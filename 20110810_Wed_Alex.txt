[00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:06.352]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.352 --> 00:00:08.113]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.113 --> 00:00:09.874]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:11.475]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:13.015]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:17.197]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:21.319]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:42.768]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:47.394]  It is Wednesday, the 10th day of August, 2011.
[00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:54.763]  And we have laid out for the last decade that when the financial collapse began, by design due to derivatives,
[00:00:55.808 --> 00:01:15.397]  That the welfare class would begin to riot, even if they needed to be basically directed to riot, as a pretext to menace what's left for the middle class to accept a high-tech police state, a rollout of TSA-style domestic checkpoints.
[00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:22.001]  And that then the so-called left would call for even more goodies to the quote, disadvantaged underclass.
[00:01:23.228 --> 00:01:25.309]  And hold the public hostage.
[00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:51.278]  Now what's really happening is the mega-rich that get most of their wealth through government welfare, corporate welfare in one way or another, they smokescreen all of their activities by always focusing on the poor that are getting welfare, while at the same time they push to give the poor more welfare, creating these spoiled, rotten, dependency-laden, dysfunctional, crime-ridden cultures.
[00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.292]  And it's the same all over the world.
[00:01:55.292 --> 00:02:09.970]  And it is predominantly the welfare class that then is able to get the cheap seats at soccer, football, basketball games, and who go and riot and burn down parts of cities and beat people to death whenever their team wins or loses.
[00:02:11.912 --> 00:02:17.994]  This is the culture of gangster hooliganism, and that's what you're seeing in England.
[00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:23.135]  Some people are lauding this as wondrous, beautiful revolution.
[00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:27.977]  Revolution would be against Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America.
[00:02:27.977 --> 00:02:36.219]  The revolution would be against the Queen of England, it would be against David Cameron, it would be against the Parliament.
[00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:40.954]  And then you have to judge, is it a good revolution or a bad revolution?
[00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:44.417]  And that comes from your perspective and what you stand for.
[00:02:44.417 --> 00:03:04.235]  But carjacking people, burning down family businesses, burning down homes, and running over people that try to protect their businesses, and killing them, as happened this last night, running over and killing South Asian immigrants to England, trying to guard their businesses,
[00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:07.708]  That is not revolution.
[00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:18.634]  Now, the George Soros-Al Gore types, who've been calling for Arab Springs, Al Gore, here in the United States and Europe, they will praise it.
[00:03:18.634 --> 00:03:21.436]  And they will call it a revolution.
[00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:23.337]  Because it's exactly what they want.
[00:03:24.457 --> 00:03:29.761]  So that the apparatus of the state can come in as the arbiter and as the referee.
[00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:32.864]  And that is what is really going on here.
[00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:35.786]  At the end of the day we're going to be breaking it all down.
[00:03:35.786 --> 00:03:42.111]  We have Patrick Henningsen who was a witness and had to barricade himself in for his safety in South London.
[00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:46.155]  He'll be joining us again coming up for about 15 minutes at the start of the next hour.
[00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:47.115]  And then Max Keiser.
[00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:49.237]  Max Keiser contacted us.
[00:03:49.237 --> 00:03:56.462]  He said we're all wrong about this not being a revolution against tyranny.
[00:03:56.462 --> 00:04:02.906]  And so we'll be enlightened by Max coming up at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.962]  Now, um, when we come back I'm going to discuss the fact that I guess this is Revolution 2.
[00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:18.124]  San Francisco Giants fans on Craigslist declared today Beat a Dodger Day.
[00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:19.945]  Encourage murder of a Dodgers fan.
[00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:26.700]  Twitter's refusing to take down people's accounts that call for violence and torching.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:36.029]  Well, Twitter was admittedly set up by the CIA, and through the State Department has been running destabilization campaigns, and so of course they would do such a thing.
[00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.392]  Now, if we called for murder on our platform, we'd be shut down in hours.
[00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:41.974]  You better believe it.
[00:04:41.974 --> 00:04:43.796]  But when they do, it's A-OK.
[00:04:43.796 --> 00:04:47.519]  Boston Bruins win Stanley Cup, Vancouver fans riot.
[00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.480]  Yes, that's revolution.
[00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:51.827]  Here's another one.
[00:04:51.827 --> 00:04:52.027]  L.A.
[00:04:52.027 --> 00:04:54.812]  struck by basketball riots.
[00:04:54.812 --> 00:04:57.758]  Guess that's revolution.
[00:04:57.758 --> 00:04:59.200]  NYPD.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.922]  We'll tell you more.
[00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:04.547]  And you're subject to other police action.
[00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:05.808]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.808 --> 00:05:09.689]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.970]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.832]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:24.075]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.515 --> 00:05:30.459]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:34.662]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.662 --> 00:05:38.945]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:44.910]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.452]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:50.433]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:50.874]  It's here.

[00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:12.445]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:07:12.445 --> 00:07:19.228]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:27.557]  They sow pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:07:29.677 --> 00:07:34.258]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:07:34.258 --> 00:07:38.100]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.320]  Others don't.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.461]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.241]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:46.142]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:50.363]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:52.764]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:55.465]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:07:55.465 --> 00:07:57.826]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:07:57.826 --> 00:07:58.706]  Others don't.
[00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:20.963]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.963 --> 00:08:21.864]  We are live.
[00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:23.625]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:26.627]  It is Wednesday, the 10th day of August, 2011.
[00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:34.753]  And we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:08:34.753 --> 00:08:39.436]  Well, these are the times that try men and women's souls.
[00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:49.761]  A great period of unrest and upheaval is now upon us as a society, as a world.
[00:08:50.612 --> 00:08:55.279]  We have been in the throes of a depression globally for at least three years.
[00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:03.592]  It is now intensifying and is only going to get worse from here on out unless we remove the corrupt
[00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:21.954]  ruling class that have seized control of the world economy through fraud, namely through fractional reserve banking, and then the last 12 years through derivatives, which allow them to create unlimited counterfeit financial instruments.
[00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:41.718]  Now it has always been the ruling class's established rule to control large cities, going back thousands of years, by having large different segments of the population living in welfare slums that are funded by the government.
[00:09:41.718 --> 00:09:43.839]  The Romans did this more than 2,000 years ago.
[00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:47.061]  They had a bread and also a silver allotment.
[00:09:47.984 --> 00:10:07.552]  And any time that the surrounding rural gentry did not pay the high taxes or do what they were told, the welfare crowds would be released, the Roman military would stand down, and the welfare hordes would exit the city and begin robbing and looting and stealing and burning.
[00:10:08.636 --> 00:10:22.788]  You could then not count on the Roman Fire Department to give you any assistance, also in the city, in your burning neighborhood, if you'd not paid them large amounts of protection money.
[00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:32.056]  No, it was not the American-Italian La Cosa Nostra that invented the threats of burning down your family clothier or grocery store or furniture store.
[00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:37.725]  If you did not pay them protection money, it was their Roman ancestors.
[00:10:37.725 --> 00:10:47.701]  And that's where Julius Caesar's family made most of their money and got into political power, was running the fire department racket.
[00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:53.195]  Our fire departments today are not engaged in such activities.
[00:10:53.195 --> 00:10:58.797]  Just to be clear before the New York Times or someone else says that I'm stating that modern fire departments don't.
[00:10:58.797 --> 00:11:07.700]  I'm talking about what is Italy today and of course formerly the Empire, the Roman Empire based in the city of Rome.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:07.960]  Okay.
[00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:25.209]  Before I get into the global financial meltdown, before I get into the day four of uncontrolled riots, the British Prime Minister says they might use water cannons and batons later if the rioters don't behave themselves.
[00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:52.948]  This is just like in Seattle in 1999 when the police even admitted they were ordered to stand down and let rioters burn things, destroy things for a day before they then attacked the peaceful demonstrators and set the precedent nationwide to no longer even allow peaceful demonstrations and to have Darth Vader festooned, garbed police attack the general population of peaceful protesters.
[00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:54.489]  And that's all this is here.
[00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:57.910]  What we suspected is now coming out.
[00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:05.973]  Even the BBC is admitting that police were ordered four nights ago to stand down in South London where all of this began.
[00:12:05.973 --> 00:12:14.537]  We now have the reports that the rioters all over the country, all over what is England within the UK, that region,
[00:12:16.998 --> 00:12:30.668]  Are being directed and promised payments if they will riot by men claiming to be part of the media, probably police operative provocateurs.
[00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:34.190]  We've also seen this go on in Greece as well.
[00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:40.035]  Going back two years ago, their national news documented it was police rioting and starting the riots.
[00:12:41.747 --> 00:12:59.403]  And then we also documented that what three years ago national news had to admit it later in Canada that the Royal Mounted Police did dress up like anarchists and begin breaking and smashing and stealing so they could then have the police attack the peaceful crowds protesting the North American Union meeting.
[00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:01.625]  So what they've done is they've primed the pump.
[00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:13.929]  They have provocateured the first events, and then the larger hooligan mass rushes in to expand the crisis.
[00:13:13.929 --> 00:13:21.636]  And then David Cameron's not in trouble for the News Corp hacking gate anymore and the mysterious deaths.
[00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:27.080]  David Cameron can move forward now with tax increases to satiate the welfare zombie mobs.
[00:13:28.835 --> 00:13:34.402]  This is a standard operating procedure and I'm going to be going over it.
[00:13:34.402 --> 00:13:44.434]  But as for the individuals that are doing this, as for the general mobs,
[00:13:46.238 --> 00:13:52.023]  Some of it at the beginning was racially motivated, and I guess you could say in a way that's political.
[00:13:52.023 --> 00:14:06.414]  But from the hundreds of emails and comments I've gotten from reporters that live in the area that we've talked to on air, from Steve Watson who lives in London, from Paul Watson north of London, this is purely
[00:14:07.372 --> 00:14:19.758]  Purely in the second, third, and fourth day, groups of hooligans, the folks who like to go get drunk and get in fights at soccer games as part of their tribalism outlet.
[00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:24.399]  Black, white, you name it, who are engaging in pure looting.
[00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:32.523]  In fact, I saw one report of an entire business district, shop district, burned, leveled, and looted, except for a bookstore.
[00:14:32.523 --> 00:14:33.864]  The looters had no interest in that.
[00:14:33.864 --> 00:14:43.529]  Electronic stores, liquor stores, pawn shops, furniture stores, anything of value looted and stolen.
[00:14:44.469 --> 00:14:54.593]  And then you have the so-called left saying this is the beginning of the Stalinistic uprising against the bourgeoisie and then the ruling class.
[00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:58.075]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:14:58.075 --> 00:15:02.096]  You have the rise of hooliganism in South Africa.
[00:15:02.096 --> 00:15:04.737]  You have the rise of it in Brazil.
[00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:08.659]  You have the rise of it in Los Angeles, in New York, in Chicago.
[00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:12.616]  You do not have the rise of it in Dallas.
[00:15:12.616 --> 00:15:19.460]  Because if you try to pull people out of their cars in Dallas, and it's happened a few times, in these hooligan riots, you are shot dead.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.041]  Let me tell you something.
[00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:23.623]  A police officer has citizen's arrest power.
[00:15:23.623 --> 00:15:25.484]  That's why citizens have citizen arrest power.
[00:15:26.297 --> 00:15:35.580]  Counties and cities get together and then elect a sheriff or elect a mayor who creates a police force of men and women that have citizen's arrest power.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:42.302]  You try to pull me out of my car and beat me up or kill me or rape my wife, I'm going to kill you.
[00:15:42.302 --> 00:15:44.962]  And that is under common law.
[00:15:44.962 --> 00:15:46.203]  Thousands of years old.
[00:15:47.276 --> 00:15:54.259]  And so you notice you don't have these type of things going on in Dallas, Texas.
[00:15:54.259 --> 00:15:57.241]  You don't have this type of stuff going on in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:15:58.092 --> 00:16:05.979]  You don't have this type of stuff going on because when you start burning buildings down, that is an act of arson in action.
[00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:10.763]  You are committing acts that could and probably will kill people.
[00:16:10.763 --> 00:16:19.210]  And if I catch people trying to burn my house or my neighbor's house, I'm gonna put a bead on you and I'm gonna unload into you and your cohorts.
[00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.371]  Understand that.
[00:16:21.394 --> 00:16:33.797]  The globalists want law and order to break down so they can come in after the looting rages for weeks or even months, as has been done in many other countries as part of the IMF World Bank plan that was leaked in 2002.
[00:16:33.797 --> 00:16:34.937]  We've covered so much.
[00:16:34.937 --> 00:16:36.798]  They call it the IMF riot.
[00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:48.921]  And after it's run its course, the country's confidence is destroyed, the stocks are destroyed, the nation is in trouble, and the big offshore banks come in and take even more control.
[00:16:50.828 --> 00:16:53.491]  Even more control.
[00:16:53.491 --> 00:16:57.175]  And so where do you see these riots taking place?
[00:16:57.175 --> 00:17:07.547]  You see them taking place in social engineering, multicultural, globalist-run warrens of modern nanny states.
[00:17:07.547 --> 00:17:09.850]  The first thing a nanny state does, and in the U.S.
[00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.312]  they can't do it nationwide so they've done it city by city,
[00:17:13.464 --> 00:17:18.995]  New York, Chicago, LA, Boston to a certain extent.
[00:17:18.995 --> 00:17:24.024]  The first thing they do in a disarmed ninny state is disarm the public.
[00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:27.451]  Once that happens, they double or triple the police force.
[00:17:27.451 --> 00:17:29.532]  You go to New York, there's cops every 10 feet.
[00:17:29.532 --> 00:17:30.813]  They're not there to help you.
[00:17:30.813 --> 00:17:37.258]  They look like something out of a movie, of a cartoon style, police state, third world thug.
[00:17:37.258 --> 00:17:38.418]  They're shaking people down.
[00:17:38.418 --> 00:17:39.939]  They're engaging in crimes.
[00:17:39.939 --> 00:17:41.921]  They leave the basic criminals alone.
[00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:46.324]  But if they see mainline productive citizens, they set upon you and feed on you.
[00:17:47.719 --> 00:18:00.524]  So, first they disarm you, then they double or triple the police, then they come in with massive taxes and destroy the middle class and invite welfare pimps in from all over the country as Mayor Bloomberg does.
[00:18:02.105 --> 00:18:11.553]  Once they've got that in place, any time the public doesn't do exactly what the ruling class wants, they just turn the welfare mobs loose.
[00:18:11.553 --> 00:18:14.495]  They can rape, they can steal, they can do whatever they want.
[00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:19.520]  And if it just so happens to be a quote minority, who's really the majority in this country now, in almost every area.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:28.947]  If they happen to assault the devil Whitey, who's been singled out as the devil and is open season, if you fight back, you are charged with hate crimes.
[00:18:28.947 --> 00:18:32.049]  And then no one debates the fact that you were defending yourself.
[00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:38.274]  You were hauled up before a special Soviet court, a special commissar court, and you were sent to prison.
[00:18:39.437 --> 00:18:44.599]  This is going to be the model of class war, race war, government-directed.
[00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:56.643]  Now, as things continue to collapse, as the rural communities collapse, they're going to bring in the Homeland Security Defense Department-run rural councils, with your own little Soviet commissars over you.
[00:18:56.643 --> 00:19:05.385]  Cattle tail squads, TSA checkpoints on the highways, home inspections of law-abiding citizens, while the criminals are allowed to rule.
[00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:06.666]  Rule and dominate.
[00:19:07.526 --> 00:19:13.310]  I see what looks like recent model trucks every day when I drive to work.
[00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:22.697]  Of people trying to build roads and haul aggregates and deliver things.
[00:19:22.697 --> 00:19:25.899]  And I see the truck police pulling them over and harassing them.
[00:19:25.899 --> 00:19:27.880]  And going over every inch of their truck.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.483]  But I can drive five miles from here and buy crack cocaine right now.
[00:19:31.483 --> 00:19:32.944]  You can go buy it right now.
[00:19:32.944 --> 00:19:34.245]  And the police won't do anything to stop it.
[00:19:35.797 --> 00:19:38.559]  America is run by criminals.
[00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:40.161]  At the top, they feed on us.
[00:19:40.161 --> 00:19:41.862]  At the bottom, they feed on us.
[00:19:41.862 --> 00:19:57.015]  The ultra-elite have created absolutely domesticated, spoiled, brat, third, fourth, fifth generation welfare heads who love their prison gangster culture, and they are the army of the New World Order.
[00:20:00.598 --> 00:20:06.541]  HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping.
[00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:12.064]  Our product line has grown from 5 to nearly 100 items in less than 5 years.

[00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:39.059]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:46.124]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.124 --> 00:20:50.247]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:21:59.702 --> 00:22:04.143]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:22:04.143 --> 00:22:05.644]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:22:05.644 --> 00:22:14.547]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:22:14.547 --> 00:22:17.708]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:22:17.708 --> 00:22:19.008]  But take heart.
[00:22:19.008 --> 00:22:22.809]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:22:22.809 --> 00:22:27.811]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:32.052]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:22:32.052 --> 00:22:33.793]  The globalists are scared.
[00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:35.113]  They've overreached.
[00:22:35.113 --> 00:22:38.634]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[00:22:38.634 --> 00:22:40.895]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:22:53.999 --> 00:22:56.100]  We are going to use their system against them.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.802]  The InfoWar now goes into high gear.
[00:22:59.802 --> 00:23:01.403]  Meet Jerry D. Hi.
[00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:10.587]  Jerry and his family, like you, are very concerned about world conditions and have gathered many emergency preparedness items, including turtle tuft shelters.
[00:23:10.587 --> 00:23:19.732]  We have added two 24-foot turtle tufts to our supplies and feel very secure knowing our large family is ready for whatever the future may bring.
[00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:22.585]  TurtleTuff shelters are not tents.
[00:23:22.585 --> 00:23:32.673]  They are permanent yet portable four-season geodesic frame shelters that are as strong as a cabin at a fraction of the cost and are easy to set up, take down, and move anywhere.
[00:23:32.673 --> 00:23:34.315]  Available in two sizes.
[00:23:34.315 --> 00:23:39.198]  Get your TurtleTuff shelter and accessories included at TurtleTuffShelters.com.
[00:23:39.198 --> 00:23:42.541]  That's TurtleTuffShelters.com.

[00:23:49.948 --> 00:23:53.258]  Or see them online at Turtletoughshelters.com.
[00:23:53.258 --> 00:23:54.702]  Turtletoughshelters.
[00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:56.869]  Your all-season home away from home.
[00:24:17.496 --> 00:24:34.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists know that as the economy is imploded by design, as world currencies are devalued, that the first groups that are going to get really upset and angry are the welfare classes.
[00:24:34.685 --> 00:24:44.231]  You'll still get your welfare check, you'll still get your Lone Star card, or in other states they have different names, your digital food stamp card, but
[00:24:45.802 --> 00:24:51.185]  The allotment you get will not purchase what it did in the past.
[00:24:51.185 --> 00:25:06.233]  And so, when these groups start going out, rioting and looting, because they've got to have the bling, in this Madison Avenue society, their rioting is going to be used to take everyone's liberties.
[00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:16.443]  And I've said that over and over again in the years leading up to this, and I guess a lot of people haven't listened to me.
[00:25:19.577 --> 00:25:41.810]  Because even if it's staged, even if it's socially engineered, still, if a group of marauding looters is coming your way, and you live in England and you don't have a right to defend yourself, you're going to beg for the army to come in and shoot the looters, who are also burning down people's homes and dragging folks out of their cars.
[00:25:47.083 --> 00:26:01.652]  And the liberal trendy out there has had their capacity for self-preservation removed from them.
[00:26:01.652 --> 00:26:05.675]  They have had their capacity
[00:26:07.418 --> 00:26:08.879]  To think rationally removed.
[00:26:08.879 --> 00:26:19.825]  I mean the Brits have allowed themselves to have their firearms taken to the point of yesterday the best-selling items on Amazon UK were aluminum baseball bats.
[00:26:19.825 --> 00:26:31.771]  As people desperately, I mean you lived in the UK where you can't have a firearm to defend yourself and you didn't already have a sword, you didn't already have a ball-peen hammer, you didn't already have a baseball bat.
[00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:40.371]  What's wrong with you?
[00:26:40.371 --> 00:26:44.595]  And then now, as we go into the fourth day, David Cameron has held back force.
[00:26:44.595 --> 00:26:51.480]  They won't even use water cannons or rubber bullets for four days.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:27:05.812]  And now the crime has exploded, the burning has exploded, and there are members of the British Parliament now calling to shoot looters on sight.
[00:27:05.812 --> 00:27:06.693]  And I have to say,
[00:27:08.444 --> 00:27:15.452]  That if you see someone looting your business here in the United States, it is your right to shoot and kill them.
[00:27:15.452 --> 00:27:18.875]  And for some that have been domesticated, that is a shocking statement.
[00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:24.121]  If you don't have that attitude, you live in a domesticated, prostrate position.
[00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:28.466]  And I can't believe so many men have been gelded to the point they don't understand that.
[00:27:31.573 --> 00:27:43.709]  If someone is running around in the city, this is confirmed, lighting fires to family dwellings, that is attempted murder.
[00:27:43.709 --> 00:27:47.655]  Women and children have had to jump from burning buildings to firefighters.
[00:27:49.548 --> 00:27:53.131]  Who themselves are being attacked by the looters.
[00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:57.975]  And some are calling it extreme to call to arm the fire departments.
[00:27:57.975 --> 00:28:02.658]  Arm the police, arm the fire departments, arm the citizens.
[00:28:02.658 --> 00:28:04.620]  And that's how they first got gun control in England.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.642]  They said, well, we're not gonna let cops have guns.
[00:28:06.642 --> 00:28:08.883]  And then, of course, citizens shouldn't be able to.
[00:28:08.883 --> 00:28:13.067]  And then, voila, they then armed the police.
[00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:16.650]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is not knee-jerk reaction.
[00:28:18.308 --> 00:28:25.071]  To call for shooting people that are setting fires to buildings.
[00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:34.316]  And people ask me, they say, how can you have an article like, knee-jerk calls for army on London streets to shoot looters on sight?
[00:28:34.316 --> 00:28:38.278]  Because there isn't prior constraint on my writers.
[00:28:38.278 --> 00:28:40.599]  There isn't prior constraint, there's no prior constraint on me.
[00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:45.261]  I have people that I know of research, understand geopolitical situations.
[00:28:45.261 --> 00:28:47.402]  But then you get a cultural divide though,
[00:28:48.527 --> 00:29:01.781]  With somebody who's a degreed political scientist like Steve Watson, born and bred in England, who thinks it's shocking to see a member of parliament say, this is into day four, they're burning people's houses down, shoot them.
[00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:07.327]  Folks, if the police started shooting people day one, this would have ended overnight.
[00:29:07.327 --> 00:29:09.109]  But it shouldn't be the police shooting them.
[00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:25.883]  In a free society, you come to my house and try to set fire to it, or I see you throwing Moloff cocktails at my neighbor's house, I am gonna kneel down, put the sight on you, and squeeze the trigger.
[00:29:28.424 --> 00:29:32.786]  But see, people don't do this type of stuff in Texas.
[00:29:32.786 --> 00:29:35.347]  They don't do this type of stuff in Oklahoma.
[00:29:35.347 --> 00:29:40.389]  They don't do this type of stuff in Vermont, or New Hampshire, or Alabama.
[00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:44.451]  Because you come and try to burn somebody's house down, you die!
[00:29:44.451 --> 00:29:50.814]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.814 --> 00:29:52.214]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.214 --> 00:29:54.736]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.736 --> 00:29:57.437]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:06.379]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:30:06.379 --> 00:30:12.803]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:30:12.803 --> 00:30:15.085]  Number one, study the past.
[00:30:15.085 --> 00:30:17.486]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:30:17.486 --> 00:30:21.209]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:25.424]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:29.267]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:30:29.267 --> 00:30:38.314]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:30:38.314 --> 00:30:41.717]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:30:41.717 --> 00:30:45.360]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:30:46.201 --> 00:30:51.142]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:30:51.142 --> 00:30:55.743]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:30:55.743 --> 00:31:00.864]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:00.864 --> 00:31:15.307]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:21.033]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:21.033 --> 00:31:33.798]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:31:33.798 --> 00:31:41.061]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:31:41.761 --> 00:31:52.129]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:31:52.129 --> 00:31:56.051]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:59.174]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:32:00.902 --> 00:32:02.604]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.604 --> 00:32:07.910]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.452]  Saving means to make money.
[00:32:09.452 --> 00:32:18.242]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:32:18.963 --> 00:32:26.508]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:32:26.508 --> 00:32:34.513]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:32:34.513 --> 00:32:41.917]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:32:44.639 --> 00:32:45.239]  Big Brother.
[00:32:45.239 --> 00:32:46.140]  Mainstream media.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.300]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:13.416 --> 00:33:15.360]  You want answers?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.263]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:17.263 --> 00:33:23.575]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.744 --> 00:34:00.880]  You know, if you're watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv as we stream the radio show in Living Color, you could see the footage we're about to play in Vancouver, Canada of people rioting and burning things when their team lost, or when people's teams win, large areas in major cities of Brazil being burned.
[00:34:02.455 --> 00:34:03.015]  I don't know.
[00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:23.454]  This is beautiful, this is wonderful.
[00:34:23.454 --> 00:34:33.243]  No, it's not revolution when San Francisco Giants fans post on Craigslist, beat a Dodger day, encourage murder of a Dodgers fan.
[00:34:33.243 --> 00:34:35.405]  That's a quote.
[00:34:35.405 --> 00:34:41.170]  And Twitter is saying that they're going to continue to leave the accounts up of people.
[00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.032]  Who are calling for violence, burning and looting on Twitter.
[00:34:46.032 --> 00:34:53.696]  Well, of course, Twitter was used to overthrow the old dictator, Hazim Mubarak.
[00:34:53.696 --> 00:35:00.320]  It was used to then help put in the Muslim Brotherhood and oppress people even more.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.501]  Because that's what the CIA and MI6 wanted.
[00:35:03.658 --> 00:35:19.290]  And now Twitter is being used over in England according to looting and robbing and burning because the government's going to use it to ram through curfews and martial law rules and to shoot people on site for politically protesting.
[00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:24.113]  You see, this is a more drawn out version of what happened in 1999 when for 24 hours the hired
[00:35:28.055 --> 00:35:31.577]  Warehoused anarchists were flown in by major foundations.
[00:35:31.577 --> 00:35:34.679]  I have it all on video in Police State 2.
[00:35:34.679 --> 00:35:36.040]  The takeover.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:44.646]  The police on tape admitting they were ordered to stand down and let the looters attack and burn in Seattle so the news could say, why don't they do something?
[00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:46.667]  Why don't they stand up against them?
[00:35:46.667 --> 00:35:53.832]  So then the looters could pull back, move into a government building right next to the police department under police guard.
[00:35:54.983 --> 00:36:06.713]  Flown in, and so the police could then attack old ladies who were part of the protest against the World Trade Organization.
[00:36:06.713 --> 00:36:10.296]  Now, that's all that's happening here.
[00:36:10.296 --> 00:36:22.947]  That's all that's happening here, is the police stood down Sunday, they stood down Monday, they stood down Tuesday, and now David Cameron, that carbon tax-promoting, New World Order slimebag,
[00:36:24.201 --> 00:36:31.665]  is saying that we might use water cannons on a 24-hour notice.
[00:36:31.665 --> 00:36:32.986]  It's ridiculous.
[00:36:32.986 --> 00:36:35.568]  They know who these people are.
[00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:52.538]  They could have, three days ago, off of positive IDs of thousands of these people, arrested them, put them on the news, made an example of them, but instead they're gonna let it get out of control, out of control, out of control, until finally the police start shooting people with real bullets.
[00:36:54.266 --> 00:37:01.231]  And then the precedent's gonna be set not to shoot somebody trying to burn your house down.
[00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:07.195]  Not to shoot somebody trying to burn your house down.
[00:37:07.195 --> 00:37:10.338]  No.
[00:37:10.338 --> 00:37:13.160]  But shooting someone who goes and protests at the Parliament.
[00:37:13.857 --> 00:37:19.439]  You know, for several years, you haven't been allowed to protest anywhere around Parliament.
[00:37:19.439 --> 00:37:26.783]  I went there to peacefully speak on a bullhorn, and even though it was a week before the law went into place, they told me to leave or I'd be arrested.
[00:37:26.783 --> 00:37:30.824]  That's in Terror Storm, one of my films.
[00:37:30.824 --> 00:37:38.288]  If you tried to go down and burn areas of Parliament, you would have been shot Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
[00:37:38.288 --> 00:37:42.990]  But, because the hooligans, that's all this is, is a branch of the soccer hooligans,
[00:37:44.434 --> 00:38:00.448]  Because they're burning down five-generation clothiers and four-generation watch shops and four-generation furniture shops because they're dragging people out of their cars at barricades and beating them up.
[00:38:00.448 --> 00:38:05.252]  Because that's happening, the police are standing down to let this get out of hand.
[00:38:05.252 --> 00:38:09.836]  So the giant police state the British government has set up, the UK government has set up, can be
[00:38:10.842 --> 00:38:16.105]  Drop down like a hammer vice on the public of England.
[00:38:16.105 --> 00:38:19.947]  And so I agree with Steve Watson from one angle.
[00:38:19.947 --> 00:38:30.253]  If you're just looking at this in a two dimensional way, knee jerk calls for army on London streets to shoot looters on site.
[00:38:30.253 --> 00:38:32.314]  Well, that would mean somebody out after dark, wouldn't it?
[00:38:33.831 --> 00:38:42.938]  But then it goes on, the Member of Parliament said, time to get tough, bring in the army, shoot looters and arsonists on site.
[00:38:42.938 --> 00:38:45.500]  Arsonists should be shot on site.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:53.206]  And people attacking fire department people, already risking their lives battling fires with women jumping out of it, they should be shot.
[00:38:53.206 --> 00:38:55.848]  That's attempted murder.
[00:38:55.848 --> 00:39:00.572]  Setting fires to people's houses and business is an act that could kill a lot of people.
[00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:07.193]  If I ran up to you with a burning torch and said, I'm going to set you on fire, would you have a right to defend yourself?
[00:39:07.193 --> 00:39:08.293]  Absolutely.
[00:39:08.293 --> 00:39:15.876]  But see, this is the psychological manipulation to where now they're going to hold back, not do what they're supposed to do.
[00:39:15.876 --> 00:39:16.677]  Did you tell me we had him?
[00:39:16.677 --> 00:39:17.237]  Because I didn't hear you.
[00:39:17.237 --> 00:39:18.638]  Okay, good.
[00:39:18.638 --> 00:39:20.558]  Thank you.
[00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.439]  Great.
[00:39:22.439 --> 00:39:26.961]  Because I didn't hear anything over the mic.
[00:39:26.961 --> 00:39:28.042]  What's going on here?
[00:39:29.272 --> 00:39:33.318]  Is very simple at one level, but also very sophisticated.
[00:39:33.318 --> 00:39:35.301]  It's problem, reaction, solution.
[00:39:36.127 --> 00:39:39.789]  And you've got generation after generation of people dependent on welfare.
[00:39:39.789 --> 00:39:40.810]  You've got globalism.
[00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:42.771]  You've got deindustrialization.
[00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:45.854]  You've got people living on subsistence level handouts.
[00:39:45.854 --> 00:39:49.596]  You've got a middle class scared of the giant swelling underclass.
[00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:56.681]  And you've got the social engineers who've all got their mountain retreats outside of England, outside of Europe, outside of the U.S.
[00:39:56.681 --> 00:39:59.863]  sitting back and manipulating the whole thing.
[00:39:59.863 --> 00:40:02.204]  And I predicted it all with precision.
[00:40:02.204 --> 00:40:05.286]  I told you a year ago, six months ago, over and over again.
[00:40:05.286 --> 00:40:05.987]  Find the clips.
[00:40:06.547 --> 00:40:29.632]  Where I said society is going to degenerate, the austerity is going to come in, the welfare hordes are going to riot, an expanded version of a sports riot, the middle class is going to get scared, the globalists are going to stand back, let the riots run their course, and then later, when the public is begging for total tyranny, come in and beg for it.
[00:40:31.519 --> 00:40:37.742]  Come in and beg for the end of Magna Carta, the end of the Bill of Rights, the end of the Constitution.
[00:40:37.742 --> 00:40:40.924]  And that's what has to be articulated out to everyone.
[00:40:40.924 --> 00:40:47.548]  Now, joining us is Steve Watson, who does a great job writing at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:47.548 --> 00:40:59.034]  But I tell you, Steve, it's a good article you wrote, but if people just go with the headline, knee-jerk calls for army on London streets to shoot looters on sight, if the police would have just done their job,
[00:40:59.634 --> 00:41:00.714]  Well, you do what you can, obviously.
[00:41:00.714 --> 00:41:02.835]  But, um, I mean, this is a big story we've got today.
[00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:03.675]  The police were ordered to
[00:41:19.713 --> 00:41:23.475]  We've got videos of these sort of vigilante groups springing up now.
[00:41:49.907 --> 00:42:18.900]  Which is a very complex thing, because they're made up not only of people that genuinely do want to protect their community, and rightly so, and their families and stuff like that, in the absence of the police doing so, but, you know, these groups are also made up of a different kind of job mentality, and it's this sort of division between these communities
[00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:24.728]  What we've been talking about for so long that we've seen come into fruition now.
[00:42:24.728 --> 00:42:41.483]  Absolutely, as society breaks into gangs, and the article is at PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, this is big news when you get this out to everybody, but we also need to point out that the police many times, if they can't get welfare folks to riot, they'll go out and do it themselves, dressed as anarchists.
[00:42:41.963 --> 00:42:48.567]  But also my film Police State 2 The Takeover details how this was done in the United States.
[00:42:48.567 --> 00:42:49.748]  But here it is.
[00:42:49.748 --> 00:42:53.950]  Police were ordered to stand down as London burned.
[00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.872]  Inadequate response led to call for martial law.
[00:42:57.532 --> 00:43:19.965]  So I see the angle that it's knee-jerk to call for shooting people, but if you had the citizenry being armed, as is an ancient right of any free man, if someone came to your home to burn it down, which is happening in massive levels, then you would have a right to shoot and kill the person trying to set your house on fire.
[00:43:19.965 --> 00:43:22.027]  So we see this unnatural
[00:43:23.007 --> 00:43:45.193]  Abhorrent social engineering system working perfectly where you've got disarmed populations barricaded in their homes with them being set alight and the police standing down until the public begs for absolute iron fist to protect them not knowing that will set the precedent for the iron fist to be used against them in the future.
[00:43:45.193 --> 00:43:47.994]  Exactly, and we've got the other thing we've got out today is
[00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:52.918]  This is in the article I've written, a YouGov poll.
[00:43:52.918 --> 00:43:56.760]  YouGov is the biggest pollster in this country.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:07.745]  This poll was conducted for the tabloid The Sun, which is obviously not the most credible newspaper, but the point is it's YouGov, it's not The Sun that's saying this.
[00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:10.907]  And they've done a poll amongst the population of Britain
[00:44:11.818 --> 00:44:17.899]  Which confirms that, you know, people are demanding this sort of crackdown, this police state.
[00:44:17.899 --> 00:44:29.221]  We've got, in this poll, 90% of the British public want immediate water cannons on the streets, shooting people with high-velocity water jets.
[00:44:29.221 --> 00:44:31.701]  78% want tear gas.
[00:44:31.701 --> 00:44:36.922]  72% want police to start tasering people indiscriminately.
[00:44:36.922 --> 00:44:40.303]  84% want mounted police on horses.
[00:44:41.478 --> 00:45:04.912]  65% want plastic bullets, 82% want curfews, 77% of the population want the army on the streets, and a third, one in three people, want the army or the police to start using live ammunition indiscriminately to sort of instant justice against these rioters.
[00:45:04.912 --> 00:45:07.514]  So this is what I'm talking about in this article, this kind of
[00:45:08.624 --> 00:45:23.336]  I need your reaction to this, what essentially is, for most cases, obviously not in the cases of the buildings that have been burned and everything, but in most cases, it is just kids burning bins in the street.
[00:45:23.336 --> 00:45:29.001]  It's just, that is a complete overreaction to it.
[00:45:29.001 --> 00:45:34.365]  And it gives you an idea of how dangerous and close we are to sort of
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:51.051]  Having these things implemented, because we've got MPs and MEPs also calling for the army on the streets, so if you've got, you know, a large portion of the population calling for it, and it's them being backed up by MPs on the news, then
[00:45:52.338 --> 00:45:54.919]  I think things are getting a little bit dangerously close here.
[00:46:12.405 --> 00:46:18.471]  Uh, comes out and says, quote, time to get tough, bring in the army, shoot looters and arsonists on site.
[00:46:18.471 --> 00:46:23.255]  Then when he got attacked for that, he said, let's try water cannon plastic rounds first.
[00:46:23.255 --> 00:46:26.899]  But if the police lose control completely, tougher measures are called for.
[00:46:26.899 --> 00:46:33.344]  Well, let me answer this question, Steve, because the police have stood down, obviously, so the president can be set for martial law.
[00:46:34.185 --> 00:46:40.267]  What are citizens supposed to do as these hooligans come around robbing, stealing, raping, burning?
[00:46:40.267 --> 00:46:51.071]  I mean, we had three vigilantes trying to protect their businesses, as they're called last night, run over and murdered by the looters.
[00:46:51.071 --> 00:46:53.152]  So what about the looters' violence?
[00:46:53.152 --> 00:46:54.613]  We have this unnatural event.
[00:46:55.473 --> 00:47:09.318]  Of millions of people not allowed to defend themselves, the police standing down with their wicked social engineer masters, and again, I don't know how often you listen, Steve, but I've been harping on this for years.
[00:47:09.318 --> 00:47:23.723]  Global collapse, public not allowed to defend themselves, looting running rampant, then the public finally relinquishes all liberties to the super state to protect them, giant crackdown on entire population.
[00:47:23.723 --> 00:47:24.663]  That's how it works here.
[00:47:28.536 --> 00:47:33.277]  Right, so you're asking me what are people supposed to do to stop that?
[00:47:49.341 --> 00:47:58.546]  And that's why the British media is demonizing anybody protecting their shop, you know, with a baseball bat, even as they're run over with cars, because they want this to get out of hand.
[00:47:58.546 --> 00:48:07.291]  But see, the natural response is happening to any red-blooded man that sees people running around pulling folks out of cars and burning down businesses and houses.
[00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:11.973]  Any red-blooded person wants to go out instinctively and face these people down.
[00:48:11.973 --> 00:48:18.417]  It's an ancient instinct that if there's ravaging looters and plunderers coming through the countryside,
[00:48:18.797 --> 00:48:22.880]  Yeah, that's the natural reaction, but then I think it's more complex than that in this case because you've got
[00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:47.859]  The police standing back doing nothing and then you've got a certain portion of people who do want to do that, who do genuinely want to get out there and protect their property and their families.
[00:48:47.859 --> 00:48:55.767]  But you've also got a certain group of people who are just going along the, you know, the sort of gang division mentality, who are just...
[00:48:57.077 --> 00:49:01.760]  In many ways, just as bad as these riots is, they just want to get out there and smash some heads.
[00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:38.781]  And if there's people that want to go out, and that's called gangism, to want to go out with a baseball bat and face down a bunch of other people, and if that's what people find to be emboldening to their spirit, it's a lot better than sitting inside watching it on the television and letting it happen.
[00:49:39.241 --> 00:49:49.909]  And I am a primitive at the end of the day, but I totally understand people who instinctively see cities burning and want to go out and face the people down.
[00:49:49.909 --> 00:49:53.191]  And if there's some thugs wanting to join them, so be it.
[00:49:53.191 --> 00:49:58.755]  It takes a lot of different type of people to make the world go around, but Steve, very interesting article.
[00:49:59.335 --> 00:50:09.641]  And a very informative article as well by your brother, Paul Watson, dealing with the fact that the police have now been caught and have admitted they were ordered to stand down.
[00:50:09.641 --> 00:50:12.163]  Police were ordered to stand down as London burned.
[00:50:12.163 --> 00:50:15.005]  It's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:15.005 --> 00:50:18.407]  In fact, I'm going to have Paul's article red-linked, Steve.
[00:50:18.407 --> 00:50:23.010]  But I think also the good news is baseball bats have gone on record level of sales.
[00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.171]  I haven't got myself a bat yet, no.
[00:50:25.171 --> 00:50:28.893]  I've got lots of blunt instruments lying around though, so I can pick up one of those if need be.
[00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:55.254]  We disagree a bit on this issue, but I see his angle.
[00:50:55.254 --> 00:50:57.315]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[00:50:57.315 --> 00:50:59.136]  I'm going to give the number out to folks in England.
[00:50:59.136 --> 00:51:00.017]  Just callers in England.

[00:52:36.906 --> 00:52:37.326]  I think so.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:05.982]  Hey, Brian, if you could do just one thing today to ensure your family's food security, what would it be?
[00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:06.983]  That's easy, Bill.
[00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:11.124]  I'd head straight to SoupBeanSurvival.com.
[00:53:11.124 --> 00:53:12.625]  SoupBeanSurvival.com?
[00:53:12.625 --> 00:53:22.568]  I know, Bill, it sounds crazy, but this ancient secret has been around for over 8,000 years, and it truly is nature's super survival food.
[00:53:22.788 --> 00:53:23.388]  Really, Brian?
[00:53:23.388 --> 00:53:25.410]  The number one survival food?
[00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.531]  Well, certainly the forgotten survival food.
[00:53:27.531 --> 00:53:28.551]  Absolutely, Bill.
[00:53:28.551 --> 00:53:39.978]  The folks at soupbeansurvival.com scoured our planet to find the very best heirloom seeds to truly find nature's super survival food.
[00:53:39.978 --> 00:53:41.879]  Brian, these aren't grocery store beans, are they?
[00:53:42.239 --> 00:53:42.979]  No way, Bill.
[00:53:42.979 --> 00:53:45.660]  You're not gonna find these beans in any grocery store.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.101]  These are the absolute highest quality beans in the world.
[00:53:49.101 --> 00:53:51.762]  Visit soupbeanssurvival.com.
[00:53:51.762 --> 00:53:58.864]  That's soupbeanssurvival.com for all the information you're gonna need for nature's super survival food.
[00:53:58.864 --> 00:54:07.166]  There's a gun and ammunition
[00:54:19.918 --> 00:54:29.774]  Yeah, there's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[00:54:35.501 --> 00:54:38.762]  Use it only in emergency.
[00:54:38.762 --> 00:54:44.644]  And you see the fact that the British are absolutely open, fair game for the globalists.
[00:54:44.644 --> 00:54:54.167]  Because they bought into this fake idea of genteel civilization, giving up their swords, giving up their guns, letting a professional police force protect them.
[00:54:54.983 --> 00:54:56.064]  They won't protect you.
[00:54:56.064 --> 00:55:10.531]  And if you've got guns in New Orleans and you're high and dry with a generator in your five million dollar mansion, the military is going to come to your door six days later and say, hands up, we're taking your guns and you're never getting them back.
[00:55:10.531 --> 00:55:21.216]  Not that our individual military men and women are bad, not that the average person in the British military or the British police is bad, but the social engineers on top write handbooks on all this.
[00:55:24.238 --> 00:55:29.362]  Eighty years ago in the U.S., if a hurricane hit and there was devastation, the military would show up.
[00:55:29.362 --> 00:55:32.064]  They would be under the command of the governor.
[00:55:32.064 --> 00:55:41.711]  The governor would say, these teams of local sheriffs are going to lead the military forces on rescue operations, cleanup, and trusted members of the posse to help you.
[00:55:41.711 --> 00:55:46.715]  And they'd be going to the high and dry houses saying, sir, will you please get your firearms and come with us?
[00:55:46.715 --> 00:55:48.116]  We need your help.
[00:55:48.116 --> 00:55:49.417]  That's America!
[00:55:49.417 --> 00:55:51.078]  That's freedom!
[00:55:51.078 --> 00:55:52.079]  Not this!
[00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:53.260]  Not this garbage!
[00:55:55.834 --> 00:55:59.536]  Not the US military coming into people's houses and taking their guns!
[00:55:59.536 --> 00:56:15.583]  And you better believe, as this country implodes into hardcore depression, ladies and gentlemen, 90%, right at 90%, were agrarian and self-sufficient to some degree or entirely in the 1920s, 1930s, during the Great Depression, 1929, 1940.
[00:56:20.024 --> 00:56:22.746]  90% were self-sufficient.
[00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:35.319]  Where my family on my dad's side comes from, at the end of that depression, there wasn't hardly a deer or a possum or a raccoon left in the county.
[00:56:35.319 --> 00:56:36.820]  People make fun of folks that eat possums.
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.822]  Let me tell you something.
[00:56:38.822 --> 00:56:40.524]  When you don't have any money, there's no food at the store.
[00:56:40.524 --> 00:56:41.185]  That's what you eat.
[00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:51.914]  The point is, is that we had 7 million people, according to major universities, starved to death in the 10 years of that Great Depression.
[00:56:51.914 --> 00:56:59.398]  7 million souls starved to death with a country 90% self-sufficient.
[00:56:59.398 --> 00:57:00.479]  Now, less.
[00:57:02.476 --> 00:57:13.422]  91%, new numbers just came out, it had been 89 a few years ago, 91% of people now live in the city and are almost completely unself-sufficient.
[00:57:13.422 --> 00:57:20.946]  And of the 9% in the country, half or less, so less than 5% of this country is self-sufficient.
[00:57:22.179 --> 00:57:24.640]  The globalists have us exactly where they want us.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:38.465]  They have us in a high-tech, domesticated world with a bunch of spoiled, rotten welfare people who've been sent through different prisons as they grew up, that love their thug, gangster culture, wearing their hoodies up over their heads and acting all tough.
[00:57:39.065 --> 00:57:51.514]  As the entire society and the resources are cut off artificially by the globalists to bring in a global meltdown so horrible that we'll beg for absolute tyranny to save us from it.
[00:57:51.514 --> 00:57:57.418]  Now I've told you over and over and over exactly what's going to happen.
[00:57:57.418 --> 00:57:59.299]  I told you where gold was going.
[00:57:59.299 --> 00:58:01.360]  I told you they're getting ready for new wars.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.942]  We're following a globalist handbook.
[00:58:03.942 --> 00:58:06.324]  It is a mayday situation!
[00:58:08.086 --> 00:58:22.796]  And the socialists, the socialists are going to point at all these people and say they're revolutionaries and they're great, and they're going to be used to menace what's left of the middle class to accept massive tax increases and more welfare.
[00:58:22.796 --> 00:58:30.061]  So more of the population as the economy crashes goes on welfare, so they can get rid of the middle class and only have the ultra-rich.
[00:58:30.061 --> 00:58:34.585]  And anytime people get uppity, they'll just turn a horde of zombie welfare people loose on you.
[00:58:35.461 --> 00:58:38.662]  Now, we're going to come right back after this one minute break.
[00:58:38.662 --> 00:58:44.305]  I'm giving the numbers out for Brits to call.
[00:58:44.305 --> 00:58:48.267]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.861]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:58.784]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.784 --> 00:59:01.346]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.346 --> 00:59:06.708]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.708 --> 00:59:09.770]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:11.811]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:18.315]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.315 --> 00:59:21.697]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.697 --> 00:59:27.481]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.481 --> 00:59:29.122]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.122 --> 00:59:30.423]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.423 --> 00:59:33.105]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.105 --> 00:59:37.327]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.327 --> 00:59:39.909]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.930]  End of America 3.com.
[00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:44.511]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:59:44.511 --> 00:59:48.393]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:48.393 --> 00:59:53.655]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:53.655 --> 00:59:56.036]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.036 --> 00:59:58.838]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.407 --> 01:00:10.251]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.251 --> 01:00:11.833]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:13.374]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.374 --> 01:00:17.578]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.578 --> 01:00:21.642]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.696 --> 01:00:33.159]  It's very elementary what's happened, and I really get frustrated when a lot of people don't even understand elementary things.
[01:00:33.159 --> 01:00:35.760]  I mean, do you hear what we talk about here every day?
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:39.961]  How we predicted all of this with total precision?
[01:00:39.961 --> 01:00:52.166]  They are turning loose the welfare, sports rioter, hooligan mobs all over the world, and allowing them to do whatever they want, so that the middle class will beg to have their rights taken away.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:01:00.025]  And all of this is being done while the global economy goes into a depression.
[01:01:00.025 --> 01:01:01.666]  And it's going to get worse.
[01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:12.436]  And they're letting the thugs riot first, so that when legitimate people come out and truly politically demonstrate, by then the public is going to accept rioters being shot on sight.
[01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:18.911]  These people aren't revolutionaries burning down family stores and homes and pulling people out of cars.
[01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:21.452]  They're scumbag criminal filth.
[01:01:21.452 --> 01:01:25.054]  And 99% of the emails I'm getting from England say you're absolutely right.
[01:01:25.054 --> 01:01:26.134]  I'm here taking care of my dad.
[01:01:26.134 --> 01:01:26.915]  He's had a heart attack.
[01:01:26.915 --> 01:01:28.095]  I'm in the south of London.
[01:01:28.095 --> 01:01:29.576]  I can see the fires outside.
[01:01:29.576 --> 01:01:31.197]  These people are absolute scum.
[01:01:31.197 --> 01:01:32.597]  They're not going after the government.
[01:01:32.597 --> 01:01:34.158]  They're going after the people.
[01:01:34.158 --> 01:01:35.859]  This is ridiculous!
[01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:39.821]  And now it's coming out they've been coordinated by government and media.
[01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:40.941]  Of course they have.
[01:01:40.941 --> 01:01:42.122]  It isn't going to stop with just the
[01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:44.799]  Police standing down.
[01:01:44.799 --> 01:01:52.889]  This is a total setup, and you're going to see all sorts of Soros-type operatives, globalist operatives, saying this is some type of American or English spring.
[01:01:52.889 --> 01:01:58.176]  And we're getting these same riots and racial attacks are going on as well all over the U.S., and that's being covered up.
[01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:00.851]  By the national news.
[01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:08.578]  I heard local radio this morning saying, you know, when a caller called in and said, you know, a lot of this is racial in the U.S., even though the mayor of Philadelphia said it, who's black.
[01:02:08.578 --> 01:02:11.000]  They said, how dare you say that, and hung up on him.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.383]  Just political correctness, total brainwashing.
[01:02:15.609 --> 01:02:17.712]  I'm going to get you on later in the show, Ted.
[01:02:17.712 --> 01:02:22.959]  I'm going to give the number out for folks to call in from England to give us their views, only from England.
[01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:29.727]  If you agree with this and think it's George Washington striking by pulling women out of cars, and you think it's wonderful, I'd like to hear from you.
[01:02:31.189 --> 01:02:32.310]  Understand what this is.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.971]  I'd like to hear from you as well.
[01:02:33.971 --> 01:02:34.031]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:34.111]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:34.191]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:37.493]  Just put your country code in or call on Skype if you want to hear from me in England.
[01:02:37.493 --> 01:02:37.553]  800-259-9231.
[01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:39.434]  Ted, I know you've been holding to get on.
[01:02:39.434 --> 01:02:42.897]  Just briefly, tell us what gold's doing today, what's happening with the stock markets.
[01:02:42.897 --> 01:02:45.558]  I know I've got a bunch of news on that I haven't even gotten into yet.
[01:02:57.403 --> 01:02:58.263]  Ted Anderson?
[01:02:58.263 --> 01:02:58.943]  Yeah, I'm right here.
[01:02:58.943 --> 01:03:01.824]  Gold hit $1,800 an ounce today.
[01:03:01.824 --> 01:03:05.065]  And right now, currently it's at $1,776.80.
[01:03:05.065 --> 01:03:07.526]  Silver's at $3,907.
[01:03:07.526 --> 01:03:12.627]  It's been just another, just a rocking day in the gold market.
[01:03:12.627 --> 01:03:14.628]  Stock market's down.
[01:03:14.628 --> 01:03:18.669]  Alex, it's just like things are melting down in Britain right now.
[01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:21.390]  The United States is just peeling apart.
[01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:25.371]  Everything is proceeding as the new world order has foreseen it.
[01:03:26.516 --> 01:03:28.518]  Well, I can just say this, Alex.
[01:03:28.518 --> 01:03:35.323]  I mean, really, people... I mean, that video, DVD offer, silver is the one that's climbing now, and it went up a couple bucks already.
[01:03:35.323 --> 01:03:41.769]  $83... $88 delivered, actually, for the video, the silver dollars.
[01:03:41.769 --> 01:03:43.170]  Take advantage of that.
[01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.571]  Get small pieces of gold.
[01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:47.153]  The francs right now are at $390 apiece.
[01:03:47.153 --> 01:03:48.995]  Buy them like you need them.
[01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:52.578]  You know, because later on, that's going to be what you're going to be trading for food.
[01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:54.440]  This paper currency's doomed.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:04.326]  I mean, just the whole pack... Ted, can you imagine what the hordes of thug, white, wannabe tough guys are going to do as things descend?
[01:04:04.326 --> 01:04:07.508]  I'm just glad I'm in Texas where we're not going to have a lot of problems with this.
[01:04:07.508 --> 01:04:10.350]  We're just going to have big piles of dead thugs.
[01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:11.671]  You know, that's the thing.
[01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:13.272]  I mean, the British people should be armed.
[01:04:13.272 --> 01:04:14.432]  There's no question about it.
[01:04:14.432 --> 01:04:15.213]  I think about that.
[01:04:15.213 --> 01:04:20.596]  I think, you know, this whole thing would be over right now if the people had a gun in every house.
[01:04:20.596 --> 01:04:21.497]  That's all it would take.
[01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:24.143]  You know, you would have law and order.
[01:04:24.143 --> 01:04:27.124]  You only have these riots in disarmed sectors of the world.
[01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:29.145]  We need to get an article out about that.
[01:04:29.145 --> 01:04:31.005]  I mean, that's the issue here.
[01:04:31.005 --> 01:04:38.368]  Folks want to call and ask about the radio specials, which again, Ted buys the gold when it's low, sells it to you when it's high at the old low price.
[01:04:39.088 --> 01:04:43.071]  They got a whole list of radio specials at the lower price, but it goes up every day.
[01:04:43.071 --> 01:04:43.131]  800-686-2237.
[01:04:43.131 --> 01:04:45.172]  800-686-237.
[01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:51.556]  Ted, I want to have you pop in with a full report later.
[01:04:51.556 --> 01:04:57.660]  I'm beside myself with anger right now, though, over what's happening in England and how so few really get it.
[01:05:00.925 --> 01:05:04.266]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.

[01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:05.659]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.659 --> 01:06:08.920]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.721]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:20.103]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.103 --> 01:06:22.344]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.884 --> 01:06:24.365]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:06:24.365 --> 01:06:25.646]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.646 --> 01:06:27.887]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.775 --> 01:06:49.059]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:06:49.059 --> 01:06:58.184]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:07:01.294 --> 01:07:03.016]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:03.016 --> 01:07:08.322]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:08.322 --> 01:07:09.844]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:09.844 --> 01:07:18.654]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:26.899]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:26.899 --> 01:07:34.904]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:34.904 --> 01:07:42.308]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:08:00.796 --> 01:08:06.218]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:08.499]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:13.581 --> 01:08:20.204]  Well, twelve years ago in England, the United States, Europe, they all started getting the riot police ready.
[01:08:20.204 --> 01:08:31.410]  We've covered the flash mob reports by the British Ministry of Defense four years ago, the Department of Defense three years ago, laying out how all this would happen and how a police state would be needed.
[01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:37.311]  And it'll be executed against the general population that's non-violent and non-criminal.
[01:08:37.311 --> 01:08:44.733]  That's why under this social engineering system, it is absolutely imperative that the general public be disarmed.
[01:08:44.733 --> 01:08:57.296]  Because you can't play the giant poor, welfare, disenfranchised, thug culture that's been popularized by MTV and made to be sexy.
[01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:06.213]  Off against the scared chicken-necked middle class if you don't have a scared chicken-necked middle class.
[01:09:06.213 --> 01:09:16.086]  And joining us is an American journalist who's lived in London for many years and he's done great reports for us from Copenhagen Summit and other events is Patrick Henningsen.
[01:09:16.927 --> 01:09:21.514]  And Max Keiser's coming up in about 30 minutes to give us his view on this.
[01:09:21.514 --> 01:09:24.238]  He scolded us in an email that we had it all wrong.
[01:09:24.238 --> 01:09:29.626]  This was a glorious liberation happening of the iPods and things.
[01:09:29.626 --> 01:09:32.490]  And I don't usually disagree with Keiser, but...
[01:09:33.671 --> 01:09:36.553]  But he'll straighten me out here in a moment.
[01:09:36.553 --> 01:09:39.115]  After all, I'm just a dumb American.
[01:09:39.115 --> 01:09:42.678]  Patrick Henningsen, you're an American over in London.
[01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:48.742]  You witnessed attacks, barricades, what appeared to be racial attacks.
[01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:50.163]  Obviously, most of this now is just
[01:09:50.623 --> 01:09:51.984]  General criminal looting.
[01:09:51.984 --> 01:09:55.905]  Can you give us the full spectrum analysis of exactly what's happening?
[01:09:55.905 --> 01:10:01.828]  Because this can't happen in a country, in a city, where the public is armed.
[01:10:01.828 --> 01:10:06.490]  This could only happen in places like Chicago, New York, or greater England.
[01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:10.092]  And of course we have the secret immigration program of Tony Blair.
[01:10:10.092 --> 01:10:13.994]  Now they've brought in the entitled groups.
[01:10:13.994 --> 01:10:17.095]  They have the disheveled, drunken British
[01:10:19.176 --> 01:10:23.038]  Yeah, thank you Alex, thanks.
[01:10:23.038 --> 01:10:41.688]  Yeah, listen, what you have here, what's been expressed in the last three or four days in this country is the culmination of a social experiment that's been going on, starting with Margaret Thatcher,
[01:10:42.307 --> 01:10:51.453]  Through ten years of Tony Blair government, and now obviously into the David Cameron's coalition, conservative liberal Democrat government.
[01:10:51.453 --> 01:10:52.694]  It's a social experiment.
[01:10:52.694 --> 01:10:53.955]  It's failed horribly.
[01:10:54.847 --> 01:11:12.735]  And I'll top it off with the point that I wanted to make yesterday, which I didn't make, was the government in this country have set their priorities over the last 10 years of bombing and pillaging innocent people in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, and most recently in Libya.
[01:11:13.779 --> 01:11:21.324]  With spending, you know, $800,000 per cruise missile, dropping 7,000 of those in the first week.
[01:11:21.324 --> 01:11:22.705]  That's where our money's going.
[01:11:22.705 --> 01:11:24.606]  That's where their priority is.
[01:11:24.606 --> 01:11:27.408]  And they've taken their eye off the ball in this country.
[01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:33.552]  And sadly, I could have told you this is coming a long time ago, and so could everybody else in my neighborhood.
[01:11:33.552 --> 01:11:37.154]  And anyone else who's lived in the city is particularly vulnerable.
[01:11:37.774 --> 01:11:41.656]  To the sort of escalation that we've seen in the last 72 hours.
[01:11:41.656 --> 01:11:46.279]  You know, you've got young kids who have had their culture imported from America.
[01:11:46.279 --> 01:11:58.606]  What's meaningful for British young kids between the age of 12 and 18, American baseball caps, Nike trainers, track suits, hip-hop, Snoop Doggy Dogg.
[01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:00.567]  This is a culture which isn't even British.
[01:12:01.227 --> 01:12:02.648]  It's a cheap American import.
[01:12:20.715 --> 01:12:21.175]  I don't know.
[01:12:41.467 --> 01:12:44.150]  Not firefighters that go into burning buildings.
[01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:52.577]  It is now the lowest of the low, common denominator bling, garbage, psychic warfare, evil for the young girls.
[01:12:52.577 --> 01:13:01.845]  It's cut yourself, take drugs, Lady Gaga with dead Chinese political dissidents hanging on meat hooks at her events, everyone worshiping it.
[01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:04.247]  Just a total culture of flooded death.
[01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:08.814]  With just zombie-like creatures running around in all directions.
[01:13:08.814 --> 01:13:13.503]  This is a genius psychic warhead that they've launched into us with precision.
[01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:24.594]  From an objective point of view, you can say very safely that in this country, and in America it's the same, you have millions of disaffected youth.
[01:13:24.594 --> 01:13:25.554]  They have no vision.
[01:13:25.554 --> 01:13:31.696]  They have no opportunity, because all the jobs have been exported to the Far East and elsewhere.
[01:13:31.696 --> 01:13:33.176]  They have essentially no future.
[01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:35.957]  All they have is this cheap import culture.
[01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:37.477]  They have brands.
[01:13:37.477 --> 01:13:39.338]  They have brands they can look up to.
[01:13:39.338 --> 01:13:43.179]  They have music artists who are way overpaid, footballers,
[01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.320]  That's it.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.141]  That's all they get.
[01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:53.866]  So these retail riots, the mainstream media are saying that, oh, this is because of austerity cuts and social services have been cut.
[01:13:53.866 --> 01:13:57.289]  But you know why this has kicked off into commercial riots?
[01:13:57.289 --> 01:13:58.930]  It's not because of the government.
[01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:01.632]  The state hasn't necessarily failed these people.
[01:14:01.632 --> 01:14:04.694]  It's because the cheap credit was cut off three years ago.
[01:14:05.254 --> 01:14:09.237]  And I don't know if Max Keiser will touch on this point, but it's not about the state.
[01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:12.740]  Who ultimately controls the prosperity is the banks.
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.721]  They cut credit.
[01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:15.782]  They cut cheap access to easy money.
[01:14:15.782 --> 01:14:17.604]  The second and third mortgages are gone.
[01:14:17.604 --> 01:14:20.266]  That was the spending money that parents were giving the kids.
[01:14:20.266 --> 01:14:24.509]  The holiday loan, the car loan, the loan for the computer.
[01:14:24.509 --> 01:14:27.551]  Pay for your living room furniture three years from now.
[01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:29.973]  No, they are totally desperate
[01:14:31.496 --> 01:14:35.177]  To obtain, not a mate, not a job, not a future.
[01:14:35.177 --> 01:14:37.538]  They should be fighting the government politically.
[01:14:37.538 --> 01:14:41.779]  They must attain the iPhone, the iPad, the boombox.
[01:14:41.779 --> 01:14:43.479]  They must attain it.
[01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.860]  That's what they're looting, that's what they're robbing.
[01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:50.481]  The liquor, the electronics, they're leaving the bookstores alone.
[01:14:50.481 --> 01:14:53.802]  And they're pulling people out of their cars, they're carjacking people.
[01:14:53.802 --> 01:14:59.044]  Now we have the deaths of vigilantes, run over, trying to defend their businesses.
[01:14:59.944 --> 01:15:03.385]  But here's the bigger issue, Patrick.
[01:15:03.385 --> 01:15:06.025]  The police now have admitted they were ordered to stand down.
[01:15:06.025 --> 01:15:09.226]  And Cameron's letting this get worse and worse and worse.
[01:15:09.226 --> 01:15:28.229]  So they can then bring in, starting tomorrow, all perfectly timed, he didn't call back Parliament on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday, he called it on Tuesday back for Thursday, at its height, with more burning and nothing being done, they will come in and pass totally draconian laws that will restrict the general public's rights
[01:15:28.849 --> 01:15:36.742]  Ahead of true austerity and crackdowns and they will probably go ahead and say we're gonna start shooting to kill anybody who politically protest.
[01:15:38.848 --> 01:15:50.892]  For the first time on British mainland, this is not counting Northern Ireland, they're now authorizing that the police can have rubber bullets or sort of plastic bullets in their rounds and they will shoot losers on sight.
[01:15:50.892 --> 01:15:54.673]  This is something that is, it's the first time in history on the British mainland.
[01:15:54.673 --> 01:15:56.113]  This is normal in Belfast.
[01:15:56.113 --> 01:16:00.795]  Of course, if you live in Belfast, and I've spoke to Northern Irish people and they're just kind of shaking their heads like,
[01:16:01.235 --> 01:16:12.132]  Because if this happened in Belfast, basically, water cannons would be out, they would just be spraying these kids all over the street, plastic bullets would be shot, and you can disperse crowds quite quickly.
[01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:16.939]  It's a fine line to walk between law and order and the security police state.
[01:16:17.419 --> 01:16:21.742]  Normally we'd have this debate 15 years ago, and it'd be a totally different discussion.
[01:16:21.742 --> 01:16:26.185]  But now the police state has moved so far forward into people's lives.
[01:16:26.185 --> 01:16:30.708]  The state has moved so far forward into people's lives that this is a natural progression.
[01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:39.094]  For people who are anarchists, for people who say they were doing this for freedom and against the establishment, they've just kicked the ball into their own goal.
[01:16:39.574 --> 01:16:42.195]  Because the state will clamp down on Twitter.
[01:16:42.195 --> 01:16:44.535]  They'll be tracing IP addresses.
[01:16:44.535 --> 01:16:48.416]  They'll be listening more to your cell phone.
[01:16:48.416 --> 01:16:50.397]  Your privacy is gone.
[01:16:50.397 --> 01:16:51.437]  Cops on the street.
[01:16:51.437 --> 01:16:53.398]  Maybe soldiers on the street in some cities.
[01:16:53.398 --> 01:16:56.939]  And the root of this is first they had to disarm the Brits.
[01:16:57.959 --> 01:17:02.223]  And once they've disarmed a population in Chicago and New York, it's always the same.
[01:17:02.223 --> 01:17:03.904]  The criminals all move there.
[01:17:03.904 --> 01:17:05.946]  The welfare people all move there.
[01:17:05.946 --> 01:17:09.709]  And then a hell is created, and it's total divide and conquer.
[01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:12.171]  And that's the issue.
[01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:17.675]  You know, we can't write an article about, hey, it's wrong to say, shoot arsonist, and then not add to the equation.
[01:17:18.638 --> 01:17:25.663]  This has all been allowed because the public can't defend themselves, and the police stood down and let it get to this point.
[01:17:25.663 --> 01:17:27.345]  People do have a right.
[01:17:27.345 --> 01:17:35.511]  I mean, if you were inside that pub barricaded in Sunday night, and they were trying to set fire to you inside of it, you would be insane to not go out and defend yourself.
[01:17:35.511 --> 01:17:39.794]  But in this gelded, castrated world, that is the ultimate crime.
[01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:42.434]  Yeah, that's what we've come to.
[01:17:42.434 --> 01:17:45.817]  People are waiting for the state to come and sort it out.
[01:17:45.817 --> 01:17:47.919]  People are saying, oh the police, are they going to be there?
[01:17:47.919 --> 01:17:49.060]  Are the police going to be there?
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:53.484]  Listen, if this goes down again, I'm talking to my neighbors.
[01:17:53.484 --> 01:17:55.185]  We're going to exchange phone numbers.
[01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:55.966]  We're going to have a list.
[01:17:56.426 --> 01:18:00.527]  And by the way, as you restore order, they will send the cops and tell you you can't do it.
[01:18:22.273 --> 01:18:37.065]  The Prime Minister would save a whole lot of money and a whole lot of resources if you let communities self-organize a little bit, but what that will be, that's forbidden because that's basically saying you're no longer dependent on the state.
[01:18:37.065 --> 01:18:42.649]  You're no longer dependent on all the massive multi-million dollar contracts, CCTV cameras.
[01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:44.110]  It's a giant industry.
[01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:45.031]  The winner out of this
[01:18:46.552 --> 01:18:46.933]  Yeah.
[01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:12.551]  They'll have everything in place and the public behind, not allowing any type of demonstration because, oh, we saw the riots of August of 2011.
[01:19:12.551 --> 01:19:16.452]  This is the preparatory phase ahead of a total clampdown.
[01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:20.975]  These people are not revolutionaries, they're idiot criminals that want iPads.
[01:19:20.975 --> 01:19:26.457]  If they were real freedom fighters, they would have gone into the armories, they would have gone after the government.
[01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:27.718]  And I'm not calling for that either.
[01:19:28.098 --> 01:19:33.527]  But the point is, a real revolution like 1776 goes at the government.
[01:19:33.527 --> 01:19:37.634]  At the government and would run that Queen and Cameron out of the country.
[01:19:37.634 --> 01:19:39.738]  This is not a real revolution.
[01:19:39.738 --> 01:19:41.260]  Do you agree, Patrick Henningsen?
[01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:43.078]  I agree completely.
[01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.681]  I spent time on the street in the last couple of days.
[01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:47.963]  I made a point to go out and speak to somebody.
[01:19:47.963 --> 01:19:48.464]  Stay there.
[01:19:48.464 --> 01:19:49.145]  Stay there with us.
[01:19:49.145 --> 01:19:51.888]  I've got callers from England I've got to get to.
[01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:53.589]  But I'm going to start going to them and get your comments.
[01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:55.291]  But I want you to finish that statement.
[01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:59.015]  All the callers from England, we're going to get to you after this quick break.
[01:19:59.015 --> 01:20:00.597]  Tony O, Steve, Patrick, Matthew.

[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.301]  Why Ali-C?
[01:20:07.301 --> 01:20:10.862]  Because it helps your body fight viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
[01:20:10.862 --> 01:20:18.546]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:20:18.906 --> 01:20:24.489]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[01:20:24.489 --> 01:20:29.712]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:20:29.712 --> 01:20:33.414]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[01:20:33.414 --> 01:20:39.558]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:20:39.858 --> 01:20:44.663]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ali-C.

[01:22:56.354 --> 01:22:57.855]  Question.
[01:22:57.855 --> 01:23:04.517]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:10.902]  Author Jose Calazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[01:23:10.902 --> 01:23:16.427]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazo has been trying to prove that the U.S.
[01:23:16.427 --> 01:23:21.532]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology.
[01:23:21.832 --> 01:23:28.316]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[01:23:28.316 --> 01:23:35.100]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:36.680]  Who has access to it?
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.121]  How is it being used?
[01:23:38.121 --> 01:23:41.423]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[01:23:41.423 --> 01:23:48.127]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.
[01:23:48.527 --> 01:23:53.815]  Available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com.
[01:23:53.815 --> 01:23:55.898]  America's New Slavery.
[01:23:55.898 --> 01:23:58.061]  All Americans should be concerned.
[01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:35.176]  Okay, Max Keiser's coming up, and I'm going to have these folks from England give them their perspective on what's going on there.
[01:24:35.176 --> 01:24:36.177]  Is this a revolution?
[01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:47.146]  Or is this a bunch of people using this as an excuse to rob and loot and steal and carjack people and run over folks trying to protect their businesses and kill three of them?
[01:24:47.146 --> 01:24:47.867]  That's confirmed.
[01:24:47.867 --> 01:24:49.467]  People are dying.
[01:24:49.467 --> 01:24:54.930]  And you see, this is more like a wild French revolution where we just rape, steal, kill, do whatever you want.
[01:24:55.510 --> 01:25:03.322]  I don't want any part of that so-called revolution led by a bunch of 16-year-old zit-faced wannabe scum.
[01:25:03.322 --> 01:25:07.127]  I'm so angry right now, folks, I can barely even contain myself here on air.
[01:25:07.127 --> 01:25:10.292]  Because we called that all of this was coming with total precision.
[01:25:11.351 --> 01:25:12.532]  We knew what was coming.
[01:25:12.532 --> 01:25:13.832]  We broke it down.
[01:25:13.832 --> 01:25:16.494]  And now we're watching it unfold.
[01:25:16.494 --> 01:25:20.035]  And Patrick Henningsen, living in southern London, he gets it.
[01:25:20.035 --> 01:25:20.956]  He witnessed it.
[01:25:20.956 --> 01:25:22.637]  He knows what it is.
[01:25:22.637 --> 01:25:25.998]  But some people are just like, total police state, kill everybody.
[01:25:25.998 --> 01:25:26.639]  They don't get it.
[01:25:27.239 --> 01:25:30.701]  There's other people on the other end saying these are great freedom fighters.
[01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:32.862]  Let them do whatever they want.
[01:25:32.862 --> 01:25:34.283]  Let them burn down family homes.
[01:25:34.283 --> 01:25:35.724]  It's beautiful.
[01:25:35.724 --> 01:25:41.668]  And then you've got other people that are just scared when this couldn't happen if the Brits were armed.
[01:25:41.668 --> 01:25:46.311]  Now, you said, Patrick, you're going out in the streets and that you had a message for people.
[01:25:46.311 --> 01:25:46.651]  Go ahead.
[01:25:48.114 --> 01:25:52.177]  You know, the best time is when this is fresh, like after any event.
[01:25:52.177 --> 01:25:54.038]  You go out and you speak to people on the streets.
[01:25:54.038 --> 01:25:58.981]  In this case, I spoke to some young people and some older people in the community and I got mixed messages.
[01:25:58.981 --> 01:26:04.926]  One of the things I heard over and over again from some of the kids was like, we brought the police force to their knees.
[01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.447]  We did it and we showed them.
[01:26:06.447 --> 01:26:10.009]  And I'm saying to them, and I'm saying to them, show them what?
[01:26:10.009 --> 01:26:11.310]  You've hit the wrong target.
[01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:14.052]  If you really, really had something revolutionary,
[01:26:14.492 --> 01:26:24.155]  To express here, you would hit the banks, you would hit the news corporation, you would hit the evening standards of the propaganda, and the banking establishment, the Bank of England.
[01:26:24.155 --> 01:26:26.215]  That's the heart of the establishment.
[01:26:26.215 --> 01:26:29.376]  If you really want to rock the establishment, hit the right targets.
[01:26:29.376 --> 01:26:30.897]  They're not hitting the right targets.
[01:26:30.897 --> 01:26:34.758]  But this whole thing, there is evidence that this is engineered.
[01:26:34.758 --> 01:26:41.179]  There's a fine little corrupt dance between private security companies, the police force, and organized crime.
[01:26:41.179 --> 01:26:42.920]  They all link in a business triangle.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.281]  I don't know.
[01:26:53.895 --> 01:26:58.258]  But it's like the ATF caught shipping cocaine and guns now.
[01:26:58.258 --> 01:27:04.182]  It's always been the police with select crime gangs and the private security forces.
[01:27:04.182 --> 01:27:06.584]  That's where the 500 billion a year in drug money in the U.S.
[01:27:06.584 --> 01:27:06.884]  goes.
[01:27:06.884 --> 01:27:08.245]  Of course it's system run.
[01:27:08.245 --> 01:27:13.609]  And it's now coming out that sharp-dressed men were coordinating all of this from the beginning.
[01:27:13.609 --> 01:27:15.550]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:17.132]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:27:17.132 --> 01:27:21.074]  And the police admitting the stand-down right there, there's the proof.
[01:27:21.074 --> 01:27:23.076]  This is pointed at hard-working Brits.
[01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:27.912]  Look, there's also another big, massive danger here.
[01:27:27.912 --> 01:27:32.236]  In the reordering after this, the next phase, I predict, will be racial tension.
[01:27:32.236 --> 01:27:37.340]  This will spill over between Indian, Pakistani, black and white communities.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:46.066]  And now you will see, whenever there's an economic depression in Europe, there's always the rise of right-wing, extreme right-wing groups.
[01:27:46.066 --> 01:27:51.630]  Fascists, British National Party, UKIP, they will have a bigger seat at the table now.
[01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:52.371]  Anders Breivik,
[01:27:52.771 --> 01:27:53.411]  Quicker than that!
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:27.645]  You're going to see the rise of right-wing extremists and these kind of splinter groups like you did in the 70s.
[01:28:27.645 --> 01:28:50.060]  So that's kind of frightening for me because basically they're going to have a bigger voice at the table and they're being used and they're infiltrated by the alphabet soup agencies as bad as any groups and I don't see anything positive coming out of what we've seen here in England which is total anarchy in the last three, four decades.
[01:28:51.661 --> 01:28:56.083]  Well, I totally agree with you and this whole thing is scripted.
[01:28:56.083 --> 01:29:01.066]  They need to have everybody clashing with each other while the megabanks rob everybody.
[01:29:01.066 --> 01:29:08.751]  And if this is the vanguard of the revolutionaries going after family homes and fourth and fifth generation family shops,
[01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:13.793]  Boy, heaven help us, and that's exactly what the social engineers are going to do.
[01:29:13.793 --> 01:29:21.097]  They're going to play the giant underclass off against the middle class, and then the government will play the part of the arbiter, the referee.
[01:29:21.097 --> 01:29:30.001]  This is the divide and conquer strategy that we literally beat to death here on Earth, here on the air.
[01:29:30.001 --> 01:29:34.103]  Patrick Henningsen, 21stCenturyWire.com.
[01:29:34.103 --> 01:29:37.064]  We look forward to speaking to you more in the future.
[01:29:37.064 --> 01:29:37.785]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:38.812 --> 01:29:39.913]  Thanks Alex for having me on.
[01:29:39.913 --> 01:29:40.713]  I appreciate it.
[01:29:40.713 --> 01:29:41.514]  Thank you.
[01:29:41.514 --> 01:29:47.617]  Max Keiser coming up and I promise Tony, Steve, Patrick, Matthew, I'm going to get to you quickly with Keiser.
[01:29:47.617 --> 01:29:48.698]  You can give him your view.
[01:29:48.698 --> 01:29:51.220]  I don't know what your view is, but you can give it to him.
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.620]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:55.142]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.142 --> 01:29:57.844]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.711 --> 01:30:05.254]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.254 --> 01:30:06.174]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.174 --> 01:30:09.597]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.597 --> 01:30:10.457]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.457 --> 01:30:15.340]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:16.101]  It's true.
[01:30:16.101 --> 01:30:20.964]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.964 --> 01:30:21.784]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.784 --> 01:30:25.387]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.387 --> 01:30:29.069]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.269 --> 01:30:30.070]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:32.833]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:36.517]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.517 --> 01:30:37.318]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.318 --> 01:30:41.463]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.463 --> 01:30:46.228]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:04.429 --> 01:32:05.690]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:09.573]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.573 --> 01:32:11.855]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:11.855 --> 01:32:17.260]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:24.387]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.387 --> 01:32:30.394]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.394 --> 01:32:34.018]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.538 --> 01:32:38.839]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[01:32:48.343 --> 01:32:50.303]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.303 --> 01:32:51.444]  It's here.

[01:33:04.699 --> 01:33:06.362]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:06.362 --> 01:33:07.764]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:07.764 --> 01:33:09.027]  You want answers?
[01:33:09.027 --> 01:33:11.110]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:14.997]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:24.571 --> 01:33:27.273]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[01:33:27.273 --> 01:33:30.254]  I go to court when I have to?
[01:33:30.254 --> 01:33:34.357]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[01:33:34.357 --> 01:33:36.758]  Got nothing better to do?
[01:33:36.758 --> 01:33:40.680]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:43.722]  What do you think I'm broke?
[01:33:43.722 --> 01:33:44.443]  Huh?
[01:33:44.443 --> 01:33:48.425]  Yeah, there's a new way.
[01:33:48.425 --> 01:33:49.966]  I'll be the first in line.
[01:33:49.966 --> 01:33:53.428]  But it better work this time.
[01:33:55.874 --> 01:33:57.336]  Yeah, peace sells.
[01:33:57.336 --> 01:34:03.002]  Al Gore called for an Arab Spring in the United States last week.
[01:34:03.002 --> 01:34:07.928]  And CNBC, his trusted folks, are saying this is because of austerity.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:31.865]  And I'm sure that has something to do with it, but the larger issue is the rise of football hooligalism, where you, that's a nice word I just invented, where all over the world, in Brazil, in the US, in South Africa, Boston, Vancouver, rioting, burning, carjacking, when the team wins or loses.
[01:34:32.725 --> 01:34:35.907]  Now, would we say these are young revolutionaries?
[01:34:35.907 --> 01:34:42.610]  You know, I thought revolutionaries went into government armories and got guns and tried to storm the Parliament.
[01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:45.111]  In the French Revolution, they stormed the Bastille.
[01:34:45.111 --> 01:34:47.012]  Our founding fathers here in the U.S.
[01:34:47.012 --> 01:34:50.694]  went up against the British military.
[01:34:50.694 --> 01:34:55.977]  But some are saying that this is the vanguard of a political uprising.
[01:34:57.549 --> 01:35:24.617]  And if it is, I can't say I'm part of this, that I support this type of political movement by young welfare recipients predominantly against, well, family dwellings on fire, women jumping out of them, fourth and fifth generation clothing stores, watch stores, also don't forget evil shoe stores.
[01:35:26.492 --> 01:35:27.993]  I can't say that.
[01:35:27.993 --> 01:35:29.174]  I see that as the enemy.
[01:35:29.174 --> 01:35:44.461]  You know, the police now admit today, that's in mainstream news, they were ordered to stand down, and it's also being reported all over England that youths were offered money to start riots by people claiming to be part of the media.
[01:35:44.461 --> 01:35:54.546]  And so it gets started, and then the government can pass, notice they're waiting four days to let things really get out of control before the parliament comes back in tomorrow.
[01:35:55.825 --> 01:35:57.727]  Specially called.
[01:35:57.727 --> 01:36:06.153]  And then of course they'll pass draconian laws, curfews on everyone, TSA-style checkpoints, and then everyone will lose their liberties.
[01:36:06.153 --> 01:36:08.034]  And that's how it always works.
[01:36:08.034 --> 01:36:09.396]  I've seen this over and over again.
[01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:11.977]  And it's very, very dangerous.
[01:36:11.977 --> 01:36:14.760]  Yes, I do support getting rid of these corrupt governments.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:20.364]  And, you know, we had an article that was linked all over the web just on Monday.
[01:36:20.364 --> 01:36:20.944]  Pollsters!
[01:36:20.944 --> 01:36:22.426]  Americans are pre-revolutionary!
[01:36:23.228 --> 01:36:33.753]  And so the system all over the world is letting these out-of-control welfare riots, iPod riots happen, ahead of putting in draconian rules against everybody.
[01:36:33.753 --> 01:36:36.774]  And I've predicted this ad nauseum like a broken record.
[01:36:36.774 --> 01:36:39.415]  And Rasmussen is finding the U.S.
[01:36:39.415 --> 01:36:40.836]  is pre-revolutionary.
[01:36:40.836 --> 01:36:46.918]  I just hope that the revolution isn't targeting shoe stores.
[01:36:46.918 --> 01:36:49.920]  Because, and of course I really don't want to have things be violent, but
[01:36:51.158 --> 01:37:04.527]  I mean, if they are going to be violent, this isn't going to hurt the establishment to have family dwellings being burned and women jumping out of them, or people being carjacked, which we've confirmed from reporters that have witnessed it and it's been videotaped on the ground.
[01:37:04.527 --> 01:37:16.855]  But joining us is reporter for, I don't know, RT, Greek TV, British TV, talk show host, you name it, needs no introduction, Max Keiser of the Keiser Report.
[01:37:16.855 --> 01:37:18.796]  And Max, what's your view on this?
[01:37:18.796 --> 01:37:20.858]  Is this thuggery or glorious revolution?
[01:37:22.278 --> 01:37:31.400]  Well, I mean, I see a connection, obviously, with what I've been calling the global insurrection against banker occupation.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:38.282]  Every city in different countries is going through this in different ways.
[01:37:38.282 --> 01:37:48.184]  So, London is going through it differently than Athens or Tunis or Madrid or Dublin or even Madison, Wisconsin.
[01:37:49.674 --> 01:38:07.151]  But when you have a society that valorizes looting, and this is covered actually in a book by Frédéric Bastiat in 1850, who said, this is post-French Revolution, he explains that when the privileged classes use the government for legalized plunder,
[01:38:08.027 --> 01:38:12.831]  That you encourage the lower classes to revolt using plunder.
[01:38:12.831 --> 01:38:19.856]  So what's happening in London is, on one hand, they're plundering, or you could say they're trying to get a job at Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[01:38:19.856 --> 01:38:23.619]  Morgan, because they are mimicking their overlords.
[01:38:23.619 --> 01:38:28.443]  They are mimicking what they see happening in their society.
[01:38:28.443 --> 01:38:35.748]  Why isn't Jamie Dimon, and why aren't they now trying to recruit these kids to be part of their bank?
[01:38:35.748 --> 01:38:37.670]  Because they're setting the example.
[01:38:38.166 --> 01:38:39.687]  Okay, well, Max, hold on a second.
[01:38:39.687 --> 01:38:42.688]  I thought I was going to disagree with you, but I actually totally agree.
[01:38:42.688 --> 01:38:48.710]  When you sent us an email saying, hey, Alex, you don't quite get it, you know, now I do actually get it.
[01:38:48.710 --> 01:38:50.110]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:57.693]  When we have giant prison populations and young people are thrown into them for almost no reason, they become part of the criminal culture.
[01:38:57.693 --> 01:39:01.254]  And they see that the mega banks don't get in trouble.
[01:39:01.254 --> 01:39:02.695]  They see that there's no rule of law.
[01:39:03.815 --> 01:39:12.459]  They see that the Formula One owner all over the world gets his racetracks paid for with taxpayer money, not just tax incentives, but actually gets paid.
[01:39:12.459 --> 01:39:25.145]  When they see his daughter getting a $4 billion gift from him, when they see trillions being stolen, when they see all of this happening, then they say, hey, this is a criminal society, let's go for it.
[01:39:25.145 --> 01:39:28.227]  So if you're saying it from that perspective, I do agree with you.
[01:39:28.227 --> 01:39:30.288]  My only issue is they're going to use this now
[01:39:30.928 --> 01:39:34.509]  That's coming anyway.
[01:39:34.509 --> 01:39:54.276]  Because of this tension that's going on, this war, the war that I see, and I've been talking about it for 10 years, between the speculators who want interest rates at zero and people who have jobs and want to save money who want interest rates higher.
[01:39:54.276 --> 01:39:55.557]  Now what did Ben Bernanke just say?
[01:39:55.557 --> 01:39:59.438]  He said he's going to keep interest rates near zero for another two years.
[01:40:00.118 --> 01:40:02.119]  This is plunder.
[01:40:02.119 --> 01:40:03.939]  This is unconscionable.
[01:40:03.939 --> 01:40:07.660]  This is causing enormous financial dislocation.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:10.141]  It's a form of financial oppression.
[01:40:10.141 --> 01:40:14.022]  And I would go so far as to call it financial apartheid.
[01:40:14.022 --> 01:40:22.884]  Because in America, if you're part of the underclass, for example, they use interest rates to create the new Jim Crow laws or financial apartheid.
[01:40:22.884 --> 01:40:26.045]  If you're part of the elite, you get to borrow money at negative 2%.
[01:40:27.465 --> 01:40:35.589]  If you're borrowing money in a credit card or a payday loan, you're borrowing money at 35 or 40 percent or higher, guaranteed to impoverish you.
[01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:39.892]  So they use interest rates like they used to use those Jim Crow laws.
[01:40:39.892 --> 01:40:50.617]  Or as you see in South Africa during the apartheid regime, they're creating through financial apartheid a permanent underclass and keeping interest rates at zero percent
[01:40:50.697 --> 01:40:50.757]  Yes.
[01:41:20.817 --> 01:41:23.461]  That train has left the station, Alex.
[01:41:23.461 --> 01:41:27.086]  Nothing is going to stop that.
[01:41:27.086 --> 01:41:36.658]  And so you've got these uprisings... Max, I agree with you, but let me tell you, you're not going to see stuff like that here in Austin, Texas because the people have a right...
[01:41:37.199 --> 01:41:37.379]  I don't
[01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:05.394]  Not rubber bullets, but with leaden full metal jacket bullets instantly.
[01:42:05.394 --> 01:42:13.643]  So that's all you need to know right there is that they've been allowed to do this because the social engineers think they're going to get major power out of it.
[01:42:13.643 --> 01:42:18.548]  But let's look at what's happening to the global markets when you are breaking down the interest rates.
[01:42:19.288 --> 01:42:22.971]  Obviously that signifies they're going to continue to devalue the dollar.
[01:42:22.971 --> 01:42:34.078]  We saw over the weekend Greenspan tell Meet the Prestitutes on Meet the Press that indeed they'll just print money to pay off the debt.
[01:42:34.078 --> 01:42:36.280]  Well, that signifies hyperinflation.
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.923]  So where are we going, Max Keiser, from your research?
[01:42:40.923 --> 01:42:48.688]  I mean, is the acceleration towards worldwide financial collapse accelerating or where are we on the chart?
[01:42:49.288 --> 01:42:50.690]  I'll tell you where exactly we're going.
[01:42:50.690 --> 01:42:54.375]  We're going towards something called negative interest rates.
[01:42:54.375 --> 01:43:04.667]  The Swiss are now charging people to keep money at their bank, and a bank in America is now charging their highest deposit customers
[01:43:05.308 --> 01:43:06.469]  We're good to go.
[01:43:29.046 --> 01:43:29.267]  I don't
[01:43:48.746 --> 01:44:00.361]  On top of it, I mean, this is absolute war against everyone but the big six megabanks who literally get the tens of trillions of taxpayer bailout money to themselves and then hoard it.
[01:44:00.361 --> 01:44:02.824]  I mean, this is an economic global takeover.
[01:44:02.824 --> 01:44:03.886]  How do we counter them, Max?
[01:44:06.067 --> 01:44:15.131]  The people who have seen the writing on the wall, the people on your show, Gerald Cilente, Peter Schiff, Mark Faubourg, Max Keiser, get on the list.
[01:44:15.131 --> 01:44:16.432]  What have we been saying?
[01:44:16.432 --> 01:44:25.996]  Gold is the only non-corruptible form of money, and of course it's breaking out, hitting new all-time highs as we speak, and that is going to continue.
[01:44:25.996 --> 01:44:35.480]  It's actually melting up at this point, because the realization that these types of uprisings that you're seeing around the world, including London, they're just going to spread.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:36.440]  We're good to go.
[01:45:02.008 --> 01:45:05.209]  In a different way, just like it's happened differently in all these other countries.
[01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:07.810]  But it's a global insurrection.
[01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:09.770]  They're a part of that global insurrection.
[01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:19.633]  I know that in the UK and the BBC and these other UK press outlets that they are loathe to refer to it as having any political component whatsoever.
[01:45:19.633 --> 01:45:21.074]  But that is to be blind.
[01:45:21.454 --> 01:45:22.015]  We're good to go.
[01:45:41.176 --> 01:45:41.537]  I think so.
[01:45:57.154 --> 01:45:59.775]  We're all together now because the global banking cartel has
[01:46:31.869 --> 01:46:32.309]  No, I'm not.
[01:46:32.309 --> 01:46:33.429]  I'm on my landline.
[01:46:33.429 --> 01:46:35.810]  I don't know why it's degenerating.
[01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:36.270]  I don't know.
[01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:37.450]  Does it sound any better?
[01:47:04.069 --> 01:47:05.230]  It's just kind of watery.
[01:47:05.230 --> 01:47:07.352]  We'll call the cell phone during the break.
[01:47:07.352 --> 01:47:08.853]  I just really want to hear what you have to say.
[01:47:08.853 --> 01:47:11.315]  Well, Max, where does it go?
[01:47:11.315 --> 01:47:20.982]  Because the banks give themselves trillions in interest-free or negative money, then for everybody who isn't being given the free money, it destroys those of us that work for it.
[01:47:21.983 --> 01:47:38.417]  Obviously premeditatedly done this they built a giant police state in place to protect this conversion from a free market society to a crony insider monopoly system and they're getting ready their new wars.
[01:47:38.417 --> 01:47:45.163]  What do you make of S&P who certified all the derivatives garbage for the banks knowingly paid by them
[01:47:45.643 --> 01:47:55.806]  Coming in and getting rid of the AAA rating of the US, the states now having their ratings lowered, the counties, the cities, all to the very zombie banks.
[01:47:55.806 --> 01:48:06.790]  Our ratings are cut to them who are the most insolvent, most fraudulent out there, as the only sector in the economy that's doing well is the insiders, the General Electric's
[01:48:07.450 --> 01:48:09.773]  Uh, who are exempt from the laws they get passed.
[01:48:09.773 --> 01:48:13.257]  The megabanks who are exempt from the laws they get passed.
[01:48:13.257 --> 01:48:15.480]  I mean, how long can this go on?
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.104]  Or is it too sophisticated for the fluoride head population?
[01:48:19.104 --> 01:48:19.765]  Are we doomed?
[01:48:21.041 --> 01:48:26.265]  The Wall Street is always looking for new sources of revenue, and we understand that.
[01:48:26.265 --> 01:48:35.030]  They created Subprime, which is toxic waste paper to make oodles of money off of fraud, and then they blew that market up.
[01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:37.292]  They're always looking for new ways.
[01:48:37.292 --> 01:48:39.453]  What they figured out is that the U.S.
[01:48:39.453 --> 01:48:50.741]  Treasury bond market, which is AAA, is huge, but you can't make a lot of money on it because it's AAA, and the spreads and the liquidity and the volatility is very low.
[01:48:51.361 --> 01:48:52.241]  We're good to go.
[01:49:11.368 --> 01:49:12.289]  We're good to go.
[01:49:33.107 --> 01:49:34.168]  And that's because the insiders...
[01:49:47.861 --> 01:49:48.561]  Well, that's it.
[01:49:48.561 --> 01:49:49.982]  And plus, they're the insiders.
[01:49:49.982 --> 01:49:56.026]  It's come out reportedly that somebody made an $80 million bet that's made them $10 billion.
[01:49:56.026 --> 01:50:01.969]  Somebody knew that the debt rating was going to be lowered a month ago, and the Daily Mail and others think it's Lord Soros.
[01:50:01.969 --> 01:50:10.914]  But the point is, imagine for all these big insiders who have all the insider information on the schizophrenic helter-skelter rising and falling
[01:50:11.634 --> 01:50:15.777]  That we've seen on the stock markets in the last few days.
[01:50:15.777 --> 01:50:20.920]  Just imagine the wealth that they're creating in this process of command destruction.
[01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.963]  Now, Max, hopefully we can keep you a little bit in the next hour.
[01:50:23.963 --> 01:50:26.965]  We're going to try your cell phone back here in just a moment.
[01:50:26.965 --> 01:50:30.467]  I know you're over in France, so sometimes the connections aren't that good.
[01:50:30.467 --> 01:50:38.693]  But I promise to get the Tony, Steve, Patrick, Matthew and others from England to get their views on the riots and what's happening there.
[01:50:38.693 --> 01:50:40.294]  But just like Katrina, folks,
[01:50:40.894 --> 01:50:44.137]  They didn't come for five, six days to help with water and food.
[01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:45.999]  They left folks in the Superdome.
[01:50:45.999 --> 01:50:50.864]  They went to the richest areas to basically loot the homes, steal the firearms.
[01:50:50.864 --> 01:50:52.165]  The government did.
[01:50:52.165 --> 01:50:55.369]  And so know this, the government works for the bankers.
[01:50:55.369 --> 01:50:57.211]  They are not going to help you.
[01:50:57.811 --> 01:51:01.074]  So get your gold, get your guns, get your silver.

[01:51:27.676 --> 01:51:31.899]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:31.899 --> 01:51:36.462]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:36.462 --> 01:51:42.286]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:51:42.286 --> 01:51:45.668]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:51:45.908 --> 01:51:48.630]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:48.630 --> 01:51:53.693]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:52:34.557 --> 01:52:34.977]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:00.572 --> 01:53:04.095]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[01:53:04.095 --> 01:53:10.121]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[01:53:10.121 --> 01:53:10.781]  Why?

[01:54:01.035 --> 01:54:02.296]  We've got it.
[01:54:02.296 --> 01:54:06.897]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:54:06.897 --> 01:54:08.538]  Alright, you wanna go?
[01:54:13.596 --> 01:54:17.137]  All right, we're... Had Kaiser on a better phone line and it dropped.
[01:54:17.137 --> 01:54:19.718]  But we've got him back now.
[01:54:19.718 --> 01:54:21.638]  Look, I understand Max's frustration.
[01:54:21.638 --> 01:54:22.719]  I've got it.
[01:54:22.719 --> 01:54:24.359]  I'm gonna be honest with you.
[01:54:24.359 --> 01:54:27.960]  I am beside myself with anger right now.
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:31.021]  Because everything we predicted is happening.
[01:54:31.021 --> 01:54:32.642]  I'm very upset gold hit $1,800 today.
[01:54:35.129 --> 01:54:42.051]  I'm very upset they announced they're going to keep interest rates at zero, which means negative for the big banks.
[01:54:42.051 --> 01:54:44.271]  That means total dollar devaluation.
[01:54:44.271 --> 01:54:47.672]  I mean, this country is going to be a hellhole.
[01:54:47.672 --> 01:54:49.673]  This is all by design.
[01:54:49.673 --> 01:54:51.193]  And I know Max is trying to stop it.
[01:54:51.193 --> 01:54:52.794]  I'm trying to stop it.
[01:54:52.794 --> 01:54:59.575]  And I even get Max's point, even if they're burning down houses and stuff, and they are thugs, at least they're doing something.
[01:55:02.216 --> 01:55:08.158]  At least the action shows there's some life left there and that people are angry and maybe it'll lead to something.
[01:55:08.158 --> 01:55:10.218]  I mean, I get it.
[01:55:10.218 --> 01:55:15.420]  I just see the government manipulating it, disarming the public to allow this to happen.
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:20.821]  And it just shows me how diabolical it is to have social engineers running things and
[01:55:22.685 --> 01:55:29.849]  It's so sophisticated that, and it's also so simple at the same time, how do you get the general public to figure this out?
[01:55:29.849 --> 01:55:42.416]  Now, I haven't asked if Max can stay a little bit into the next hour because I want to get more into the economy with him and all his predictions that unfortunately have come true, almost every one of them, and where things are going and how folks can protect themselves.
[01:55:42.416 --> 01:55:45.398]  But I've got to get to Tony O, Steve Patrick and Matthew from the UK.
[01:55:45.398 --> 01:55:48.460]  They've been holding for about 30, 40 minutes.
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:51.762]  Kaiser, will you hold 15, 20 minutes with us into the next hour?
[01:55:52.594 --> 01:55:54.795]  Okay, okay fantastic.
[01:55:54.795 --> 01:55:58.976]  Let's go to Tony Owen England back to the riots.
[01:55:58.976 --> 01:56:01.836]  What's your view on what's happening over there?
[01:56:01.836 --> 01:56:02.857]  Hi Alex.
[01:56:02.857 --> 01:56:04.917]  Yes, it's not revolution.
[01:56:04.917 --> 01:56:08.878]  It might have started off as a possible beginning of revolution.
[01:56:08.878 --> 01:56:12.639]  Well the police as you know have operated a stand-down operation.
[01:56:12.639 --> 01:56:16.160]  Basically it's turned into opportunistic criminality and violence.
[01:56:16.584 --> 01:56:35.022]  Well the powers that be will not let this opportunity go to waste and on Thursday we will see, as a good word you use, more draconian laws and a complete evisceration of what rights we think we have left after our Terrorist Act 1 and 2, your equivalent of the Patriot Act 1 and 2 were put in place.
[01:56:35.022 --> 01:56:36.264]  It's going downhill rapidly Alex.
[01:56:37.130 --> 01:56:41.153]  Yeah, I've seen the video of them dragging folks out of cars, burning down houses.
[01:56:41.153 --> 01:56:45.437]  At every instinctive level, I want to go get in the street and attack those people.
[01:56:45.437 --> 01:56:48.319]  And then I hear folks saying, well, that's vigilantism.
[01:56:48.319 --> 01:56:57.386]  When the police don't protect you, it's not bad to instinctively, when marauding men are running around burning things and attacking people, to want to attack them.
[01:56:57.386 --> 01:57:00.769]  And I'm not taking sides here.
[01:57:00.769 --> 01:57:05.453]  The social engineers have been caught now allowing this to get out of control.
[01:57:06.073 --> 01:57:10.797]  And again, I want to ask the question, why aren't the looters going after the government?
[01:57:10.797 --> 01:57:15.760]  Because if they go after government buildings, they're going to get shot deader than a hammer.
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:17.601]  Anything else you want to add, Tonio?
[01:57:17.601 --> 01:57:18.282]  Very eloquent.
[01:57:18.282 --> 01:57:20.363]  Yeah, just one more point.
[01:57:20.363 --> 01:57:25.147]  This is the opportunity to show the world what the word anarchy really means.
[01:57:25.147 --> 01:57:28.910]  Society standing together for each other.
[01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:31.351]  But one final point why you've got Max on.
[01:57:31.351 --> 01:57:34.814]  Could Max please enlighten me why silver hasn't moved in relation to gold?
[01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:38.624]  Recently.
[01:57:38.624 --> 01:57:38.825]  Max?
[01:57:40.666 --> 01:57:46.448]  Yeah, well, these two have been moving in relation to each other for 10 years.
[01:57:46.448 --> 01:57:51.889]  They've been both averaging between 21 and 22 percent gains per year for 10 years.
[01:57:51.889 --> 01:57:55.790]  Silver is up over 30 percent this year.
[01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:57.931]  Gold is up again this year.
[01:57:57.931 --> 01:58:00.952]  There is a relationship that's gone back for 10 years.
[01:58:00.952 --> 01:58:07.914]  If you look at any one or two month period of time, you can see a divergence, but of course, that would be foolish.
[01:58:08.274 --> 01:58:23.384]  You need to look at it at least over a one year period of time and this is kind of a short-sightedness that we see operating in these riots in London because people are looking at this what happened in one night or two night and drawing conclusions from it and they're failing to look at the historical and global
[01:58:23.784 --> 01:58:30.306]  I'm trying to bring in some context here of a historic and global nature.
[01:58:30.306 --> 01:58:31.266]  No, stay there.
[01:58:31.266 --> 01:58:32.927]  We gotta go to break, but I agree with you.
[01:58:32.927 --> 01:58:39.569]  Now that I see your perspective, and yes, to the caller, you're looking at a snapshot of gold and silver, not a ten-year or one-year graph.
[01:58:39.569 --> 01:58:42.490]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:46.171]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.171 --> 01:58:48.052]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:59:37.626 --> 01:59:38.847]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.663 --> 02:00:10.504]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.504 --> 02:00:12.085]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.085 --> 02:00:13.625]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.625 --> 02:00:17.826]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.826 --> 02:00:21.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:38.041]  All right, Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com is our guest for another 30 minutes.
[02:00:38.041 --> 02:00:40.802]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:00:40.802 --> 02:00:49.524]  I want to hold Max over, and he's agreed to, to really detail what's happening in the command destruction global banker occupation and the resistance to it.
[02:00:49.524 --> 02:00:54.985]  I want to get into why zero interest rates or negative interest rates are so destructive
[02:00:56.025 --> 02:00:59.546]  And I also want to get into his future perspective on the economy.
[02:00:59.546 --> 02:01:00.286]  I agree with him.
[02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:01.867]  There is world revolution.
[02:01:01.867 --> 02:01:04.987]  And a lot of times you'll see it.
[02:01:04.987 --> 02:01:13.390]  You know, the first tremors of it with the under disadvantaged class that will strike out in ways that are that are counterproductive.
[02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:14.890]  But he's saying it's an indicator.
[02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:17.791]  Of things to come and I agree with him on that.
[02:01:17.791 --> 02:01:22.413]  So we'll be looking at that coming up after I get to Steve, Patrick, Matthew and others.
[02:01:22.413 --> 02:01:24.494]  Steve in the UK, then Patrick and Matthew.
[02:01:24.494 --> 02:01:29.656]  Steve, what's your view on what's happening over in the UK now into day four?
[02:01:29.656 --> 02:01:31.357]  Oh hi Alex, hi Max.
[02:01:31.357 --> 02:01:37.619]  I just want to get the point across that this is not global insurrection against bank and occupation.
[02:01:37.619 --> 02:01:42.481]  These guys who are doing the looting, are doing the thieving, are playing thugs.
[02:01:42.481 --> 02:01:44.182]  That's all they are Alex, the thugs.
[02:01:45.177 --> 02:01:49.901]  What they're doing is, the government are front-running this violence.
[02:01:49.901 --> 02:01:52.023]  Like they front-run the stocks.
[02:01:52.023 --> 02:01:53.825]  Like they front-run everything else.
[02:01:53.825 --> 02:01:56.086]  They're front-loading, exactly as I said.
[02:01:56.086 --> 02:01:58.729]  They are allowing this to happen.
[02:01:58.729 --> 02:02:00.370]  They could trigger at any time.
[02:02:00.370 --> 02:02:04.594]  They control the gang member leaders, like the ATF controls the cocaine and guns.
[02:02:04.594 --> 02:02:05.755]  They've been caught publicly.
[02:02:05.755 --> 02:02:10.399]  They allow it to happen, front-running, knowing resistance coming.
[02:02:10.399 --> 02:02:11.580]  Now they've branded it.
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:12.881]  Well, it only is, Alex.
[02:02:12.881 --> 02:02:15.784]  I mean, I slightly agree with Mark because people are feeling it, Alex.
[02:02:15.784 --> 02:02:17.485]  People are really feeling the austerity.
[02:02:35.191 --> 02:02:39.434]  Well, I think Max is being, is giving them far too much credibility.
[02:02:39.434 --> 02:02:41.355]  I spoke to these people on the street.
[02:02:41.355 --> 02:02:49.280]  They don't know, they don't know the intricacies of the banks, what the banks are doing.
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:54.903]  All they can see is they're paying more, they're getting less money, and basically they're getting screwed.
[02:02:54.903 --> 02:02:56.664]  And that's what they're fighting against.
[02:02:56.664 --> 02:02:59.506]  And the bankers are going to misdirect them right into our
[02:03:01.971 --> 02:03:10.534]  Yeah, they're going out on the street and they're saying, right, we're going to take now, we're going to take whatever we want, we're just going to seize, we're going to loot, we're going to burn.
[02:03:10.534 --> 02:03:12.014]  And that's their answer.
[02:03:12.014 --> 02:03:13.014]  It's nothing.
[02:03:13.014 --> 02:03:15.415]  They don't realise what the banks have done to us.
[02:03:15.415 --> 02:03:18.036]  All they can see is the effect of it.
[02:03:18.656 --> 02:03:20.758]  All right, well said, Max.
[02:03:20.758 --> 02:03:22.119]  Do you see his perspective?
[02:03:22.119 --> 02:03:31.165]  I know you say the police state train already left the station, but by the police standing down and allowing this, and then the media, that's the real kicker.
[02:03:31.165 --> 02:03:34.267]  They're branding it as political when it's not.
[02:03:34.267 --> 02:03:39.731]  Then they're now front-loading, as the caller said, and demonizing legitimate rebellion to tyranny.
[02:03:40.615 --> 02:03:49.682]  Well, to say that the folks on the street riding don't know the intricacies of the banking system, it reminds me of that Bob Dylan line.
[02:03:49.682 --> 02:03:53.384]  You don't have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
[02:03:53.384 --> 02:04:02.391]  In other words, three years ago, the UK bailed out these banks, and to pay for the bailout, they imposed draconian austerity measures.
[02:04:03.494 --> 02:04:10.216]  As night follows day, when you confiscate wealth from a whole class of people, you can expect riots.
[02:04:10.216 --> 02:04:12.157]  This crime was committed three years ago.
[02:04:12.157 --> 02:04:21.199]  The crimes we're seeing in the last three days are the symptoms, the effects of the major crime of three years ago that was never prosecuted.
[02:04:21.199 --> 02:04:23.400]  Prosecute the original crime!
[02:04:23.860 --> 02:04:25.620]  I agree, I agree, I agree.
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.201]  Prosecute Barclays Bank.
[02:04:27.201 --> 02:04:30.822]  Prosecute Fred the Shred over at Royal Bank of Scotland.
[02:04:30.822 --> 02:04:33.942]  Prosecute the real criminals three years ago.
[02:04:33.942 --> 02:04:35.383]  They've never been prosecuted.
[02:04:35.383 --> 02:04:43.285]  To point the finger at now a few kids burning a few buildings, of course it's going to happen if you destroy their society and steal all their wealth.
[02:04:43.285 --> 02:04:44.545]  This is exactly what's going to happen.
[02:04:44.545 --> 02:04:48.146]  I know, I know, but see the genius of them triggering it like
[02:04:49.614 --> 02:04:55.196]  An oil field expert using dynamite to blow out an oil well that's on fire.
[02:04:55.196 --> 02:04:59.217]  You can see how they then use the crisis they create to get even more power.
[02:04:59.217 --> 02:05:00.978]  Patrick and Matthew, straight ahead.
[02:05:00.978 --> 02:05:02.158]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:02.158 --> 02:05:08.280]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:09.080]  Yes.
[02:05:09.080 --> 02:05:11.622]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.622 --> 02:05:17.007]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:17.007 --> 02:05:20.050]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:20.050 --> 02:05:22.372]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.372 --> 02:05:28.617]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.617 --> 02:05:31.800]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:37.764]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:37.764 --> 02:05:39.405]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.405 --> 02:05:40.706]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:40.706 --> 02:05:43.388]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.388 --> 02:05:47.611]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:47.611 --> 02:05:52.234]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:05:52.234 --> 02:05:54.836]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:05:54.836 --> 02:05:58.699]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[02:05:58.699 --> 02:05:59.699]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[02:06:01.914 --> 02:06:06.595]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:06:06.595 --> 02:06:13.037]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:06:13.037 --> 02:06:15.317]  Number one, study the past.
[02:06:15.317 --> 02:06:17.698]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:06:17.698 --> 02:06:21.419]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:06:22.563 --> 02:06:25.645]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:06:25.645 --> 02:06:29.487]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[02:06:29.487 --> 02:06:38.552]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:06:38.552 --> 02:06:41.954]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:06:41.954 --> 02:06:45.597]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:46.437 --> 02:06:51.365]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:06:51.365 --> 02:06:55.991]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:06:55.991 --> 02:06:58.695]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:01.405 --> 02:07:05.429]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.429 --> 02:07:08.672]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.672 --> 02:07:13.476]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:07:13.476 --> 02:07:19.862]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:19.862 --> 02:07:22.105]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.645 --> 02:07:23.105]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.105 --> 02:07:23.446]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.446 --> 02:07:24.246]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:24.246 --> 02:07:25.407]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.407 --> 02:07:27.648]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.536 --> 02:07:43.677]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.677 --> 02:07:48.819]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:48.819 --> 02:08:02.124]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:02.124 --> 02:08:07.706]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:21.399 --> 02:08:28.623]  By the way, 7 o'clock tonight, PrisonPlanet.tv, another InfoWars special report with Max Keiser.
[02:08:28.623 --> 02:08:34.806]  So after the markets have closed, after we know more, we'll have Max Keiser back with us tonight, just like Gerald Cilente last week.
[02:08:34.806 --> 02:08:36.707]  I've already done one special report.
[02:08:36.707 --> 02:08:43.030]  We're doing a eugenics special report, an extended report tomorrow night at 7pm at PrisonPlanet.tv with Aaron Dykes.
[02:08:43.970 --> 02:08:50.214]  Ahead of the weeknight, 7 o'clock, 30-minute news show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:50.214 --> 02:08:53.195]  Then we're going to launch a new site that's mainly just a news site.
[02:08:53.195 --> 02:08:55.637]  It'll have all the PrisonPlanet.tv stuff on it.
[02:08:55.637 --> 02:08:58.918]  And we've got a lot of little networks and TV systems that want to pick it up.
[02:08:58.918 --> 02:09:01.380]  So, very excited about that.
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:03.721]  Going back to callers from England with Max Keiser.
[02:09:03.721 --> 02:09:04.822]  Then I'm going to get into the economy.
[02:09:05.622 --> 02:09:08.184]  That Max again has really called what was going to happen.
[02:09:08.184 --> 02:09:10.126]  Three years ago, banker bailout.
[02:09:10.126 --> 02:09:13.769]  He said two or three years from now, the austerity measures will start kicking in.
[02:09:13.769 --> 02:09:14.750]  The stimulus will end.
[02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:16.972]  You're going to see him hold the interest rates.
[02:09:16.972 --> 02:09:18.993]  You're going to see him totally rape the public.
[02:09:18.993 --> 02:09:22.957]  You're going to see gold up to $2,000 by the end of the year.
[02:09:22.957 --> 02:09:24.698]  He was saying that at the start of the year.
[02:09:24.698 --> 02:09:32.224]  Now JPMorgan Chase came out yesterday and said $2,500 an ounce by December or higher.
[02:09:32.224 --> 02:09:33.906]  And that's the insiders telling you that.
[02:09:34.606 --> 02:09:43.769]  Uh, so, uh, we'll be talking about that in a moment, but right now, Patrick in England, your view on the, uh, hooligans.
[02:09:43.769 --> 02:09:55.192]  I mean, for me, it's, it's, it's, it's really just the same type sports fans we see rioting in LA, Chicago, New York, uh, Brazil, South Africa, black, white, doesn't matter.
[02:09:55.192 --> 02:09:59.334]  All the same disgusting, weird, thuggish sports culture.
[02:09:59.334 --> 02:09:59.374]  Um,
[02:10:00.894 --> 02:10:11.617]  That we just see all over the place really expanding where men's manhood now is all about how spindly-necked and thug-like they are.
[02:10:11.617 --> 02:10:14.438]  But what's your view on it?
[02:10:14.438 --> 02:10:14.978]  Hello, Alex.
[02:10:14.978 --> 02:10:16.438]  Just a quick mention.
[02:10:16.438 --> 02:10:19.039]  Thank you for all your information that you're getting out to the public.
[02:10:20.845 --> 02:10:26.628]  In England, there's a wide sort of spectrum of people that do understand what's going on.
[02:10:26.628 --> 02:10:28.909]  But it is the bankers that have orchestrated this.
[02:10:28.909 --> 02:10:30.790]  It's very obvious.
[02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:33.551]  Not to the thugs on the streets, which I obviously totally condone.
[02:10:34.170 --> 02:10:55.117]  But one thing that people may not be aware of, on Saturday night after the initial peaceful protest in London outside the police station, there was a theatre nearby that was actually showing a show that night, by coincidence, of people being trapped in a theatre because there was riots going on outside.
[02:10:55.117 --> 02:10:57.018]  I mean, this woman from New York
[02:10:57.618 --> 02:11:14.968]  She was involved with a theatre, she came on either Sky News or BBC, I forget which one, and said, wow, what a coincidence, and we know that the globalists like to take the mickey out of the people like that, but I totally condemn the violence and the destruction that's going on, but it's just a strange coincidence, I'd like your thoughts on that.
[02:11:15.208 --> 02:11:22.636]  Well, we know they ran drills with the exact same targets being hit at the exact same time on 7-7, also 9-11.
[02:11:22.636 --> 02:11:33.308]  But if you go to PrisonPlanet.com, we've got multiple reporters on the ground in England, including Patrick Henningsen who's been reporting for us, but Steve Watson in London, Paul Watson north of London.
[02:11:33.308 --> 02:11:35.550]  Police were ordered to stand down as London burned.
[02:11:36.751 --> 02:11:43.815]  Continuing, we are the Enfield Army, video of locals chasing rioters in London.
[02:11:43.815 --> 02:11:47.157]  So folks are definitely, and that will short-circuit the globalists.
[02:11:47.157 --> 02:11:52.160]  If citizens start standing up against the looters, the globalists aren't going to be able to fully use this.
[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:56.203]  In fact, look for government to try to block the citizens next from defending themselves.
[02:11:56.203 --> 02:12:01.606]  We've seen England, we've seen the UK arrest people who've defended themselves in their own homes.
[02:12:01.606 --> 02:12:04.308]  Stocks tumble open amid economic fears.
[02:12:05.428 --> 02:12:14.038]  Continuing, there's reports that youths were offered money to start the riots.
[02:12:14.038 --> 02:12:17.763]  So that's some of the reports we've got there.
[02:12:17.763 --> 02:12:19.164]  But that's my take on it.
[02:12:19.164 --> 02:12:20.406]  What's your take, Max Keiser?
[02:12:21.257 --> 02:12:23.119]  These people have been financially oppressed.
[02:12:23.119 --> 02:12:25.422]  This is financial apartheid.
[02:12:25.422 --> 02:12:28.987]  And they have had their financial rights deprived from them.
[02:12:28.987 --> 02:12:32.251]  Somebody needs to communicate with these people.
[02:12:32.251 --> 02:12:33.913]  And to reach out to these people.
[02:12:33.913 --> 02:12:37.598]  Because they have a right to grieve for grievance.
[02:12:38.098 --> 02:12:45.922]  They've been basically put into a prison of financial tyranny, effectively, and it's like a prison riot.
[02:12:45.922 --> 02:12:56.187]  Because it's completely, again, using the apartheid example, you know, we need like a Nelson Mandela type figure to stand up for the rights of these financially oppressed.
[02:12:56.187 --> 02:13:01.769]  They go to the machine to get money, to get ten quid, ten pounds, they're charged one pound.
[02:13:01.769 --> 02:13:02.990]  That's unconscionable.
[02:13:03.810 --> 02:13:14.038]  But Max, look, it'd be one thing if they went at the Parliament, or if they went at one of the palaces, or when Brits spontaneously attacked Camilla and Charles.
[02:13:14.038 --> 02:13:15.759]  There are proper fees in the UK now.
[02:13:15.759 --> 02:13:17.520]  Nobody can afford a proper education.
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:19.041]  Nobody can afford proper food.
[02:13:19.041 --> 02:13:20.202]  They're all being medicated.
[02:13:20.202 --> 02:13:21.563]  They're all being oppressed.
[02:13:21.563 --> 02:13:25.486]  And, you know, we're arguing about they're not eloquent enough in their speech for their rights.
[02:13:25.486 --> 02:13:27.067]  Well, they need representation.
[02:13:27.067 --> 02:13:28.247]  We need to represent them.
[02:13:29.128 --> 02:13:30.910]  I don't think so.
[02:13:47.944 --> 02:13:57.675]  That a lot of these people are still getting their free housing, their welfare checks, they just can't buy enough iPods, and they're looting stores for iPods and burning down family businesses.
[02:13:57.675 --> 02:14:01.600]  What about the victims of their attacks, Max?
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:02.401]  That's my issue.
[02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:04.162]  They're all victims.
[02:14:04.162 --> 02:14:11.446]  The people who are on both sides of this flaming riot are the victims of the looters in the city of London.
[02:14:11.446 --> 02:14:14.327]  And these people are being financially oppressed.
[02:14:14.327 --> 02:14:16.269]  Let me ask this, Max.
[02:14:16.269 --> 02:14:21.091]  What would have happened if the looters would have gone down to 10 Downing Street?
[02:14:21.091 --> 02:14:23.793]  Do you think there would have been some real bullets being fired at them back?
[02:14:25.504 --> 02:14:36.219]  They don't have enough of wherewithal or self-awareness to pick through the proper actions to get their grievances heard.
[02:14:36.219 --> 02:14:38.922]  That's why we need to help them represent themselves.
[02:14:38.922 --> 02:14:42.767]  I don't know, the starving Sir French knew where the government buildings were?
[02:14:44.528 --> 02:14:45.328]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:14:45.328 --> 02:14:47.950]  And it was all started by the same, for the same reason.
[02:14:47.950 --> 02:14:54.393]  The French introduced the affidavit, which is a currency of the period, backed by collateralizing church property.
[02:14:54.393 --> 02:14:58.275]  The exact same scam that we saw in the UK and America today.
[02:14:58.275 --> 02:15:01.296]  Collateralizing mortgages and creating a currency around that.
[02:15:01.296 --> 02:15:02.677]  And it bankrupted the country.
[02:15:03.137 --> 02:15:04.859]  Well here's what I want.
[02:15:21.437 --> 02:15:22.177]  I agree with you, but...
[02:15:38.283 --> 02:15:44.388]  At the same time, we should be able to then say, this is not the way to do a revolution.
[02:15:44.388 --> 02:15:50.412]  We need to go with the 1776 model that I know that you admire.
[02:15:50.412 --> 02:15:52.934]  And so we need to push worldwide 1776, not worldwide 1789 French Revolution.
[02:15:58.652 --> 02:16:02.774]  Nobody is pushing anybody out of the banks, currently.
[02:16:02.774 --> 02:16:03.154]  Okay?
[02:16:03.154 --> 02:16:04.295]  You're not doing it.
[02:16:04.295 --> 02:16:05.315]  I'm not doing it.
[02:16:05.315 --> 02:16:06.296]  Nobody's doing it.
[02:16:06.296 --> 02:16:08.237]  Obama's not doing it.
[02:16:08.237 --> 02:16:09.878]  David Cameron's not doing it.
[02:16:09.878 --> 02:16:12.939]  Nobody's pushing the corrupt bankers out of their offices today.
[02:16:12.939 --> 02:16:13.860]  Nobody.
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:14.400]  Okay?
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:16.421]  And the result is riots.
[02:16:16.421 --> 02:16:22.044]  And until you get rid of the corrupt, plundering class in the city of London, expect more riots.
[02:16:22.044 --> 02:16:22.985]  That's the recipe.
[02:16:22.985 --> 02:16:25.266]  Now Iceland can take over the banks!
[02:16:25.746 --> 02:16:31.290]  Iceland did take over the banks though, so maybe it should be a 1776 Icelandic model.
[02:16:31.290 --> 02:16:33.732]  Iceland is a sterling example.
[02:16:33.732 --> 02:16:38.295]  They pushed back against the banks, and they prosecuted, and they're trying to prosecute bankers.
[02:16:38.295 --> 02:16:42.298]  Guess where those bankers went for safe harbor, Alex, who escaped Iceland?
[02:16:42.298 --> 02:16:43.159]  They went to London.
[02:16:45.859 --> 02:16:47.680]  No, that's where all the Russian oligarchs went.
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:47.900]  I agree.
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:53.982]  By the way, did you know in the last two years almost all of the Israeli oligarchs have fled to the City of London within London?
[02:17:15.871 --> 02:17:19.693]  Right, now tell me about the riots in Brixton.
[02:17:19.693 --> 02:17:21.293]  Of course the people are rioting!
[02:17:21.293 --> 02:17:23.054]  Because their country is a sham!
[02:17:23.054 --> 02:17:26.636]  It's a shameful, despotic, cesspool of money laundering!
[02:17:26.636 --> 02:17:29.517]  Max, listen, if you think... Hey!
[02:17:29.517 --> 02:17:33.559]  Why don't you go to Brixton and lead them against the City of London?
[02:17:33.559 --> 02:17:35.800]  I'll guarantee you... I was in Cairo!
[02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:36.820]  I was in Beirut!
[02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:37.921]  I was just in New York!
[02:17:37.921 --> 02:17:38.981]  That's why I said that!
[02:17:38.981 --> 02:17:40.061]  I've been on the front lines!
[02:17:40.061 --> 02:17:41.402]  You're incredible!
[02:17:41.402 --> 02:17:43.043]  I mean, you are George Washington!
[02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:48.318]  George, George Washington, you're not listening to me, George Kaiser.
[02:17:48.318 --> 02:17:51.199]  I know that you thought that was sarcastic.
[02:17:51.199 --> 02:17:56.241]  I'm saying, I mean, you're saying nobody's leading the charge.
[02:17:56.241 --> 02:17:57.942]  I'm not saying you should.
[02:17:57.942 --> 02:18:02.504]  I'm saying it sounds like you're about to, are you going to lead us, George?
[02:18:03.254 --> 02:18:16.777]  Look, the scariest thing for the British parliamentary system, the politicians in Britain today, would be if there's a sudden groundswell of people saying, these rioters have rights, you're infringing on their rights, they're not the problem, you're the problem.
[02:18:16.777 --> 02:18:19.838]  And then they go down and they say, we represent the rioters.
[02:18:19.838 --> 02:18:28.680]  They really can't articulate the problem because you've dumbed them down and medicated them so badly in the Department of Education and turned them into basically intellectual eunuchs.
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:31.381]  We're here to represent them because you screwed them.
[02:18:31.861 --> 02:18:35.324]  That's what the people calling into your show today should be worried about and talking about.
[02:18:35.324 --> 02:18:41.288]  Not condemning the brothers and sisters across the street who have been slaughtered by financial apartheid.
[02:18:41.288 --> 02:18:43.550]  They should be going down the hall and representing them for their rights.
[02:18:43.550 --> 02:18:44.591]  Look, it's more sophisticated than that.
[02:18:44.591 --> 02:18:46.552]  George, George, hold on.
[02:18:46.552 --> 02:18:48.493]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[02:18:48.493 --> 02:18:59.962]  We recognize that they have helped trigger this to then demonize the legitimate rebellion against the City of London that the globalists and their actuaries know is coming, just like our report.
[02:19:00.202 --> 02:19:01.043]  It's here!
[02:19:01.043 --> 02:19:01.903]  Alex, it's here!
[02:19:01.903 --> 02:19:03.304]  It's not coming, it's here!
[02:19:03.304 --> 02:19:10.629]  It's here in cities all over the world, and it's growing every single day, and it's one big global insurrection, and it's happening in cities everywhere.
[02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:11.790]  You know what?
[02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:18.335]  Okay, so somebody's gonna come burn my house, or burn our studios, instead of going after the City of London?
[02:19:18.335 --> 02:19:19.375]  I mean, I'm just saying that's wrong.
[02:19:21.485 --> 02:19:29.391]  Yeah, but if nobody puts a line in the sand against the bankers, you and me and everyone else are going to be gobbled up by this inferno.
[02:19:29.391 --> 02:19:30.271]  Alright, we're going to break.
[02:19:30.271 --> 02:19:32.573]  I think you've hit the nail on the head here, though.
[02:19:32.573 --> 02:19:34.395]  I think you really have crystallized it.
[02:19:34.395 --> 02:19:41.800]  The bankers' plan is to implode society and set off shore while they do it, then come in and buy everything that pays on the dollar.
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:43.121]  It's either the bankers or us.
[02:19:43.121 --> 02:19:48.045]  We must get the fractional reserve, fraudulent debt money system out of here.
[02:19:48.045 --> 02:19:49.846]  We must go back to constitutional money.
[02:19:50.427 --> 02:19:53.230]  Or we are facing a road warrior scenario.
[02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:55.513]  And I totally agree with Max on that front.
[02:19:55.513 --> 02:19:58.877]  I've got to get into the economy with him as well.
[02:19:58.877 --> 02:20:01.381]  And I want to go to more callers in England straight ahead.
[02:20:02.597 --> 02:20:04.439]  Hey Bill, pick up line 3, it's Brian.
[02:20:04.439 --> 02:20:06.120]  Hey Brian, what's up?
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:06.861]  Thanks.
[02:20:06.861 --> 02:20:12.286]  Hey Bill, I just received my shipment of the Safety Net, our full-year emergency food system.
[02:20:12.286 --> 02:20:20.173]  I can't tell you how great it feels to personally not have to worry anymore, especially with the growing threats to our everyday food supply.
[02:20:20.353 --> 02:20:30.421]  Brian, not only are you getting 4,320 nutritionally dense, delicious food servings, but the individual serving price is just $1.43 per meal.
[02:20:30.421 --> 02:20:33.304]  It's truly great tasting food at amazing prices.
[02:20:33.304 --> 02:20:35.826]  The variety is also a huge bonus bill.
[02:20:35.826 --> 02:20:39.188]  It's like having access to a full menu of impressive food.
[02:20:39.188 --> 02:20:44.573]  Well, it really is a safety net for those worried about the coming food shortages and how their families can prepare.
[02:20:44.873 --> 02:20:49.275]  It's great knowing I'm covered for the future, but I gotta go, Bill, and get all this food unloaded.
[02:20:49.275 --> 02:20:51.416]  With scorching heat devastating U.S.

[02:21:30.498 --> 02:21:39.824]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:21:39.824 --> 02:21:40.625]  This capitalism?
[02:21:40.625 --> 02:21:46.909]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:21:46.909 --> 02:21:47.710]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[02:22:53.889 --> 02:22:56.069]  From the shattered Rust Belt come the Lost Vegas.
[02:23:18.603 --> 02:23:24.289]  I just came to watch my LED.
[02:23:24.289 --> 02:23:25.931]  Life Before the Collapse.
[02:23:25.931 --> 02:23:29.154]  Final LP by The Lost Vegas.
[02:23:29.154 --> 02:23:30.615]  Drinking too much coffee.
[02:23:30.615 --> 02:23:33.418]  I'm needing a shave somewhere.
[02:23:39.238 --> 02:23:52.833]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[02:23:52.833 --> 02:23:58.499]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas now available at Amazon.com
[02:24:07.669 --> 02:24:34.627]  I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well, I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
[02:24:40.443 --> 02:24:44.929]  Alright, Matthew and Ian in England, we're going to leave it at that.
[02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:47.012]  When calls from England, we'll take more tomorrow.
[02:24:47.012 --> 02:24:54.481]  Max is going to stay a little bit later in the hour now because I really want to pick his brain on where he sees future trends going.
[02:24:55.302 --> 02:25:17.570]  But as Max keeps saying, and as I've been saying, and every other analyst we have on, this global banking cartel system is designed as a financial black hole to not create an economy or a society, to not empower through a credit system, but through a negative credit system that destroys everything in its path.
[02:25:17.570 --> 02:25:20.431]  And we're now entering the endgame phase.
[02:25:20.431 --> 02:25:23.172]  When I'm sitting around at night with my wife going to sleep at midnight,
[02:25:23.732 --> 02:25:27.393]  I mean, I'm holding her hand and we are literally praying to God.
[02:25:27.393 --> 02:25:29.893]  Because I understand how dangerous this is.
[02:25:29.893 --> 02:25:44.576]  A depression now, a global collapse now, a sustained global collapse with the way the public is today, decadent, doesn't know how to grow tomatoes, nothing, is going to be hellish.
[02:25:44.576 --> 02:25:46.336]  And it's still not too late to turn it around.
[02:25:46.336 --> 02:25:48.716]  We'll talk about that with Max Keiser in the next segment.
[02:25:48.716 --> 02:25:51.217]  In the short segment, Matthew and Ian
[02:25:53.239 --> 02:25:55.422]  Matthew just hung up as I was going to him.
[02:25:55.422 --> 02:25:56.263]  Ian in England.
[02:25:56.263 --> 02:25:57.905]  Ian, you're on the air.
[02:25:57.905 --> 02:25:59.808]  Any questions or comments for Kaiser?
[02:25:59.808 --> 02:26:02.672]  Or what's your take on the situation going on in your country?
[02:26:04.273 --> 02:26:07.895]  Hi Alex, just wanted to say hi to everybody in America and around the world.
[02:26:07.895 --> 02:26:12.157]  Just wanted to give you an update on what's really going on in London here.
[02:26:12.157 --> 02:26:13.637]  It's calmed down.
[02:26:13.637 --> 02:26:16.399]  I was driving around today in the city.
[02:26:16.399 --> 02:26:19.660]  I'm a plumber and I'm just cruising around.
[02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:22.201]  Lots of police, heavy police presence.
[02:26:22.201 --> 02:26:26.023]  It definitely looks like it's going into the police space.
[02:26:28.266 --> 02:26:30.226]  Other than that, you know, things have calmed down.
[02:26:30.226 --> 02:26:31.907]  People are as busy as usual.
[02:26:31.907 --> 02:26:39.248]  Yesterday, I must say, you know, there was a lot of hype around it in Central London.
[02:26:39.248 --> 02:26:40.768]  A lot of rumours flying around.
[02:26:40.768 --> 02:26:43.909]  Hysteria, I guess you could call it.
[02:26:43.909 --> 02:26:47.109]  So it has been a pretty couple of intense days.
[02:26:47.109 --> 02:26:56.371]  You know, people are worried and one of the most worrying things for me was today I was listening to the BBC London radio and they're talking about
[02:26:57.603 --> 02:27:16.389]  Uh, like what they had in... Vigilantes, you know, they're making a big sort of thing about this vigilante uprising that we're having up in Enfield and they're talking about, oh, should the government empower people and give them powers of arrest and stuff like that.
[02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:22.251]  I was like, whoa, you know, this sounds like a sort of Hitler Youth Brigade system that we're getting set into here.
[02:27:22.251 --> 02:27:23.271]  No one is above the law.
[02:27:24.093 --> 02:27:25.293]  Well, here's the deal, though.
[02:27:25.293 --> 02:27:28.434]  Under common law, you have citizens' arrest.
[02:27:28.434 --> 02:27:30.315]  That's why the cops have arrest.
[02:27:30.315 --> 02:27:36.676]  They're only organized under the citizens' pleasure to do the work for us, because we've got other things to do.
[02:27:36.676 --> 02:27:44.018]  But yes, citizens' brigades can turn into a Hitlerjugend, or it can turn into a Sons of Liberty.
[02:27:44.018 --> 02:27:44.838]  It depends.
[02:27:44.838 --> 02:27:49.960]  But, I mean, if you've got citizens spying on people's speech, which government has set up, it's wrong.
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:28:01.048]  But if you have citizens when they see somebody trying to set fire to a building, beating them upside the head with a baseball bat or a baton, that is common sense.
[02:28:01.048 --> 02:28:08.213]  The difference is the government, who are run by the banks, is organizing people to basically be a spy grid.
[02:28:08.213 --> 02:28:10.014]  They've already done this in England.
[02:28:10.014 --> 02:28:14.017]  Instead of the people should be getting together and marching on the city of London.
[02:28:14.017 --> 02:28:14.618]  Max Keiser.
[02:28:15.469 --> 02:28:22.493]  There's a great way for people to get together and take down a major institution that is completely culpable in these riots.
[02:28:22.493 --> 02:28:31.159]  They should pick a day in September, let's say September 1st, and organize a countrywide boycott and do not pay their BBC license fee.
[02:28:31.849 --> 02:28:48.582]  Take down the BBC for unconscionably setting up these riots by not reporting on the banker scandals for 10 years, for having guys like Jeremy Paxman on every night throwing softballs to the banking establishment, and by supporting the Bank of England and their atrocious confiscation of wealth.
[02:28:48.582 --> 02:28:56.569]  Pick a day, countrywide, don't pay your license fee in the form of civil disobedience, take down a major institution, and then go from there.
[02:28:57.490 --> 02:29:04.257]  And folks, if you don't understand how the banks are confiscating your wealth, they're devaluing every major currency on earth.
[02:29:04.257 --> 02:29:07.901]  They're devaluing every currency with the Swiss franc because they don't control it.
[02:29:07.901 --> 02:29:13.988]  They are devaluing these, they are cheating you, they are robbing you, and they're making a short-term profit.
[02:29:13.988 --> 02:29:16.691]  Anything else, caller?
[02:29:16.691 --> 02:29:18.173]  Alex, let me... yeah.
[02:29:20.457 --> 02:29:24.380]  Let me follow up on that and just say that I have made that suggestion to people in Britain before.
[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:28.482]  And they all come back to me and say, yeah, but it's against the law not to pay your license fee.
[02:29:28.482 --> 02:29:29.823]  I'm going to say, yeah, no kidding.
[02:29:29.823 --> 02:29:32.045]  It's against the law to have your wealth stolen too.
[02:29:32.045 --> 02:29:38.589]  But unless you're willing to go to the front line and do something, you know, this is the easiest form of civil disobedience you could
[02:29:38.949 --> 02:29:40.931]  Well, Max, I'm going to have you expand on that after the break.
[02:29:40.931 --> 02:29:42.672]  We'll get that one comment from Ian.
[02:29:42.672 --> 02:29:45.214]  Then we'll look, and then that's it for callers.
[02:29:45.214 --> 02:29:48.036]  From Angle, we appreciate all of you calling, but Ian will be able to finish up.
[02:29:48.036 --> 02:29:51.538]  Then I want to get into some of the technicals with Max straight ahead.
[02:29:51.538 --> 02:29:52.919]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.919 --> 02:29:55.461]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.461 --> 02:29:58.123]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.981 --> 02:30:06.942]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:06.942 --> 02:30:15.803]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:30:15.803 --> 02:30:20.424]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:30:20.424 --> 02:30:31.246]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:30:31.886 --> 02:30:41.391]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:41.391 --> 02:30:46.833]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:30:46.833 --> 02:30:54.317]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:30:54.317 --> 02:30:57.078]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:00.882 --> 02:31:02.082]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:02.082 --> 02:31:09.005]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:09.005 --> 02:31:11.566]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.566 --> 02:31:16.948]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.948 --> 02:31:19.989]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.989 --> 02:31:22.050]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.290 --> 02:31:28.555]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.555 --> 02:31:31.938]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.938 --> 02:31:37.703]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.703 --> 02:31:39.344]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.344 --> 02:31:40.665]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.665 --> 02:31:43.327]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:47.551]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.551 --> 02:31:49.272]  You can find the video at www.
[02:31:50.333 --> 02:31:52.154]  End of America 3.com.
[02:31:52.154 --> 02:31:54.735]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:31:54.735 --> 02:31:58.618]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:58.618 --> 02:32:00.879]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:00.879 --> 02:32:04.221]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:32:04.221 --> 02:32:08.823]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[02:32:08.823 --> 02:32:17.528]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in 1981.
[02:32:17.528 --> 02:32:18.949]  For a limited time, you get 30%
[02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:20.470]  We're good to go!
[02:32:47.546 --> 02:32:48.869]  A one-year food supply.
[02:32:48.869 --> 02:32:52.155]  If you have ever considered getting a supply, now is the time.
[02:32:52.155 --> 02:32:52.435]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:32:52.435 --> 02:32:54.258]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:33:19.241 --> 02:33:34.691]  Coming out later this evening, we're going to be emailing out to all the InfoWars Insiders the email with exclusive text reports and videos only available when you sign up at InfoWars.com, the top right hand side of the page for the free InfoWars Insider.
[02:33:35.752 --> 02:33:41.416]  And we're doing this, A, because they could shut down our domains in the future.
[02:33:41.416 --> 02:33:42.857]  The Globalist could pull anything.
[02:33:42.857 --> 02:33:51.703]  But if we have a email list, something we never really tried to build over my 16 years on air, boy, if we'd have done that, it'd be like 10 million people.
[02:33:53.456 --> 02:33:59.219]  In the future, we can then, if there's ever an emergency or anything, send you information.
[02:33:59.219 --> 02:34:05.662]  And I'm getting it to where it's gonna be, and it's already automated, where I can upload videos and send them to you directly.
[02:34:05.662 --> 02:34:14.727]  Live time, live feeds, taped feeds, nearly live feeds, where I shoot it, then upload it, five minutes later it's up there, and where I can send it to you.
[02:34:14.727 --> 02:34:20.010]  It's all been designed where a technological moron like myself can control it.
[02:34:20.470 --> 02:34:27.859]  So I'm going to be able to upload videos to PrisonPlanet.tv, also send exclusive ones to folks that are on the email list, on the road, anywhere.
[02:34:27.859 --> 02:34:34.928]  I mean, we can already do this with YouTube, and we do, but we're going to be doing it to the email, because YouTube can shut us down and has tried many times.
[02:34:35.709 --> 02:34:37.110]  So we're having to build our own system.
[02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:41.151]  So sign up at the top of InfoWars.com for the InfoWars Insider.
[02:34:41.151 --> 02:34:48.014]  Right now it only goes out on Wednesday afternoons, but more and more we're going to start sending out special reports at other times as well.
[02:34:48.014 --> 02:34:50.975]  And please forward the email to everyone else as well.
[02:34:50.975 --> 02:34:54.857]  And don't forget to visit great sites like MaxKaiser.com.
[02:34:54.857 --> 02:34:56.857]  Now, we heard from folks in England.
[02:34:56.857 --> 02:34:59.298]  They pretty much concur with my analysis.
[02:34:59.298 --> 02:35:02.960]  The problem is, as I said, they're going to use this to demonize
[02:35:05.026 --> 02:35:25.855]  Legitimate protest demonstrations and you do have a criminal illegitimate government in England and the US and so I've always said that I don't think it's a good idea to get violent at this point to keep trying to fix things peacefully but you can't really criticize people who do basically start resisting the government because it is illegitimate.
[02:35:26.235 --> 02:35:32.819]  But they've craftily set up a control grid ahead of this takedown program.
[02:35:32.819 --> 02:35:35.500]  So Max Keiser, how do you counter that?
[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:42.064]  They've already set up the fake narratives that anybody resisting them is evil, just like Hitler did.
[02:35:42.064 --> 02:35:48.428]  And the general public doesn't understand what the megabanks are doing, this global domination program.
[02:35:48.428 --> 02:35:49.789]  So how do we educate them?
[02:35:50.461 --> 02:35:58.586]  Well, I gave a great idea for a civil disobedience campaign, mobilizing the masses to shut down the BBC by not paying the license fee.
[02:35:58.586 --> 02:36:01.488]  That would swing the balance of power back to the people.
[02:36:01.488 --> 02:36:06.731]  Suddenly, the people have something that they can use as leverage against a major institution.
[02:36:06.731 --> 02:36:08.592]  And let me just point out something here.
[02:36:08.592 --> 02:36:15.276]  You know, Alex, a few months ago, I introduced you to Nomi Prins, a former Goldman Sachs partner, excellent guest.
[02:36:15.276 --> 02:36:16.677]  You've had her on our show a few times.
[02:36:16.677 --> 02:36:17.277]  She's brilliant.
[02:36:17.937 --> 02:36:23.380]  I want to ask you to also consider William K. Black, or Bill Black.
[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:24.480]  You may have had him on your show.
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:30.443]  If you haven't had him on your show, he's the guy who put a thousand bankers in jail during the S&L crisis.
[02:36:30.443 --> 02:36:32.063]  He's a brilliant speaker.
[02:36:32.063 --> 02:36:33.504]  He's available.
[02:36:33.504 --> 02:36:35.225]  You've got to get him on your show.
[02:36:35.225 --> 02:36:37.166]  He can explain these things.
[02:36:37.166 --> 02:36:37.646]  No, no, no.
[02:36:37.646 --> 02:36:39.847]  He's in Fall of the Republic.
[02:36:39.847 --> 02:36:42.808]  He's in the same film that you're in, Max.
[02:36:42.808 --> 02:36:43.248]  Okay.
[02:36:43.248 --> 02:36:44.589]  Well, has he been on the show lately?
[02:36:45.525 --> 02:36:47.126]  No, we need to get him back on.
[02:36:47.126 --> 02:36:53.309]  I just had him on my show, and the guy is, he put a thousand bankers in jail.
[02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:55.671]  He knows exactly what to do.
[02:36:55.671 --> 02:37:09.298]  He knows who to call, and what the entire history... No, he has said that the theft we're seeing is an order of magnitude above any grand larceny ever, and he said it will lead to a total, complete collapse a year and a half ago.
[02:37:09.918 --> 02:37:11.519]  In fall of the Republic.
[02:37:11.519 --> 02:37:23.142]  And so for folks that are tuning in, this is total depression, total collapse, looting and war in the streets, welfare mobs going crazy, unless we reverse what the bankers have done.
[02:37:23.142 --> 02:37:25.363]  So break down what they've done.
[02:37:25.363 --> 02:37:32.265]  We're now at the precipice, where we go from here, if their program of global takeover is not reversed, Max.
[02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:37.353]  Well, you're asking me the kind of how it happened?
[02:37:37.353 --> 02:37:40.555]  I mean, the bigger narrative in terms of the device used?
[02:37:40.555 --> 02:37:56.768]  I mean, I can tell you that in the absence of a true standard for your money, like a gold standard, if you go to an interest rate scheme to determine the value of your money, you set up a dynamic where, and we see this played out in the economy today,
[02:37:57.648 --> 02:38:01.131]  Two forces are at war with each other.
[02:38:01.131 --> 02:38:03.394]  One, the people who want interest rates to be high.
[02:38:03.394 --> 02:38:09.319]  These are people who have working and saving and they want a good rate of return on their money.
[02:38:09.319 --> 02:38:17.547]  And then there are people who want interest rates near zero because they want to be very cheap for them to borrow because they use the borrowed money to speculate.
[02:38:17.547 --> 02:38:20.010]  And when they make a losing bet, they get bailed out.
[02:38:20.610 --> 02:38:22.851]  Okay, so that's the tension.
[02:38:22.851 --> 02:38:35.618]  Now what's happened over the past 10 to 15 years is that the people who have been borrowing and speculating and getting bailed out have used their profits to influence government, to keep interest rates low, and to deregulate markets to make it easier for them to borrow and speculate.
[02:38:35.618 --> 02:38:38.039]  They now control 50 to 60% of the U.S.
[02:38:38.039 --> 02:38:48.144]  economy, depending on how you calculate the way various corporations use cash and derivatives to beef up their profits, beef up their bottom line.
[02:38:48.584 --> 02:38:50.025]  So they control the U.S.
[02:38:50.025 --> 02:38:54.688]  economy, and it's all around this lever of interest rates.
[02:38:54.688 --> 02:38:57.269]  The only balance to return to the U.S.
[02:38:57.269 --> 02:39:04.874]  economy will come if interest rates are higher, and people start to get return on their savings, and you start to get capital.
[02:39:04.874 --> 02:39:06.655]  You don't have capitalism without capital.
[02:39:06.655 --> 02:39:09.897]  You don't have capital without savings, and you can't have savings without higher interest rates.
[02:39:10.377 --> 02:39:12.658]  And that's as clear as the nose on your face.
[02:39:12.658 --> 02:39:20.682]  But the lobbying interest of the Wall Street is so strong, they are not allowing interest rates to rise above zero.
[02:39:20.682 --> 02:39:22.663]  And that is a financial oppression.
[02:39:22.663 --> 02:39:39.012]  It's creating this financial apartheid, because it's creating a permanent underclass of people who never escape poverty and degradation and joblessness, because the economy itself only serves those who are in the business of speculating, borrowing, and getting bailed out.
[02:39:39.785 --> 02:39:45.326]  And so, going forward, the need for interest rates to be higher is paramount.
[02:39:45.326 --> 02:39:50.547]  Now, you'll hear people say that, well, that'll crash the economy, that'll crash real estate, that'll crash things.
[02:39:50.547 --> 02:39:53.128]  It will, in the short term, like it did in Iceland.
[02:39:53.128 --> 02:40:03.449]  But you have the basis upon which to rebuild a new economy that has real jobs and not a financial casino economy that has fake jobs.
[02:40:03.449 --> 02:40:06.250]  It's going to be painful, but you have that pain, you have it.
[02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:10.237]  For a shorter period of time and you keep your sovereignty.
[02:40:10.237 --> 02:40:16.528]  The problem with this system is that it's an easy ride for some and we all lose our sovereignty.
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:19.421]  It certainly is.
[02:40:19.421 --> 02:40:23.105]  Won't the bankers destroy themselves in the end, the banksters?
[02:40:23.105 --> 02:40:31.513]  Because no amount of police state is going to allow them to, in the end, get away with their plan because it destroys everything.
[02:40:31.513 --> 02:40:34.176]  They're cutting cops' pay all over the world.
[02:40:34.176 --> 02:40:35.357]  They're laying police off.
[02:40:35.357 --> 02:40:36.699]  They're laying bureaucrats off.
[02:40:37.384 --> 02:40:46.391]  So they're even laying off many of their own enforcers that are needed to keep the people in line while they're raped by the bankers.
[02:40:46.391 --> 02:40:56.880]  So at a certain point, we're going to be sending military expeditionary forces out like Nazi hunters to bring these bankers back.
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:02.064]  Because they have lost all perception of risk.
[02:41:02.802 --> 02:41:14.269]  When you have a group of people who never get penalized for any of their bad behavior, they just keep getting rewarded for their bad behavior, they lose all perspective on risk.
[02:41:14.269 --> 02:41:16.870]  When you say, aren't they going to just hurt themselves in the end?
[02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:17.991]  Yes, they are!
[02:41:17.991 --> 02:41:22.234]  But they themselves can't comprehend it, because they never make a mistake.
[02:41:22.234 --> 02:41:26.636]  They believe, as Blankfein said at Goldman Sachs, they're doing God's work.
[02:41:26.636 --> 02:41:31.139]  They really have a God complex, in that they believe that everything they touch turns to gold.
[02:41:31.639 --> 02:41:32.420]  Well, well said, Max.
[02:42:01.550 --> 02:42:03.873]  So what's the time frame here?
[02:42:03.873 --> 02:42:05.736]  If this program is not reversed, if they...
[02:42:06.747 --> 02:42:14.110]  Explain to a new listener out there, why is it bad that they've announced that for another two plus years they're going to keep interest rates at zero?
[02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:17.571]  Why did that cause the dollar to accelerate its drop?
[02:42:17.571 --> 02:42:24.693]  Why did that push not just gold and silver up, but other commodities like crude oil, sugar?
[02:42:24.693 --> 02:42:31.716]  Explain to people how the interest rate's being kept at zero and how the free money's being given to the central banks and no one else.
[02:42:32.216 --> 02:42:34.279]  Well that's exactly what I just went over.
[02:42:34.279 --> 02:42:35.420]  In other words, when you have the
[02:42:47.347 --> 02:42:54.275]  Criminals, the borrowers, the speculators, when they account for 50 or 60% of the economy, you need to wash them out.
[02:42:54.275 --> 02:42:55.537]  You need to get rid of them.
[02:42:55.537 --> 02:42:59.181]  And the way that this is done is by raising interest rates.
[02:42:59.181 --> 02:43:06.270]  The classical notion of the job of the Federal Reserve Chairman is when the party gets too wild, they take away the punch bowl.
[02:43:06.910 --> 02:43:08.993]  And they do this by raising interest rates.
[02:43:08.993 --> 02:43:11.415]  Paul Volcker did this in the 70s.
[02:43:11.415 --> 02:43:12.677]  He took interest rates up to 16%, 17%.
[02:43:12.677 --> 02:43:22.948]  It caused a massive recession for two or three years, but it laid the groundwork for the boom of the 80s, 90s, and 2000s.
[02:43:24.509 --> 02:43:33.075]  And this is what's needed periodically to wash out the speculators and the deadwood and the non-performing agents like these banks on Wall Street.
[02:43:33.075 --> 02:43:42.000]  But the Fed, obviously, instead of raising rates as they should to get rid of the bad apples, the deadwood, they're lowering interest rates.
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.821]  They're encouraging the speculation.
[02:43:43.821 --> 02:43:45.122]  They're encouraging the bad behavior.
[02:43:45.122 --> 02:43:45.322]  Why?
[02:43:47.404 --> 02:43:49.526]  They enjoy the free money that they're getting.
[02:43:49.526 --> 02:43:54.890]  They've been co-opted by Wall Street, and Obama's administration is offering no pushback against this.
[02:43:54.890 --> 02:44:00.975]  Tim Geithner is Obama's man on Wall Street, and he's telling Obama lies every single day.
[02:44:00.975 --> 02:44:03.217]  Obama is essentially financially illiterate.
[02:44:03.217 --> 02:44:05.840]  He doesn't know the difference between a stock and a bond.
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:10.624]  He relies totally on Geithner, who's in the pocket of Wall Street, and he's engineering
[02:44:11.244 --> 02:44:21.107]  Zero percent interest rate policy, or ZERP as it's called, because it benefits the same few guys over and over and over again, and the economy is being gutted!
[02:44:21.107 --> 02:44:27.689]  Exactly, they're the only ones that get the zero or negative interest rate and then loan it to people out there for 30% or higher.
[02:44:27.689 --> 02:44:29.150]  Max, 7 o'clock tonight.
[02:44:29.730 --> 02:44:31.171]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:45:06.474 --> 02:45:09.175]  French bank stocks plunge.
[02:45:09.175 --> 02:45:11.716]  UK lowers growth estimate.
[02:45:11.716 --> 02:45:14.337]  Korean broker leaps to death.
[02:45:14.337 --> 02:45:18.698]  Bank of America Goldman lead swoon in US.
[02:45:18.698 --> 02:45:21.999]  Investors heads are spinning.
[02:45:21.999 --> 02:45:25.560]  And down below that you have the headline gold vaults above 1,800.
[02:45:27.741 --> 02:45:50.213]  Today the stock market has continued its drop earlier in the day going up a little while ago, but now continuing its drop And we'll go over more of that financial news in the final segment coming up But again, we got a special report tonight in the aftermath of all this we're gonna be watching it all unfold and explain to people We're doing two or three special reports every

[02:46:23.411 --> 02:46:28.175]  But tonight we'll do a 25-30 minute report with Max Keiser via video Skype.
[02:46:28.175 --> 02:46:30.858]  You'll be able to watch that if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[02:46:30.858 --> 02:46:35.141]  That's how we pay for the equipment, the crew, the people, the cameras, all of it.
[02:46:35.982 --> 02:46:43.550]  And then of course we're more than happy that it leaks out to the entire internet and we will post large portions of it at the YouTube channel.
[02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:47.614]  But that can't be completely counted on because more and more they're shutting our channels down.
[02:46:47.614 --> 02:46:51.078]  I've had to file in federal court against YouTube when they claim I violate their...
[02:46:52.639 --> 02:46:56.221]  They're terms of use to prove that I haven't just to have that one channel.
[02:46:56.221 --> 02:47:00.042]  We've put some backup channels out there, but they can't be completely counted on.
[02:47:00.042 --> 02:47:02.443]  So yes, you do get a lot of it.
[02:47:02.443 --> 02:47:06.925]  Our mission is to get the word out at the end of the day, but we also need financial support.
[02:47:06.925 --> 02:47:11.847]  And that's why I want to encourage folks to notice we've upgraded PrisonPlanet.tv in its eight years.
[02:47:11.847 --> 02:47:12.848]  We're adding more and more.
[02:47:13.388 --> 02:47:21.119]  The live audio streams, the higher quality podcast audio, the live video podcast of this show, archived every day, also streamed live.
[02:47:21.119 --> 02:47:27.649]  My book, Paul Watson's book, many other films, all my films, expanded extras, the new live...
[02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:33.513]  Streamed, nightly reports, special reports, the new news show.
[02:47:33.513 --> 02:47:37.535]  It's going to be highly produced compared to anything else we've ever done and focused.
[02:47:37.535 --> 02:47:38.756]  I'm going to be disciplined.
[02:47:38.756 --> 02:47:40.136]  I'm better when I'm disciplined.
[02:47:40.136 --> 02:47:42.518]  For 30 minutes every night, 7 p.m.
[02:47:42.518 --> 02:47:45.199]  It's all coming to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:47:45.199 --> 02:47:49.621]  PrisonPlanet.tv because things always get attacked and shut down.
[02:47:49.621 --> 02:47:50.402]  It's still going to be there.
[02:47:50.962 --> 02:48:00.370]  We're gonna have a more cut-and-dry, starting-from-the-bottom, new technological, easier-to-use system in the next six months or so.
[02:48:00.370 --> 02:48:09.537]  And PrisonPlanet.tv's great, but you're still gonna have that, but if you're a member of that, you'll also automatically be a member of the new news site that we're setting up.
[02:48:09.537 --> 02:48:19.906]  And if you believe in this information, if you believe in the fight we're putting forward here, if you believe in us identifying the real global enemy, not the puppet Obama or Bush or all this other garbage,
[02:48:21.166 --> 02:48:24.209]  Or liquor stores, the drunks are thieving.
[02:48:24.209 --> 02:48:29.212]  The globalists are going to turn the welfare hordes loose to attack the general public.
[02:48:29.212 --> 02:48:32.715]  Then the government's going to come in to protect you from the welfare hordes.
[02:48:32.715 --> 02:48:34.916]  That's where I disagree with Max Keiser.
[02:48:34.916 --> 02:48:38.599]  He's saying, well, overall, this is just a symptom of the rot.
[02:48:38.599 --> 02:48:40.500]  And I agree with him.
[02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:42.762]  But we're in trouble.
[02:48:42.762 --> 02:48:48.586]  So again, I want to encourage everybody out there to become a PrisonPlanet.tv member today.
[02:48:49.471 --> 02:48:56.538]  Now, going to Ted Anderson for the balance of this segment and the next, getting into gold news, and obviously I'm here pitching gold at you.
[02:48:56.538 --> 02:49:00.743]  The prices of gold and silver Ted has are always extremely competitive.
[02:49:00.743 --> 02:49:03.646]  The radio specials are loss leaders.
[02:49:03.646 --> 02:49:08.731]  He either makes a tiny profit or no profit, and if he miscalculates, a negative profit.
[02:49:08.731 --> 02:49:11.995]  Now, I told you three months ago when they artificially drove it down to buy gold and silver.
[02:49:12.978 --> 02:49:18.322]  You know, back when they drove down silver to 25 bucks an ounce and, you know, gold by a couple hundred.
[02:49:18.322 --> 02:49:22.465]  Now gold is up, I don't know, what is it, 400 bucks in the last month.
[02:49:22.465 --> 02:49:25.547]  Silver has surged back up to 40-something.
[02:49:25.547 --> 02:49:27.148]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:49:27.148 --> 02:49:34.073]  They've decided to devalue every major global currency except the Swiss franc because they're still sovereign.
[02:49:34.073 --> 02:49:37.095]  Because the globalists want one place to hide out from their own destruction.
[02:49:38.447 --> 02:49:40.728]  Now, gold and silver are only going to go up.
[02:49:40.728 --> 02:49:47.952]  Now, Ted, talking to you this morning, the gold you've got is from when it was at, what, 16 or 16 and a half a few weeks ago.
[02:49:47.952 --> 02:49:49.173]  You're running out of that.
[02:49:49.173 --> 02:49:53.055]  Soon you'll be selling it from the 1800, and it'll seem cheap then.
[02:49:53.055 --> 02:49:55.636]  But you've got gold, you've got silver going to break.
[02:49:55.636 --> 02:49:57.658]  I'll come back with the news on this.
[02:49:57.658 --> 02:49:59.819]  Tell folks the gold and silver offers you've got right now.
[02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:05.161]  Well, again, Alex, I think it's just incredibly important that people pick up small pieces of gold.
[02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:09.643]  The franc coin at $390 is a great buy.
[02:50:09.643 --> 02:50:11.223]  I mean, it's a small piece of gold.
[02:50:11.223 --> 02:50:12.324]  It's recognizable.
[02:50:12.324 --> 02:50:13.864]  It can be used anywhere as money.
[02:50:13.864 --> 02:50:15.985]  British sovereigns are $489.
[02:50:15.985 --> 02:50:17.685]  By the way, the franc is a fifth of an ounce.
[02:50:17.685 --> 02:50:19.306]  British sovereigns are a quarter of an ounce.
[02:50:20.146 --> 02:50:24.611]  Um, even, you know, I talked about $20 Liberties here just the other day at $2,000.
[02:50:24.611 --> 02:50:26.392]  They're at $2,200.
[02:50:26.392 --> 02:50:28.635]  Gold Spot today hit over $1,800.
[02:50:28.635 --> 02:50:32.258]  I mean, people, you need to wake up on this stuff.
[02:50:32.258 --> 02:50:38.184]  I mean, silver is starting to run with it, and we should be picking up those silver dollars in those books and DVDs.
[02:50:38.184 --> 02:50:40.526]  I mean, people really need to take
[02:50:41.387 --> 02:50:44.612]  Yeah, now's the time to get the word back.
[02:50:44.612 --> 02:50:48.878]  800-686-2237 to call the Midas Brokers.
[02:50:48.878 --> 02:50:50.040]  Tell them it's the radio special.
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:50.340]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:56.769]  Ted, I want to come back and talk about this gold market and where you see it going in the future.
[02:50:56.769 --> 02:50:57.470]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:57.470 --> 02:50:57.871]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.567 --> 02:51:02.088]  We're good to go.
[02:51:16.527 --> 02:51:23.769]  You already know OpticsPlanet.com has the best selection of weapon lights, holsters, night vision, binoculars, and tactical gear on the planet.

[02:51:57.764 --> 02:51:57.804]  800-332-6784.
[02:52:02.463 --> 02:52:07.168]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:52:07.168 --> 02:52:13.595]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:52:13.595 --> 02:52:15.878]  Number one, study the past.
[02:52:15.878 --> 02:52:18.260]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:52:18.260 --> 02:52:21.984]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:52:23.109 --> 02:52:26.191]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:52:26.191 --> 02:52:30.033]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:52:30.033 --> 02:52:39.098]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:52:39.098 --> 02:52:42.500]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:46.143]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:52:46.983 --> 02:52:51.906]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:52:51.906 --> 02:52:56.529]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:52:56.529 --> 02:52:59.231]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:03.282]  Big Berkey Water Filters are in high demand.
[02:53:03.282 --> 02:53:05.343]  Storable foods are also in high demand.
[02:53:05.343 --> 02:53:10.386]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has always kept our focus on the Berkey Water Filter products.
[02:53:10.386 --> 02:53:14.069]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.
[02:53:14.069 --> 02:53:21.294]  After months of research, BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com now offers great tasting, long-lasting, storable foods.
[02:53:21.294 --> 02:53:24.876]  These ready-to-eat meals are packed in airtight nitrogen pouches.
[02:53:24.876 --> 02:53:26.197]  All you do is just add water.
[02:53:26.437 --> 02:53:30.339]  And because they're sealed so well, they come with a 25-year shelf life.
[02:53:30.339 --> 02:53:39.503]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.
[02:53:39.503 --> 02:53:46.506]  Remember, we offer free shipping on every order over $50, and GCN listeners receive 5% off all ceramic filter systems.
[02:53:46.906 --> 02:53:52.408]  You know the big news here is in the last few days we've had articles that our writers put together
[02:54:16.229 --> 02:54:25.033]  At Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, reporting that the Pentagon, Homeland Security, are watching U.S.
[02:54:25.033 --> 02:54:33.457]  citizens on Facebook, Twitter, and the Internet that talk about protesting the private Federal Reserve.
[02:54:33.457 --> 02:54:36.478]  That's what they're scared about.
[02:54:36.478 --> 02:54:38.639]  They're scared of the Bank of England being protested.
[02:54:39.591 --> 02:54:43.133]  They're scared of the private Federal Reserve being protested.
[02:54:43.133 --> 02:54:55.681]  You know, the footage is in the Obama deception, but a few years ago it came out that the Army went to Ron Paul's in the Fed event in Houston, and to our event in Dallas.
[02:54:55.681 --> 02:54:57.643]  The Army was there.
[02:54:57.643 --> 02:55:03.006]  See, the Army isn't there when people are burning down your house.
[02:55:03.006 --> 02:55:05.428]  The Army's there at Katrina to come take your guns.
[02:55:07.814 --> 02:55:11.395]  And the Army's there to watch Ron Paul, because the Army doesn't work for us anymore.
[02:55:11.395 --> 02:55:14.615]  It works for the foreign banks.
[02:55:14.615 --> 02:55:19.596]  And so, yes, I know Gary Franchi led a protest against the big banks.
[02:55:19.596 --> 02:55:21.937]  This other fellow, we just saw the video from We Are Change.
[02:55:21.937 --> 02:55:24.557]  We're going to get it up at Infowars.com right now.
[02:55:24.557 --> 02:55:31.318]  He announced that he was going to have a demonstration or flash mob outside of New York Fed, and 50 cops showed up.
[02:55:31.318 --> 02:55:32.438]  Nobody else joined him.
[02:55:32.438 --> 02:55:32.978]  Didn't matter.
[02:55:32.978 --> 02:55:34.319]  It got attention.
[02:55:34.319 --> 02:55:35.579]  Start identifying.
[02:55:37.472 --> 02:55:40.555]  And I guarantee you, these welfare people, they want iPads, folks.
[02:55:40.555 --> 02:55:41.916]  They don't care about freedom.
[02:55:41.916 --> 02:55:43.277]  This isn't a revolution.
[02:55:43.277 --> 02:55:48.442]  This is a sign the welfare folks aren't getting as fat a check as they used to because they've been devalued.
[02:55:48.442 --> 02:55:49.843]  Going back to Ted.
[02:55:49.843 --> 02:55:54.988]  Ted, have you ever seen anything like this with what's happening with gold right now?
[02:55:54.988 --> 02:55:58.411]  Way past its all-time high, silver shooting back up right now.
[02:55:59.269 --> 02:56:02.113]  No, there's never been a market like this in my lifetime.
[02:56:02.113 --> 02:56:05.797]  I'm sure there has been if you go back in history, but never in my lifetime.
[02:56:05.797 --> 02:56:11.604]  And I started when Jimmy Carter was in office, and we had double-digit inflation.
[02:56:11.604 --> 02:56:16.209]  And when Max Keiser was talking about raising the interest rates, Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker.
[02:56:16.810 --> 02:56:17.231]  I don't know.
[02:56:31.827 --> 02:56:32.807]  We're good to go.
[02:56:58.975 --> 02:57:06.002]  The foreign countries don't trust the United States dollar anymore, and now it's been downgraded our bonds, and that's going to make it go even further.
[02:57:06.002 --> 02:57:16.131]  Yeah, bottom line, they have decided to fully pull the plug on America and Western Europe to bankrupt us by design to set up their world government on its ashes.
[02:57:16.131 --> 02:57:18.514]  All of Obama's controllers, all the globalists,
[02:57:19.676 --> 02:57:21.197]  Have talked about this.
[02:57:21.197 --> 02:57:24.119]  They're getting even wealthier in the process.
[02:57:24.119 --> 02:57:25.539]  This is economic warfare.
[02:57:25.539 --> 02:57:29.922]  Our government is run by premeditating criminal scum.
[02:57:29.922 --> 02:57:35.345]  And the bare minimum we can do is spread the word about it on AM and FM radio, satellite, shortwave.
[02:57:35.345 --> 02:57:37.646]  Spread the word about this show.
[02:57:37.646 --> 02:57:41.188]  The system does not want people to hear this.
[02:57:41.188 --> 02:57:42.369]  Mainline talk radio
[02:57:43.209 --> 02:57:47.792]  Is barely starting to get a clue, which shows me that that's some good news.
[02:57:47.792 --> 02:57:49.793]  A few years ago they had no clue.
[02:57:49.793 --> 02:57:52.535]  We either get this information out or it's over.
[02:57:53.544 --> 02:58:02.866]  Well, that's exactly why I'm offering three of your videos, the Obama Deception, Follow the Republican, Endgame, for a total shipped price of $130.
[02:58:02.866 --> 02:58:06.587]  Because they're going to get these videos new in hand.
[02:58:06.587 --> 02:58:10.188]  I mean, you can go tell somebody to try to find it on YouTube, and it's worthless.
[02:58:10.188 --> 02:58:11.288]  You can actually make it.
[02:58:11.288 --> 02:58:13.748]  You didn't add the part about the three silver dollars, and then three.
[02:58:13.748 --> 02:58:16.029]  I'm sorry, there are three silver dollars to go with it.
[02:58:16.029 --> 02:58:21.550]  I guess I should put that in there, because it tells you that now you're going to have silver, which is what you're going to need anyway.
[02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:26.372]  Yeah, you pay cost on the silver dollars and you get three of my films free.
[02:58:26.372 --> 02:58:28.192]  And free shipping as well.
[02:58:28.192 --> 02:58:34.915]  They also have the two silver dollars and the Mark Dice book and the film free with free shipping.
[02:58:34.915 --> 02:58:35.975]  You can also call about that.
[02:58:35.975 --> 02:58:37.276]  But it's time to get into gold and silver.
[02:58:37.276 --> 02:58:37.316]  800-686-2237.
