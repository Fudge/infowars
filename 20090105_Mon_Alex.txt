[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:30.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  Welcome. We are live.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  It is the fifth day of January 2009.
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  We'll be here live for the next four hours.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  For the last hour and a half of the show,
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  we're going to have Dr. Russell Blalock,
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  a brain surgeon, a neurosurgeon joining us
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  to go over the dangers of not just aspartame.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  I had him on for about 45 minutes a few weeks ago,
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  and it just wasn't enough time to cover it all.
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  But also, other excitotoxins like MSG and other additives
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.000]  that are put into your food, many of them petrochemicals.
[01:04.000 --> 01:07.000]  You see, because we're an oil-based economy,
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  there's all those byproducts of the creation of gasoline,
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  and they have to do something with them.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  So they just, back in the 40s and 50s,
[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  created a whole new industry of putting many of those toxins
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  in your foods as additives.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  Most of the big pharma drugs they make over the counter
[01:25.000 --> 01:29.000]  and prescription are byproducts of petrochemicals
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  and their toxic waste byproduct.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  Same thing with fluoride.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  They had just millions and millions of tons,
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  conservatively, just in Tennessee alone, because aluminum
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  and a bunch of other metals were involved
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  in the purification of uranium.
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  The sodium fluoride led arsenic cyanide that they used
[01:56.000 --> 02:02.000]  to basically cook out the uranium out of the rocks.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  And so they said, we'll just call it fluoride,
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  because it's not just sodium fluoride,
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  it's a toxic waste, and by law put it in the water
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  instead of having to store the toxic waste.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  I mean, that's on public record.
[02:13.000 --> 02:15.000]  So it's not just sodium fluoride when you hear them talking
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  about fluoride.
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  It's a catch-all term and name for hundreds and hundreds
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  of substances, and none of this is even a secret.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  It's just not widely known, so we'll talk about some ways
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  we can take control of our lives and try to minimize
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  the amount of these toxins and poisons that we're all
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  ingesting with Dr. Russell Blalock coming up
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  in about two and a half hours.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  In the meantime, there is a lot of news and information
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  that we are going to be covering today on the economy front,
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  on obviously what's happening over in the Gaza Strip right now,
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  and as we accelerate towards the inauguration on the 20th
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  of January of Barack H. Obama, and the big surprise,
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  the unpopular stance that we're supposedly going to see him
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  carry out, and I think more and more it's becoming clear
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  that it's a host of issues that are going to be unpopular,
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  according to Colin Powell and Biden and many others.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  But chief among them, the Israeli papers of all places
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  are admitting what we'd already reported here,
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  that this is a multi-year plan to attack the Gaza Strip
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  and that Israel did break the ceasefire themselves,
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  knowing they were planning to do it the entire time,
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  to then go into the Gaza Strip and circle the three major cities
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  that have a million and a half people living in them,
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  chief among them, Gaza City, and then to rocket and attack
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  and bomb those areas like Fallujah until everyone basically
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  has their back broken, and then they can be expelled
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  from the country.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  There's a key article by Professor Michelle Chassadowski
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  up on infowars.com right now that we have a link to
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  that is just so important because it goes through all
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  of Israel's own admissions. This is not our opinion.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  This is a fact.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  And then meanwhile, our control corporate press is cold-bloodedly
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.000]  lying to the American people telling us that basically Hamas
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  launched the attacks on Israel and that they're doing all this
[04:27.000 --> 04:32.000]  for no reason, and they only report on the dead IDF soldiers.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  It's all very one-sided.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Kind of like when the news announced that Russia had
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  stuck attack Georgia. Total lie, but hey, so what?
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  Might as well just go ahead and lie to the public.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  I mean, even if you're not choosing sides in this whole thing,
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  do you like being lied to? Do you like the fact that our media
[04:47.000 --> 05:00.000]  is a pack of criminals? Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  Hello friends. This is Alex Jones.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient
[05:05.000 --> 05:07.000]  and today that's more important than ever.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA
[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  will slash your life savings to nothing
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  and blast the cost of massacres,
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  The private banks, merging with our government,
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.000]  and paying for other necessities.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand
[06:19.000 --> 06:22.000]  that by having a supply of storable food, the government,
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.000]  the new old order has a lot less control over you
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the final list of high quality,
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  freeze dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.000]  Watch the free videos.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  Look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.000]  Take action today.
[07:05.000 --> 07:12.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[07:12.000 --> 07:13.000]  Big brother.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  Mainstream media.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  Government cover-ups.
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.000]  You want answers?
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  Well so does he.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[07:24.000 --> 07:39.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  I specifically, coming up at the bottom of the hour,
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  want to hear from listeners across the world,
[07:45.000 --> 07:52.000]  Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, the UK, France,
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  Canada, the United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina,
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.000]  Costa Rica, doesn't matter where you are, Australia.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  Over the weekend, I've been watching international feeds
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  and I want to get your take on what's happening in Gaza.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  And you watch the British news.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  It's 50-50.
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  We're actually pretty balanced reporting on what's happening
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  in Gaza over in the Middle East right now,
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  bordering the Mediterranean Sea.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  And if you watch the European press,
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  it's about 75% in favor.
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  The vast majority of it's in favor.
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  That's just a dead reckoning when I say 75%.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  Maybe it's 80%, 90%.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  In favor of the Palestinians there in Gaza.
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  But here in the United States, it's completely one-sided.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  And that's why the public is so ill-informed here,
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  is because we have such a horrible corporate media.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  You know, this is the same corporate media that told us
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.000]  two, three years ago to keep getting loans on your houses,
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  take money out to take a trip or to, you know,
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  just blow some money or go shopping.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.000]  And we were telling you that the derivatives market
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  was a scam.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  The private banks were planning to cut off liquidity
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  to cause a global consolidation.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  We were called cooks.
[09:24.000 --> 09:27.000]  You know, we said buy gold when it was 280 bucks an ounce,
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.000]  and now it's 850 something bucks an ounce.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  But the mainstream media is still saying,
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  on average, don't buy it.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  And now there's a bunch of press reports out last weekend
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  and today going, you know, it's the media causing the problems
[09:41.000 --> 09:42.000]  in the economy.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  They've destroyed confidence.
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  It's their fault.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  You know, really the mainstream media is finally being forced
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  to tell a little bit more of the truth about the economy.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  They'll tell you it's bad, but then they lie
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  when they tell you it happened by accident
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  or that it wasn't planned that way.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  But you do have the Economist magazine coming out
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  and saying we're in a depression.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  You do have the Prime Minister of Canada saying that.
[10:08.000 --> 10:10.000]  You do have world leaders saying that.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  Remember, nine weeks ago, the government reversed itself.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  They said we're not even in a recession.
[10:15.000 --> 10:16.000]  Everything's fine.
[10:16.000 --> 10:17.000]  It's pessimist.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  The economy is great.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  And then when Congress wouldn't hand over complete
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  and total imperial power to the Treasury Department
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.000]  and the private Federal Reserve,
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  where no oversight could be engaged in,
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.000]  suddenly the Treasury Secretary, the Fed Chairman,
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  the private Fed, President Bush, Barack Obama,
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  they all went to Capitol Hill.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  Barack Obama was the king of parading
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  and kind of honchoing the whole thing through.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  He was the whip.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  He was the slave driver.
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  And they said we are going to have a total depression
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.000]  by next week if you don't pass this $700 billion bailout.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  And then people read the bill and they said,
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.000]  but it says unlimited money.
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.000]  It says no oversight.
[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  It says by law, no agency, no court,
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.000]  no branch of government can look at what the Federal Reserve does.
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  Yeah, it was War Powers Act and now Bloomberg,
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  and I keep mentioning this is such a big deal,
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  Bloomberg Financial two weeks ago,
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  headline with the Federal Reserve Board Governor saying,
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  we're not even involved now.
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  Only the Fed group out of New York
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  and an inner group in the Treasury,
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  and they've told us War Powers has been enacted.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  All at the same time with Congress,
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  two Congressmen and a senator saying they were threatened
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  with martial law.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  I mean, this is really happening.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  We're already under martial law.
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  We're already under a North American Union.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  And we're going headlong into youth cores
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  and compulsory draft 18 to 24,
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.000]  and people that are 45, 65, you know,
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  they'll have to serve domestically,
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  but everybody 18 to 24 in the military
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  and junior high and high school have to serve
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.000]  in domestic spy cores.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  That's not Alex Jones saying that.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  They're proposing it.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  I've got an article here where Nancy Pelosi's proposing,
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  quote, equalizing everyone's pay in America.
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  Talk about communism as if that's really going to happen.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  They're just going to take the middle class money,
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  and she even says so we can help our immigrants.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  Take our money, take the middle class money,
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  and everybody else's money and ruin our future,
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  and then she has the gall to say it's for the immigrants.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  I don't mean I'm all over the map here.
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.000]  It's so wild to witness all of this unfolding.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  Here's an article out of the Memphis Business Journal.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  There's many of these.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  It's a talking point today.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  Most Americans say media making crisis worse.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  Talk about living in denial.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  And it is true that the fundamentals of the collapse,
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  the controlled crisis,
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  were hidden from the public until three months ago,
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  two and a half months ago,
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  and then when the establishment wanted to terrorize everyone
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  with financial terrorism,
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  they said we're going to have a depression.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  We could have a total collapse,
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  and then that destroyed final confidence,
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  and then the markets really started sliding.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  Remember that thousand point plunge the day
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  they didn't pass the bailout?
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  Remember the trillions of dollars that were lost?
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  Who did that?
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  And then now the media really is spinning things
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  and saying there's a light ahead.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  Barack Obama will fix it, but yes, we're in trouble.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  Just do whatever he says and he'll fix it.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And they even got Pat Robertson coming out and saying,
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  global warming's real.
[13:43.000 --> 13:45.000]  We've got to have a global tax.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  And by the way, God told me that nothing can stop Obama
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  and that socialism will ease your pains
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  and the American people will accept it
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  and it's inevitable and you will be assimilated.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  Resist is futile.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  They're in the prisonplanet.tv show today
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  when we go live for simulcasting at one o'clock central
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  for the last two hours.
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  I'm going to play that clip on air so you can see him.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  Last Friday, literally in the newscast,
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  he says God tells him this.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  And she says you're like Moses in the mountain
[14:18.000 --> 14:24.000]  and he goes, yes, I go and then God tells me.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  God tells me every year on the day after New Year's.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  I mean, this guy, talk about a shill.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  So they're telling you it's inevitable.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  Give in to whatever Obama says, nothing can stop him.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  And the crowd of sheep are just going, yes,
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  not in their heads.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.000]  Yes, it cuts to them.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  Yes.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  Most Americans say media making crisis worse.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  See, what is the media actually been blaming the crisis on?
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  It's been blaming it on the auto manufacturers.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  That caused all of it.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  But before it was the subprime mortgage.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  But they said we have to have the 700 billion by Friday or Monday.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  We'll be in a depression and the stock market will drop to 3,000.
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  We're talking about total financial armageddon.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  We must have it.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  And if you don't do it, Congress will just declare martial law.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  And then the next day by Saturday, they passed it on Friday,
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  Bush signed it on Friday.
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.000]  They said, you know what?
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  We don't need that for subprime mortgage anymore.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  That really wasn't the problem.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  And then we had all these bank chairmen in the news saying,
[15:30.000 --> 15:31.000]  there's really no problem.
[15:31.000 --> 15:41.000]  We're just taking record bonuses and buying other healthy financial institutions
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  and insurance companies.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  Remember that?
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  We're supposed to forget all of that, just like we're supposed to forget
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  that George Bush in that crowd said that Iraq had WMDs.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  And then later said they never said that.
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  That's another video I'm going to play coming up during prisonplanet.tv live
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  transmission when we simulcast the radio show.
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  Just a five minute video of what they said previously than what they said after.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  Because they didn't just say after, oh, we were wrong.
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  They said, we never said that.
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.000]  That's a lie.
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  And then now we're all supposed to forget about it.
[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  That's what Obama's saying in all of his speeches.
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  He's saying, look, forget about the past.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  We're not going to have any investigations.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  We're not going to look at what's going on.
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  We're just going to move forward.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  Let's be positive.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  Do whatever I say.
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  And then after he's committed eight years of crimes, the next administration will say,
[16:35.000 --> 16:37.000]  let's just forget what happened in the past.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  Let's just move forward.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  77% of Americans think the U.S. media are making the economic situation worse
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  by highlighting negative news as a result, lowering consumer confidence,
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  and investment activity.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  Well, yeah, because now it's time to butcher America.
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  When they were setting up the Ponzi scheme to steal your pension funds
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  and to take over the entire economy and deindustrializing the nation
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  so we could never rise again, they were telling you everything was Valhalla
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  and great and globalism was wonderful and NAFTA and GATT
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  and the World Trade Organization was as fantastic as mom and apple pie.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  Then when they're ready to blow everything out and consolidate
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  and use the tens of trillions, and it's now the tens of trillions worldwide,
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  8.5 trillions in the U.S. that the banks have stolen out of the treasuries of the world,
[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  now they're the only ones flushed with cash to buy at the fire sale.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  It's a real simple system.
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted in early December by Opinion Research Corps,
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  which asked, do you think the financial presence making the crisis worse
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  by projecting fear into people's minds?
[17:42.000 --> 17:48.000]  Broke down by income, 79% said yes from households making 25,000, 35,000
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  and 78% said yes from households making more than 75,000.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  By demographic, 85% and 18 and 24 year olds said yes,
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  while 65% of African Americans agreed.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  All those statements by the media are protected by the First Amendment.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  The survey results demonstrate that the public believes that the press bears
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  some responsibility for the lack of confidence in the economy.
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  The jab at the First Amendment C, the First Amendment's causing this.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  It's not offshore banks.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Richard Schiff said that.
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  The First Amendment's causing a problem.
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  Vice Chairman and partner of the Philadelphia-based law firm Montgomery,
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  McCracken, Walker and Rhodes in a statement.
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  Here's another one out of the examiner, San Francisco.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  This is a Baltimore examiner, excuse me.
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.000]  I believe media making economy worse.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  So that's what's going on there.
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.000]  Okay, when we get back, I'm getting into what's happening in Gaza.
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  I'm going to finish up with the economy.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  Some headlines there.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Then I'm going to get into what's happening in Gaza
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000]  and take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[18:57.000 --> 19:12.000]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off,
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  Ready Reserve foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  for the promised changes of the new administration
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  and to help you and your families survive the global economic crash.
[19:21.000 --> 19:24.000]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  Between now and January 20, 2009,
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.000]  all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  That's a 33% savings.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  A year's supply of meal starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[19:37.000 --> 19:41.000]  Ready Reserve food offers only the highest quality to hydrated food.
[19:41.000 --> 19:44.000]  Packed in doubly-nammeled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere,
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  allowing a 15-plus-year shelf life.
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  Ready Reserve has been manufacturing since 1972,
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  giving them the freedom to offer you amazing savings.
[19:53.000 --> 19:56.000]  Great tasting Ready Reserve foods at wholesale prices.

[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  1-800-453-2202.
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  Have you ever felt like the United States government
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.000]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures,
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.000]  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[20:24.000 --> 20:27.000]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act,
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.000]  the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984,
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  are subject to government intervention.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  For this reason, Mitus Resources has prepared a report
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[20:44.000 --> 20:47.000]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Mitus Resources or not,
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  1-800-686-2237.
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  But who is the enemy?
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.000]  It's been Laundering.
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  This is his ammo.
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.000]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  In Laundering's connections to the CIA,
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  and much, much more, fabled enemies.
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  Get the DVD at infowars.com,
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  or see it in super high quality,
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  The headlines are clear.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  Governments are calling for a new world, cashless economic system.
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.000]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  To stay free.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  More true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  John Lipska, host of Don't Tread on Me,
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  Restaurants and small delis don't buy from copycats.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  Their fancy packaging is not free.
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  Order today, before it's too late.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  Survivalistseeds.com.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  That's Survivalistseeds.com.
[23:04.000 --> 23:15.000]  A long-term food solution.
[23:15.000 --> 23:35.000]  We're not just going to cover what's happening in Gaza and the economy.
[23:35.000 --> 23:50.000]  The top brain surgeon, neurologist Dr. Russell Blalock, an award-winning brain surgeon.
[23:50.000 --> 23:55.000]  He has multiple degrees, medical degrees, and studying the brain.
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.000]  That's coming up the last hour and a half of the show today.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  And I'm going to be covering UFOs.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  UFO is on PrisonPlanet.tv today when we go live in an hour and 40 minutes.
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  I may even go live earlier because I need plenty of time to cover the video clips.
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.000]  But I'll be describing them on the radio, posting them up at infowars.com
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  for folks that don't have PrisonPlanet.tv to follow along.
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  I remember, even before I got on the air, 20 years ago,
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  I liked reading military publications and scientific publications
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  on the mainline, stuff like popular mechanics.
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  And they talked about how the government was going to have giant blimps for warfare
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.000]  that are up at 80,000, 90,000 feet that are unmanned and that run off solar power
[24:43.000 --> 24:48.000]  and that can stay in position for years over major cities.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  And then they can see for hundreds of miles in all directions
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  with ground-penetrating radar looking through your walls with surveillance cameras.
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  And then after 9-11, Homeland Security said,
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  we're going to tether these over every major city.
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  And CNN had headlines showing one of the blimps being tested above D.C.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  And I covered it in my film Marshall Law.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  They had the Fuji blimp out, sponsored by Fuji run by the NYPD.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  Now, since then, they've put these blimps over Dallas and D.C. and L.A.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  and people go out with these telephoto video cameras.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  ABC and CNN and Larry King says aliens are invading.
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  Look at the giant cigar-shaped craft.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  And you can blow it up and see that it's got the propellers on it
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.000]  and it's got the devices for surveillance and it's a blimp.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  I mean, as much as if you go to a firehouse and say that's a fire engine
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  or if you see a black and white spotted large dog, you go,
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  that's a Dalmatian in a firehouse.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  I mean, or if you see me on TV, you go, that's Alex Jones.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  I mean, there's no debating it's a blimp.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  There's no debating it's not a flying saucer.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  And I haven't weighed in on all this UFO stuff.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  And I have no doubt in the endless reaches of billions of galaxies
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  photographed by Hubble just within the field of view of Earth.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  I mean, I don't begin to even claim that there's not such a thing as space aliens.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  The point is, I cover what I can prove.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  And the media cynically is making fun of the public
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  saying that aliens, oh my gosh, a thing three football fields long.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  It was over Dallas. Look at it.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  And it's a blimp.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  Silver blimp. It's even the classic color.
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  It's got the propellers on it.
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.000]  It's got big blisters of cameras and devices and surveillance.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  And the government announced they were going to do this.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  But then now, ABC News called the FAA and they said that they see nothing on their radar.
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  Well, yeah, because it's at 100,000 feet.
[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  And the FAA has been told to lie to you because it's national security.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000]  So now that the blimps are being deployed, they'll just tell the public that it doesn't exist.
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.000]  And like children, they'll say, OK, then it's green aliens with big black bug eyes are up in it.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.000]  And when they launch these blimps, they're always launched out of Fort Hood.
[27:12.000 --> 27:21.000]  They're launched out of Area 51 and everybody freaks out and goes, oh, look, the aliens, the aliens, it's rising.
[27:21.000 --> 27:30.000]  And it moves slowly like a blimp and goes up and they are attacking aliens, aliens.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  In fact, it's come out in the last few years out in Arizona, New Mexico, West Texas around military bases.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  People would see these these drones.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  And it's the exact drones that the Pentagon has shown that companies have made their prototype testing them.
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  They're battlefield surveillance drones.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  They have a little fan in them, a little turbine.
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.000]  They're two feet across, five feet across, six feet in different sizes.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  They've had them for decades.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  And so separately on the news, they'll show you the drones.
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  And then you'll see the exact drones out somebody's back window.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  Oh, my gosh, it's aliens.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  Look, and then the news will be aliens were seen flying around.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  They're going to get us, the government will keep you safe from them.
[28:08.000 --> 28:14.000]  And it's a surveillance drone.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  Okay, I guess I'm already covering this.
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.000]  The point is later it's coming up because, I mean, these videos and there's hundreds of them.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  I mean, it's blimps.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  It's a blimp.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  I mean, is the public going to run outside and point at the Goodyear blimp and say, look, it says Goodyear.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  It's an alien.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  They're from Planet Michelin.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  The aliens are big white creatures with roly-poly skin.
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  Some say it looks like the Michelin man, but others say it may be Al-Qaeda from Planet Quiggle Snap in the Pop-Tart sector.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  All right, I'm sorry. I've already digressed.
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  I'm going to take your phone calls, get into Gaza, the economy a lot more, stay with us.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  My websites are prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Stay with us.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  We're on the march.
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  It's on the run.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:08.000 --> 29:13.000]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  Only to find the one that you have is broken.
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  The batteries are dead or it's just not bright enough.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  You need the pack light.
[29:20.000 --> 29:28.000]  The pack light is the longest lasting flashlight on the market and simply snaps onto any 9 volt battery and uses two high powered LED lights.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  To carry in your pocket, car, garage and home.
[29:31.000 --> 29:36.000]  The pack light can survive severe impact, be frozen solid and still work flawlessly.
[29:36.000 --> 29:42.000]  The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker magazine.
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  The pack light comes with a 25 year warranty and prices started just $12.99.
[29:47.000 --> 29:54.000]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlight.com.

[30:03.000 --> 30:08.000]  That's 877-715-4448.
[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[30:13.000 --> 30:18.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[30:18.000 --> 30:24.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[30:27.000 --> 30:37.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[30:43.000 --> 30:47.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  It's a great progress for the world government.
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  That's their after-easy.

[32:19.000 --> 32:25.000]  Every move you make, every breath you take, the surveillance blimps will be watching you.
[32:25.000 --> 32:30.000]  And if you say you don't want Homeland Security doing it, they'll just say,
[32:30.000 --> 32:36.000]  shut up, it's an alien.
[32:36.000 --> 32:46.000]  And the public will probably buy it.
[32:46.000 --> 32:52.000]  The National Reconnaissance Office and the NSA will be watching you.
[32:52.000 --> 33:11.000]  Land of the free, home of the brave, high-tech enslavement grid.
[33:11.000 --> 33:15.000]  I mean, how obvious does all this tyranny have to get before the people rebel
[33:15.000 --> 33:20.000]  and say no to the national security state that is absolutely running wild
[33:20.000 --> 33:27.000]  and waging war and the infowar and physical war against the people of the planet?
[33:27.000 --> 33:36.000]  We outnumber them a million to one. It's time to say no to the superclass, the super maggots,
[33:36.000 --> 33:43.000]  the alpha maggots, the control freaks that make up the guild, the crime syndicate
[33:43.000 --> 33:53.000]  known as the New World Order.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  Charts predict that S&P may rally 20% and then fall.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  The S&P 500 could rally 20% in the first quarter of this year,
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  but investors shouldn't get used to the gains.
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  In 09 will be another year of losses for major indexes.
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.000]  Robin Griffin's technical strategist for Casanova Capital told CNBC,
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  and that's exactly what Bob Chapman and other financial experts we have on are saying,
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  the market tips, Dow could rally to 10,000,
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  but MSNBC goes on to say they believe it will then fall after that, another report.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  Government aid could save U.S. newspapers, spark debate.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  That's right, federal government wants to take over newspapers.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  Oh, I guess that's freedom.
[34:33.000 --> 34:38.000]  They already spend billions a year buying up and controlling all the fake newspapers in Iraq.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  They're already paying off most of the reporters.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  Why not just have it be openly run by the government?
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  Then if you say, hey, Reuters says the government wants to buy up the newspapers,
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  they'll say no, no, no.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  That wasn't the government buying up newspapers.
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  That was a flying saucer that did it.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  This is so ridiculous.
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.000]  International Herald Tribune, U.S. commercial property in a downward spiral,
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  and it is in a downward spiral,
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  but the public still living in La La Land says, don't be so negative.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  You're causing all of this.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  Well, the bankers are the ones that caused it.
[35:15.000 --> 35:16.000]  And it is true.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  The public is getting wise to at least one level of the deception.
[35:19.000 --> 35:23.000]  Yes, the media is hyping the implosion because now it's time to do that.
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  Treasury to Mole CityStyle rescues AP reports for hundreds of other troubled institutions.
[35:29.000 --> 35:35.000]  Translate that big private central banks engorged on tens of trillions of dollars worldwide
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  out of the treasuries of the planet, not just the U.S., but Germany, England, Japan,
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  France, on and on and on, are set to buy up all the rest of the banks.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  And how are they going to tax you?
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  There's a flotilla of taxing news as Obama's arrival in D.C. approaches as the savior,
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  and we have Republican and Democratic pundits saying, don't challenge him
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  or you'll cause a deeper depression, more financial terrorism.
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  You've just got to do what he says or it's all over.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  EPA Cal tax could charge 175 per dairy cow to curb greenhouse gases.
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  Now, some of the Obama crowd have proposed this.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  Some of the state agencies have proposed it.
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  But now, Business and Media Institute got a copy of the latest recommendation
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  by the federal government, epa.gov.
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.000]  They have the PDF file and it says they will tax all greenhouse emissions,
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  $175 per cow.
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  They will tax the chickens, the pigs, but that's not the issue.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  The taxing's bad enough.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  It's the control.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's the bureaucracy.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  It's the national premises registration.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  It's the national animal ID.
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  It's the control.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  It's the bureaucracy.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  And if you think $175 per head is a big tax and it is, they're going to ratchet that up.
[36:52.000 --> 36:59.000]  And they admit that the $175 per head, and what is it, $75 per pig and $10 per chicken,
[36:59.000 --> 37:06.000]  to start off will be used to build the bureaucracy to then create all the other regulations.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  See, this is just going to be a cap and trade or a carbon tax paid to the private banks,
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  which they've openly announced.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  It's all these other thousands of taxes over every facet of your life.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  And there won't be any real jobs.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  So people are going to have jobs as bureaucrats enforcing it.
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.000]  Every loser, no good control freak is going to get a federal government or local enforcement job.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  Heaven help us.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  Obama targets tax cuts for more than $300 billion, which is a chicken feed,
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.000]  but then wants to erect a new gas tax increase and all these other taxes.
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.000]  So tens of trillions for the bankers, $300 billion for the people.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  A couple hundred bucks apiece.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  Obama is losing a battle he doesn't know he's in.
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  There's a story out of the London Guardian and that's coming up later saying,
[37:52.000 --> 37:55.000]  oh, Obama doesn't know it, but by not saying anything about Gaza,
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  the whole world thought he was this big peacenik and now they're all getting upset and he's losing credibility.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  Well, of course, he's going to betray everybody.
[38:02.000 --> 38:03.000]  That's what he does.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  He's already done that on every other issue.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  So we're going to get into that.
[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  And to put it, uranium found in Gaza victims.
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  It's all over the foreign press.
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  And a great story by Michael Chassadowski, professor, all very accurate.
[38:15.000 --> 38:18.000]  He just has the quotes of the Israeli news,
[38:18.000 --> 38:26.000]  where they admit this was all preplanned and it's meant to finally drive the people out of Gaza.
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  And they say it's part of the 48 plan used to drive the Arabs out of Jerusalem and other cities,
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  like Tel Aviv that was used.
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.000]  So it's funny, our media that's controlled tells us, oh, it was because of rockets
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  and the Palestinians fired first when it's admitted they didn't.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  And Israel's just defending itself.
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  Meanwhile, in the Israeli papers, they just admit, oh, we're just kicking them out.
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.000]  They're just going to torture them and starve them until they all agree to leave.
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.000]  So that is coming up as well.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  But right now, let's go to your calls without further ado.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  Bryant in New Jersey, you're on the year.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  I'm okay.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  I'm better than folks in Gaza.
[39:09.000 --> 39:22.000]  I want to make a thing to you because I was at my school and I was heading into the script.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  Don't be so nervous.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  Don't listen. Relax.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  Just go ahead and get it out.
[39:28.000 --> 39:37.000]  And they told me that I knew my vaccine shots and it was interesting because I knew how you say that
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  and it's not mandatory.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  And at that point, I wasn't sure what to do.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  So I had to come back home and now I have to show them my records.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  We don't have to show them anything.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  They're just lying and saying there's a law.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  There is no law.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  I've gone over this a thousand times.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  You may have missed it.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  It's very simple.
[39:58.000 --> 40:05.000]  They will kick you out of school claiming it's a policy and then trigger criminal charges for truancy.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  So it's all a trick.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  You have to explain.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  I know you have the vaccine waiver, which is a waiver to something that isn't even a law.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  So that's another level of fraud.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  But if you want to give in to the waiver, just say give me the waiver or your county health department will have it.
[40:18.000 --> 40:27.000]  You simply get that waiver and then you give it to them and you say, if you falsely kick me out of school and then claim truancy,
[40:27.000 --> 40:36.000]  that is color of law that is racketeering, that is fraud and an attempt to get your federal matching funds for inoculation.
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.000]  They get money for inoculating you so they're lying to tell you it's the law.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  Wow.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  I appreciate your call, Bryant.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrea in Oklahoma.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  Welcome.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  Hello.
[40:58.000 --> 41:06.000]  My point is with a bully that's taking your lunch money and you beg them, don't take my lunch money.
[41:06.000 --> 41:12.000]  And they will continue to take your lunch money the next day and the next day.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  And then soon they want your backpack.
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  That's right.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  And then they want to beat you up and that's what government and tyranny is and they're just not going to stop.
[41:20.000 --> 41:26.000]  The thing is, Alex, and God bless you for being there and thank you for your passion.
[41:26.000 --> 41:34.000]  I listen to you and I'm amazed at your energy and you're a blessing to us all.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  The thing I'm doing is I hold up a sign at lunch.
[41:38.000 --> 41:46.000]  I go out to the busiest corner which is here in Oklahoma City and I hold up your station and most of them cannot get your station
[41:46.000 --> 41:55.000]  because some can, I guess, if I can get one that can listen to your station and it's the busiest freeway.
[41:55.000 --> 42:03.000]  Well, the best thing to do if you're listening to a local AMR FM station that's out of the area but comes partially into the city
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.000]  is drive to an area where it's coming in better and hold up the sign there.
[42:07.000 --> 42:13.000]  It's coming in better there but I still have people that are sitting in traffic trying to tune into it and they go,
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.000]  they can't pick it up but I had, if I can reach anybody, but the thing is, my gosh,
[42:18.000 --> 42:27.000]  we've got to do more than just get the word out because the bully is coming back every day and it's getting worse every day
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  as you know with the poison in the food, the fluoride, and they know we're going to rebel
[42:32.000 --> 42:40.000]  so that's why they've set up the police state in premeditated anticipation of our resistance.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  The thing is, if you knew that somebody had busted in your house and they were going to steal you blind
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  and then they were going to take your life, wouldn't you try and just go ahead and try and grab the gun
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.000]  and fight them to do everything you can because if they're going to go ahead and release a bomb somewhere,
[42:59.000 --> 43:06.000]  we've got to resist somehow. I mean, I know we want to do it peacefully but they're not going to be peaceful.
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  They're going to continue with what they're doing until you know what you said, get rid of 80% of us.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  I hear you and I appreciate your call. I'll plug the station and the frequency you're listening to.
[43:17.000 --> 43:25.000]  The only thing I can get here is 107.1 and it's not a station, it's coming right out of Austin.
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  Yeah, that's a micro. Good folks. That's Radio Free Oklahoma. And again, give folks the frequency.
[43:31.000 --> 43:38.000]  It's 107.1 and I think it's coming right out of Austin, Texas. I think we're able to get your frequency here.
[43:38.000 --> 43:45.000]  All right. I appreciate your call. Now, what you've got is somebody there locally picking it up off the feed
[43:45.000 --> 43:52.000]  and putting it out. I don't really know the details but thank you. Listen, the problem, people keep asking,
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  why do we have to educate the public? Because the public knows the government's evil and corrupt.
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.000]  They don't know it's a private offshore corporation now that we've had a corporate takeover of the country
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.000]  and the troops and militarized police don't even know they're part of a receivership arm.
[44:06.000 --> 44:15.000]  That's why we have to get the word out for them, to them, so that they see the big picture.
[44:15.000 --> 44:21.000]  The general public knows they're being lied to. They just don't have all the dots connected.
[44:21.000 --> 44:27.000]  And so we have to point out the dots and get people to step back and see the larger picture.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  We don't – I mean, you say start shooting and you're asking that question.
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  The average police officer doesn't know what's going on. Most of them aren't bullies.
[44:36.000 --> 44:42.000]  Most of them aren't thugs but their bosses are giving them orders that are tyrannical, that are abusive
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  and they've incrementally trained them to violate rights and they give them all these excuses for why they're violating rights
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.000]  or having warrantless checkpoints or working with the Marines or army at checkpoints.
[44:51.000 --> 44:56.000]  But now the New World Order is finally going public. It's finally moving into its final takeover phase.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  So this is a very critical time for the globalists and for us that are fighting them
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.000]  because now they have uncloked themselves. Now they're emerging. Now they're admitting,
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  okay, it's a world government but it's for your own good.
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  We need to go, wait a minute, you lied all these years and said you weren't setting one up.
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  Now you admit you're doing it and you admit it's going to be run by private central banks
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.000]  and we'll pay carbon taxes on all our activities every facet of our lives to you
[45:20.000 --> 45:25.000]  and you'll have bureaucrats that micromanage our entire lives and carry out one-child policy and eugenics
[45:25.000 --> 45:29.000]  and you think the CPS kidnapping is bad now, you think the checkpoints are bad now,
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  you think the micromanagement is bad now, it's growing.
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.000]  I'm getting all these emails going, oh my gosh, you know, I put my child in head start thinking it'd be a good free day care.
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  You know, I'm lower middle class and you're right, I get CPS visits now and they're trying to take my children.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  Absolutely, it's a trap. Nothing the government offers you is to help you.
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.000]  Look at all the quote, help they gave blacks in the 60s and 70s.
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.000]  They went from 90 plus percent legitimacy in their births to over 90 percent illegitimate.
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.000]  They went from what, one out of ten black males ending up in prison to now eight out of ten black males
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.000]  end up with felony convictions in their lifetime. They institutionalize you.
[46:09.000 --> 46:16.000]  This is for everybody. They just beta tested it on weaker groups that were under greater control
[46:16.000 --> 46:23.000]  where it was more societally acceptable to allow corruption and abuse against the people.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  You want to see what's going to happen in every area of the country.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  I don't care if you have white flight to the suburbs or the countryside, it's coming.
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  You go see how black people in the inner cities live or how poor whites live
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  and then you're going to know the face of it all.
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  Look, look at what the government does. I don't even call the government this criminal thing
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  does when it has foster children under its control.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  Nationwide average, 67 percent of foster children. You can Google that.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  That number's about two years old. I haven't checked it. I know the number's gone up.
[46:53.000 --> 47:01.000]  There's over 100 million Prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[47:01.000 --> 47:08.000]  I saw that number in the Austin Market Statesman last week in 2008. Over 100 million prescriptions
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  for one class, the SSRIs.
[47:12.000 --> 47:17.000]  I mean, is that a free society? 100 million people on a psychotropic drug
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  that puts you into a mesmerized, hypnotized dream state?
[47:20.000 --> 47:29.000]  I mean, that's what the drug insert says it does, causes psychotic breaks, causes suicidal tendencies.
[47:29.000 --> 47:38.000]  100 million people out of 300 million and growing.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  See, last time I had a number, it was 20 percent were on the drugs.
[47:42.000 --> 47:49.000]  That number's a couple years old. The new numbers is over 30 percent.
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  And when they've got you captured, it's over two thirds.
[47:53.000 --> 48:00.000]  67 percent.
[48:00.000 --> 48:09.000]  67 percent of the children they grab they put on drugs because then it's all tailored
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.000]  because when a foster parent or an orphanage puts a child on a drug,
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  there are now special needs and they get double, triple quadruple the money.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  So the average foster child who is on drugs is on seven.
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  Mind-altering, mind-bending drugs.
[48:24.000 --> 48:27.000]  Let's talk to Curt in Texas. Curt, you're on the air.
[48:27.000 --> 48:35.000]  Yes, Alex. In our town, through public opposition, we were able to curb some of the spread
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  of these red light cameras.
[48:38.000 --> 48:41.000]  Well, you know what? I have thought all week.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  I'm trying to finish this Obama film to 100 other things, but I want to go out
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.000]  and have a protest at the red light cameras they've got right down by the police station.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  They're all over town because state courts have ruled they're illegal,
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  just like they've ruled in California that, and they're not removing them.
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  In Austin's, other cities have, Austin says we don't care if it's illegal.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  I mean, those are illegal. You know why? No due process.
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  There is not a sworn peace officer that's had the training and sworn
[49:08.000 --> 49:11.000]  and has a bond and an oath of office as a witness.
[49:11.000 --> 49:14.000]  There's no judge or jury, no due process, no chance to challenge.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  A private company mails you a ticket.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  So that's one reason the Texas courts said they're all illegal.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  The second reason was the main company doing it in Texas,
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  one company has over 80% of the contracts, I have the Austin News reports,
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  they say that they're not even going to get the permit
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  because there's a permit you have to get on top of it under state law.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  They just, they're lawless. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[49:36.000 --> 49:42.000]  But the police state marches, some time back ago,
[49:42.000 --> 49:48.000]  we had a fellow five to eight miles from where I live,
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.000]  that went a little bit psycho and started shooting out onto the street
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  and the telephone rang.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  Stay there. I want to hear about this when we come back.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  Don't hang up, Kurt.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Then Brent, John, Mike, Rob and others.
[50:00.000 --> 50:12.000]  I'm Alex Jones, you have found it, the front lines of the Info War.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  It's free shipping. You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.

[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  This is one of the finest, most affordable seed offers that is on the market today.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  Variety in your garden means a diverse and healthy diet for your family year round.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  So go to GetSeeds.net or call 1-877-394-6657.

[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[51:18.000 --> 51:19.000]  But who is the enemy?
[51:19.000 --> 51:20.000]  Bin Laden.
[51:20.000 --> 51:21.000]  This is his MO.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  the American war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[51:53.000 --> 51:54.000]  Fabled Enemies.

[52:09.000 --> 52:13.000]  Fuel prices are up and down, biting into everyone's budget.

[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  we're here.
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  By the way, if you're listening on the M&M dial,
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  Global SportWave Satellite, the Internet,
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  or watching us on a YouTube clip,
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  don't forget the free podcast at infowars.com.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  Just go to the Listen page, copy the code
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  into your MP3 or iPod or computer,
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  listen to the show, How You Want, When You Want,
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  Where You Want, and save the shows.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  We now have a complete archive daily posted as well.
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  If you don't want the podcast, you can just go click on the stream,
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.000]  or download it. It's all at infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  Inside issue, I want to go back to the caller.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  Later on, we'll talk about the incredible success
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  we're having on YouTube despite all their censorship.
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  They block us, people being able to give our videos thumbs up.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  They, you know, will have the number one video,
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  but they'll give us the number two or three video.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  And it's not just the Alex Jones channel
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  that we're moving into taking over,
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  working with a guy that started it today,
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  doing a great job.
[54:02.000 --> 54:03.000]  It's all these other channels,
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  like Puppet Government and others,
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  are just getting record hits.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  Robert Wannick, the 14-year-old,
[54:10.000 --> 54:15.000]  he has five videos that have between 70
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  and 100,000 views apiece in the last two days,
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  videos of this show.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  I mean, think about that.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  He's 14 years old.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  Is it four or five or six?
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.000]  I think it's more like six videos.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  You can go pull it up, go to his page.
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.000]  Robert Wannick's page, and, I mean,
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  by the end of the week,
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  it's going to be millions of views the way it's going,
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  and the videos are number one on YouTube.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  I mean, we are having a huge effect in the Info War.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  Folks, we do not want to go out and start shooting people.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  That is exactly what the globalists want.
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  Why do they have to hire cops in Denver?
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  Denver Post headlined the police admit it
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  to attack other police in front of the news cameras
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  and to attack other police.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  In front of the news cameras to demonize the protesters
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  so they can attack the general public
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  and try to create a chilling effect
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  against the First Amendment and freedom of assembly.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  Why have they been caught in Greece doing it?
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  Why have they been caught in Canada?
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  Why have they been caught in England?
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Because they want to demonize.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  And it is criminal.
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.000]  It is horrible.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  It freaks me out about the police.
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  I want to believe in them.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  I want to believe they're not directed by evil,
[55:19.000 --> 55:20.000]  but that proves they are.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  Does that mean every officer is evil?
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  No.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  So we've got a chance here, folks, to...
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  I mean, if just this radio show
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  is reaching millions and millions of new people every week,
[55:32.000 --> 55:38.000]  we're just one little outpost in the fight.
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  And it's growing exponentially, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  It is so exciting.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  I was counting it up.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  The Alex Jones channel, on average,
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  which is just one YouTube channel,
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  there's a whole bunch that posts my stuff,
[55:50.000 --> 55:58.000]  is getting around 800,000 views a week now.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  I mean, those aren't hits.
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  Those are unique visits.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  I mean, I can't even keep track of all this anymore.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  We're number one on Shoutcast.
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  And less than half our streams are even registered on Shoutcast.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  We're trying to figure out how to get all our streams tied into that.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  Number one.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  Number one.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  I apologize, Kurt, for going off on the deep end on that.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  But I just want people to know the good news.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  We are exploding.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  The freedom message is just going supernova.
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  Keep it up.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  Kurt, finish up with what happens.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  This guy's out there going crazy in your area of Texas,
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  and then suddenly you get a phone call.
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  The streets.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  I live approximately five to eight miles from where this occurred.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  Me and all my neighbors are telephone rang,
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  and they told us we are declaring a red alert.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  Stay in your house.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  Do not go near the windows.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  Do not go outside.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  Do not open the doors until we tell you.
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  Yeah.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  Three hours later, they called and said,
[57:00.000 --> 57:03.000]  okay, everything's clear.
[57:03.000 --> 57:07.000]  No way him shooting five to eight miles away from me
[57:07.000 --> 57:11.000]  could have had any effect on my place.
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  I wrote a letter to the local paper pointing out
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  that this was the beginning of martial law,
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  and I was called on their blog site on that,
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  a radical, a crazy, one thing and another,
[57:25.000 --> 57:30.000]  a few threats, a fairly made on my life.
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  Real great.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  Kurt, stay there.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  We're going to come back in 70 seconds to start the second hour.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  I want you to tell us your town what's happening,
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  and I'm going to break down the larger picture.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  This is martial law, but it's meant to sound reasonable
[57:42.000 --> 57:45.000]  to the sheep and the police to condition them
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  in preparation for it.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  Stay with us.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[57:58.000 --> 58:01.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  that's for a lateral commission to see far?
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  Do we sit down and shout?
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  to grow at our own door.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  An inside job?
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  How dare you?
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  Oh, hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[58:44.000 --> 58:46.000]  And if the government has not told the truth,
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[58:49.000 --> 58:50.000]  Truth rises.
[58:50.000 --> 58:53.000]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[58:55.000 --> 59:10.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[59:25.000 --> 59:30.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[59:30.000 --> 59:33.000]  We are now into the second hour of this worldwide transmission.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  We're talking to Kurt in Texas.
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  Kurt, I want you to recap because you got interrupted by the break.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  Tell your whole story again,
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  and then I'm going to detail exactly how this feeds into
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  the whole martial law control grid
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  from the government's own documents
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  with what they're setting up.
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  They've been doing this quietly for decades.
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  The EAS, Amber Alert system,
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  it is for the general public to lock down
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  all U.S. cities and sectors,
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  just like the Gaza Strip is locked down right now.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  This is a total control grid.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  That's what they call it.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  It's Pentagon designed.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  And they're slowly brainwashing the police
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  who don't see the full picture
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  and the local communities to go along with this.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  So, break down from the beginning to the end.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  What happened?
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Okay, six to eight months ago,
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  a fellow went off the deep end.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  They said he was on some kind of drugs.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Took a shotgun and started firing into one of the main streets.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  I live five to eight miles from where this occurred.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Our telephone rang.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  They told us we are declaring a red alert
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  because of this condition.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  You are to stay in your house.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  You're not to go to your windows.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  You're not to open your doors.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  You're not to enter your car.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  You're not to limit your any phone calls to one minute
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  until we give you the all clear.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  I pointed this out to the local paper
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  that this was nothing more than the beginning of institution
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  of martial law on us.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  They posted it on their website.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  I was called a radical and not an idiot,
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  one thing and another.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  A few minor threats, failed threats made on my life
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  by people and so like that,
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  but that's just exactly what it is.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Okay, let me ask you a few questions.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  What is the name of the town you live in in Texas?
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Abilene, Texas.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  No, it will.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  That is a serious testing ground for globalist control.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  Okay, was it a live person that called you
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  or was it a recording?
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  Recording.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Okay, we're going on the line.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  That just confirmed 100% that this is a federally funded operation.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  This does confirm that this isn't some cowboys in your town mimicking
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  your local and stabulary mimicking programs,
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  the fact that it was recorded.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  It was a computerized voice, yes.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Yes, okay.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  That's under FEMA.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  All right, let me ask you a few other key questions.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  Was this the only call you've ever gotten?
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  Yes, so far.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  They told us at this time that when we were to stay in our homes
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  that there would be SWAT teams on the street.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Yes.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  SWAT teams for one man with a rival.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  That's quite much in my opinion.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Well, this is a very sophisticated psychological warfare
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  and most of the officers there probably don't even have
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  the slightest understanding of what they're dealing with.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  But when we come back from break, I am going to break down
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  exactly what we're dealing with here.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  Any other points you'd like to make?
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  No, I've been trying to get your videos out.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  I'm not able to walk out and meet and distribute them myself.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  So I have two or three other people that are passing them out.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  I'm doing the duplicating and passing them to them to pass out.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  That's how we're going to defeat the enemy, sir.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  What you're doing will defeat them in the end
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  and they're attempted, again, foreign banking takeover.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  It's all engineered.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  They set up this receivership, the police state,
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  knowing they were going to purposefully implode the economy.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And now, I don't know how long you've been listening,
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  but everything we laid out, how they would engineer it,
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  how they would lay out the subprime crisis,
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  how they would then openly announce the foreign banks,
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  we're going to take over the planet, how we would pay taxes to them.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  Have you not seen all of that happen?
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Yes, I have.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  And I think this thing over in Lebanon is a war of convenience
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  because I feel the unpopular thing that they are talking about
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  after his inauguration is for him to say,
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  well, I think we should...
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Stay there, stay there.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  will slash your life savings to nothing
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  and blast the cost of necessities,
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation,
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  The private banks merging with our government
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  to restock their shelves.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  The stores have less food but jack of prices
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  to stay in business.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  Whatever happens in America,
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  we need to be prepared and be ready.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  and paying for other necessities.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared,
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  get self-sufficient, get food.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  For everybody out there listening,
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  it's very important for you to understand
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  that by having a supply of storable food,
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  and so it's a mindset,
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  a set of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  No one is going to take care of your family
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  in the final equation but you.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  and they do it at almost half the cost
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  of last year's grocery prices.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633

[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  Again, 800-409-5633
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  Take action today.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  deep behind enemy lines,
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  the information war continues.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  To defeat an enemy, you have to first realize
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  that there is an enemy.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Private foreign banks since 1913
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  have fully taken over the United States.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  They are now attempting to fully bankrupt
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  the people and leave us homeless
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  on the continent our forefathers conquered.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  And we are here at the gates.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  I want to briefly break down
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  this whole martial law control grid
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  from the angle that Kurt in Texas
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  was just telling us about.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  I believe his story,
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  because I've seen him do it in Austin many times.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  I've seen them do it in many other small towns
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  with their beta testing,
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  and it's easier to do it in small towns.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  And I want to walk through what the feds admit
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  they have covertly set up.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  The first time we saw documents dealing with this
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  was the late 1980s.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  1988 in North Carolina and South Carolina.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  They first began this.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  I want to give a brief history of it
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  as soon as Kurt leaves us.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  But Kurt, finish up your point
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  about Obama's unpopular move,
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  January 21st,
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  and what you believe that is going to be.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  I think it's to commit U.S. troops
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  to the Middle East between Israel and Palestine.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  There's a lot of people that do not like
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  the U.S. involvement with Israel
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  because we are giving them more.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  We're giving them what would average out
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  about $30,000 per person in Israel
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  a year in foreign aid.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  And that's just what we know of.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  That's just what we know of.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  That's just the aid that is public.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Absolutely, sir, I appreciate your call,
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  and I believe that that is a very strong possibility.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  There was big calls in 2006
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  to put a United Nations U.S. back.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  It'll be a U.N. operation,
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  but predominantly made up of U.S. forces
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  in Lebanon.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  And now, in fact, that's in my stack of news here,
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  some of the Israeli documents are coming out
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  in the Israeli press,
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  and that is indeed what they are planning
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  to create a giant crisis,
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  and they may even attack Lebanon again
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  and then put United Nations slash NATO troops
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  in the north on the Lebanon northern Israel border
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  and there in the south into the Gaza territory.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And then you see, after weeks and weeks
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  or months of bombing
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  and siege and starvation,
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  the Gazans will beg for the United Nations
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  to come in as their supposed savior,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  and then the United Nations occupation
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  will be used as a conduit
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  for Palestinians that want to flee and leave,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  and that's the Israeli objective,
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  according to Israeli papers,
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  is to make it so untenable
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  that the Palestinians will flee,
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  not just there in the Gaza Strip,
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  but also in the north.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  So that is definitely,
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  definitely an excellent point made by Kurt.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Okay, let me get into what's really going on.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Starting with Columbine,
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  which was clearly an engineered operation.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  The school was half empty that day.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  Harrison Clybold had talked about how they were going to shoot everybody.
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  They'd been under psychiatric government care.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  They were both on serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  and one of them was also on a Roodland-type drug.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  The sheriff and the principal
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  sat there for an hour at a subway while it all went on.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  100 and 27 unexploded bombs,
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  some of them weighing hundreds of pounds
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  were in the building, but something didn't go off.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  They had to replace 120-plus bombs in the building.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  On and on and on, but I don't want to get sidetracked.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  I say a brief explanation.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  This is just so detailed.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  They used that event to turn the schools into prisons,
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  to put up barbed wire fences,
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  metal detectors, what they'd already done in the inner city,
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  to roll that out nationwide, ID cards.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  If children wrote about anything violent in their school essays,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  they'd be arrested, now violating the First Amendment,
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  all these zero-tolerance laws.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And then now they're going to move that model
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and are moving that model through the fusion centers,
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  the emergency management centers.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  In rural areas, it'll be over a four or five-county area,
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  federally paid for.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  They're even merging the National Guard
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  into the same buildings with their armories,
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  although they're having the cities and counties move in,
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  having their main police command centers
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  for multiple towns and cities, for regional government,
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  into the command centers.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Then the face-scanning cameras,
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  the cell phone tracking software,
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  the license plate reading systems are now all integrated into those.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  Then the feds every few months tell the local emergency managers
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  new aspects of the control grid
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  and give them new phony reasons for why it's all happening.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Again, so it all sounds good.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Kind of like 10 years ago,
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  hey, UN troops are helping put out forest fires out west.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Now we're hearing, oh, NATO and UN,
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  and British and Canadian and Mexican troops
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  are going to help during riots in America.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  And it's in major US and Canadian papers.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  See, the police and firemen and others
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  were acclimated working with foreign troops
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  to put out fires or Mexican troops
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  helping with soup kitchens in Katrina.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  But making a big deal about armored convoys
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  pouring across the border,
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  flying giant Mexican flags and the news saying,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  since the first time, since the 1880s,
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  Mexican troops are in the United States.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  And there's thousands of points to integrate into this.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  People ask, well, how do you have your opinion or your view?
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  It isn't that.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  When you constantly study this,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  thousands of points of data that integrate in together
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  and to even try to give you a data briefing on it
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  would probably take the next three hours.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  But I'm going to try to abbreviate.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Now, the reason I asked him if it was a recorded call,
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  that shows that it is a set-up system,
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  the same one we've seen the feds implementing
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  as they federalize local communities all over the country
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  with these different task forces.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  So they have emergency anti-terror planning
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  under Homeland Security, under the emergency alert system
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  set up in 96, but announced to the public after 9-11.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  They roll it out in the name of amber,
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  you know, saving a little girl.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  But if you read the real EAS system,
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  it isn't about floods, it isn't about storms.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  When you hear them take over the local feeds,
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  it is about FEMA and the local emergency management command
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  bunkers, the fusion centers in the future.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Well, they're already doing it, flashing up on billboards.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  Look for this fugitive, video jumbotrons.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  Report terrorism, 1-800 numbers.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Report illegal guns, 1-800 numbers.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  See, they're already using the FEMA system on major highways.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  First, it's, oh, look for the little girl.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  Remember, I told you a decade ago.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  First, it's look for the little girl.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Oh, you're saving little girls.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  And then now it's, oh, we're looking for terrorists.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  We're looking for gun owners.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  But they've got to acclimate the public,
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  just like they raid schools for drills.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Don't tell the children it's a drill.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Put guns in their heads.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Teach them learned helplessness.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Terrorize them to submit, to load on the FEMA buses,
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  to go to the local sports stadium.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  They had those drills all over the country.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Now it's time for the public to go through this.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  And so they just set up giant, there was some drug dealers
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  that were shot at some police.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  So they locked down a large part of East Austin,
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  evacuated scores of schools, or locked the schools down,
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  told people don't come out of their houses.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  And this went on for hours after hours after they'd already
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  shot one of the guys and captured them.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  So again, in the past, they didn't do that.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  Now they call you and say, stay in your homes,
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  don't leave, or you'll basically be shot.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  Now in 88, the federal government wanted it,
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  were all cable systems, all radio, all TV,
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  were hooked in to local federal feeds,
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  or international or national feeds.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  The president can come on and talk to everybody
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  and take over, or it can be the locals just regionally.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  And they tried to pass a federal law then that by 1990,
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  everything would be remote controlled.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  But they didn't get it until 1996.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And so now they're training you with more and more break-ins
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  about floods or about ice.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  Oh, they care about me or about bad traffic.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And now the FCC has told AM and FM stations
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  as of four years ago, and I saw the internal memos.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  Because at the time I was doing a show at 1260 AM,
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  I would also go over there and fill in for them here in Austin.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  And we'll just to finish up the basics on that front.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  The FCC said, get ready in the next few years.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  We're going to start taking maybe an hour or two a day of programming.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  And we're not even going to tell you when.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  We're just going to take over with public service announcements and things.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  And so they're getting you ready for that as well.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Just like the feds are saying they're going to start taking over the newspapers.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  So forget just placing their propaganda in the news.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  They're talking about openly running it and taking it over
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  and doing whatever they want whenever they want.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  And so you get a call and it tells you don't leave your house.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Don't use your telephone.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  Do as we say.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  It sets the precedent that you're literally a prisoner.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  That you have no First Amendment.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  That you have no right to travel.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Then they're acclimating.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Oh, the Marines are here to help at a checkpoint looking for drunks.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  You're not for drunks, are you?
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  Oh, the Army's here to help look for drunks.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  You're not for drunks, are you?
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  And then when you read the actual documents, they say we're getting the public ready
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  for the troops to engage the American people, Army War College,
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  official Defense Department policy.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  Northcom has the United States as a war zone.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  Just like CENTCOM has the Middle East.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Just like Southcom has Latin America.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  I mean, we are a theater of operations.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  But the key is the red alert and the recorded message.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  That is the key here, the red alert and the recorded message.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Because they're letting you know this is a red alert.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  And notice it's a guy out shooting with a gun.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Why do they have all the major towns and cities in the country under federal grants
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  and tracking with the Army and bomb disposal and preparing for IED attack?
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  Well, that's a nice excuse to get the Army involved in every community
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  to create that relationship and to train the police to look for terrorists everywhere.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  But then when you read, as I put in my film, Police State 2000,
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  Police State 2000 to the takeover, Police State 3 total enslavement road to tyranny.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  Going back to the late nineties, I explained at the front
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:18.200]  in covert operations in the United States against the American people, is the bomb disposal
[1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:22.800]  team. But they're only what the press has told about. Now that's all admitted. Of course,
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:27.480]  we got secret documents because an FBI agent screwed up and said, here's the press release.
[1:17:27.480 --> 1:17:31.680]  And it was the press release stapled on top of an internal, not for circulation document
[1:17:31.680 --> 1:17:35.640]  that's in police state to the takeover. And it says we're in secret operations in seven
[1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:41.840]  to seven counties. We do raids on homes. The army is here 24 hours a day, seven days
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:48.640]  a week. See covert illegal US Army. And then we even have a Marine on video again with the
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:54.000]  documents explaining that in the late 80s in Virginia, they were doing gun raids, the US
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:59.120]  Marine Corps with police secretly. See, they've created these secret relationships. Now they
[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:03.180]  need to condition the public to accept all this. So they say, Oh, there's a mad gunman
[1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:07.160]  stay in your house. This is a red alert lockdown. Don't leave your home. It's all part of getting
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:10.560]  you ready for martial law. So when they're arresting your neighbors, they tell you to
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:16.960]  stay in your house and then you do it. Well, they ride buck.
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:22.440]  Every 22 seconds of violent crime is committed. Are you concerned about your personal safety?

[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:25.440]  dwindle away? As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating
[1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:30.320]  in excess of 20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard earned
[1:19:30.320 --> 1:19:36.400]  money? Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987? Too many of today's policies resemble
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:42.480]  those that led to the collapse of 1929. How much are you willing to lose? Take action now. Call me

[1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:56.720]  And I know I said I'm gonna take a lot of calls when I spent 20 minutes with Kurt because his
[1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:00.800]  information was just too vital and I wanted to break down. That is indeed happening and that's
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:05.360]  how this slow creeping death, similar to how special forces take over third-world countries
[1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:11.200]  and their governments, was going on right down the United States. They're well-trained hands at this,
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:15.200]  but remember the brainwashing is more intense against the troops and the police.
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:20.720]  They're only incrementally told about it. Remember Congress is now under War Powers
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:25.680]  Public Martial Law Bloomberg AP. This is all being calmly announced because now they're
[1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:30.000]  moving into the final phase. They've got to admit it so it looks mainstream for the FBI and the
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:35.360]  police who are questioning, well, you know, just the foreign banks on us now. Okay, we're defending
[1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:39.440]  America. Let's take a few more calls. Brent in Washington. Brent, you're on the air.
[1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:45.360]  Alex, hey, good to have you out there. You're doing an awesome job.
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:48.240]  I try. There's just too much info.
[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:57.040]  Hey, this morning on CNBC, I was watching SquawkBox and they were interviewing Henry Kissinger
[1:23:57.040 --> 1:24:04.080]  and they asked him about Israel and the conflict. And anyways, he came up and said
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:08.960]  that this is the perfect time for Obama to create a new world order.
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:17.680]  Who said that? Henry Kissinger on SquawkBox. Henry Kissinger on SquawkBox. Well, I mean,
[1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:23.200]  they're constantly, look, hundreds of newspapers a week are saying, world government's good,
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:27.680]  world government will save you. We shut it up for your own good. And then I post links to the
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:33.920]  stories on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. We do. And then they go in under the stories
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:38.720]  and say, you're lying. This isn't real. And they've got to be disinfo operatives. I mean,
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:42.960]  how are they denying AP Reuters financial times of London? They're just flaunting it.
[1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:49.760]  It's crazy. It almost fell off my feet when he said I had to rewind it to make sure I heard what
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:57.600]  I heard. But certainly, they're not hiding anything. Well, they're hiding the fact that
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:25:03.280]  they engineered the crises. But I'm going to cover after the break what's really happening in Israel.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:11.360]  The invasion of Gaza, Operation Cass led as part of a broader Israeli military intelligence agenda.
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:16.400]  And then the story from global research that we have posted by Professor Chasadosky of International
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:22.560]  Affairs, he just gives all their own admissions. This is out of Herat's or Herit's. I mean,
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:26.960]  it's all there. They are staging all of this and then admitting it.
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:36.720]  Yeah. Hey, Alex, I did have one question for you. What is there? What was significant? Why did
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:44.080]  they choose the date of September 11 to orchestrate the attacks? You can get into all of the bizarre
[1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:49.680]  numerology that the elite is obsessed with. I mean, you know, Ronald Reagan would only give
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:54.080]  speeches at a certain minute, certain day, according to his astrologer. And of course,
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:58.960]  that's just the light end of it. You have Bohemian Grove. You have Tony Blair admittedly doing
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:03.760]  rituals every morning saying he's possessed by the spirit of white light and he falls on the ground
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:07.520]  and flops around. I mean, you can't make this up, folks. If you don't believe me, just Google it.
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:14.400]  It's all over the British papers. They're just a bunch of lunatics and they don't worship the
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:21.280]  same God as most of us. Yeah. Well, I've been doing a lot of research on specialists in the
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:27.760]  markets and some of the movements that, you know, the internals of the markets. And it's interesting
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:33.280]  how specialists leave signs or signals about when they're going to move the market up or down.
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:43.760]  And I've been doing some charting anyways. One of the big signs on the charting has come to about
[1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:49.920]  April 15th. So I was just, you know, I'm trying to figure out if that is significant in any way,
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:54.800]  if that's going to be. Well, I know a lot of top financial experts from a wide range that we interview
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:27:00.240]  say that April May is when they believe things will start plunging again. And I've got MSNBC
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:04.800]  saying they think in January, February, March, that's going to go up and then in April and May
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:09.360]  it's going to go back down. Who knows? They could be saying that through us a curveball. Who knows?
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:16.080]  We will certainly find out. Well, I actually think we're going to hit 12,000 on the Dow
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:22.640]  sometime by the end of April. To get the suckers confidence again before they really hammer us.
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:27.760]  And that's exactly what's going to happen. There's going to be some significant,
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:32.160]  something significant happen between the end of April and May that's going to,
[1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:39.760]  that's going to cause the Dow go to, to go from 12,000 down to 6,000 or less within weeks.
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:44.640]  And then, then, you know, then all the people that still have their money in there is going to,
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:49.760]  they're going to lose the rest of their money. Absolutely. Great to hear from you. Appreciate

[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:22.320]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:28.640]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:33.520]  his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled enemies is

[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:43.360]  inside the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much
[1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:50.480]  engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:29:50.480 --> 1:29:55.680]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:29:55.680 --> 1:29:59.920]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,

[1:31:15.600 --> 1:31:34.960]  They don't want to see us unite. All they want us to do is keep on forcing and fighting. They
[1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:48.480]  don't want to see us live together. All they want us to do is keep on killing one another.
[1:31:48.480 --> 1:32:09.920]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. we're live on the radio and we simulcast
[1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:14.880]  sometimes the entire four-hour show but always the last hour. We're now live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:32:14.880 --> 1:32:21.120]  One and a half hours in to this worldwide transmission on the AM and FM dial, Global
[1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:30.800]  Shortwave Satellite and the Internet both audio and visual. At PrisonPlanet.tv and we do this because
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:38.640]  of our brotherly love. We do this because we know there's wicked, sadistic tyrants
[1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:47.920]  in control of the planet, the Anglo-American elite. All of us are under attack. Black, white,
[1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:57.360]  old, young, Hispanic, Asian, the North, the South, Christian, Muslim, Jew. In the final equation,
[1:32:57.360 --> 1:33:05.040]  the New World Order is waging war against the Hindu, against the Sunni, the Shiite,
[1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:18.720]  against the Sephardi. We are together and they don't want to see us unite. All they
[1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:36.400]  want to do is see us fuss and fight. All they want to see us do is go on killing one another.
[1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:47.440]  All right, let me tell you what's coming up in the next two hours and
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:55.440]  plus that we have left today. Two hours and 25 minutes. Dr. Russell Blalock joins us for the
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:34:01.520]  last hour and a half. Brain surgeon, neuroscientist, dealing with the toxins in our food and water by
[1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:08.320]  design, the eugenics agenda. He's one of the most prestigious in his field out there and
[1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:13.520]  we'll have his bio up on screen for you. That is coming up. We're going to be taking calls
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:19.920]  in the meantime and covering the news on a host of issues. I'm going to get into what's
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:25.120]  happening in Gaza right now, a clearly part of Obama's unpopular surprise that Joseph Biden
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:29.920]  and others promised the public. I'm then going to get into the fact that the right wing and the
[1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:33.280]  left wing are controlled by the same interest and they're bringing in their global carbon taxes
[1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:37.200]  and exactly what that's going to mean to the economy and society and Pat Robertson
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:41.040]  disgustingly pushing it and saying it's of the Lord kind of like he said forced abortion in China
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.120]  was something he didn't like, but they're doing what they had to do to tacit approval of that
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:53.280]  and Christians will attack me saying that how dare I not want to abort the Chinese babies now.
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:58.560]  It's kind of very twisted how things are working. So that's coming up and then I never get into UFOs,
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:04.720]  but I briefly want to get into Project Bluebeam some next hour because on Larry King Live and on
[1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:10.880]  ABC News and everywhere, people keep sending me emails going, my God, giant cigar-shaped craft of
[1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:16.080]  the UFOs, the aliens. They're over Albuquerque. They're over Dallas. They're over LA. They're
[1:35:16.080 --> 1:35:19.920]  over everywhere. They're going to get us and you see the video and it's a giant blimp,
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:23.920]  but the military won't admit what they're doing. And so the public thinks it's the
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:31.600]  media acts like it's aliens, little green aliens from Mars, folks. Again, I'm not poo-pooing that
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:37.520]  there might be some other life in the universe. I think that's of certainty. The issue here is the
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:42.080]  government admits, they always admit and they're in the planning stages 10 years ago, I made films
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:47.120]  about it, that they're going to put over every major city, drone blimps. I'm going to get into it
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:54.560]  later and you can see it. It is a blimp. These giant craft are blimps and it doesn't matter to the
[1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:59.600]  public because the media is telling them it's little green men. So we'll get into that. I mean,
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:02.960]  you know, I'm the cook because I don't believe they're little green men, but Larry King Live,
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:08.000]  that's that's good mainstream and it's aliens. So Pat Robertson's for abortion
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:14.480]  and mainstream media is saying aliens are real and I'm the weirdo because I'm saying that isn't
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:20.880]  very Christian conservative of Pat Robertson. It isn't very credible for the media. The media
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:24.400]  knows they're blimps, folks. They think you're complete idiots and they're just messing with
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:29.840]  you. Okay, let me go ahead and get to the Gaza situation. Punch up on screen this article, please.
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:37.200]  This is from Global Research. We have it posted up on infowars.com. We're going to get Professor
[1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:44.240]  Chastadosky on later. But what I like about his article from globalresearch.ca is that he lays
[1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:50.000]  out all the facts that we're aware of here and so that I can, I trust the professor, but I also
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.400]  verify. And so I'm already acutely aware of everything that's in his article, but I know a
[1:36:54.400 --> 1:36:58.800]  lot of the public aren't. Now, I'm not bringing that up to say, oh, I'm smart. I know about this.
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:04.800]  I'm saying this is accurate information. I have confirmed it for myself. Now, it is a lengthy
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:12.160]  article to say the least. Okay, so I am not going to have time on air today to read this all. But
[1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:17.600]  if you want to be informed and not just be lied to by the trolled corporate propagandist,
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.480]  you need to go to infowars.com and read this story and then link through to his site and read more
[1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:29.200]  there as well, previous articles. If you want to be informed. Now, let's go ahead and go over
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:35.360]  some of this article. Here we go. The invasion of Gaza, Operation Cast Lead, part of a broader
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:40.960]  Israeli military intelligence agenda. The aerial bombings and the ongoing ground invasion of Gaza
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:46.960]  by Israeli ground forces must be analyzed in a historical context. Operation Cast Lead is a
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:52.560]  carefully planned undertaking that is part of a broader military industrial agenda, first formulated
[1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:57.360]  by the government of the prime minister, Ariel Sharon in 2001. Sources in the defense establishment
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:04.000]  said defense minister Ahud Barak instructed the Israeli defense forces to prepare for the
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.080]  operation over six months ago, even as Israel was beginning to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:13.760]  Hamas. That is Barak Ravid, Operation Cast Lead, Israeli Air Force strikes followed months of
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:24.720]  planning, Haraj December 2007, 2008. Okay, so that is Haraj December 2007, 2008. It was Israel,
[1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:30.000]  which broke the trees only on the day of the U.S. presidential elections November 4th,
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  when everybody was distracted, kind of like U.S. NATO Israeli forces attack the Russians in
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  South Ossetia on 888 with the Olympics kicking off. They do it when people aren't looking.
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:46.000]  It's classic military operations. And again, he has link after link. Israel has used the
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.480]  distraction to break the ceasefire between itself and Hamas by bombing the Gaza Strip.
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:55.120]  Israel claimed this violation of the ceasefire was to prevent Hamas from digging tunnels into
[1:38:55.120 --> 1:39:00.560]  Israel territory. The very next day Israel launched a terrorizing siege of Gaza, cutting off fuel,
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:05.920]  food, medical supplies and other necessities in attempt to subdue the Palestinians while at the
[1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:10.560]  same time engaging in armed incursion. And response Hamas and others in Gaza, again,
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:14.560]  resorted to firing crude homemade and mainly inaccurate rockets into Israel. During the past
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:18.960]  seven years, these rockets have been responsible for the deaths of 17 Israelis over the same
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:23.440]  time span Israel blitzkrieg results in killing thousands of Palestinians, drawing worldwide
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:30.880]  protest, but failing and falling on deaf ears at the UN. And that's a Shama's cookie, the massacre
[1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:35.120]  in Palestine, the threat of a wider war global research, December 2008. Now, here's where the
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:42.720]  story gets into the key area. Planned humanitarian disaster on December 8th, U.S. Deputy Secretary
[1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:46.880]  of State John Negroponte was in Tel Aviv for discussions with the Israeli counterparts,
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:56.240]  including the director of Mossad Dagan. Operation Cast Lead was initiated two days after Christmas.
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:01.200]  It was coupled with a carefully designed international public relations campaign of the
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:09.520]  auspices of Israeli's foreign ministry, saying that Hamas had broken the ceasefire when they
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:13.680]  hadn't. It was Israel bombing all over the nation and also cutting off all the border
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:18.880]  entrances and not allowing any food or medicine in. Hamas military targets are not the main
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:24.400]  objective. Operation Cast Lead is intended quite deliberately to trigger civilian casualties.
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.960]  What we are dealing with is a planned humanitarian disaster. That's a quote in Gaza in a densely
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:36.240]  populated urban area. See the map on your screen. The longer term objective of the plan,
[1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:40.400]  as formulated by Israeli policymakers, is the expulsion of Palestinians from Palestinian
[1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:44.880]  lands. Terrorize the civilian population. This is a quote from Israeli war planning.
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:50.880]  Terrorize the civilian population, assuring maximum destruction of property and cultural
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:55.280]  resources. The daily life of the Palestinians must be rendered unbearable. They should be locked
[1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:59.760]  up in the cities and towns, prevented from exercising normal economic life, cut off from
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:04.720]  the workplaces, schools, and hospitals. This will encourage immigration and weaken the resistance
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:13.680]  to future expulsions. Er Sholensky quoted by Gillian Hussein, Gaza, the world's largest prison
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:19.200]  global research. And then they go into all the Israeli war planning where this is admitted.
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:24.320]  Operation Justified Vengeance. A turning point has been reached. Operation Cast Lead is part
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:29.200]  of a broader military intelligence operation initiated at the onset of Ariel Sharon's government
[1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:34.080]  in 2001. It was under Sharon's Operation Justified Vengeance that F-16 fighter planes were initially
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:38.800]  used to bomb Palestinian cities. Operation Justified Vengeance was presented in July 2001
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:46.720]  to the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon by the IDF staff, Saul Mofaz, under the title
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:51.440]  The Destruction of the Palestinian Authority and the Desirement of All Armed Forces. A contingency
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:57.760]  plan, codenamed Operation Justified Vengeance, was drawn up last June 2001 to reoccupy all
[1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:03.040]  the West Bank and possibly the Gaza Strip as a likely cost of hundreds of Israeli casualties.
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:09.600]  Washington Times 19th, March 2002. According to Jane's Foreign Report, Jane's Weapons Quarterly,
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:14.640]  July 2001, the Israeli army under Sharon had updated its plans for an all-out assault,
[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:18.800]  smashed the Palestinian Authority, forced out leader Yasser Arafat and killed or detained its army.
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:26.480]  Bloodshed Justification. The bloodshed justification was an essential component
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:30.480]  of the military intelligence agenda. The killing of Palestinian civilians was justified on
[1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:35.600]  humanitarian grounds. Israeli military operations were carefully timed to coincide with the suicide
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:40.320]  attacks. Again, remember, Israel founded Hamas as a counterbalance against the PLO.
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:44.480]  The assault would be launched at the government's discretion after a big suicide bomb attack in
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:49.200]  Israel causing widespread deaths and injuries, citing the bloodshed justification. That's Tanya
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:54.720]  Reinhardt, evil unleashed Israel move to deploy and destroy the Palestinian Authority in a
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:43:01.120]  calculated plan, also global research. The Dagan Plan, Operation Justified Vengeance, was also
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:08.960]  referred to as the Dagan Plan, named after General, now retired, Meyer Dagan, who currently had the
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:14.640]  Assad Israeli intelligence agency. Reserve General, Myron Dagan, was Sharon's National
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:18.560]  Security Advisor during the 2000 election campaign. The plan was apparently drawn up
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:23.040]  prior to Sharon's election as Prime Minister in February 2001, according to Alex Fishman,
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:28.880]  writing for Udoit, the Dagan Plan consisted in destroying the Palestinian Authority and putting
[1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:33.600]  Assad airfied out of the game. Operation Justified Vengeance, a secret plan to destroy the Palestinian
[1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:42.800]  Authority. As reported in Foreign Report, Jane, as disclosed locally by Israel's Invasion Plan
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:47.440]  in local papers, reportedly dubbed Justified Vengeance, would be launched immediately following
[1:43:47.440 --> 1:43:52.560]  the next high-casualty suicide bombing, would last them about a month, as expected a result in
[1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:59.280]  the death of hundreds of Israelis and thousands of Palestinians. The Dagan Plan envisioned the so-called
[1:44:02.160 --> 1:44:06.320]  Cantonization of the Palestinian Territories, whereby as the West Bank and Gaza would be
[1:44:06.320 --> 1:44:10.320]  totally cut off from one another with separate governments in each of the territories under
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:15.840]  the scenario already envisioned in 2001, Israel would negotiate separately with Palestinian
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:19.840]  forces that are dominant in each territory. Palestinian forces responsible for security,
[1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:27.120]  intelligence, and even from the FATA. This plan was closely resembled the idea of the
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:31.280]  Cantonization of Palestinian Territories put forth by a number of ministers.
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:38.320]  That's from LeMau, the big French publication, December 17, 2001. The Dagan Plan was established
[1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:43.200]  continuity in the military intelligence agenda. In the wake of the 2000 elections,
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:48.080]  Mayor Dagan was assigned a key role. He became Sharon's go-between to the security issues of
[1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:52.800]  the President Bush's special envoys, Zinni and Mitchell. He was subsequently appointed
[1:44:52.800 --> 1:44:57.440]  director of the Mossad by Prime Minister Ariel Serone 2002. In the post Serone period, he remained
[1:44:57.440 --> 1:45:01.840]  head of Mossad. He was reconfirmed in his position as director of Israeli intelligence
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:09.360]  by Prime Minister Ahud Olmert in June of 2008. Mayor Dagan, in coordination with the U.S.
[1:45:09.360 --> 1:45:13.760]  counterparts, has been in charge of various military intelligence operations. It is worth noting
[1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:18.160]  that Mayor Dagan as a young colonel had worked closely with the Defense Minister Ariel Serone
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:23.360]  and the raids on Palestinian settlements in Beirut in 2002. In 2009, ground offensive in Gaza
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:28.800]  in the many regards bear an uncanny resemblance to the 1982 military operation led by Serone and
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:35.520]  Dagan. Continuity from Serone to Olmert. Then it goes through how its whole continuity.
[1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:42.240]  And the basic plan, one, the assassination in November of Yasser Arafat. This assassination
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:46.000]  had been on the drawing board since 1996 under Operation Fields of Thorns. According to the
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:49.680]  October 2000 document prepared by the security service at the request of the Prime Minister
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:54.560]  Ahud Barak, stated that Arafat, the person to serve, the threat to the Prime Minister,
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:01.600]  the security state of Israel, and the damage which will result from his disappearance is
[1:46:01.600 --> 1:46:13.680]  less than the damage caused by his existence. And it continues here. Part two, removal under
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:18.320]  the orders of Prime Minister Ariel Serone 2005 of all Jewish settlements in Gaza. A Jewish population
[1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:27.200]  over 7,000 was relocated. This is from CBC March 2004. It is my intention Serone to carry out a
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:34.400]  evacuation, sorry, or relocation of settlements that cause us problems and of places that we
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:39.360]  will not hold on to anyway in a final settlement, like the Gaza settlements. I am working on the
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:43.520]  assumption that in the future there will be no Jews in Gaza Serone told CBC.
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:49.840]  The issue of the settlements in Gaza was presented as part of Washington's Roadmap to Peace
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:53.680]  celebrated by the Palestinians as a victory. This measure was not directed against the
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:57.760]  Jewish settlers. Quite the opposite. It was part of an overall covert operation which consisted
[1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:02.240]  in transforming Gaza into a concentration camp. As long as Jewish settlers were living inside
[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:07.920]  Gaza, the objective of sustaining a large barricade prison territory could not be achieved.
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:16.080]  The implementation of Operation Cast Lead required no Jews in Gaza. That's from CBC.
[1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:21.360]  Number three, the building of the infamous apartheid wall was decided upon at the beginning
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:28.000]  of the Serone government. Four, the next phase of the Hamas election victory in January 2006
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:34.400]  without Arafat, the Israeli military intelligence architects knew that FATA under Mahmoud Abbas
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:38.640]  would lose the elections. This was part of a scenario which had been envisioned and analyzed
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:43.200]  well in advance. With Hamas in charge of the Palestinian Authority, this is key, using the
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:49.360]  pretext that Hamas is a terrorist organization, Israel would carry out the process of kentenization
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:54.640]  as formulated under the Dagan plan. FATA under Mahmoud Abbas would remain formally in charge
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:58.880]  of the West Bank. The duly elected Hamas government would be confined to the Gaza Strip.
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:05.120]  Ground attack. On January 3rd, the Israeli tanks and infantry entered Gaza in an all-out ground
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:10.400]  offensive. The ground operation was preceded by several hours of heavy artillery fire after dark
[1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:15.520]  and nighting targets and flames and burst into the night sky. Machine gun fire rattled.
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:21.440]  Right tracer rounds flashed in the darkness and the clash of hundreds of shells set up streaks
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:27.440]  of fire, AP. Israeli sources have pointed to a lengthy drawn-out military operation. It won't
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:32.000]  be easy and it won't be short to Defense Minister Ehud Barak and the TV address. Israel is not seeking
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:36.560]  to oblige Hamas to cooperate. What we are dealing with is the implementation of the Dagan plan,
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:41.040]  a plan formulated in 2001 which called for an invasion of Palestinian controlled territory by
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:46.080]  some 30,000 Israeli soldiers with a clearly defined mission of destroying the infrastructure of the
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:50.400]  Palestinian leadership and collecting weaponry currently possessed by the various Palestinian
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:55.600]  forces and expelling or killing its military leadership. The broader question is whether
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:01.360]  Israel, in consolidation with Washington, is intent upon triggering a wider war. Mass expulsion
[1:49:01.360 --> 1:49:05.600]  could occur and some later stage of the ground invasion with the Israelis to open up the Gaza
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:12.400]  borders to allow the exodus of population. Expulsion was referred to by Ariel Sharon as the 1948
[1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:20.560]  style solution. Stay with us. With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues

[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:32.240]  coming up in the first 30 minutes of the next hour. Then Dr. Blalock will be joining us.
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:37.760]  We're going to try something new tomorrow at prisonplanet.tv. We're going to go live at
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:44.000]  noon central with our regular guest, Mike Rivera, and he's going to be live on a video cam feed
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:50.160]  with us on the show. We're going to have a lot of our guests who do have video cams
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:54.720]  with us here on the show in the future, adding more and more. We're going to add a document
[1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:58.720]  cam in here. I'm also going to add a little tablet where I can write on documents and things on
[1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:04.400]  screen, kind of like Joe Madden with football, but I can put up the Gaza strip map and go over
[1:53:05.200 --> 1:53:09.360]  things of that nature. That's all coming up here as we integrate the radio show with the
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:14.880]  prisonplanet.tv audience as we develop the show for putting it on a cable. We're satellite working
[1:53:14.880 --> 1:53:23.040]  on both right now and building another full TV studio out here. But continuing here at the end
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:28.000]  of this excellent article that's all meticulously sourced, the most of it right out of the Israeli
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:34.800]  and U.S. newspapers, it ends with the mass expulsion could occur at some later state
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:39.040]  of the ground invasion where the Israelis to open up Gaza borders to allow for an
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:44.400]  exodus of the population. Expulsion was referred to by Ariel Sharon as the 1948 style solution.
[1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:49.440]  For Sharon, it is only necessary to find another state for the Palestinians. Jordan is Palestine
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:58.160]  was the phrase that Sharon coined. So put that map back up there if you can of the Gaza strip for
[1:53:58.160 --> 1:54:06.480]  folks again there in bordering southern Israel to the east Egypt to the south in the Mediterranean
[1:54:06.480 --> 1:54:20.080]  sea to its west. It's the other map. They are completely surrounded. They are completely
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:30.560]  surrounded and they are under total siege. And if you look on the map you see Gaza city the largest
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:40.720]  with around 800,000 of the population than the other 700,000 are in some of the central cities
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:46.480]  and the southern cities. And what the Israeli military has done is they've encircled Gaza city.
[1:54:46.480 --> 1:55:01.120]  They've got gun boats and naval forces all along its border with the Mediterranean. Again down here
[1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:08.880]  to the south you have Egypt that the Gaza strip formerly belonged to and simply put
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:14.480]  the Ottoman Empire for hundreds of years controlled much of the Middle East and of
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:19.440]  course Israel. And then when they fell after World War I the British came in and filled the
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:25.120]  vacuum and the Rothschilds owned and controlled since their scam they ran in 1815 buying up the
[1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:30.480]  stock market claiming that Napoleon had won the battle of Waterloo. They were able to finance
[1:55:30.480 --> 1:55:35.840]  folks in Israel actually attacking British forces and after the British were kicked out what is
[1:55:35.840 --> 1:55:44.000]  the 1948 option? Israel declares sovereignty in 47 and then begins bombing, shooting, killing
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:50.240]  Arabs that were living there, Palestinians and pushing them out. That's the expulsion model.
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:55.360]  So you have Israel and that's why you had the Arabs who'd been there for thousands of years
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:56:00.240]  and back in the time when it was Judea who lived in peace with the Jews. In fact to be the Arabs
[1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:05.840]  and the Jews generally fighting with the Romans and the Babylonians and others. And it hadn't
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:10.960]  been Israel since 70 AD when Titus went in and did what Israel is doing to the Palestinians.
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:14.080]  Put the map back up right here. I want to show people something. Zoom in on this. I want to
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:19.840]  point it out here on my screen. Let's cut to camera 2 and I want to show people here on the
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:27.920]  screen myself. Notice that with the pincer attack the Israeli troops came in and circled Gaza City
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:33.520]  and then circled the other towns and have surrounded it. What did Titus do? Well Titus over
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:43.040]  in Jerusalem did the same thing 1938 years ago. He went in he encircled Jerusalem wait until they
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:48.000]  basically started death and went in and burned the place down. So this is just total siege ladies
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:54.480]  and gentlemen and Israel is doing what was done to them by the Romans 1900 plus years ago to the
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:57:03.760]  Gazans. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:12.640]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history a terrorist act of war against
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:18.560]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th but who is the enemy? Bin Laden.
[1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:22.880]  This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:27.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to
[1:57:27.120 --> 1:57:32.000]  intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:38.800]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:44.480]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:48.720]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:54.400]  the shadow government and much much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com.

[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:20.960]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:28.240]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:37.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:38.160 --> 1:58:42.320]  All right, I want to get into the economy, all the new taxes they're setting up,
[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:45.680]  how they've got this supposed right-wing gatekeeper or Judas Goat,
[1:58:46.480 --> 1:58:52.880]  the local viceroy over Christian conservatives here in the United States. Pat Robertson,
[1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:58.960]  if you thought him saying China was good to have forced abortion, that he loved their
[1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:03.040]  Planned Parenthood program that needed to be more aggressive, then you're going to love the
[1:59:03.040 --> 1:59:08.960]  new stuff he's saying. He is almost trumping Pastor Hagee saying Jesus isn't the Messiah.
[1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:12.400]  Whether you're Christian or not, that's pretty asinine to have a supposed Christian leader
[1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:18.240]  saying that. He is now out saying that socialism will basically save the United States and that
[1:59:18.240 --> 1:59:23.840]  Obama cannot be stopped and that Obama is a great guy and that socialism will ease our pain.
[1:59:23.840 --> 1:59:27.760]  So just an amazing thing that's happening there that is coming up.
[1:59:28.400 --> 1:59:33.600]  Finishing up the horrible carnage in Gaza. This is tribal warfare and both sides have
[1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:39.840]  done terrible things to each other. There's no doubting that. And Israel can say they have a
[1:59:39.840 --> 1:59:46.880]  claim on that from their point of view, but the Arabs have an even stronger claim. And my whole
[1:59:46.880 --> 1:59:54.480]  issue here is Mexico did control Texas, parts of Louisiana, and then all the way to California.
[1:59:54.480 --> 1:59:59.920]  Before that, it was a Spanish Empire. Now, it's taught in Mexico that the Southwest belongs to
[1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:04.560]  Mexico and will be reconquered. And the billboards are put up in Spanish speaking TV and radio says
[2:00:04.560 --> 2:00:09.840]  that constantly and it's pushed. Do we want to get into a situation with the United Nations
[2:00:09.840 --> 2:00:16.080]  where the group that previously had control of this area is now saying it's theirs?
[2:00:17.440 --> 2:00:20.480]  And usually when I hear that analogy, it's an example of the Palestinians
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:28.720]  previously having control and then now Israel taking it over in the 1940s. But really, if you
[2:00:28.720 --> 2:00:34.640]  go back, we have people from all over Europe immigrating there, some of them Jews, some of
[2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:44.000]  them not saying that because they were there 1938 years ago that it belongs to Israel. I mean,
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:48.080]  the Arabs were always there. They're there now. They have their mosque, their religious centers
[2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:54.800]  there. You know, there wouldn't be such a big deal if this was, say, part of southern Syria or part of
[2:00:56.640 --> 2:01:00.480]  Jordan. I mean, it would be bad enough if Israel went and took that, but that's just some desert
[2:01:00.480 --> 2:01:04.800]  or some mountains. This is the Holy Land. This is where the Crusades happen. This is where the
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:09.040]  Muslims and the Christians fought before that. The Jews and the Romans fought. I mean, this is
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:13.360]  an area that people have always been fighting over. What I don't like is the United States being
[2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:19.040]  sucked into the middle of it and the United States funding on average $30,000. That's an
[2:01:19.040 --> 2:01:23.680]  accurate number of color mentioned earlier per citizen of Israel. I mean, I'm against foreign aid
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:30.720]  to anybody. And as Ron Paul has said, and then the larger issue here domestically is that the
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:37.200]  media is lying and saying that Hamas broke the ceasefire when the ceasefire deal was is that the
[2:01:37.200 --> 2:01:41.200]  border entrances would be open to Israel at the checkpoints. You go through a checkpoint. Those
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:44.720]  are just completely shut down for people to get jobs in Israel and a lot of people in Israel want
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:51.040]  to hire them. And that Israel wouldn't engage any more bombings in the West Bank. And they broke
[2:01:51.040 --> 2:01:54.480]  that. They intended to break that the whole time while they were building up, getting ready for
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:58.880]  this invasion. Now they've encircled the three major cities in the small towns and they're just
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:02.240]  going to wait it out, let them starve to death basically. And they've bombed their infrastructure,
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:06.880]  their small water treatment facilities, their wells. They have bombed their electrical systems.
[2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:12.000]  They've bombed their communications installations. And you've got a million and a half people there,
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:16.960]  ladies and gentlemen. And the tunnels bringing in food and supplies and fuel oil and Israel says
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:24.400]  weapons, no doubt that's happening. Those have all been bombed. And three million Iraqis have
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:28.560]  died in the 18 years of occupation. Well, the siege and then the five and a half years of
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:32.400]  occupation. A million and a half of those in the last five and a half years. I mean, this is horrible
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:37.520]  what's being done in our name. And Israel wanted in the 80s to have the U.S. invade Iraq and break
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:41.920]  it in three parts, three regional areas. And that's already happened. So this is part of a larger
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:47.760]  strategic plan. And it's classical tyranny. It's classical colonialism. The Ottomans got kicked
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  out after World War One. The Nazis, the British fought over North Africa in the Middle East.
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:56.720]  The British got control over it after World War Two. And Israel came in and kicked the British out
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:03.200]  and set up Israel. And now we're in the middle of it today. That's what happened here. And it is just
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:08.880]  a real shame that so many people are dying. Thousands and thousands of injured Palestinians
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:12.880]  and well over 700 dead. We'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:20.880]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:25.120]  self sufficient. And today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent. And food
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:29.600]  and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread. You'll
[2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:34.320]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:38.800]  if you simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:43.200]  interest. So they ignored your screams not to do it. They turned off the telephones and email.
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:48.800]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air. This money now owns the American
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:53.760]  and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[2:03:53.760 --> 2:03:59.040]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans reach.
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:04.080]  In pre Nazi Germany, super inflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until
[2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:09.280]  it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:14.320]  may be no end in sight. The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:18.560]  stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less food but jack of prices
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:23.360]  to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready. Everything
[2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:27.760]  is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:33.120]  other necessities. My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self sufficient, get food. For
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:36.800]  everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of
[2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:41.040]  storeable food, the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:45.360]  mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one is going to take care of
[2:04:45.360 --> 2:04:49.920]  your family in the final equation but you. You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[2:04:49.920 --> 2:04:55.040]  storeable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do

[2:05:23.680 --> 2:05:31.040]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[2:05:34.800 --> 2:05:39.360]  We have a news report the Curt Nemo wrote up on the featured stories section
[2:05:39.920 --> 2:05:47.200]  ovenfullwars.com if you'd like to read along. It has links to TV programs Pat Robertson has done
[2:05:47.200 --> 2:05:56.640]  to his own CBN show where he says he likes Obama, he thinks he's a good guy, he supports him.
[2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:02.320]  So that shows you the power structure even when, quote, Christian conservatives main leader
[2:06:03.120 --> 2:06:09.520]  comes out and starts saying, hey, I like Obama. Now on the heels of that every year,
[2:06:09.520 --> 2:06:11.840]  the day after the new year, the first day of the year,
[2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:19.920]  he claims that he gets messages from God. And that was that we were going to have a rebellion
[2:06:19.920 --> 2:06:28.720]  in riots in the streets and nukes going off in 2008 that didn't happen. Most of his predictions
[2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:34.400]  end up being wrong. It's really propaganda. But if you analyze what he said this year
[2:06:34.400 --> 2:06:40.720]  and we're analyzing it here today, part of it, it's lengthy.
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:49.280]  Pat Robertson comes out and he says the economy is going to get better in 2009.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:54.080]  And he says it's basically going to happen because Obama is going to bring in socialism
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:07:00.080]  and Americans are going to embrace it and that is going to lessen their pain.
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:09.120]  So he's doing this in lawyer speak, kind of like he said it in lawyer speak, what back in 2001,
[2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:13.760]  when he said, well, China's got really aggressive Planned Parenthood and even some forced abortions.
[2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:17.600]  He said it on CNN, Larry King Live. But he said, you know, China's doing what it has to do and they
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:22.480]  need more aggressive family planning. Now I even have the Huffington Post this weekend came out
[2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:27.680]  about the UN supporting sterilization and forced abortions and even the liberal Huffington Post
[2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:32.960]  is saying this is wrong. But then Pat Robertson saying it's good because he supports whatever
[2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:39.440]  the neural order is pushing. So now we have the Huffington Post decrying UN population eugenics,
[2:07:39.440 --> 2:07:45.280]  but we have Robertson saying it's good and we have Robertson saying, you know, posing it and
[2:07:45.280 --> 2:07:51.520]  phrasing it here that this is what will save you. This will fix things. And then he adds,
[2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:59.200]  nothing can stop this. God told him nothing can stand before Obama. This economic restructuring,
[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:05.360]  then he goes to the talking point of this will be like the new deal. But this isn't just the
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:11.680]  new deal. People building bridges and roads and rest stops and power plants and dams,
[2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:15.680]  which is bad enough. I got people under federal control. This is going to be youth cores and
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:20.880]  spy cores and a domestic force of a million people now being announced again by Rahm Emanuel
[2:08:20.880 --> 2:08:26.960]  and the new incoming White House. So it's going to be even worse. And the fed are talking about
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:30.960]  taking over failing newspapers and having to be federal. And they're talking about just all of
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:36.640]  this and a $700 billion payoff to corporations, select corporations to go along with all this.
[2:08:36.640 --> 2:08:44.080]  So he's laying all this out like it's a good idea that it's going to ease your pain and things are
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:49.840]  going to get better under this and you can't stop it. That's what he says in this. You can go read
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:55.200]  the transcript carefully at info wars.com and read his other quotes from separate TV appearances
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:09:00.960]  where he says he likes Obama and Obama's good and he wants to work with him. He's also running
[2:09:00.960 --> 2:09:06.000]  TV ads with Al Sharpton saying global warming is real. Climate change is real. We need these global
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:10.480]  taxes, which is the economic takeover of the bankers. So let's go ahead and go to this clip
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:16.640]  here on screen. Pat Robertson last week, first day of the new year, laying out his predictions.
[2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:24.320]  So here are some of the things that I feel are going to be happening in 2009.
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:33.680]  The Lord said the economy of your nation will recover. The steps taken will lead to a dramatic
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:41.680]  increase in the power of government. The people will welcome socialism in order to relieve their
[2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:51.120]  pain. Nothing will stand in the way of a plan by Obama to restructure the economy in the same
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:56.720]  fashion as the New Deal in the 30s. America will never again have the power in the world that it
[2:09:56.720 --> 2:10:02.880]  has enjoyed since World War II. With no strong leadership, dangerous dictators will arise in
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:06.960]  various parts of the world that will threaten the peace and security of millions of people.
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:13.360]  Russia will be the most dangerous and will lead the coalition to control the Middle East.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:20.000]  Israel is entering a period of extreme crisis. A strong government that deals forcefully with
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.800]  the Palestinians will bring international condemnation and sanctions against Israel.
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:32.240]  But the Lord will uphold his people despite world opinion. The whole of Islam is weakening.
[2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:38.480]  The violence in bloodshed has turned many against this religion of hate. And the Lord said,
[2:10:38.480 --> 2:10:44.880]  Expand your outreach to Muslims, they are ready to listen. Great and cataclysmic things will
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:52.320]  become commonplace around the world. Poverty and misery will be widespread. There has never been,
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:58.960]  nor will there ever be, a more propitious time for the gospel. People by the tens of millions
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:04.240]  will be seeking answers. They will gladly receive the forgiveness of sins that was.
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:11.200]  Yeah, but what gospel is it? I mean, Pat, you always talk about some Muslim nations. There's
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:15.520]  only a few of them where they don't allow Christianity to be taught. Saudi Arabia are an ally.
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:22.560]  But then they attack all the Muslim nations where Christianity is flourishes. But then in Israel,
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:26.400]  Christianity is illegal to teach. I mean, why won't you ever talk? And I'm not even here attacking
[2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:30.640]  Israel. I'm just stating the facts. And then he goes through the power of government will grow,
[2:11:30.640 --> 2:11:36.720]  but it will fix the economy. Nothing will stand in its way. Russia is the big, great evil. And
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:42.400]  obviously any big nation is under wicked control. That's the nature of government. But it wasn't
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:48.240]  Russia that snuck attack Georgia. It was US globalist backed Georgia that attacked them on 888
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:54.880]  last year. So they are really insulting everybody's intelligence here. They talk about, you know,
[2:11:54.880 --> 2:12:00.720]  Israel being internationally condemned. And this clearly is Obama's unpopular stance in the new
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:04.960]  year, because he will have to comment on what's happening. And notice how the attacks were launched
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:09.200]  when Bush is outgoing, when it's during the holidays, the attacks were launched Christmas Eve,
[2:12:09.200 --> 2:12:14.240]  when people are diverted and distracted. Notice how this is all happening in the in-between time,
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:20.400]  and then Obama won't comment on it. And then there's a story about what's happening in the
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:29.520]  London Guardian over in Gaza today. And the story is titled Obama is losing a battle. He doesn't
[2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:35.040]  know he's in. Oh yeah, he doesn't know this is all unpopular. The president elects silence on
[2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:39.360]  Gaza crisis is undermining his reputation in the Middle East. And it goes on to say in Europe.
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:44.960]  Well, of course, he knows this. This is one of the unpopular things. And we have India and
[2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:48.960]  Pakistan massing troops threatening to attack each other. We had those staged events three or
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:56.240]  four weeks ago in Mumbai, formerly Bombay. We have all of this going on. Also, they're announcing a
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:01.840]  gas tax hike they want. They're announcing moves for new federal taxes. They're announcing windfall
[2:13:01.840 --> 2:13:07.280]  profits on retirement investments. So that means taxing pension funds and 401ks, what the congressional
[2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:11.200]  committees have been recommending the last month. That's also so part of the unpopularity.
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.880]  They've had Rahm Emanuel and others running around on TV again saying, yes, it's going to be compulsory
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:22.560]  service 18 to 24 in a new domestic military, but that you want to go overseas. And then it's not
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:27.040]  a draft, but you have to do it, which is more double speak. It's not a draft, but you're going
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:33.600]  to boot camp. I don't want to play that clip that we played last night on radio only. I want to dig
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:42.880]  that up later in the hour and get to that. Okay. Oh, I had a caller from Chile that hung up Robin
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:49.040]  Chile. Call back and I'll definitely get to you before our next guest comes on 800-25-99-231.
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:52.480]  I'm trying to get to your calls, but there's just so much news that has to be covered. I'm trying
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:56.720]  to be more disciplined here on the show, but Rob call us back. I want to go to Mike and Sherry and
[2:13:56.720 --> 2:14:03.520]  Jen and Stuart and Rob and everybody else, but I really want to hear from folks outside of the
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:06.320]  United States and other parts of the world. That's always so interesting to get their take
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:09.280]  on what's happening. Okay. Briefly, and the time we've got left in this segment,
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:19.360]  most, this is a totally separate area. Most of the UFO reports that we see being hyped by
[2:14:21.360 --> 2:14:28.480]  NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, Larry King Live, like UFOs are landing. They're real. Aliens are real.
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:34.640]  Why is the mainstream media behaving like all this is real? We know there's a declassified
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:38.400]  government plan, Project Bluebeam that's on the books. We don't know they'll ever do it.
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:44.240]  To claim aliens have invaded to unify a world government. They have other programs with big
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:50.160]  holograms they can project that are declassified to show Buddha, Allah, Jesus, or anything else they
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:56.480]  want. We're talking 2000, 3000 foot tall holograms that they can project to freak people out.
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:03.280]  And I ask, why is the mainstream media now hyping UFOs and aliens and saying it's real?
[2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:07.760]  Now there are scores of these press reports and in most of them, they don't even say it's
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:14.480]  probably a blimp. These giant, you know, two, three football field long cigar shaped things.
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:21.680]  They don't even say that it's a blimp or that it could be a blimp. They just say UFO. What is it?
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:28.240]  Well, I meant to pull this up for the show. One of you Google this because I forgot to do it. Google
[2:15:28.240 --> 2:15:39.920]  Homeland Security blimps or Homeland Security to use blimps to protect U.S., something like that.
[2:15:39.920 --> 2:15:49.040]  It's actually in my film Marshall Law. They announced giant high altitude between 80,000 and 100
[2:15:49.040 --> 2:15:55.840]  plus thousand feet, robot blimps that are computer controlled with solar panels on them that charge
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:15:59.440]  batteries with these big propellers and up there, there's not a lot of winds. It's very easy for
[2:15:59.440 --> 2:16:02.640]  them to stay very still and that they're going to have ground penetrating radar looking through
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:08.320]  your houses, incredible optics, even better than satellites watching and surveilling the American
[2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:16.080]  people under Homeland Security. And then now these blimps are arriving. I remember seeing in,
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:24.480]  there's a CNN article where you can see DC with the monument and the big surveillance blimp for
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:30.400]  Homeland Security. It's the same blimp. Now suddenly the news says, no, it's not blimps.
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:36.160]  It's not Homeland Security. We don't know what it is. And the FAA comes out and says, hey,
[2:16:41.120 --> 2:16:46.480]  this isn't the government. We don't pick it up on radar. We're going out of break here, but
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:52.480]  just so people watching on prisonplanet.tv or in the break have a chance to see what we're
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:58.080]  seeing without audio. Start playing that particular ABC newscast and then some of the amateur video
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:02.400]  and you can see it. These are the propellers. You can see the blisters of surveillance equipment.
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:08.960]  It's a silver blimp. But they go, no, that's not a Homeland Security blimp. That's a UFO.
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:16.720]  And then the public goes, okay, it's aliens then. So we're analyzing this propaganda right now.
[2:17:16.720 --> 2:17:24.080]  So stay with us. You look at the blimp. We'll come back and talk about it when we get back.
[2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:31.280]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world
[2:17:31.280 --> 2:17:36.000]  suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection? You may be one of millions of people
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:40.800]  suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:46.480]  doctor would never know it. In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all
[2:17:46.480 --> 2:17:51.680]  cases. Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis. Now you can fight internal parasites,
[2:17:51.680 --> 2:17:57.520]  heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton
[2:17:57.520 --> 2:18:03.280]  powder also known as FPP with your favorite beverage once a day. FPP is used around the world,
[2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:09.200]  has numerous uses and is now available to you from freshwater organics. FPP strengthens skin,
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:14.080]  hair and bones, lowers cholesterol and is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:19.760]  with 14 trace minerals. Order some today at freshwaterorganics.com. Again, that's freshwater

[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:34.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:39.520]  But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:45.040]  to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[2:18:45.040 --> 2:18:50.240]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:57.120]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:02.800]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[2:19:02.800 --> 2:19:07.040]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:12.720]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com,
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:42.400]  or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:50.400]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority
[2:19:50.400 --> 2:19:54.800]  to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:19:59.040]  interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business. The November
[2:19:59.040 --> 2:20:04.000]  assassination quieted the production of the new currency. However, the executive order still stands
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:11.760]  unrepealed. Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document. Call 800-686-2237. Unlike your liberty,

[2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:36.960]  All right. If you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, we've been showing the news saying,
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:41.600]  is this a flying saucer? The government won't tell us. And so because the government won't
[2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:48.640]  tell them it's a blimp, they go, okay, it must be aliens. But I pulled up, punch up that MSNBC,
[2:21:48.640 --> 2:21:54.560]  the very article I saw five years ago, from memory. We pulled it up. We googled Homeland
[2:21:54.560 --> 2:21:58.720]  Security Blimps. It's Washington, D.C. with a blimp above it, admitting that they're going
[2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:04.880]  to surveil the public with the blimp. I mean, it's just absolutely amazing. There it is.
[2:22:04.880 --> 2:22:08.720]  Eyes in the sky for Homeland Security. From blimps to do-it-yourself unmanned vehicles,
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:12.800]  a trend takes flight. And they say they're going to tether these blimps all over the United States.
[2:22:13.840 --> 2:22:18.240]  Some will be tethered. Others will be super high altitude drones. And that's the ones you're-the
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:23.120]  larger ones you're seeing. And then the public looks at it. You can see the fins, the surveillance
[2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:29.120]  blisters of equipment. This is what's watching us, controlling us. It is doing face scans.
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:32.880]  That's the Bob Woodward super technology he's talking about, where it even knows your shadow
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:38.880]  and how you walk biometrically. It's just incredible. Go ahead and play a little bit of
[2:22:38.880 --> 2:22:43.520]  that ABC News report where they're like, what is it? We don't know. Who knows what it is?
[2:22:43.520 --> 2:22:45.440]  And then we'll go to the caller from Chile. Here it is.
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:54.320]  What's hovering over Salt Lake City? Is it a rocket, a blimp, a UFO?
[2:22:55.040 --> 2:22:59.120]  A strange object seen in the skies has residents scratching their heads.
[2:22:59.120 --> 2:23:03.760]  It's a blimp! A draft floated overhead for several minutes before disappearing.
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:08.640]  Salt Lake Air Traffic Controllers said their radar didn't pick up anything, and they have no knowledge.
[2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:15.920]  All right, that's enough. That's enough. I mean, it's clearly a blimp. But because the
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:20.080]  government won't tell us, because the government lied to us and said that they don't see it,
[2:23:20.080 --> 2:23:23.600]  then we don't see it. It must be aliens, because the government wouldn't lie.
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:29.760]  I mean, and then this is all over the news. Every day, these things are seen all over Texas,
[2:23:29.760 --> 2:23:34.560]  all over the country, and it's, oh, it's the cigar-shaped craft. It's the aliens. I mean,
[2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:42.480]  it's unbelievable. It's a blimp. Bring it over here in the timeline where you can
[2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:47.760]  see even the back end of it. I mean, it is so clear, so clear that it's a blimp.
[2:23:47.760 --> 2:23:50.640]  And while we're looking at the blimp, let's go to Rob and Chile.
[2:23:50.640 --> 2:23:58.560]  Hey, Rob, thanks for tuning in from Chile. Go ahead, Rob. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Go ahead. What
[2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:05.520]  are you doing down in Chile? Well, my goal is to be a YouTube journalist to document
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:12.480]  what is happening down here, because Hugo Chavez is not a bad man, not at all. And I know that
[2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:19.760]  I heard you interview Dr. William Pepper, and he told you that he's a good man.
[2:24:19.760 --> 2:24:26.000]  Well, are you in Venezuela or are you in Chile? No, right now I'm in Chile, but my goal is to
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:32.400]  be in Venezuela. I came here for a girlfriend, unfortunately, but I wanted to let, I was in
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:39.280]  Denmark. I am an info warrior, and I was doing PowerPoint presentations, you know, with video
[2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:45.920]  and everything in Denmark, and then they closed my school, a school that started in 1869.
[2:24:45.920 --> 2:24:50.080]  They closed it. I mean, it's just an amazing thing.
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:56.640]  Well, I mean, Hugo Chavez is shutting down some media. He is grabbing, you know, some
[2:24:56.640 --> 2:24:59.760]  corporations, some gold mines now, and I do think he's a little bit out of control.
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:06.000]  I mean, I think compared to like Stalin, he's not bad. But I mean, to me, it's got, hold on,
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:11.120]  hold on. People always see this as good or bad. No, I mean, I see governments generally as being
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:14.800]  corrupt historically. You've got the corrupt New World Order that's the big monster. And you've
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:18.480]  got Chavez, who might have started out okay, but he's been doing some stuff I don't like,
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:20.960]  but I don't think he should be assassinated like Pat Robertson says.
[2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:29.840]  Yeah. Well, Pat Robertson is, please, that punch that Barack Obama is going to be the next president.
[2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:32.880]  Oh, yeah, because he's going to war monger and everything else and get left cover
[2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:36.800]  and steal lots of treasury money to give it to select bankers as corporate welfare.
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:46.240]  I want to tell you one story from I teach English and I was going to a place taking
[2:25:46.240 --> 2:25:52.560]  a what they call a collectivo, a little car that takes about four people. And I'm sitting there
[2:25:52.560 --> 2:25:59.360]  with this woman who is very obviously poor. And well, the mode of transportation is for
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:05.280]  poor people generally. And she asked me where I was from. I told her from the States, of course,
[2:26:05.280 --> 2:26:10.480]  all of this is in Spanish. And, you know, she's clearly very poor and she's missing teeth and
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:16.400]  everything. And I tell her that I'm not she asked me if I'm for Obama on the cane. And I say,
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:23.040]  Oh, I'm beyond all of that. You know, I left the States many years ago because of frustration.
[2:26:23.040 --> 2:26:27.920]  And what did she say? We're almost out of time. She said, Do you know Alex Jones?
[2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:35.360]  And it just blew me away. Just completely blew my mind. I said, Yes, I do. You know Alex Jones.
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:44.320]  And she even knew that Prescott Bush was born in Columbus, Ohio, which is where I was born.
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:49.120]  And I mean, that just blew my mind. So the word is getting out. I have no idea,
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:55.040]  because she didn't speak any English. So how she managed to do this, I don't know. But
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:58.160]  the word is spreading down here. All right, God bless you. Appreciate your call.
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:02.160]  Yeah, I don't really chewed our horn enough because it kind of freaks me out, folks. We're
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:07.040]  reaching millions of new people a week, conservatively. I mean, praise God, we're having a huge effect
[2:27:07.040 --> 2:27:10.640]  here. And it's getting a little bit scary because a lot of people are paying attention and I'm trying
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:17.840]  to up our game to be as accurate and as focused as possible. We're on the March, the Empire's on
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:25.360]  the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:30.240]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:34.640]  9-Eleven was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:39.040]  the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? Was it engineered
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:42.720]  by you, David Rockefeller, the pro-latter commission, the CFR?
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:48.080]  Please sit down and shout out. The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:54.000]  allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:28:01.280]  11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:07.840]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:28:07.840 --> 2:28:12.800]  Well, hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:16.160]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:22.240]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:24.800]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:28:25.840 --> 2:28:28.000]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:33.520]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:35.520]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:39.760]  We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money,
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:44.480]  not for your safety. But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:51.440]  When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself to be the most
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:55.200]  effective device available against traffic cameras. Invisible to the naked eye,
[2:28:55.200 --> 2:28:59.440]  your license plate when flashed will be overexposed and unreadable to the cameras.

[2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:28.640]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:32.880]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:38.320]  Utopia Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver,
[2:29:38.320 --> 2:29:41.120]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:44.560]  without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions.
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:48.080]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles,
[2:29:48.080 --> 2:29:52.160]  it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be
[2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:55.280]  resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[2:29:55.280 --> 2:29:59.440]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements, including colloidal silver,
[2:29:59.440 --> 2:30:03.520]  gold and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[2:30:03.520 --> 2:30:08.080]  For four years Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would
[2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:11.680]  steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.
[2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:20.640]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com or call 888-213-4338.
[2:30:20.640 --> 2:30:33.920]  We're here live Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:40.560]  Then it's retransmitted on AM and FM stations, global shortwave throughout the day and evening
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:46.320]  morning, and of course always pumping out the truth with over 120,000 people a day downloading
[2:30:46.320 --> 2:30:51.040]  the free podcast and growing about 5,000 a week at infowars.com.
[2:30:52.240 --> 2:30:56.880]  Then it's copied to YouTube, Google, videos all over the world, people put images to the radio show.
[2:30:57.840 --> 2:31:01.200]  We're trying to step it up, help everybody by putting our own images over the radio show
[2:31:01.200 --> 2:31:06.320]  for the visual folks. People are taking the videos and translating them into Spanish, German,
[2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:13.680]  into French, into Chinese, into Japanese. Very, very exciting. I want to thank all those out
[2:31:13.680 --> 2:31:17.680]  there. It's a team effort in the info war to see the big picture, the larger paradigm. We're going
[2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:23.200]  to go to just an amazing guest, Dr. Russell Blalock, for the balance of the show today and open the
[2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:27.200]  phones up coming up in the next hour. You can pretty much get into any issue. I know some of you
[2:31:27.200 --> 2:31:32.720]  have been holding a while, but mainly we're talking about Alzheimer's, all these brain diseases that
[2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:39.840]  35, 40-year-olds are getting now, what fluoride does, what the aspartame and other excitotoxins
[2:31:39.840 --> 2:31:45.920]  like MSG you're doing with our guest, we're going to in just one moment. Before I do that,
[2:31:45.920 --> 2:31:50.880]  I want to tell you who makes this radio show possible and all the sponsors you hear me endorse
[2:31:50.880 --> 2:31:54.640]  are the sponsors I believe in. The network has some of its own and they're all fine and dandy,
[2:31:54.640 --> 2:31:58.880]  but these are the ones I've researched. I believe in and I'm pushing and eatfoodsdirect.com,
[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:02.560]  the J. Michael Stevens group is the best price, the longest continually operating,
[2:32:02.560 --> 2:32:06.960]  storeable foods company in the nation. They ship quickly. It's non-GMO food. Everything but the
[2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:11.760]  bananas is grown right here in the United States and it's just the highest quality last more than
[2:32:11.760 --> 2:32:18.160]  10 years in climate control, 10 years in non-climate control like your garage or attic. This is where
[2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:21.360]  I've gotten my storeable foods. That's why I went out and approached them about being sponsors
[2:32:21.360 --> 2:32:25.120]  because I bought from other companies and I ended up testing it out and I like theirs the best.
[2:32:26.320 --> 2:32:31.440]  They're told free number to call and get a free brochure, a free audio CD or to learn more
[2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:38.960]  is 800-409-5633. 800-409-5633. If you forget the website or the phone number,
[2:32:39.600 --> 2:32:44.400]  which again is 800-409-5633, you can go to mfolwars.com and prisonplanet.com
[2:32:44.400 --> 2:32:49.360]  and there's big fat banners there and going into these uncertain times more than ever people need
[2:32:49.360 --> 2:32:53.840]  to be prepared and need to protect themselves and be self-sufficient with water filters,
[2:32:53.840 --> 2:32:58.720]  firearms, gold and silver and of course have good friends and family to work with. It looks
[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:02.000]  like it's going to be a global depression orchestrated by the private central banks
[2:33:02.000 --> 2:33:05.920]  to bring in their world government. So eFoodsDirect.com, we salute them
[2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:11.200]  and thank them for making this broadcast possible. Also another sponsor that goes well
[2:33:11.200 --> 2:33:17.040]  with preparedness is AkolaBlue.com. AkolaBlue is the best water generator and we looked at a
[2:33:17.040 --> 2:33:21.920]  whole bunch of them. Not just the best quality but the best price and then it goes through
[2:33:21.920 --> 2:33:27.440]  five filters and two sub filters, so a total of seven after it grabs the water out of the air.
[2:33:27.440 --> 2:33:31.440]  You can be in your house, your office, your back porch and the average weather, average
[2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:34.400]  humidity, it gets about seven and a half gallons even in the driest desert, it's more than three
[2:33:34.400 --> 2:33:40.320]  gallons. There's water everywhere in the air we breathe, in the air that's all around us,
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:45.920]  that's what clouds are. And AkolaBlue.com, E-C-O-L-O, Blue.com, Atmospheric Water Generator for
[2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:51.280]  your home, Great Tasting Pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it no chemicals, pollutants or

[2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:27.280]  us. That said, I really appreciate him joining us for the next hour and 20-something minutes.
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:32.080]  Dr. Russell Blalock is a board certified neurosurgeon, author and lecturer. He's into the LSU
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:37.040]  School of Medicine in New Orleans and completed his general surgical internship and neurosurgical
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:41.440]  residency at the Medical Center of South Carolina in Charleston. During his residency,
[2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:46.640]  he ran the neurology program for a year and did a fellowship in neurosurgery after his residency.
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:50.240]  For the past 25 years, he has practiced neurosurgery in addition to having
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:53.840]  nutritional practice. He recently retired from both practices to devote full time to
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:58.480]  nutritional studies and research. During his research training, he worked with the imminent
[2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:03.040]  neurosurgeon, Dr. Ludwig Kimpe, I believe I'm pronouncing that right. Together, they developed the
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:12.080]  trends of, I'm pronouncing this right, colosal removal of intravascular tumors,
[2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:16.960]  which is still used today. Dr. Blalock presented these cases, utilizing the technique to the
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:21.040]  Congress of Neurosurgical Surgeons. Folks, it goes on from page after page. He's one of the top
[2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:26.560]  now retired brain surgeons in the world and he's done a lot of studies and reads every day all the
[2:37:26.560 --> 2:37:31.840]  other major studies about what these toxins in our environment are doing and ways to not
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:38.320]  ingest all those. I have a lot of questions today. There's a video making the rounds on YouTube,
[2:37:39.280 --> 2:37:42.880]  a little three-minute rant I did where this caller calls in and can't talk,
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:45.520]  and he's saying I'm a liar about the U.S. bringing Nazis in, and I said,
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:50.240]  but it's all over the news. Folks have put articles about that up over me talking,
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:56.000]  and I make the point. I say, sir, depending on the studies, 15 to 30 percent brain size reduction,
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  not being breastfed, and he got real mad about that. But I mean, that's just one other little area.
[2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:05.520]  There's so much I want to talk to him about, and I'm very thankful for him joining us.
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:08.240]  Dr. Blalock, it's so good to have you here with us.
[2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:10.800]  Dr. Blalock Well, thank you. It's a pleasure being on your program.
[2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:12.800]  Dr. Blalock You bet. Thank you for sitting through my plugs.
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:17.040]  Out of the Gates, tell folks about your books, your videos, your materials,
[2:38:17.040 --> 2:38:20.480]  your websites here at the very start of the show for people that want to learn more.
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:33.360]  Dr. Blalock My website is www.russellblalockmd.com. That's R-U-S-S-E-L-L-V-L-A-Y-L-R-D-K-M-D.com.
[2:38:34.080 --> 2:38:42.160]  And it has a section of free information. I write papers about anything from mercury toxicity,
[2:38:42.160 --> 2:38:50.720]  vaccines, cholesterol nonsense, and I have a paper on regimentation in medicine and the death of
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:55.520]  creativity, which people would be interested in if they're interested in the effect of
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:06.800]  collectivism on medicine. And I have some DVDs on nutrition and behavior, which talks about
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:12.560]  the effects of nutrition on how people think as well as criminality, suicide risk,
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:18.320]  all of these things that we're hearing in the news today about our young people
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:25.440]  being uncontrollable and the direct connection to diet and what you could do about it is discussed
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:34.480]  on this DVD. I have a newsletter that's published through newsmax.com, the Blalock Well,
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:43.200]  report, which is a monthly report update all the things on nutrition, and I have several books,
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:49.120]  Excited Toxins The Taste That Kills was the original book, and it's about MSG and aspartame
[2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:55.120]  toxicity to the brain and nervous system. And then a general nutrition book was more recent,
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:40:00.800]  it's a health and nutrition secret that can save your life, which covers all sorts of subjects,
[2:40:00.800 --> 2:40:06.560]  vaccination, fluoride, mercury, toxicity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, a lot of
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:12.960]  different subjects, and it's very comprehensive. The third book is Natural Strategies for
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:20.080]  Cancer Patients, in which I reviewed a world of studies on nutrition and cancer suppression.
[2:40:20.960 --> 2:40:25.920]  It goes through how to not only use it primarily to treat cancers of various kinds,
[2:40:25.920 --> 2:40:31.760]  but also how it enhances the effectiveness of what's considered traditional cancer treatment
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:40.400]  and makes them less toxic. But these are two recent books, the last two. The Excited Toxins
[2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:47.680]  book was updated in 1997, I think it was. And it's all available at your website that we have up
[2:40:47.680 --> 2:40:53.040]  on screen for everybody watching at PrisonPlanet.tv. Just while you were talking there for a minute or
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:58.080]  two, Obama, the major changes, if they haven't taken over medicine already, now they're openly
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:03.520]  announcing it. I want to get into what SSRI is, just the toxicity alone is doing, admitting that
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:07.360]  it causes suicide. I want to get into the youth that you mentioned. I want to get into the numbers
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:12.640]  we see with cancer being way up, why allergies are way up and people that have never had them,
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:17.920]  your take on the genetically modified organisms, creating all these new proteins and things that
[2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:21.280]  are, according to scientists we've interviewed that are causing so many problems. I want to get
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:27.680]  into just kind of a laundry list covering a lot of subjects, what some of the more dangerous things
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:34.560]  are in foods we want to avoid, the Excited Toxins, not just aspartame and things like MSG, but some
[2:41:34.560 --> 2:41:38.240]  of the other things that are out there. Where would you like to start first, doctor?
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:48.320]  Well, I think what I need to probably start with is a discussion of how we came to what
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:54.400]  we call orthodox medicine in the United States, because it's a source of great confusion. People
[2:41:54.400 --> 2:41:59.520]  are now inundated with the idea of whether there's orthodox medicine, which is what we traditionally
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:05.280]  think of medicine and accept it, and then we have people working outside of orthodox medicine,
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:11.920]  which is sort of frowned on. That's the people doing nutrition, vitamins, minerals, herbs, uses,
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:19.840]  et cetera. And so you need to kind of understand who created orthodox medicine. Where did that come
[2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:27.920]  from? Well, it actually came from the Rockefeller Foundation back in 1901. The Rockefellers at
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:34.080]  the time, their family, because of the standard oil scandals, no one wanted to be called a
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:41.600]  Rockefeller. Everybody hated all the Rockefellers. And so his friend Reverend Gates went to John
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:47.760]  D. Rockefeller Sr. and told him, say, well, here's a way we can repair your reputation.
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:54.560]  And he gave him a good example. There was this man who everybody hated, just like they were
[2:42:54.560 --> 2:43:02.960]  hating you. And he started giving money out for all sorts of philanthropic enterprise. And soon
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:07.760]  people forgot all of the bad things. All they remembered was this philanthropy that he was
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:12.400]  pouring out. And he said, well, that's what we need to do with you. And so the first thing,
[2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:19.920]  because Gates' father was a physician, and John D. Rockefeller's father was a quack snake oil
[2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:26.800]  salesman, he said, let's form the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research. And so they created
[2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:34.160]  this in 1901. And so Rockefeller owned what was called the drug trust. That's the major drug
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:40.720]  manufacturing firms all over the world, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Letterly. All of these forms,
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:46.160]  these drug pharmaceutical companies. Because the Rockefellers, the Rockefellers understood
[2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:51.680]  taking over an entire industry and controlling the education system is the key to dominating
[2:43:51.680 --> 2:43:56.320]  societies. These are monopoly men. Right. And he also made himself a lot of money. And that's
[2:43:56.320 --> 2:44:03.360]  what Gates pointed out to him. Not only can we present this as philanthropy, but by promoting
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:11.120]  only drugs and the treatments that you promote as being so-called orthodox, they'll feed back
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:16.160]  into the companies that you own. And of course, what he did, he didn't always directly own companies.
[2:44:16.160 --> 2:44:20.080]  He would buy enough shares that he controlled them. Yeah, it's very simple for people that
[2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:22.960]  don't understand what you're saying. This is all part of the mainline history. You just,
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:26.000]  it isn't taught in the mainline textbooks, but it is there for those that want to know.
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:32.480]  They took over the education system and medicine to then direct the course of it into their own
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:38.800]  companies. Right. And the way he took over the medical education system at the time,
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:47.040]  he hired a person called Abraham Blexner. And he told him, what we need to do is have you study
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:54.160]  the medical schools in the United States and write a critique of it. And of course,
[2:44:54.160 --> 2:45:03.520]  the aim was to remove all nutrition references to nutritional type treatments from the medical
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:08.240]  schools. So they closed down half the medical schools in the United States. There were 165
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:13.920]  medical schools at the time. Well, he closed half of them. Then he had his anointed medical
[2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:19.840]  schools, which he poured his money into, appointed the professors from his own stock of professors.
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:26.080]  And so they created an educational system that taught the things that he wanted taught.
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:32.560]  And therefore, every professor that came out of those programs taught the same thing. So you
[2:45:32.560 --> 2:45:39.520]  established an orthodox training system where everybody was saying the same thing. Yeah,
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:44.400]  they call it now standardization, just like international bodies fund every county and
[2:45:44.400 --> 2:45:49.200]  city and fly around the city managers and social planners, where now all the zoning is the same,
[2:45:49.200 --> 2:45:54.160]  or the schools are the same, or the anti gun message is the same, or the anti sovereignty
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:45:58.880]  message. Everything is standardized. So this all goes back to them doing this with banking and
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:04.800]  then medicine and then energy. Please continue. Right. And if you look at the history of it,
[2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:09.600]  at all stem from Rockefeller, he did this in all of the segments that you've discussed,
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:15.280]  including the municipalities and the cities and villages so that he could control their
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:21.200]  government as well. What he now has absolute control of all the medical care in the United
[2:46:21.200 --> 2:46:26.480]  States as well as has moved out into the world. He made it international. And then when they have
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:33.360]  control of medicine, they can cover up by compartmentalizing and giving false data to the
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:38.240]  doctors who are compartmentalized and scientists, they can cover up their eugenics program to make
[2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:43.360]  sure that real doctors and scientists don't ever discovered it, correct? Right. And the thing is,
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:48.480]  Lily Kay wrote a book on this. It's the history of molecular medicine and the connection to
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:56.000]  Rockefeller Foundation and Caltech. It's a very in depth history of it. She's a professor of history,
[2:46:56.880 --> 2:47:02.240]  very well qualified and it's a very highly acclaimed history of molecular medicine
[2:47:02.240 --> 2:47:08.560]  and molecular biology. But in it, she makes the point that the Rockefeller Foundation created
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:16.480]  molecular biology with the aim of human engineering and social control. And that his
[2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:24.880]  goal was to eliminate people in the world who he felt was a bit for life and to change the minds
[2:47:25.840 --> 2:47:31.440]  and the thinking of people by using molecular biology. And then he pioneered the funding with
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:36.880]  the British of Mind War. That's what Hitler called it or propaganda. Right. He turned it
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:42.960]  internationally in 1950. What he did, he turned the domestic program over to Ford Foundation.
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:47.840]  And then he went international, mainly concentrating at Britain with their program of
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:54.240]  psychological warfare and psychological changing of thinking in mind. And Dr, I want to point something
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:58.400]  out. You and I didn't talk before the interview. We're not scripting this. You know, I bring up
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:03.040]  that it then moved to Britain and you continue with the documentation. Why? I don't come in and
[2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:08.480]  throw in little tidbits to show off that I know what's going on. I do that to show we're both
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:12.960]  saying the same thing as we read the same mainline history. This is what's really going on. They're
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:17.760]  poisoning you by design. We're going to get to that. Dr. Russell Blalock is our guest, an amazing
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:22.000]  individual. We're so honored to have him with us. We're going to come back and continue with what
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:28.160]  rules our world. Stay with us. Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:33.360]  cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are overly acidic
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:39.040]  due to stress, acidic diet and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:43.840]  and perfect health as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they drink
[2:48:43.840 --> 2:48:48.880]  experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity and loss of weight. It was intended for human
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:54.080]  beings to drink alkaline water. But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic. The
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:48:59.120]  fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates if a person
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:04.320]  consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it. Do your part. Alkalize
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:10.240]  and supercharge your body. Now, alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[2:49:10.240 --> 2:49:16.160]  that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops. Order your bottle
[2:49:16.160 --> 2:49:24.880]  of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com. Again, that's alcovision.com.
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:30.640]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against
[2:49:30.640 --> 2:49:36.960]  this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:41.760]  his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is
[2:49:41.760 --> 2:49:46.800]  the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:52.080]  the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[2:49:52.080 --> 2:49:59.120]  in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:04.480]  connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:09.280]  intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled
[2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:15.440]  Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:21.280]  titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:35.280]  I want everybody out there watching to listen to me very carefully. Everything Dr. Blalock,
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:44.400]  neurosurgeon, researcher, lecturer, peer-reviewed publisher is telling you is on the historical
[2:51:44.400 --> 2:51:50.720]  record. The eugenicists developed their plans in the 1850s. They took them into governmental control
[2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:58.320]  by the 1930s. They implemented it. The Nazis were just a spinoff of that. That's why all this
[2:51:59.040 --> 2:52:03.520]  is happening. That's why the poisoning of the population is happening. And they've got one
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:08.560]  comeback to all this. They say, well, population, you know, we're living longer in the United States.
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:13.840]  Well, that's not true. Infant mortality is way down. So if you take out infant mortality old
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:18.320]  numbers and what they're on average, depending on the decade, but going back 60, 70, 80, 100 years
[2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:23.120]  ago, 30, 40% of children would die by the age of five. If you take those numbers out, we aren't
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:28.320]  living as long. Look at Russia. They're living like 52 now. This is going on by design, by the
[2:52:28.320 --> 2:52:35.840]  social planners. So Dr. Blalock, please continue. You had gotten to 1950. They go totally international
[2:52:35.840 --> 2:52:43.280]  with it. Please continue. Well, as I said, they turned over the domestic behavioral sciences
[2:52:43.280 --> 2:52:51.840]  to the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation and its Carnegie Corporate Foundation
[2:52:52.560 --> 2:52:58.000]  turned their attention to the international arena to promote this social engineering
[2:52:58.800 --> 2:53:07.120]  with the Rockefeller 1920s coin, the science of man. Basically, it was eugenic because he was
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:16.000]  funding the majority of the eugenic organizations in the world in the 1910, 1920 period. Well,
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:21.040]  the Ford Foundation essentially is controlled by Rockefeller Foundation. Virtually all the major
[2:53:21.600 --> 2:53:26.960]  foundations are controlled by the Rockefeller Foundation. The way they did that is they had their
[2:53:28.800 --> 2:53:33.520]  people put in as trustees of these other foundations and eventually they took over control.
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:40.400]  So by interlocking, most of the major foundations, now the Bill Gates Foundation,
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:47.200]  is directly and indirectly controlled by the Rockefeller Foundation. Now, let me bring up
[2:53:47.200 --> 2:53:53.840]  the sources on that. The church hearings in Congress, as you know, in the in the 70s, went
[2:53:53.840 --> 2:53:58.160]  into the interlocking directorates and the different foundations. In another way, the Rockefellers
[2:53:58.160 --> 2:54:01.280]  back controlling government, if they didn't lack a foundation or they didn't play ball,
[2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:05.680]  they could shake regulators on them to selectively enforce rules to break them up or bring them
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:12.880]  under Rockefeller Allied control. Go ahead. Right. And by by regulating and controlling
[2:54:12.880 --> 2:54:18.400]  most of the major foundations, then they could have block grant, which they did. They directed
[2:54:18.400 --> 2:54:24.000]  their projects together toward a certain type of research. For instance, they were very interested
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:28.640]  in behaviorism, which is psychological control and human engineering,
[2:54:28.640 --> 2:54:36.320]  so by using that mass block of money, the other foundations were just very small
[2:54:37.520 --> 2:54:44.880]  and of no consequence. But they they trained these positions in the United States by
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:51.440]  targeting certain institutions. For instance, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Duke University,
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:59.200]  University of Wisconsin were targeted to be their institution, Caltech. And so they filled it with
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:05.520]  their people, with their agenda, their social planning agenda and social control agenda.
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:11.200]  And these people eventually became professors as well or sent their students as professors
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:18.560]  in foreign countries. So over the period of time, since 1901, they essentially taking over
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:23.440]  most of the major universities throughout the world through this interlocking directorate.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:28.240]  Now, to show how much money these people have, they they did something that was even
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:34.240]  more powerful. And that is, they made sure their people became the advisors for the government
[2:55:34.240 --> 2:55:40.320]  when the government was giving out money to these things. Because the psychological program
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:46.640]  funding by the federal government for exceeded the foundations in the 1950s and 60s. But it was
[2:55:46.640 --> 2:55:52.880]  the foundations that control the various governmental groups that were dispensing the money. So
[2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:56.720]  essentially, they controlled the government money, which is tax money. All right, stay there,
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:56:01.760]  doctor. Only a one minute break. Come right back to you as we start the fourth and final hour.

[2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:37.680]  Our guest under Russell Blalock, I'm gonna put his website up on the screen for you in a moment,
[2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:46.000]  is giving you the basic crash course in brain surgery in understanding
[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:50.720]  how our society is governed, how the map makers of the mind
[2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:54.320]  are controlling our society. Then we're gonna go into what they're building,
[2:57:54.320 --> 2:57:57.360]  the eugenics operation, the population reduction operation,
[2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:01.600]  they're carrying out against you and your family, whether you're an FBI agent,
[2:58:01.600 --> 2:58:07.520]  a police officer, a bureaucrat, and we're gonna get into some of the specific toxins and poisons
[2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:12.880]  that have been introduced into our environment. This is a quick segment. We're gonna come back
[2:58:12.880 --> 2:58:17.360]  in the long segment coming up in the about five minutes, but let's continue with Dr. Blalock.
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:25.440]  Dr. Blalock, please continue. Yeah, and continuing this line of their obsession with this,
[2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:32.560]  this science of changing the human behavior and what we call eventually behaviorism in the
[2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:39.120]  in the nineteen forty-eight fifty period. For instance, in nineteen twenty-eight in Cal Tech,
[2:58:39.120 --> 2:58:44.560]  they had a biology division. That's where Rockefeller first was funneling his money to
[2:58:44.560 --> 2:58:53.120]  create this science of man idea. And it was focused on eugenics, according to Dr. May.
[2:58:53.120 --> 2:58:57.040]  And she said that one of the professors there, Azra Ghazni,
[2:58:58.720 --> 2:59:04.240]  was in fact the leader in the eugenic movement. He was in the American Eugenics Society,
[2:59:04.240 --> 2:59:08.960]  the American Social Hygiene Society, Eugenics Research Association,
[2:59:08.960 --> 2:59:14.400]  and the Human Betterment Society, which was heavily funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:21.760]  And they mailed out tens of thousands of brochures that doctors, teachers, social workers,
[2:59:21.760 --> 2:59:27.520]  physicians, university publishers, all these different organizations to make sure that these
[2:59:27.520 --> 2:59:35.360]  ideas were in the minds of the American public and acceptable. And just to give you an idea of
[2:59:35.360 --> 2:59:40.640]  one of the things that this Dr. Ghazni wrote in Scientific American 1934,
[2:59:41.360 --> 2:59:49.440]  he was urging his readers to embrace Adolf Lorenz, Professor of Sociology in Vienna,
[2:59:50.320 --> 2:59:54.480]  with the idea that sterilization of the unfit would eventually reach all civilized
[2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:59.040]  countries as a means, quote, of getting rid of the scum of humanity.
[2:59:59.040 --> 3:00:06.880]  So this was a person who was in the Rockefeller Foundation. He was appointed as a professor of
[3:00:06.880 --> 3:00:12.800]  this new biology program, molecular biology program at Cal Tech. And he had a tremendous
[3:00:12.800 --> 3:00:19.600]  influence in training of professors that were teaching other biologists and eventually positions
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:24.400]  as well. And just to give you some of the quotes she gives in the book to show you that this is
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:31.600]  not just something I'm pulling out of thin air. In her book, she says in 1920s, Rockefeller conceived
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:38.160]  the idea of the science of man agenda. And she said, quote, the motivation behind the enormous
[3:00:38.160 --> 3:00:44.080]  investment was to develop human sciences as a comprehensive and applied framework of social
[3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:50.880]  control grounded in natural medical and social sciences, sciences, its aim was toward human
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:56.560]  engineering, the conjunction of cognitive and social goals had a strong historical connection
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:03.280]  to eugenics. So, you know, you can't make any plan. There's just quote after quote through the book
[3:01:03.280 --> 3:01:10.000]  in which she keeps saying over and over, his entire plan for this funding was not benevolent,
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:16.400]  it was to control human beings in the way they would think, to control human thought,
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:22.000]  and to get rid of people that he considered undesirable. Well, he had all the money at his
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:27.520]  disposal were from Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Lawrence Bellman
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:33.680]  Rockefeller Memorial, the Ford Foundation. So he had a massive amount of foundation money.
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:40.000]  In addition, as being advisors to the federal government, all of the money that the government
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:45.600]  was spending in these areas, which was much greater than even the foundation, was controlled
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:52.640]  by the foundation itself. So eventually today, they have the wealth of the entire world at their
[3:01:52.640 --> 3:01:58.640]  disposal to carry out these programs. We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:05.200]  over this planet to promote, and she even mentioned New World Order, which we said they
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:11.360]  helped design with the Council on Foreign Relations. So all of these things are well
[3:02:11.360 --> 3:02:18.000]  documented. It's not just something that you are making up like this. And doctor, it's horrifying.
[3:02:19.200 --> 3:02:23.040]  We've got a break, quick break, long segment coming up, sir. And it's just horrifying.
[3:02:23.040 --> 3:02:28.480]  This is Planet Eugenics. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's
[3:02:28.480 --> 3:02:32.800]  important to be self-sufficient. And today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent,
[3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:37.600]  and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:41.840]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any
[3:02:41.840 --> 3:02:46.400]  emergency if you simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail out
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:50.960]  of a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it. They turned off the telephones and
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:57.040]  email. They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air. This money now owns the American
[3:02:57.040 --> 3:03:02.000]  and European banks. The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:07.280]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans reach.
[3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:12.080]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days,
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:16.640]  until it reached over 4 billion marks. Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[3:03:16.640 --> 3:03:21.200]  there seems as if there may be no end in sight. The private banks, merging with our government,
[3:03:21.200 --> 3:03:25.520]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:30.000]  food but jack of prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to be
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:34.400]  prepared and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans have to choose
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:38.720]  between buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends, whatever it takes,
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:42.880]  get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out there listening, it's very
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:46.560]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the
[3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:51.680]  new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency
[3:03:51.680 --> 3:03:55.840]  and preparedness. No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:03:55.840 --> 3:04:00.240]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,

[3:04:38.160 --> 3:04:46.080]  because there's a war on for your mind. This is your life we're talking about here. This is the
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:53.200]  medical institutions, the colleges, the cities, the counties, all social engineering. Now the banks
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:58.720]  by design their own documents we've covered here at nauseam are imploding the economy by design
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:04.160]  to where you literally have to have a government job or work for a company being financed by the
[3:05:04.160 --> 3:05:09.760]  internationalist. Dr. Russell Blalock is our guest and coming up at the bottom of the hour we're
[3:05:09.760 --> 3:05:20.960]  going to open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231. Dr. Blalock we're continuing
[3:05:20.960 --> 3:05:24.720]  with the history here. I want to get into now what they're setting up, what their master plan is
[3:05:24.720 --> 3:05:29.840]  from your deep research, what their goal is because studying the world, studying history,
[3:05:30.560 --> 3:05:35.120]  doing this radio show it's been quite a journey for myself in 13 years because all of us that do
[3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:41.280]  research whether they're a neuro, top brain surgeon like yourself or a member of Congress like Ron
[3:05:41.280 --> 3:05:49.040]  Paul or we come to the same conclusion separately. This is the stated goal and I see just a microcosm
[3:05:49.040 --> 3:05:54.160]  example a few years ago it's in my film Endgame. The legislature was having hearings about why
[3:05:54.160 --> 3:05:57.760]  so many foster children were dying, why they were grabbing hundreds of thousands of children,
[3:05:58.400 --> 3:06:05.040]  million, a million point four nationwide every year, why 67% of children nationwide and in Texas
[3:06:05.040 --> 3:06:11.120]  the state average was the same as the national average here of 67% put on psychotropic drugs
[3:06:11.120 --> 3:06:16.800]  and the head of the psychiatry department association of Texas got up and said well they
[3:06:16.800 --> 3:06:21.760]  have bad gene pools so that's why we're doing this to these children and you run into any of these
[3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:26.800]  guys and I've been to a lot of events and they'll go yeah we're getting rid of people, humans are
[3:06:26.800 --> 3:06:31.920]  a disease we're a parasite and we the elite are getting rid of them and I tell the story my mother
[3:06:31.920 --> 3:06:37.600]  one time was riding with my father and myself when they were visiting me and they'd come into the
[3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:41.920]  office and seen part of Endgame a year and a half ago being finished and my mother said son I know
[3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:45.760]  you tell the truth about all this stuff and she's got a degree in history but she said I can't believe
[3:06:45.760 --> 3:06:50.480]  they really want to kill 80% of us and my dad had never told the story and he goes and you know he
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:54.080]  was a top student in high school and then went on this is when he was still in high school was
[3:06:54.080 --> 3:06:59.840]  taken to UT as part of this Academy of Sciences and they tested thousands of kids and he was down
[3:06:59.840 --> 3:07:04.800]  to the top six and they took him aside and said we want to send you to you know one of these top
[3:07:04.800 --> 3:07:09.520]  schools we want you to be part of the New World Order and we're going to carry out eugenics
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:13.760]  the public you know we've got to get rid of the majority of the population and my dad got out of
[3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:18.000]  at that point because you know he was well read in history so this is really sick and he thought of
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:23.280]  the Nazis but he never told us that and then I talked to other professionals they are recruiting
[3:07:23.280 --> 3:07:29.280]  the Kremlin of society as you just said earlier into this since the 30s in the western world please
[3:07:29.280 --> 3:07:35.200]  continue right and if you go into the New World Order she even makes this statement she said
[3:07:35.840 --> 3:07:42.000]  in December 1946 the special committee launched its new policy accommodating its work for a
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:47.760]  new world order efforts toward internationalism in other words they were at internationalizing
[3:07:47.760 --> 3:07:55.280]  this eugenics program now she says in 1945 because of the holocaust and the bad publicity that was
[3:07:55.280 --> 3:08:01.440]  spreading over the world of social planning and and eugenics they immediately told all of their
[3:08:01.440 --> 3:08:10.480]  people to get all of the references and our writing to social control social planning
[3:08:10.480 --> 3:08:16.960]  and eugenics out of it will just change the names that people won't recognize and she says this in
[3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:24.640]  her book and she's a major MIT uh johns hopkins train uh historian who this is this is crypto
[3:08:25.600 --> 3:08:30.480]  crypto eugenics they overnight changed all the names right they they uh
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:35.120]  selectively went out removed all these names so then their publications
[3:08:35.120 --> 3:08:41.120]  uh sounded very high getting getting rid of the infirm became the bioethicist movement
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:49.200]  on and on exactly and of course one of the most powerful of all the uh associations is the social
[3:08:49.200 --> 3:08:58.000]  sciences research council uh which rock fella formed back in i think 19 uh oh four 1907 something
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:04.800]  like that and now it is an enormously powerful organization that has a number it has something
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:11.200]  like i think in 1950 at 16 different foundations supporting it all of them rock a fella connected
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:16.480]  uh so they were pouring massive money into it and it virtually controlled the entire
[3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:22.640]  social sciences research not just in this country but all over the world and they're
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:27.600]  meanwhile were scouting for all the new brains to make sure that the brain trust was under their
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:35.520]  control exactly and by controlling education and controlling the media uh they made sure
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:40.640]  that people all conform to this way of thinking now here's the way they controlled the people who
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:46.240]  were uh dissidents in the intellectual world people in they were professors in the university
[3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:50.000]  didn't want to go along with they cut their funding off well they would cut their funding
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:54.800]  off make sure they never got a research grant if they were not tenured they made sure they were
[3:09:54.800 --> 3:10:03.440]  fired uh and uh what they also did to elevate their people to the to the highest rung of of
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:09.200]  being experts in the world is they would give them huge grants so they no longer had to bother
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:13.600]  with teaching students and they would publish their books and they would publish their books
[3:10:13.600 --> 3:10:17.760]  and make them rock stars in the medium and they reviewed their books and the journals that they
[3:10:17.760 --> 3:10:21.280]  controlled because they one of the things they did went out and controlled all the journals
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:28.880]  and so that then their people's books were reviewed with high praise any person who was a
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:35.040]  nonconformist their book was either not reviewed or given poor reviews and so when experts were
[3:10:35.040 --> 3:10:40.080]  asked for in a certain uh subject for the federal government they went to the the
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:48.400]  foundations expert they go to the cfr they go to the ssrc for an expert and so oh yes we have
[3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:54.000]  experts in that area we have experts in population control we have experts in and uh any subject
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:58.800]  that you want and of course it's all their people with all their philosophy and as you say a lot
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:05.200]  of this population control is buried in in the language uh for the general public not to recognize
[3:11:05.200 --> 3:11:11.360]  what and now we're living in really a hundred years of this 70 plus intensely uh you know
[3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:16.400]  continue with closing that gap from the 60s on into today and what the master plan is dr
[3:11:16.400 --> 3:11:22.800]  blalock from your deep research well the the plan is they they want to get rid of the population
[3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:28.240]  because what they realize is with technological advances we're not going to need all these workers
[3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:32.720]  i mean if you look at some of the modern plants uh have been in some of the big plants and you
[3:11:32.720 --> 3:11:39.280]  look at them and and there's a uh a room the size of uh three or four football fields and and there's
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:44.320]  a couple of dozen people working there because everything else is robotic and and electronic
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:50.000]  and technologically control and that's like bill joy that's like bill joy whenever he went
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:54.400]  back in 99 to a big technology conference and he's worth four billion bucks co-owner of sun
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:11:59.200]  microsystems and he came back and wrote an article why the future doesn't need us in wired magazine
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:03.280]  and he said look i met with the elite they're planning to kill everybody well they they don't
[3:12:03.280 --> 3:12:06.560]  need them and the other thing that you really said he said they don't need them because of the
[3:12:06.560 --> 3:12:11.520]  robotics well the thing you also realize when you read in the literature is they're scared of them
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:18.800]  because now you have a large segment of your population that's unemployed uh they become
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:24.720]  restless and then they're they're a danger to the the established order to the elite
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:30.000]  and so the the thing that they're trying to do is reduce population size to manage
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:35.360]  through various measures like birth control abortion uh you know all of these different
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:40.640]  methods the soft methods to get rid of people and then of course they're using over vaccination
[3:12:40.640 --> 3:12:46.720]  fluoride mercury all of these other things that increase mortality uh they're keeping
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:52.080]  treatments out of the uh medical world that that could save a lot of lives improve health
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:58.480]  because they they want people to die off that are not in the elite group now if you look back
[3:12:58.480 --> 3:13:02.960]  at the french revolution a lot of people don't know this and the french revolution one of the
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:08.800]  ideas was to kill most of the population of france and the idea was that we would have a group of
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:14.640]  elite and since we've killed 10 million people in france the rest of us would have all this land
[3:13:14.640 --> 3:13:22.080]  to ourselves a very small population and we'd have all the food we need uh and not these masses
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:28.640]  to worry about they want to go back they want to go back to nature and back to neo feudalism
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:34.000]  back to feudalism hence neo feudalism and and and just to back you up this all goes back to
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:43.280]  malthus in the 1750s then you have uh uh galton and others uh coming out with these very same
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:48.240]  plans and that's how and of course the elites of the planet the royalty love this this makes perfect
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:52.560]  sense to them but you even have these subgroups overthrowing royalty trying to go to a 10 day
[3:13:52.560 --> 3:13:57.680]  work week uh they were trying to overthrow the entire previous order and literally play god
[3:13:57.680 --> 3:14:03.840]  right exactly and they wrote about it openly back then you know now it's more disguised
[3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:08.240]  the they changed the language that most people wouldn't really recognize what they were talking
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:14.400]  about if you get some of these uh pamphlets and material from uh the social science research
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:19.360]  council uh if you don't know the code word if you don't know what they're talking about like
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:24.880]  sustainability if you don't understand what that means it sounds very benign it sounds very uh
[3:14:24.880 --> 3:14:30.880]  philanthropic a good thing to do but if you understand the code word what they're planning
[3:14:30.880 --> 3:14:37.200]  you realize it's absolute control uh it is planning means an elite controls your life
[3:14:38.160 --> 3:14:43.520]  and to put it on a scale that people can understand all this this new uh move toward uh
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:50.560]  imminent domain where they come in and take a man's business and say well for the public good
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:56.480]  if we tear down his business and build a a high rise there or our shopping center will have a
[3:14:56.480 --> 3:15:01.840]  bigger tax base and so they use imminent domain to take his property well that's central planning
[3:15:02.400 --> 3:15:08.240]  that's social planning and their total rationale doesn't matter and their total rationale is social
[3:15:08.240 --> 3:15:12.880]  Darwinism they believe that it's not horrible to kill people or enslave them or inject them with
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:19.680]  cancer viruses in the vaccines it is good because uh they are have the right of kings to do whatever
[3:15:19.680 --> 3:15:25.280]  they want because they're in the elite position that is prima facie evidence of their genetic
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:31.120]  superiority but that's exactly right and this is exactly what dr k says in her in her history book
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:36.720]  of molecular biology that that was always their thought that we're the elite we're the best gene
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:43.600]  and therefore we should do human engineering the new science of man so we reduce population
[3:15:43.600 --> 3:15:51.520]  to those of us who number one uh you know have the elite minds the pure genetics and then we'll
[3:15:51.520 --> 3:15:57.280]  keep a small core of people to do the menial tasks that we don't want to do and they even wrote about
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:03.200]  keep these people uneducated because there's no need to educate them they're going to be doing
[3:16:03.200 --> 3:16:08.480]  menial tasks and uh you know it's interesting reading these things because they were so open
[3:16:08.480 --> 3:16:14.000]  about it and there's quite a few books on social control that written in the 20s and 30s that openly
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:19.840]  talk about these Edward Bernays and others stay there dr blalock quick break we're gonna come

[3:20:49.120 --> 3:20:57.360]  i own close to 50 or so original source government textbooks and foundation textbooks where they say
[3:20:57.360 --> 3:21:03.440]  they're going to exterminate us the united nations biological diversity assessment in 96
[3:21:03.440 --> 3:21:10.560]  in 89 this is all public it's just not widely known this is true this is real what we're talking
[3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:18.160]  about they want us dead and they are spraying us the gmo you know there's hundreds of different
[3:21:18.160 --> 3:21:25.200]  types of plastics they can make it expensively they chose the one formula that releases these
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:31.040]  toxins these endocrine disruptors that manipulate our hormone levels why did they choose that one
[3:21:31.040 --> 3:21:37.120]  type for universal adoption worldwide and sell the factory formulas and machines and systems
[3:21:37.120 --> 3:21:40.960]  sometimes in a loss to make sure that was implemented in the 50s then we see the sperm
[3:21:40.960 --> 3:21:45.600]  counts drop we see the fertility problems why do they approve the bovine growth hormone
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:48.960]  to put in the milk when they know it was linked to the cancer and all these problems
[3:21:48.960 --> 3:21:53.600]  why do they put mercury in vaccines you know we've gotten up to the point of their master plan
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:58.720]  dr. blalock this is a short segment i want to come back in the next long segment and take some calls
[3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:05.200]  from jen and sherry and robert and brad and dr tracy and others that are holding uh but uh
[3:22:05.200 --> 3:22:08.560]  any other i mean there's so many we talked for 10 hours i'm gonna have you back if you'll grace
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:14.640]  us with your time to warn people i mean what do we do about this i mean we're here trying to warn
[3:22:14.640 --> 3:22:21.840]  folks this is real this affects everybody except for a few thousand elitist who even write about
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:25.600]  how they know they're being hurt by the blowback but it's okay for the greater work they're doing
[3:22:25.600 --> 3:22:32.240]  i mean how do we counter this well it's very difficult because like i say they have the
[3:22:32.240 --> 3:22:38.000]  entire wealth of the world at their disposal they essentially control all the media i mean back in
[3:22:38.000 --> 3:22:46.800]  1950 uh a guy by the name of uh manual uh joseph who was a uh joseph yeah joseph and who was a
[3:22:47.360 --> 3:22:52.960]  medical doctor he wrote a book on on rockefeller that's quite detailed very well documented
[3:22:52.960 --> 3:23:00.880]  and uh he talks about these things in that book as well how the rockefeller uh was absolutely
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:06.800]  obsessed with controlling all information that's available to the public and the way he did it
[3:23:06.800 --> 3:23:14.880]  even back then he was spending uh something like 250 million dollars uh controlling the media
[3:23:14.880 --> 3:23:23.280]  and by being uh the major controlling force in literally hundreds if not thousands of corporations
[3:23:23.920 --> 3:23:30.960]  all of which advertised in the major media uh by 1950s all the major media was dependent
[3:23:30.960 --> 3:23:37.200]  on their advertising dollar so anything he wanted uh in the media and anything he didn't
[3:23:37.200 --> 3:23:42.880]  want in the media all he had to do is let them know well you would lose your funding if that's
[3:23:42.880 --> 3:23:47.840]  discussed and a lot of other mainstream media was owned by allies by like william randolph
[3:23:47.840 --> 3:23:52.560]  Hearst doctor let's take this tack for a moment and then continue with any other points you had on
[3:23:52.560 --> 3:23:59.200]  that first question there are elitist and want to be elitist a lot of these minion professors and
[3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:04.640]  i use the local awesome example of dr eric pionka he gives speeches it's been in the news where he
[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:10.240]  says we need to kill 90 percent of the public and the new the the point is they get 95 standing
[3:24:10.240 --> 3:24:15.200]  ovations he power points a huge thing of skulls with a red filter on the wall this has been on
[3:24:15.200 --> 3:24:21.760]  national news and everybody claps and the scientists cry and and he goes and speaks to the royal
[3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:26.800]  academy in england into the big you know royal academies in the most prestigious academies uh
[3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:32.080]  in france uh you know i know you've written papers and spoken to some of those big groups as well
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:37.520]  but the point is and and the majority of them start crying this has been in the newspaper
[3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:41.760]  because this is their religion what do you want to say to those people listening
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:45.760]  i mean what would be your counter and your argument to them i mean reaching out to them
[3:24:45.760 --> 3:24:51.040]  and going my god look what you've done i mean trying to get them to come over to our side of
[3:24:51.040 --> 3:24:58.000]  humanity well that you know this is the collectivist idea and we're steeped in collectivism this
[3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:05.280]  this was the whole program of uh virtually ever president since the civil war is the gradual
[3:25:05.280 --> 3:25:10.240]  implementation of collectivism in the united states and collectivism basically says the
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:17.200]  individual doesn't matter what matters is the uh community well community doesn't really mean a
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:25.040]  lot if you listen to communist jargon they say uh the people we speak for the people well this
[3:25:25.040 --> 3:25:32.240]  mythological people is nobody if whoever's in charge whoever owns the gun and so the government
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:37.040]  owns all the power and so they speak for the people they speak for the public so when you hear
[3:25:37.040 --> 3:25:41.920]  them saying this is for the good of the public or this is good for them and then in reality the the
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:48.560]  the eugenicists the communists they always kill the people because they hate the people well they
[3:25:48.560 --> 3:25:53.440]  fear the people you know historically if you look at every dictatorship what eventually happened
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:59.440]  if they come to fear the people because they know that what they're doing is unpopular and not
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:04.560]  working and then they fear revolution yes and this is what happens with collectivism in the united
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:10.320]  states is it becomes more and more collective people recognize the elitist is now what's causing
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:17.120]  my my financial failure or the leaders are what's causing uh you know whatever bad is the parasite
[3:26:17.120 --> 3:26:20.880]  stand there doctor stand there we gotta break we'll be right back on this quick break without a

[3:32:03.840 --> 3:32:10.480]  you heard fox news saying children are bad this is the program i want to tell the police and
[3:32:10.480 --> 3:32:15.440]  military that serve the new world order most of you don't understand this you better learn it you
[3:32:15.440 --> 3:32:19.680]  are being poisoned and killed as well at your playlock i want to go to calls but let's say you
[3:32:19.680 --> 3:32:25.200]  had three minutes on national tv to address the public about the program the toxins the poisons
[3:32:25.200 --> 3:32:30.640]  what's in their food and water and how to avoid it if you had three minutes to boil it down and
[3:32:30.640 --> 3:32:35.520]  warn people because this will be seen it's being is being heard by millions you know watch on the
[3:32:35.520 --> 3:32:40.480]  web right now by thousands it'll be seen by millions in the aggregate just in the next few weeks
[3:32:40.480 --> 3:32:45.760]  as folks put this interview out everywhere you've got three minutes before we go to call sir
[3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:50.080]  what is most important for people to know about how dire this is how real this is
[3:32:51.840 --> 3:32:57.360]  well what they need to know is that the authorities the people who are defending these things like
[3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:04.960]  vaccination that the marisol the florida in the water they never have a defense against the charges
[3:33:04.960 --> 3:33:11.120]  that are being made they never even attempt to answer these questions uh when i uh challenged
[3:33:11.120 --> 3:33:17.120]  these people on vaccination they won't even appear on radio uh to challenge me i did that in hawaii
[3:33:17.120 --> 3:33:23.520]  we challenged the public health to come on and and debate what i had to say they wouldn't even appear
[3:33:23.520 --> 3:33:27.600]  because i know something that the other people talking about vaccines are not talking about
[3:33:27.600 --> 3:33:33.760]  and that is when you vaccinate with these large numbers of vaccine it activates the brain
[3:33:33.760 --> 3:33:39.520]  special immune system and will destroy the connections in the brain alter the development
[3:33:39.520 --> 3:33:44.240]  of the brain and this is why we're seeing so many of these brain disorders uh and learning
[3:33:44.240 --> 3:33:51.120]  difficulties in our children now these things are backed up by enormous research uh thousands of
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:57.040]  studies all over the world uh by independent researchers it's not that the research is not
[3:33:57.040 --> 3:34:02.400]  there and the proof is not there is that the media won't carry it uh none of the major
[3:34:02.400 --> 3:34:09.280]  publications will carry this story they won't interview you they don't want to have this exposed
[3:34:09.280 --> 3:34:15.840]  so we're having to use the other outlets like the alex jones show and uh to get this to the public
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:21.760]  it's very well uh documented if you look at my website you'll see a lot of references you read
[3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:27.360]  my book everything is referenced uh in the scientific literature it's all peer-reviewed
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:33.360]  journals uh from some of the biggest laboratories in the in the world uh but they don't want you
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:41.680]  to know these things uh and so uh you know people need to wake up and realize you're being fed a
[3:34:41.680 --> 3:34:48.320]  lot of propaganda you're being controlled uh by propaganda and this is absolutely proven the
[3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:55.120]  reese committee 1950 federal government investigation uh the foundation proved this beyond the shadow
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:02.880]  of doubt uh you can get that book uh the foundation the power and influence by uh warmser who was the
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:08.480]  general counsel for the reese committee it's all proven in there the control that i'm talking about
[3:35:09.040 --> 3:35:15.120]  uh the book that i've talked about by dr k on molecular biology history it's all documented in
[3:35:15.120 --> 3:35:21.920]  there uh so the documents are there people need to quit watching uh football games all the time and
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:30.720]  and and garbage on the television and and and realize this is a very serious uh abridgment of
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:37.920]  our freedom we're seeing the rise of a world totalitarian government and if we don't wake up
[3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:42.960]  and start doing something now it's going to be irreversible because like i said they have the
[3:35:42.960 --> 3:35:49.280]  wealth of the world on their side they have the media uh they have hollywood they have publishing
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:56.880]  firm they've taken over a hundred years to institute this but very carefully but the public
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:01.200]  is finally starting to figure out the basics that they're being lied to so there's a loss of
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:06.000]  confidence with congress one example with a nine percent approval rating we have to move in now
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:09.920]  while folks are finally listening and warn them as you're doing and that's why we salute you very
[3:36:09.920 --> 3:36:15.680]  well said dr blalock uh before we go to these calls i just want to point out to the military the
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:20.320]  police the bureaucrats those that enforce this so many of them i talked to or that email me
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:23.920]  they laugh and they say so what if it's all true i'm part of the elite
[3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:30.240]  they're all under the same attack and there's no reason that ninety nine percent of the public
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:36.720]  wouldn't have a stake in fighting back against this i mean you know the final problem is people
[3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:43.280]  just have trouble dealing with the magnitude but this is the nature of our world today and this
[3:36:43.280 --> 3:36:48.720]  is what we're facing how do you see well you know if they think they're the elite they need to read
[3:36:48.720 --> 3:36:54.960]  the history of the soviet union uh all the people who were responsible for bringing the soviet union
[3:36:54.960 --> 3:37:04.160]  to power were killed all of them the entire uh virtually the entire uh nkvd uh in the beginning
[3:37:04.160 --> 3:37:08.480]  was wiped out that's your police that's the people who were doing the killing initially they thought
[3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:14.640]  they were protected they were all killed the head of the nkvd was murdered so you know the same
[3:37:14.640 --> 3:37:19.680]  thing with hitlers they're fooling them itself same thing with the nazis and then they get rid of
[3:37:20.320 --> 3:37:24.720]  same thing with the nazis now the long knives right because they cannot be trusted if you read
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:30.960]  soviet literature the first thing they tell you is the revolutionaries that bring us about
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:36.480]  can't be trusted because when they see they lied to then they want to revolt so they have to kill
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:43.440]  them all for put them in gulag well what did caesar do after he got power it's it's throughout all
[3:37:43.440 --> 3:37:49.040]  of world history from the very beginning it is like as i said it when we're talking about the
[3:37:49.040 --> 3:37:54.240]  talentering gun the first thing that happens they're feared the people they fear their own special
[3:37:54.240 --> 3:38:01.840]  police uh so they periodically have a purge they get rid of well if you study special forces after
[3:38:01.840 --> 3:38:05.840]  they've used special forces for dirty deeds all over the world they always set them up or put a
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:11.520]  conviction on them to discredit them so they can't ever speak out or they kill them right i mean this
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:15.600]  is so horrible well god bless you i want to take some calls here in the final 20 minutes we have
[3:38:15.600 --> 3:38:23.200]  left dr blalock but for those that aren't watching on prison planet dot tv verbally i give folks again
[3:38:23.200 --> 3:38:27.680]  your website so they can check it out and hopefully you've got some ways for people to try to protect
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:33.920]  themselves and we know they're now spraying us and we know i've got mainstream news about garpa
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:40.720]  and mainstream papers saying they're going to put up towers with ultrasound to to to to soothe the
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:48.160]  public during crises have you seen this research where they're yeah you see they they had this uh
[3:38:48.160 --> 3:38:55.120]  decade of the brain uh they are pouring literally billions of dollars into neuroscience research
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:39:02.480]  a lot of it is designed and how to control people's thinking and if you if you read delgado's book who
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:08.880]  was a a very highly regarded neurophysiologist who did depth electrode studies on the brain
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:15.280]  how to control behavior and in his book he said the last refuge of the individual is his own mind
[3:39:15.280 --> 3:39:21.680]  and they're after that they want that last refuge to your thoughts for no longer be your thought
[3:39:21.680 --> 3:39:27.200]  and they're using this massive investment in neuroscience to figure out how to do that and
[3:39:27.200 --> 3:39:32.160]  a lot of these techniques are what they're doing things to make people apathetic things to make
[3:39:32.160 --> 3:39:39.680]  people you know i have a friend of mine who worked for the the uh nsa as a debrief of soviet
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:44.080]  factors and he told me about all the different drugs they had discovered that could make you
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:50.320]  change your entire attitude where anti-communist would become communist it would completely reverse
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:56.800]  everything you you believed in uh that these drugs existed and and they're even more sophisticated
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:40:02.640]  now and techniques are more sophisticated now and delgado said you know i no longer have to
[3:40:02.640 --> 3:40:09.200]  imprint electrodes as people said we could do it at a distance uh by uh methods like you just
[3:40:09.200 --> 3:40:14.160]  discussed well that's right back in the 1950s they had these patented in the us alone and not to
[3:40:14.160 --> 3:40:19.280]  mention what's classified but the thing i saw like seven years ago it was in the baltimore sun
[3:40:19.280 --> 3:40:23.680]  they said oh darpa that invented the internet they're putting up towers to soothe the public and it
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:30.080]  was like a weird test bubble and then and then it says uh this is out of spectrum online uh which
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:35.760]  is a uh for tech insiders mainline magazine and it says how great it is that oh sound waves for
[3:40:35.760 --> 3:40:41.360]  brain waves when it says they can control the public and then i have cbs newscast where they
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:46.480]  say they're going to start doing this to prisoners to reform them i mean this is open mind control
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:52.640]  the towers are now up and you tell people this and they roll their eyes at you well it's absolutely
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:58.560]  true i can tell you i've spent a lot of time reading neuroscience literature and uh these
[3:40:58.560 --> 3:41:04.400]  techniques are being developed and the government is very very interested in it and it's being
[3:41:04.400 --> 3:41:10.240]  funded by these major foundation unbelievable this has always been a dream of theirs is to control
[3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:17.840]  human thinking well the pentagon says 90 of war is mind war now right and and and and folks i mean
[3:41:17.840 --> 3:41:22.240]  we're not in kansas anymore we're in a lot of trouble let's take some calls gin in georgia
[3:41:22.240 --> 3:41:29.920]  you're on the air welcome hello hi you're on the air with dr blalock hi um oh my goodness i'm
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:35.200]  getting really excited finally he got my pick my call i'm trying to collect my thoughts together
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:41.920]  well um sorry to be a little off topic because i don't have any questions for the doctor right
[3:41:41.920 --> 3:41:46.480]  now be real quick then i'm gonna move on to some other folks i'll be real quick i have a question
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:53.120]  about the previous guest that was on your show um he was the author who wrote the book about obama
[3:41:53.120 --> 3:42:01.760]  being a postmodern coup now that's that's webster tarpling yeah webster yeah him well he said that
[3:42:01.760 --> 3:42:07.520]  well on previous shows i don't know exactly what date he was on the show and he said that
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:14.000]  over 40 percent of people who voted against obama voted against fascism when in fact
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  i don't think at least referring to the people who voted for john mccain ma'am ma'am that is not
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:24.080]  true listen i appreciate your call uh we're we're we're i'm trying to take calls pretty much
[3:42:24.080 --> 3:42:29.600]  for uh the doctor let me try to explain something there's a psychological dictatorship we're living
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:35.200]  in a highly controlled scientifically designed the elite openly call it the the final revolution
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:39.920]  okay where uh in the words of urchin russell who said they would inject us with mercury to
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:45.280]  brain damages at birth he said he would a rebellion by the proletariat the general public
[3:42:45.280 --> 3:42:51.040]  would be as impossible as a rebellion of sheep against the practice of eating mutton or lamb
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:57.040]  chops they see us we're almost at that point where the it isn't about obama you know he's
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:02.800]  a puppet mccain's a puppet he we're pointing out that obama is the heir apparent pat robertson's
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:08.800]  now endorsing him to fool the people to to going along with the next phase of collectivism dr
[3:43:08.800 --> 3:43:16.000]  blalock absolutely agree absolutely agree that he you know everybody looks at the president the
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:24.160]  president is an empty suit uh he's being manipulated by uh the foundation they decide policy uh the
[3:43:24.160 --> 3:43:29.040]  president doesn't the congress doesn't nobody in the government really makes any decisions
[3:43:29.040 --> 3:43:35.760]  and if you look at congress now they're paralyzed i talked to bob bar privately a couple years ago
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:40.480]  and i asked him i said when they stole all these fbi files is that what's keeping congress under
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:45.040]  control he said absolutely he said they have dirt on everybody they know what everybody's
[3:43:45.040 --> 3:43:50.240]  done and they're all terrified to resist any way and that's what the surveillance states about
[3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:57.280]  okay uh ma'am look it's way past that okay it's it's it's it's way past that was that jen or sherry
[3:43:57.280 --> 3:44:04.320]  i just went to okay i'm sorry i was calling jen sherry now we go to sherry i apologize sherry
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:09.840]  you're on the air go ahead hi alice hi dr blalock um i have a question for you doctor
[3:44:09.840 --> 3:44:17.680]  um is there any legitimate medical reason why 67 percent of children and you know foster care
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:23.280]  would be on those drugs would there be any reason besides total control the federal government says
[3:44:23.280 --> 3:44:29.920]  it's for eugenics but i'm i'm sorry go ahead dr blalock now on a drugs for what 67 percent
[3:44:29.920 --> 3:44:36.400]  a national average of foster children are on ssri's oh yeah and you know if you look in the
[3:44:36.400 --> 3:44:42.000]  the physician's death reference it says that uh children shouldn't be on ssri that they induce
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:51.520]  uh psychosis they introduce a higher incidence of suicide homicidal thought pattern uh so they
[3:44:51.520 --> 3:44:58.720]  know that uh the ssri is a very bad medication and if the fba was real if it was really a regulatory
[3:44:58.720 --> 3:45:04.000]  agency it would have been removed the longer ago and doctor as you know in the trials of the first
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:12.080]  big one uh by illa lily in the early 1980s of uh the ssri prozac they admitted internally that it
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:18.080]  caused massive increases in psychopathic breaks homicide suicide but they want to improve yourself
[3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:24.400]  because i remember correctly right yes um yeah we see this is what i talk about in the family
[3:45:24.400 --> 3:45:30.080]  nutrition and behavior is that most of the things we see in children that have to do with abnormal
[3:45:30.080 --> 3:45:37.520]  behavior are due to a poor diet and toxin exposure and that if you change that most of these children
[3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:43.440]  undergo a radical improvement in their behavior and by the way let me stop you let me stop you
[3:45:43.440 --> 3:45:47.920]  even mainline studies that you see in the press occasionally admit that getting them off dies
[3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:54.320]  getting them off process sugars getting them exercise has massive you know better numbers than prozac
[3:45:54.320 --> 3:45:58.800]  which they even show is detrimental go ahead well all this is then in the mainline peer review
[3:45:58.800 --> 3:46:04.800]  journal it's not uh you know from something in alternative medicine this is the mainline medicine
[3:46:04.800 --> 3:46:09.680]  did you see the latest fact that most physicians don't read this did you see the latest the
[3:46:09.680 --> 3:46:16.160]  research journal they're not even aware of this did you see the latest number from 2008 that 100
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:22.880]  million prescriptions for ssri's in 2008 and in the u.s. oh absolutely and when bush had the program
[3:46:22.880 --> 3:46:27.600]  where it's going to have all the children examined psychologically and have them placed on medication
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:32.480]  if they needed it new freedom is absurd that's not the function of the federal government
[3:46:32.480 --> 3:46:38.880]  to have people psychologically evaluated but they don't medication but that's what is dangerous as
[3:46:38.880 --> 3:46:46.720]  fsri medicate but that's what the eugenicist aldis huxley whose brother later ran the un
[3:46:46.720 --> 3:46:50.240]  julian huxley became the head of the eugenic society and the head of the transhumanist
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:56.000]  he said they would drug the public that's where thx 1138 and brave new world come from because
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:47:00.640]  that was the plan and now they've got a hundred million people on them sure i mean in in the
[3:47:00.640 --> 3:47:05.440]  book brave new world it talked about the drug soma and that you would calm people down and then
[3:47:05.440 --> 3:47:09.920]  you'd have another drug to try them when you wanted to be excited and uh when you want an
[3:47:09.920 --> 3:47:15.840]  aesthetic uh you put them back on the soma again and now they even have an ssri on the market doctor
[3:47:15.840 --> 3:47:23.440]  called soma actually you know and then his book brave new world resisted it is uh goes into the
[3:47:23.440 --> 3:47:27.920]  mind fiction description of all of these things hold on doctor we're going to skip this break for
[3:47:27.920 --> 3:47:33.920]  prison planet dot tv viewers stay with us ladies and gentlemen info wars dot com have you ever thought
[3:47:33.920 --> 3:47:38.240]  about what's yeah i'm gonna skip this break network okay thank you uh anything else you
[3:47:38.240 --> 3:47:43.760]  wanted to add sherry in texas to dr blaylock no that was it that uh pretty much answered
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:47:49.040]  answer my question for me thank you okay thank you robert in california robert you're on the
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:59.120]  year go ahead hello yes sir hi um dr blaylock um i have a question regarding vaccines um
[3:47:59.120 --> 3:48:05.280]  what would you recommend to people who've already taken vaccines uh like natural chelation natural
[3:48:05.280 --> 3:48:13.040]  therapy uh something along those lines uh well you know if you've taken back things that have
[3:48:13.040 --> 3:48:19.040]  mercury i would recommend being tested for mercury right how about how about people who who can't
[3:48:19.040 --> 3:48:26.880]  really afford seeing a doctor or well the hair testing would for most people would be sufficient
[3:48:26.880 --> 3:48:31.760]  isn't it very inexpensive so comparatively it's very inexpensive and you don't need a doctor's
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:38.640]  permission to do it uh so you can get your hair tested for mercury level so he does have higher
[3:48:38.640 --> 3:48:43.840]  so he does have higher mercury what does he do well uh you know a lot of things neutralize mercury
[3:48:43.840 --> 3:48:48.320]  toxicity in the brain because it's very difficult and some people think impossible to remove mercury
[3:48:48.320 --> 3:48:56.160]  from the brain uh once it's in the ionic form uh selenium neutralizes mercury toxicity uh querc
[3:48:56.160 --> 3:49:01.920]  it's in the helps neutralize it means it flavonoids like curcumin well all these things are available
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:08.160]  now as supplement right how about how about hormones i know you take several hormones um
[3:49:08.160 --> 3:49:14.880]  how about those with uh like low thyroid what would you recommend uh well you you know if you
[3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:19.360]  have low thyroid of course you need you need supplementation to bring it back up to normal
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:26.400]  right um but uh you know removing at dmsa you can use it uh as a very slow removal
[3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:34.320]  over a long period of time alpha lipoic acid uh helps uh remove uh mercury from the brain so
[3:49:34.320 --> 3:49:40.960]  this magnesium uh increases mercury removal from the brain and one of the safest and easiest to
[3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:47.120]  do is uh aged garlic extract right which over a long period of time removes it how about liquid
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:53.840]  zeolites uh well i've talked to boyd hayley he thinks that's a lot of bologna but he says it's
[3:49:53.840 --> 3:49:58.480]  too large a molecule to get into yeah look we're out of time we're out of time i appreciate your
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:01.760]  call robert we're about to come back to the full audience i want to plug your website again
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:07.200]  under blaylock we're just for the internet only right now i was in a restaurant the other night
[3:50:07.200 --> 3:50:10.160]  i whipped in to get something to eat alone there were three different groups of people sitting
[3:50:10.160 --> 3:50:13.920]  around me one group was talking about they were not that old of women middle aged i'm at all
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:18.560]  their health problems in one group two other groups were talking about how they all had thyroid
[3:50:18.560 --> 3:50:24.000]  problems so what is going on with thyroid and what's causing that well one of the biggest
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:29.920]  uh offenders is fluoride you know they used to use fluoride a long time ago to treat hyperthyroidism
[3:50:30.560 --> 3:50:35.920]  well of all their glands in the body the thyroid accumulates the highest concentration of fluoride
[3:50:35.920 --> 3:50:40.880]  it's much higher than any other organ so it is a uh you know that it's in the water and you're
[3:50:40.880 --> 3:50:46.480]  drinking it every day you're accumulating a huge amount of fluoride in the thyroid we're going back
[3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:55.360]  to the full audience full audience here we go man this show has gone by really fast i've i've got
[3:50:55.360 --> 3:50:59.440]  to have the doctor back up for another hour and a half two hours in the near future this radio
[3:50:59.440 --> 3:51:03.360]  transmission is almost over and i want to go to brad and somebody calling themselves dr tracy
[3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:10.320]  we'll guess they're a doctor of some type uh but briefly uh dr blalock uh fire out uh your
[3:51:11.120 --> 3:51:14.960]  website again for folks to get books and videos on these subjects all right it's
[3:51:14.960 --> 3:51:25.920]  russell blalock md.com r u s s e l l b l a y l o d k m d dot com and you can get to the books

[3:55:46.640 --> 3:55:56.960]  it just a few minutes oh right now yes we're on air okay i'm sorry um what i'd like to say
[3:55:56.960 --> 3:56:04.800]  is that everything that the dr blalock has said is true they are killing people at an incredible
[3:56:04.800 --> 3:56:13.280]  rate and if your listeners are not aware of hospice and how they are going in and euthanizing
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:22.160]  many of the elderly they need to go to hospicepatients.org because it's happening hospicepatients.org
[3:56:22.160 --> 3:56:27.760]  well that's even been in the wall street journal uh with the uh smith articles about how the people
[3:56:27.760 --> 3:56:34.400]  are chained down begging for food and water doctor exactly dr blalock they're bringing
[3:56:34.400 --> 3:56:38.720]  dachow and ush with right in the people's home dr blalock you were trying to say something
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:47.120]  no i was just listening and i think uh dr tracy but you know we we have to be a lot more alert to
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:52.560]  these things because they have very benign sounding names a lot of these things and they
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:58.880]  they promote themselves as uh somebody who wants to do good and help uh with the problems of
[3:56:58.880 --> 3:57:05.840]  society but you know you have to be very critical uh in your in your observation to pick up these
[3:57:05.840 --> 3:57:11.360]  things dr tracy send an email to erin with two a's and info wars dot com is producing right now
[3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:14.800]  and i do remember interviewing you now years ago it's been years and years and perhaps we'll
[3:57:14.800 --> 3:57:19.200]  have you back on and send that hospice address because i do want to cover how they're killing the
[3:57:19.200 --> 3:57:23.520]  elderly and uh in firm i don't people here in austin who have their parents taken away and they
[3:57:23.520 --> 3:57:28.320]  just go euthanize them you know kill them with morphine and and and dr blalock again i just
