[00:38.900 --> 00:44.080]  parading nuns that they've captured from burnout Catholic churches in the
[00:44.080 --> 00:49.400]  streets of Cairo and our controlled media here in the United States is the
[00:49.400 --> 00:55.640]  only media in the world that is actually siding with the Muslim Brotherhood
[00:55.640 --> 01:00.640]  absolutely incredible because they will destabilize that region and that is the
[01:00.640 --> 01:06.320]  game plan Islamists mob parades nuns in Cairo as prisoners of war after six
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.240]  hours looting church school and replacing cross with banner resembling
[01:11.240 --> 01:16.520]  Al Qaeda flag absolutely that's out of the daily mail it's up on drudgereport.com

[01:24.240 --> 01:27.800]  phones up today not that I don't have literally over a hundred news articles
[01:27.800 --> 01:32.320]  here that all need to be covered and we will get into all of that we've got
[01:32.320 --> 01:39.000]  dr. Russell Blalock joining us to get into now the fact that Obamacare is
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.040]  being implemented everything he warned people about is unfolding and he's got
[01:43.040 --> 01:46.840]  masses of doctors retiring to get away from this nightmare we'll also get his
[01:46.840 --> 01:51.400]  take on Coca-Cola running ads saying aspartame is good for you

[02:03.280 --> 02:12.600]  transmission today now we also have another article here on independent
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.200]  Rupert Murdoch buys into alternative media with 70 million dollar slice of
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.840]  vice I remember five years ago when vice started they first came interviewed us
[02:20.840 --> 02:26.960]  two guys and because they cover trendy news along with conspiracies they're
[02:26.960 --> 02:31.760]  now one of the hottest things out there and and and I've never really gone this
[02:31.760 --> 02:35.480]  path though when I have done it occasionally it's been quite successful
[02:35.480 --> 02:41.440]  and I I think that I mean I told the guys like five years ago this was the
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.560]  case but we just haven't really done it we need to hijack popular culture more
[02:46.560 --> 02:51.960]  but then infuse Liberty information into it and I'm saying this the whole
[02:51.960 --> 02:56.600]  Liberty movement instead of just hey let's go show people drilling holes in
[02:56.600 --> 03:03.120]  their heads for fun or you know people taking an amnesic drug to or giving
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.280]  people amnesic drugs to rob them and that's old news but people like vice
[03:07.280 --> 03:11.760]  take it and make it new news what's old news is new news what's interesting news
[03:11.760 --> 03:18.240]  is important but then inject I would take an article about scopolamine and say
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.800]  but what about other given scopolamine to the troops after they carried
[03:22.800 --> 03:26.880]  operations to not remember what they did massacres a form of mind-controller what
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.920]  about how they're giving them Halcyon another amnesic see that's how my brain
[03:31.920 --> 03:39.160]  works is take something popular that's admitted and then tie it to not just ABC
[03:39.160 --> 03:43.880]  DEFG but right down to Z to get people thinking and doing stuff like a Don

[10:49.560 --> 10:55.320]  media the globalist kleptocrat prostitute media decepticon media parrot
[10:55.320 --> 11:01.040]  media state-run media it's no longer MSM mainstream media it's state-run
[11:01.040 --> 11:09.560]  media SRM that's it it is state-run media ladies and gentlemen and everybody
[11:09.560 --> 11:15.440]  saying that from Julian Assange to Greenwald to Ron Paul to Rand Paul to
[11:15.440 --> 11:20.720]  Alex Jones to Matt Drudge to anybody that's got a brain but it's not just
[11:20.720 --> 11:25.880]  state-run who's captured our government who has seized control of our
[11:25.880 --> 11:31.480]  government foreign corporate anti-free market interest who do not want us to be
[11:31.480 --> 11:38.960]  able to be individuals they want control over us on record now Greenwald's
[11:38.960 --> 11:43.520]  partner has been detained yesterday at the Heathrow Airport for nine hours
[11:43.520 --> 11:47.800]  everything he had basically downloaded and stolen all because he works with a
[11:47.800 --> 11:53.640]  reporter Greenwald trying to see what WikiLeaks info or Snowden info he had
[11:53.640 --> 11:59.200]  harassing him held under UK terrorism law there's like the UK declared all
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.600]  Icelanders terrorist because two years ago because they wouldn't pay the four
[12:04.600 --> 12:09.720]  plus billion dollars of money that wasn't there their debt to the private
[12:09.720 --> 12:15.880]  British Goldman Sachs JP Morgan banks by the way Chris Jordan came in today and
[12:15.880 --> 12:19.440]  said this was hanging up in his apartment complex and he sees info wars.com
[12:19.440 --> 12:22.960]  stickers everywhere here in Austin in his complex and what does it say if you're
[12:22.960 --> 12:27.440]  not a TV viewer. Iceland's president kicks out FBI agents investigating
[12:27.440 --> 12:32.960]  WikiLeaks we arrest banksters not activists the opposite of what America
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.600]  does yeah that was their president's quote and they arrested the finance
[12:37.600 --> 12:42.760]  minister last year my point is is that we are not the terrorist for pointing
[12:42.760 --> 12:49.120]  out how we have been completely and absolutely overrun on every single
[12:49.120 --> 12:56.840]  level of society by these gangsters we've got more Fukushima news on the
[12:56.840 --> 13:04.240]  ongoing meltdowns there that's getting really big we've got reports up on
[13:04.240 --> 13:10.240]  info wars.com where Glenn Danzig condemns Obama's drone policies says the
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.760]  Democrats are really fascist posing as liberals gee I wonder who he listens to
[13:14.760 --> 13:18.480]  he may not even listen to the show but you can tell he's figured out what's
[13:18.480 --> 13:25.000]  going on I mean boy I'd say they're in trouble when Danzig says they're bad
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.680]  continuing with the news here those that are not preparing for the economic
[13:33.680 --> 13:40.160]  depression are going to bitterly regret it supporting whistleblowers now
[13:40.160 --> 13:46.560]  terrorist activity another article on that Leslie Gelb on Egypt hold your
[13:46.560 --> 13:54.480]  nose and back the junta isn't that interesting we saw Paul Krugman of the
[13:54.480 --> 13:59.880]  New York Times come out and admit that Keynesian economics yesterday is really
[13:59.880 --> 14:06.000]  about centralizing power with the state but says that's a good thing yeah but
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.440]  but with the select corporate interests that are in control of the state in fact
[14:11.440 --> 14:15.440]  here's the article Krugman admits Keynesian economics is about empowering
[14:15.440 --> 14:22.320]  the state in a recent a screed posted on the blog Paul Krugman let the cat out
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.440]  of the bag the essence of Keynesian economics is giving the political class
[14:26.440 --> 14:32.320]  more power he writes the hatred for Keynesian economics has less I think to
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.120]  do with the notion that unemployment isn't a proper subject of policy than
[14:37.120 --> 14:42.520]  about the notion of shifting power over the economic economies destiny away
[14:42.520 --> 14:47.800]  from big business and toward elected officials notice notice he spins that
[14:47.800 --> 14:51.520]  like they're trying to give the power to the people the truth is they're trying
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.280]  to give the power to the economic businessman through the government but
[14:56.280 --> 15:01.400]  not not not the average businessman or woman who's actually out there
[15:01.400 --> 15:06.720]  hiring people but select inside cronies so they'll tell the truth with one hand
[15:06.720 --> 15:13.480]  out of one side of their mouth but then lie with the other side of their mouth so
[15:13.480 --> 15:17.000]  that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down today but I really want
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  to shake the broadcast up and I've been getting closer to doing that in the last
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  few weeks yesterday I took 12 calls on the Sunday show usually take about six
[15:26.000 --> 15:34.720]  so today I want to take 12 calls before this hour ends on any subject you want
[15:34.720 --> 15:38.320]  to call in about but but if it's a diatribe you want to make a point make it
[15:38.320 --> 15:42.640]  about a minute okay or if you have a question for me I'll try to answer it
[15:42.640 --> 15:48.840]  in minutes we get to the next person the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231
[15:48.840 --> 15:56.360]  800-259-9231 and I love all the great ideas callers call in with but about a
[15:56.360 --> 15:59.480]  third of the callers were telling me what I needed to do I should have a
[15:59.480 --> 16:04.640]  national music festival or I should have a national film festival or I should do
[16:04.640 --> 16:08.440]  a show about this or that and a lot of the ideas you you know you send us about
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.440]  guests end up being on the show so email that to show tips and you're welcome
[16:12.440 --> 16:15.400]  to call in and say who you want to be on the show but you want to have on the
[16:15.400 --> 16:21.360]  show but at a certain point folks I'm maxed out okay I was up here at nine
[16:21.360 --> 16:25.440]  o'clock last night and I'm not complaining about that it's just I'm
[16:25.440 --> 16:32.240]  up here seven days a week now okay and I'm trying to be a better manager I'm
[16:32.240 --> 16:35.680]  trying to get things organized I'm trying to redesign and upgrade the sites
[16:35.680 --> 16:39.160]  I'm trying to get the new studios and equipment and solid up links done I'm
[16:39.160 --> 16:43.240]  trying to get the sales in line to make the money to be able to get the word
[16:43.240 --> 16:48.760]  out that's our main mission and so I'm doing the best I can here understand
[16:48.760 --> 16:54.880]  that but I will say on air my my my pet peeve like an ice pick being jabbed in
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.160]  my head is for people to call it and say will you please do this or you please
[16:58.160 --> 17:02.500]  do that I try to have other people on air that are launching new media
[17:02.500 --> 17:06.520]  operations or that are out there doing national campaigns to have people go
[17:06.520 --> 17:10.640]  out and protest on the overpasses and call for Obama's impeachment over his
[17:10.640 --> 17:14.160]  attack on the Second Amendment his funding of Al Qaeda his funding of the
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.800]  Muslim Brotherhood he is shutting down of the power plants man listen we're all
[17:18.800 --> 17:22.520]  in this together I think the message I'm trying to get across to all of you out
[17:22.520 --> 17:31.200]  there and to my crew and everybody else is that is that this is not a spectator
[17:31.200 --> 17:36.080]  sport being free I need all of you to get really aggressive in the fight for
[17:36.080 --> 17:41.560]  liberty I need all of you to decide to go out and go speak at your city council
[17:41.560 --> 17:45.240]  and then videotape it and put it on YouTube on whatever subject whether it's
[17:45.240 --> 17:49.400]  water fluoridation or police state behavior what open borders whatever the
[17:49.400 --> 17:54.160]  case is I need you to go do an access TV show I need you to go do a local radio
[17:54.160 --> 17:58.760]  show I need you to call and talk radio every day other people shows and plug

[18:15.320 --> 18:22.200]  this the film about the CIA and the brainwashing in America that I am
[18:22.200 --> 18:26.440]  distributing that is so well done and so important and then I'm also in state of
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.040]  mind I need you to tell people about the free podcast and the free video streams
[18:31.040 --> 18:37.640]  at info wars calm and prison planet calm I need you to to take action but also

[18:44.800 --> 18:48.240]  into your church and demand the preacher stop being a government minion
[18:48.240 --> 18:54.760]  I heard a local talk show this morning that has some good host on it Mark
[18:54.760 --> 18:58.240]  Caesar and Sergeant Sam on it and there's the other talk show host it kind of
[18:58.240 --> 19:01.520]  plays a part of the liberal on the show and they were saying you know we should
[19:01.520 --> 19:05.840]  allow churches to be politically involved that's the first amendment and the
[19:05.840 --> 19:10.640]  other host was saying the other two no it's not and I called in and those just
[19:10.640 --> 19:13.560]  said that's just not true I said the first amendment on there I said
[19:13.560 --> 19:17.240]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit
[19:17.240 --> 19:21.240]  the free exercise thereof and then when I was gone the guy that plays the part of
[19:21.240 --> 19:24.600]  the liberal I think I don't think he really is a liberal as they call them
[19:24.600 --> 19:30.360]  release authoritarianism he says well Alex is just wrong that that isn't true
[19:30.360 --> 19:34.160]  what he said all it was quote the first amendment because we've been living
[19:34.160 --> 19:38.080]  under the government running churches for 60 years in this country people just
[19:38.080 --> 19:41.440]  accept now that it's the custom it's okay and they were bringing it up because
[19:41.440 --> 19:45.000]  there's a movement with churches nationwide that was small just a few
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.560]  years ago and is now more than 20,000 to be political and I'm gonna talk about
[19:50.560 --> 19:53.320]  that and then go to your phone calls when we come back but that's another

[24:25.080 --> 24:29.480]  in my stack that I'm gonna get to later in the next hour after dr. Blalock
[24:29.480 --> 24:36.360]  leaves us where oh my goodness there's a nationwide movement of now 20,000
[24:36.360 --> 24:41.160]  churches it was like 8,000 last time I checked a few months ago and I remember
[24:41.160 --> 24:48.880]  that movement starting on the GCN radio network about the I don't know more than
[24:48.880 --> 24:51.960]  a decade ago with some of the preachers here on air I'm not bragging about our
[24:51.960 --> 24:56.560]  network I remember though different pastors that we had on his guest
[24:56.560 --> 25:00.440]  different pastors that have radio shows pastor Greg Dixon and others in the
[25:00.440 --> 25:05.600]  Indianapolis Baptist temple I guess that was about 12 years ago calling for
[25:05.600 --> 25:09.200]  this nationwide movement but just the last few years it's really picked up
[25:09.200 --> 25:12.880]  steam to go you know churches are under the first amendment Congress shall make
[25:12.880 --> 25:17.400]  no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
[25:17.400 --> 25:21.680]  exercise thereof churches are outside the jurisdiction of the federal
[25:21.680 --> 25:25.480]  government and state government separation of church and state means you
[25:25.480 --> 25:30.520]  can't have a state-run religion can't be Baptist can't be Catholic can't be
[25:30.520 --> 25:38.840]  Zoroaster can't be Muslim can't be you know Islamic law can't be whatever sect
[25:38.840 --> 25:44.920]  of Christian law you want to make it that's what separation of church and
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.680]  state means but since the 50s phasing into the 60s they slowly had the
[25:49.680 --> 25:56.840]  denominations sit there and tell their sub-churches you are not allowed now to
[25:56.840 --> 25:59.880]  endorse a candidate you're not allowed to have a candidate come and speak of the
[25:59.880 --> 26:03.800]  church then I've had friends that go to major Baptist churches in Austin and
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.560]  Catholic churches because I've showed the letters on air where they say you're
[26:07.560 --> 26:13.680]  not allowed to even as a parishioner as a member as a member of the flock to
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.960]  speak about your views on on politics don't do it at a church barbecue don't
[26:18.960 --> 26:23.080]  do it a church volleyball game don't do it at a church retreat you keep that to
[26:23.080 --> 26:28.680]  yourself what authoritarianism and finally we had a wake-up call a few
[26:28.680 --> 26:32.760]  months ago when the audio tapes got released and we played them here of the
[26:32.760 --> 26:38.440]  IRS telling pro-life groups you're not allowed to pray and you're not allowed
[26:38.440 --> 26:44.800]  of your tax exempt to go out and protest for babies and then telling them tell
[26:44.800 --> 26:49.240]  us what you pray and churches have audits where they're told show us your
[26:49.240 --> 26:54.040]  prayers ladies and gentlemen that's the Soviet Union that's Nazi Germany the
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.520]  Soviet Union had churches Nazi Germany had churches malice China had churches
[26:58.520 --> 27:04.680]  China today has churches but you better toe the Communist Party line and that's
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.920]  what we've got here and I hear two talk show hosts this morning is why I've
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.720]  gone off in this jag before I go to your calls and all the news explaining hey
[27:13.720 --> 27:17.680]  it's the First Amendment and the other one go and know it isn't its fascism to
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.960]  have churches involved in religion and really believing that you know the story
[27:22.960 --> 27:26.720]  of Patrick Henry of the give me liberty or give me death that guy if you pull
[27:26.720 --> 27:29.840]  this because I forget the preacher's name there was a preacher a week before
[27:29.840 --> 27:35.800]  who was beaten to death by British soldiers with a horse whip he was
[27:35.800 --> 27:43.760]  beaten to death by a by a horse whip beaten and that's hard to do beaten to
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.760]  death over an hour with a horse whip till he till he wanted to shock and bled
[27:46.760 --> 27:53.480]  to death because he would not preach the official pro-government issued sermon
[27:53.480 --> 27:57.800]  and so they came and watched the sermon they took him out and they beat him to
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.360]  death and then Patrick Henry came out and said they're already killing us
[28:02.360 --> 28:05.720]  they're already attacking us the war has already begun I don't know what course
[28:05.720 --> 28:08.480]  you're gonna take if you want to crash down and lick the hand it feeds you may
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.280]  your chains set lightly upon you forget that you are our brethren but as for me
[28:13.280 --> 28:18.160]  I want to know the whole truth nothing but the truth and make preparation for
[28:18.160 --> 28:22.760]  it and as for me give me liberty or give me death you there are a lot of things
[28:22.760 --> 28:30.640]  that the war started over in 1775 and officially 1776 July 4th taxes
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.800]  regulations people being pressed to serve as slaves white slaves on ships
[28:35.800 --> 28:40.960]  under the press gangs the naval ships they came for the firearms that was when
[28:40.960 --> 28:45.280]  it finally was the spark and the shot heard around the world but what really
[28:45.280 --> 28:49.120]  got everybody in gear was the preachers being told what to do and to have state
[28:49.120 --> 28:53.080]  run religion and that's why it didn't matter whether it was a Catholic colony
[28:53.080 --> 28:59.560]  or a Protestant colony a Quaker colony a Puritan colony it didn't matter what it
[28:59.560 --> 29:04.360]  was they all got together and they said it's time to get the guns and it's time
[29:04.360 --> 29:10.000]  for a war you want a war you got one you're not coming in to our churches and
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.720]  telling us what to do they were called the black brigades the black regiments
[29:15.720 --> 29:19.920]  because back then all the preachers not just the Catholics wore black with a
[29:19.920 --> 29:24.880]  white thing around their neck that was a uniform and they said we are not gonna
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.040]  be the slaves of King George the third no king but King Jesus and America came
[29:30.040 --> 29:34.560]  together and kicked an empire that was undefeated out of this country an
[29:34.560 --> 29:38.520]  empire a few years later that beat Napoleon Bonaparte we kicked their butt
[29:38.520 --> 29:44.520]  right back to England you understand that you understand that and the British
[29:44.520 --> 29:50.200]  over there finally got their government back as well stay with us we're on the

[35:45.400 --> 35:48.800]  this look at the side-by-side comparisons of pro pure systems and the
[35:48.800 --> 35:52.440]  pro one filters that cut out the fluoride everything inside by side
[35:52.440 --> 35:57.320]  comparisons to the leading competitors hands down annihilates them all that's

[36:16.680 --> 36:19.600]  glyphosate in it I want people to see that headline I think it was washed in
[36:19.600 --> 36:23.760]  post last year the point is is that it doesn't matter if it's rainwater
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.480]  collection it doesn't matter if some of it's on your roof from birds or whatever
[36:28.480 --> 36:34.240]  running in or if it's in the well water or the tap water you've got to filter

[37:15.800 --> 37:22.440]  21. Hey Alex thank you for taking my call I love your operation big shout out
[37:22.440 --> 37:28.640]  to your wonderful crew and all the info warriors out there on Prison Planet not
[37:28.640 --> 37:33.400]  Prison Planet Planet info wars.com I love all of you brothers and sisters in
[37:33.400 --> 37:40.520]  the info war. I wanted to just bring forth an idea that I had it's a simple
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.400]  idea and I wanted to bounce it off of you and see if it's maybe something that
[37:45.400 --> 37:52.440]  you would consider beneficial it's based on the Googlebomb technology a couple
[37:52.440 --> 37:58.480]  years ago you had a great caller who had a Googlebomb idea where you would
[37:58.480 --> 38:04.160]  mention search terms on your show every day and we Google and created trend and
[38:04.160 --> 38:10.920]  and really made an impact on on the web and then Google started censoring
[38:10.920 --> 38:16.400]  info wars.com and it kind of lost its effect but this idea is kind of based
[38:16.400 --> 38:25.920]  on that technology basically what it is is just a it's just a link that that we
[38:25.920 --> 38:31.720]  can all focus on every day so Planet Info Wars it will will click on this link
[38:31.720 --> 38:37.920]  or links that you deem important beneficial so we can go and leave
[38:37.920 --> 38:45.920]  comments and really create like a social media phenomenon that no no sir that's
[38:45.920 --> 38:51.520]  absolute genius and we should have a time of day where we do it and we focus
[38:51.520 --> 38:57.360]  on Twitter Facebook and other systems with a story from info wars.com now
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.440]  now let me explain what happened with the Googlebombs we probably did a hundred
[39:01.440 --> 39:06.000]  of those or so in a two-year period and we could do it every I should have done
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.160]  it more often but I do want to burn the audience out but but we would we would
[39:11.160 --> 39:14.760]  put out a term that was connected to some news story we put out that was
[39:14.760 --> 39:18.640]  really important and we could get the number one search term almost every time
[39:18.640 --> 39:22.720]  and then get hundreds of news articles out of it and so it was artificially
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.360]  doing what only drudge report.com is still able to do just because of the I
[39:28.360 --> 39:32.200]  don't know was it 40 50 million a day or something to visit it just some off the
[39:32.200 --> 39:37.080]  chart ridiculous number visit drudge report.com we were able to do that but
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.800]  they went and changed the algorithm and announced they changed the algorithm on a
[39:41.800 --> 39:49.480]  bunch of different topics and suddenly we couldn't do it anymore and now they're
[39:49.480 --> 39:53.760]  gaming that but but here's an example it's not doing it today but it's been
[39:53.760 --> 39:57.600]  doing it every day the last two months so it's strange you I would type in
[39:57.600 --> 40:00.400]  Alex Jones to check what was in Google news every day if you punch up my
[40:00.400 --> 40:05.960]  computer guys and the top link would be the January 9th show that I was on
[40:05.960 --> 40:12.800]  Pierce Morgan. Seeing in somehow was gaming it to where they could always on
[40:12.800 --> 40:17.240]  Google news have their old story back up there first and I've seen a few times
[40:17.240 --> 40:22.000]  last two months it wasn't today must be one of those one of those days but we
[40:22.000 --> 40:27.040]  went look at their code they're resubmitting the article every day like
[40:27.040 --> 40:31.360]  it's new and I've been told if you do that Google can delist you that's fraud
[40:31.360 --> 40:36.520]  we don't do that we're still delisted from Google news info wars.com
[40:36.520 --> 40:43.200]  prisonplanet.com articles cannot show up now on Google news which is very
[40:43.200 --> 40:47.040]  important you know Google went down for five minutes this weekend and 40% of
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.920]  web traffic died they are the internet they are the NSA they're trying to take
[40:50.920 --> 40:55.080]  it over so the good news is people doppelganger articles to all of their
[40:55.080 --> 41:00.120]  news sites and so it still gets out on Google news so it's a great idea we
[41:00.120 --> 41:05.640]  should do it every day in fact let's let's beta test it let's beta test it
[41:05.640 --> 41:13.840]  right now and go to infowars.com I got so many computers up in here I can't
[41:13.840 --> 41:17.080]  even hardly do it on this computer and let's pick an article thank you caller
[41:17.080 --> 41:21.880]  I appreciate your call let's go with this and I wrote this with Watson this
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.240]  morning I called up and left a transcript and he put it into article
[41:25.240 --> 41:30.400]  form and Watson didn't exactly put in there what I wanted in there he must
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.720]  have not come across it but the point is they're using troops that are on
[41:33.720 --> 41:38.200]  pharmaceuticals as an excuse to take their rights and they prime the pump by
[41:38.200 --> 41:46.600]  putting US military ordering them on record to take growth hormone anabolic
[41:46.600 --> 41:55.840]  steroids to take basically hillbilly heroin drugs like Percocet drugs like
[41:55.840 --> 42:01.520]  oxy cotton before it got taken off the market so that they then can control
[42:01.520 --> 42:04.640]  them later and when they get out of the military we'll put you back on this
[42:04.640 --> 42:09.200]  even though you're not shot or in pain they order them and I'd already seen
[42:09.200 --> 42:12.880]  this on the back of the newspaper a few times and in Pentagon reports but to have
[42:12.880 --> 42:17.520]  Staff Sergeant Biggs tell us about it really hit home and so we have an
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.800]  article dealing with that a mass-drugging of US troops an unreported
[42:21.800 --> 42:27.680]  scandal it's the forced mass-drugging show said to me Colin Watson we run in
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.640]  there and have a Don or somebody or Kurt or Julie or Kit just add the word
[42:31.640 --> 42:37.120]  forced mass-drugging it's forced because because I know the public works they'll
[42:37.120 --> 42:41.040]  think oh that's somebody having trouble they ordered them on Blue Box or
[42:41.040 --> 42:44.880]  something no no no no no yeah 20% of them are on that according to the
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.520]  Justice Department so let's Pentagon's numbers on that and we have those
[42:50.520 --> 42:53.840]  statistics in the article the 20% are on psychotropics I'm not talking about
[42:53.840 --> 42:57.640]  that I mean ordering them on speed order and I don't mean because they got to
[42:57.640 --> 43:01.160]  stay up for two days in an emergency that's that that's one thing if you're
[43:01.160 --> 43:05.240]  pinned down in foxholes for three days and yeah you got you know speed in your
[43:05.240 --> 43:07.800]  pocket there is a time for that no no this is
[43:07.800 --> 43:13.800]  drugging ordering them you will take Percocet and you will take the speed to
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.600]  come off of it you will take Percocet just to get them addicted this is a big
[43:17.600 --> 43:25.880]  scandal and the officer class is exempt from it so let's make that the big
[43:25.880 --> 43:31.880]  number one story of the day let's make that mass-drugging of US troops an
[43:31.880 --> 43:36.920]  unreported scandal let's take that and put it out on Twitter I'm going to
[43:36.920 --> 43:41.680]  retweeted it real Alex Jones let's put it out on our Facebook let's send it to
[43:41.680 --> 43:44.720]  your email I'll send it out to everybody signed up for the free newsletter
[43:44.720 --> 43:49.800]  info wars.com forward slash newsletter sign up to get the free digital

[43:53.760 --> 43:57.920]  mass email today this article and then you send it forward to everybody you
[43:57.920 --> 44:02.480]  know let's do this together and let's test the Google algorithm I've done a
[44:02.480 --> 44:05.680]  Google bomb in about two years since they shot us out let's take that and
[44:05.680 --> 44:13.160]  let's make the Google bomb, drugging troops two words drugging troops you go
[44:13.160 --> 44:18.040]  to Google and you put in drugging troops and you enter it over and over and over
[44:18.040 --> 44:22.960]  again you re-enter it put the cursor make it a new search enter enter enter enter
[44:22.960 --> 44:27.880]  you go up you type it in you hit enter then you put the cursor back in it so
[44:27.880 --> 44:33.080]  it's a new search hit it again email it out tweet it let's do it let's do it
[44:33.080 --> 44:37.520]  together let's see what the people can do let's fight back absolutely great
[44:37.520 --> 44:41.800]  job callers yeah I said I take 12 calls this hour I've taken one all right let's
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.120]  go to John in Texas you're on the year welcome thanks for holding hi Alex good
[44:47.120 --> 44:52.200]  good to talk to you go ahead why do you think that our political leadership is
[44:52.200 --> 44:55.600]  ignoring Fukushima something that could be one of the worst disasters to hit this
[44:55.600 --> 44:58.600]  planet yet you don't hear nothing about it and they're not warning anybody or
[44:58.600 --> 45:07.440]  anything say that again sir why is our political leadership not telling
[45:07.440 --> 45:11.360]  anybody about Fukushima something it could be one of the worst disasters to
[45:11.360 --> 45:15.680]  hit this planet yet there's no warnings or nothing about it and by the way it
[45:15.680 --> 45:18.760]  wasn't that you weren't clear they were popping in my air which which they they're
[45:18.760 --> 45:24.200]  told to do and so I was missing some of what you said there because I was
[45:24.200 --> 45:28.040]  noticing that when we put that search in drugging troops that it is the top
[45:28.040 --> 45:33.360]  internet YouTube search under that term that's what a just God's send and
[45:33.360 --> 45:38.440]  treasure info wars.com is that we're able to so many cases dominate even the
[45:38.440 --> 45:46.000]  NSA search results and I feel like I'm falling down every day not doing a
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.480]  better job with the incredible platform we've got in fact I'm gonna put you on
[45:49.480 --> 45:54.600]  hold and say something right now I came in this morning and I begged my crew on
[45:54.600 --> 45:58.280]  the TV side and a few other people I said we've got to go to the next level in
[45:58.280 --> 46:01.640]  this fight this is all gonna come true we're gonna get shut down the new
[46:01.640 --> 46:05.000]  orders gonna come in they're gearing up the martial law they're gonna stage the
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.960]  false flag what can we do to really use the platform we've got to break through
[46:09.960 --> 46:17.120]  to the next level that's the big goal and you know a caller like this calls in
[46:17.120 --> 46:20.920]  John in Texas and it hits me like a ton of bricks that I have not articulated
[46:20.920 --> 46:26.480]  properly how big this is because I've psychoanalyzed historically comparing
[46:26.480 --> 46:32.960]  them to other elites other ruling classes the establishment and what he
[46:32.960 --> 46:39.000]  just asked is the big trillion dollar question we had corrupt ruthless
[46:39.000 --> 46:46.960]  authoritarian elites before 1990 but they would never let US military use DU
[46:46.960 --> 46:52.920]  Israel had DU and wouldn't use it until recently that by the way kills their
[46:52.920 --> 46:59.920]  troops long-term not just who they're shooting so it's only Israel the US and
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.760]  England that are now using it that's crazy every time you fire it it ignites in
[47:04.760 --> 47:10.640]  the barrel and you get a debilitating dose a soft kill dose just in what comes
[47:10.640 --> 47:19.800]  out of the front of the barrel and that you breathe and if you look at things
[47:19.800 --> 47:24.080]  like Fukushima conservatively and dr. Busby's on nuclear physicist on Friday
[47:24.080 --> 47:27.200]  conservatively according to him and others about a hundred times worse than
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.640]  Chernobyl in 1986 and you realize that the UN so numbers say it's killed around a
[47:31.640 --> 47:39.400]  million people in the last few decades since Chernobyl I guess 17 years when
[47:39.400 --> 47:45.080]  you realize how long it's been since 1986 I can't even do math anymore I guess
[47:45.080 --> 47:50.280]  it's 20 something years how long is that yeah 20 something years my brain's gone
[47:50.280 --> 47:59.040]  folks I'm doing too much and the point is is that now 91% according to the
[47:59.040 --> 48:03.760]  International Atomic Energy Agency of reactors are leaking so they had to
[48:03.760 --> 48:07.560]  change the standards last year and say that's okay now they've taken the
[48:07.560 --> 48:12.080]  alarms off the reactors all over North America Canada you name it so that
[48:12.080 --> 48:17.960]  doesn't scare the public when the alarms go off loudspeakers you know in
[48:17.960 --> 48:21.320]  Southern California last year they kept having alarms they said we're just gonna
[48:21.320 --> 48:26.520]  turn the alarms off now and the elite live in those areas it's like they don't
[48:26.520 --> 48:31.600]  care anymore either they put out propaganda and use normal human laziness
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.080]  to kind of politically neutralize the general public so we would submit to
[48:36.080 --> 48:43.120]  them but there's blowback from their own propaganda the mindset the the spirit
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.920]  of the of the world what is that that's really kind of the sixth sense broadcast
[48:47.920 --> 48:51.760]  that they've scientifically proven is in all all plants and animals not just
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.440]  humans that you know you go into a room you feel the electric energy you're
[48:55.440 --> 48:59.320]  going to room you feel the depression it's like a broadcast you can call it
[48:59.320 --> 49:02.960]  spiritual whatever you want it's been it's been over and over again thousands
[49:02.960 --> 49:08.400]  of times scientifically quantified the walking room you can tell if somebody's
[49:08.400 --> 49:11.480]  not even talking they're putting off bad vibes or you can tell when somebody's
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.680]  looking at you in a restaurant you turn around they're looking at you there's
[49:15.680 --> 49:19.760]  the spirit in the elite of not caring and just wanting to die themselves and
[49:19.760 --> 49:24.480]  they've kind of passed it on to us to where Fukushima happens and all those
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.600]  other stuff happens now and open-air GMO crops you name it and they just don't
[49:28.600 --> 49:33.600]  care anymore and they think somehow they're going to get around it or get
[49:33.600 --> 49:37.560]  by it and they're not and so you ask why they don't care and why they cover it
[49:37.560 --> 49:43.680]  up they're not even trying to fix it so it doesn't happen more they just don't
[49:43.680 --> 49:48.280]  care anymore they they're like knee-robe fiddling while Rome burned finally he was
[49:48.280 --> 49:52.400]  so decadent he said I'm so decadent I'll just commit suicide because I can
[49:52.400 --> 49:57.840]  does that answer your question John in Texas well what I think is you know they
[49:57.840 --> 50:01.920]  got all these underground cities and I think they figured it well while I was
[50:01.920 --> 50:04.920]  supposed to die from radiation they could run their underground cities and
[50:04.920 --> 50:09.240]  basically become the more locks that HUL's rolled up in the future you know
[50:09.240 --> 50:12.480]  and I don't know if that's what the deal isn't out but they're building these
[50:12.480 --> 50:15.640]  underground cities I think they figured they're going to just run in there and
[50:15.640 --> 50:18.880]  hide while the rest of us die from the radiation poisoning you know well that is
[50:18.880 --> 50:21.400]  true the United States has spent more than all governments combined on
[50:21.400 --> 50:27.160]  underground bases on record the details are classified more on COG and now
[50:27.160 --> 50:32.760]  Homeland Security is the coming out of COG the the the absorption like in the
[50:32.760 --> 50:37.840]  movie the thing of the old Republic and it's gonna absorb everything nothing's
[50:37.840 --> 50:42.120]  gonna be allowed to live less standing it is it is satanic it is a diabolical
[50:42.120 --> 50:49.080]  total takeover plan thank you John okay Cole and Chad and Julio and Ben your

[54:44.400 --> 54:51.640]  happening and it hits me how real all this is this is not a game the things
[54:51.640 --> 54:55.160]  we talk about here if you're a new listener are really happening our
[54:55.160 --> 54:58.720]  government really runs al-qaeda worldwide our government really backs the
[54:58.720 --> 55:03.800]  muslim brotherhood to burn up and blow up 60 plus churches in the last week our
[55:03.800 --> 55:08.360]  government really supports every wicked evil thing you can imagine to
[55:08.360 --> 55:11.920]  destabilize the world because they make money off of it coming and going our
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.800]  government is illegitimate our government is a fraud openly abolishing the
[55:16.800 --> 55:21.040]  bill of rights and constitution and all the protections that go along with it
[55:21.040 --> 55:27.240]  right now that's what every analyst across the board points out is that it's
[55:27.240 --> 55:32.680]  all happening right now this is big this is real this is serious this is
[55:32.680 --> 55:36.280]  pertinent this is going to affect everyone and all the yuppies and
[55:36.280 --> 55:39.160]  trendies that that think it protects them that they act like they don't care
[55:39.160 --> 55:44.680]  about anything you are living in the last days of our free republic and the
[55:44.680 --> 55:52.680]  last shadow you under the wings of the republic but it's now already fading
[55:52.680 --> 55:57.240]  away and all the prosperity is going out the door with it we are becoming like
[55:57.240 --> 56:03.360]  everybody else slaves run by the corrupt el-hefes the corrupt new world
[56:03.360 --> 56:10.400]  order king rats and now is the time to decide what you're going to do about it
[56:10.400 --> 56:14.400]  and it doesn't mean you got to save the world by yourself it means you've got to
[56:14.400 --> 56:18.360]  do a little something say no to things stand up to being treated like a slave
[56:18.360 --> 56:22.680]  learn your rights learn your freedoms and become aggressive in the
[56:22.680 --> 56:28.160]  prosecution of liberty against tyranny a free people will not be slaves you have
[56:28.160 --> 56:32.200]  to decide you're free and then act like you're free if you act like you're a
[56:32.200 --> 56:38.040]  slave you'll be a slave it's very simple let's go to coal in Georgia you're on
[56:38.040 --> 56:50.680]  the old air sir go ahead hey brother I want to know how everything is going on
[56:50.680 --> 57:00.640]  and Egypt's not the military given aid to the people in Egypt I'm just kind of
[57:00.640 --> 57:04.560]  curious about what's going on well our military it's not our military our
[57:04.560 --> 57:10.760]  captured military has been giving aid to we go back three and a half on really
[57:10.760 --> 57:16.560]  four years ago Google on record created the air of spring the the the West
[57:16.560 --> 57:24.640]  ordered the military to run a coup basically against the dictator of
[57:24.640 --> 57:31.600]  Egypt Hossie Mubarak to then have the whole fake election have Google test
[57:31.600 --> 57:36.880]  social networking to put Morris in there's basically an al-Qaeda type person
[57:36.880 --> 57:41.680]  and then they've had just over a year and a half just murdering Christians
[57:41.680 --> 57:46.840]  crucifying Christians and others in the presidential palace grounds I mean just
[57:46.840 --> 57:50.320]  it's been hell on earth because everywhere the globalists go they they
[57:50.320 --> 57:54.880]  want to kill Christians just to give you an idea who they really are Baptist
[57:54.880 --> 58:01.000]  Coptic Catholic they don't care you're dead you're dead and our government did
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.120]  that and so they've been giving them propaganda advice and and have been
[58:05.120 --> 58:11.480]  giving money to those groups and now you notice her media for the last couple
[58:11.480 --> 58:15.320]  weeks keeps calling them protesters as they machine gun people burn people
[58:15.320 --> 58:19.120]  throw people off roofs and the military shoots them to stop them and then
[58:19.120 --> 58:23.520]  they're called oh my gosh on CNN the military is killing people CNN loved
[58:23.520 --> 58:27.720]  them killing people at Waco CNN loves it when the police beat your head in here
[58:27.720 --> 58:32.520]  and I'm not saying that the Egyptian military is perfect the truth is they've
[58:32.520 --> 58:36.640]  broken with the globalist because they're trying to bring their country

[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.560]  Obamacare news big news on coca-cola putting out these ads saying aspartame's
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.280]  not bad for you that's all coming up but we're taking calls right now and then
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.240]  more calls later in the hour cold was asking about how was our government
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.240]  funding the muslim brotherhood well on record they've been backing them with
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.400]  billions of dollars of extra money and saying that if the the military
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.360]  government is what else is there in the government you know they kick out the
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.440]  old government put the muslim brotherhood in and then 30 million people
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.400]  go out and protest which is you know 10 times the muslim brotherhood could put
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.400]  on the streets they could put a couple you know two three million now and then
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.040]  basically the secularist the Christians the muslims that aren't extremist the
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.520]  Shiite muslims others they go out 30 million the military didn't have a
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.280]  choice so they said okay we've got to remove moracy who was engaged in all
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:27.560]  sorts of war crimes that our media wouldn't cover the whole Middle East is
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.520]  being given to radical muslims right now from Libya to Syria to Iraq to you name
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:38.080]  it our government's funding four different al-qaeda groups on record to
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.880]  blow stuff up inside Iran and Iran is publicly suing the US about it but
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.840]  again the average American cannot even find Iran on the map folks I mean they've
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.400]  done national studies where 80 plus percent can't I just saw one a few
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.120]  months ago and you see those things on TV where people don't know even what
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.280]  planet they're on and so it's like al-qaeda is the skeleton key and radical
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.320]  Wahhabism and radical Islam is a real threat but the globalist the big banks
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:11.040]  are funding it to take over countries but then also take over here building a
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:16.600]  system up to oppose it it's basic funding both sides at the Rothschilds were so
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:21.760]  good at 200 plus years ago in Europe that system the British Empire adopted is
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.400]  the system of the globalist they want trouble they want crises they want
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.640]  monopolies they want wars they want al-qaeda with 10,000 heat-seeking missiles
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.160]  given to them by the Pentagon in Libya so they can shut down all of society in
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.040]  the name of stopping them once they stop start blowing up aircraft by the way
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.240]  I've been telling you that for two years it was in the news last week we
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.640]  covered it with mainstream media going al-qaeda is predicted to start shooting
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.640]  down European and US and Canadian airliners and they admitted in the
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.240]  articles the BBC also had one oh yeah they got them in Libya the US and NATO
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:06.400]  let them get them they didn't let them give them they gave them to them because
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.600]  they're gonna blow stuff up and then we're gonna lose our rights I mean can
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.600]  you figure that out until we say no more holding us hostage you know the
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.600]  globalist hold us hostage and go give up your rights or al-qaeda will kill you
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:20.440]  okay then you let al-qaeda blow up airplanes and we're gonna arrest
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.480]  everybody in the Pentagon and the Obama administration who was involved in this
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.960]  and no amount of pardons are gonna protect you and that's why we're putting
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.840]  the narrative out now so when it happens everybody knows who to blame stop
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:40.880]  holding us hostage I want to live in a free country I don't want to sit here and
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.160]  be held hostage by military industrial complex it's anti-American and anti-

[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:55.200]  news and really focus in on the creeping up of interest rates worldwide that he
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:00.640]  predicted the bond market in trouble that he successfully predicted he's going
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:05.720]  to be joining us for about 30 minutes of the next 45 minutes or so then I'll go
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.640]  back to the callers that are holding on news issues we're joined by dr. Russell
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:16.080]  Blalock retired medical doctor he is a best-selling author board certified
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.160]  neurosurgeon that's brain surgeon he's a former clinical professor of neurology
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.720]  the University of Mississippi Medical Center and I'm not going to go over his
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.120]  whole bio but he's extremely famous and it came up decades ago with the terms
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.600]  like excitotoxins and things like that that are now mainline accepted in the
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.200]  medical literature and of course he also developed many of the now most
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.280]  commonly used forms of brain surgery I'm not going to get into all that but he's
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:50.320]  a brain surgeon's brain surgeon and he's got a bunch of great websites I will
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.200]  give you some of those coming up today so you can visit his sites and learn more
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.240]  about what he's doing and the good news is he travels the world speaking to in
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.880]  some cases thousands of physicians I know because we went and interviewed him in
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.000]  Las Vegas when he was speaking to look like a thousand top physicians laying
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.080]  all the info you're about to hear out to them so I'm not sitting here you know
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.600]  just blowing smoke at the audience I want you to know how effective he's been
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.560]  because we need to understand that that that we're on the march and this
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:32.000]  tyranny is on the run and that there are a lot of good people lawyers doctors
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.720]  scientists military men and women prominent leaders that are telling the
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.320]  truth and that's why we're seeing the alternative media explode while the
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.960]  mainstream media dies you know four years ago Dr. Blalock came on and said
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:52.520]  this wine flu H1N1 is a hoax it's very dangerous and it's going to increase
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:57.280]  the instances of the flu and he gave a bunch of examples a year later they
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:00.800]  came out in the official Canadian government journals and admitted it
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.920]  doubled your chances of getting regular flu gave people Guillain berets epilepsy
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:11.160]  everything he said because he's for decades witnessed it but he first got
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:16.520]  demonized all over the media for it but so what that's a badge of honor he laid
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.960]  out for us four years ago what Obamacare would do now it's being implemented
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.760]  you're seeing that all happen so the reason I like to introduce some of our
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.920]  long-term guests only come on a few times a year like this is to understand the
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.840]  truth is out there and the system knows the truth this year they're running ads
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.440]  schools about to start that it's the law you've got to take vaccines there is no
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:43.240]  law you've got to take vaccines they also lie in the news and say there's no
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.640]  side effects read the insert folks go to the CDC read the vaccine you're taking
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:52.960]  and see the in some cases hundreds of pages per shot of what they are it's a
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:57.720]  choice of do you listen to people that are truthful and give you sources or do
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:03.160]  you listen to liars and that's why Dr. Blalock joins us now I first wanted to
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:09.680]  get him on last week about Coca-Cola running print ads and internet ads but
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:17.120]  also TV ads are coming defending aspartame that Dr. Blalock has been
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.560]  extremely extremely prominent and exposing they're also saying it doesn't
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.720]  make you gain weight even though big studies came out in was it Harvard
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:32.560]  Medical General this year saying it's linked to obesity so he's the trail
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.520]  blazer the first really prominent person 20 plus years ago to expose all this so
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.000]  I thought I would just we don't do this with most gas give you all the things
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.800]  they've done I've only told you a fraction of it and we're gonna get to
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.840]  that with him but I wanted to first throw a curveball at him and say Dr.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:56.160]  Blalock you laid out as a physician what Obamacare would do by reading it now
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:03.080]  we're seeing the train wreck a what is Obamacare really designed to do be how
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.200]  do you think his implementation is going and what can we do to reverse this
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:12.720]  thank you for joining us thank you Alex well the Obamacare thing when I was
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:18.400]  interviewed by you what I told you is that the interesting thing about the
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:25.760]  bill all 2000 pages it's a gigantic blank check what it actually says in
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.200]  writing that you can come back and hold their feet to the fire like you do the
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.920]  Constitution or other laws there's nothing specific in it what it does it
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.880]  says these decisions will be made later by the Secretary of Health and Human
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.280]  Services that's all through the document well who would enact a bill
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:50.760]  that's a blank check that says all these things the design the effects the
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:57.720]  punishment the cost it's all going to be determined later well you know only a
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:04.560]  fool would do such a thing and of course Congress acts like a gigantic fool so
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:10.680]  they design this thing so that you can manipulate it continuously once it's
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.960]  enacted now you hear a lot there's a lot of books published on what Obamacare
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.280]  means what you need to know most of these things really don't get into the need of
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:28.440]  this bill this bill is going to change the face of America drastically and what
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:34.360]  I mean by that and the position starting to be aware of this is in this if you if
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:39.960]  you go by the people who designed this thing their ultimate plan is to number
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:48.800]  one make most people to be seen by physicians, assistants, nurse practitioners
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:56.200]  and not physicians they've been wanting to do this for 50 years they write about
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.600]  it extensively and their model has been Cuba and other communist countries
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.160]  where this is done extensively that is you you're taken care of by someone
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:12.520]  that's not a trained physician number two is that the physicians themselves are
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:17.280]  going to be encouraged to become general physicians not specialists what they
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.640]  know is that the cost of specialty care is enormously expensive compared to
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:29.040]  general care when you look at the analysis of every socialist health
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:34.440]  care system in the world Brenton being a good example in Canada what they
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.120]  quickly discovered was two things about specialty care number one is the
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.760]  enormous expense the number two is that they're very independent doctors they
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:47.760]  don't like to be told what to do and even they had to compromise and let the
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.960]  independent doctors collect private fees the only way they could keep them
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.560]  working so they've learned that lesson now and so what they've done in this
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.760]  bill is designed it so the punishments to the physician include imprisonment
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:11.640]  loss of license public billification there's a number of things that's going
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.360]  to be done for instance it clearly says that if you treat a patient in a
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.920]  hospital and that patient goes home and it ends up having to come back to the
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.360]  merge room within a certain length of time the doctor and the hospital are
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.800]  supposed to be punished well let me stop you right there my dad who's very
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.840]  successful as an oral surgeon and dentist in medical management he has
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.640]  made the decision to phase out in the next year and not do it anymore because
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.120]  they all get called in by the state boards he goes down to the Capitol and
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.840]  is even in the meetings and the feds are there and say you work with us you can
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.240]  make money do whatever you want if not we're gonna set you up and send you to
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:56.760]  prison and if you dot an I wrong you're gonna go to jail and my dad's just like
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:00.440]  you know what I'm out of here and he says almost everybody he knows is
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.600]  leaving and he knows Dr. Blalock as you said that the plan is to make everybody
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.560]  quit so they can just fully take it over well and you see this is this is the
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.400]  alternative what they want to do is replace American positions with foreign
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.920]  positions for instance the Cubans government had offered during Hurricane
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.440]  Katrina and several times to the state of Mississippi to send in Cuban
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.760]  physicians to help treat the poor you know they always have to use the hook and
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:34.480]  the state of Mississippi refused but they keep trying well this is part of
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:40.480]  the plan and the model used by these think tanks is to use foreign
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:46.280]  physicians from Pakistan for instance that's what the VA does right and so
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:52.920]  they bring more and more of these people in so eventually the native American
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:57.680]  physician is no longer going to be around and of course you know the ones
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.200]  who persist in this day around they're gonna risk imprisonment and which has
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:05.120]  already happened you know most the public's not aware how many physicians
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:11.600]  have been railroad and sent to prison over eras and trying to interpret this
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:17.360]  uninterpretable coding nonsense they have to do you know no one knows the
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.880]  codes they even went to the people who designed the code that they well they
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.800]  don't know what it means so here's a poor physician trying to figure out how
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.440]  to code his patient for the medical reimbursement yes and no idea how to do
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:34.680]  some of them and they tell him we'll just pick something and so he tried to get
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.720]  as close as he can then they come back years later even ten years later say
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.800]  will you miscode this patient that is abuse of a federal patient you're
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.600]  going to prison absolutely and my father says exactly what you've been
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.480]  saying on the show four or five years ago exposing this and he says it's
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.480]  written to where there's no way to follow their rules and that's why he says
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:19:01.040]  so many mid-sized companies that were actually providing great care across the
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:04.360]  board medical dental you name it they're just they're just leaving that
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:12.120]  business they're just getting out of it you can't follow the law because as you
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:16.840]  say if you do one thing you're in violation of certain statutes you do
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.200]  the opposite you're in violation of other statutes so they have you coming
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:26.200]  and going so no matter how careful you try to be no matter how well you practice
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:32.080]  your your art your subject to arrest and imprisonment and of course you've got
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.320]  the media on the side of the government who's going to tell the government that
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.240]  you were a crook and you were cheating the patients and you were harming them
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:44.360]  and you deserve your prison term yeah I've seen this happen numerous exactly
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:47.440]  but if you're a part of a big mega corporation you've got the lawyers you
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.320]  control the politicians you're left alone so it's big insurance companies
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:56.000]  trying to take over the market with the government in a fascist takeover stay

[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.480]  with sword and pistol by my side
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:22.920]  folks you know if I sound upset here on air it's because since I was five years
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:28.120]  old my dad's been a dentist and then an oral surgeon and he he wants to keep
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:33.520]  working but he just says he can't be part of this they make it impossible not
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.400]  to break the law and that's why I saw a statistic can you guys pull it up I think
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.920]  it was in the Associated Press two weeks ago they had a national Gallup poll of
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:49.280]  doctors and they said 61% planned to retire early and everything gets blamed
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.760]  on the doctors the corrupt HMOs the big insurance companies who now tell them
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.880]  what to do you know we're gonna come back and get into the excitotoxins and
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:03.080]  pushing aspartame with dr. laylock but but but right now dr. laylock joining us
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:09.120]  here today get into what the legislation does itself because now it's not you
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.680]  saying this five years ago because you'd read the bill nobody else would it's now
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:19.400]  mainstream oh your premiums up 53% in 2013 oh it's gonna double by 2015 oh it
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.080]  is gonna make everybody quit oh it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions oh
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:29.480]  it was written by big insurance companies oh oh the select corporations in
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:36.600]  Congress are exempt on and on and on and on dr. Russell
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:40.960]  laylock well this is the modus operandi virtually every socialist government in
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:48.440]  the world I mean you review the history of how the United Kingdom adopted its
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:52.560]  socialist healthcare system it's the exact same thing what they do in the
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:57.880]  beginning they paint this beautiful pure picture I call it a mural a socialist
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:03.120]  mural and they tell everybody look this is what it is going to be like and they
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:07.200]  tell everybody just keep looking at the mural of where this is going to be
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:13.200]  disease is going to decrease because of all this intensive healthcare the
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.440]  number of diseases are going to fall dramatically and therefore calls will
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:20.400]  fall in a paper itself all this was said in the beginning the doctors were told
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.800]  look doctor we want your advice we want your own panels and boards here we're
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.880]  going to set up a room you write what you think the system ought to have a cut
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:34.920]  success so they build all this beautiful picture then it's approved once it's
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:38.480]  approved they tell the doctors that they were the right stuff so we we're not
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.600]  going to need any of your material so you can stop writing they tell the people
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.520]  just keep looking at the mural and then there's disaster piles in front of
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:54.600]  disaster patients are being harmed and in tons of thousands of cases they tell
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.720]  them well do you know this is because there's there's doctors are resisting
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:02.880]  doctors are sabotaging us we just need to have more laws to control the doctors
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:08.640]  everything's blamed on the doctor and so this motorcycle ride not repeated over
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.640]  and over and the historian to have analyzed the system carefully stated
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:18.600]  that the characteristics of socialists is every time the system fails they just
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.800]  redouble their efforts they never admit well it just doesn't work well it's a
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:27.400]  disaster they always redouble their efforts they make it more pressing they
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.840]  add more laws more punishment they try to seek out more enemies you know in the
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.800]  Soviet Union they label them the enemies of the people and of course that's the
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.320]  image they want well this is not working because we've got enemies of the
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:46.640]  people sabotaging it the doctors are too greedy the doctors are doing this and the
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.000]  public comes to believe it because it's all par paraded by the media that they
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.280]  control the doctors have no voice you rarely hear from doctors what's going on
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:02.680]  and as I've watched this slowly evolve over my lifetime none of the stories of
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:08.160]  what was happening ever reached the media ever so the public is totally
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.000]  unaware they don't know any of this is happening I talked to people I said you
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.880]  know that that doctors are sent to jail for ten years because the operator on
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.480]  the elderly man corrected his cataract and he went from blind to being able to
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:25.200]  play golf I said that's unbelievable of course it's unbelievable but I know the
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:31.320]  case personally I talked to his family as a family of like six to seven
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:38.520]  children and now he's in prison because he helped a man see well that's what
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:44.320]  socialist systems do if you're a doctor and you're costing the state too much
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:50.360]  money by taking care of people you're punished because the idea is in a
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:56.160]  socialist system you have progressive denial of services that's how they save
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.720]  money the bureaucracy grows and that's where the money goes and the health care
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:07.560]  itself begins to shrink well who cost the most money the elderly the people
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.320]  with chronic illnesses so those are the people they concentrate on now if you
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:16.240]  don't believe this go to the tax-free foundation that deal with health issues
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.200]  for the last 50 years they've written about it over and over and over saying
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.360]  we need to find a way to discourage people from using health services
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:31.200]  particularly the elderly we need to deny operation they created this system of
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.280]  life here saying well if you have someone that's 65 68 years old they
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:41.480]  developed a bad hip we calculate how long could they possibly live and we say
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:45.640]  tell them well you're not tell what dr. Blalock stay there Russell Blalock MD.com

[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:30.520]  listening to Alex Jones if you look at communist art in the Soviet Union Cuba
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:37.160]  China Eastern Europe it's basically like the zeitgeist cult movement where they
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.160]  go look at these wondrous beautiful cities and free energy and all the
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:45.320]  science you're gonna have and you're gonna work two hours a week and we're
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:51.080]  gonna get all the rich people it's like grapes of wrath shows some real stories
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.040]  where small towns didn't want you know 20,000 refugees elements of the cops
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:59.280]  would beat people up which was wrong but the answer is communism that'll stop
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:05.360]  work camps and then communism killed over 150 million people the last century
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:12.480]  alone on record upwards of 80 million in China alone in actual work camps so
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.800]  they show you all these newsreels of spaceships and science and but they're
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:24.160]  anti-family they're anti-male they're anti-freedom what it is is a system of
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:29.440]  criminals and you've got big multinational offshore above the law
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:36.840]  corporations that on record fund socialism and I think that's my question
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.680]  for Dr. Russell Blalock MD retired brain surgeon and probably one of the
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:47.120]  leading voices exposing this everything you wrote for Blalock
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:52.200]  wellnesscenter.com newsmax.com everything that you put out has now
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:59.000]  unfortunately come out to be extremely extremely accurate and that's what my
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.840]  dad has said he goes they want to ruin all the health care they want to make
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.680]  everybody quit and that's what you've been saying now they're announcing they're
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.920]  gonna bring in the foreign doctors now the cover of Newsweek says yeah the case
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.160]  to kill granny Bill Gates now now this law says yeah we are gonna kill an old
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:17.960]  lady and hire 10 teachers and the teachers clap because they really believe
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:23.400]  that if somebody loses they win now the communist wavelength the communist
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:29.920]  phenomenon has now begun but with ultra-rich like Warren Buffett sitting
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:36.080]  on top of it why don't we see pressure from above pressure from below Dr.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.360]  Blalock and then other points about how this is going to be implemented in ways
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.000]  to fight it well you know the genius of the revitalized communism with
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.440]  Antonio Gramsci and he told them they said you know your marches of
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.400]  Leninism take you a little bit your Leninist policy of terror and war and
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:59.800]  mass killing is no longer going to work he said you need to use as you said
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:05.880]  pressure from above pressure from below and just gradually evolve the society
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:12.600]  into a collectivist socialist country and it'll happen before they know it
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:18.000]  they won't recognize it till it's done well if you follow this as long as many
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.720]  of us like Dennis Cutty and and I have and Miguel Ferreira what you find out is
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:31.040]  you've watched this you've seen this evolution this slow gradual collectivism
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:36.280]  well we're at the end point and that's why this president who's just a puppet
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:42.680]  he's not the generator of these things he's a puppet but we're seeing all of
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:46.400]  the pieces fall in place now they said well you know we built the structure
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.240]  from below and from above now we're ready to implement the final product
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:58.560]  which is collectivism and collectivism does not recognize individual so when
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.520]  you as an individual say well you know my hips are hurting every night I can't
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:09.000]  hardly walk 70 years old and I need hip replacement the doctor agrees but the
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.520]  state says well our actuarial table says that you may not live more than two to
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.640]  five years and it's not worth it so here's a stick you can walk around on
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:24.320]  and here's some pain pills that's the new medicine people don't understand that
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.880]  they they they're looking at the the shiny light that says your health care
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:36.120]  will be free well what's free is the stick not the surgery in their mind
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:40.920]  they're saying oh I get free hips now you get a stick to walk around on the man
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:45.920]  with the advanced cataracts is told in his mind he thinks oh under obama care
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:52.840]  I get free cataract surgery no you get a white cane with a red tip on it and you
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.880]  can sit in your house and listen to the music on the radio that's what you do
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:01.280]  for your health care they don't understand that and it's what I say is
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.640]  the socialist paints of beautiful mural if you look at the propaganda art of
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:10.760]  China it's very instructive all the pictures are smiling children everybody
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:15.240]  clothed everybody happy everybody enthusiastic about their work but so
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:20.480]  baloney it's just a fake reality unfortunately most Americans are
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:24.560]  looking at this mural and they're not looking at at the true reality they
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.160]  don't read they don't look at the the writings of these people that are the
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:34.200]  leaders of this because they clearly stated that Brazil's key the big new
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:41.560]  brzezinski who played the number one part in choosing Obama as a presidential
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:46.880]  candidate and he appeared on MSNBC and said this is the most qualified man to
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.680]  be president of the United States well if you read Brzezinski who was co-founder
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:56.560]  and head of the trilateral Commission one of the most powerful groups in the
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:03.400]  world he states his admiration from our system and he said well yes we had some
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:08.520]  totalitarianism but we've learned from that and the greatest thing we could do
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:16.320]  is continue this this Marxist revolution so here is a guy that's one of the
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.040]  co-founders and heads of one of the most powerful organizations in the entire
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:27.920]  world in terms of foreign policy economics you name it education and the
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:33.120]  people he's collected within this organization and he's saying the most
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.280]  qualified candidate the Marxist someone who's going to fulfill the Marxist
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:42.720]  vision and we'll tell him how to do that so you don't look at Obama and say oh
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.320]  this is Obama caring it's the bomb of that above this and if we could just get
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.520]  rid of a bomb everything be caught now it's the spring pullers in the shadows
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.960]  the Rockefellers the brzezinski the Kissinger's the people that are members
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.000]  of Bilderbergers and Council on Foreign Relations you know one of one of
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.640]  their chief protections as they tell the public well you know people who think
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.880]  that are conspiracy theorists they're dangerous you shouldn't even listen to
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.800]  that you know it's all ridiculous there's no evidence whatsoever so don't
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.360]  even look at it what Dennis Cutty has spent his whole life as a historian
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.080]  studying this in great detail all of his books documented it's all highly
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:30.720]  referenced he's a meticulous historian I know him personally you read his books
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:35.200]  you'll find the truth but they're terrified of the truth I recently wrote
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.520]  an article for a friend of mine's website and then titles article is when
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:45.320]  rejecting orthodoxy becomes a mental illness and what I would spurred me to
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:52.760]  write this article was magazine article and Scientific American mind in this
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:41:00.880]  the article states that people who do not believe in global warming are not
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.520]  only a danger to society but they're mainly ill they have a form of
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.840]  schizophrenia oh they had psychology today two years ago with a former clint
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:15.520]  administration official come out and say I am insane because I believe there's a
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.120]  plan to set up a corporate world government which I can watch Davos and
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:23.200]  see him on c-span saying and and they know full well what they're doing last
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:30.720]  week MSNBC said libertarians were behind the bombing in Boston and that I'm the
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:37.840]  leader quote the the the mad prophet and that I am a deeply racist person in Dr.
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:43.920]  Blalock they didn't show one piece of evidence I mean this is really beyond the
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:49.560]  Soviet Union in how transparent the propaganda is let me ask you this question
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:55.200]  how well is it going for them well it's very successful and the reason it's
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:01.200]  so successful is because this this intrusion into the American Republic has
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:09.120]  been occurring at least since 1902 in a very progressive way they made sure that
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:15.000]  they infiltrated the education system through the creation of the NEA the
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.040]  National Education Association which was a creation and funded by Rockefeller
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:27.880]  Foundation and Ford and Carnegie they set the curriculum they made sure the
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:32.160]  textbooks were rewritten to give the globalist perspective all of this is a
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:37.360]  matter of record it could be checked it's historically accurate but what they
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:42.040]  tell the public is don't listen to those people don't look at their evidence you
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:45.360]  know and I use an example in my article I said when the during the fluoride
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:53.040]  debate professor and head of dental school told their students that when they
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:59.000]  debate people about fluoride are gonna talk about for us and never debate the
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.160]  anti-fluoridationate because they'll always win you know because they have
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.000]  all the facts on their side they presented only when you're on a post
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.320]  well that's the way they're trying to create this situation now is that anyone
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.520]  who points this out and says well here's the evidence look at it they want to
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.200]  make sure no one looks at the evidence so they just discount you as a loony and
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.920]  and not only a loony but now according to this article you're mentally ill well
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:31.200]  that's what happened in the Soviet Union you know they used to put people in
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:36.480]  gulag well when you look at the Obama campaign posters they are famous Soviet
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:43.360]  era style done I mean it's open but Americans almost don't have an immune
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.440]  system to charity because it's been so long since we were under it we're almost
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:51.400]  like Native Americans exposed to smallpox we don't even know what hit us
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:56.560]  but expanding on this they have articles every year right at the start of
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:01.320]  school happening right now that we cover that say there are no side effects
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:06.400]  anyone saying it is a liar anyone saying it is a fraud well anybody could
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:11.560]  read the insert and see that and I just think about the Ryers who were know
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:17.120]  they're lying but who go along with this feeling like they're part of the
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.160]  winning team I want to tell the middle class something you're always the main
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:25.960]  target of the authoritarians once they take over especially collective as
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.360]  communist and I want to warn the police and military everybody else you're not
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.840]  going to be allowed to continue on in your way of life once this fully comes
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:39.000]  in you are the number one targets dr. Blaylock you're a historian in your
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.720]  own right and studied all this with a doctor's focus am I wrong in saying that
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:48.400]  the fools that open the drawbridge to let the enemy come in and do this are
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.040]  going to be the first on the chopping block well Robert Conquest wrote a
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:56.280]  little book you know he's a world expert on Soviet communism and Chinese
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.800]  communism and he wrote a book what to do when the communists come is about what
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:05.560]  would happen if there's a communist takeover America and he lists all the
[01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:10.640]  groups and he said most people think the number one target of the new communist
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.760]  rulers will be the John Burt society or some conservative group he said it won't
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:18.760]  it's going to be the most left-wing group it's going to be the the left
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:24.600]  fascist it's going to be the extremists who brought help bring them to power
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.920]  because they can't trust them so all the people out here going along with the
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.360]  program and helping them out and helping them lie you're going to be the
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.760]  first victim they can't trust you they and Lenin even talked about it says
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:41.400]  someone who betrayed their own country can't be trusted so even though we like
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:46.240]  them and because they help us win once we win they're the first one to
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:51.200]  eliminate you know there's a picture of Lenin with six or seven members of the
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:55.280]  original revolution they said in the picture Lenin is the only survivor all
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.840]  the rest were killed and and that's true you know they went through these
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:05.200]  programs where they just killed all the original revolutionaries except for a
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:10.800]  handful that's right anybody can search the term Lenin and photo shop
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.440]  revolutionaries and they'll see the original leaders that brought them to
[01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.520]  power all of them executed all of them tortured to death all of them killed and
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.880]  then later they just put new faces in and then they did that each purge I mean
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:30.120]  we're bringing in a nightmare system folks that tramples and you are trampled
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:35.200]  upon George Arwell worked with the communist and then worked in MI6 and
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.800]  found out they wanted to bring in Ingsock and he wrote 1984 against
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.160]  Stalinistic communism describing exactly what would happen under a system like
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:51.200]  this and and and folks that's why I get so upset is that I love this country I
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:57.520]  love my family and we know the path we're on and it's so painful to to I
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:01.640]  mean dr. Boylock I know as things unfold and you're proven right you're not
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:05.360]  happy about it you're upset that you were right you're upset that we didn't
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.360]  stop this it's not like we're up here saying oh we're grandstanding we know
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.800]  everything you don't we just want to have a future am I right in saying that
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.880]  sure I wish I was wrong that would please me more than but I'm wrong and of
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.280]  course that's sort of what's happened throughout my life as I watch this all
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:26.720]  taking shape I kept hoping well maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong maybe people are
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:30.720]  gonna wake up maybe they can vote these towns without maybe the people of past
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.440]  laws to protect themselves against this tyranny but it's just not happening so
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.880]  I don't want it to be true that's for sure you know I have family I don't I don't
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.480]  want them to suffer under this system and I've read every account just about of
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:48.920]  us the life under these systems and I can tell you you have no idea how
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:54.920]  horrifying it is you know read the book man is wolf demand every control freak
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:59.760]  scumbag is given power it's horrifying you know all these people have come
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.600]  forward from every communist system in the world have written books about their
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:10.000]  experiences and you can't even imagine the horror of it well sir I really
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.840]  appreciate your time we've only got about two three minutes left and again
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.800]  thank you for spending time with us in closing the original reason I got you
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:21.040]  on what do you make of Coca-Cola coming out saying aspartame doesn't make you
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.680]  gain weight and it mad for you as all the mainline studies pile on confirming
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.360]  your original research on oxytotoxins I mean is this just them desperately
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:35.000]  trying to stem their sales imploding I mean is this a sign of our victory yeah
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.240]  they're losing a lot of money on their diet cola drink and it's snowballing
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:44.160]  because people are starting to wake up and so they want to protect that thirty
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.920]  five point one billion dollar revenue they have so this is the protection but
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.400]  again where's your regulatory agencies that have looked at this research which
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:59.120]  is extensive and shows this aspartame is very damaging to human health I thought
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:03.200]  they were supposed to protect it where are they well they're in league with the
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:07.480]  coca-cola company and the best co and all the companies that they've made these
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:11.760]  these products they're protecting them they're shielding them and that's what
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:15.600]  you see with these so-called protective regulatory agencies they've become the
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:21.640]  shield for the multinational globalist corporation you're absolutely right
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.520]  briefly in the minute we've got left breakdown what aspartame does sir well
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:31.600]  aspartame in your stomach combines to form a nitrosamine carcinogenic compound
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:36.560]  when it's absorbed from the GI tract it goes to the liver and and the methanol
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:40.840]  is converted to formaldehyde which is highly carcinogenic and it's been shown
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:47.080]  to produce breast cancers lymphoma leukemias brain tumors and of course the
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:51.120]  fastest growing malignancy in people under age 30 is lymphoma leukemia I've
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:56.520]  never seen so much so you have to also keep in mind that the combined toxicity
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:03.280]  and you combine aspartame with pesticide herbicide mercury you just magnify the
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.880]  toxicity to the brain as well as carcinogenicity so the more these things
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.640]  you allow in the food supply the worse this problem is going to be but I have
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:21.560]  been shocked at a number of leukemias and lymphomas I've seen it's just
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:25.920]  unbelievable and the cancer rates are just exploding across the board and now
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.080]  they're putting it in thousands of products and it just shows the sheer
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:36.320]  madness that we're under well dr. Blalock Blalock wellness center dot com

[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:46.480]  serious situation and I just said that hey anybody that says that Fukushima is
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:53.360]  a serious situation is a conspiracy theorist and a racist because that's the
[02:00:53.360 --> 02:01:00.240]  answer now and I've had people in public that watch MSNBC now walk up and go
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:04.520]  well but isn't the racist and they're all like feeling good because their God has
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:10.840]  said I'm bad and they associate their personal power with the system and you

[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:44.400]  that's fine I mean the truth is you people are the ones pushing all the
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.080]  race stuff and are really the race pimps because at least an ignorant racist who
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:52.360]  just hates people because of what color they are at least they're just an ignorant
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:56.520]  idiot you people are like in a cult of like you're in the country club and

[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.440]  phone call here chat in Maine thanks for holding you're on the air welcome hey
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:21.000]  yeah you know I'm well I'm racist obviously but you don't want to race
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.920]  the stuff the last two hours have you as I heard quite a bit of racism in the
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:30.240]  last two hours yeah I just I had a I had a couple things I wanted to go over I've
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:33.600]  noticed I started listening to you like eight months ago the beginning of the
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:38.480]  law is less than yeah buddy months and I've learned a lot and I really do want
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:42.400]  to thank you about that I also want to thank you for being part of the reason I
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:48.640]  come back to Christianity you've really broke down the walls of you know how
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:51.880]  society is they want to put up the wall so nobody can link anything so nobody
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.240]  has any knowledge and you've really helped break down the wall so I can
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.120]  piece it together myself well I know this even if you don't believe in God and I
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:04.760]  do and I and you obviously do as well the the universe is a complex place the
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:09.720]  point is is that we're saying we believe in this and what Christ said not what
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:14.240]  Mao Zedong or Lenin said because the state is going to become God if we don't
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:18.520]  have another God so I just tell the atheists and everybody shut up and not
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.600]  all atheists but most of them their God is the state or their God is power or
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:28.120]  their God is SNM I mean I've just noticed most atheists are always also don't
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:32.760]  like the family or don't like and then think we're all idiots because we believe
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.400]  in something else in the universe and I'm just tired of being you know they're
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:42.040]  not really tolerant they want us to adopt their mindset they're on a crusader a
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:46.600]  jihad always telling me that you know not that I need to be tolerant because I
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.720]  am extremely tolerant but that I need tolerance one thing no no I need to not
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:57.000]  have any views I need to let them pour into my mind whatever they want me to
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.360]  believe that's not tolerance that's fascism and they are a bunch of fascist
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.520]  scum and under the Democrats we're seeing the greatest move of tyranny
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:10.520]  America has ever seen undoubtedly it is a full court press to wreck the country

[02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:57.960]  market
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:59.400]  the interest rates would go up
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.520]  that's now happen like he said it would
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:03.400]  at the beginning of it has

[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:23.320]  war on the press
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:25.560]  with greenwald having his partner
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.920]  stopped in all his data stolen
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.120]  that we're flying into the u k about all that
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:32.240]  so uh... max keiser thank you for coming on
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.160]  i've got a lot of pieces of info there
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.040]  uh... what do you want to tackle first
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:42.400]  i just want to pump up the energy i want to pump it up i feel i've been
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:43.760]  listening to the show and
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:44.840]  we need to pump it up
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:49.040]  let's get let's get let's get that energy going now you you your people contacted
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:52.360]  me and i said oh let's talk about the hindenburg omen of course is very
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:54.840]  exciting but the bond market is
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:57.000]  as i said a year ago on your show
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.080]  in around
[02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:00.280]  april of twenty twelve i said
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:04.360]  and around april fifteenth of twenty thirteen that the bond market would peak
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.760]  it peaked about two weeks later not two months two weeks later and it's been
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.360]  going down ever
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:12.680]  since alex so the bond market
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:13.720]  is now
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:14.880]  reversing
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:19.640]  a thirty-year trend and this is the beginning of the bond apocalypse
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.520]  and this is the beginning of the massive unwinding
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.800]  this is the beginning now of the ponzi scheme known as the
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:28.520]  american and u k economies
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.420]  now heading into the toilet
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:34.040]  this is it this is what we've been talking about and it's it's happening now
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:38.240]  and it's getting quite serious because interest rates are now starting to raise
[02:11:38.240 --> 02:11:39.740]  everyone's mortgage rates
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.440]  everyone's cost of capital
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:42.960]  and it's causing
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:47.080]  corporations like you talked about coca-cola earlier coca-cola
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:49.480]  their sales are collapsing because
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:53.280]  baby boomers don't want to be poisoned by coca-cola anymore so coca-cola is
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:54.880]  becoming quite desperate
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:58.280]  and they can't get the cheap money anymore because for years
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.520]  these big companies
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:03.640]  funded themselves with interest rates near zero percent or a rising bond market
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:05.080]  now that's all reversed
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:09.400]  they're getting more desperate and they're engaging in more desperate acts
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:13.600]  and this is why you've seen the corruption the medical establishment in america the
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:16.560]  wall street of course is highly corrupted the corruption now
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:20.560]  is spreading to every facet of american life and that's going to only increase
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:21.360]  because
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:23.960]  you can't get access to cheap money anymore
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:27.460]  because the thirty-year bond bull market ended
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:29.360]  just as i predicted sure sure
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.440]  but i mean all the gift horse of the mouth i mean to be technical
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:33.520]  uh...
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.880]  the middle of last year you said by the end of april
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:39.560]  you believe that the bond market would implode
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:43.000]  and then about two months after that it did begin to implode
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.280]  and i know you started two weeks later it started interest rates started to
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:47.120]  to move up
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:51.240]  so that you know that is uh... you know that is what i said six one way half a
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:52.920]  dozen the other the point is you were right
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:55.600]  so tell us what's coming next
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.560]  uh... had let me put this in the context had you made
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:01.880]  a bet against bonds
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:07.080]  at the appropriate time you would be up a substantial percentage point okay so
[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:11.200]  that's the key metric always is what have i done for you lately
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.760]  and i was at was that bill de berg and i met some of your followers at bill de
[02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:16.600]  berg and somebody came up to me and i said
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:19.440]  what would be the single investment you would make right now and i said
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:20.600]  sell short
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:26.320]  tl t which is a listed exchange trade is not so you do that i saw you do that
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:30.440]  and that that investments now up substantially in just a few months out
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:36.400]  that's the kind of trend analysis that i think so going forward alex the
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:38.800]  bond market as i've said
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.360]  is heading into this secular bear market which means interest rates are going
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:44.520]  to keep going up
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:49.080]  and this means that the cost of funds for these corporations and for the
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:53.600]  military and for all these contractors it keeps it rising and so to keep
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.560]  themselves making money they're going to get more desperate they can be more
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.440]  stealing of money out of bank accounts like we saw in cyprus or as we saw in
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:02.480]  mf global
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:06.640]  so you can see more of that going on people just what they call bailing in
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:09.120]  but it's just a confiscation of wealth
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.280]  you can see more capital controls like you see in india they're trying to
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:18.520]  prevent the passage of gold in india so that's a capital control
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:22.200]  uh... you're going to see all the invasiveness in the ns a scandal the
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.040]  prism scandals all about
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:27.040]  bankers and industrialists wanting to
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:28.840]  get together to stop
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:30.560]  anyone's attempt to
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:33.840]  come up with anything that would compete with his very corrupt banking system
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:36.560]  that's why they hate bitcoin because bitcoin
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:40.520]  competes with the corrupt banking system that's why they hate it
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:43.840]  uh... so the desperation levels only going to increase
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:50.040]  and we saw this in the u k with this uh... detainment of david uh...
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.840]  maranda who is the partner of
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:55.680]  glenn greenwald he was detained for nine hours under the anti-terrorism act
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.960]  that he threw airport right here in london so they're equating journalism
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:02.320]  or somebody who knows a journalist with a terrorist that's an active
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:03.360]  desperation
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.040]  in my opinion the point i try to make
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:08.480]  is i tie things to economics
[02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:09.400]  and
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:10.840]  for thirty years
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.760]  the cost of money has
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:14.120]  progressively cheaper
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:16.400]  because the bond market has gotten
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:19.880]  going through this bull market but that bull market bonds has been
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:22.680]  shown to be a ponzi scheme it's unsustainable
[02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.080]  now interest rates are rising so this level of desperation
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:29.320]  will just increase exponentially i believe so now we're at the
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:31.800]  really the end game i think alex
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.480]  now expanding on this the u k
[02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:37.800]  as you know a few years ago said that everybody in iceland was a terrorist
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:40.400]  that they couldn't have their bank accounts they couldn't fly out
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:43.880]  because they were bulking at paying foreign banks debts off
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:46.080]  but instead the government responded uh...
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:47.360]  you were obviously over there
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.520]  uh... reporting on it
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.160]  by arresting the different ministers and it turned out
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:53.800]  ninety plus percent of the debt was not theirs
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:56.400]  and they were happy to pay the debt that was actually theirs
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:59.960]  uh... so uh... now that's been unfortunately not really duplicate
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:01.480]  anywhere else in the world
[02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:04.560]  uh... to uh... any extent maybe a little bit in italy
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:07.120]  uh... so now we see the same paradigm
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:11.120]  uh... reporters are now terrorists their their friends are now terrorist
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:13.480]  uh... their associates are now terrorist
[02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:17.040]  and we have a time reporter who literally is the spinning image
[02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:18.640]  of a tool bag
[02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:21.920]  uh... coming out saying let's kill assange
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:24.160]  uh... i mean even if you're gonna kill somebody you don't brag about it in
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.120]  public michael groenwald
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.640]  i mean where are they coming up with these
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:32.840]  uh... these these these want to be tough guys who think it's real manly to
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:35.200]  talk about killing journalist and whistleblowers
[02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:38.000]  i mean just a parade of just sycophantic
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.320]  fops begging for tyranny
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:45.600]  well the it's been now exposed because for years again
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:50.120]  uh... whether it's that rising house prices in the u k or rising stock prices
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.160]  in america
[02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:53.640]  people overlook a lot of corruption if they're
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:56.080]  they think they're making money or they they think that they're going to
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:00.000]  benefit in some way and then once the tide goes out people start losing money
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.080]  uh... then these people are revealed for what they really are just stool pigeons
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:06.200]  you know for very corrupt
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:08.440]  neofascist regime as you have
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:10.680]  now in america and in the u k
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:13.520]  i just want to touch on a very important trend here which we've been talking
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:14.680]  about for years is
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:16.040]  in the gold market
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:17.600]  you know the price of gold
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:19.160]  has been
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:21.840]  really kept down over the years
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:25.280]  by central banks like the bank of england and others selling
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:28.920]  their sovereign gold or leasing it to the various banks
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:31.600]  around the world who in turn sell the gold
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:35.720]  and what we just found out this is really a hot story alster mclown of
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:39.080]  gold money dot com broke the story on my show a couple weeks ago the bank of
[02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.560]  england was caught
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:41.680]  uh... having
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.880]  leased out
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:45.440]  fifteen hundred tons of gold
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:48.400]  that now turns out has been sold
[02:17:48.400 --> 02:17:52.440]  is now in the possession of people in asia china in india so now the bank of
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:55.080]  england is exposed to this enormous liability
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:56.400]  and they just got this new
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:00.960]  central banker mark cardigan from canada is yet to make a comment on it
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:02.320]  now the bank of england have
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.840]  after having sold
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:08.280]  sixty percent of their gold about twelve years ago to bail goldman sacks out
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:11.680]  they've now been caught leasing out and then selling fifteen hundred tons of
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:13.440]  gold that's not their goal
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:16.080]  they are the custodian for other countries gold
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:18.600]  uh... germany as you know one of three hundred tons of gold delivered to them
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:21.360]  from new york they've been told they can't have their goal venezuela took
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:22.200]  their goal
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:26.600]  so all of the gold policy scheme all of the shenanigans in the gold market where
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:28.680]  the central banks to make a quick buck
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:31.600]  have been coordinating and colluding in
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:34.480]  sales and leases that end up flooding
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:37.920]  the system with paper money in the london bullying market association by the
[02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:38.680]  ways leverage
[02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:42.160]  a hundred to one that there is now this is my point there is now
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:43.640]  a run
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:46.400]  in the gold market just like you have a bank run
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:48.760]  uh... what we saw northern rock here in the u k
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:53.840]  there's now a run on the bullion banks a run on the central banks gold supply
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:57.440]  here in the u k around the world the fractional gold system
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:18:59.920]  fractional reserve gold system is now under
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.120]  attack you see two major indications of this one by the way uh... by the way

[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:23.520]  bombing thing well um the mainstream media
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:29.280]  um has decided that um they need to try to explain to their audience
[02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:33.200]  why america is turning into a hellhole and so
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:37.120]  they need to scapegoat somebody and they decided to try to scapegoat your

[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:58.000]  like are they that's even scarier that they're that crazy
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.320]  to say i'm behind the boss and bombing no proof and i'm deeply racist and not
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:06.960]  even say what i said i mean it's like that's like if i wanted to discredit
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:11.680]  my show i would do things like that to people i just

[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:22.000]  compare yourself to you know this is why bradley manning is going to spend the
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  rest of his life in jail jillian assange is it lives in a
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.880]  embassy here in london edward snowden had to seek asylum overseas i mean
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.960]  they're at the burning point of the spear in terms of rebelling
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:38.800]  against a tyranny you know they are the george washington's
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:42.240]  of our day and you are the paul revere of our day so
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:46.800]  and mainstream media is in bed with the monarchs they're in bed with the royalist
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:49.920]  they'll do anything to preserve their rent seeking
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:54.240]  and their gulag casino staying so and they're part of that all the all the
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:56.880]  new i agree with you i agree with you but i think
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:00.000]  coke admitting their profits are plunging and begging everyone to drink
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.120]  their poison and these guys saying i'm a racist with no proof
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:07.840]  i think it is chicken with the head cut off desperation
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:11.760]  well they can't see let me let me repeat something here because i think it's a
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:16.240]  very important point for 30 years every time a company made a mistake
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:20.240]  they could just write off the mistake and still
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.560]  be able to finance themselves because the bond market was in a 30 year bond
[02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:28.080]  market as of six months ago or a year ago
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:31.600]  the bond market which is where companies and governments go to get money
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:36.160]  has now turned into a bear market so coke they can't finance themselves as
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:39.200]  easily as they were able to the government can't finance itself that
[02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:42.240]  that's why the government buys 70 80 percent of its own debt
[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:46.720]  on all the western economies because it's the money is just drying up the
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:50.160]  liquidity is drying up and they'll say it's a liquidity problem you need
[02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:53.760]  a more quantitative easing more money printing but it's an insolvency problem
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:56.960]  these banks are insolvent the government isn't solvent
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:00.880]  but they want to deflect attention and they want to put Bradley Manning in
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:03.440]  jail they want to put Julian Assange in an embassy they want to put Edward
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:06.960]  Snowden into asylum and they want to put Alex Jones on the back foot
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:11.120]  because they need scapegoats because they are now
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:14.720]  in a position where they are no longer able to finance their
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.480]  opp... even Rush Limbaugh his audience is deserting him
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:21.920]  you know he's finding it difficult to go forward
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.920]  even those kind of mega coast-to-coast radio behemoths
[02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:29.600]  you know it's all coming on unwound now so the
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:34.480]  rush limbaugh is falling he's miles above the rest of mainstream media
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:37.840]  from the old helter skelter line coming down fast but i'm miles above you
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:40.800]  but i get what you're saying things are in deep trouble
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:44.000]  but finally you've been to Egypt you know the way the land
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.640]  i don't support military mowing people down but i know that Mubarak was bad too
[02:28:48.640 --> 02:28:50.720]  but they're trying to put the muslim brotherhood in
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:54.480]  that's even worse what's your take what's your take on all this craziness
[02:28:54.480 --> 02:28:58.560]  well i just saw a headline that Mubarak is now cleared of some charges and he
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:01.840]  may be back did you see that yes i did
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:05.600]  okay so um it looks like Egypt's come
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.280]  360s come full circle and uh it's a tragedy
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:13.280]  and um i know when i was in Cairo and i reported on your show from Cairo
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:19.040]  i was very excited by the arab spring and um i i really am heartbroken by the
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:21.920]  fact that nobody came to support the egyptians the
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:24.960]  americans left them to die just like they left the vietnamese
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:28.960]  to die nobody came for their help and now the bad guys are back in control
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:32.160]  it's another american turn your you know they talk a good game but when
[02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:35.840]  you have to deliver they they're not your friend they don't deliver they leave
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.640]  you to in them because it's not an american government it's a
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:42.160]  globalist government you know that max keiser thank you so much for your
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:44.960]  insight uh now get some sleep brother thank you so
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.240]  much for the time with us i joke because he always says as
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:53.040]  fast as bad time we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:30:00.960]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:04.880]  are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us

[02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:12.720]  the potential of information billions of dollars have been spent
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:16.560]  privately and publicly looking at how to

[02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:36.480]  can take total control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast you
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:40.720]  need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the opinion of the american
[02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:45.120]  people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war

[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:07.280]  raids but the point is they claim it's bulletproof bullet resistant
[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:11.440]  i mean it it's just they're going to steal everything just get ready

[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:46.400]  it took a lot of time to get those things in there

[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.360]  this book isn't the mumbo jumbo it's the reality
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:58.480]  clouded titles by dav creger available at infowarstore.com
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:01.360]  and everybody needs to read this because you can have a hundred percent paid for
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:05.920]  house that you paid cash for you can go to CNN pieces about
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:09.360]  you know where Bank of America foreclosed on the house that have been paid for
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:13.840]  for 10 years that was paid for with cash in you know in 2000
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:16.960]  and i mean that's a real case i just mentioned and the judge goes yeah you
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:20.160]  can keep it now another judge had him foreclosed on Bank of America so they
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:22.960]  actually gave the house back but that's when the people were
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:27.200]  middle-class and were lawyers and knew what to do basically
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:31.840]  the general public doesn't know what to do and now i mean i remember 10 years ago
[02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:34.560]  breaking all this down with experts on there people couldn't believe it
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.000]  you mean with mirrors you mean they've sold my house 10 times in derivatives or
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:41.440]  20 times or 30 times you mean nobody knows who has the deed you mean it could
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:45.440]  be paid for but somebody else has a deed saying they own it
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:49.520]  in china mainly the communist chinese are one of the biggest owners or the
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:52.160]  biggest one group and then your house is gone
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:57.120]  well we've got updates for you on this today because i saw a story
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:01.280]  last week that unsealed federal court documents we covered this
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:05.040]  show that yes trillions were stolen by banks in houses
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:10.080]  they never even had a deed to so now it's not just the deed was sold 10 times
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:13.280]  yeah there is unsealed court settlement records reveal banks told trillions
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:16.720]  worth of houses and then you scroll down it's actually got the source that's from
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:19.760]  boing boing but it was actually i think put out in the associated press
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:23.920]  the point is it's worse than that talking to Dave Krueger so it's perfect
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.840]  time that he's here with us today but
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:31.120]  this is what you've got to understand everyone i know it's not just banking
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.520]  but this is the big one with the mortgages
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:36.160]  every family member my wife who does the bills
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:40.080]  i'd bless her because i hate doing it my parents
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:44.880]  everyone i know paul watson in england his wife eon has her own bank accounts
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:47.680]  and stuff her own job and degree it's happened to her

[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:55.360]  100 times more than next month everyone gets mortgages that are wrong
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:59.360]  everyone has their it happened to me escrow was already paid escrow was over
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:03.840]  they stole the money started foreclosing trying to foreclose saying
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:07.360]  that i hadn't paid escrow and i had to then start the lawsuit
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.240]  to make bank of america who'd bought my mortgage
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:13.840]  four down the line i'd banked with a little bank didn't matter bank of america
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:18.080]  still did it and this was a decade ago okay so
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:22.080]  everyone thinks it's just happening to you my crew all on their lunch breaks
[02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:25.600]  what do you think they do every day they either go pick their kid from school
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:27.680]  who's sick or something like that or go pay a bill
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:32.000]  or they fight on the phone going i have the contract what are you doing
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.160]  folks it is a kleptocratic global corporate structure working with the
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:40.080]  collectivist governments and this happens when they bloom throughout
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:44.320]  history like a viral bloom or a red tide bloom an algae bloom
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:47.680]  you have blooms of corruption where they get control the regulators
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:52.320]  and no one's going to stop them so they're going to take everything you need
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:56.960]  to understand that unless we unify against them and realize
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:39:59.280]  that's one thing how to come in clark howard about he would talk about this
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:02.320]  even five six years ago i'll listen to him on local station i'm on five dining
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:05.200]  he would talk about no no that's standard they do this
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:08.800]  so it's all about seeing how can they cheat you
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:12.400]  okay then if a little guy double bills somebody by accident the feds will come
[02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:15.120]  arrest them but when it's done on purpose because
[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:17.760]  they're their lobbyists give millions of dollars a year
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:21.840]  they're above the law and uh dav creger you know you've got a long bio
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:24.240]  but why don't you tell people in a nutshell about yourself we're going to
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:27.680]  go into the next hour breaking down all this breaking news today you came to
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:31.280]  austin to be here with us today and i appreciate it
[02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:34.320]  and since you were on with us i don't know six eight months ago the big
[02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:38.160]  developments that have been unfolding well they have been and thank you for
[02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:41.040]  having me back on alex the the bigger picture
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:44.400]  you know when i started out doing title consulting was basically as a result of
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:47.680]  the book and once we started to do the title consulting
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:51.760]  then we found out that there became a need to assess chains of title
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:55.360]  and a chain of title is basically from the when the when the owner acquires
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:59.200]  the house he gets a deed it could be a warranty deed a security deed a grant
[02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:02.800]  deed depending if he's in california uh just depends on the circumstances but
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:05.680]  the deed is a representation of your ownership of the property
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:09.040]  and so what happens is when you sign the deed of trust or mortgage and i know
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:11.920]  you've been talking about mers on a constant basis
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:15.040]  well one of the things that i do as part of my service
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:18.880]  is we audit county land records and way back when i told you that we were
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:22.320]  auditing wiimson county but i was kind of tight lit because we were in the
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:26.240]  process of uh you know that's the crime syndicate north of austin
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:29.840]  yeah well this is this is actually we actually have a county clerk there
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:33.520]  nancy reister who cared enough to bring us in
[02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:36.960]  and let us do the audit oh so she's good yes she looked at
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:43.120]  she's showing she's so good uh we actually went through 5278
[02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:48.160]  mers related assignments from october 2010 to october 2012
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:52.240]  and basically we were looking for violations what we found we we managed
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:56.480]  to get through almost 1600 which is 30 of all those files
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:01.040]  we found suspect robo signing surrogate signing notary fraud forgery all
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:04.880]  suspect issues document manufacturing where the law firms would appoint
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:08.720]  themselves which of course drew out two particular law firms
[02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:11.600]  one of which is brice van der lin and warwick who
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:14.320]  want to have three weeks after the audit came out
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:18.000]  february 19th 2013 this came out january 29th
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:22.160]  february 19th january 29th they changed their name and their key players
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.000]  have reportedly jumped ship and ran we've got proof from the secretary of
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:29.600]  state's office from texas now here's the next well let me ask you this question
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:32.640]  it gets better out of thousands of counties nation why would you why
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:35.600]  why williamson county well one of the things is because of my
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:39.200]  relationship with the clerks in texas uh williamson county said look we've got
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:42.640]  to do something uh our county coffers are being depleted
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:45.680]  well i want to give them credit for something exactly well they usually do
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:47.360]  bad stuff yeah guess what they've done now
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:51.280]  here's two more contracts for you these are contracts that were just signed
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:53.680]  today by the county judge in williamson county
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:57.200]  williamson county is now going to file suit
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:00.400]  in new asa's county they're joining the new asa's county lawsuit in federal
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:04.560]  court against mercs corp and bank of america for unpaid fees in the land
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:07.680]  records in williamson county which has cost them tens of
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:10.800]  you know oh williamson county's man they're not getting money and now i
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:13.680]  understand he is now joining the fight that's how mean they are they'll even
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:16.480]  take on the banksters and they've retained the county that's
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:19.680]  actually with it won't just kill your two-year-old up there but go go go ahead
[02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:22.960]  no but anyway the county that's that's representing dallas county
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:26.560]  versus mercs corp now is being retained by williamson to go down to new asa's
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:29.600]  and corpus christy it does always seem like it's texas fighting
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:34.160]  you know what hey gotta love the spirit i just can't help it it's a dick thing
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:36.560]  but all right so so so tell us about all this
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:39.600]  well you know basically what you know when we did the audit
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:43.360]  um we had to make a presentation it's on clouded titles dot com that's the
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:46.560]  website and it's a video presentation and basically
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:50.640]  we we made the presentation january 29th before the commissioners court
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:54.560]  and ansy reister felt like you know it wears a situation where we sure we're
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:57.600]  going to fall on deaf ears if we go to the the commissioners court's going to
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:43:59.920]  fall on deaf ears i said well tell you what we'll do
[02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:03.600]  we'll audit every single williamson county elected official judge and we did
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:07.280]  it's all in the book copy for you sir oh wow
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:10.640]  so we've audited all the county judges the precinct judges anybody that had
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:14.800]  mercs involvement in there we actually found one of those elected officials
[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:18.880]  that represents williamson county had four mortgage loans running in tandem at
[02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:21.440]  the same time and i put a flow chart in the book
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:25.040]  to show them that and they couldn't wait to flip open to the section to read
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.680]  about themselves but you know it's funny explain this in layman's terms
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:32.800]  what's happening here i mean i mean you've gotten the government up there
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:35.600]  to understand how they've been screwed over so they're they're in they're now
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:39.040]  helping you investigate exactly what what we basically have here is we have all
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:42.960]  these banks way back in 95 started what we call mortgage
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:46.800]  electronic registration systems they are the banks the mortgage
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:50.880]  bankers association the fanny and freddy they're all involved in it
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:55.120]  and basically what they did was they they created one murz it didn't work
[02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:59.600]  freight another murz it didn't work in january first 1999
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:04.320]  they came up with murz corp ink and murz murz is nothing but a shell
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:08.480]  there's a new release out now explain explain that in layman's terms though
[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:12.400]  this was done because they didn't want to go actually file in the land records
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:15.120]  they wanted to create a digital system so they could sell it a hundred times
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:18.800]  exactly a counterfeiting operation here you're gonna love this at the same
[02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:21.360]  time that graham leach bliley repealed the glass
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:26.400]  steagle act here comes murz at the same in the same counterfeiting 99 boom
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:31.440]  out they go and and we have all of these basic so instead of counterfeiting
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.040]  dollars you you you counterfeit the deeds
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:39.040]  and one house is now 50 on average how many times do they sell these i see like
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:42.560]  10 times as the average at least at least 10 times so what's the real average
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:46.160]  well i mean you you know you could be you know i i told people in my classes
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:48.800]  that i teach one's coming up in chicago next month
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:52.000]  we tell them you know look they could literally it says
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.280]  in in your paragraph in your deed of trust that they could sell the note or
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:58.400]  a partial interest thereof they could literally literally split your note
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:02.800]  into 35 different pieces and sell 135 to 35 different trusts on wall street
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:06.000]  who then take it and convert it into driven and then they sell it again and
[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:09.280]  then they bet against it so because they know it's gonna but but but but how do
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:12.560]  they take people's houses that never even had a deed and paid cash
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:15.440]  10 years later because it's worse than that if they can get away with taking a
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:18.480]  house that they've already paid for why not just take one that never even had
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:21.680]  right exactly and the thing is is the reason that that that happens is
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:24.480]  because the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing which we found
[02:46:24.480 --> 02:46:26.640]  a lot of slander and title we found one example in
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:30.400]  Williamson County for example where a homeowner had two houses
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:33.760]  he sold one and the title company and the trustee
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:37.120]  appeared to have screwed it up to the point to where instead of what the house
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:40.960]  that he sold to this woman they used his legal description from his own
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:44.480]  property on hers when they did all the documents
[02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:47.440]  and everything in the system had his house on it
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:50.880]  his legal i was about to say i've seen that with cps in austin
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:54.240]  where they'll use a kid from five years ago taking your kid
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:58.000]  they don't even bring in a new file to the judge they just bring in a
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:03.680]  an old one and and swear it in i mean that makes like north korea look look
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:06.960]  not corrupt i mean what do you make of that well you know we knew that it was
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:09.920]  going to come back eventually to bite them you know where it counts but the
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:13.200]  only thing that these people understand is when we attack their pocketbook
[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:16.480]  there there's a brand new case out of california now that's just come out of
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:21.040]  the fifth district the pellet district called glaskey versus bank of america
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:24.400]  and everything that we've been saying in the book this case lends perfect credence
[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:26.960]  to by the way you're like five times more excited the last time you were here
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:30.480]  you're i am i'm you said this just broke last
[02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:34.720]  yeah this this particular news here with Williamson county is it hasn't even
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:38.400]  made the national wires we are exclusive on info wars com with this
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:41.120]  information thank you and i should add you you've been in the news a lot with
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:43.520]  some lawyers that are winning so you're but you know you're really on the
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:45.280]  vanguard of this let's go through some of this well
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:48.320]  i mean i mean keep breaking down what's happening here for people well you know
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.600]  in essence what we're seeing is we've got foreclosure mills that are also
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:55.680]  members of mers corp and this new piece called shell game mers contrived
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:58.080]  confusion by robert m jane's who's an attorney out of new
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:04.880]  mexico in 125 pages he drills down into the real mccoy about mers and mers corp
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:09.120]  mers has no money this entity is called the mers system and the way i explained
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:12.560]  it to the front company like the fellow reserve it's a storefront
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.080]  so what they do is they cut out they got this big umbrella
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:19.280]  and basically all the members are members of mers corp
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:22.800]  which has now changed its name to mers corp holdings ink
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:26.800]  and if you use the 2009 and you know every attorney needs to get this
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:29.520]  that's fighting foreclosure defense they need to get this piece
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:33.120]  and it's it's off of east sprouts dot com but they need to get this and read it
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:37.920]  because it it unveils where jane's got in there and drilled down even more
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:41.520]  to find out that the entire issues with where it says mers
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:46.240]  on your document actually means mers corp so that means mers corp which is
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:49.600]  really pulling the strings is not represented on your contract
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:53.200]  which means the entire contract is a fraud yes it's subject to challenge so
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:56.240]  it shows you oh my gosh that's why you're so excited that's why i'm
[02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:59.440]  excited so you know we're going to be teaching but their answer

[02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:11.040]  say chicago because we're on a great station up there but i've always seen
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:14.160]  that as one of their targets also for my own research but
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:16.480]  i will see how far likes to tell us what they're going to do but it'll be a
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:19.200]  small nuke they'll probably only kill like 10,000 people
[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:21.600]  they're just going to use the nuke they're going to detonate as a reason to
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:24.800]  bring in marshal law let me ask you this i don't mean to get off an aside issue
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:28.800]  here uh dav krigger but let's talk about this what would you do if you were this
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:32.080]  global banking mafia that's done this not just here but worldwide

[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:37.920]  big they're going to want your new war they're going to do something i mean
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:40.800]  because everybody's on to them now what are they going to do well you know what
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:43.440]  i did the day that we did the presentation to the commissioners
[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:47.200]  court i brought an armed bodyguard and when the clerk found out that i was
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:50.320]  bringing our bodyguard she had the entire room sealed off with sheriff's
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:53.200]  deputies to make sure we could get through the entire presentation
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.520]  we can't trust these people we don't know what they're going to do
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:59.520]  we have a dead notary in las vegas that testified against lending processing
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:03.200]  services which is an obvious third party document manufacturer

[02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:41.440]  that fraudulently were executed she signs the guy in california's name
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:45.120]  and then notarizes it and then it gets filed and she admits to it
[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:49.200]  she gets one count of notary fraud she's got a plea to day of sentencing

[02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:10.320]  these callers have been holding for a long time on a host of other issues
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:13.440]  so what i'll do is i'll run through some of those calls to wipe them
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:17.280]  off there uh alex and john and steven ed and robert

[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:25.040]  uh for dave krueger to talk about this big breaking news but the book clouded
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:28.560]  titles available at infowarstore.com or by calling toll
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:31.600]  three triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:35.280]  all right dave you got the floor continue here breaking down for people
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:38.400]  how how big this is and there's also other
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:42.640]  lawyers and other researchers having victories as well
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:46.320]  but i've also seen where attorney generals are trying to get laws changed
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:48.880]  to let the banks do this well if they do that
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:51.600]  the confidence in the free market economy is done
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:55.600]  that'll even ruin things worse than their scam so they're
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:58.800]  it looks like they're in a rock and a hard place here well the bigger picture
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:02.240]  alex is that when you've got uh again you remember the attacks they did on
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:05.360]  lanny brewer the assistant ag us a usa yeah
[02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:10.160]  he basically uh you know dismissed them and then went back to work for the
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:13.760]  company that represents merscorp the bunch that made the
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.360]  electronic database lanny brewer and eric holder the current ag of the
[02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:21.360]  united states worked for covington and berling
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:25.120]  in dc it's a dc law firm that represents merscorp holdings
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.600]  which is basically uh the large and i've read that as long as you hire them
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:34.320]  it's like by invitation that's the then you're allowed to not pay taxes you're
[02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:37.520]  allowed to be offshore but it's got to be certified by them
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:41.600]  and then that's like a made firm boom when they do it you're now in the gang
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:44.960]  well you know you wonder why the banks aren't being prosecuted it's because
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:47.520]  the ag has ties to the banks and that's how
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:52.080]  through covington and berling that's the assessed situation it's like a pelican
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:55.360]  brief literally it's it almost is except nobody's cars
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:59.440]  blown up yet well keep going all right well anyway so the
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:02.080]  the bigger picture and you were alluding to the fact that
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.200]  you could have a house at any time and all of a sudden you get a notice on the
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:08.880]  door and somebody's foreclosing on you this is not an uncommon thing and it's
[02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:12.240]  not going to be an uncommon thing because the left hand didn't know what
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:15.520]  the right hand was doing you have all these intervening assignees in the
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:18.720]  chain of title because they jumped and they left the land records when the
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:22.160]  first mortgage or deed of trust was recorded which was the security
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:25.600]  instrument that you signed you sign a note and a deed of trust
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.560]  well they take the deed of trust they leave it in the land records and the
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:31.920]  note goes out into wall street they literally could split it up into 35
[02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:35.040]  different pieces so isn't it ever gets recorded so it's the
[02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:39.040]  original transaction that's the real law everything else is fraud
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:41.600]  everything else passed out it's not recorded in the land records and
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:43.920]  therefore we don't know who actually owns your house
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:47.360]  and then the MERS system which disclaims itself for accuracy
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:50.160]  on the website where homeowners are supposed to be able to go look this
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:53.520]  stuff up well what actually happens is the MERS court members
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:57.280]  are putting on there what they want you to see it may not be the truth
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:00.880]  so it's basically a big obfuscation and smoke screen and this why would the
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:04.160]  establishment endanger the entire world political
[02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:07.600]  and financial system with a fraud this big the only thing i can think of that
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:10.400]  comes to mind and you know god forbid it would be happening here
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:14.160]  but the massive the the biggest massive land grab in american history
[02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:17.120]  and they all did it starting with the derivatives markets
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:22.400]  back in you know 2001 2002 and it just spiked in 2008 and then it collapsed
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:25.760]  let's explain that because i have a news article here today
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:29.920]  out of the association of corporate council city attempting to seize
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:33.600]  underwater mortgages via imminent domain constitutional objections

[02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:42.640]  and then nationalize it we'll be right back that's the plan

[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:34.640]  he's here with us in studio we're live but ladies and gentlemen
[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:36.800]  i know we've had folks holding for like an hour
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:39.440]  we're gonna get through these calls real quick on a host of issues then take
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:43.840]  calls specifically on the mortgage fraud and
[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:46.080]  where it's all going and it's not just in this country
[03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:49.120]  though we're the epicenter we'll talk about how do they think they'd get away
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:52.080]  with it because these big corporate swindlers
[03:00:52.080 --> 03:00:55.200]  and the law firms that work for them they always have a long-term plan
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:57.600]  and then they've got some of that they're going to make money out of the
[03:00:57.600 --> 03:01:01.440]  crisis later on so we'll ask dav creger about that coming up
[03:01:01.440 --> 03:01:05.600]  right now alex and chili thank you for holding down there in south america
[03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:09.520]  uh go ahead you're on the air hey how's it going um
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:13.760]  their uh your website is just a great clearinghouse for a lot of information
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:16.640]  and now that you have uh the reach uh through dredger port
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:19.680]  you're reaching millions and millions of people and i've heard you complain
[03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:22.720]  yourself that you have so much news going on and you try to red link so
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:25.920]  much but just as every single new news point comes out it keeps getting
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.240]  knocked down further further in the list and what i was thinking is and this would
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:34.160]  be a great opportunity to crowdsource a lot of your dedicated listeners
[03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:38.400]  uh and that is to add a link uh to the top of your webpage called
[03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:42.320]  don't believe me question mark and on that page you can have crowdsource
[03:01:42.320 --> 03:01:46.320]  uh listeners put together the different issues that people think that they
[03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:50.000]  should just dismiss out of hand as a conspiracy theory but have links
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.840]  have you know quick description of what the issue is and have links to the
[03:01:53.840 --> 03:01:57.440]  official uh supporting documentation whether it's the
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:01.120]  FEMA training manual whether it's the monkey virus whether it's uh
[03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:05.600]  you know the nazis using a fluoride to dumb down the people
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:09.600]  no i mean that's all great but i mean i've made films anybody can type in
[03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:13.440]  you know soviets and then nazis using fluoride to control crowds
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:17.440]  that's like a Pulitzer prize winning book has all that info from nernberg
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:22.720]  you can type in um you know any of the issues you just raised
[03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:27.920]  and it's right there already admitted uh you know that's just what's so
[03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:31.280]  frustrating about it is this stuff is out there in fact what was the first
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:36.080]  thing you mentioned uh i don't know FEMA training manual
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:40.560]  but i mean which FEMA training manual you've got the the FEMA camp re-education
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:44.000]  camp center stuff you've got the emergency centers establishment act
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:49.520]  you've got the civilian inmate labor camp program uh you've got um the army
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:53.440]  manual for re-education camps you just type that in you'll be at army.mil
[03:02:53.440 --> 03:02:56.560]  that's what's so frustrating for me and i appreciate your call
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:03.120]  is that this stuff is so unbelievable but everybody always says i heard on
[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:07.520]  alex jones even though we give him the source i i bet you run into this a lot
[03:03:07.520 --> 03:03:10.800]  i still hear people saying really they're taking people's houses that have
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:14.160]  been paid for i mean people just don't get that this type of corruption is
[03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:16.320]  going on what's because the right hand does not
[03:03:16.320 --> 03:03:20.320]  know what the left hand is doing and and after you have all of these people
[03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:23.680]  that have uh you know literally pledged their property
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:26.800]  into the system and the system has taken these notes and converted them into
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:32.160]  derivatives i mean the banks from 2003 to 2008 it reportedly made 53 trillion
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:35.680]  dollars making side bets called credit default swaps
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:39.120]  and literally they you know that the sad thing about it is they structured the
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:42.560]  loans it appears to fail and then they turn around and i mean
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:45.760]  that's where videos like inside job which i know you carry and i know you've
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:48.560]  seen uh came about you know that ferguson
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:52.160]  created and directed because of the fact that you know you see you start to see
[03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:54.640]  the bigger picture but then when you see the fact
[03:03:54.640 --> 03:03:56.560]  that you have all these intervening assignees
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:59.360]  what's to stop them from coming in down the road
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:03.600]  and saying hey didn't we have a piece of this guy's house at one time
[03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:07.200]  i don't think we've ever collected on it let's go get it then they hire a law firm
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:10.640]  at boom we got and what they're gonna do is create a big national
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:16.000]  office that taxes all homeowners to then pay homeowners back or to pay
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:19.600]  the assignees that's they bankrupt healthcare to
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:22.880]  socialize it but with corporate groups profiting from it
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:27.200]  it's fascism uh and and that's what i've gotten from all our sources is
[03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:30.800]  they plan on bankrupting the free market private property system in this
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:32.880]  country well what really really bothers me
[03:04:32.880 --> 03:04:36.240]  is this new path act that's going on right let's explain that when we come
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:38.880]  back and and and look i apologized all the
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:41.440]  collars i'm gonna have to wipe the board because it's not going to make sense

[03:08:10.480 --> 03:08:16.800]  and the gcn radio network that's right uh dave griggers laughing in our
[03:08:16.800 --> 03:08:19.920]  central texas command center line but it's true
[03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:23.680]  we're here trying to run the media operation against the globalist
[03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:27.920]  from little old austin texas and we are about the best there is which is pretty
[03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:31.600]  darn pretty darn scary in the final equation but
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:35.280]  uh they say a lie goes around the world before the truth puts on its shoes but
[03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:39.760]  in the end the truth will out man during the breaks you were just
[03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:43.760]  you just want a case against these guys a lot of other cases getting one
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:48.160]  so there is some still basic law out there but now they're trying to come in
[03:08:48.160 --> 03:08:52.240]  and create something other than mirrors uh before we go to these calls
[03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:56.080]  give people a lay of the land and some people say well i rent i don't care
[03:08:56.080 --> 03:08:59.120]  about a mortgage this is the entire underpinning of the
[03:08:59.120 --> 03:09:02.080]  economic system so i don't see how they're going to
[03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:05.440]  unwind it how they're going to stop it but if they don't stop it'll destroy
[03:09:05.440 --> 03:09:08.480]  everybody if they do stop it'll destroy everybody i mean
[03:09:08.480 --> 03:09:12.880]  where does this end it there is no end until they actually shut the entire
[03:09:12.880 --> 03:09:15.200]  system down elizabeth warren right now is
[03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:18.320]  is spearheading an effort to reinstate glass stiggle to get the banks
[03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:22.080]  out of the securities business completely so it's just you know it's one of
[03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:25.200]  those things that when uh when when we look at the bigger
[03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:29.840]  picture and you see uh everything that's going on in congress right now and you
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:32.160]  know about all these laws they pass oh here we go
[03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:38.720]  all right the uh for tv viewers president old i decided to have uh equal
[03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:41.920]  time today so president obama will be part of the show
[03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:44.720]  with us here but those who don't know i i am
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:48.720]  morocco obama you can believe me i will not raise your payroll tax
[03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:53.520]  not your income tax not one dime and the health care plan does not have death
[03:09:53.520 --> 03:09:57.680]  panels i love you i love you go ahead
[03:09:57.680 --> 03:10:02.320]  mr president i'd like to ask you uh mr mock president whether or not you're
[03:10:02.320 --> 03:10:06.720]  going to sign this path act into law if it comes on your desk
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:09.360]  well my friend bill clinton's going to help me out
[03:10:09.360 --> 03:10:14.000]  tell folks about the path act well the path act basically uh it it goes to the
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:17.360]  uh and what it claims to the very core of the issue
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:21.120]  but the uh if you read in the back pages and already professor adam leavenson
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:24.880]  who i know you know has appeared on panels attacking this and saying that
[03:10:24.880 --> 03:10:28.240]  it's you know a lame excuse for legislation but you know when you've got
[03:10:28.240 --> 03:10:32.960]  jeb hensarling from south texas there congressman who is you know spearheading
[03:10:32.960 --> 03:10:36.400]  this ever and trying to get the banks and everybody in you you bring one or two
[03:10:36.400 --> 03:10:40.480]  people in there that uh in essence uh don't like what they see
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:43.840]  that the biggest part of the problem is is the creation of a national mortgage
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:48.000]  registry which all of my people that are writing in that have read the book
[03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:50.960]  seem to think that they're going to codify mers well the problem is
[03:10:50.960 --> 03:10:54.880]  mers is a privately held corporation this is a national database
[03:10:54.880 --> 03:10:58.880]  maintained by a non-profit organization
[03:10:58.880 --> 03:11:02.400]  who's going to control that non-profit organization guess who gets to set it up
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:06.800]  the fhfa you know fanny and freddy's conservator
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:09.760]  just what i need i feel so safe with a conservator like that you know
[03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:13.920]  criticizing banks sounds like racist talk to me
[03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:18.880]  i think we need to get dav creger msnbc racist
[03:11:18.880 --> 03:11:22.640]  racist you're not behind the boston bombing are you
[03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:27.520]  no can't say it i am i don't do a very good obama no no i mean they're getting
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:30.800]  so desperate now being serious they're coming out
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:33.520]  and saying it's racist to criticize anything the government does you heard
[03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:37.440]  that new thing i i have as a matter of fact it's up on your screen too behind
[03:11:37.440 --> 03:11:41.920]  you but the uh the bigger picture is if this thing passes
[03:11:41.920 --> 03:11:44.480]  people are confused you know when you look at a mortgage people need to
[03:11:44.480 --> 03:11:47.920]  understand what mortgages are mortgages are something that represents a
[03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:51.600]  security interest in their property now the scary part about it is if you
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:56.720]  recognize that a national mortgage registry managed by a non-profit group
[03:11:56.720 --> 03:12:00.480]  non-profits can be manipulated and their administrative fees altered
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:03.920]  they can literally do anything they want but if you've got a complete database
[03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:07.440]  that the federal government has access to of every single mortgage indeed of
[03:12:07.440 --> 03:12:09.760]  trust every single security instrument in america
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:13.040]  they know where their property is they know who owns it at any given moment
[03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:16.160]  at least they think they do because the bigger problem with the mortgage
[03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:19.600]  electronic registration systems is because of the fact that they jump from
[03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:22.400]  the land records into their own database they've skipped all the
[03:12:22.400 --> 03:12:24.880]  intervening assignees out there all these owners
[03:12:24.880 --> 03:12:28.400]  that bought and sold these derivatives on wall street and so you know how is the
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:31.200]  federal government going to keep up with something like that
[03:12:31.200 --> 03:12:34.560]  that's been occurring for 13 years running so basically the mismanagement
[03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:39.280]  that brings down third world countries is now here it looks pretty dog on close
[03:12:39.280 --> 03:12:42.720]  so is that why they're buying billions of rounds of ammo and
[03:12:42.720 --> 03:12:46.480]  setting up secret military bases it's hard to say why they're doing that
[03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:49.680]  you know i mean it we're we're hearing that either homeland security's got it
[03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:52.080]  tsa's got it we have absolutely no idea what they're
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:53.920]  going to do with this stuff whether they're going to take it out and use it
[03:12:53.920 --> 03:12:56.640]  on target practice you know to perfect their uh
[03:12:56.640 --> 03:13:00.960]  well the tsa just bought enough for each agent to shoot 9 000
[03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:04.880]  plus rounds a day for a year straight and and why would the tsa need that much
[03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:08.080]  ammunition well the they actually admit they're
[03:13:08.080 --> 03:13:12.480]  trying to drop a supply for us that makes sense
[03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:15.520]  that makes sense i wonder what they've got planned that they actually don't
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:18.240]  want citizens having guns and ammo plus you failed
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:21.280]  we knew this before we already got plenty of guns and ammo you idiots
[03:13:21.280 --> 03:13:24.000]  i mean well they're just gonna come around us up it's gonna be like
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:27.440]  jolly old Stalin again and you're all just gonna be able to rob everything and
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:31.360]  have your way and kick our teeth in ain't gonna be that way you dirty foreign
[03:13:31.360 --> 03:13:34.960]  banks your little commie buddies not gonna be a cakewalk
[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:39.200]  and when we finally win the war you know you've heard of Nazi hunters we're
[03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:42.800]  going to have globalist hunters as long as americans
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:46.080]  still have hope and we still fight and we fight the good fight
[03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:49.840]  and remember now the way the court system is right now uh you literally have to
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:52.720]  be prepared to appeal these things because of district court judges we're
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:56.640]  finding a lot of them have derivatives backing their retirement
[03:13:56.640 --> 03:13:58.960]  plans these are the very things that were
[03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:02.240]  securitized using the MERS system and so there's a little but they should know
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:05.120]  they're never going to get it anyways if they don't fix things now this is one
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:07.280]  of the reasons why we audited the the judges in
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:10.000]  Williamson County to bring it to their attention look
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:14.320]  you need to realize what's going on here your own titles good luck selling this
[03:14:14.320 --> 03:14:17.120]  what happens if years down the road you sell it to a buyer
[03:14:17.120 --> 03:14:20.400]  and all of a sudden the bank from your pass comes back and forecloses on them
[03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:24.240]  guess what when you sign a warranty deed to a new buyer on your house
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:27.760]  and it comes before them and these people come from the back you're on the hook
[03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:31.200]  you're on the hook because it says you warranty to depend the title that you
[03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:34.160]  sold to the new buyer and if there's anything wrong
[03:14:34.160 --> 03:14:37.840]  and they get foreclosed on they're coming back after you we have cases going on
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:41.200]  in america just like that right now in fact you just want a case
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:44.480]  well we have a case right now where the bank actually settled with the home
[03:14:44.480 --> 03:14:46.880]  owner the homeowner had to give the house back
[03:14:46.880 --> 03:14:50.640]  but the bank had to give the homeowner money and the reason that happened was
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:53.600]  is that the mortgage got recorded before the warranty deeds so the buyer
[03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:56.800]  were was not lawfully possessed of ownership
[03:14:56.800 --> 03:14:59.840]  in the land records the land records represent constructive notice to the
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:02.480]  world we have people right here in austin as a
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:05.440]  matter of fact that i've done chain of title assessments for
[03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:08.080]  that literally there's no there's no legal description
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:11.040]  there's no legal description in the land records
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:14.480]  that says what they bought we have sellers conveying to buyers
[03:15:14.480 --> 03:15:19.040]  zero no legal description no citus address no commonly known as
[03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:22.240]  with their street address anywhere in the warranty deed and then we've got
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:25.280]  fidelity national financial coming back in six years later
[03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:28.320]  when Wells Fargo is trying to foreclose and they're trying to insert a
[03:15:28.320 --> 03:15:31.600]  corrective warranty deed into the land records and i've had title
[03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:35.040]  attorneys tell me they can't do that but they're trying they're going to do
[03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:37.760]  everything they can to get away with it and they're counting on the court
[03:15:37.760 --> 03:15:41.120]  system which i implore the court system there are some judges now that are
[03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:44.240]  actually coming around and starting to look at this if you live in the five
[03:15:44.240 --> 03:15:47.440]  boroughs in new york they're at least going to give the time of day
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:50.800]  up there in the five boroughs in the metro especially in kings county
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:53.680]  with judge shack who i talk about in the book he's my hero
[03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:56.720]  he literally has defended homeowners when they didn't even show up in court
[03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:00.160]  and told the bank sorry he haven't proven it up enough but with on the other hand
[03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:03.440]  we've got a majority of the judges especially if you live in states like
[03:16:03.440 --> 03:16:05.920]  colorado which right now they're looking at
[03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:09.840]  two major law firms for price fixing and the attorney general's office is
[03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:12.640]  actually investigating them this is the kind of corruption
[03:16:12.640 --> 03:16:15.680]  that you know we're trying to root out this is the kind of corruption folks
[03:16:15.680 --> 03:16:20.240]  that if we don't turn this around historically will bring everything
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:22.720]  down i mean all you people that want to go along
[03:16:22.720 --> 03:16:25.360]  with this and think you're part of the establishment
[03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:30.960]  this is country ending type garbage okay go because that's what the ropa dope
[03:16:30.960 --> 03:16:34.560]  scammers do like with too big to fail all this they keep you
[03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:38.480]  going but they never even try to fix it during the too big to fail agreement
[03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:42.160]  they just start scamming even faster like you know derivatives are up
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:45.840]  from what they were just five years ago they've only intensified all this
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:48.880]  correct but you know i want to allude to something you said earlier alex
[03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:52.080]  you were talking about renters renters sit by and say well that doesn't affect
[03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:55.600]  us well excuse me but they securitize commercial paper too
[03:16:55.600 --> 03:16:59.120]  the commercial paper has been securitized on wall street and literally the same
[03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:02.560]  thing could happen to your apartment complex and the bank had come in and
[03:17:02.560 --> 03:17:05.440]  kick everyone out and put everyone on the street because
[03:17:05.440 --> 03:17:08.800]  went all the money that you paid the landlord didn't it went to the landlord's
[03:17:08.800 --> 03:17:12.720]  pocket it did not go to the mortgage payment and all they have to do is get
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:16.320]  in the jam where they have a medical emergency or something where they need
[03:17:16.320 --> 03:17:19.440]  that money and they take that money and they don't pay the mortgage payment
[03:17:19.440 --> 03:17:22.400]  and that whole apartment complex is going to get vacated but i can't believe
[03:17:22.400 --> 03:17:26.320]  how the public always thinks about themselves like well i don't
[03:17:26.320 --> 03:17:29.360]  i don't have stock in coal plants and so what if they shut them down you're
[03:17:29.360 --> 03:17:32.720]  getting the power from it when they shut things down and get rid of due
[03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:36.640]  process it affects everything i mean if this continues
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:39.600]  and they continue taking houses that aren't theirs and doing this i mean
[03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:42.480]  what's it going to do to the economy oh i know and in florida they just passed
[03:17:42.480 --> 03:17:47.200]  hb 87 which basically was you know something concocted by a realtor who's
[03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:51.840]  a a state rep and what they basically are alluding to here is
[03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:55.440]  all the foreclosure defense attorneys are rallying in the state saying hey
[03:17:55.440 --> 03:17:59.600]  this is denial of due process you are going to allow a non-judge
[03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:05.120]  an unelected state judge an attorney who is a non-judge to get on the stand and
[03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:08.080]  sit there and help clear the docket in the next three years
[03:18:08.080 --> 03:18:11.440]  florida is going to have one million over a million foreclosures
[03:18:11.440 --> 03:18:15.600]  backlogged into the system which is 300 000 so they're creating a kangaroo court
[03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:18.880]  literally they're taking their creating a court that basically says well i think
[03:18:18.880 --> 03:18:21.760]  you know the bank owns it we got judges that say well if the bank didn't know
[03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:24.080]  that they wouldn't have filed a foreclosure suit so we're giving it to
[03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:29.120]  the bank thank you very much that is so crazy why would the bank lie well you
[03:18:29.120 --> 03:18:35.040]  know we the blaski read glaski versus bank of america folks dial it up glaski
[03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:39.440]  this is what we've been saying in clouded titles came out in glaski versus bank of
[03:18:39.440 --> 03:18:41.920]  america where all of these derivatives that were
[03:18:41.920 --> 03:18:46.320]  securitized on wall street in these trusts well the trust came after
[03:18:46.320 --> 03:18:49.520]  you know a bank bank of america is representing the trust
[03:18:49.520 --> 03:18:53.600]  and the judge ruled you know against the homeowner went to appellate court which
[03:18:53.600 --> 03:18:57.520]  is why i said you have to be prepared to appeal your case
[03:18:57.520 --> 03:19:00.880]  you know you can't just sit there idly by and think just because you got beat
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:04.240]  in in the state courts or in the federal court doesn't mean that you're not going
[03:19:04.240 --> 03:19:08.000]  to win an appeal because this is how glaski actually occurred in the state
[03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:10.800]  court what actually ends up happening with glaski
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:14.480]  is they're saying that the trust the way the note was conveyed into the trust
[03:19:14.480 --> 03:19:18.240]  pool who claims to own your loan it never made it there
[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:22.640]  because the assignment finally filed in the land records
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:25.920]  is six years too late each one of these trusts has what we call a pooling and
[03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:28.880]  servicing agreement and it has a cutoff and a closing date
[03:19:28.880 --> 03:19:31.840]  and if the note's not conveyed into the pool by the closing date which was
[03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:35.600]  generally 90 days after you signed the papers
[03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:39.040]  it never made the trust pool end of story it's avoid transaction
[03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:41.920]  unbelievable yeah and this is even what you're talking about it's even in the
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:45.440]  mainstream news now but it's kind of like oh big deal we'll figure it all
[03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:48.640]  out figure it all out i'm i'm seeing it the news all

[03:24:34.560 --> 03:24:38.800]  on the latest stuff going on Bank of America and others but right now
[03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:41.840]  we're going to go to your phone calls let's just ask you briefly who is the
[03:24:41.840 --> 03:24:46.640]  worst of all these big six megabanks we see more of well's fargo they hold
[03:24:46.640 --> 03:24:50.000]  more mortgages in america than any other lender
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:54.080]  followed by Bank of America than Chase there's a huge issue
[03:24:54.080 --> 03:24:59.120]  with Huamu and Chase because we're finding out now from depositions
[03:24:59.120 --> 03:25:03.280]  from Lawrence Nardi that Chase never actually got the loans
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:06.320]  and the FDIC was controlling this whole thing so
[03:25:06.320 --> 03:25:09.280]  you know we're still trying to drill down into that and every time we try to
[03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:12.720]  get close they move for protective orders which means they're trying to cut
[03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:16.320]  off our discovery obviously it's a procedural move and we still need to
[03:25:16.320 --> 03:25:18.720]  keep that this is the whole government the big
[03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:22.000]  banksters this is a premeditated deal you know it's hard to say it's
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:24.720]  premeditated but when you look at the cause and effect
[03:25:24.720 --> 03:25:28.400]  somebody's being influenced here because I can go to judicialwatch.org
[03:25:28.400 --> 03:25:32.480]  forward slash judge and hopefully I'm going to find when I do a background on
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:34.640]  a federal judge I'm going to find his financials
[03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:38.880]  Sam Sparks here in Austin has 15 Ginny May securitized portfolios
[03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:43.840]  in his financial statement that's recorded on judicialwatch.org
[03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:47.440]  forward slash judge and he was appointed by
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:53.040]  legislative and an act from George H.W. It's unbelievable and he doesn't want
[03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:56.240]  MERS cases in his court he bullies these attorneys out of here I mean this is
[03:25:56.240 --> 03:25:58.320]  what he he does every attorney I've talked to
[03:25:58.320 --> 03:26:03.680]  complains that he yells at him and says get that MERS case out of my face
[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:06.000]  unbelievable just let them do whatever they want
[03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:09.840]  Lisa New Hampshire you're on the air go ahead. Hello
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:14.000]  thank you for taking my call um I have a similar issue that you're discussing
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:17.600]  today Bank of America um had a system era
[03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:21.120]  they threw my house into foreclosure in their system and they started sending
[03:26:21.120 --> 03:26:25.200]  my payments back yeah yeah they call that a systems era
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:28.880]  yeah yeah and then it took a month to fix
[03:26:28.880 --> 03:26:32.720]  and then um the system showed there was no payments there so it threw my home
[03:26:32.720 --> 03:26:35.680]  back into foreclosure yeah no they want to be able to show
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:39.920]  from my research that repeatedly you were in foreclosure and they made a deal
[03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:42.720]  with you but you didn't keep it judge
[03:26:42.720 --> 03:26:47.200]  she's been back in the fourth three times we move you handed over immediately
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:50.400]  am am I correct if that's what's done some of the times I've seen that where
[03:26:50.400 --> 03:26:54.400]  oh we give you a chance now it's worse than that we have a case in
[03:26:54.400 --> 03:26:58.400]  massachusetts right now where all these Bank of America contract workers and
[03:26:58.400 --> 03:27:02.080]  employees whistleblowers have come forward with sworn
[03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:06.560]  statements saying that we were told to not
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:11.520]  do loan mods at all we were told the more loan mods you can deny
[03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:16.000]  the better in fact the more loan mods you deny and get into foreclosure
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:20.560]  the better chance you have to win a target or bedbath beyond gift card
[03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:25.760]  yeah gotta love that ruin old ladies lives for 50 bucks baby and this is
[03:27:25.760 --> 03:27:29.360]  this is judas did it for 30 pieces of silver you do it for nothing it's out
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:32.080]  there they they literally are saying we were told
[03:27:32.080 --> 03:27:35.840]  to just go ahead and continue to do what they call dual track
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:40.880]  in california they've now passed sb 900 which prohibits dual tracking if they
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:44.160]  grant a loan mod well what do you think i mean i don't i'm not a big fan of loan
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:46.480]  mods because of the fact i know that dual
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:50.080]  tracking is going on at the same time dual track basically means
[03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:53.600]  they're taking money from you even if it's reduced payments and then they turn
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:56.640]  around and they're foreclosing on you and moving to foreclose at the same time
[03:27:56.640 --> 03:28:00.480]  they're taking your money sb 900 says they can't do that anymore so that's a
[03:28:00.480 --> 03:28:02.640]  bit of a reprieve for california homeowners
[03:28:02.640 --> 03:28:08.240]  unbelievable let's talk to larry and michigan you're on the air go ahead

[03:29:14.480 --> 03:29:17.920]  you're ensuring the lender against all the misdeeds well the lender
[03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:21.600]  already if you ever notice these lawsuits the lender claiming to own the
[03:29:21.600 --> 03:29:25.520]  property is listed mer's as a defendant why is that
[03:29:25.520 --> 03:29:29.200]  because they're coming after and appears they're suing all the unknown

[03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:34.080]  by the way this song is about 1984 people think it's a love song it's not
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:40.960]  in every word you say the system wants to surveil us like we've done
[03:33:40.960 --> 03:33:45.680]  something wrong while it has been caught engaging in every form of crime
[03:33:45.680 --> 03:33:49.200]  abuse of the public you can imagine and it just goes on
[03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:54.800]  and on and then the tyranny the black uniforms the helicopters the surveillance
[03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:58.400]  is about protecting the corrupt ruling class that's taken over
[03:33:58.400 --> 03:34:02.480]  and it's not like they're corruptions making us wealthy the british empire
[03:34:02.480 --> 03:34:05.920]  if you actually served it aggressively you could actually get wealthy off of it
[03:34:05.920 --> 03:34:10.000]  in a lot of cases and then i would still say that was immoral
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:13.680]  but this is an empire we pay for and then go bankrupt
[03:34:13.680 --> 03:34:19.120]  and then they're all offshore and private jets going ah it's so hilarious to
[03:34:19.120 --> 03:34:23.600]  the new world order david krueger is our guest and and what an exciting
[03:34:23.600 --> 03:34:26.640]  document you have here i want to get through the next four or five calls and
[03:34:26.640 --> 03:34:29.360]  then have you make some final comments here and tell us about some of the other
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:33.920]  big news out there but yeah i wish this just wasn't true because it's creepy
[03:34:33.920 --> 03:34:37.440]  knowing this much institutional corruption goes on but hey if we let the private
[03:34:37.440 --> 03:34:42.640]  federal reserve since 1913 issue tens of trillions of their own fiat currency
[03:34:42.640 --> 03:34:47.360]  and get interest off of it well why aren't they going to start more uh
[03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:53.280]  elaborate forms of uh of usury and counterfeiting i mean where's the secret
[03:34:53.280 --> 03:34:56.640]  service when you need them because i'm no lawyer but i've done a lot of studying
[03:34:56.640 --> 03:34:59.280]  this sounds like something the secret service would get involved in because
[03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:02.720]  this debases the whole currency in the whole country well and then when you
[03:35:02.720 --> 03:35:06.560]  you try to introduce competing currencies like bitcoin and other things
[03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:09.840]  like that they shut it off you know when and this is something
[03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:14.640]  that's been ongoing um you know we have people trying to
[03:35:14.640 --> 03:35:18.800]  insert their own brand of justice this is a real problem because the system
[03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:23.200]  and i teach these in my in my workshops the system actually has tools
[03:35:23.200 --> 03:35:27.120]  to fight the system you use the system's own tools against it
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:30.400]  but we have so many people out there trying to put what i describe as a
[03:35:30.400 --> 03:35:35.120]  a giant square peg into a very small round hole which is our justice system
[03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:39.520]  and the problem is it doesn't fit and so you know and they wonder why they're
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:43.120]  getting beat up and the one thing that you know i have to clarify this and
[03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:46.240]  disagree with me if you want that's what the phone line is for
[03:35:46.240 --> 03:35:49.200]  but the thing is is when you move and this i teach you this in the in the
[03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:53.760]  seminar when you are in uh this constitutional mindset
[03:35:53.760 --> 03:35:57.120]  you know one ten one says obligation of a contract shall not be impaired well
[03:35:57.120 --> 03:36:01.200]  guess what they have mortgages they have decent trust those are contracts
[03:36:01.200 --> 03:36:05.120]  when you sign the contracts and closing if you want to help the system out
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:09.200]  and you go into closing and you see uh your deed of trust or mortgage
[03:36:09.200 --> 03:36:13.280]  and it has an 18-digit number underneath it that says mers mortgage identification
[03:36:13.280 --> 03:36:17.200]  don't be a party to the fraud walk away from it stop getting mers mortgages
[03:36:17.200 --> 03:36:21.680]  that's what they want you to do these refis especially are loaded with mers
[03:36:21.680 --> 03:36:25.600]  helox loaded with mers and by the way the only saving well that's a good point
[03:36:25.600 --> 03:36:28.960]  if the american people know all this now and go along with it
[03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:33.200]  they become a party to the fraud exactly yeah the house i just bought i told the
[03:36:33.200 --> 03:36:35.280]  bank i said no mers you don't sell it you don't
[03:36:35.280 --> 03:36:38.560]  securitize it you don't do anything with it you hold it and that brings us back
[03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:41.520]  to the last guy i love people i know that have been getting houses since all
[03:36:41.520 --> 03:36:45.280]  this came out the last really four or five years but in the decade before
[03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:47.920]  you can work with title companies you can go get it clean
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:51.120]  you can demand all that can't you well no actually the title company can't
[03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:54.480]  clean your file you have to go to court and do what's no but i mean
[03:36:54.480 --> 03:36:57.440]  i'm not talking about after the fact people are able if you do it right to
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:01.200]  go get a clean sale or cleaner right well a lot of that depends on what the
[03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:03.920]  title company is willing to ensure because once it gets into the mers
[03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:07.520]  system understand that you have somebody who own the property
[03:37:07.520 --> 03:37:11.040]  and then they're going to convey it to you but but listen you don't agree that
[03:37:11.040 --> 03:37:13.920]  they're allowed to sell it over and over again no i think that there's a real
[03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:17.360]  problem because of the fact that you know the note itself has been sold
[03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:20.960]  multiple times and you have all of these people oh so it's bad because you're
[03:37:20.960 --> 03:37:25.040]  buying a note that's already bad well no you're actually buying a property
[03:37:25.040 --> 03:37:29.040]  that may have been corrupted by multiple owners no no recorded their
[03:37:29.040 --> 03:37:32.320]  interests yeah that's the problem and you don't
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:34.480]  know whether those interests like you said earlier
[03:37:34.480 --> 03:37:37.280]  are going to come back down the road and bite you in the wait i mean what do you
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:40.880]  do but by uh i mean even if it's raw land it's
[03:37:40.880 --> 03:37:44.960]  going to have some history well not as much as uh you know with a house so you
[03:37:44.960 --> 03:37:48.320]  buy raw land and build on it that's my best bet and then don't go to the bank
[03:37:48.320 --> 03:37:51.200]  and don't get alone unless you happen to be one of those sounds like the way the
[03:37:51.200 --> 03:37:53.280]  old timers did it well you know what that's exactly
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:37:57.040]  what there there's a new uh video out that's not new but it's it was by
[03:37:57.040 --> 03:38:00.640]  john cambell and he explained the way the old system works you went to the bank
[03:38:00.640 --> 03:38:04.240]  you knew who the banker was the bank knew who you were he knew where you worked
[03:38:04.240 --> 03:38:07.040]  everything was local you didn't have to worry about i'm taking it and
[03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:10.720]  securitizing it on wall street you knew that he was going to record his interest
[03:38:10.720 --> 03:38:14.480]  in the land records and when you went down there you knew who owned your loan
[03:38:14.480 --> 03:38:17.840]  you knew who had a security and by the way that's how towns work everybody knew
[03:38:17.840 --> 03:38:20.720]  your granddaddy they knew you were a farmer they knew you were going to build
[03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:24.000]  this house and pay on it and and and that was the end of it you got the loan
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:27.600]  because they knew who you were exactly and they wanted you to make the payments
[03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:29.840]  banks really don't want to own your house
[03:38:29.840 --> 03:38:33.600]  you know but the way the system is now the bank said look we can make so much
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:37.840]  money taking all this stuff and and structuring these adjustable rate
[03:38:37.840 --> 03:38:41.040]  mortgages they're going to reset themselves years down the road
[03:38:41.040 --> 03:38:44.560]  that we already know the homeowner has a breaking point because we know he
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:47.040]  makes this much but if we can get him to get into
[03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:51.840]  house this much when it doubles and that's and that's what clinton did
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:55.680]  on record going we're going to get poor people loans it was a giant swindle
[03:38:55.680 --> 03:38:59.280]  well that would call liar loans or ninja loans but it's okay because he's he's
[03:38:59.280 --> 03:39:02.400]  the first black president you're right and if you're against ripping off black
[03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:06.160]  people and minorities you're a racist well sorry about that but you know it
[03:39:06.160 --> 03:39:09.360]  happened it cut across the complete no i know i know but that's what they said
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:12.240]  they go hey you don't sure it's racist talking about about it
[03:39:12.240 --> 03:39:15.840]  affects everybody or clinton you know frank in michigan uh or is it larry is
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:18.800]  it larry in michigan yeah he just hung up and i was going to go back to him but
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:22.080]  what does he do then how does he get a house well the thing is is that you know
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:25.440]  when i looked for my house i basically went through and i used the merse system
[03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:28.800]  and i looked up all the addresses to see if merse was involved if it was i moved
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:34.080]  on unfortunately merse is affecting over 70 million pieces of property in america
[03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:37.520]  that's 60 percent of all that so you don't go with a merse piece of property
[03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:41.120]  yeah you really try to find something i mean i really encourage uh like i did
[03:39:41.120 --> 03:39:44.800]  the last time before i bought a house i actually bought three-quarter acre put
[03:39:44.800 --> 03:39:50.720]  a house on it paid cash done no no it was clean title if somebody was going to
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:54.480]  foreclose on me there would have to be some sort of history there unless
[03:39:54.480 --> 03:39:57.920]  somebody like what happened in Williamson county that poor fella who had
[03:39:57.920 --> 03:40:00.960]  two houses and sold one and they used the wrong legal description
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:04.720]  that's on the trustee they have errors and omissions insurance so do the title
[03:40:04.720 --> 03:40:09.200]  companies guess who writes underwrites most of the eno g e capital corporation
[03:40:09.200 --> 03:40:12.560]  so we have mega corporations ensuring mega corporations
[03:40:12.560 --> 03:40:16.320]  and so in order to get around this when you go to closing look at where it says
[03:40:16.320 --> 03:40:20.960]  on your title policy under schedule b of your owner's policy we cannot ensure
[03:40:20.960 --> 03:40:25.600]  property uh or ensure a claim if it's not recorded in the land records well
[03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:28.720]  if it's not in the land records we don't have to ensure it which means
[03:40:28.720 --> 03:40:32.640]  you get to pay the legal fees all right let's go to jt coyote
[03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:37.440]  out in uh out in colorado you're on the air go ahead
[03:40:37.440 --> 03:40:44.160]  hey guys um i've been uh fighting the banks now for about five years
[03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:51.280]  uh it seems like every time uh we we get them to back down then a new mortgage
[03:40:51.280 --> 03:40:56.320]  or mortgage company will come in and they start the proceeding over again
[03:40:56.320 --> 03:41:01.120]  i uh pulled up a title search on the property
[03:41:01.120 --> 03:41:05.600]  and uh uh from from the county from the county clerk
[03:41:05.600 --> 03:41:09.120]  and it's loaded with mers clear back to the first
[03:41:09.120 --> 03:41:14.880]  the very first loan we got so uh we've we've been holding them off
[03:41:14.880 --> 03:41:18.800]  uh by asking them basically to hold
[03:41:18.800 --> 03:41:24.240]  uh show us some show us a note show us that you own it and then we'll pay you
[03:41:24.240 --> 03:41:28.480]  yeah well that's another angle is use their fraud a lot of people do this to
[03:41:28.480 --> 03:41:31.600]  stay in the house without paying to get some of your money back is that what
[03:41:31.600 --> 03:41:34.320]  you're doing well that's what we're attempting to do
[03:41:34.320 --> 03:41:37.840]  because the amount of as as the the the loan
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:42.240]  matured you know as each payment it would get higher and higher and higher
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:46.400]  until there was a point where you know we there was no way we could make enough
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:53.600]  money to pay the monthly payment and then uh one of us lost our job
[03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:57.120]  and boom we were in foreclosure and i remember you write friend full awards
[03:41:57.120 --> 03:42:00.320]  dot com sometimes and you're well-known pro gun guy you even
[03:42:00.320 --> 03:42:02.880]  got swat teamed when you were showing the house
[03:42:02.880 --> 03:42:07.360]  was it four or five years ago uh the realtors saw the reloading equipment in
[03:42:07.360 --> 03:42:10.720]  the basement and and and and and and now the
[03:42:10.720 --> 03:42:14.560]  seattle mayor is saying if you see a gun call the police
[03:42:14.560 --> 03:42:18.240]  even if it's in somebody's house seattle mayor to launch gunfree zone
[03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:22.320]  program for private businesses and other areas as well
[03:42:22.320 --> 03:42:26.400]  uh so i mean i'm just a side issue just what a police state this country is but
[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:29.360]  well what's your question specifically for our guests
[03:42:29.360 --> 03:42:33.920]  dav creger what i would like like for david to
[03:42:33.920 --> 03:42:40.560]  address is how one can clear the mers from the title what is there
[03:42:40.560 --> 03:42:48.160]  anyway uh including litigation to um to let's get his
[03:42:48.160 --> 03:42:51.520]  sure sure let's get his answer on that thank you jt go ahead well here's the
[03:42:51.520 --> 03:42:54.880]  big thing uh jt you've got a lot of mers mortgages you just
[03:42:54.880 --> 03:42:57.360]  said you went to the land records and you pulled all this stuff up
[03:42:57.360 --> 03:43:00.560]  and you see mers in there that means each time you took out a mers loan
[03:43:00.560 --> 03:43:04.240]  multiple intervening assignees bought and sold your loan on wall street over
[03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:07.200]  and over and over again so when that happened uh
[03:43:07.200 --> 03:43:10.960]  now you have all these specific chances for unknown people
[03:43:10.960 --> 03:43:14.480]  unknown parties down the road to come back and foreclose even after the fact
[03:43:14.480 --> 03:43:17.840]  let's say that you decide to sell your house you couldn't sell it with all
[03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:21.680]  those mortgages there because one if you know you can't convey clear
[03:43:21.680 --> 03:43:24.720]  title and there's even conditions in your title policy
[03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:28.560]  that say if you know something to be an error and you don't tell the title
[03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:32.160]  company about it they don't have to cover you so it's fraud
[03:43:32.160 --> 03:43:35.280]  all the time when most mortgages have this in it people are selling houses it
[03:43:35.280 --> 03:43:38.800]  makes you wonder why we even have title policies in the first place if the
[03:43:38.800 --> 03:43:42.240]  title companies aren't going to ensure now it's turning out to be one of these
[03:43:42.240 --> 03:43:44.400]  games where the title company is looking for every
[03:43:44.400 --> 03:43:50.000]  reason why not to pay but yet you cough up $700 for an owner's policy at
[03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:53.120]  closing but to answer your question jt you're looking at
[03:43:53.120 --> 03:43:57.120]  at basically quieting title there's your litigation but the problem with quiet
[03:43:57.120 --> 03:44:01.360]  title is you know even to convey here's an argument for you if i go into court
[03:44:01.360 --> 03:44:04.480]  and i'm standing in front of a judge and i say your honor look at it this way
[03:44:04.480 --> 03:44:07.680]  i've got a situation here where i've got mers all over my mortgage
[03:44:07.680 --> 03:44:10.960]  and i think i believe that there are unknown intervening assinies that might
[03:44:10.960 --> 03:44:14.240]  claim an interest if i sell this property in order to
[03:44:14.240 --> 03:44:20.240]  help the lender mitigate his damage i'm fine and i can't do that i can't
[03:44:20.240 --> 03:44:23.600]  even sell my house because the title's clouded but yet you're going to give
[03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:25.920]  this to the bank judge and they're going to turn around
[03:44:25.920 --> 03:44:29.520]  and sell it to some other sucker of the investor or homeowner
[03:44:29.520 --> 03:44:33.360]  that that's going to come in and literally inherit all your problems
[03:44:33.360 --> 03:44:36.800]  when you convey and that's their master plan with too big to fail
[03:44:36.800 --> 03:44:40.720]  with everything they get you to invest in the fraud and now you don't want to
[03:44:40.720 --> 03:44:43.840]  end it because everything's connected to it right and then they have a crisis
[03:44:43.840 --> 03:44:46.720]  where that collapses and they get more power
[03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:50.960]  promising to fix it and then that collapses this is how this is their plan
[03:44:50.960 --> 03:44:54.720]  well the problem is here the judiciary the court system we've gotten America
[03:44:54.720 --> 03:45:00.160]  hasn't seen anything yet it's about to get jammed up and jelly tight
[03:45:00.160 --> 03:45:03.920]  well all i can say is folks do what they say and hand over your house the foreign
[03:45:03.920 --> 03:45:07.440]  banks or your racist i agree with msnbc
[03:45:07.440 --> 03:45:10.800]  you're like what does this have to do with racism i don't know but we're all
[03:45:10.800 --> 03:45:16.160]  racist uh let's talk to uh vinson in washington you're on
[03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:19.440]  the air go ahead how's it going alex
[03:45:19.440 --> 03:45:25.280]  good sir welcome job first time caller uh official one-year listener

[03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:34.480]  my question is uh you're back in the you know the middle
[03:45:34.480 --> 03:45:37.920]  eight nineties when housing started growing crazy
[03:45:37.920 --> 03:45:42.720]  and people were getting these these these zero interest loans and
[03:45:42.720 --> 03:45:46.160]  you know zero job loans and i was scratching my head back then and then
[03:45:46.160 --> 03:45:50.000]  we had this big housing boat now what you're seeing on tv is all these
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:54.240]  reverse mortgages and i think they're trying to attack the older people that
[03:45:54.240 --> 03:45:59.040]  actually paid off home i want to know what was your guys's thoughts on reverse
[03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:01.520]  mortgages thank you sure thank you sir that's a good question
[03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:05.520]  dem krigger here are our clouded titles expert you know it's amazing if you
[03:46:05.520 --> 03:46:09.360]  ever study the harry dent and the dent method he he can gauge over 36 year
[03:46:09.360 --> 03:46:12.240]  period how the economy shapes itself well
[03:46:12.240 --> 03:46:15.760]  this thing kind of threw a monkey wrench this this whole mortgage debacle
[03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:20.000]  through a monkey wrench in the thing so you see all the middle class
[03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:23.280]  right now the baby boomers at age average age of 42
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:26.000]  buying homes and getting into the into the situation now
[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:29.360]  with what vinson's talking about and and they're getting these loans
[03:46:29.360 --> 03:46:33.360]  that are ninja loans no income no job no assets liar loans where it's stated
[03:46:33.360 --> 03:46:36.320]  income just tell us how much you make we'll tell you what you only make 10
[03:46:36.320 --> 03:46:39.520]  thousand a year let's add a zero to the back end now you make 100 000 we can
[03:46:39.520 --> 03:46:42.320]  get you alone country-wide you know bank officials
[03:46:42.320 --> 03:46:45.680]  rumored to say hey if you can fog up a mirror we'll give you a loan
[03:46:45.680 --> 03:46:48.480]  so that here they're attacking the middle class by the time they get to the
[03:46:48.480 --> 03:46:52.400]  baby boomer see they got to have another way to take care of the the third of the
[03:46:52.400 --> 03:46:56.080]  population now that's over 65 that's taxing the health
[03:46:56.080 --> 03:47:00.000]  industry and so what they've got to do is bring death panels in yeah and that's
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:02.320]  and that's well now we have to have reverse mortgages
[03:47:02.320 --> 03:47:05.520]  because now they want to attack the state and take all the equity whatever
[03:47:05.520 --> 03:47:08.640]  equity you have and they'll bleed that out using reverse mortgage
[03:47:08.640 --> 03:47:11.280]  i don't like them i wouldn't recommend them
[03:47:11.280 --> 03:47:15.200]  a lot about these balloon mortgages these those adjustable rates and
[03:47:15.200 --> 03:47:19.360]  all the rest of it so those are insane alex i don't know why anybody would take
[03:47:19.360 --> 03:47:23.280]  one of those i have clients calling me or want to be clients calling me
[03:47:23.280 --> 03:47:28.480]  and they said well we found out in 2009 that we've signed an interest only
[03:47:28.480 --> 03:47:30.800]  mortgage and i went wait a minute you're in wisconsin
[03:47:30.800 --> 03:47:35.120]  that's a deficiency state oh my god you have that omg moment well
[03:47:35.120 --> 03:47:38.480]  realize that what they've signed basically is rent
[03:47:38.480 --> 03:47:41.680]  with a penalty at the end a penalty that they will go to court
[03:47:41.680 --> 03:47:45.600]  and take everything you own until it's all fully collected
[03:47:45.600 --> 03:47:49.280]  once they've sold your house because i mean you literally have no equity
[03:47:49.280 --> 03:47:53.200]  this couple took all their 401k threw it all into their late payments to bring
[03:47:53.200 --> 03:47:57.200]  it up to speed and still got behind because he was on unemployment
[03:47:57.200 --> 03:48:00.800]  so this family is making literally they got two thousand yeah i'm in a certain
[03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:04.240]  point it's a sad story no i mean these globalists all declare bankruptcy and
[03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:07.280]  walk away and they always say that's immoral to declare bankruptcy
[03:48:07.280 --> 03:48:09.920]  but when the whole system's rigged against you i'm not going to give people
[03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:13.440]  individual advice but just just walk away declare bankruptcy
[03:48:13.440 --> 03:48:16.400]  don't pay any of it it's all a fraud anyways that's why i put section three
[03:48:16.400 --> 03:48:19.200]  strategic default in the book because you got to know what your options are
[03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:22.000]  and that's where you'll find them in section three of the book absolutely
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:25.120]  because they're just going to skin you up one side and down the other i mean
[03:48:25.120 --> 03:48:28.160]  it's like i mean it's unbelievable
[03:48:28.160 --> 03:48:32.320]  because they just use us like schmucks if we sit there and quote do the right
[03:48:32.320 --> 03:48:34.800]  thing and they're fraud i mean we're hard working honest
[03:48:34.800 --> 03:48:38.400]  americans we want to do the right thing but it doesn't matter you pay them
[03:48:38.400 --> 03:48:41.200]  everything you got and they still cheat you exactly and that's a problem
[03:48:41.200 --> 03:48:43.840]  especially when you're dealing in issues like dual track and you've got the
[03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:46.400]  megabanks who played in more of these derivatives
[03:48:46.400 --> 03:48:50.480]  than the little guys did man i sure wish we could just arrest all these bankers
[03:48:50.480 --> 03:48:53.200]  i wish we could too but i think we're gonna have to change presidents to get
[03:48:53.200 --> 03:48:56.480]  that done yeah what's your take on obama and all
[03:48:56.480 --> 03:49:00.800]  this this guy is done relatively little if anything
[03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:05.920]  to fix this program hamp is a joke a total joke in my book in fact i i put
[03:49:05.920 --> 03:49:09.680]  it in the book i don't rely on hamp very few people it was just a stalling
[03:49:09.680 --> 03:49:12.480]  stalling technique well i mean this is it when you go to get a
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:15.760]  loan mod and you think you're eligible for hamp i mean you need to run the
[03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:18.240]  numbers first so it's worse it's more false hope
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:21.440]  that's exactly it they want to give you hope they want to keep you hanging on
[03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:25.840]  but what really is bothering me is one of my clients uh from a week ago
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:29.280]  said we got a letter and i actually saw the letter and the bank actually told
[03:49:29.280 --> 03:49:34.000]  him you haven't been late enough on your payments for us to do a loan mod
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:37.920]  i'm going see how late you need to be 90 days i want to jack it up no it's 90
[03:49:37.920 --> 03:49:40.320]  days what happens if there's default insurance
[03:49:40.320 --> 03:49:44.080]  90 days elapses the bank goes to the insurance carrier and says hey
[03:49:44.080 --> 03:49:47.680]  they're in default spend over 90 days pay up the bank has made made whole and
[03:49:47.680 --> 03:49:52.080]  they're still coming after your property unbelievable and then they go cash in
[03:49:52.080 --> 03:49:55.840]  they've got all these derivatives and fraud on fraud on fraud
[03:49:55.840 --> 03:50:00.160]  the cds is it's an insurance policy it's a side bet
[03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:03.360]  guess what happens you know like detroit they're in chapter nine
[03:50:03.360 --> 03:50:06.400]  why are they in chapter nine because they bought these bonds
[03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:09.840]  a lot of these municipalities there's at least 20 that were listed just on yahoo
