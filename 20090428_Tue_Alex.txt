[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:39.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.000]  It is Tuesday, the 28th day of April, 2009. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  We have medical doctor Sherry Tinpenny joining us. She just got back to the United States from Mexico,
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  basically forced out of the country in Monterey, in the city of Monterey, where she was staying at a medical conference.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  She's also had a practice down in Mexico. She'll be reporting to us on some of the things she witnessed
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  traveling through Mexico when she left and her medical view of what's happening and folding.
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  Is it all hype or is there something real? Is there a serious threat behind all of this?
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  I want to hear from you, the listeners, specifically with different angles and different news items
[01:30.000 --> 01:42.000]  and what you think is really going on specifically on this issue of the bird pig human flu scare.
[01:42.000 --> 01:55.000]  The new Mongol flu, the new designer flu that every doctor and scientist and virologist we talk to in the articles I read,
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  even CNN's got experts on saying we got to see if this was made in the laboratory because it has every telltale sign of that
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.000]  and that's why governments and scientists clearly at certain levels, at legitimate levels,
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  and researchers and others are so concerned about this is because it is such a new flu.
[02:12.000 --> 02:20.000]  I mean every new flu, every new mutation is new, but this is entirely whole cloth new.
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  It's originating in the evidence shows out of Mexico.
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  All flues, for whatever reason, originate in the east and travel to the west.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  That is a scientific historical fact. Why is this originating in Mexico?
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  Now when I say all, all the major yearly flues, there have been a few that haven't,
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  and those have been trips being injected in biological tests at military bases in 1918 and 1976 in the United States
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  and that's come out on record.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  So is it going to mutate into something deadly? Have they done the tests in laboratories and they know that?
[02:57.000 --> 03:09.000]  Is this a setup? Baxter Pharmaceutical involved with shipping samples to 18 different countries in Europe
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  to have it mixed with vaccines and that gets covered up.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  People are in bird flu trial tests in Europe.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  They're told it's a regular flu vaccine. They're paid to take it. They die.
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  All of this is extremely serious because we have to realize the mindset of the global elite,
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  the mindset of the eugenicists running the planet, that they've done so many chemical, biological,
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  and radiological tests on the people before and that we know that killing the majority of the population
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  is near and dear to their hearts, that we have to take all of these threats, especially when they're hyping it,
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  seriously, in airports all over the world, including the United States, Mexico, Europe,
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  with these infrared cameras looking for people that are, you know, have outward signs of fever,
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  school shutdown all over Mexico. All schools in Mexico are shut down.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  That country coming to a complete standstill. Tourism shut down.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  People don't fly down there. They're telling Americans and Europeans and Canadians
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  and other Latin Americans get out, which is actually the best way to spread it.
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  And they keep saying to the media, it's a worst strain, but they say it looks the same in Mexico.
[04:18.000 --> 04:23.000]  Is it race specific, or is it that Mexican population has run down? I'm getting emails,
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  calls from doctors, blurbs, and Mexican news that in coastal towns, small towns, clean towns
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  that don't have all the dioxins and poisons, people are dying in hospitals.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  Well, one thing's for sure, this will all become clearer in the hours and days and weeks to come.
[04:40.000 --> 04:49.000]  Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst. 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  Call us. Let us know what you know. On the other side, your calls and a bunch of gas straight ahead.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.000]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the InfoWars.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  You are a rebel. Admit it. You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.000]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost. Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane
[05:11.000 --> 05:17.000]  with only you in the car. Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count your real friends on one hand.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  Well, join the club. Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  Now, Alex Jones is working to save that very country. So go ahead, be a rebel.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  Put in a food supply from eFoodsDirect.com. Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  eFoodsDirect.com. If you're going to pick something to stand for, be sure you have enough food to keep on standing.
[05:51.000 --> 05:59.000]  800-409-5633. eFoodsDirect.com. That's 800-409-5633.
[05:59.000 --> 06:06.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[06:12.000 --> 06:19.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[06:23.000 --> 06:35.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[06:40.000 --> 06:47.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[07:08.000 --> 07:18.000]  but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[07:34.000 --> 07:42.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[07:42.000 --> 07:53.000]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305. That's 866-295-5305 or order online hbextract.com.

[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  Good work.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  We got Dr. Rebecca Carly coming up. Medical doctor in the last hour today.
[08:32.000 --> 08:43.000]  Dr. Beagle bumps in 30 minutes in the second hour and we do have fresh out of Mexico coming up in about 25 minutes.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny will be joining us coming up.
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  Now, I have all the latest news, all the latest developments here.
[08:52.000 --> 09:00.000]  I'm just going to mention some of this and then we'll just go directly to your calls because I want to give people a lot of time today on air to bring up different items
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.000]  that they've seen, that they've noticed, kind of put our collective minds together.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  But particularly people who have family in Mexico who are in Mexico, the epicenter of this,
[09:08.000 --> 09:15.000]  we, since Saturday, have gotten confirmation after confirmation after confirmation and confirmation of the BBC
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  as well of the death rates being much higher than what the media is saying.
[09:21.000 --> 09:30.000]  And that's the key is that you have this double speaker talking out of both sides of their mouths by the Mexican government, the U.S. government,
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  European governments, the World Health Organization, the United Nations.
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  On one side, the White House says we're declaring an emergency, a health emergency that we haven't done in decades.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  But this is just a formality. It's no big deal.
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  And you have the Mexican government saying everybody who's a foreigner, get out, we're shutting down all the shops, the stores,
[09:53.000 --> 10:02.000]  the roads, basically, the cities, the schools, events, museums, and the lockdowns intensifying.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  We're quarantining people and we get the reports from hospitals all over the country, people vomiting, collapsing, people laying in the hallways,
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  laying in the bathrooms, people dying in small towns.
[10:13.000 --> 10:23.000]  And then this is anecdotal evidence, but if it continues to pop up, you connect the dots, it makes a clear picture.
[10:23.000 --> 10:32.000]  Paul was in San Antonio this weekend visiting his folks 60 miles south of us with his wife and children,
[10:32.000 --> 10:40.000]  and his wife and his daughter are very, very sick with flu-like symptoms yesterday and today.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  We're getting reports from We Are Change members, like Luke Redaskill of the country, that they have a lot of friends that are sick.
[10:47.000 --> 10:57.000]  One of the We Are Change members, what Manny, I talked to him last night, and he knows one of the girls who's been quarantined,
[10:57.000 --> 11:04.000]  she's in the hospital, and they're saying it was 80 people sick and going to the hospital out of that private school
[11:04.000 --> 11:12.000]  where we saw some of the first cases back on Saturday in the United States confirmed cases.
[11:12.000 --> 11:21.000]  So either this is all complete total hype, and governments and vaccine makers and drug makers,
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  like the makers of Tamiflu, are just hyping this to get more control, get more power, blot out the news cycle of Obama protecting Bush on torture,
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  Obama continuing the wars, that was all coming to a head.
[11:32.000 --> 11:41.000]  The bankers stealing $12.8 trillion and counting Mexico being on the verge of revolution.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  Obama's approval ratings in freefall, the European Union agenda is stalling.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  I mean, governments need these distractions from time to time, and they're certainly capitalizing on it regardless.
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  Or do they know something they're not telling the public?
[11:55.000 --> 12:07.000]  Because their actions say they think this is the most deadly thing since the black plague, or since the swine flu epidemic,
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 that killed at least 40 million people.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  I mean, they're acting like this is the end of the world.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  But they did that too in 1976 and said everybody in America has to be vaccinated in the United States,
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  and a bunch of people died from the vaccine, nobody died from the supposed bird flu or swine flu that, excuse me,
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  that popped up on a U.S. military base, as it did in 1918.
[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  So time will tell with all of this.
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.000]  Here's some of the headlines right now at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[12:41.000 --> 12:52.000]  Time Magazine preps Americans for mandatory vaccinations, says public should trust government when it institutes draconian measures to deal with pandemic.
[12:52.000 --> 13:03.000]  So we're seeing them engage in a preparatory program, which is not soothing news.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  It does not calm the nerves.
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.000]  Weaponizing deadly viruses, historical precedents, infowars.com from Curt Nemo, how the CIA admits they weaponized cancer,
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.000]  weaponized a bunch of other types of viruses.
[13:15.000 --> 13:16.000]  We'll log over that.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  San Francisco Chronicle Articles and others that he cites.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  CDC to mix avian human flu viruses and pandemic study.
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  This is out of the big medical site, sidrep.umn.edu, big educational news site, university site.
[13:34.000 --> 13:45.000]  And this is back from January 14, 2004, five years ago, where they mixed and made hybrid superfluous and then mailed it all over the world, by the way.
[13:45.000 --> 13:46.000]  Here's another one.
[13:46.000 --> 13:56.000]  Biological weapons date back to ancient Chinese for folks that are having trouble understanding why governments could engage in bioweapons attacks,
[13:56.000 --> 14:04.000]  why we see that as a possibility, though a horrible one, we're hoping that's not the case, is that the Greeks did it.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  The Canaanites did it.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  The Hittites did it.
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  The Huns did it.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  The Mongols did it.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  The Chinese did it.
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  The British did it in the Americas.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  And then the U.S. Army did it in the 1860s and 70s.
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.000]  So I want to go over that later in the show and we have time.
[14:21.000 --> 14:34.000]  Also, there's a lot of other important news like U.S. Regulatory Czar nominee wants a net fairness doctrine openly states that he plans to restrict free speech on the Internet
[14:34.000 --> 14:47.000]  and make you post opposing views and links in any stories by law and have a 24-hour cooling off period before you can send emails to anybody criticizing the government or anybody else.
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  Obama pushing treaty to ban reloading, this is really happening, ban reloading period.
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  They're going to call that explosives manufacturing and an act of terrorism.
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  Larry Pratt put out a Governors of America alert on this.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  I've read the treaty.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  It's actually in there.
[15:02.000 --> 15:15.000]  Notice how they tried to ban the military selling brass from spent rounds to the big federal ammo and Georgia ammo and the rest of it.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  This is definitely one of the ways they're going after our second amendments.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  We'll get into that.
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  That's just some of what I've got here in the stacks today.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  But please, so I have a chance to get everybody, make your point.
[15:29.000 --> 15:30.000]  We're going to move on quickly.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Stephen Chicago, go ahead.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  Yes, Alex.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  I know you haven't been reading at Der Spiegel, but it's this swine flu container explodes on train in Switzerland.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  You saw that, didn't you?
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  No, I don't know. Listen, I'm talking to you right now, Steve.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  You asked me a question.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  I paused for about half a second and then so just hold on.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  No, I didn't see that.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Will you give me the headline please?
[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  Okay, it's swine flu container explodes on train.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  Evidently, that's that avian virus.
[16:03.000 --> 16:11.000]  They say it's a attenuated form and they had it packed in dry ice and I guess the carbon dioxide built up and the thing exploded.
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  It's exposing 60 passengers.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  It was just a regular passenger.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  Yeah, that would only happen.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  That would only happen if it was actually a live virus.
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  They wouldn't have it packed in ice and that is huge news.
[16:25.000 --> 16:36.000]  Guys, will you Google right now swine flu explodes on train Der Spiegel or the most respected publications in the world in Germany, especially if that's the case.
[16:36.000 --> 16:44.000]  This is clearly some type of bio weapon attack. I mean, because this isn't just going to happen on accident during all of this going on.
[16:44.000 --> 16:57.000]  Plus, you have Baxter chosen by the UN, the World Health Organization to quote make the vaccine for this when they're tied into Europe, shipping a live weaponized bird flu.
[16:57.000 --> 17:10.000]  All printed for me. Thanks. Shipping that all over Europe and then mislabeling it by design. The doctors are saying there's no way that could have happened to have it then mixed with regular vaccine.
[17:10.000 --> 17:17.000]  And then you have companies unnamed by the media, but it's it's in the major news telling homeless people.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  I'll keep repeating this. This is a key pieces of the evidence.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  We're trying to put together what this means here.
[17:22.000 --> 17:28.000]  We have globalists at stage 9 11 globalists that radiate foster children and feed them pesticides and, you know, kill them.
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  And that's the New York Daily News a few years ago and no one stops them.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  So remember who these psychopaths are. And sir, I wasn't trying to be rude to you, Steve.
[17:35.000 --> 17:38.000]  I was really thinking when you said that a lot of things were connecting.
[17:38.000 --> 17:45.000]  And so it was very upsetting swine flu container explodes on train when a container holding swine flu explodes on Swiss train on Monday.
[17:45.000 --> 17:53.000]  It could have led to a nightmare scenario. Luckily, the virus was not the mutated swine flu that has killed around 150 people in Mexico.
[17:53.000 --> 17:55.000]  I mean, what's going on? They just got this flu everywhere, shipping around.
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  And that was already spread to parts of Europe.
[17:57.000 --> 18:03.000]  Now, see when Baxter first mixed the weaponized bird flu in with vaccines and they won't say if it was shipped out or not.
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  First, they said it was harmless turned out it was a lie.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  So I don't believe for a minute that this is going on because normally it is a lie.
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  Go ahead, Steve. What's your point on this?
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  Well, then there was one other article that was in the target site.
[18:17.000 --> 18:25.000]  It said that the world discoverer of the original avian flu virus is an Albert Osterhaus, 60.
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  He works in the Rotterdam Erasmus University.
[18:29.000 --> 18:39.000]  And according to this interview with him, he discovered in 1997 the H5N1 bird virus and helped him to discover his SARS.
[18:39.000 --> 18:49.000]  But he said that in his opinion, and this is one of the guys that's a world authority, not an American NIH or anything to do with America.
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  But he says that in his opinion that it's a mixture of human swine and still unknown virus.
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  He's not declaring it a bird.
[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  Yeah, so two of the elements he says fits any system.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  Is he being given access to the genome of the virus?
[19:09.000 --> 19:16.000]  Then I don't know, but it would be good to get him on a program because, as I say, his name is Albert Osterhaus.
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  O-S-T-E-R-H-A-U-S.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  Albert Osterhaus. Let's get him, Rob. My producer's listening.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  Albert Osterhaus and what university is he at?
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.000]  Erasmus E-R-A-S-M-U-S University.
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  And that's in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
[19:34.000 --> 19:43.000]  Okay, guys, write this down. Rotterdam, Netherlands. Albert Osterhaus. How do you spell it?
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  O-S-T-E-R-H-A-U-S.
[19:47.000 --> 19:55.000]  H-A-U-S. Rotterdam, Netherlands. Thank you so much. We'll look into that right now. Thank you. More calls straight ahead.
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  That's why we like taking these calls. They bring up incredible points that we miss.
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse. Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth

[21:00.000 --> 21:06.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[21:06.000 --> 21:14.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[21:25.000 --> 21:36.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[21:40.000 --> 21:47.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[24:00.000 --> 24:14.000]  We're watching every move the New World Order makes. There are a bunch of bio weapons loving eugenicists openly calling for the extermination of the majority of the world population.
[24:14.000 --> 24:24.000]  The UN, the Club of Rome, the CFR, the majority of world leaders, the Royal Family of England.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  Maybe fools not to say this could be staged. The virus is clearly an engineered bio weapon.
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  I'm going to play a CNN clip discussing that coming up in the next segment.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  And we're taking your phone calls right now.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  Let's talk to George in Oklahoma. George, you're on the air. Welcome.
[24:45.000 --> 24:54.000]  Alejandro, I'm not going to waste your time. I'm going to keep this under a minute. I'm not going to waste your time by saying hello, how are you, or what a great guy you are.
[24:54.000 --> 25:02.000]  But the first time I heard about this bird flu, I thought about all those millions of coffins strategically located all around the United States.
[25:02.000 --> 25:11.000]  And the last thing I'm going to say is I dreamed that this was a New World operation 10 days ago. And I wrote three of my friends about it.
[25:11.000 --> 25:15.000]  So I'm the guy that met you when you were 16 years old. Take it easy.
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  All right, buddy. Good to hear from you, George in Oklahoma.
[25:19.000 --> 25:28.000]  Yeah, it is, it is really amazing to see all of this going on.
[25:28.000 --> 25:35.000]  And the way they're hyping it, the governments are certainly using this to get all the other big issues.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  The bankers taking over Obama's supporting torture, all of those big stories that were coming to a head.
[25:41.000 --> 25:48.000]  Now that's on the back burner. People are just worried about trying to survive.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Texas. Robert, you're on the air.
[25:52.000 --> 26:02.000]  All right. Thanks Alex for taking my call. I'm going to try to blast through this real quick and I have some information regarding Steve Quill's orange alert that I've seen with my own two eyes.
[26:02.000 --> 26:13.000]  I think this operation is a complete smoke and mirrors to keep the eyes off of the real crisis, which is the economy.
[26:13.000 --> 26:27.000]  Lindsay Williams came on Dr. Monteith on the afternoon of Friday the 17th of April here and he said that General Motors was going to shut down 2,000 dealerships.
[26:27.000 --> 26:40.000]  He said that General Growth Properties, which is the second largest real estate holder in the United States, followed for Chapter 11.
[26:40.000 --> 26:51.000]  And let's see here. I think this is just a big smoke and mirrors to take the attention away from that.
[26:51.000 --> 27:08.000]  He was saying that the tax receipts were down $54 billion in the last month. The Federal Reserve monetized $23.5 billion in the last week from that week.
[27:08.000 --> 27:22.000]  It's more than that, sir. I mean, they are spending over a trillion and a half dollars a month, Obama, in 105 days in office. He'd already eclipsed this two weeks ago, but now it's even worse.
[27:22.000 --> 27:40.000]  In the 90-something days in the office or less, he had already spent more money than all presidents, all governments in the United States history before him, and at this rate, he will spend more money by...
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.000]  I saw this article in the Wall Street Journal a week ago, by later this year. I think it's, what, six, seven months from now at the end of the year?
[27:47.000 --> 27:59.000]  More money than all governments have spent in the last 200-plus years combined. So this is... And then, meanwhile, he's saying he's going to balance the budget and cut the deficit in half by 2010.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.000]  I mean, what an asinine lie. But again, his Kool-Aid drinkers just love it. So, yes, we are in just amazing times right now.
[28:09.000 --> 28:20.000]  And notice how this bird slash swine slash human superflu out of season, starting on the opposite side of the planet from where it always starts, just comes out of nowhere.
[28:20.000 --> 28:30.000]  And then you've got flu blowing up on trains in Switzerland. I mean, this is getting... This is getting to be really crazy.
[28:30.000 --> 28:40.000]  Yeah. Okay, let's see. I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous. I'm never calling...
[28:40.000 --> 28:47.000]  It's okay. Finish your point. We're going to jump to the next person. I'm going to let you go. I'm going to let you go. Listen, folks, when you get on here, just be ready with your points, all right?
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.000]  And have a little bit of respect for the show and a little bit of respect for yourself, okay? Let's go ahead. And who's up next here?
[28:54.000 --> 29:03.000]  Robert in California, go ahead. Hi, Alex. I wanted to comment and tell you what's going on in San Diego. We had a case recently.
[29:03.000 --> 29:16.000]  I don't know if you've caught this on the Internet. A seven-year-old boy over at Christ, the Cornerstone Academy in Miramesa, California has come down with the virus.
[29:16.000 --> 29:26.000]  The county came in and shut down the school. It has over 200 students from pre-kindergarten through sixth grade.
[29:26.000 --> 29:36.000]  And by the way, I caught it on the news yesterday that this week is vaccination week. I didn't know if you were aware of that.
[29:36.000 --> 29:46.000]  Yes, isn't it perfect timing? We're saying it's the law to take vaccines. We're exposing that it's not a law. And right on time to take, stay there. We're going to come back and discuss this.
[29:46.000 --> 29:56.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.000 --> 30:06.000]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses. One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.000]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit shentrition.com.
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  Shentrition is an innovative supplement that stimulates the healing power of the body.

[30:57.000 --> 31:03.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[31:03.000 --> 31:09.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[31:09.000 --> 31:15.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[31:20.000 --> 31:31.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[31:36.000 --> 31:43.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[31:43.000 --> 31:51.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super-high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:51.000 --> 31:55.000]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[31:55.000 --> 32:04.000]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update. GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[32:04.000 --> 32:12.000]  It's called protogrow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and like conditions.
[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[32:15.000 --> 32:23.000]  Protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[32:23.000 --> 32:29.000]  Protogrow works by providing geometric keys, which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[32:29.000 --> 32:35.000]  Protogrow's full-spectrum plant fertility meets fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste, and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[32:38.000 --> 32:42.000]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hygrids, it's now easy.
[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt sheep superfoods should visit the protogrow website at growlikecrazy.com.
[32:47.000 --> 32:56.000]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365.
[32:56.000 --> 33:22.000]  Alright, we are going to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny here in just a moment.
[33:22.000 --> 33:32.000]  Then we have Dr. Deagle popping in for 30 minutes later with his view than other folks coming up later in the show.
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  And we do have callers calling the office from Mexico City saying they can't get through on the Genesis phone lines.
[33:39.000 --> 33:47.000]  So we're going to be during the shower in the next hour calling just individuals in Mexico City via the network so they can get on air and tell us what's going on.
[33:47.000 --> 33:57.000]  In fact, if you're in Mexico City or have reports about what's happening, email robdo, it's just robd at infowars.com.
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.000]  Rob and the initial D at infowars.com. Specifically, are you seeing more people die?
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  Are you seeing more people sick than what the media is saying?
[34:06.000 --> 34:14.000]  Because I have gotten literally hundreds of emails, scores of calls, and then I've seen medical doctors in the BBC from Mexico saying,
[34:14.000 --> 34:22.000]  look, there's a lot more dead and sick than they're saying. Now, believe me, I live in Texas where this stuff is popping up in suburbs of Austin, San Antonio.
[34:22.000 --> 34:31.000]  It's in Dallas, Fort Worth. It's in Waco. It's in Gonzales. It's all over the place. I'm hoping it's just a regular flu.
[34:31.000 --> 34:38.000]  We're going to go to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny who is in, forced out of Mexico yesterday. She was down there, medical doctor.
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.000]  She's now in San Antonio getting ready to, I guess, take a flight back to her home in the U.S. but she also practices in Mexico.
[34:45.000 --> 34:53.000]  But I wanted to finish up with the information. Yes, they've shut down all schools in Mexico and now they're trying to shut down schools in the U.S.
[34:53.000 --> 35:00.000]  if there's even one potential case of this. Robert in California, finish up what you were saying about this particular school in California.
[35:00.000 --> 35:13.000]  Yes, sir. They shut it down. They had nothing on the boy's ethnic origin, nothing on if they had traveled.
[35:13.000 --> 35:25.000]  The school in New York, the kids had traveled to Cancun, Mexico so you can trace the source back where those 20 kids in New York had come in contact.
[35:25.000 --> 35:32.000]  This is very vague. They don't, you know, all we know is the seven-year-old boy, six teachers had come in contact with him.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  There's another case in Coronado. I haven't heard anything about that.
[35:36.000 --> 35:45.000]  Then the news had another one up in the capital in Sacramento where a school had one child that came under infection.
[35:45.000 --> 35:51.000]  And, you know, being so close to the border, I'm like you, you know, here in San Diego, they keep popping up.
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.000]  But so far this is the only school. Are you kidding? I mean, where I live in Austin, Texas, basically is Mexico.
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  Austin is kind of the line where Mexico begins. Listen, I appreciate your call.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  So we continue with more calls because of all the different angles people bring up.
[36:05.000 --> 36:15.000]  Like our first caller, Stephen Chicago, in case Dr. Tenpenny, Sherry Tenpenny isn't aware of this, swine flu container explodes on train.
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  This kind of adds credibility to that caller to the power hours saying that we're all these trucks driving around with it on ice.
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  Well, this confirms it was on ice and then exploded a swine flu.
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.000]  They're saying it was attenuated. What on earth is going on? This is out of their spiegel.
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.000]  Major newspaper and magazine, very respected in Germany, very bizarre.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  Dr. Joining us from San Antonio, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, thank you for coming on.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  Good morning, Alex. Thanks for having me back.
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.000]  You bet. Just recapping, briefly tell folks who you are because you can explain your bio better than I in briefly.
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  And then you were in Mexico and basically forced out, recapped that.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.000]  And then since we talked to you 24 hours ago, your take on this.
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.000]  Sure. My office is in practices in Cleveland, Ohio. It's called Osteomed 2.
[37:03.000 --> 37:08.000]  I've done some consulting work over the last seven months in Mexico. I'm no longer there.
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.000]  But I was in Mexico, in Monterey, Mexico. We arrived there on Saturday, this last Saturday,
[37:14.000 --> 37:18.000]  to attend a medical tourism association conference in Monterey.
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.000]  There were attendees there from literally all over the western hemisphere.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  We met people from Buenos Aires and Paraguay and Uruguay and Nicaragua and all sorts of places to come to this medical conference,
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  which was to start on Monday morning.
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  At Monday morning at 9 o'clock, the officials from what is called Monterey Health Care City,
[37:38.000 --> 37:47.000]  who was in correspondence with the people in Mexico City, came in and announced that the tours of the hospital were going to be canceled.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  And then not only were the tours of the hospitals going to be canceled, the entire seminar,
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  the entire conference, all day Tuesday and all day Wednesday, was to be canceled.
[37:55.000 --> 38:00.000]  And everyone was to immediately find air connections and return home.
[38:00.000 --> 38:07.000]  So people from South America who had paid thousands and thousands of dollars to attend this conference by airfares had to leave.
[38:07.000 --> 38:11.000]  My husband and I had decided that we were going to stay in Monterey through Saturday,
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  because we had fairly complication air arrangements to leave the country.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  But by noon they said no, the people who had not had air connections needed to leave the country.
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.000]  And they had buses available to take people from Monterey across the border into San Antonio.
[38:28.000 --> 38:34.000]  So we ended up, instead of a bus, there were several different steps that had happened.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  Long story short, we ended up in a cab, a very nice little cab actually,
[38:38.000 --> 38:43.000]  who drove us seven hours from Monterey to San Antonio to get us out of the country.
[38:43.000 --> 38:50.000]  We decided not to stay because we thought, well, if they were that serious about paying for a taxi to drive us out of the country,
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  that perhaps the government knew something we didn't know.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  We were afraid if we stayed down there that perhaps we wouldn't be able to get across the border.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  It was a seven-hour cab drive.
[38:59.000 --> 39:05.000]  There were lots of stops along the way with people, white doctor coats, they were stopping us along the highway,
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  and they were coming and making you roll down the window and seeing if anybody was coughing or sneezing.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  And all of the immigration people had unmasked and they all had unclothed.
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  That was my next question.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  Take your time.
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.000]  Describe what this was like getting out of Mexico from the time you leave the hotel.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Well, it was really very interesting because while we were in the hotel,
[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  and this was a nice hotel, it's an intercontinental hotel, everything was just sort of normal.
[39:32.000 --> 39:40.000]  By the time everybody had left, they were washing down the floors, all of the staff, the front desk people,
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.000]  all started wearing masks and gloves, which they hadn't done previously and earlier during the day.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  They were handing out masks to everybody in the hotel for leaving the hotel,
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.000]  and there's no reported cases in Monterey.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  And then as we were driving down the street to get towards the highway,
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  we were seeing all these people walking down the street with masks,
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.000]  and the people that stopped us at the toll booths had unmasked and gloves.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  I mean, everybody is masked up down there in Mexico.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  And you said they were stopping you to see if you were sick.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  I mean, what were they going to do if you were sick?
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  You know, that's a really good question because they had a big bus.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  I mean, it looked like a big motor vehicle bus,
[40:19.000 --> 40:29.000]  and that they had over to the side and it said kind of like the equivalent in Mexico and Spanish of Public Health Department.
[40:29.000 --> 40:35.000]  There was a doctor standing there in a very, you know, starched white coat with the gloves and masks on,
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  and they came over and rolled down the windows and were asking if anybody was sick.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  And so I don't know, maybe they would have taken us off in that bus.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  I mean, I don't really know what they were going to do, but they were stopping every single car
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  as we were driving down.
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.000]  And remember, between Monterey and Laredo, Texas, the border, there is nothing out there.
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  I mean, it's just desert. It's like driving across West Texas.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  And they told you get out yesterday on plane or you have to get out by bus.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  I guess you couldn't get out on planes. You had to do bus.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  Yeah, we couldn't. We just because of the complexity of our air arrangements,
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  we really couldn't get out by plane.
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  But they were real serious about having everybody leave hotel.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  And the last, when we were sitting in the hotel waiting for the cab driver to come on,
[41:20.000 --> 41:26.000]  there was a news report saying that effectively all of tourism in Mexico has been shut down.
[41:26.000 --> 41:32.000]  And they were showing hotels that were basically empty and beaches that were basically empty.
[41:32.000 --> 41:33.000]  So it's one more step.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  Over 150 something deaths.
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  I mean, this really doesn't make sense unless they're covering up what's really happening.
[41:41.000 --> 41:46.000]  Well, it could be or it's just one more step and effectively destroying the Mexican economy.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  That's right. And they're just setting a precedent for martial law and now starting to set that here.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  Okay, so you're driving across Mexico.
[41:53.000 --> 41:59.000]  This is obviously not an enjoyable thing to do, but it did get us a lot of key intel.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  Tell us what else you saw.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  Well, there was, you know, when we even got into some of the smaller towns,
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  I mean, there were people that had, you know, masks and things.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  I don't know how the government had distributed those so quickly.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  But it was just the fact that, you know, we got to the immigration.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  There were several toll booths along the way that we had to stop and pay a toll.
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  You know, it's like a highway toll.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  And all the people there had masks and had gloves on.
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  The immigration people at the border when we came across into the U.S.,
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  I mean, they all had their protective masks.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  And I just think that's so funny.
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  It's like these masks are supposed to protect you when people are taking them on and off.
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  They don't fit tightly around your nose, but boy, they were all bundled up,
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  like trying to make a show that they were either protecting us from them
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  or we were protecting them from them.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  Well, it's all part of the dress-up.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  It's all part of the dress-up for the hysteria, you know,
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  that the situational ethics of, oh, we're in different outfits now.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  We're in a different role now.
[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  And, you know, the armies they're handing them out to you.
[42:59.000 --> 43:00.000]  They love you.
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  They're going to take care of you.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  You know, and then, you know, of course, there's all the schools that are shut down.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  They stopped at a McDonald's to get a cup of coffee.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  And there was the newspaper there saying that all the schools were going to be shut down
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  through, you know, for the next two weeks just across the border.
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  And then what really concerns me, Alex, is this morning on the USA Today paper when it says that,
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  and I'm sure you've already talked about this,
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  that the World Health Organization raises the pandemic alert to phase four.
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  That's right.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  Explain to people, that's the highest level they've done in a very, very long time.
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  Explain to people what this means.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  Well, I'm really concerned.
[43:38.000 --> 43:39.000]  I talk about this.
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.000]  There's a whole section in my book that I wrote in 2005,
[43:43.000 --> 43:44.000]  the Fowl Bird Flu.
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  It's not what you think book that talks about this pandemic preparedness.
[43:48.000 --> 43:52.000]  And there's the next level up, which is phase five,
[43:52.000 --> 43:57.000]  which is being all these rules and regulations are being made in Geneva
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  at the World Health Organization for us globally.
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  And if they go to phase five, and I'm going to read to you what phase five is,
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  and it's documented in my book.
[44:07.000 --> 44:08.000]  It says,
[44:08.000 --> 44:14.000]  assess efficacy and feasibility of prophylaxis for the purpose of attempting to contain outbreaks,
[44:14.000 --> 44:20.000]  which means ring vaccination of family members of persons that were ill.
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.000]  Determine target population for vaccination.
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  If intervention agreed, implement as an emergency measure, then assess impact.
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  Let me stop you.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  I want to go back and start over.
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.000]  Obviously, you're a medical doctor, but just from the other medical doctors I've talked to.
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.000]  If somebody is already sick in a family, there's a good chance others have already been exposed.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  You don't want to vaccinate them, even if the vaccine was safe,
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  which is questionable at best.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  Absolutely.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  You don't want to vaccinate somebody while they've already contracted
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  because that can cause all sorts of mutations.
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  Canada can make the people sicker.
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  Or is that incorrect medically?
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.000]  No, this was the type of procedure that they used with smallpox containment,
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  with the smallpox containment plan.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  In fact, it was what the World Health Organization and the CDC says
[45:08.000 --> 45:12.000]  is what eliminated smallpox was ring vaccination and quarantine,
[45:12.000 --> 45:13.000]  which it's my contention.
[45:13.000 --> 45:16.000]  It was more about the quarantine and not the ring vaccination,
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.000]  but this has never been shown to be useful in containing influenza,
[45:21.000 --> 45:24.000]  but it's part of the plan.
[45:24.000 --> 45:25.000]  Absolutely.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  Now, I want you to start over and read all of that, and we're going to go to a quick call
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  in Mexico City and get your take on that.
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  We're talking to Dr. Sherry.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  Sure, we're talking to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny for those that just joined us.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  I wanted you to just add, before we go back to you, this is key,
[45:38.000 --> 45:42.000]  Kurt Nemo, backing up what you're saying, wrote the story,
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  Flu Pandemic Hype and Other Pretext for World Government,
[45:45.000 --> 45:50.000]  and he goes over the SPP North American Union Security Prosperity Partnership documents
[45:50.000 --> 45:56.000]  from the 2005 Montebello Canada meeting and the 2006 Banff Canada meeting,
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  and lawsuits were filed.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  We got these documents.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  They said they would use a pandemic outbreak of smallpox or flu
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  to bring in their North American Union,
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  and then we have Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN, Secretary General,
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  saying that they're going to use this pandemic to test global governance,
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  and so this is being used.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  And then now what you just said in doctor terms from level five,
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  they're already at level four and only goes to level six, correct?
[46:24.000 --> 46:27.000]  Correct me if I'm wrong, that we're talking about forced inoculations,
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  and now Time Magazine, Newsweek, and others are getting the public ready for forced inoculations.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  Go ahead now, start over.
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  Well, for those of you that have my book and you want to check this out for yourself,
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  it's on page 119.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  It's Pandemic Alert Period Phase Five.
[46:41.000 --> 46:46.000]  It says, Consider Efficacy and Feasibility of Profile Access for the Purpose of Attempting to Contain Outbreaks,
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  which implies ring vaccination.
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  That's number three.
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  Number four, Determine Target Population for Vaccination.
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.000]  If intervention agreed, implement as an emergency measure and assess impact.
[46:59.000 --> 47:05.000]  Number five, Consider Deploying Prototype Pandemic Vaccine if Available.
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  Number six, If Agreements are Already in Place with Manufacturers,
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  Consider Recommending Sensation of Seasonal Vaccine Production
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  and Initiation of Full-Scale Pandemic Vaccine Production.
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.000]  Number seven, Adjust Priority List of Persons to be Vaccinated.
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.000]  Number eight, Plan for Vaccine Distribution and Accelerate Preparations for Mass Vaccination Campaigns,
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  Education, Legal Liability Issues for When Pandemic Vaccine is Available.
[47:32.000 --> 47:39.000]  And we know they've been training the police and military to bring in the vaccine under guard.
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  It's kind of like the cabbage patch doll thing where they act like they're all sold out and everybody's going to have it
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  so it creates a riot wanting it.
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  They do these drills where they practice bringing it in like everybody wants to steal it
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  and everybody wants it to try to trick the police and military into wanting to take it,
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  though the cops and military are waking up.
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  So they play all these psychological games.
[47:57.000 --> 48:03.000]  All these drills with FEMA for mass graves that we've confirmed, the plastic coffins everywhere.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  We're at level four right now, unprecedented.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  Reuters is reporting that that hasn't happened in decades.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  And one more level, level five, goes to forced inoculations.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  Is that what you're saying, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny?
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  I'm saying that that's what the World Health Organization plans is.
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.000]  And the other thing that really concerns me is that will they implement something called a vaccine ID card
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  required for travelers to do business for that something to be government authorized card?
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  No, we've got all the very chip technology and everything that's out there.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  And for people that travel, they've done this before.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  They did this back in the 40s with smallpox.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  And you just went through checkpoints in Mexico checking to see if you were sick.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  That's one step away from the card that you've had the shot and then whatever they're really using
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  to sterilize you or cancer viruses, what they've been caught doing in Africa and Latin America and Asia.
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.000]  They could easily, with the new vaccines they've already produced or what Baxter's done,
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  tied to shipping out this live bird flu.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  I mean, this is insane.
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  Well, we're getting closer every day, aren't we, Alex?
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  I mean, this is something that I know that I've been tracking since 2000.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  And you've been doing it at least that long, if not longer.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  But it's suddenly like this whole plan for whatever reason is coming together as we speak.
[49:20.000 --> 49:26.000]  You know, it's an upsetting me, doctor, you're a highly respected medical doctor, you know, you go on mainstream radio and TV.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  You were kind of calling for calm yesterday and saying, you know, this is probably just a bunch of hype.
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  But boy, they're acting strange.
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  24 hours later, or 23 hours to be technical, you are totally, and it's the same thing.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  I have this bad feeling.
[49:40.000 --> 49:48.000]  I've been saying there's no way they can get their new world order agenda through without some crisis to make everybody stand down to the new bank of the world.
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  The police state, the troops on the streets.
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  You've had all this feverish preparation last year for mass flu pandemics everywhere confirmed.
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  And then so you see all this preparation right before it happens.
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  I hope this is just a beta test by these people, but this could be the balloon going up.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  Well, it could.
[50:05.000 --> 50:13.000]  And if you remember right soon after, I believe it was right after the inauguration when the vice president said, you know, in the first hundred days,
[50:13.000 --> 50:22.000]  maybe the president will really be challenged with something and he sort of said that sort of let it slip when Biden said, you know, that was at a private donor meeting.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  He didn't know it was recorded.
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.000]  Well, maybe this is it.
[50:24.000 --> 50:28.000]  You know, this is an international going to be an international crisis.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  It's going to be across our borders.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  And you know, all of these things popping up everywhere, Alex.
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.000]  I mean, I kept saying, how can this possibly be unless it's been in the water, in the air, in somewhere.
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.000]  There's not enough people to have done, you know, face-to-face contact with this.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  All right.
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  Dr. Sherry Tinpin.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.000]  We're going to give your website out.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  People can learn more when we come back.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  You're going to stay with us another 30 minutes.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  We appreciate that.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  We're going to go to Mexico City and Justin with a report as well.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  Stay with me.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  Springtime.
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[51:08.000 --> 51:14.000]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[51:14.000 --> 51:22.000]  We then add a small amount of pyrithrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[51:25.000 --> 51:32.000]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  So pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[51:36.000 --> 51:46.000]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas, roaches, crickets and more, and save enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[51:56.000 --> 52:03.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[52:03.000 --> 52:11.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[52:11.000 --> 52:17.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[52:22.000 --> 52:32.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  that's fascism.
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government.
[52:37.000 --> 52:44.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[52:44.000 --> 52:52.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[52:56.000 --> 53:02.000]  Spring is here, growing season. The economy is not getting any better.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  Think about it, at this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[53:16.000 --> 53:28.000]  For organicaseed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.

[53:48.000 --> 53:55.000]  That's O-R-G-A-N-I-C-A-C-E-D dot com. Organicaseed.com today.
[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  This is huge breaking news.
[54:05.000 --> 54:17.000]  North Carolina involuntarily isolating suspected swine flu patients.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  States refuse to have old details of cases.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  See, they've had their old police state grids set up, geared up.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  This is being reported by WRAL News.
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.000]  A detailed report is at infowars.net by Steve Watson.
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  And whenever they declare they're at a level three, they're really at a level four.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  When they declare they're at a level four, they're really at a level five.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  That's how governments operate.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  So the governments are operating as if this is the 1918 flu, the killer flu.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  They're acting like this is hell on earth.
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  Well, meanwhile, telling us everything's fine, so we stand down and there's not panic.
[54:54.000 --> 55:01.000]  And notice, I kept saying week after week, the last few months, I said they're going to launch a major stage terror attack,
[55:01.000 --> 55:07.000]  a nuke attack, a new war, or a bird flu of some type, because I could see the hype.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  And I said over and over again the last month, I believe they're going to play the bird flu.
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  And I never make a prediction, except maybe once a year or so.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  And unfortunately, they almost always come through.
[55:18.000 --> 55:27.000]  And now, just like with the false flag attack, though, of the Gulf of Tonkin, the ships were not attacked.
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  They were not fired at, they claimed they had torpedoes and mortars and things shot at them.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  That was a total lie.
[55:34.000 --> 55:42.000]  So you can have false flag terror attacks that aren't real or are just a run-of-the-mill weird flu, and then they hype it up.
[55:42.000 --> 55:48.000]  So let's just hope they're using this as a pretext to grab power and poses saviors and using this as a smoke screen.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  Let's hope it isn't really some weaponized flu they've released.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is with us.
[55:54.000 --> 55:55.000]  She just left Mexico.
[55:55.000 --> 55:56.000]  She was down there witnessing a lot of this.
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  We go to Justin in Mexico City joining us.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  Justin, tell us a little bit about yourself.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  You called in on the show Saturday.
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  I guess you're an American living in Mexico.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  Are you a Mexican?
[56:09.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'm Canadian.
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  You're Canadian?
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000]  I'm an American.
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  Okay, great.
[56:13.000 --> 56:14.000]  But it's all American, period.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Tell us what you're witnessing right now, sir.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  Well, today, Mexico City seems like a ghost town.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  There's hardly any pollution, hardly any movement.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  And it does seem like they're just shutting everything down.
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  They're even talking about shutting down the subway and all public transportation.
[56:31.000 --> 56:38.000]  And there's soldiers at all the toll roads going out, checking people and handing out masks.
[56:38.000 --> 56:44.000]  And there's also a lot of people fleeing the city because they canceled school.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  A lot of people see no reason to stay here and they're leaving.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  I spent about three days at the hospital while my wife was giving birth.
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  And I observed a lot of things.
[56:55.000 --> 57:02.000]  The doctor told me that they had one confirmed death from the flu there and five confirmed cases.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  But he also said that there are 20 deaths due to respiratory illness there, which they don't know,
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  because they don't have the facility to test for it.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  What's the name of the hospital?
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  This is big news.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  Is it a big hospital?
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  What's the name?
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  San Bartolo Hospital.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  It's a public hospital.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  And they'll call it into waters.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  So it's in Juarez?
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  And I'll call Ben.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  How do you spell that?
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.000]  N-A-U-C-A-U-L-T-A-N.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  Okay.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  Boy, we know you're in Mexico City.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  We can hear those roosters.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  I like that sound kind of like a train in the night.
[57:39.000 --> 57:40.000]  Let's bring him.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  I'm going to hold you over, sir.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  I appreciate you getting in contact with the office.
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.000]  And by the way, he did call us.
[57:44.000 --> 57:45.000]  We have called our ID.
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  He is in Mexico City.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  And we've called him back in Mexico City.
[57:48.000 --> 57:53.000]  So we've confirmed that Dr. Tenpenny can use specifically,
[57:53.000 --> 57:54.000]  since you're a medical doctor,
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  ask him key questions about what he saw in this hospital.
[57:57.000 --> 58:00.000]  20 deaths from respiratory.
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.000]  They have a test of them for flu and one death in that hospital
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  alone from flu confirmed.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  I mean, that's what we keep getting from everybody in Mexico.
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  It's much worse than we're being told.
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.000]  Did you actually ask the physicians what they thought
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  the cause of deaths were?
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  I mean, if they only have one confirmed death,
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  but they're calling it other respiratory things,
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  there could be a whole lot of other things in Mexico
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  that people are dying from respiratory wise.
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  That's true.
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  But I did notice that the doctors were very panic.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  They're really stressed out working overtime.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  There's an increase of death and sickness.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  Stay there.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  Back in 70 seconds or the second hour.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:43.000 --> 58:46.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:46.000 --> 58:47.000]  Hello, friends.
[58:47.000 --> 58:48.000]  This is Alex Jones.
[58:48.000 --> 58:51.000]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  We need to be independent.
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  And food and water is the key.
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[58:58.000 --> 58:59.000]  until you have your own bread.
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare,
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  no one is going to take care of your family
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  in the final equation, but you.
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food
[59:11.000 --> 59:14.000]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration,
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  of last year's grocery prices.
[59:18.000 --> 59:21.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list
[59:26.000 --> 59:29.000]  of high quality, freeze dried, dehydrated foods
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  they have to offer.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  Watch the free videos.
[59:31.000 --> 59:32.000]  Look at their online catalog.

[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  Again, 800-409-5633
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  Take action today.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  The first step is getting storable food.
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:51.000 --> 59:55.000]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  Big brother.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  Mainstream media.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  Government cover-ups.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  You want answers?
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  There's no other way to put it.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  I foresaw weaponized food the last two months
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  on air, scored some time saying,
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  I believe that's the card they would play.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Our limited staff working so hard
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  is covering the news, bringing in the last info.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  We don't have time to go back through all the shows
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  and pull those clips out, but somebody should
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  and post it up on YouTube.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  We'll play it here because people need to hear that.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  You know, I'm very careful about what I say,
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  but we had just hundreds and hundreds of indicators
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  of pre-hype movements, covert documents,
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  secret documents we got about governments
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  all over the world preparing for a impending pandemic.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  FEMA drills that were used as covers to get ready.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  FEMA people I talked to off the record saying,
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  they say something's coming.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Quail saying last week it was going to happen
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  in the next two weeks.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  This is just amazing.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Going back to medical Dr. Sherry,
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Tim Penney, and we're also talking to Justin
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  from Mexico City.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  We've called him there.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  He is there.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  And he was at a hospital there in Mexico City
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  where they're saying they had 20 deaths
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  from respiratory illness.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  I mean, did you ask the doctors
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  why you know they have one flu death?
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  I mean, were they doing blood tests?
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  How did they know?
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  But then were they being told to say
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  the other 20 deaths were respiratory?
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  This was obviously an unusual amount.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  So they were freaked out.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  I believe you were the caller saying
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  it was another caller Sunday from Mexico City.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  He was at the hospital.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  People were vomiting in the halls,
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  vomiting and collapsing in the bathrooms.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  I mean, what were you witnessing here three days there
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  while your wife was giving birth
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  in the middle of this melee?
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  I thought that supposedly they have a quarantine,
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  but they have the healthy pregnant women
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  mixed in with all the other sick people.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  That's what they consider the quarantine.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  But just that visitors can't go in.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  But all the patients are mixed in together.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  And I even saw a guy vomiting blood.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  And that they're selling the masks,
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  the respiratory masks for up to 50 pesos.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Well, they're only worth one peso.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  But people are really panicking.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  Even to the point where now people are stockpiling food.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  Yeah, well, even telling folks to do that
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  just as an insurance policy, but they don't listen.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Because we told people a couple of years ago
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  GM was going to go out of business
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  because we saw their internal documents coming out
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  and they laughed at us.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  I want to hold you over, sir.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  I want to keep picking your brain.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  But the best person to be able to brief you
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  or debrief you is Dr. Sherry Tenpenny,
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  medical doctor who was just in Mexico yesterday.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  Doctor, questions for the caller from Mexico City?
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Well, I have more of a comment than a question, Alex.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  I mean flu, influenza by definition is a respiratory illness.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  So people that were vomiting and passing out, throwing up blood,
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  if they're saying that this has something to do with this flu virus.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  So that means there's something drastically different about this virus.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  It's not a respiratory virus or it was something else.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  And for the sake of hysteria,
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  they're blaming it on the flu virus.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  And so it could just be some horrible cold bug.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Well, it could be a completely different type of virus
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  other than this H1N1 that they keep talking about.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  I mean, it was H1N5 or H5N1 with the bird flu.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And now this is H1N1.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  They're all influenza A viruses.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  And by definition, what those viruses do is cause a respiratory illness.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  Fever, chills, cough, pneumonia.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  It's a respiratory...
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  So you've got 20 deaths.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Why are they calling it respiratory versus flu?
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  I'm sorry?
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  I mean, if flu is respiratory generally,
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  then why are they saying, oh, this is a flu death, but these are respiratory?
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  I mean, did you ask the doctors?
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  That's my point.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Yeah, I know.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  No, I didn't ask the doctors.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  I talked to them quickly.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  My wife was giving birth.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  But they definitely seem nervous.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  They're all taking...
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  They're all begging the administration to give them the vaccines.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  They supposedly have some sort of vaccine that they can give them now.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  Yeah, that's the other issue I was going to bring up.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  I have confirmed that Calderon...
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Stay there, Calderon.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  Stay there, Justin.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  I'm going to come back to Dr. Pinpinning on the other side.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  We got calls Saturday that the Mexican president was on TV saying,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  we've got a vaccine, don't worry.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  I confirmed that.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  How would they have a vaccine or something that just became a big crisis Friday, Saturday?
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  And we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Sherry Tinpinning and our listener there in Mexico City.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  While Obama's already fudging.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  It's not about left or right.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  You worry if you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Her wild food knowledge package is the Crash Course.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal. She's my mom and I watched her do it.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Start now. Knowledge is power.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  Better take action. I think a storm's coming.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  All right, I got an email from an American ex-patriot living in Mexico saying,
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  Alex, you got it wrong. Mexico City doesn't stretch for hundreds of miles.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  What I said was, the suburbs are made up of hundreds of square miles.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Austin, Texas is, I think over 100 square miles.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  I mean, learn what I'm saying here. Okay, the point is it's big.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  Some years it's rated as the biggest city in the world. It's always in the top three.
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  It's big. 28 million they see in the city and the suburbs is 35 million total.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  So the big news here is North Carolina involuntarily isolating,
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  that's forcibly, North Carolina forcibly isolating suspected swine flu patients.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  That is the headline on infowars.net.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  infowars.net, Steve Watson reporting.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And he has links to multiple mainstream sources where they calmly announce it.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Going back to Dr. Sherry Tenpity who was just in Mexico at a major conference
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  and kicked out of the country, one with other Americans and other foreigners,
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  and then who drove by bus several hundred miles out of the country.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  They're out of Monterey now in San Antonio, Texas, just south of where I come to you from,
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  in Austin, Texas with this outbreak all around me.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Will it turn into a pandemic is the question.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Dr., you were just talking about the U.N. saying they're in control of the United States in Mexico.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Basically, those governments are following their orders.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  That's in all the major publications.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  The White House announced Sunday that we're under an emergency civil emergency
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  and is implemented the executive orders which are categorized as martial law.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  This looks like because they're shutting down schools all over the country
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  and they're involuntarily quarantining people that they are beginning to implement level five.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  Level five, Alex, and I actually am going to post this document from the World Health Organization
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  that was published in November 2005.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  So this has been in the works for a long time.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  This was this entire plan.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  When you read it, I want people to be able to read it.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Well, Sherry, you were cut off at first.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  You were saying, what about level five? This is level five?
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  No, that when we go to level five, that's when they will start instituting ring vaccination.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  Consider making lists of people to vaccinate.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  They will start to talk about mandatory vaccination at that point.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  That's level five.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Today in the newspaper, it talks about that we're currently at level four.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  So level six actually says, consider applying emergency powers.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  And that's right off of the World Health Organization document
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  that I'll post later today on DrTenpenny.com
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  so that everybody can find it easily and read it for themselves.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Okay, 24 hours later, what is your professional opinion?
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  It's a medical doctor who has been studying bird flu
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  and other forms of flu and pandemics for years
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  who's been in Mexico from reading what the other scientists and doctors and virologists are saying.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  What is your prognosis here?
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  It seems that from yesterday, you're saying things are darkening.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Yes, I believe that they are.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  I believe this is a plan that's coming together that's been in place
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  that says at least the publications in 2005
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  and it probably took them a year or two to put this together.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  It's ironic to me that all of these things are popping up all over.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  How can that be?
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  There can't be enough people who have been in Mexico that have spread this
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  to have people in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Atlanta,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  and Miami and Texas all over the place having been in contact with each other.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  And it's happening in schools.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  I wonder if these kids were just vaccinated.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  This has been the forced inoculation in the last few weeks
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  where they threaten the kids and say, you've got to take shots to be in schools.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Could be. It could very well be that.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  We just want to put a brief plug in here for the movie, V for Vendetta.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  If people haven't watched that, go rent it and watch it
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  because they actually talk about this whole plan in this movie.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  It's fiction, obviously, but they talk about starting with things in schools.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  The government releases a bio weapon to bring in martial law.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Yep, exactly.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  I'm really concerned about this, Alex.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  I've always thought that that was kind of like, yeah, sure, that couldn't really happen.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  Even from my rather conservative posts that I want to always just put out
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  documented information that I can find from conventional medical literature
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  that it just seems as though there is a bigger plan that's absolutely being put in motion here.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  Well, either way, they're hyping something that isn't that big of a deal
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  and using it for power and control, or it is naturally occurring
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  and they're covering up just how deadly it is, or they've released it
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  and are covering up just how deadly it is.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  All of the above, I agree.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  It could be any one or maybe even a combination of the three.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  There's a lot to be said for this,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  and I think that there's a lot to be said for how people can keep healthy.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  I'm a big proponent of health is from the inside out.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  If it's a weaponized virus, maybe our normal armamentarium isn't going to work.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  If it's a regular, just stronger strain of flu virus than things like vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin C,
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  drinking plenty of water, getting to bed on time, eating organic food.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  All of those things are the normal things that we can do.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And the most important thing you can do is not to live in the fear,
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  because the fear brings your cortisol levels up.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  When the cortisol levels go up, that makes your immune system go down,
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  and the fear itself makes you more susceptible to be infected.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Absolutely.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  What would you recommend?
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  How do people find nanomask?
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  I know they have masks that are much thicker that actually do really cut down on,
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  normally the virus is suspended in mucus from a sneeze or saliva or touching the eyes.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  I guess wash your hands a lot.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  If you were in south or central Texas where this stuff is breaking out or southern California,
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  would you take your children out of school, doctor?
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  I probably would, just from the sake of the hysteria of everything that's going on around there.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  I mean, I just keep my kids home and keep them healthy.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Even in the pandemic, the 1918 pandemic, yes, a lot of people died, but most people didn't.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  I tend to would focus on, I'm not going to be one of those people that are going to get sick.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  I'm going to continually do the things that I need to do to keep myself and my family healthy.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  And instead of focusing on the bad side, how many people have died,
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and how many people are going to get laid off and all this other things,
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  I mean, what if we focused on, it's not going to hurt me, I'm going to be just fine.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  And be one of those on the survival side of the equation.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  I think that that is an upbeat message that we can give while we're reporting in real time what's going on,
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  that if we stay out of the fear and do the things that we know we need to do to stay healthy,
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  that we'll be a survivor no matter what kind of pandemic might happen.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  But the bigger issue here is North Carolina and voluntary isolating suspected swine flu patients, infowars.net.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  I'm hoping that they're isolating them in their own homes,
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  and they're not throwing a whole bunch of people in one place who might be sick,
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  contaminating the people who weren't sick.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Absolutely. Well, I mean, speak to that, but also,
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  then we'll go back to Mexico City and then more calls with Dr. Tenpenny, our guest today.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  Looking at this, what about the vaccine? How can Calderon,
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  and I've confirmed this, and you just heard the listener that we've confirmed in Mexico City,
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  we called him back in Mexico City to confirm it, to have him saying,
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  don't worry, we've got a vaccine already ready.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  And then the caller said that when he was in the hospital, the doctors were saying they wanted the vaccine for themselves.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  I mean, how could they, if they just figured out in the last week this thing is deadly,
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  claim they've already got a vaccine for it?
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  You know, that's sort of an interesting comment.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  I'm glad you recycled that back around and came up to that.
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  Because according to the CDC, in order for a vaccine to be effective, it has to be an exact match.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  If they've just found out what this is in the last three or four days, that means one of two things,
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  one of several things.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  Either it's not going to be an exact match and they just want to vaccinate people,
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  or it's going to be what they call close enough and they think it'll give some protection,
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  or it's a type of virus that they've known for a long time,
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  and a lot of the biotech companies have been experimenting with this.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  I mean, remember back in 2005, they were given $7.2 billion through biosheels to start developing pandemic viruses and drugs.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  So, you know, who knows what has been going on over there.
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Let's stop right there.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  36th level four bioweapons labs moving Plum Island to San Antonio.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  Oh, San Antonio.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  You know, things like that, moving them from the middle of Montana to the middle of Dallas,
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  from the middle of, you know, South Dakota to New York City, yes, to Manhattan.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  All of this craziness, too, in the words of the Baltimore Sun,
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  the headline, create thousands of gallons of liquid death bioweapons to create bioweapons and then their cures, absolutely key point.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Yes, and they've also, you know, been doing things like posting up viral sequences on the Internet,
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  you know, under the auspices of sharing these sequences with other researchers in the world.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  Just like they put out the mousepox, which with a full ingredients list,
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  easily make a 90 plus percent kill rate animal pox for humans.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  Yeah, why do they do that?
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  And why are all these microbiologists being brutally murdered?
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  Well, I don't, I can't really speak to that because it isn't anything that I've followed.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  But I'll tell you, it is when I first heard about some of the things about posting up these viral sequences and it was like,
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  that made absolutely no sense to me.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  It's like giving somebody the recipe to disaster and saying,
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  oops, now we've created a disaster.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  So there's a lot of, there's a lot of amazing things that are going on, but it doesn't,
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  and then that may lend itself to be why this is supposed to be a piece of pig virus from several different parts of the world
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  and bird virus and human viruses because somebody has sequenced it from just taking information off the Internet.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  Well, every doctor we talk to, every virologist we talk to, or so we still in the news says,
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  probably engineer, but that's kind of a, just a back story, we need to talk more about that.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  Going back to Justin in Mexico City, what are you, you're saying it's a ghost town, people are starting to hoard food,
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  there's checkpoints, any other keep intel points for us?
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  Just that, a lot of people are starting to really panic.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  This on top of the economic crisis is just bringing this place to a standstill.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  I want to ask him, since he's down there firsthand, how much damage did you see from the earthquake that happened yesterday
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  and is that compounding the problem of people leaving?
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  Yeah, the six point out.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  To be honest with you, I was in the hospital and someone said there was just an earthquake and I didn't even feel it.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  As far as I know, it didn't really damage Mexico City.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  They said it shook major buildings.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  Go ahead.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  In Guerrero, it did more damage, I think, but it doesn't seem to have affected you very much,
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  but I'm sure it's made people panic a lot, you know, that on top of everything else that's happening.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  Just, it's just speechless.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  You know, I have three children.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  I'm not too worried about dying myself.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  I face death and I'm ready for it.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  I don't want it to happen.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  I really enjoy a lot of Augusto and, you know, I don't want my wife or parents or people to die,
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  but they've had lives.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  My children, I can't handle it.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  And let me tell you something, folks.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  Anything happens to my children and then it comes out, the government did it.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  That's it.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  I'm not putting up with any more of you, you Genesis crap anymore.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  All of you professors and the rest of you, I'm coming for you.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Is it safe, secure and healthy?
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  We at Baker Creek heirloom seed company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  and carry over 1200 varieties of GMO free heirloom seed.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  Go to www.rareseeds.com for more information.
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  That's rareseeds.com.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  Baker Creek heirloom seed company was started in 1998 by a 17 year old as a hobby.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds strive every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long term storage.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  Go to www.rareseeds.com and get your seeds from America's pure seed source.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  That's rareseeds.com.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist, who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one world government.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  How is it that we, the people, grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes and servicing debt.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works. Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  Isn't it time to understand the system? Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  Times are tough right now and people are unsure about our future. The economy is hurting even though there are powers that would make us believe differently.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  Banks are failing and the gold buyers are buying. Question, with all the chemicals being put into our air, how do you use gold when you are very sick or dead?
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Investing in precious metals is smart. Investing in your health could be smarter. Life change tea changes your life just by drinking our tea.

[1:23:51.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  Life change tea. We're changing lives.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  All they want us to do is keep on killing one another. That's a bracket.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  And if they got to release a bio weapon to get the job done, they're going to do it. All of their preparations are built around bio attack.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  They staged a terror attack to get the police state grid in place so the good old boys think of the police states for foreigners.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Then they secretly built it. They got owners, conservatives, veterans, and now declassified as we told you 10 years ago they were setting up.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  And then they staged bio attacks. But I told you they would do some soft kill, weak beta test first. And I believe this is a beta test.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  And if people go along with this and they can practice world government control through this, the big ones are to come in the future.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  And then Napolitano at a homeless security base, he says that, oh, this will probably peter out. But don't worry, a big mega death one is coming.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  I want to go back to Mexico City here briefly. But in closing, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, give people your website and comment on the things I was just saying.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  You concur with that.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  Yeah, thanks, Alex. There's two websites I want to give out to people. One is DrTenpenny.com, T-E-N-P-E-N-N-Y, DrTenpenny.com, tons of vaccine information.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  And a recent article that I just wrote called Swine Flu, the New Bird Flu, that's available for free on the site.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  There's another site for my other book. It's called Saying Notive Vaccines. And it's sayingnotivevaccines.com.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  The book, Fowl Bird Flu, It's Not What You Think, was written in 2005, is actually almost prophetic for the things that are happening right now.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  No, it's not almost prophetic. It is prophetic.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  It is prophetic for the things that are happening, and those are available on both sites.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  And I want to add, tonight I'm going to put up this pandemic plan that looks more like an action plan now, Alex.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  Because like we said, you know, USA Today says we're at level at phase four, phase five is about going to mandatory vaccination.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Phase six, and I'm reading it right from the document, says implement all relevant elements of national pandemic plan, including applying emergency powers.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  I want to continue to get updates from you as this develops. It's so important throughout the week. When are you going to be getting home tonight?
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  Actually, we're staying, we're going to stay in San Antonio for a few days. So we're going to, we'll be in San Antonio here actually until Saturday.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Wow, maybe we could have a car come pick you up and have you drive up to Austin and be in studio. But I don't want to, I know this is, you were actually going to halfway on vacation in Mexico.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  But we'll talk to you about that. I'll have my producer call you right now and try to set you up a couple times for the rest of the week.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  Let's go back though in the few minutes we've got left with the doctor, adjusted in Mexico City. Again, we've confirmed he is in Mexico City.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  This is basically just confirming all the other reports we're getting out of Mexico City and surrounding areas.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  But we're also getting reports of even small coastal towns areas that were the people aren't chemicalized and aren't poisoned where people are dying.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  So if it continues to be Hispanics that are mainly dying from this, even in the U.S., if we start seeing that pattern, this is clearly race specific.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  Dr. Tinpenny, you have any comments on that?
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  No, but that's a very interesting premise, Alex. That's very interesting. You've probably had a few people on your show over the years that were experts in things like, you know, chemtrails and things like that.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  I would be interested in knowing what their comments were about the possibility of this being spread through the air. It just seems too random to me to be a face-to-face person-to-person contracted virus.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  And that's just my opinion.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Well, governments thousands of times have released chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on the public, including the U.S. government.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  So they're the number one suspect. Any other key points that come to mind, Justin, in Mexico City?
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  I guess I'm worried what's going to happen if they cut down all the transportation. How is the food going to come into Mexico City since they don't produce anything on their own?
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  Wow. Great point. That's a really, really good point because, you know, as we know, Mexico City is the largest city in the world and, you know, its land surface area is huge and they don't grow any food there.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  That's a really excellent point.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Why would they be, if this isn't some super-mega-death virus we're talking about, why are they acting? Again, they're talking on both sides of their mouth.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  But through all this crisis, we're going to pray for you and everybody down in Mexico City and all over the world for this is happening.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  But they're at the epicenter. And did you have a boy or girl, Justin?
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  A girl.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  Ah, congratulations.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  Thank you.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  Yeah, congratulations. My wife called up during the break and said, congratulate him on the baby.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  And don't vaccinate her.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  I won't.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  Good.
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Thanks.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  Did they try to vaccinate her at the hospital?
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  I think she's too young to be vaccinated.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  Not here in America. They come in with multiple injectors, you know.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  Yeah, they come in with the hepatitis B and the vitamin K at birth and then things start at two, four and six months.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  And so you may want to get my book saying no to vaccines and learn some more about that before you decide to proceed.
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Okay, thank you.
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Doctor, thank you so much. Sherri Tenpenny will talk to you very, very soon. Tomorrow if you can do it, take care.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  You bet. I know we have loaded phone lines. More of your calls coming up.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  We'll stay in contact with our Mexico City correspondent down there.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  And we got Dr. Diegel coming up right now and your calls.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  You'll lose on your capital investment and you'll lose purchasing power as the dollar continues to devalue.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  One thing is certain, having physical possession of gold and silver will guarantee that no matter what happens, your investment will never be worthless.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  Call me today, Peter Crotch Novel at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  You've worked hard your whole life and I want to work hard for you.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging. He's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com, or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying Factory Direct at wholesale prices.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog. We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  Factory Direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods. Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:18.000]  That was disconcerting because Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, you know, was saying she thought this was a bunch of hype yesterday.
[1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  She didn't think that anymore. She thinks the new owner is making its move.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  The next 30 minutes, we've got Dr. Deagle on with us. We've got Dr. Rebecca Carly coming up in the last hour,
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  but the whole next hour, we open phones. In fact, I'm going to take calls with Dr. Deagle right now.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  Matt in England, Matt in the UK. Have two mats from the UK?
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  Tom in Texas, Chris in Wisconsin, Bill in Iowa.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  It's like getting three cherries on a slot machine or something. They have two mats from the UK.
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  I don't gamble, folks. That's a joke. I gamble in life. I don't gamble and gambling with lottery tickets.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  I think it's ridiculous, but side issue here.
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  We're also keeping on the line for a few more minutes, Justin in Mexico, because he's down there in Mexico City.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  He was just in a hospital for three days with his wife giving birth to a baby girl,
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  and they were saying 20 people died there of a respiratory illness.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  Another person, they quote, said, was flu, but flu is respiratory, but it's very nature.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  At least in the autoimmune over response. So we're going to talk to Dr. Deagle here in just a moment.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  I just hope this is them fair monger and to sell a bunch of vaccines and Tamiflu,
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  and to try to forcibly inoculate folks to try to set that precedent as Time Magazine Newsweek and others are doing.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  I hope they're not really moving with something that's going to kill a bunch of people that are in a hammer,
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  and so it can spread real good. They're just kind of covering up how dangerous it really is.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  I hope this is just hype, like Gulf of Tonkin. It was a stage terror attack.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  No one attacked the ship. They just said it was attacked and launched the war.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  I hope this is just a staged event where they're just overhyping it to get the fear and expand their new world order.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  You know, that's a lesser of two evils. I hope they haven't really launched a hot weapon.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  And in fact, let's play now because I keep talking about it.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  That CNN clip, this is a general, multi-star general. Let me pull that up.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  I actually got that up on prisonplanet.com.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Top General comes out and says that we have to look at this being made in a laboratory.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  So let's come out in a moment.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Before I go to Dr. Diggle in your calls, I do want to encourage listeners to continue to spread the word about this radio show
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  because we are watching and tracking and integrating all the information.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  I don't think there's really anywhere else where you're going to hear this many guests and this many calls and this much information
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  in all angles, all possibilities through a historical lens of who the global star,
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  what they've done in the past, what they've done with vaccines in the past,
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  how they really swine flu and bird flu in the past, how they've killed American citizens, troops and others
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  with chemical and biological tests that everybody knows about.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  Both people know about four or five of the famous cases. There are thousands.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  This is the place and see, this isn't a game. It isn't a joke. It's when people call in and say,
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  I like this talk show host more or I don't like the way you talk to callers or, you know, do you work for the Tooth Fairy?
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  I go, look, it isn't about me. These are globalist mass murderers. You can debate all day who runs the New World Order.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  The point is the globalist want to carry out a giant eugenics operation and exterminate the majority of the planet on record.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  And we've got a face what these killers are saying. They funded Hitler. They funded Stalin. They funded Mao. They funded Pol Pot.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  And the guy that brags he funded Pol Pot is the advisor to Obama's of Big New Brzezinski and his daughters,
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  the anchor on MSNBC with Joe Scarborough. These people are up there running things and they mean business.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  This is the real world. I'm thinking about the New World Order setting me up or killing me or my family dying of bio weapon attacks.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  That's why I come in here and work 18 hours a day. That's why I worked till 4.30 in the morning last night and got three hours sleep.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  And I don't deserve your thanks. I don't want your thanks.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  I know I'm taking some Deagles time. We'll hold them over the next hour. We can do it. The point here is this isn't a joke.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  This isn't a game, people. And all the infighting, all the little patriot groups, it's like a peanut gallery and a popularity contest.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  You boys and girls who sit around infighting and sniping and everybody shouldn't be in this movement if you don't grow up
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  and put on the big boy pants and get out of your diapers and realize you have joined a life and death situation.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  You're on the front lines. You might as well gut up and grow up.
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  We need every person to get serious, to get focused and expose the globalist, the eugenics agenda.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  That's why Endgame is the most important film bar none ever produced about the New World Order and the systems that control us
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  because it integrates their history, who they are, what their goals are and what they're going to do.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement. It's free on YouTube and Google.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  Email it to everybody now. Obama deception. It's free on YouTube and Google.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  YouTube version's got 1,600,000 views. It's over 15 million views. Last time I counted it up total that I saw.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  But that high quality one YouTube channel, somebody had a great upload of it, changed the channel's name to the channel.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  It's not my channel. He's got a director's account, you know, the full two-hour films up there, super high quality.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Get it out to everybody. Sure, I know you know about the New World Order listeners, but your neighbor doesn't.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  And they're finally ready to hear the truth. They're finally ready.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  If we don't have a massive awakening, a renaissance, a revelation, a enlightenment about how the world really works,
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  and if we don't get past the puppets of left-right paradigm, the globalists are going to win.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  This is a beta test, I have no doubt. And it's the police state and the crackdown on the vaccine that comes that I see in my gut in the analysis.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  And the final equation is the real threat. This is the beginning of things that come that are very bad.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  And all the left-right baloney, all the fake conservatism, all the fake liberalism, goes out the window and the New World Order drops the hammer.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  So listen, go to infowars.com, get the Patriot t-shirts that spread the word so you can meet like-minded people on the street,
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  like live free or die with a amendment on the front. This is our uniform.
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  Come and take it. They're going to try gun confiscation during a complete collapse.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  They can do that under these executive orders. We're in trouble, folks. It's happening.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  This is the real world. The globalists killed 60-plus million people over the 40 years of purges in Russia.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  60-plus million is to a few years of purges in China.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  They mean business. The same people run what's happening here now.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  And they want a massive purge, a re-engineer of this society, and gut out the middle class.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  So I'm telling you, go get the Obama deception on DVD. Get in-game on DVD.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  Show it to your church. Show it to your neighbors. Get it out to people.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  Buy a DVD burner. Make copies of it.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Infowars.com is the website.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  I'll also tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  One of them is survivalseedbank.com.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  And a real crisis having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  There have been times in American history, pilgrims, for example,
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  and seeds of the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  who wanted to control us by controlling the food supply.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Governments are storing seeds that you and the storing seeds,
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  globals of every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Why do you think this is? You know why. Control and power.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Solutions from science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist hands
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  and into the hands of the people. One seedbank at a time. One family at a time.
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  A survivalseedbank from solutions from science contains enough
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  unapollinated seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  Seeds in a survivalseedbank are handpicked for exceptional germination rates.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Survivalseedbank.com. Survivalseedbank.com, or 877-327-0365.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  877-327-0365.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  One other sponsor for these crazy times.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  If you're afraid of firearms, you've been gelded, you were never trained on them.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Go buy a firearm, get some training.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  But if you're not going to do that, or you've got children in the house,
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  this is, you know, we've got our stuff locked up in pistol safes,
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  but we also have pepper spray on top of the bookshelves and things,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  so if they did climb up and accidentally get it, it wouldn't kill them.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  But they've been taught not to touch it anyway, so it doesn't matter.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  But the best thing to have is pepper spray.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  You've got a daughter sitting in the college, your wife, whatever.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  They've got high quality pepper spray, stun guns, tasers, animal repellents,
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  home safety, personal alarms, pepper spray.com, pepper spray.com.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  The best prices around since 1994 on the Internet before that as a store.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  800-908-9988, 800-908-9988, pepper spray.com, 800-908-9988.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  Get prepared with non-lethal weapons, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Okay, arm yourselves.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  In areas where they've got basic gunmans on, most of those places allow pepper spray
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  and things like that, or stun guns or tasers.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  You've got to check your laws.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  The point is, get these systems now.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  I believe in it.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  Pepper spray.com.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  Okay, that said, I want to go to a bunch of callers here, people in England,
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  you name it, and Dr. D, I'll hold you over a little bit into the next hour
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  so we can have plenty of time for you to be able to put out the latest developments
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  since you were on with us yesterday.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  And then we've got Dr. Rebecca Carly joining us at 2 o'clock central,
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  coming up in an hour and 15 minutes, an hour and 70 minutes to be technical.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:06.000]  But just in a brief summation, in the last 24 hours since you were on with us,
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  a lot of new developments have happened.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  They've gone to level four.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  The next level is basically Marshall Lobb.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  Forced inoculations are beginning.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  Texas counties plan mass vaccinations in March.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  That's being reported.
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  Guadalupe County, Texas, had prepared for mass vaccinations program
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  in the event of a pandemic.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  Local officials have 36 hours to treat their entire population in Guadalupe County.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  We'll be 115,000 people.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  Ron Maloney writes for the local newspaper.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  So this was already going on before.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  So we saw this massive mobilization before all this broke and before all this started,
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  and then getting ready all these mass graves.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  Dr. Diegel, I hope to God this isn't it.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  Well, this is the beginning of the end.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  And I don't think that we have one strain of virus present.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  I'm pretty certain we have more than one substrain.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  The cases in America right now, as far as I know, there's no confirmed deaths.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  The cases in Mexico City, whether it's due to the toxicity or malnutrition,
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  there's almost certainly a different strain there.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  And a report I have is that half of the cases are this lethal strain,
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  and the other half is the same strain as in the United States and Canada.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  So what we're dealing with is that.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  The lethal strain is going to get here, and even if it's race specific,
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  the country is 15% and growing Hispanic.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  So we're going to find out if it's race specific real fast.
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  Absolutely.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  In fact, you've got to stand back a bit and listen to the reports that Dr.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  Aitruat reported about General Qi Hao Xian in 2005,
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  that the Chinese were planning on plotting on an invasion of North America.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  And if I was picking a land to invade,
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  being the Cold White North of Canada, I'd be invading Mexico first.
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:00.000]  And I'd be clearing out the population of Hispanic peoples in the Mexico and
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  America if I was planning on a eugenics policy.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  Now, wouldn't a General Eugenics race specific bio weapon kill Chinese
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  if it killed Mexicans because Mexicans are a Spanish slash Asian,
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Asiatic mix from over the Bering Strait.
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  I'm getting an echo off his line.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  We might want to check that genesis.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  Go ahead.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  Yeah, it's possible.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  I think that one of the problems that we often see is the globalists and
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  their scientific, you know, brainiacs think somehow they're control of the chaos.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  And this is a form of chaos.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  I would like to refer to this as the lab recombinant hybrid virus.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  I don't like to call it swine flu because swine flu virus doesn't kill pigs
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  or pig workers and 20% of veterinarians carry antibodies and 25% of pig workers
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  carry antibodies and it doesn't cause death.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  This is a recombinant virus that's a bridge.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  The best way to describe this is they've blown up the world now with a viral load
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  of H5N1 that's clearly been weaponized.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  There's six different clades or substrains of H5N1 that are circulating
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  around the planet.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000]  They're now in every corner of the earth.
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  And these six clades have an average case fatality rate when it does occasionally
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  get into humans of 70%.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  And it's anywhere from 25% to 100% fatal.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  So what we're dealing with now is this new virus is very efficient at jumping
[1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  between humans and it's because it's recombinant with Asian, human, swine, etc.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  What this virus is, it's a bridge to allow it to jump into humans and other animals
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  like cattle, sheep, horses.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  So I think the first way we see in America, none of the actions that should have been
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  done are done.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  Right now what they should be doing is moving in with large heavy lift aircraft
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  to give things to the host population so that the virus doesn't spread.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  For example, one of the things that I recommended years ago, and we talked about
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  this with somebody working with Homeland Security, Dr. Gordon Peterson,
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  who's the PHDMT that developed the Super Silver.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  They actually have a program called Aeroclave, but they have a, he's talked
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  about Homeland Security and I talked to him last June in Washington, D.C.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  that he recommended that they have capacity to fly in large capacities of these things
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  and other natural things that will improve host defenses, because vaccines take
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  six months.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  When they say they're putting a vaccine out in Mexico, this is metalsome.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  It's dangerous.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  They're actually inserting a tannuated virus that's actually going to add new
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  genetic material to cause new super substrains to emerge.
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  When they give the Osaltamivir or Tamiflu, within four days, whatever little bit
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  of virus that's still sensitive will become totally resistant.
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  Just like Dr. Sherry Tenpenny says, if you have a population that's sickened
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  by starvation because of current famine in different countries,
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  the host of it's got more free radicals of a person starving.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  It makes the virus more aggressive.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  Dr. Why is Tamiflu, the Japanese government's admitted, causing people to commit
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  suicide and have psychotic breaks?
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  Because the process by which they make Tamiflu generates a hallucinogen that's
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  very much like LSD or angel dust.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  It's identical in its effect on the brain to angel dust.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  Now, I don't think you want to put angel dust in your mouth when you think
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  or give it to your police forces.
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  So now all of a sudden you're going to put your police and military on angel dust
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  and say, go out there with a flak jacket on and an AR-70 machine gun.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  This is craziness.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  And some people are very sensitive to it.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  There's a case of about a year and a half ago of some Japanese youth that were
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  exposed to a batch that particularly had a lot of it in each batch varies,
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  and they decide to jump in front of one of their bullet trains.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  Because they thought there were supermen that could fly.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  This is the kind of craziness that's going on.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  And the plans of Homeland Security are totally military.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Their plan is to activate detention camps.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  I've talked to military personnel recently who've given me information that
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  they have 50,000 returning U.S. troops now trained at an enormous pace since
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  January, since the inauguration of the usurper in Chief.
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  They've been training them for riot control.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  Under the declaration of Sunday, this is not even rumor or secret sources.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  They admit they've implemented a civil emergency.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  They've now taken the gloves off.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  The question is, how much of it will they actually implement?
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  But no, we're now under martial law.
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  I got a Homeland Security whistleblower who sent me actual pictures of the
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  biosuits they have.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  And they're called a Kempak Nomek suit.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  They have a flak jacket, Scott air pack, et cetera, and the internal documents.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  They're getting ready right now for level five.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  And when they go to level five...
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  No, I've got them too.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  It says it right here.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  I've got the Homeland Defender and the Homeland Security report here in front of me.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  They're getting ready.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  To be honest with you, if you actually look at the definitions of
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  World Health Organizations, if you have consistent spread among
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  continents and human to human spread in large clusters, you are at level five.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  So when they declare that the World Health Organization moved from level
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  three to four, they're liars.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  And when they go to level five, which is what they should be at right now,
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  the Patriot Act and all those other acts that are executive orders that were
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  put in by the last moron in the White House, George Bush, the junior,
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  they are called the baby emperor, these orders basically mean forced
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  vaccination at gunpoint, forced medication, and forced quarantine.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  And if you refuse to be vaccinated, you can be at gunpoint, forced into
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  civil detention camps for quarantine.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  They're going to increase vaccination.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  And the U.N. is running this on record mainstream news reports,
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  and they've been caught adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women,
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  putting HIV in shots.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  And so I would think the real bio attack will be the vaccine, Dr. Diegel.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Oh, and it's going to amplify tremendously.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  If this gets done and they move to the next level, things are going to really take off.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  All right, stay there.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  Phone calls are coming up and a lot more.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  If you've always wanted to experience the amazing benefits from using
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  the oil of oregano, the time to act is now.

[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  interest of the American people.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  While Obama's already fudging.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  It's not about left or right.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Matt in England.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  Justin's still there, we'll get the eagle coming up in the next hour, ask some questions of him.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  But Matt in England, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Hello?
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Yes, go ahead.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  You're right, Alex.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  Now I've got something you might find interesting.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  My mother, she works in a nursing home and one girl, she works with her sister, has got some bad flu or something,
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  has been quarantined off in Scotland and apparently they gave her some strange vaccination.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  I'm not sure how true it is, but my mom is saying that, I don't know, it's quite...
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  I don't know, have you heard anything about what's going on in England at all?
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Well, there's a lot of weirdness going on, let's bring that up.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And to Dr. Diegel, there's Spiegels reporting in Switzerland a train in a car with passengers,
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  quote, a bird flu vaccine, excuse me, swine flu vaccine, explodes on the train.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  I mean, what does that even mean?
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  Yeah, actually, I got a copy of that report.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  It's a container of the flu virus samples packed in dry ice, exploded on a Swiss train and reported in Reuters.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  And apparently it was a box of the swine flu virus that was in the vaccine.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  And it's a different strain than the H1N1.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  Now, one of the problems that the misnomers are calling it a swine flu, this isn't swine flu.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  This is a recombinant lab flu that was probably sprayed by a PSYOP group that sprayed it on the population
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  on the garbage heap around the Mexico City.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  So this is very timely because Geneva, Switzerland is the headquarters of the World Health Organization.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  I call them Dr. Who.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  In 1997, I spoke at Zurich against fetal tissue transplants and the super soldier program privately to the board of the Human Life International.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  They took me inside after the meeting, gave me a foot of documents and spent hours explaining the three projects.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  And one of them was to create a super virus by resurrecting gene fragments from the 1918 flu with deceased whalers dead in the permafrost,
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  pulling out their lungs, dissecting the virus and then literally creating with a supercomputer a resurrected 1918 pandemic,
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  which is a recombinant of WSN 33 and the oldest Iowa flu strains in our database.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  This recombinant was created when they created a typhus vaccine that they passed through pigs that had the pig flu
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  and it infected our troops.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  They were troop transports, very, very sick and tired, flying to Spain, and that's why they called it the Spanish flu.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  They have resurrected this.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  They then added avian genes, sprayed it, and they told me these documents in 1997 that they actually were in the process.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  They had funding from the Rothschilds, the United Nations and World Health Organization were overseeing the whole project.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  The National Institute for Allergy Infectious Disease, the CDC, and USAMRID were all involved.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  And there were four countries, Israel, Britain, Canada, and America, making these viruses.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  And that's why they killed so many specialists and scientists and even doctoral students that were working on the flu.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  That's why we had the trail of dead scientists.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  Let me stop you and back you up on that.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  This is from Sidrep.umn.edu.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  This is from a university CDC press release.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  This was put out by the CDC.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  And this is from January 14, 2004.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  CDC to mix avian human flu viruses in pandemic study.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  And they've done tens of thousands of these.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  And remember, then in 2005, the FedEx truck wrecked that had all the live bird flu on it.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  So I said they were doing this to create a cover story.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  It's ever tracked back and linked to them.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  Matt and England, anything else?
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  No, that's cool, man.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  Take it easy.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  Now, God bless you. God speed.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Drink plenty of vitamin C and hope they haven't released the big one on us, these murdering pieces of filth.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  There's no doubt this is a designer virus.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  The only question is, is it a mega death killer?
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:59:52.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:03.000]  Big Brother.
[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  Mainstream media.
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  Government cover-ups.
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  You want answers?
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  It is an incontrovertible fact that eugenicists, you believe in exterminating at least 80% of the world population,
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  official United Nations law, biological diversity assessment and policy, 1996,
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  the end game, blueprint for global enslavement and, of course, in my 2002 film,
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  America Destroyed by Design.
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:45.000]  You know, the video of the photocopies of the official U.N. biological diversity assessment.
[2:00:45.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  And I'm going to get more into it.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  You should just go to the official U.N. website, read it for yourself,
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  or you're not going to believe me if I tell you what else it says.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  I'll tell you.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  It goes ahead and says they want a devil worship and that they want to set up Aztec Sacrifice Centers.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  You cannot make it up.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  I know it's insane.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  It is insane.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  But go read it.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  These people are out of their minds.
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  I mean, it sounds crazy to say Ted Turner saying, get rid of the useless eaters.
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  And Prince Philip says he wants to kill us and can't wait to release deadly viruses.
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  But they write books saying this.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  The Club of Rome, they are moving with their carbon taxes.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  They're moving with their global government.
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:31.000]  And they need to collapse everything and have a smoke screen to get that job done.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  These people are out of their minds.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  Let's go to Matt in the U.K., another Matt.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  Matt, you're on the air with Dr. Diggle.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  How you doing?
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  From a parent to a parent, I really do hope this is a high pal X.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  But first of all, my thesis from the U.K., excuse me, is,
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  remember the foot and mouth outbreak in the U.K.?
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  That was all amazingly hyped up in this lot of a lot of cattle.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  And it turned out it was the government.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  The government admits they released foot and mouth.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:03.000]  Yeah, but basically they put a lot of people out of business.
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  The farmers went bust, a lot of suicides.
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  What I think they're going to do is to hype this up in the U.K.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  is what they'll do is they'll kill all the other livestock, the pigs, indefinitely.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  And that'll create a well-wired economic slump.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  Yeah, Germany, Russia, they're all banning U.S. pork.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  And Russia's banning all our meats, basically.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  And it's all absolute hype.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  The pigs aren't sick, it's not coming.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:31.000]  Dr. Deagle.
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  It doesn't do a thing, out to the pigs.
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  What happened at Porton Down, the facility?
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  And I actually talked to a scientist there, and he told me that the place
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  is supposed to be a negative pressure facility because they're working
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  with dangerous bio-weapons, is that you didn't need to open a window
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  because you couldn't, but it was so drafty, it's not surprising
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  that the foot and mouth disease got out to the local cattle.
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  I'm guarantee you it was a forced release.
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  And what they really wanted...
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, they admit in the BBC months after we were writing it was
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  that in two days it shows up all over England in cows and sheep.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  And then they said, oh, some environmentalist that works here must have stolen it.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  Oh, yeah, right.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  No, the government had to spread that.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  Exactly.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  Just like the anthrax strain that got out during the thing right after 9-11
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  was a weaponized strain from Ames, Iowa.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  Now, here's the thing people need to grasp, and I'm very concerned about this.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  This latest strain isn't just a, quote, a swine flu.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  This is a virus that can leap into horses and cattle.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  And if it gets into farms of other, quote, meat crops like, you know,
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  not just chickens, but also, say, into cattle and so on,
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  this could wipe entire herds of them.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  And I believe that what they're trying to do is they want to cut off food supply.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  The economics of what's going on right now worldwide,
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  the collapse of the world economy and the disappearance of wealth,
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  is that we currently have an economy worldwide that can support 5 billion people,
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  6.5 billion.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  So a billion and a half quarter excess population,
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  according to the globalists, because they're ready to proceed.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  And I think this is the beginning of the end.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  I think they want to have a false peace treaty very soon.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  I think that this is a dry run, but in days, weeks, or months,
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  maybe perhaps by September when Henry Kissinger said in Europe
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  that he was expecting America to be disarmed by the fall, by September,
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  I believe that they're planning on having a release enough
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  that they can activate, even if there's not many deaths,
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  martial law and grabbing people's guns.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  Okay, Matt and the UK, anything else?
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  Yeah, I was going to say that on the final point,
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  I reckon what those kids, I'll mention about it,
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  they'll slaughter the pigs and everything else.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  And it'd be a precedent that starts to bring in GMO.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  What do you reckon about that?
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think that you're right on.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  You have an answer that GMOs the answer to the famine,
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  and that's weaponized to destroy your health.
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  Stay there, stay there, stay there, we got a break.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  Come back, more of your phone calls straight ahead.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  I'm going to get a take from Dr. Rebecca Carly later.
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  Alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  to boost alkaline ingredients. Using plasma pH drops
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  Simply put, 10 drops per liter of water you drink
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  Order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  by going directly to alcovision.com.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  That's alkavision.com.

[2:05:57.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  that I think all of us would like to see.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  that's fascism.
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  It's not about left to right.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  It's about a one-world government.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  This film documents who Obama works for,
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  the lies he is told,
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  and his real agenda.

[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  The Obama deception.
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  The people strike back.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  that continues to fail comes an increase in crime.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  in case of an attack.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market

[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  deep behind enemy lines,
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  the information war continues.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  Okay, we just started Sarmal Casting Live
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  I had Justin, who's in Mexico City.
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  We've called him there.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  He contacted our office, but we wanted to double check
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  that he was in Mexico City.
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  We had a lot of calls from Mexico City saying the same thing.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  A lot more dead people than you're hearing.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  A lot more people sick than you're hearing.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  We had Dr. Tim Penning on about who was in Mexico,
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  couldn't get a flight out, in Monterey had to get out by bus.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  They told him the police came to the hotel,
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  told everybody to leave.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  She was bussed out of the country.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  She's now in San Antonio.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  Dr. Deagle, do you have any questions
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  before I let this caller go?
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  Do you have any questions dealing specifically
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  with what he witnessed three days in a hospital?
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  What Justin witnessed in that?
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  Well, what does he know?
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  Mexico City Hospital, go ahead.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  The first thing I would ask is,
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  if there are any quarantine,
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  is to stick all the inpatients together.
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  It means maximum cross-contamination.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  It means pregnant women and others.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  So that's a stupid policy.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  The second thing is to hear doctors quote,
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  demanding vaccines when the doctor should know better
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  that it takes six months to make a vaccine
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  with egg membrane technology.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  So it shows me that the health professionals
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  are talking about really are not informed.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Secondly, vaccines don't protect anyway.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  All they do is create a titer,
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  which is an antibody against a virus.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  You have to actually have a true host defense system
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  in order to protect the body.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  And that's why being healthy prevents primary infection.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  So that's number one.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  The other that I've heard actually from other reports
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  is that they don't have proper masks.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  And if they don't have a respiratory fit mask,
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  like these biosuits I've seen,
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  actually that the Homeland Security
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  are going to wear with Scott Airpaks and filters,
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  you have to have an antiviral mask
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  that's actually going to have a respiratory fit,
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  like a NIOSH N100, or even better, a nanomask.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  If you don't have those,
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  and you're working around these sick people,
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  the very first casualties,
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  with the SARS or coronavirus,
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  these are a big virus.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  These are many times bigger.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  They're the largest virus pretty well that infects humans.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  The influenza virus is a very small virus, relatively.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  And the droplet masks that doctors wear are useless.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  So the first thing that's going to happen
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  if there's a true pandemic,
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  doctors' clinics, hospitals, and others,
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  is that we're going to see a major die-off
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  of our health professionals.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  And our first responders and our EMTs
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  and our police and other people that are direct contact
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  with sick people that may be in panic
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  over what's going on.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  I'd like to know...
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  Meanwhile, the Homeland Security's walking around
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  like supermen in the respiration suits,
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  taking care of, just like on 9-11,
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  they were all out there wearing...
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  FEMA was out there wearing respirators,
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  telling firemen and police, the air is fine!
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  The air is fine!
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  Exactly. They've got a Scott Airpack on.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.000]  Well, everybody else has got a particle mask
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  that is for a painter that doesn't even stop
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  the larger, the smaller particles.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  So, exactly.
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  And that's why we have a disaster in the brew here.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  And both FEMA and all these other agencies
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  want to increase maximum cross-contamination.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  What I'd like to know, not only in Mexico,
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  but in the UK, what are they talking about?
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  Vaccination?
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  Why are they telling all foreigners,
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  get on planes and leave, which right in the middle
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  of the outbreak will vector all that?
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  They're making the borders more open during it.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  So, the first thing I would do,
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  immediately as I shut down all air travel,
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:59.000]  and I'd have everybody called multiple times a day,
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  and I'd have them not only cultured,
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  I'd have a culture swab of their throat,
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:05.000]  not just a Z-stat flu test,
[2:12:05.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  which is a rapid test I had in my clinic in Denver,
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  to measure, because that will miss
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  up to 15-20% of cases,
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  even in the peak of an infection.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  So, you can't use a temperature.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  For example, Japan has basically blocked anybody
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  coming into the country that has a temperature
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  over 104.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  That's useless.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  They may be in the incubation, exactly.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  They can be shedding virus all over the place.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  It's totally useless.
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  Same way, they tried to use thermal scanners
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  in the Toronto airport and other place
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  when they had a major outbreak.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  It was useless.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  I want to go back to our caller in Mexico City,
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  so he can finish up any comments
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  so we can let him go.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  Do you have any questions of Justin in Mexico City?
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  I'd like to know what kind of news reports are there.
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  Is it a blackout?
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  How many people are really sick?
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  What's the ratio of deaths?
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  See, I guess that there's at least two substrains,
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  and there may be emerging other ones.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  And in the steamship era,
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  we would have new strains emerge
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  every so many months because it took so long
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  to travel.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  Now that people can fly around the world,
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  we could have new substrains emerge,
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  not just here, but in Europe or elsewhere,
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  where people are taking this new strain.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  They could emerge from Eastern Europe
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  right now, and once these get embedded
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  into the population, I'd like to know
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  what's the real death rate?
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  Are they getting any real reports?
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  Let's ask him that question.
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  You were saying the doctor said
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  in that hospital you were in alone,
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  and you've been out there for a day,
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  20 dead people.
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  As far as I know, they only have a few facilities
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  where they can actually test
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  whether that's the virus or not.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  So it's very likely that people can die.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  It's not flu season.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  It's a virus which you can do a test in 10 minutes.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  It's this recombinant lab virus,
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  unless proven otherwise.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  I mean, it's like if you hear the hoof beats,
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  it's probably horses and not zebras.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  So if there's 20 deaths
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  from an acute respiratory illness,
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  you know that this is almost certainly
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  this viral bio-weapon that's been released.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  And if they can even just do a rapid test,
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  which any doctor's office anywhere can do
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  for influenza A,
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  they can confirm, oh, you've got this virus,
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  they almost certainly this is the bug.
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  And if they have 20 deaths,
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  what's the case fatality rate?
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  See, I want to know that.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  And this is the problem.
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  We don't see the genetic clades.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  They should already have that report out.
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  Which gene groups are they?
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  Are they reporting it to not only the public,
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  but also other scientists?
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Yeah, they should be putting out the sequence publicly,
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  or at least the makeup,
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  so that all these independent research
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  interns have got to work looking at it.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  But they're being a little bit secretive
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  about the makeup of this virus.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  You could be in a cellular culture.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  If you thought vaccines would work,
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  which I know they don't,
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  you could actually make in a cell culture
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  vaccine in 30 days.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  But the problem is the virus continues
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  like a whirling dervish to keep changing.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  And so if they say they're going to have a vaccine
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  in six months, which you've actually,
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  CDC has stated they will
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  in Homeland Security,
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  just after the targets already moved
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  and gone into another state.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  It's ridiculous.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Yeah, that'd be like if you wanted to kill Alex Jones,
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.000]  so you went to the house I was born in,
[2:15:16.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  that I haven't lived in in 30 years
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  and blew it up.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  It's insanity.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  And for them to say these doctors
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  that supposedly demand vaccines,
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  or they're going to give something,
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  first off, there is no antiviral drug
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  that can stop this.
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  I mean, for you, because you've been following this
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  for a long time and really obsessing over the bird flu
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  and saying it was coming or something like that.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  Well, I know it was coming because they told me
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  they were building it.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  Well, they admit they've built it.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  It's CDC admits they've done it.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  But the issue here is
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  now
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  we know viruses as they go through human bodies
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  and animal bodies, they are always
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  changing, mutating, like bacteria
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  or anything else.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  Well, the genetics of humans as we
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  say, that's what we do here.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  Now,
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  how does this generally work?
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  Because I get to see different schools
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:12.000]  of thought and virologists, different doctors.
[2:16:12.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  Is it more rare for a virus to mutate
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  into something harmless?
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  Or is it more common for it to mutate
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  into something bad?
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.000]  Or is it the characteristics of this virus
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  being this transgenetic mutagen,
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  this cross species of virus
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  with animal, pig
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  and bird?
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  And then it didn't come from the east
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  as all flues do.
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  It originates in Mexico.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  Outside the flu season, I mean,
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  you've had all this together, it's amazing.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  Well, so when you need to probably interview
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  is Dr. Henry Elnaman.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  Dr. Elnaman probably is the head of
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  recombinomics and Pittsburgh is the top
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  virologist in the recombination.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  I believe that he is smack on
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  99% of the changes in any virus
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  whether it's flu or any other virus
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  is recombination, not reassortment,
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  like shuffling cards
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  and not mutation.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  Mutation is very rare, it occurs when it's radiated
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  or there's incredible amounts of toxic material
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  around like radioisotopes
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  and toxic halides.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  What happens with recombination
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  is similar to what happens in human cells
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  when we make a baby.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  Your genes come together
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  and there's a thing called synapses
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  where genes are swapped.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  And this virus, meaning it has
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  from four different sources, human,
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  had synapses with viruses
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  on three different continents.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  So it's a lab virus.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  The danger right now is that this lab virus
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  is a bridge. It's a bridge because it
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  attaches to human cells. It's got the binding domain.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  It may have one or more of the lethal genes
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  and it's going to acquire new genes
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  either when it moves through territory
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  like China or Eastern Europe
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  where we know that the virus is endemic,
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  H5N1, or North America
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  where there's millions of birds dying
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  in British Columbia, Washington State
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:56.000]  and Oregon and California and elsewhere in the U.S.
[2:17:56.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  You can pretty well find
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  the high-passagenic avian flu
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  in birds anywhere now on any continent.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  Now this bridge virus is going to
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  acquire a new. So it's a process
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  we're saying this could be
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  the bridge from the
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  bird flu, which is what Baxter got caught
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  mislabeling to 18 different countries
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  weaponized bird flu
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:18.000]  that wasn't highly
[2:18:18.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  airborne to be mixed with a perfect
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  spectrum of
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:24.000]  standard human
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  acquireable
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  flu viruses mixed in
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  the major vats. Thank God
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  a subsidiary contractor tested it
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  on ferrets, killed them dead in a hammer
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  and they found out this had happened. Then everything got
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  shut down and quieted.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  Then we learned there were all these secret tests with people
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  homeless being given, it being killed
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  and then Baxter
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  out of hundreds of big companies is chosen
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  to make the World Health Organization
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  vaccine. I mean this is
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  really starting to get serious. It's really evil and there's actually
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  six companies
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  that are doing the vaccine. I tied contact with
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  three. We not only had contact with
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  Pfizer Pharmaceutical, which is another evil company
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  and I had
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  November 2007 documents sent to me by
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  whistleblower in New Jersey at a health
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  park there, which is blue or not in a mall
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  that was playing around with H1N1
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  which is resurrected
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  by the government
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  by, you know, USAMRID and CDC etc.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:18.000]  and they're also playing around with H5N1
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  and recombinants and they're playing in most
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  embryos and most hybrid
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  embryos, okay? Most human hybrid
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  embryos, which are part human, part mouse,
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  okay? They're doing all kinds of ghoulish
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  experiment. And by the way, listeners, if you're ignorant about this
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  don't roll your eyes. Just google
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  animal human hybrids. In fact, google it right
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  now because the general public still doesn't know
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  they got chimpanzee humans,
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  cow humans, spider humans, goat
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:42.000]  humans. They've got
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  these creatures that
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  might have 20 different animals in them. Plants,
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  insects,
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  pull up a human mouse hybrid. Let's show
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  folks that.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  And that's how they help make up a mouse pox
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  that has a 90% kill rate
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  in homosafety and sapium.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  With food prices soaring to all time highs,
[2:20:00.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  what can you and your family do
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  will make it to your dinner table?
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.000]  Garden in a can.
[2:20:10.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  Garden in a can is your source for premium

[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  In the New World
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  Order's war against humanity
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  Barack Obama is the tip of the
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  spear. We've got to have a
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  civilian national security force
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  that's just as powerful, just as
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  strong, just as well funded.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  The Obama deception
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  completely destroys the myth
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  that Obama is working for the best interest
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  of the American people. Well Obama's
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  already fudging. Yeah, fudged
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  since day one in this election. If you have
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  movement of personality cultists
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  who is imposing the program
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  of a group of extreme bankers
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  and finance oligarchs, that's
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  fascist. It's not about
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  left or right, it's about a one-world
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  government. This film documents
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  who Obama works for, the lies
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  he is told, and his real
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  agenda. Get your copy

[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  deception. The people strike back.
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  Have you ever
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  felt like the United States
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  government knows way too much about your
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  financial affairs? I continue to hear stories
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  about property seizures, frozen bank
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  accounts, confiscation of stocks and
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  citizen will ever again have the right
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  Unfortunately, with the
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  1933, some precious metal
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  holdings are subject to government intervention.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  For this reason, Midas Resources has
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  prepared a report explaining the
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  Whether if you have any intention of trading
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  Midas Resources or not, I have instructed
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  my representatives to give this report out free.

[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  Alright, I want to thank
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  Justin in Mexico City. We'll stay in contact
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  with him day to day as our contact
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  there with what's happening. We'll pray
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  for you Justin. We appreciate you and
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  congratulations on your newborn daughter, but
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  not just some money from Mexico City but some money that was in a hospital.
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  We'll take more calls for
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  Dr. Diegel. Doc
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  Time will tell
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  with all of this as it unfolds, but
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  there is no doubt
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  that the globalists have engineered
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  past plagues
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  that bio weapons have been used by governments
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  to wage
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  siege against populations
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  since 1500 B.C.
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  and I've got the historical
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  text here I want to go over coming up in the next segment.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  And we know they stand
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  again from this and I've been saying the last few months
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  there's no way they can get their agenda through
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  politically
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  raping the people, financially raping the people
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  unless they stage crises in the
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  composed saviors and make people so worried
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  about their very lives
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  that they will accept the transition
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  to open world government which is now happening.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  And that's clearly going on right now
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  so whether this is real or hyped
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  they are using it
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  people aren't talking about Obama being for torture
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  or leaving the troops in Iraq that was coming to a head
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  they're not talking about the 12.8 trillion
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  that's been stolen by the banks.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  Mexico isn't on the verge of revolution anymore
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  this is just a godsend for the new world order
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  and then you have all these drills and all the preparations
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  in a crescendo
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  leading up into March and April
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  and now all this happening
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  I mean you put it all together and just the evidence
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  of stacks and stacks
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  and then we know they're lying about the real number of deaths
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  and illnesses
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  saying everything's fine but then acting scared to death
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  this is just
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  really wild.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  Let me read a letter actually
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  that's in a news report from Mexico
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  by a respiratory specialist
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  published literally
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  two days ago
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  Dr. Antonio Chavez, a doctor working in Mexico City
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  and I'm going to quote
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  That's BBC, go ahead
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  I'm a specialist doctor
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  in respiratory diseases and intensive care
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  at the Mexican National Institute of Health
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  there's a severe emergency over the swine flu here
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  more and more patients
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  are being admitted to the intensive care unit
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  despite the heroic efforts
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  of all the staff, doctors, nurses, specialists, etc
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  patients continue to inevitably die
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  the truth is that antiviral treatments
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  and vaccines are not expected
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  to have any effect
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  even at high doses
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  it is a great fear among the staff
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  the infection risk is very high
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  among doctors and staff
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  there is a sense of chaos
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  in other hospitals and we do not know what to do
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  staff are starting to leave
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  and many are opting to retire or apply for holidays
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  the truth is that mortality
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  is even higher than what has been reported
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  by the authorities at least in the hospital where I work
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  it is killing three, two, four
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  patients daily and has been going on
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  for more than three weeks
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  this was reported on the 26th
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  and it's now confirmed that the Mexican Government
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  AP reports knew about this
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  March 18th, go ahead
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  it is a shame and there is great fear here
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  increasing younger patients
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  age 20 to 30 years are dying
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  before our helpless eyes
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  and there is great sadness among health professionals here
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  this is from Alvaro Ricardoz
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  Oaxaca City
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  Oaxaca, Mexico
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  and then he went on to say
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  they are covering it up because they do not want to cause panic
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  but I think it is better at this point to go ahead
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  and just tell the truth
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  exactly and close the border too because
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  these cases, the real high pathogenic ones
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  will come to San Diego
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  here is the issue then
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  it is going to come to California
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  what is going to happen
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:42.000]  so we are going to find out soon
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  if it is only Mexicans dying
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  then we know this is very specific
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  what if it starts
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  killing people
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  then we know we are in deep trouble
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  in this capital of my state, Oaxaca
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  there is a hospital closed because of a death
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  related to the poor seeing influenza
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  in the papers they recognize only two people dead
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  for that cause, my friends working in the hospitals
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  related feel say that the situation
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  is really bad, they are now talking about
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  19 people dead in Oaxaca
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:10.000]  including a doctor and a nurse
[2:28:10.000 --> 2:28:12.000]  they say that they got shots
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  but they were told not to talk about the real situation
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  our authorities say nothing
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  well did you hear the Mexico City fellow
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  saying
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  21 people
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  died in the hospital
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  I am sure the numbers are far worse
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  here is the real problem
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  if we have a high pathogenic flu
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:32.000]  we do not know how many of these lethal genes
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  can be played, if they were published
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  we would say ok, it is acquired at the PB2G
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  it is let's say at the polybasic amino acid
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  in the HG so it can grow in the brains
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  here is how sneaky this virus is
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  this virus can incubate in your body
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  and they have already known this
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  homeland security knows it can grow 8-10 days
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  you can be shedding virus, you don't have a temperature
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  don't have a cough, don't have anything
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  it takes a while to get this
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  long incubation which is really bad
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  and then people are sick for weeks and weeks
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  speak to that
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  but the people that recovered
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  by the way from the 1918 flu
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  they developed frozen man syndrome
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  which is caused by damage to the tecton of their midbrain
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  they developed Parkinson's disease
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  and they developed a very aggressive form of dementia
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  years or decades later
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  I took care of them in the 1970s
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  that developed these syndromes
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  after surviving the 1918
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  swine flu pandemic
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  alright let's blitz through phone calls
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  on the other side in our final segment with Dr.
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  Deagle
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  MD
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  and we're going to go directly to your calls
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  Tom, Chris, Tony, Mark, Amber and others
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:36.000]  1-800-259-9231
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  phone blitz coming up
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  already kept all the top stories
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  we are pretty much exclusively covering this flu situation
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  because we have to
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  meanwhile the globalists are
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  stealing us all blind and that's what they plan
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  we're on the march
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  the empires on the run
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  John's and the GCN radio network
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  you are a rebel, admit it

[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  well join the club
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  Einstein failed math, quit school
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  amazing discoveries
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  Edison rebelled against the dark

[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:28.000]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  and led the creation of a new one
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  now Alex Jones is working to save

[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  let's go
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  We are here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in central standard time.
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  I've come back Sunday's 4 to 6 p.m. You know, it took many years of research.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  I'll be able to admit to myself just how evil the globalists are and to face what their agenda is.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  Are we helpless or will we defend our families and rest control the planet away from these madmen?
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  Go ahead and go back to Dr. Diggle on your phone calls. Tom, in Texas, you are on the air worldwide as we have continual coverage of the bird, swine flu, human flu, designer flu scare.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  Good afternoon, Alex. Dr. Tenpenny had mentioned the randomness of the spread of this NWO flu.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  I've been looking at maps of where these reported cases and suspected cases come up and it looks like it's following the interstate trucking routes and popping up in like, you know, fueling depots or areas where you would have to get fuel.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  No, no, no. We have 30 million illegal aliens in this country, most of them from Mexico, 80 plus percent, and there's millions of them going back and forth in any one week. That's one way to spread it.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  But you also have tourists all over the world, so that's one way. The issue, though, is it isn't killing people, but it hasn't really gone mega viral yet.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  The pandemic and its spread yet. I don't know if it'll be pandemic and its mortality, but it's morbidity, whatever the proper term is.
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  And so that's the big issue. If it starts killing people in the West who have better medicine, who are healthier, but we've confirmed in Mexico, it's killing the heads of museums.
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  It's killing healthy people. It's killing people in coastal towns. It's killing farmers.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  Something stinks and we're going to put this puzzle together in the end.
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  Dr. Diggle, you want to comment on what the Tom saying?
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  Yeah, it's actually an ancient ceremony by these Satanist globalists. It's called the ceremony of the phoenix.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  It goes back to ancient Sumer, Egypt, et cetera.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  And what they're doing is they're using a bird just like Alfred Hitchcock, the bird's movie, is a thriller, and they're using it as a vector to bring these genetics.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  They have a bridge virus they released. And I don't believe that we're seeing the worst of it yet, by any means.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  I think that this even even as Napolitano says, believe it or not, she's saying the truth this time.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  If it blows over in two weeks or six weeks, look out.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  And the reason is they're not doing anything to stop it.
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  Now they're telling us they're going to make a vaccine, which is useless to an organism that's going to change, even if a vaccine would work.
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:14.000]  They're not talking at all about blocking the borders to prevent people to carry the more lethal strains up from Mexico or air travel.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  They're doing nothing. In fact, everything they're doing is going to make sure there's maximum spread of this cross-contamination.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  But Dr. Diggle, expanding on that, I mean, this could just be, I mean, we know there's 15,000 CDCs, there's 36,000, but people I've talked to say they exaggerate the number of flu deaths every year.
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:37.000]  But I mean, let's just say it's 36,000. You got tens of thousands of deaths from flu every year in Mexico.
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  And so a couple hundred people are dead. Let's say they're covering up, let's say 1,000. Let's say 1,000 are dead.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  Let's say 5,000 are dead. Hypothetically, still, while the fear mongering, that's what makes your heckles go up to see the martial law grid going in.
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  Are they just using this hype to cover up the news cycle with all the other issues that they want to cover up, the people rebelling in Mexico?
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  Absolutely. They're using it as a tool. The first problem is the statistic. They don't actually have, if you're to say there's 36,000 deaths, the first thing they have to do is, number one, they have to prove that they had that virus in their system.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  So when they write it on the certificate, they don't have viral proof. That's number one. I was one of the reference clinics in Denver that actually did the viral test.
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  A lot of times they hospice some old lady, they say she died of flu or give it to drug interaction or a bad surgery. They don't want to be sued for malpractice, so they say flu.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  Yeah, exactly. And the other thing that happens is, and I know when I put somebody in the hospital, those who got the flu ended up on a respirator and needed all kinds of intensive care, they always had mycoplasma.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  And by the way, mycoplasma is one of the components in the chemtrails. I call them biotrails as a better term.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  So they always had mycoplasma. If they had flu, which we could pick up on their blood tests, they always had mycoplasma if they ended up on a respirator or other problems.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  So the statistic, number one, is exaggerated in the first terms of the number of deaths because there's many different organisms. There's hundreds of pathogens that can cause respiratory death.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  This could also just be a cover for something that they've released separately. You never know what their disinformation is. Anything else, Tom?
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  I just wanted to point it out that I saw the pattern where all the cases reported looked like it's along the interstate.
[2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  Yeah, it's up the NAFTA Superhighway, I-35, the Canamax. You're absolutely right. Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  That makes sense.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  Let's talk to Chris in Wisconsin. Chris, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  Hey, you know, I don't know if this is fear-mongering or not, but I'll tell you, there was a chilling article I read back in February, and it's a local Wisconsin company building 195 refrigerated morgue trucks for Navistar.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  That's a lot of bodies.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  No, no, no, listen, it's not a rumor. Glenn Beck comes out and says it doesn't exist.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:55.000]  Yeah.
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  I have the mass grave folder here, and it's Rocky Mountain News, it's internal documents, a division of cemeteries, state of New York. You can call the phone numbers.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  It's up on infowars.com, and the article, Plans for Mass Graves Confirmed Government Surveying Cemetery Readiness for Flu Outbreak.
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  And I've been tracking this for years. It's all suddenly the last two years just exploded, and they're telling feds, hey, get ready, it's going to happen.
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  They're telling local police, get ready. I mean, how did they know? How did the, in 1996, how did the Air Force do a study saying there'd be a massive flu outbreak in 2009 that would kill 30 million people?
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  I mean, how did they, how is all, I mean, folks, this is all I do is research this, and I'm telling you, there's a curveball in here. Something is going on.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  There's more than meets the eye to this, and we've got to remember the globalists are ready to do anything.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  Dr. Diggle on the issue of mass graves.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Yeah. In June of 2003, the U.S. government and Department of Homeland Security received six million body banks, and these were not to be shipped to Iraq or Afghanistan.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  That was just the first shipment. They've been receiving shipments literally every couple of months in that order of magnitude, including these coffins that can put more than one body in.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  I have their documents and reports that they actually were planning on figuring where they could put the bodies, like in old coal or tin mines, below the water line, so it wouldn't affect the ground table, so they could literally drop the bodies in because they don't have the facilities to burn them all.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  So they want to stick them in body bags and put them below the water table.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  By the way, I have the Rocky Mountain News here. This is all admitted under what the CDC has announced in this Homeland Security emergency. That's all in the executive orders. This is not our opinion, but Glenn Beck will get up and say it doesn't exist.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  Yeah, I know. Isn't it ridiculous? And the fact is that we're not, by the way, this is a new term I'd like to use, Alex, and I'm sure that you'll like it. We're no longer conspiracy theorists. We're agenda analysts.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  We're now agenda analysts. We're just, as I tell people, don't believe, just read. And then your movies, by the way, are the best, the end game and global enslavement.
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  These movies explain and just show you the cold hard facts where the people want to believe they can go back to the documents themselves and says, my gosh, we're not exaggerating.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  There's a bibliography for the Obama deception at the obama deception.net. Everything in there is documented. There's a bibliography for end game blueprint for global enslavement. You know, this is not, this is not our opinion.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:40.000]  And people try to debunk my films. They do straw men. They say, oh, his film shows Bush's people and shows Kashkari and Alex is saying that guy works for Obama. No, we don't.
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  We show that both groups work together. And then it's bipartisan. And they try to spin that. I mean, they can't debunk anything.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  Yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, are they happy? I mean, I remember, I remember, you know, this one guy would call and he works at a car dealership from West Virginia.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  Two, three years ago, tell me I was a liar. The economy wasn't going to implode. The bankers weren't going to make a bank of the world. GM wasn't going to be in trouble.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:10.000]  And now look at what's happening. I mean, you know, what does it take folks for you to realize we know what we're talking about?
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  Anything else? Anything else that you need to add there? Chris in Wisconsin?
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:20.000]  No, just that they ordered these trucks in December and they got to have them delivered by next month.
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  All right. Yeah, it's all coming. Well, they got this huge FEMA drill for a nationwide takeover coming up in a week.
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  Yeah, by the way, that takeover drill is on May 1 and 2. May 1 is Beltane, which is a Satanic Holy Day.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  You can't make it up. These people are crazy. Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Arkansas. Tony just hung up, as I said that. Mark and Indiana, go ahead, Mark.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:45.000]  Alex?
[2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  Yes.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  I don't know if you remember me. I called back in October with the Obama confrontation and then I got on YTV confronting Charlie Gibson. You remember that?
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  Yes.
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  Okay, great. Well, what I did this past Saturday is, you know, the OAS, that's the Organizing for America, right? It's based out of the White House.
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  Yeah, the private thug group with billions of dollars publicly to go out and enforce things for them.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  Right. Well, I went there this Saturday to one of those meetings posing as wanting to be a community organizer, right?
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  But what I did was, you know, I raised my hand. There's probably about 75, 80 people there. So what I did is I raised my hand.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  I said, I prepared a half-page speech on community organization. Would you mind if I read this? So I went up there and I got in front of all these people, right?
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  And the first half of the speech is just, you know, after eight years of war and economic hardship, blah, blah, blah. As community organizers, we need to make sure that our country goes in the right direction.
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  You know, and then, and right then, was when I just said, you know, Obama has proposed a million-person national security force, talked about, you know, Ronald Manuel in the 1825 Universal Service, and just these people's faces were just like jaw drop.
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  They had never heard of the proposal.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  And because you opened it up by attacking Bush, you ended the left-right membrane of control, and they were absolutely defenseless to the truth.
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  That's exactly what I presented it as. Just imagine if Bush proposed this. You know, people would burn the city to the ground.
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  And if you approach it like that, you can break their programming. That's what the Obama deception does. What did you do from that point on?
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  Well, I read my speech, and then after that, I elaborated. You know, I said, Obama's calling for a world order, Bush, baby Bush, you know, Papa Bush, Bill Clinton, all of them were calling for a new world order. You know, Tony Blair, you know, I was naming all these people that had been calling for the new world order.
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  And seriously, you know, these people's faces, I could tell that, you know, they could tell I was speaking from the heart. They could tell that this was factual, and I really hope that they went and researched this.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  No, no, you're very confident, and you're focused, and you've got the forces with you, as they say. You've got the spirit, and that's what it takes to get the job done.
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  I'm surprised they didn't have a troll there. One of the minion organizers, did they try to shut you down at that point?
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  Yeah, they cut my mic, but they pretty much cut through my whole speech, but as I was elaborating, they cut my mic, but I kept talking. I said, please Google Obama's draft, Google the Obama deception.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  It details how he is, you know, a front man for finance capital, a salesman, there to sell an agenda that Bush or McCain could never sell to the public.
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:57.000]  You know, he's groomed and catapulted, groomed by the, you know, financial and intellectual elite in place there to sell the agenda, and so, you know, like that.
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  And listen, their whole agenda was failing. If they don't start a war, if they don't stage a bio attack, that's how they get us to, even though we're in hardship, rally around the government, quote, come together under them.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  They need crises and that is certainly, whether it's hyped or real, that's what this lab made, designer flu is all about.
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  I salute you. Good job. Dr. Deagle, again, I go back to that point. They, you know, I didn't say a year ago they were going to release bird flu.
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  I was saying at the last two months, I said some type of flu. I see him preparing. I see that being set up. I see all these drills.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  The same pattern I saw before 9-11. I said, get ready, brace for it. I believe they're about to play the bio card.
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:47.000]  And again, it's not that I'm even that smart. It's that I constantly study this.
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  You're obsessed. That's why, you know, you read, you actually apply your, you know, the reason is, I like Alan Sting's article a month and a half ago, he said, people that win, win because they're 100% committed or 110%.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  You win a war not because you have better weapons because you're more committed people. It's like Gideon's army.
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  He didn't want the one that would lap up the water like a dog. They had their eyes above the water and they're bringing the water to their mouth because they weren't even putting their head down to look into the water to get more water in their mouth.
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  If you aren't 100% committed, realize what's on the table, people. It's not just your death. It's not just the death of your kids. It's the death of mankind completely.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  This is the end game, as your movie says. We're now in the final run up to a new world order that's literally planning on demising and killing 90% plus of the world population.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  That's right. Their official numbers are 80, but when you look at the new scientists graduating, they actually openly ridicule the old 80%ers and say, no, we've got to kill everyone.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  We've got to kill ourselves. It's totally nihilistic. They're out of their minds and then you see their white papers and their graduate papers from years ago.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:03.000]  You Google their name and it's them at Bio Weapons Labs in white coats.
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  All the medical schools, all the universities are all teaching the same garbage. It's not just Dr. Pianca.
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  Let me ask you, when you went to medical school, were they teaching this? My dad at UT, we got to kill everybody.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  Yeah. Listen, I was one of the charter members of Greenpeace and I got real angry back in the 70s because I was doing oceanography and bacteriology before I went into medicine.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  I got real mad when they started playing these games with seal pops and doing other garbage.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  They hijacked it, completely took it over. The Rothschilds and the globalists took over the environmental movement.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  It's now run by idiots like Mr. I call him Igor. Al Gore is a liar.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  This guy with his carbon dioxide and the new world currency, I call it the carbon debt units.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  It's an anti-life currency where the world currency that's coming that they've actually agreed upon is a anti-life currency based on debt against carbon.
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  That means us carbon dioxide. It is literally opening the bottomless pit.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:03.000]  Yeah, we are carbon-based life forms.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  This evil is so palpable and then I have people that want to argue, say, look, people may not like my personality or your personality.
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  We're just committed. We're like a wild, we're like the army there of William Wallace.
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  And I've got roses in the blood of William Wallace, flows in my veins, let's put it that way.
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  And I'm not going to back off. I know we don't have, we have to realize just what's on the table here.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  This is, this is the final deal. And when it is this wave or this fall or next year, they're coming.
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  They're coming now.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  Absolutely.
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  They're coming.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  This bioweapon attack is the tip of the spear for the new world order. And so is Obama, their closer.
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  Neutromedicalreport.com, Neutromedical.com.
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  Dr. Deagle, we'll talk to you again later in the week. Thank you so much.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  More of your calls straight ahead. And then we're going to have Dr. Rebecca Carly on with us as well.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  Thank you, Dr. Deagle, for all your insightful information.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:55.000]  Big jokes.
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.000]  Thank you so much. We'll be right back.
[2:50:57.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests of the American people.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:37.000]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:52:37.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  I've got one more silver dollar
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  But I'm not gonna catch me no
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  I'm not gonna catch the midnight down
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:52.000]  And the road goes on forever
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  I've got one more silver dollar
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  But I'm not gonna catch me no
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  I'm not gonna let him catch the midnight down
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  I got some really bad news for folks
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  and I've generally found these guys to be pretty accurate.
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  It's their world service out of Iran.
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  But Google this for me in there. I'm gonna get it from another source.
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  Who to raise swine flu alert to level five?
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  Now level four is total police state crackdown.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  They want to shut down schools, things like that.
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  Level five is forced inoculations.
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:36.000]  We read from level five UN World Health Organization documents earlier.
[2:55:36.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  Considering a rapidly increasing number of confirmed swine flu cases,
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  and again they keep calling it swine flu.
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:44.000]  It's a designer virus, clearly.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  The World Health Organization, it's a transgenetic virus.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  I mean, they're all transgenic, but it's three different species.
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:55.000]  Who officials have decided to raise the pandemic alert level to phase five?
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  Swine influenza swine flu caused by time-pay influenza.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  Regular leads to influenza outbreaks among pigs.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  The virus is not normally infected.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  Humans confirmed sufferers in the United States and Mexico, however,
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:10.000]  are believed to have spread the disease to their families and others in contact.
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  Yeah, Google it. Find me something else other than that.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  Do World Health Organization who level five?
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  I'm going to get that from the UN.
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  The alert level was increased to level four on Monday,
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  and the World Health Organization officials now said they will be forced
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  to declare a phase five alert soon.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:34.000]  And this supposedly a UN news briefing.
[2:56:34.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  Another having a CDC one come up in a few minutes.
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  We're still awaiting for a final confirmation of the US authorities,
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  but it appears that there's a number of cases in New York
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  which appear to be human to human transmission.
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  Well, we've known that for days.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartle told a news briefing.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:57.000]  The United Nations Agency also raises alert level to four on Monday
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  as the virus was detected in several European countries.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  Mexican authorities say the new strain has killed 149 people.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  Are you kidding? It was 150 something yesterday, and that's a whitewash.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  Some 64 confirmed cases have been reported in the US in five states.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:15.000]  Texas and California first.
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  Did you find under who level five anything else?
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  Okay, BBC.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  Just try who level five.
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:31.000]  Dumb that search down.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  Maybe that'll bring it up.
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  But that is from press TV. We'll look into that.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  I saw that from AP. I tried to get it from another source.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:45.000]  I've never seen press TV with any flat out baloney.
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  So we'll try to look into that.
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:49.000]  We're going to come back, take more calls.
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  We've got Rebecca Carly coming up. Lots of calls there as well.
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  But right now let's go ahead and jam in.
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  Amber in Canada. Amber, go ahead.
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:57:57.000]  Hey, Alex.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  It's Amber, actually, without the B in Ottawa.
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  Amber, Amber, sure. The screen is over there. Go ahead.
[2:58:03.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  Right on. Thank you. Just three points I want to make here.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  We're having a screening tonight of Kevin Annette's Unrepentant
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  and a screening of your movie Endgame tonight at the Mayfair Theater,
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  1074 Bank Street in Ottawa at 7 p.m.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:25.000]  Just want to let all your Ottawa listeners know about that.
[2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:31.000]  Second thing is just reading the Ottawa citizen here about the swine flu,
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:34.000]  the hybrid, whatever they're calling it there.
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:56.000]  Stay there, back in 70 seconds with Final Hour.
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:09.000]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:16.000]  that's safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:19.000]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:24.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[2:59:37.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:42.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  Take action today. The first step is getting storable food.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  All right, we've got a medical doctor, Rebecca Carly.
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  Different perspective.
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  And Dr. M.D. Sherry Timpinion.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  It was in Mexico yesterday.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  M.D. Dr. Bill Deagle joined us as well.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  Dr. Mecca Carly and lots of your calls in a recap.
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  I've got some other news.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  It isn't bird flu potential pandemic.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  I keep calling it bird flu.
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  It's more akin to that than swine flu.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  It's a designer virus, no doubt of that.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  In fact, I keep mentioning this.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  And I haven't done it the last three hours.
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  Next segment to introduce Dr. Rebecca Carly.
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  We're going to play a little scene in play with the top general.
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:54.000]  The tired saying, we need to look at this being bred in the lab.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  That is coming up.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  But, Amor, in Canada, you had another point you were going to make
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:02.000]  about what's in the newspaper there in Canada.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  Now, I'm just reading today's Ottawa Sun,
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  our authority, Ottawa Citizen here.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  And it's saying that there's five suspected autoans being monitored
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  and they flew in from Mexico.
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  So nothing really big yet here,
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  but I just wanted to make that point.
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  The third thing I wanted to ask,
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  it's probably to one of the doctors there,
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  is you mentioned oil of oregano yesterday and colloidal silver
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  and a lot of great things.
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  Now, I've never experienced oil of oregano before,
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  and I'm sure a lot of people haven't, or colloidal silver.
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  I'm just wondering what's the best method of administrating this stuff,
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  and I'll gladly take my answer off the air.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  We love you here in Ottawa.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  All right, thank you, sir.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  I'm not going to practice medicine here on air.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  Now, I've had these medical doctors on,
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  and I've been looking at this for years,
[3:01:50.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  and I especially have children who try to find out what to have in the cupboard.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  You know, I bring up elderberry, which is an antiviral.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  That can also, they say, trigger with certain things an autoimmune response,
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  which is actually what kills healthy people.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  But again, I'm not practicing medicine here.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  I'm just telling you what the doctors have said,
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  and what I do myself.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  Colloidal silver, the smallest nanoparticles you can get are important.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  I wouldn't take it all the time
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  where you can build up the metal in your body
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:20.000]  and get a blue tinge to your skin, literally.
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  But, you know, taking it when you're sick,
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  medical doctors say is good.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  Smaller the particle, the better.
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  Very powerful antibiotic and antiviral.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Oil oregano, just full of vitamin A and others.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  When you put one drop in water, it's like super strong.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  It's kind of like peppers, though.
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  You get used to it once you've...
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  I mean, I can drink Tabasco now, and it doesn't...
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  Well, just like oil oregano, I can take quite a bit of it.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  Very powerful.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:52.000]  There's also a lot of raw garlic, or lots of it cooked, roasted garlic.
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  You know, put it in the oven with a little bit of oil under it.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  So it's like butter.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  I don't put butter on bread, folks.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  Probably got horrible breath, but whatever.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  Take that garlic out, put it on the bread.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  It's so good.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  That's really good for you.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  Lots of water, lots of sleep, and just loving God and being happy.
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  But if it really starts breaking out
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  and killing people in the U.S. and other places,
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  don't put your kids in school.
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  You got to stay home.
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  I mean, it starts killing people.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  But, I mean, the flu every year kills 30-something thousand.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  I keep saying 15, because most doctors say it's really about half the number.
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  But 30-something thousand people die of it.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  Why are they...
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  Why all the fear over this?
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  Is it just a political distraction?
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  Let's hope as bad as that is that that's it.
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  Let's go to another call here.
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:30.000]  Don in PA, you're on the air.
[3:03:30.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  Welcome.
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  Hello, Alex.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  This is Don in Pennsylvania.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  I just stumbled across a little news item.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  I didn't hear you mention in the last two days.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  It's on Forbes.com.
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  It's a cross post from Reuters dated 48 hours ago.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  And that's the head of Homeland Security saying that...
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  Let me guess, that's her saying,
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  hey, even if this flu doesn't kill you, the next one will.
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  Well, the exact title is yes.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  Nepal Tana says U.S. should prepare for new flu outbreak soon,
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  even if this one fizzles out.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  It's still posted on Forbes.com,
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  but if you hit the link to go to it,
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  it is now restricted and you cannot access the story.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  I know.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  That's amazing.
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  I first saw that Sunday after a press conference,
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  and they were all admitting it was a whole article.
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  Later, I went back and it was just her blurb at the top,
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  and I've never seen a Reuters statement like that,
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  but I think we were taping her Sunday.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  We ought to go pull that up from the actual press conference,
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  or somebody should put that on YouTube.
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  I appreciate your call.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  Anything else, Don?
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  That's it for the moment.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  Just keep up the fantastic work.
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  Thank you.
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  Now, we're trying our best here, sir.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  Thank you so much for all your support.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  Please spread the word about the radio show.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:48.000]  People are ready to listen right now,
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  and they need to hear the wide spectrum of information
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  to make up their own mind.
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  We're not even saying what's happening here.
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  We're just pointing out what's happened in the past
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  and what's going on.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water,
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  and did you know that you have greater exposure
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  than when drinking the water?
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead,
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  mercury, and iron.
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:26.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts
[3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:29.000]  10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:34.000]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals,
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:35.000]  and bacteria.
[3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:36.000]  What about you?
[3:05:36.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[3:05:57.000 --> 3:06:00.000]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:06:03.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:09.000]  that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:06:09.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  just as well-funded.
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:14.000]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  of the American people.
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:19.000]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:22.000]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  that's fascism.
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  It's not about left or right.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  It's about a one-world government.
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  This film documents who Obama works for,
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  the lies he is told,
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  and his real agenda.
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  The Obama deception.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  The people strike back.
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  If you owe the IRS,
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  you can't make the problem go away
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:03.000]  without professional help.
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:05.000]  But with the help of Dan Pilla,
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  you can get your problem solved.
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:08.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  and I've been solving tax debt problems
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  for 30 years and I can help you too.
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  We can stabilize IRS collection action
[3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  and get your tax debt reduced,
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  sometimes completely eliminated.
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  And if you received a 1099 from a bank
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  because of mortgage or other debt forgiveness,
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  the vast majority of the time,
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:25.000]  I can show you how to completely erase it
[3:07:25.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  so you pay no taxes on what the IRS
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  will consider to be taxable income.
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:30.000]  Call us for a free consultation
[3:07:30.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  to discuss the many possibilities.
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  Call 1-800-34-NO-TAX.
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  That's 800-34-N-O-T-A-X.

[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  Dan Pilla has been protecting taxpayers
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  from the IRS for three decades
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  and he can help you.
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  Call us today.
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  800-346-6829.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:08:06.000]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX.
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  Frommadı.tv,
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  from the chair, I'm sitting in in this studio,
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  Nine to Midnight Central Standard Time.
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  That's 10pm to 1am Eastern.
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  That is 7-10 at Pacific.
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  That is 8-11 Downtown.
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  So nine to midnight tonight
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  and they're big things developed.
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:43.000]  I will also be in studio for part of that
[3:08:43.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  where they'll all call in on the show.
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  I was on Coast to Coast a.m. last night
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:49.000]  until 4am central.
[3:08:49.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  So I don't know if I'll be staying up late tonight
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:55.340]  But that was certainly a very informative transmission as well.
[3:08:55.340 --> 3:08:59.360]  George Norrie's got a lot of courage to let me and Steve Quayle on there to break down
[3:08:59.360 --> 3:09:03.360]  the history of government-sponsored terror and the obsession with biological weapons
[3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:04.360]  and the past things they've done.
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:09.000]  I don't know how he's able to have 16 million listeners tonight and get out what he does.
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:12.440]  He's the only show out there that's mainstream and big, second biggest radio show in the
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:16.600]  world, only, second only the Limbaugh, where, and actually just never tells you what you
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:20.720]  can or can't say, never censors, we just want to thank George Norrie and email him and
[3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:24.280]  let him know I appreciate what he's done for this radio show as well on our websites.
[3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:29.680]  I mean, I would say 20% of our growth, I mean, we owe probably 20% of everything we've been
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:32.320]  able to do to George Norrie.
[3:09:32.320 --> 3:09:36.240]  He's been interviewing me for five and a half years now.
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:40.000]  He took that show in a different direction and he calls it the entertainment when he's
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:43.880]  doing the Trubicabras and ghost stories and stuff and he goes, then we do serious shows.
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:47.000]  And he'll say, this is a serious show tonight.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:49.240]  And so I just, he's really taken that show in a different direction.
[3:09:49.240 --> 3:09:51.240]  I mean, it's still got a lot of wild stuff.
[3:09:51.240 --> 3:09:53.000]  My grandma stays up late at night and listen to it.
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  She enjoys it all.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:57.520]  It's a lot better once on TV, but it's not knocking what he does.
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:10:01.400]  The point is, is that he's taken it in a really good direction and it's an amazing courage.
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:04.080]  We appreciate George Norrie, so I'm thanking him here on air.
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:06.400]  I really don't really give credit where it's due.
[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:10.660]  I'm just so focused on the mission, but to be able to get out the truth to 16 million
[3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:12.680]  people about what's happening was amazing.
[3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:16.520]  I want to go to Forest and Lauren and Gabriel and Joe and many others.
[3:10:16.520 --> 3:10:18.560]  We're going to get to you quickly.
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:23.440]  We've got DrCarly.com, that's her website, DrCarly.com, Rebecca Carly.
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:24.440]  She is a surgeon.
[3:10:24.440 --> 3:10:26.320]  She is a medical doctor.
[3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:28.760]  Her son was given vaccines and got brain damage from it.
[3:10:28.760 --> 3:10:29.760]  That woke her up.
[3:10:29.760 --> 3:10:30.760]  She went down the rabbit hole.
[3:10:30.760 --> 3:10:34.840]  There's big organizations now of doctors that have been damaged, their children damaged
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:36.720]  by this, that are now fighting it.
[3:10:36.720 --> 3:10:39.240]  But last time she was on, just a month ago, she was saying, I think they're going to launch
[3:10:39.240 --> 3:10:42.920]  bird flu and I could see them gearing up for it and all the preparations and the vaccines
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:43.920]  are bio weapons.
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:47.760]  And I thought, you know, we need to get her on for her perspective, watching this and
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:48.960]  seeing what's going on.
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:54.000]  You know, we just had somebody who's really a virologist, Dr. Diggle did a lot of research
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  in that.
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:59.220]  And Google his name and see him back in the 90s in news articles, you know, in programs
[3:10:59.220 --> 3:11:00.720]  and research.
[3:11:00.720 --> 3:11:05.120]  But it's good to have Dr. Rebecca Carly on with us today to take your calls.
[3:11:05.120 --> 3:11:08.000]  DrCarly, I have no idea what your view is on this.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:11.880]  We've got you on here to get different perspectives kind of in this think tank environment we're
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:12.880]  in.
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:17.720]  For everybody listening at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com, the AM and FM listeners in
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:23.600]  places like Chicago and Miami and the Bay Area into San Francisco, for people listening
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:28.800]  all over the world on shortwave and satellite right now, what do you think's going on?
[3:11:28.800 --> 3:11:31.960]  Well, thank you very much for inviting me on again, Alex.
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:36.160]  And there's no question in my mind that this is an intentional release.
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:41.400]  And I was listening to you earlier as you were talking about how this is now a distraction
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:47.320]  from the investigation into the Bush administration's torture commands.
[3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:51.520]  And isn't that convenient that now everybody's forgetting about, you know, what we should
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:56.400]  be having now in this country, a version of the Nuremberg war trials.
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:12:01.080]  Now instead, we're all focused on this emerging pandemic and just the fact that it's got
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:07.120]  all these different particles in it from bird and human and swine.
[3:12:07.120 --> 3:12:08.400]  Where else could this have been made?
[3:12:08.400 --> 3:12:12.720]  It's not even in the laboratory itself, evident in my opinion.
[3:12:12.720 --> 3:12:14.920]  And then it's not even in the regular flu season.
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:17.960]  They all, the real flu's come from east to west.
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:21.240]  In the few other cases, it originates in North America on US military bases.
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:26.920]  The last two swine flu outbreaks, 1918, 1976, then the vaccines result in all those deaths.
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:27.920]  That's not even debated.
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:30.120]  That's in the encyclopedia Britannica.
[3:12:30.120 --> 3:12:36.080]  And then you, how do you see it killing all these people in Mexico, but not killing people
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:37.080]  here yet?
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:42.200]  And it's killing healthy people in an areas that aren't overcrowded in disease like Mexico's
[3:12:42.200 --> 3:12:43.200]  city.
[3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:46.960]  I mean, what, what makes you think this is a controlled bio weapon relation?
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:49.360]  Where does your gut, Dr. Carly, tell you this is going?
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:53.800]  Well, because they've been telling us for how many years now, at least a few years,
[3:12:53.800 --> 3:12:56.120]  it's not a matter of if, but when.
[3:12:56.120 --> 3:12:59.280]  And they've been stockpiling bird flu vaccines.
[3:12:59.280 --> 3:13:04.040]  As we talked about in the last show of years that I was on this Baxter release of the bird
[3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:09.240]  flu virus, combined with the human virus, I think that was their intention was to go
[3:13:09.240 --> 3:13:10.880]  the bird flu route.
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:15.440]  But even though the mainstream media blacked out that information from this country, there's
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:18.200]  too many shows such as yours that covered it.
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:20.120]  So they had to, you know, go to plan B.
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:21.640]  And by the way, I'm going to interrupt you.
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:26.320]  I now just remembered exactly what you said last time you were on about a month ago.
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:29.800]  In fact, somebody left their listing on a pull up, but I did two interviews with her
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:32.960]  the last few months, the last one about a month ago, maybe Dr. Carly, you've got the
[3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:37.080]  date or get, get Rob do to give me the date she was on so people can find it easy.
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:39.520]  You said, I believe it's already been released.
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:43.640]  I believe we're going to see a pandemic or at least a big scare out of this because they
[3:13:43.640 --> 3:13:47.560]  admitted they mixed it with 18 different countries, vaccines, live bird flu.
[3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:51.760]  Then suddenly people were dying that were in government care and people were getting
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:56.520]  arrested saying they were ordered by unnamed pharmaceutical companies to inject people
[3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:01.200]  with this, even though they knew it was deadly, but then the big pharma doesn't get in trouble.
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:02.680]  You said they were launching it.
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:07.600]  You unequivocally said this is it a month ago.
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:10.480]  How did you know that?
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:14.400]  Because I've been following these minions forever and I know what they're up to.
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:22.160]  The Centers for Disease Creation, we have 1088 level three bio warfare labs in this country.
[3:14:22.160 --> 3:14:25.320]  They are making these viruses and as a matter of fact, I just want to mention I've been
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:31.520]  monitoring the mainstream media to see what's going on and yesterday they had a news conference
[3:14:31.520 --> 3:14:37.280]  with a bunch of talking heads from the CDC, et cetera, on Fox and a question was asked
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:38.780]  by a reporter.
[3:14:38.780 --> 3:14:42.040]  How do we know that this was not a bio weapon attack?
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:48.360]  And immediately Fox News ended the news conference and they brought it back to one of their talking
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:50.920]  head journalists and he changed the subject.
[3:14:50.920 --> 3:14:55.560]  Now that's the question people should be asking since they've been warning us, oh, Saddam had
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.640]  weapons of mass destruction, oh, we've been all scared about this possible bio weapon
[3:14:59.640 --> 3:15:02.920]  attack that any of these terrorists could launch on us.
[3:15:02.920 --> 3:15:05.800]  How come nobody's asking that question?
[3:15:05.800 --> 3:15:11.640]  By the way, you were on March 12th and we need to go pull that clip when you said I
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:15.040]  believe they've launched the attack and then I went and listened to some other interviews
[3:15:15.040 --> 3:15:18.080]  with you and some shows you've done and you weren't normal that alarmist.
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:22.640]  I was like, wow, she was serious, really shook me.
[3:15:22.640 --> 3:15:26.720]  And I started saying I believe that this was in the cards.
[3:15:26.720 --> 3:15:30.800]  So I agree with you and I'm just having you back on remembering what you said.
[3:15:30.800 --> 3:15:35.280]  Well, if I could just comment, I don't consider myself alarmist.
[3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:38.360]  Unfortunately, the truth is very ugly at this point.
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:40.640]  But what I tell people is don't be afraid.
[3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:45.120]  The main thing you need to do is not allow them to inject you with a vaccination.
[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:51.080]  And I heard you talking before with Dr. Deagle, there's many natural things that you can do
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:52.080]  to protect yourself.
[3:15:52.080 --> 3:15:57.800]  As a matter of fact, you can put colloidal silver in it, breathe in the silver vapor
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:16:01.520]  and direct it directly to your lungs and that will help protect you.
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:07.560]  So it's not a matter of being alarmist, it's a matter of waking up and realizing our taxes
[3:16:07.560 --> 3:16:12.760]  for this genocidal agenda that they publish right on the Georgia guide stones.
[3:16:12.760 --> 3:16:17.040]  They want to decrease the world population to 500 million and it's happening right now
[3:16:17.040 --> 3:16:18.040]  before our eyes.
[3:16:18.040 --> 3:16:22.000]  We have to see it so that we can protect our family.
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:24.120]  Let's go ahead and play this clip I've been talking about all day.
[3:16:24.120 --> 3:16:26.640]  It's up on infowars.com and prisonpunna.com.
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:35.880]  This is CNN last night with a top general, let me just pull up, I forget the pronunciation
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:42.120]  of his name, it's got a French mark on the last letter, how do you pronounce it?
[3:16:42.120 --> 3:16:43.120]  Bonnery.
[3:16:43.120 --> 3:16:47.120]  Yeah, this is General Bonnery, what a three-star general retired saying we need to look at
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:16:49.520]  this being made in the lab.
[3:16:49.520 --> 3:16:52.640]  Let's go ahead and play that audio John.
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:57.600]  But you know the key question we've got to ask is we think it came from Mexico, that
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:00.240]  is the conventional wisdom of both folks.
[3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:05.920]  The next question is how did it start in Mexico, where did it emanate from, we've been able
[3:17:05.920 --> 3:17:09.480]  to find that out in all previous pandemics.
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:16.200]  The question now is to get at the heart of how did this start, did it start from the
[3:17:16.200 --> 3:17:22.720]  occasion of viruses come together, or did it come out of a lab, I mean all those questions
[3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:28.040]  have to be answered.
[3:17:28.040 --> 3:17:31.280]  Studying this and interviewing literally scores of virologists and doctors and researchers
[3:17:31.280 --> 3:17:38.080]  over the years, they're all saying this is telltale, designer virus, a lab virus and
[3:17:38.080 --> 3:17:41.200]  they're calling it a swine flu and that's only a very small part of it.
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:47.640]  Well, I totally agree with you and what I encourage your listeners to do is go to pbs.org,
[3:17:47.640 --> 3:17:54.120]  the Propaganda Broadcasting Station, and get the DVD killer flu, where they actually
[3:17:54.120 --> 3:17:59.000]  talk about how they dug up the dead bodies in Alaska so that they could deconstruct
[3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:03.240]  the virus that they called the 1918 Spanish flu.
[3:18:03.240 --> 3:18:11.040]  And it's admitted right on this DVD, this Jeffrey Toffenberger said, and I quote, if
[3:18:11.040 --> 3:18:17.120]  we can shed light on why the 1918 virus was so lethal and understand the genetic basis
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:25.360]  of that, that info can be applied to the emergence of new influenza strains.
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:30.160]  Now what does that mean applied to the emergence of new influenza strains?
[3:18:30.160 --> 3:18:35.920]  If you read between the lines, it means we can take that virus and combine it with others
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:38.920]  and emerge a new killer virus and that's what they're doing.
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:43.360]  Well, they admit that the cover for the huge bio weapons program that's 100 years old in
[3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:49.040]  this nation has been, quote, research for cures.
[3:18:49.040 --> 3:18:55.720]  And if anybody just Googles bio warfare, ancient bio warfare, you'll get all the university
[3:18:55.720 --> 3:19:01.680]  text and books that have been written on it with the Greeks, you know, 3,500 years ago
[3:19:01.680 --> 3:19:08.200]  and the Hittites 4,000 years ago and the Egyptians 3,000 years ago and the Romans 2,000 years
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:15.320]  ago and in the Middle Ages and the Mongols in China using bio weapons on their enemies.
[3:19:15.320 --> 3:19:19.800]  And then today the public's like, oh, there's those things as bio weapons from governments.
[3:19:19.800 --> 3:19:21.520]  It's only little men in caves.
[3:19:21.520 --> 3:19:25.920]  And then the last big bio attack we had in 2001, the anthrax attacks in the White House
[3:19:25.920 --> 3:19:28.200]  admits they were on Cypro to fight it.
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:31.360]  Three weeks before it popped up, it turned out to be the most weaponized version of anthrax
[3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:36.760]  ever seen to the certified patented U.S. government for Dietrich Maryland variant.
[3:19:36.760 --> 3:19:40.440]  So they just have the M.O., the history, the past, they get the gain out of it, get the
[3:19:40.440 --> 3:19:42.480]  power, these vaccine companies.
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:46.680]  Dr. Carly, let's talk about where you see all this going when we get back as we track
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:48.880]  the latest developments and information.
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:51.840]  We're trying to confirm right now at Press TV saying the World Health Organization is
[3:19:51.840 --> 3:19:53.640]  set to raise the swine for the alert.
[3:19:53.640 --> 3:19:58.360]  The level five, that's forced inoculations in martial law.
[3:19:58.360 --> 3:20:03.400]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[3:20:03.400 --> 3:20:05.440]  may not be fully detected by you.
[3:20:05.440 --> 3:20:10.680]  But the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation
[3:20:10.680 --> 3:20:15.680]  and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:20:15.680 --> 3:20:20.200]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:21.200]  across America.
[3:20:21.200 --> 3:20:25.160]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[3:20:25.160 --> 3:20:28.840]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[3:20:28.840 --> 3:20:29.840]  healthier I feel.
[3:20:29.840 --> 3:20:32.520]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[3:20:32.520 --> 3:20:37.760]  Maybe over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[3:20:37.760 --> 3:20:40.280]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:04.400]  On the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:08.920]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:21:08.920 --> 3:21:10.240]  us would like to see.
[3:21:10.240 --> 3:21:15.400]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:16.800]  of the American people.
[3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:21.160]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:21:21.160 --> 3:21:26.280]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:34.360]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[3:21:34.360 --> 3:21:37.920]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[3:21:37.920 --> 3:21:44.840]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:58.200]  half dollar.
[3:22:58.200 --> 3:23:01.480]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[3:23:01.480 --> 3:23:05.160]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[3:23:05.160 --> 3:23:06.160]  world.
[3:23:06.160 --> 3:23:11.080]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver who
[3:23:11.080 --> 3:23:16.000]  offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:17.560]  or saline solutions.
[3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:22.120]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized
[3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:26.800]  at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day
[3:23:26.800 --> 3:23:28.480]  antibiotics.
[3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:33.000]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold and copper

[3:23:40.600 --> 3:23:44.480]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:57.680]  and take it like a fool, let's go ahead and talk as far as in Texas, as far as you're
[3:24:57.680 --> 3:24:58.680]  on the air.
[3:24:58.680 --> 3:24:59.680]  Welcome.
[3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:00.680]  Howdy, Alex.
[3:25:00.680 --> 3:25:01.680]  Great to be on your show.
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:02.680]  Good to talk to you.
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:03.680]  Yeah.
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:06.680]  Well done last night on the Coast Coast AM.
[3:25:06.680 --> 3:25:10.720]  It was great how you and Steve Quayle brought up all the documented evidence and putting
[3:25:10.720 --> 3:25:15.120]  all the pieces together, how it's all interconnected, what's going on and when and where and how
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:16.400]  and why it's all going on.
[3:25:16.400 --> 3:25:20.920]  Now that was a fast-paced show, I mean, me and Steve were like piranhas with the information.
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:21.920]  Absolutely.
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:30.960]  Now, yes, this bioengineered vaccine flu, I mean, things that's been going on, well,
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:35.320]  it's taken people's minds off of all the other bad news.
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:40.680]  Now at the same time, our only choice is to have these tough times making us stronger,
[3:25:40.680 --> 3:25:46.360]  so to forgive past friends and neighbors and relatives and to show unconditional love and
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:50.960]  love and to get over all these things of the world.
[3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:55.960]  People release hormones as the doctor can attest under stress, women don't feel good
[3:25:55.960 --> 3:26:00.360]  about themselves, men are trying to, people are insecure, it's really a depressing thing.
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:04.960]  Need to feel good, feel happy, that boosts the immune system, need to get plenty of sleep.
[3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:12.360]  Dr. Carly as an MD, can you give folks some advice on ways to boost their immune system,
[3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:16.880]  I mean, get sleep, all of oregano, what do you say from your research?
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:22.680]  Well, there's never been a more important time to detoxify yourself and I do consult
[3:26:22.680 --> 3:26:26.880]  for people to teach them how to do that on an individual level, but now's the time to
[3:26:26.880 --> 3:26:31.640]  make sure you have access to organic food that is critically important, good water,
[3:26:31.640 --> 3:26:35.880]  stay away from the white coats and all of their drugs because all of these drugs have
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:40.080]  psychiatric side effects and that's something that people don't realize.
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:45.360]  You were talking with Dr. Deagle about the psychiatric effects of Tamiflu earlier, people
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:49.920]  are under mind control as well from Tell Life Vision, there's so many ways that they're
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:50.920]  bringing us down.
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:58.520]  By the way, they admit Tamiflu has a hallucinogenic and then of course cops go crazy and kids
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:03.680]  go crazy and they're going to have cops out on the force on this stuff preemptively so
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:07.280]  they quote don't get it and they're going to wonder, this is going to be bad.
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:13.600]  Yes, as a matter of fact, I have the Physician's Desk Reference right in front of me 2009 edition.
[3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:18.920]  The psychiatric side effects of Tamiflu are delirium including symptoms such as altered
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:24.880]  levels of consciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation,
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:27.360]  anxiety and nightmares.
[3:27:27.360 --> 3:27:31.200]  So this is the drug they're trying to tell us that we should take and one thing I just
[3:27:31.200 --> 3:27:34.680]  want to mention, Alex, I haven't heard any of the other guests you've had on the show
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:41.120]  before ask a question about, what is the vaccine history of all of these people that are getting
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:43.200]  this strange flu?
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:47.320]  Were those people in Mexico given some kind of regular flu vaccine?
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:51.520]  Were these travelers, they're telling us that all these travelers from the states that
[3:27:51.520 --> 3:27:56.280]  now have this virus that they all went to Mexico, were they told to get a vaccine to
[3:27:56.280 --> 3:27:57.280]  go to Mexico?
[3:27:57.280 --> 3:27:59.600]  Well, let me expand on that.
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:07.200]  The last two big swine flu outbreaks, 76 and 18, as you know on record, they admit this,
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:14.000]  were triggered by vaccines and at military basis, so that's the first thing we should
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  be asking.
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:20.520]  Yes, and one other thing I just want to inform the listeners, there's something called liposomes
[3:28:20.520 --> 3:28:24.520]  that they can make vaccines out of and I found out about this from my medical dictionary,
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:26.760]  there's a term lipovaccine.
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:32.120]  They can actually take a little shell of lipid and they can put things into that for delayed
[3:28:32.120 --> 3:28:35.440]  introduction of the antigen into the body.
[3:28:35.440 --> 3:28:40.880]  So there's a very good possibility that they, they timed this all out, that they could give
[3:28:40.880 --> 3:28:46.560]  people lipovaccines with a time-release element to it to deliver the antigen to the person.
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:51.400]  Isn't that associated from research with that type of wasp that goes and injects a type
[3:28:51.400 --> 3:28:59.760]  of virus that is slow delayed for after it's, after it's larvae hatches out in the caterpillar?
[3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:05.080]  Yes, and if you go to my website, you can see a political cartoon of a white-coated mosquito.
[3:29:05.080 --> 3:29:06.920]  I mean, basically that's what they're doing.
[3:29:06.920 --> 3:29:12.000]  So what I suspect is that this was all timed, as I said before, I think they were planning
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:17.440]  on calling it a bird flu pandemic, but because of the Baxter faux pas, they had to change
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:21.920]  it now to a combo virus, and I suspect what they're probably going to do, because I've
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:26.920]  done many shows on this with Dr. Diegel and Dr. Ott, they already have millions of doses
[3:29:26.920 --> 3:29:29.280]  of the bird flu vaccine stockpiled.
[3:29:29.280 --> 3:29:33.760]  What I suspect they'll do is just change the label, stick on another label and just give
[3:29:33.760 --> 3:29:34.760]  that as well.
[3:29:34.760 --> 3:29:35.760]  And that's what's going to kill more people.
[3:29:35.760 --> 3:29:37.160]  Well, they've been caught doing that.
[3:29:37.160 --> 3:29:41.120]  I mean, the last six years, it hadn't even been the right flu vaccine they come up with,
[3:29:41.120 --> 3:29:44.680]  but then people still line up and take it, then of course have their seizures and die
[3:29:44.680 --> 3:29:57.960]  right back.
[3:29:57.960 --> 3:30:01.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[3:30:01.000 --> 3:30:06.640]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[3:30:06.640 --> 3:30:11.200]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[3:30:11.200 --> 3:30:12.200]  are synthetic.
[3:30:12.200 --> 3:30:13.600]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:17.280]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[3:30:17.280 --> 3:30:21.760]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[3:30:21.760 --> 3:30:22.760]  and mucous membranes.
[3:30:22.760 --> 3:30:28.520]  Now, compare Calben Pure Soap, all natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal
[3:30:28.520 --> 3:30:33.560]  testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products

[3:30:58.160 --> 3:31:03.560]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:31:03.560 --> 3:31:09.560]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[3:31:09.560 --> 3:31:11.560]  just as well-funded.
[3:31:11.560 --> 3:31:16.680]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:18.200]  of the American people.
[3:31:18.200 --> 3:31:22.600]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:31:22.600 --> 3:31:27.680]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:31:27.680 --> 3:31:34.200]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:31:34.200 --> 3:31:37.760]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.

[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:42.400]  This is Justin.
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:43.400]  It's up on infowars.com.
[3:33:43.400 --> 3:33:44.400]  Kurt Nemo.
[3:33:44.400 --> 3:33:45.400]  Just send it to me.
[3:33:45.400 --> 3:33:46.400]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[3:33:46.400 --> 3:33:57.200]  They did a bad, bad thing because if this thing is person-to-person like they say it
[3:33:57.200 --> 3:34:07.720]  is and it appears they are covering up just how many people are really sick and in trouble.
[3:34:07.720 --> 3:34:11.200]  We've said that if it starts killing people in the U.S. the way it's wildly spreading,
[3:34:11.200 --> 3:34:12.640]  then we've got a problem.
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:18.040]  Two L.A. County deaths possible related to swine flu coroner says, but that's good news.
[3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:21.440]  They're not confirming it's from swine flu, but maybe it's a cover-up.
[3:34:21.440 --> 3:34:22.440]  Maybe it's hype.
[3:34:22.440 --> 3:34:24.400]  You don't know the lying criminal government.
[3:34:24.400 --> 3:34:28.440]  The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office is investigating two recent deaths that officials
[3:34:28.440 --> 3:34:31.320]  say can be related to the recent global swine flu outbreak.
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:34.600]  However, no tests have come back positive for the swine flu.
[3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:36.320]  Well, why are they saying this?
[3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:40.480]  And medical examiners have not officially determined the cause of the deaths.
[3:34:40.480 --> 3:34:45.800]  Update, 9.30 a.m. Coroner Spokesman Craig Harvey said his office will collect specimens
[3:34:45.800 --> 3:34:49.000]  from the deceased and send them to the county public department.
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  Are they Hispanic?
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:54.920]  Because if it's in, this is really going to be a race specific if it only is killing
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:34:59.640]  Hispanics, which was determined whether either person died from the swine flu.
[3:34:59.640 --> 3:35:05.800]  If so, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be notified, Harvey said.
[3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:13.160]  Coroner Spokesman Craig Harvey said Bell Flower Medical Center reported the death, 33-year-old
[3:35:13.160 --> 3:35:20.400]  Long Beach resident Monday afternoon, from symptoms resembling swine flu.
[3:35:20.400 --> 3:35:26.840]  The man was taken to the hospital Saturday, complaining of shortness of breath and lymphoma.
[3:35:26.840 --> 3:35:33.080]  Whatever that means, doctors later diagnosed the patient with pneumonia, Harvey said.
[3:35:33.080 --> 3:35:37.080]  And now somebody else's died, but doesn't say who.
[3:35:37.080 --> 3:35:38.080]  The man died April 22nd.
[3:35:38.080 --> 3:35:41.080]  Let me go ahead and print that for me, guys.
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:44.480]  Let me go ahead and give this other one here, and he sent me another one.
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:48.360]  Oh, boy, we'll continue to track that as it unfolds.
[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:53.160]  Lauren in Colorado, you're on the air with our guest, Dr. Rebecca Carly.
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:35:55.000]  Hello, can you hear me?
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  Yes, I can.
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  Okay, good deal.
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:02.600]  Praise be to the master intelligence of the universe for letting me be able to speak to
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:06.600]  and praise to you and your good work, Alex.
[3:36:06.600 --> 3:36:12.480]  What I wanted to talk about here was, these are my own opinions because I'm not a medical
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:17.600]  professional, but I have studied virology to a certain degree.
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:26.640]  And I think everybody needs to be very concerned about taking any kind of enforced vaccinations.
[3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:36.320]  The reason for that is that basically the strain that's going around is showing to have
[3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:40.440]  an extremely good transmissivity.
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:50.200]  And if, by chance, there is a H5N1 virus in these vaccinations, well, then the person
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:56.400]  getting vaccinated is infected with the current strain, anybody that goes into the hospital
[3:36:56.400 --> 3:37:00.600]  and they say, well, let's give you this shot to make you feel better, they're infected
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:07.760]  with the current strain and then they get infected with the highly lethal H5N1 strain.
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:14.120]  Well, through genetic re-assortment, which is where the genes of the virus swap, that's
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:18.760]  probably the fastest way possible to get this out of your brain.
[3:37:18.760 --> 3:37:21.680]  That's what the scientists and doctors in the Czech Republic were saying when they caught
[3:37:21.680 --> 3:37:30.080]  a Baxter, excuse me, Barry does the same stuff, mixing live bird flu weaponized with the regular
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:33.480]  vaccine was that was the perfect way to mutate it, then have it injected in the body would
[3:37:33.480 --> 3:37:38.720]  mutate again, they are saying the Tamiflu causes it to mutate.
[3:37:38.720 --> 3:37:42.320]  And well, Dr. Rebecca Carly, do you want to comment on that?
[3:37:42.320 --> 3:37:49.440]  Well, first of all, nobody should be taking any vaccine, I encourage the caller to go
[3:37:49.440 --> 3:37:55.640]  to my website, drcarly.com, read some of my documents, especially the document science
[3:37:55.640 --> 3:38:00.840]  of vaccine damage, vaccines don't just give you the infection, they cause a corruption
[3:38:00.840 --> 3:38:05.840]  in your immune system that leads to all autoimmune disease, non-traumatic seizures, cancer and
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:08.400]  genetic damage in people and in pets.
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:12.520]  These vaccines have the potential to cause the extinction of humanity.
[3:38:12.520 --> 3:38:17.320]  This is how serious this insane practice of vaccination is, which is nothing more than
[3:38:17.320 --> 3:38:18.320]  medical voodoo.
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:23.160]  So vaccines do not protect you, they give you the infection, and even if they tell you
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:29.000]  that the virus is quote unquote attenuated, meaning that it's allegedly made less pathogenic
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:34.080]  by passing it through different tissue cultures, that's how they get these viruses to combine
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:36.760]  with viruses and other tissue cultures.
[3:38:36.760 --> 3:38:41.120]  And these things can reactivate themselves if you have any kind of virus in your body
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:47.040]  and you're injected with a vaccine, just as the caller was saying, these viruses re-assort
[3:38:47.040 --> 3:38:53.040]  with each other, they combine DNA, they produce new mutants, and this has the potential of
[3:38:53.040 --> 3:38:54.720]  causing a huge problem.
[3:38:54.720 --> 3:38:57.520]  Okay, Lauren, thank you for the call, go ahead doctor.
[3:38:57.520 --> 3:39:02.400]  Yeah, and that's why what I'm trying to get people to realize is the whole vaccine situation
[3:39:02.400 --> 3:39:07.400]  is a scam on its face, and that is what's going to cause all the deaths.
[3:39:07.400 --> 3:39:12.120]  I encourage the listeners to check out a book, Vaccination to Silent Killer, A Clear and
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:18.200]  Present Danger, by Ida Honoroff and Eleanor McBean, they talk about the 1918 Spanish flu
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:21.000]  pandemic, which was caused by inoculations-
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:27.040]  Hey, Ron Paul in 76 as a doctor was in a book exposing the swine flu, saying it's a premeditated
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:33.160]  scam to take control of society, to sell vaccines, it's a fraud, it's the vaccines that are hurting
[3:39:33.160 --> 3:39:34.160]  you.
[3:39:34.160 --> 3:39:35.640]  Let me give folks some new developments here.
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:41.320]  New York City Health Commissioner, this is Fox News, many hundreds of school students
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:43.040]  sick with suspected swine flu.
[3:39:43.040 --> 3:39:48.640]  We knew this last night from We Are Changers, who have girlfriends and things that are in
[3:39:48.640 --> 3:39:52.000]  college, where they're saying everybody's basically sick.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:56.440]  The calls we're getting from Mexico, from doctors and others are saying 70% of people
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:39:57.440]  are sick.
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:39:59.920]  I mean, if you can believe that, that is just unbelievable.
[3:39:59.920 --> 3:40:03.800]  City Health Commissioner Thomas Friedman also said Tuesday that many hundreds of school
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:07.880]  children who are sick with suspected cases of swine flu, Bloomberg says the hospitalizations
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:11.520]  are separate from the outbreak of the private school in Queens.
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:14.800]  We know somebody at the Queens Hospital, it's in hospital from that.
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:20.800]  The mayor says he hospitalized our children in the Bronx and an adult in Brooklyn.
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:23.240]  Notice it's always the government training camp where this happens.
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:28.160]  And you notice nationwide, all the quote kids, they get their federal funds who hadn't
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:31.000]  been vaccinated, they've been vaccinating the last two weeks.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:35.840]  I bet our bottom dollar, it'll come out in a week or two when nobody's paying attention
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:37.440]  that the vaccines have triggered this.
[3:40:37.440 --> 3:40:38.440]  It's always the same.
[3:40:38.440 --> 3:40:39.440]  Exactly.
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:43.160]  And I just want to say, I have CNN on the background right now.
[3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:49.600]  We have this minion on the Palo Tano on CNN now, reassuring people that there's no chance
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:51.840]  that this could possibly be coming from pigs.
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:40:57.000]  Now, I want people to also realize that all of the food source animals are inoculated,
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:40:59.200]  even farm raised fish, okay?
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:03.960]  So here she is on television telling people there's no way that the food products could
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:04.960]  be causing this.
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:06.320]  How do they know that?
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:08.500]  She's on the tell live vision.
[3:41:08.500 --> 3:41:13.240]  You should believe the tell live vision, speak of the tell live vision, punch up, punch
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:17.360]  up CNN real quick for us, the propaganda channel or C-SPAN, I'll have it.
[3:41:17.360 --> 3:41:18.960]  But again, more cases there.
[3:41:18.960 --> 3:41:23.440]  Here's another one, Rio Grande City School closed due to swine flu.
[3:41:23.440 --> 3:41:26.280]  What's that guys?
[3:41:26.280 --> 3:41:27.280]  Our cable boxes out.
[3:41:27.280 --> 3:41:28.680]  What do they do with it?
[3:41:28.680 --> 3:41:29.680]  Cookie Monster take it?
[3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:32.280]  I tell you, that satellite is the creditiest.
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:34.520]  We can't get cable or my offices.
[3:41:34.520 --> 3:41:36.040]  These satellites are real pieces of junk.
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:37.040]  I just want that on record.
[3:41:37.040 --> 3:41:43.520]  It says retired Army General Russell, honorary on CNN, again, the swine flu come from lab,
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:48.440]  Los Angeles probe two possible deaths from swine flu.
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:49.440]  This is really getting insane.
[3:41:49.440 --> 3:41:50.440]  Okay.
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:51.920]  Let's take another call here.
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:54.040]  Gabriel in New York.
[3:41:54.040 --> 3:41:55.040]  Go ahead.
[3:41:55.040 --> 3:41:59.920]  Hey Alex Jones, this is Gabriel Brown from Long Island, New York looking at checkerboards
[3:41:59.920 --> 3:42:02.600]  in the sky of these chemtrails, but I wanted to give a...
[3:42:02.600 --> 3:42:07.800]  That's better than Air Force One and the F-16s, screaming between the buildings yesterday for
[3:42:07.800 --> 3:42:09.160]  a quote, photo op.
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:10.160]  Go ahead.
[3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:15.640]  I think that the comments that Joe Biden made months ago might be interesting because
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:18.840]  he said international incident, which is what we're seeing now.
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:25.320]  Of course, you get the chemtrails, which are making our immune system go down.
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:30.560]  You got, of course, the marketing between the TV and Big Pharma, the fact that, I mean,
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:34.320]  look at the 1980s with the correct cocaine epidemic.
[3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:35.320]  Yeah.
[3:42:35.320 --> 3:42:37.320]  The CIA admits they ship that in.
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:39.960]  Again, it's just everything criminal comes from this elite.
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.640]  It's just unbelievable how bad they are.
[3:42:41.640 --> 3:42:42.640]  Yeah.
[3:42:42.640 --> 3:42:47.440]  The martial law plans, which you've been calling a show for the last three years, and the mass
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:48.440]  graves.
[3:42:48.440 --> 3:42:52.440]  I mean, everything you say about the elite is absolutely true.
[3:42:52.440 --> 3:42:53.720]  I've read history books.
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:56.520]  I have family members who work for all these industries.
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:42:58.600]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:00.520]  You do not lie about these people.
[3:43:00.520 --> 3:43:06.080]  I've been affected by eugenics and I'm fighting these people on every level I can.
[3:43:06.080 --> 3:43:07.080]  Me too.
[3:43:07.080 --> 3:43:08.080]  God bless you.
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:09.080]  Look, I wish this wasn't true.
[3:43:09.080 --> 3:43:12.600]  Look, I don't want to work 16, 17, 18 hours a day.
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:14.200]  I worked more than 18 yesterday.
[3:43:14.200 --> 3:43:17.840]  I worked, I worked 20 hours yesterday.
[3:43:17.840 --> 3:43:18.840]  That's not true.
[3:43:18.840 --> 3:43:21.400]  I took off for an hour and a half of my parents over at my parents with my kids over there
[3:43:21.400 --> 3:43:22.400]  for dinner.
[3:43:22.400 --> 3:43:26.120]  And I even jumped to my parents' hot tub for 20 minutes, but the point is, so I worked
[3:43:26.120 --> 3:43:29.800]  17 hours yesterday, and I want this to stop.
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:30.800]  I don't like this.
[3:43:30.800 --> 3:43:32.040]  It's not fun, but I'm dedicated.
[3:43:32.040 --> 3:43:33.240]  I know they're criminal.
[3:43:33.240 --> 3:43:34.360]  I know we've got to beat them.
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:35.360]  We have no future.
[3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:39.840]  It's like I'm in a closed container with a water level rising and I'm going, folks,
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:41.280]  I can't open the door alone.
[3:43:41.280 --> 3:43:42.280]  I need all your help.
[3:43:42.280 --> 3:43:45.200]  We need the strength to do it together and there's all these people with the water raising.
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:46.200]  That's not water.
[3:43:46.200 --> 3:43:47.200]  Hold on.
[3:43:47.200 --> 3:43:48.200]  I'm not drowning.
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:51.840]  It's kind of, uh, shut up conspiracy theorists, uh, and then, you know, it's like going above
[3:43:51.840 --> 3:43:52.840]  their head.
[3:43:52.840 --> 3:43:56.520]  Go on, help me open this door, um, thank you for the call, sir.
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:43:57.520]  God bless you.
[3:43:57.520 --> 3:43:58.520]  Any other comments?
[3:43:58.520 --> 3:43:59.520]  Yeah, sure.
[3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:00.720]  Uh, you do a great job.
[3:44:00.720 --> 3:44:05.120]  I want to give a shout out to my friend, Mike Schaper.
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:06.720]  We are changed.
[3:44:06.720 --> 3:44:10.000]  And again, I've been researching this for about 13 years now.
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:14.520]  I was woken up about three years when I came across your show by mistake for a win amp
[3:44:14.520 --> 3:44:15.520]  link.
[3:44:15.520 --> 3:44:17.280]  So keep your streams out there.
[3:44:17.280 --> 3:44:18.600]  Keep them in random places.
[3:44:18.600 --> 3:44:20.880]  People find that stuff like myself had no idea.
[3:44:20.880 --> 3:44:21.880]  No, I know.
[3:44:21.880 --> 3:44:22.880]  That's how we listen.
[3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:26.320]  AM and FM stations getting a lot more shortwave, huge audience all over the world, but our
[3:44:26.320 --> 3:44:32.240]  internet, and I appreciate your call, um, because of our different servers and platforms
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:36.800]  and the poor man's, well, you know, the way we do this, we're number one on show cast,
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:40.400]  number one talk, number one music, number one, and that's the big global aggregator
[3:44:40.400 --> 3:44:41.480]  that tracks everything.
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:42.560]  We're number one.
[3:44:42.560 --> 3:44:45.080]  And that's not even what half our streams.
[3:44:45.080 --> 3:44:51.480]  I mean, it's amazing to have, you know, 30,000 people tuning in just on the internet because
[3:44:51.480 --> 3:44:53.880]  an AM and FM audience is much bigger.
[3:44:53.880 --> 3:44:56.280]  Our AM and FM audience is probably 50 times that.
[3:44:56.280 --> 3:45:00.840]  You know, one big AM might have 30,000, 40,000 listening at one time.
[3:45:00.840 --> 3:45:04.720]  You know, Ted's actually gotten the ratings, uh, before he, uh, he's a network.
[3:45:04.720 --> 3:45:08.000]  So he bought a big aggregate of them just from our affiliates that do subscribe.
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:14.040]  You only get them from those that subscribe and, uh, 315,000 listeners for 15 minutes
[3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:19.600]  is what our AM and FM, uh, uh, QM is or whatever or, or no, it's listening at one time.
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:24.080]  I forget all the numbers, but it's 315,000 listening every, uh, every 15 minutes that
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:28.240]  our time spent listening is a lot longer than the average 18 minutes, something like an
[3:45:28.240 --> 3:45:29.240]  hour.
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:31.560]  I mean, it's just amazing, just shy of an hour.
[3:45:31.560 --> 3:45:35.600]  And so there's that, then there's shortwave internet and hundreds of thousands tune in
[3:45:35.600 --> 3:45:36.600]  on the web.
[3:45:36.600 --> 3:45:39.000]  But the cool part about the web is it's spread out.
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:43.440]  It's a small audience compared to all our other AM and FM's in shortwave, but it's
[3:45:43.440 --> 3:45:48.720]  people spread everywhere, you know, Mexico city and South Korea and Japan and Russia
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:51.800]  and Germany and Canada and everywhere.
[3:45:51.800 --> 3:45:55.080]  I mean, you know, every time there's a mass shooting at Blacksburg, we had a guy across
[3:45:55.080 --> 3:45:56.080]  the street.
[3:45:56.080 --> 3:46:00.280]  You know, as it was happening, you know, it just, whatever it is we've got the listeners.
[3:46:00.280 --> 3:46:01.280]  It's so amazing.
[3:46:01.280 --> 3:46:05.040]  Let's take another call that Rebecca Carly, uh, on the line with us.
[3:46:05.040 --> 3:46:07.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in California.
[3:46:07.760 --> 3:46:08.760]  Go ahead, Joe.
[3:46:08.760 --> 3:46:09.760]  How are you?
[3:46:09.760 --> 3:46:10.760]  Good.
[3:46:10.760 --> 3:46:11.760]  Good.
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:15.680]  Listen, uh, I have a, unfortunately my, my, my brother got caught over there, but he's
[3:46:15.680 --> 3:46:21.640]  in Cozumel, he left before this whole nonsense of the sweet, uh, the, uh, designer virus
[3:46:21.640 --> 3:46:22.640]  took place.
[3:46:22.640 --> 3:46:28.240]  And he called his folks on yesterday and basically he, um, just about an hour before he spoke
[3:46:28.240 --> 3:46:34.480]  early in the morning, um, Pacific Standard Time, the, uh, hotel employees at the resort
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:39.200]  at Cozumel were, uh, inoculated.
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:44.000]  They were required to take vaccinations because of what was going on in the mainland in Mexico.
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  Yeah, we've been confirming that that's probably what's giving it to him.
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:48.000]  Go ahead.
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:49.000]  Of course.
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  Yeah.
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:51.000]  That's number one.
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  Number two, I told my brother says, you know, he, I woke him up years ago and he said,
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:58.080]  yes, the employee, hey, can you let me know what the name of the, of the vaccine that
[3:46:58.080 --> 3:46:59.080]  they gave you?
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:01.000]  I'm interested in knowing what it was.
[3:47:01.000 --> 3:47:02.000]  So we're trying to find out.
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:03.000]  He hasn't called me.
[3:47:03.000 --> 3:47:07.240]  Secondly, you know, with all this throwing around, and I'm sure you remember this.
[3:47:07.240 --> 3:47:12.280]  I was the one that, uh, you posted my article, the author, um, the, it was entitled, uh,
[3:47:12.280 --> 3:47:14.760]  is Joe Biden, the fortune teller of terror.
[3:47:14.760 --> 3:47:20.080]  You remember his famous, um, a particular article I talked about how he quote, he said,
[3:47:20.080 --> 3:47:21.680]  mark my words, mark my words.
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:26.640]  It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama, likely, like, like they
[3:47:26.640 --> 3:47:27.640]  did JFK.
[3:47:27.640 --> 3:47:31.520]  Remember I said standing here in your room, if you did not hear anything else I said,
[3:47:31.520 --> 3:47:36.840]  watch what we are going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis to test the middle
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:37.840]  of the sky.
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:42.120]  Could it, I mean, obviously we, I first thought it was a financial crisis.
[3:47:42.120 --> 3:47:47.640]  But the way this is going to this be it, is this what Mr. Biden, you know, had for knowledge
[3:47:47.640 --> 3:47:48.640]  of?
[3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:51.600]  Uh, look, I, and that was through a group of donors.
[3:47:51.600 --> 3:47:52.800]  He didn't know that was being recorded.
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:47:55.280]  Just like when Obama said, we're going to, don't worry, we're going to get their guns.
[3:47:55.280 --> 3:47:59.880]  So these Bible clutch and gun, you know, clutching these bitter clingers.
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:02.760]  And yeah, no, no, I mean, look, my gut tells me it's staged.
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:06.080]  I just can't tell whether it's a real mega pandemic or not.
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:10.720]  But imagine the slavery of that here in the U S and in Mexico, they're just telling employees
[3:48:10.720 --> 3:48:14.320]  and medical workers and police, you got to take this shot when there's no way they've
[3:48:14.320 --> 3:48:19.480]  got a vaccine for this unless they already had released it and knew it was coming.
[3:48:19.480 --> 3:48:25.400]  Uh, uh, Dr. Carly, I mean, in every other major case, it's the vaccines that are doing
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:26.400]  this.
[3:48:26.400 --> 3:48:27.400]  This stinks to high heaven.
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:30.160]  What he's saying about his brother, and I'm familiar with your article, sir, was a great
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:31.160]  story.
[3:48:31.160 --> 3:48:35.520]  Uh, his brother in Cozumel, yes, it's self-evident.
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:38.400]  How could they possibly have a vaccine ready to go?
[3:48:38.400 --> 3:48:42.840]  The only way they could have a vaccine ready is if they made the virus in the first, first
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:45.640]  place, most likely released it through a vaccine.
[3:48:45.640 --> 3:48:51.440]  As I said, we have to find out where those victims in Mexico, Canada, wherever the United
[3:48:51.440 --> 3:48:56.600]  States who allegedly traveled to Mexico, did they get a flu vaccine before they left?
[3:48:56.600 --> 3:48:58.800]  I'm sure the answer is probably yes.
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:01.960]  And then they're telling people we have a vaccine for you to take.
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:05.000]  Just that alone should make these people start asking questions.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  Wait a minute.
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:07.240]  How could you have made a vaccine?
[3:49:07.240 --> 3:49:10.360]  And how could you have tested it to see if it was safe?
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:16.280]  As we discussed on the show last time I was on, these homeless people in Poland, many
[3:49:16.280 --> 3:49:20.240]  of them died after they were tested with this bird flu vaccine.
[3:49:20.240 --> 3:49:26.040]  So how do we know we're not just having another mass experiment right now with this vaccine?
[3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:27.040]  I agree.
[3:49:27.040 --> 3:49:31.600]  We have an article saying, how do we know this isn't another bad vaccine or by design
[3:49:31.600 --> 3:49:35.720]  and tie it into all the deaths and all the past things that have happened?
[3:49:35.720 --> 3:49:37.760]  Welcome back to Joe in California.
[3:49:37.760 --> 3:49:38.760]  Anything else, sir?
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:39.760]  Yeah.
[3:49:39.760 --> 3:49:40.760]  Yeah.
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:41.760]  One quick question, Alex.
[3:49:41.760 --> 3:49:42.760]  You're the one that posted it.
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:44.960]  And I haven't heard much about it and I listen to every day.
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:50.840]  What happened to that videoclip that you posted with regards to Dr. John Carlo, who stated
[3:49:50.840 --> 3:49:54.800]  in his press conference whether he did so intentionally or it slipped out, whichever
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:50:01.120]  the case may have been, about this so-called swine flu was cultured, quote-unquote, in
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:02.120]  the laboratory.
[3:50:02.120 --> 3:50:03.120]  No.
[3:50:03.120 --> 3:50:06.000]  It was all over the news, it's just in the archives of the site.
[3:50:06.000 --> 3:50:15.720]  I think the headline on that was that this flu is a mix, a rare mix of other viruses.
[3:50:15.720 --> 3:50:22.480]  And that was in Dallas, he was the medical examiner saying, but you can say that meant
[3:50:22.480 --> 3:50:25.920]  we've cultured it and it's this or they grew it in a lab.
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:30.440]  But now we have a general on CNN saying openly that could have been made in a lab.
[3:50:30.440 --> 3:50:35.160]  The videoclip was put up by you, I saved it and when I tried to send it to somebody
[3:50:35.160 --> 3:50:37.560]  and it had been taken off, that's why I'm bringing it up.
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:39.960]  Maybe you can just keep posting it so there's good to get it off.
[3:50:39.960 --> 3:50:44.320]  Yeah, we've got one and a half people running InfoWars, it's probably some program problem
[3:50:44.320 --> 3:50:48.240]  or something, but we'll repost that video, in fact, email Curt Naskin repost that medical
[3:50:48.240 --> 3:50:49.240]  examiner clip.
[3:50:49.240 --> 3:50:52.720]  Final segment straight ahead, stay with us, Jason Bermas tonight, nine to midnight, nine
[3:50:52.720 --> 3:50:56.920]  to midnight, Central Center time, the Info Warrior, with the one, the only, Bernie.
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:50:59.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:50:59.320 --> 3:51:03.280]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage
[3:51:03.280 --> 3:51:04.920]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[3:51:04.920 --> 3:51:08.960]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[3:51:08.960 --> 3:51:09.960]  or gold?
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:13.320]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[3:51:13.320 --> 3:51:15.480]  possible that could even happen again.
[3:51:15.480 --> 3:51:20.040]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[3:51:20.040 --> 3:51:21.040]  seeds.
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:25.960]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:27.840]  food for you and your family.
[3:51:27.840 --> 3:51:32.040]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and
[3:51:32.040 --> 3:51:35.680]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[3:51:35.680 --> 3:51:38.920]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[3:51:38.920 --> 3:51:45.720]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[3:51:45.720 --> 3:51:49.760]  That's 877-327-0365.
[3:51:49.760 --> 3:51:54.720]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[3:51:54.720 --> 3:51:58.560]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[3:51:58.560 --> 3:52:04.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:04.640 --> 3:52:09.160]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:52:09.160 --> 3:52:10.480]  us would like to see.
[3:52:10.480 --> 3:52:15.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:15.640 --> 3:52:16.880]  of the American people.
[3:52:16.880 --> 3:52:21.400]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since D1 in this election.
[3:52:21.400 --> 3:52:26.480]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:26.480 --> 3:52:34.600]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:34.600 --> 3:52:38.160]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:38.160 --> 3:52:45.080]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:45.080 --> 3:52:50.640]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in Super High
[3:52:50.640 --> 3:52:53.240]  Quality at www.prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:52:58.120]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:52:58.120 --> 3:53:02.520]  If you've always wanted to experience the amazing benefits from using oil of oregano,
[3:53:02.520 --> 3:53:04.400]  the time to act is now.
[3:53:04.400 --> 3:53:08.820]  With so many places to choose from, where can you be 100% certain you're getting the

[3:53:57.080 --> 3:54:03.480]  All right, Kelly, Roland, Matt, we're going to jam you in here right at the end, Dr.
[3:54:03.480 --> 3:54:04.480]  Rebecca Carly.
[3:54:04.480 --> 3:54:07.520]  I wanted to tell you about two quick sponsors that make this show possible that I also believe
[3:54:07.520 --> 3:54:08.520]  in.
[3:54:08.520 --> 3:54:11.000]  One of them is New Silver Solution.
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:15.360]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant new strains of idly bacteria
[3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:16.360]  and viruses?
[3:54:16.360 --> 3:54:19.680]  Maybe you've heard all these medical doctors tell you, Loyal Silver.
[3:54:19.680 --> 3:54:22.600]  Is there something that can kill bacteria that is safe and can be used on a daily or
[3:54:22.600 --> 3:54:23.600]  weekly basis?
[3:54:23.600 --> 3:54:29.480]  The New Silver Solution is a highly effective, potent nano-particulate solution that is lethal
[3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:31.040]  to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
[3:54:31.040 --> 3:54:32.880]  It is non-toxic to humans and animals.
[3:54:32.880 --> 3:54:37.920]  The New Silver Solution is patented and has been exclusively, extensively tested.

[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:20.520]  on infowars.com.

[3:55:28.280 --> 3:55:29.280]  Okay.
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:30.960]  Let's take a few final calls.
[3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:34.480]  Kelly in Virginia, then Roland, Roland of Gilead.
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:35.480]  Go ahead.
[3:55:35.480 --> 3:55:36.480]  You're on the air, Kelly.
[3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:37.480]  Hi, Alex.
[3:55:37.480 --> 3:55:38.480]  How are you?
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:43.800]  My question is, I'm standing out on my deck right now, and since I woke up this morning,
[3:55:43.800 --> 3:55:48.280]  they have been viciously spraying chemtrails over Richmond.
[3:55:48.280 --> 3:55:51.440]  Some of them are flying very low, some are flying very high.
[3:55:51.440 --> 3:55:56.920]  My question is, is there any way possible that the swine flu could be dropped via that
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:55:57.920]  way?
[3:55:57.920 --> 3:56:02.160]  Generally, they spray it at below 2,000 feet when they want to hit you, but they can spray
[3:56:02.160 --> 3:56:06.640]  and they've done government tests that are declassified thousands of miles away to hit
[3:56:06.640 --> 3:56:09.360]  a certain area of the jet stream where it dumps.
[3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:14.720]  There's only key areas where the jet stream comes down to close to sea level.
[3:56:14.720 --> 3:56:16.360]  Dr. Carly?
[3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:17.360]  I totally agree.
[3:56:17.360 --> 3:56:22.920]  They could be delivering this in many ways, but the most dangerous way is through a needle,
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:27.320]  and so that's why people have to do everything they can to get their immune system working,
[3:56:27.320 --> 3:56:31.960]  and my most important message to the listeners is do not take the vaccine no matter what
[3:56:31.960 --> 3:56:32.960]  they threaten you with.
[3:56:32.960 --> 3:56:36.480]  If enough of us just say no, what are they going to do?
[3:56:36.480 --> 3:56:40.080]  They stage a big crisis, they hype it, they try to get people to go along with what they're
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:42.960]  doing to set the precedent of their control.
[3:56:42.960 --> 3:56:46.960]  Get the word out to everybody, what's really going on in a great place is, again, this
[3:56:46.960 --> 3:56:48.800]  radio show, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:56:48.800 --> 3:56:49.800]  Thank you so much, Kelly.
[3:56:49.800 --> 3:56:52.880]  Roland in Nevada, you're on the air.
[3:56:52.880 --> 3:56:56.280]  That's kind of interesting.
[3:56:56.280 --> 3:57:02.480]  I totally forgot about the chemtrails, but yesterday, I'm here in Nevada, actually, and
[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:08.400]  I was driving out, I've noticed that they've been putting chemtrails on the west side of
[3:57:08.400 --> 3:57:09.400]  the skies.
[3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:14.400]  I thought in the last couple of months, it's been here and there, but yesterday, specifically,
[3:57:14.400 --> 3:57:20.040]  I went out in the afternoon, around 10, 11 o'clock, and chemtrails, I noticed there was
[3:57:20.040 --> 3:57:27.480]  a massive amount of them, and just to make this quick, by 6, 8 p.m., say, before sundown,
[3:57:27.480 --> 3:57:33.080]  so probably about 6 or 7, there was a massive, massive, I looked up and I said, well, I never
[3:57:33.080 --> 3:57:39.040]  saw a cloud, a tower of a cloud that high here, and it's actually not a cloud that I'm
[3:57:39.040 --> 3:57:44.800]  looking at, and I noticed a couple more planes, and it's actually completely consumed the
[3:57:44.800 --> 3:57:50.800]  valley, and it's amazing, but anyway, back to my point, Alex, I want to thank you for
[3:57:50.800 --> 3:57:52.760]  everything that you've been doing.
[3:57:52.760 --> 3:57:59.640]  I've run upon, I came across some things, I know a lot of Bible readers listen to your
[3:57:59.640 --> 3:58:06.120]  show as well, and I came across a video on YouTube, this guy was basically breaking down
[3:58:06.120 --> 3:58:07.120]  the scriptures of the Bible.
[3:58:07.120 --> 3:58:10.680]  Hey, tell us the video, because the show's over.
[3:58:10.680 --> 3:58:12.200]  Tell us the video, the show's over.
[3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:14.720]  Oh, man, I wish I had a link for you.
[3:58:14.720 --> 3:58:15.720]  Okay, listen, we're out of time.
[3:58:15.720 --> 3:58:16.720]  Call me back tomorrow.
[3:58:16.720 --> 3:58:19.880]  I want to thank Dr. Carly for joining us, the website's drcarly.com.
[3:58:19.880 --> 3:58:25.080]  We'll talk to you again soon as this develops, we're preparing for the worst, and I'm hoping
[3:58:25.080 --> 3:58:26.080]  for the best here.
[3:58:26.080 --> 3:58:27.080]  Thank you so much, Dr. Carly.
[3:58:27.080 --> 3:58:28.080]  Thank you, Willard.
[3:58:28.080 --> 3:58:33.960]  All right, retransmission starts now, jam-packed first hour on the streams, inform your friends
[3:58:33.960 --> 3:58:39.800]  and family that can tune in right now at the InfoWars restreams on the audio, God bless.
[3:58:39.800 --> 3:58:42.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[3:58:47.880 --> 3:58:48.880]  Hello, friends.
[3:58:48.880 --> 3:58:49.880]  It's Joe.
[3:58:49.880 --> 3:58:53.280]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[3:58:53.280 --> 3:58:54.280]  important than ever.
[3:58:54.280 --> 3:58:57.280]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[3:58:57.280 --> 3:59:00.080]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[3:59:00.080 --> 3:59:04.080]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[3:59:04.080 --> 3:59:08.000]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[3:59:08.000 --> 3:59:09.600]  the final equation between you.
[3:59:09.600 --> 3:59:14.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:14.000 --> 3:59:18.280]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the cost of
[3:59:18.280 --> 3:59:19.800]  last year's grocery prices.

[3:59:29.920 --> 3:59:31.280]  foods they have to offer.
