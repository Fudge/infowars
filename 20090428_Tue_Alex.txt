[00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.765]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:11.346]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:12.267]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:17.091]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:21.155]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:43.191]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.213]  It is Tuesday the 28th day of April 2009.
[00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.635]  We're gonna be live here for the next...
[00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:53.784]  Four hours, we have medical doctor Sherry Tinpenny joining us.
[00:00:53.784 --> 00:01:03.530]  She just got back to the United States from Mexico, basically forced out of the country in Monterey, in the city of Monterey, where she was staying at a medical conference.
[00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.992]  She's also had a practice down in Mexico.
[00:01:07.992 --> 00:01:16.297]  She'll be reporting to us on some of the things she witnessed traveling through Mexico when she left, and her medical view of what's happening and unfolding.
[00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:17.358]  Is it all hype?
[00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:19.824]  Or is there something real?
[00:01:19.824 --> 00:01:23.845]  Is there a serious threat behind all of this?
[00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:42.492]  I want to hear from you, the listeners, specifically with different angles and different news items and what you think is really going on, specifically on this issue of the bird-pig-human flu scare.
[00:01:42.492 --> 00:01:45.993]  The new mongrel flu, the new
[00:01:49.028 --> 00:02:10.188]  Designer flu that every doctor and scientist and virologist we talk to in the articles I read, even CNN's got experts on saying we gotta see if this was made in a laboratory because it has every telltale sign of that and that's why governments and scientists clearly at certain levels, at legitimate levels, and researchers and others are so concerned about this is because
[00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:12.548]  It is such a new flu.
[00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:16.769]  I mean, every new flu, every new mutation is new.
[00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.770]  But this is entirely whole cloth new.
[00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.071]  It's originating, the evidence shows, out of Mexico.
[00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:30.153]  All flus, for whatever reason, originate in the East and travel to the West.
[00:02:30.153 --> 00:02:32.533]  That is a scientific, historical fact.
[00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:35.954]  Why is this originating in Mexico?
[00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.471]  Now, when I say all, all the major yearly flus, there have been a few that haven't.
[00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:51.653]  And those have been troops being injected in biological tests at military bases in 1918 and 1976 in the United States, and that's come out on record.
[00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:54.473]  So, is it going to mutate into something deadly?
[00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.714]  Have they done the tests in laboratories and they know that?
[00:02:57.714 --> 00:02:59.414]  Is this a setup?
[00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:01.795]  Baxter Pharmaceutical involved?
[00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:12.676]  With shipping samples to 18 different countries in Europe to have it mixed with vaccines and that gets covered up.
[00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:15.097]  People are in bird flu trial tests in Europe.
[00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:17.198]  They're told it's a regular flu vaccine.
[00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:17.979]  They're paid to take it.
[00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.920]  They die.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:31.846]  All of this is extremely serious because we have to realize the mindset of the global elite, the mindset of the eugenicists running the planet, that they've done so many chemical, biological, and radiological tests on the people before.
[00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:41.092]  And that we know that killing the majority of the population is near and dear to their hearts, that we have to take all of these threats, especially when they're hyping it, seriously.
[00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:52.160]  In airports all over the world, including the United States, Mexico, Europe, with these infrared cameras looking for people that are, you know, have outward signs of fever.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.823]  School shut down all over Mexico.
[00:03:55.823 --> 00:03:57.985]  All schools in Mexico are shut down.
[00:03:57.985 --> 00:03:59.627]  That country coming to a complete standstill.
[00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:00.588]  Tourism shut down.
[00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:02.270]  They're telling people don't fly down there.
[00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:10.340]  They're telling Americans and Europeans and Canadians and other Latin Americans get out.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.822]  Which is actually the best way to spread it.
[00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.453]  And they keep saying in the media it's a worse strain, but they say it looks the same in Mexico.
[00:04:18.453 --> 00:04:19.874]  Is it race specific?
[00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:22.576]  Or is it that Mexican population has run down?
[00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:34.705]  I'm getting emails, calls from doctors, blurbs in Mexican news, that in coastal towns, small towns, clean towns, that don't have all the dioxins and poisons, people are dying in hospitals.
[00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:39.009]  Well, one thing's for sure, this will all become clearer in the hours and days and weeks to come.
[00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:41.076]  Hope for the best.
[00:04:41.076 --> 00:04:42.137]  Prepare for the worst.
[00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:42.597]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:42.597 --> 00:04:42.678]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:42.858]  Call us.
[00:04:42.858 --> 00:04:43.958]  Let us know what you know.
[00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.380]  On the other side, your calls and a bunch of gas straight ahead.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.421]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:48.521]  This is the Info Wars.
[00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:03.643]  You are a rebel, admit it.
[00:05:03.643 --> 00:05:06.606]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[00:05:06.606 --> 00:05:09.009]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.933]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:16.937]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count your real friends on one hand.
[00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:18.438]  Well, join the club.
[00:05:18.438 --> 00:05:24.641]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:29.303]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[00:05:29.303 --> 00:05:34.066]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:37.287]  Now, Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[00:05:37.287 --> 00:05:38.828]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[00:05:38.828 --> 00:05:41.669]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.571]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:07.271]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:13.155]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:19.300]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.601]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:24.063]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.063 --> 00:06:37.272]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.933]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:40.795]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:47.019]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.688 --> 00:06:55.952]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.952 --> 00:06:57.532]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.532 --> 00:06:58.713]  The people strike back!
[00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:02.690]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.652]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:07:09.652 --> 00:07:18.054]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:23.776]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:07:23.936 --> 00:07:25.796]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:28.097]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:32.498]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:34.719]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:42.361]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:44.162]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:32.115]  We got Dr. Rebecca Carley coming up, medical doctor in the last hour today.
[00:08:32.115 --> 00:08:37.337]  Dr. Diegel pops in for 30 minutes in the second hour.
[00:08:37.337 --> 00:08:44.019]  And we do have Fresh Out of Mexico coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:47.760]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny will be joining us coming up.
[00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:51.630]  Now I have all the latest news, all the latest developments here.
[00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.992]  I'm just going to mention some of this and then we'll just go directly to your calls.
[00:08:54.992 --> 00:09:03.155]  Because I want to give people a lot of time today on air to bring up different items that they've seen, that they've noticed, kind of put our collective minds together.
[00:09:03.155 --> 00:09:07.197]  But particularly people who have family in Mexico, who are in Mexico, the epicenter of this.
[00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:21.039]  We, since Saturday, have gotten confirmation after confirmation after confirmation and confirmation in the BBC, as well, of the death rates being much higher than what the media is saying.
[00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:29.822]  And that's the key, is that you have this double-speaker talking out of both sides of their mouths by the Mexican government, the U.S.
[00:09:29.822 --> 00:09:33.963]  government, European governments, the World Health Organization, the United Nations.
[00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:43.309]  On one side, the White House says we're declaring an emergency, a health emergency that we haven't done in decades.
[00:09:43.309 --> 00:09:45.572]  But this is just a formality, it's no big deal.
[00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.811]  And you have the Mexican government saying, everybody who's a foreigner, get out!
[00:09:50.811 --> 00:10:01.616]  We're shutting down all the shops, the stores, the roads, basically, the cities, the schools, events, museums, and the lockdown's intensifying.
[00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:12.120]  We're quarantining people, and we get the reports from hospitals all over the country of people vomiting, collapsing, people laying in the hallways, laying in the bathrooms, people dying in small towns.
[00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:24.062]  And then this is anecdotal evidence, but if it continues to pop up, you connect the dots, it makes a clear picture.
[00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:37.371]  Paul was in San Antonio this weekend visiting his folks 60 miles south of us with his wife and children, and his wife and his daughter are very, very sick with flu-like symptoms yesterday and today.
[00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:47.550]  We're getting reports from We Are Change members like Luke Rudowsky all over the country that they have a lot of friends that are sick.
[00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.231]  One of the We Are Change members, what, Manny?
[00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:57.157]  I talked to him last night and he knows one of the girls who's been quarantined.
[00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:09.786]  She's in the hospital and they're saying it was 80 people sick and going to the hospital out of that private school where we saw some of the first cases back on Saturday in the United States, confirmed cases.
[00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:39.091]  So, either this is all complete, total hype, and governments and vaccine makers and drug makers, like the makers of Tamiflu, are just hyping this to get more control, get more power, blot out the news cycle of Obama protecting Bush on torture, Obama continuing the wars, that was all coming to a head, the bankers stealing $12.8 trillion and counting, Mexico being on the verge of revolution,
[00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:46.798]  Obama's approval ratings in free fall, the European Union agenda stalling.
[00:11:46.798 --> 00:11:50.559]  I mean, governments need these distractions from time to time.
[00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:53.419]  And they're certainly capitalizing on it regardless.
[00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:55.740]  Or do they know something they're not telling the public?
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:04.123]  Because their actions say they think this is the most deadly thing since the Black Plague.
[00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.223]  Or since the swine flu.
[00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:11.279]  Epidemic, Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 that killed at least 40 million people.
[00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.019]  I mean, they're acting like this is the end of the world.
[00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:20.621]  But they did that too in 1976 and said everybody in America has to be vaccinated in the United States and a bunch of people died from the vaccine.
[00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:27.042]  Nobody died from the supposed bird flu or swine flu that popped up on a U.S.
[00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:30.382]  military base as it did in 1918.
[00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:33.883]  So, time will tell with all of this.
[00:12:36.578 --> 00:12:41.661]  Here's some of the headlines right now at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:47.063]  Time Magazine preps Americans for mandatory vaccinations.
[00:12:47.063 --> 00:12:53.066]  Says public should trust government when it institutes draconian measures to deal with pandemic.
[00:12:53.066 --> 00:13:02.131]  So we're seeing them engage in a preparatory program which is not uh... which is not soothing news.
[00:13:03.618 --> 00:13:05.520]  It does not calm the nerves.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.124]  Weaponizing deadly viruses, historical precedence.
[00:13:08.124 --> 00:13:10.066]  Infowars.com from Curt Nemo.
[00:13:10.066 --> 00:13:15.172]  How the CIA admits they weaponized cancer, weaponized a bunch of other types of viruses.
[00:13:15.172 --> 00:13:16.173]  We'll go over that.
[00:13:16.173 --> 00:13:19.377]  San Francisco Chronicle articles and others that he cites.
[00:13:19.377 --> 00:13:23.162]  CDC to mix avian human flu viruses and pandemic study.
[00:13:24.974 --> 00:13:34.379]  This is out of the big medical site, sidrep.umn.edu, big educational news site, university site.
[00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:44.725]  And this is back from January 14, 2004, five years ago, where they mixed and made hybrid superfluous, and then mailed it all over the world, by the way.
[00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:49.220]  There's another one, biological weapons date back to ancient Chinese.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:14:11.207]  For folks that are having trouble understanding why governments could engage in bioweapons attacks, why we see that as a possibility, though a horrible one, we're hoping that's not the case, is that the Greeks did it, the Canaanites did it, the Hittites did it, the Huns did it, the Mongols did it, the Chinese did it, the British did it in the Americas.
[00:14:12.813 --> 00:14:13.493]  And then the U.S.
[00:14:13.493 --> 00:14:14.974]  Army did it in the 1860s and 70s.
[00:14:14.974 --> 00:14:21.255]  So I want to go over that later in the show when we have time.
[00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:24.976]  Also, there's a lot of other important news like U.S.
[00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:38.840]  Regulatory Czar nominee wants net fairness doctrine openly states that he plans to restrict free speech on the internet and make you post opposing views and links in any stories by law.
[00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:47.412]  And have a 24 hour cooling off period before you can send emails to anybody criticizing the government or anybody else.
[00:14:47.412 --> 00:14:49.453]  Obama pushing treaty to ban reloading.
[00:14:49.453 --> 00:14:51.054]  This is really happening.
[00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:53.155]  Ban reloading period.
[00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:57.537]  They're going to call that explosives manufacturing and an act of terrorism.
[00:14:57.537 --> 00:14:59.958]  Larry Prats put out a Governors of America alert on this.
[00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:00.678]  I've read the treaty.
[00:15:00.678 --> 00:15:02.179]  It's actually in there.
[00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:06.961]  Notice how they tried to ban the military selling brass from spent rounds to the big
[00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:15.417]  Federal ammo and Georgia ammo and the rest of it.
[00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:19.040]  This is definitely one of the ways they're going after our Second Amendment, so we're going to do that.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.444]  That's just some of what I've got here in the stacks today.
[00:15:23.444 --> 00:15:25.906]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:15:25.906 --> 00:15:30.050]  But please, so I have a chance to get to everybody, make your point and we're going to move on quickly.
[00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.192]  Stephen Chicago, go ahead.
[00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:33.052]  Yes, Alex.
[00:15:33.052 --> 00:15:35.815]  I know you haven't been reading Der Spiegel, but it says
[00:15:36.505 --> 00:15:39.346]  Swine flu container explodes on train in Switzerland.
[00:15:39.346 --> 00:15:42.047]  You saw that, didn't you?
[00:15:42.047 --> 00:15:43.548]  No, I didn't.
[00:15:43.548 --> 00:15:44.008]  No.
[00:15:44.008 --> 00:15:45.829]  Listen, I'm talking to you right now, Steve.
[00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:47.589]  You asked me a question.
[00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:49.790]  I paused for about half a second.
[00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.611]  And then, so just hold on.
[00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:52.491]  No, I didn't see that.
[00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:54.852]  Will you give me the headline, please?
[00:15:54.852 --> 00:15:55.732]  Okay.
[00:15:55.732 --> 00:16:00.634]  It's swine flu container explodes on train.
[00:16:00.634 --> 00:16:03.095]  Evidently, it's that avian virus.
[00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:05.156]  They say it's an attenuated form
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:14.286]  And they had it packed in dry ice, and I guess the carbon dioxide built up and the thing exploded, exposing 60 passengers.
[00:16:14.286 --> 00:16:16.648]  It was just a regular passenger tragedy.
[00:16:16.648 --> 00:16:22.232]  Now that would only happen, that would only happen if it was actually a live virus.
[00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:25.194]  They wouldn't have it packed in ice, and that is huge news.
[00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:31.639]  Guys, will you Google right now, swine flu explodes on train, or Spiegel, or the most respected publications?
[00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:33.020]  I don't know.
[00:16:50.095 --> 00:17:14.475]  uh... to quote make the vaccine for this when they're tied into europe shipping a live weaponized bird flu all print for me thanks uh... shipping that all over uh... europe and then and then mislabeling it by design uh... the doctors and there's no way that could have happened to have it then mix with regular vaccine and then you have companies unnamed by the media but it's it's it's in the major news
[00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:22.379]  Telling homeless people, I'll keep repeating this, this is a key piece of the evidence, trying to put together what this means here.
[00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:27.961]  We have globalists at stage 9-11, globalists that radiate foster children and feed them pesticides and, you know, kill them.
[00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:31.083]  And that's the New York Daily News a few years ago and no one stops them.
[00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:33.444]  So, remember who these psychopaths are.
[00:17:33.444 --> 00:17:35.124]  And, sir, I wasn't trying to be rude to you, Steve.
[00:17:35.124 --> 00:17:36.705]  I was really thinking when you said that.
[00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:39.646]  A lot of things were connecting and so it was very upsetting.
[00:17:39.646 --> 00:17:45.109]  Swine flu container explodes on train when a container holding swine flu explodes on Swiss train on Monday.
[00:17:45.629 --> 00:17:47.310]  It could have led to a nightmare scenario.
[00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:53.051]  Luckily, the virus was not the mutated swine flu that has killed around 150 people in Mexico.
[00:17:53.051 --> 00:17:53.731]  I mean, what's going on?
[00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:55.772]  They just got this flu everywhere, shipping it around.
[00:17:55.772 --> 00:17:57.753]  And that was already spread to parts of Europe.
[00:17:57.753 --> 00:18:05.035]  Now, see, when Baxter first mixed the weaponized bird flu in with vaccines, and they won't say if it was shipped out or not, first they said it was harmless.
[00:18:05.035 --> 00:18:06.235]  Turned out it was a lie.
[00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:10.816]  So I don't believe for a minute that this is going on, because normally it is a lie.
[00:18:10.816 --> 00:18:12.097]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:18:12.097 --> 00:18:12.917]  What's your point on this?
[00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:17.458]  Well, then there was one other article, it was in the Tagus site.
[00:18:17.458 --> 00:18:25.780]  It said that the world discoverer of the original avian flu virus is an Albert Osterhaus, 60.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.701]  He works in the Rotterdam Erasmus University.
[00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:39.683]  And according to this interview with him, he discovered in 1997 the H5N1 bird virus and helped in the discovery of SARS.
[00:18:39.683 --> 00:18:40.303]  But he said
[00:18:40.851 --> 00:18:57.145]  That in his opinion, and this is one of the guys that's a world authority, not an American NIH or anything to do with America, but he says that in his opinion that it's a mixture of human swine and still unknown virus.
[00:18:57.145 --> 00:19:00.828]  He's not declaring it a bird.
[00:19:00.828 --> 00:19:05.132]  Yeah, so two of the elements he says fits.
[00:19:05.132 --> 00:19:08.355]  Is he being given access to the genome of the virus?
[00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:15.934]  Dad, I don't know, but it would be good to get him on a program because, as I say, his name is Albert Osterhaus.
[00:19:15.934 --> 00:19:20.116]  O-S-T-E-R-H-A-U-S.
[00:19:20.116 --> 00:19:21.597]  Albert Osterhaus.
[00:19:21.597 --> 00:19:22.757]  Let's get him, Rob.
[00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:24.098]  My producer's listening.
[00:19:24.098 --> 00:19:26.979]  Albert Osterhaus, and what university is he at?
[00:19:26.979 --> 00:19:32.462]  Erasmus E-R-A-S-M-U-S University.
[00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:35.323]  And that's in Rotterdam, Netherlands.
[00:19:35.323 --> 00:19:36.604]  Okay, guys, write this down.
[00:19:36.604 --> 00:19:38.425]  Rotterdam, Netherlands.
[00:19:40.277 --> 00:19:43.498]  Albert Osterhaus, how do you spell it?
[00:19:43.498 --> 00:19:45.319]  O-S-T-E-R.
[00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:47.099]  O-S-T-E-R.
[00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:48.420]  H-A-U-S.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.200]  H-A-U-S.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.741]  Rotterdam, Netherlands.
[00:19:50.741 --> 00:19:51.801]  Thank you so much.
[00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:53.941]  We'll look into that right now.
[00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:54.262]  Thank you.
[00:19:54.262 --> 00:19:55.402]  More calls straight ahead.
[00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:56.562]  That's why we like taking these calls.
[00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:58.363]  They bring up incredible points that we miss.
[00:20:00.694 --> 00:20:02.857]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[00:20:02.857 --> 00:20:10.006]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.

[00:21:01.152 --> 00:21:06.977]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.977 --> 00:21:14.564]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:20.710]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.111]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:25.613]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:25.613 --> 00:21:37.181]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:21:37.181 --> 00:21:38.862]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.862 --> 00:21:40.724]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.724 --> 00:21:46.948]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:23:00.137 --> 00:23:06.118]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:06.878]  Think about that.
[00:23:06.878 --> 00:23:09.999]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:23:09.999 --> 00:23:13.200]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:23.002]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.

[00:23:29.287 --> 00:23:30.468]  The choice is yours.
[00:23:30.468 --> 00:23:36.073]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:23:36.073 --> 00:23:37.093]  Choose for Health.
[00:23:37.093 --> 00:23:41.157]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[00:23:41.157 --> 00:23:43.599]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.

[00:24:04.124 --> 00:24:06.546]  We're watching every move the New World Order makes.
[00:24:06.546 --> 00:24:13.751]  There are a bunch of bioweapons-loving eugenicists openly calling for the extermination of the majority of the world population.
[00:24:13.751 --> 00:24:19.015]  The UN, the Club of Rome, the CFR.
[00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:20.256]  The majority of world leaders.
[00:24:20.256 --> 00:24:24.679]  The Royal Family of England.
[00:24:24.679 --> 00:24:27.702]  We'd be fools not to say this could be staged.
[00:24:27.702 --> 00:24:29.683]  The virus is clearly an engineered bioweapon.
[00:24:29.683 --> 00:24:33.446]  I'm going to play a CNN clip discussing that coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:35.686 --> 00:24:40.289]  And we're taking your phone calls right now.
[00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:42.551]  Let's talk to George in Oklahoma.
[00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:43.552]  George, you're on the air.
[00:24:43.552 --> 00:24:43.872]  Welcome.
[00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:49.940]  Alejandro, I'm not going to waste your time by, uh, I'm going to keep this under a minute.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.000]  I'm not going to waste your time by saying, hello, how are you, or what a great guy you are.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.282]  But the first time I heard about this bird flu, I thought about all those millions of coffins strategically located all around the United States.
[00:25:02.282 --> 00:25:11.103]  And the third, the last thing I'm going to say is, I dreamed that this was a new world operation 10 days ago, and I wrote three of my friends about it.
[00:25:11.103 --> 00:25:13.944]  So, I'm the guy that met you when you were 16 years old.
[00:25:13.944 --> 00:25:14.364]  Take it easy.
[00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:19.583]  All right, buddy, good to hear from you, George in Oklahoma.
[00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:30.206]  Yeah, it is really amazing to see all of this going on and the way they're hyping it.
[00:25:30.206 --> 00:25:35.007]  The governments are certainly using this to get all the other big issues.
[00:25:35.007 --> 00:25:42.550]  The bankers taking over, Obama supporting torture, all of those big stories that were coming to a head, now that's on the back burner.
[00:25:44.172 --> 00:25:48.374]  He's just worried about trying to survive.
[00:25:48.374 --> 00:25:50.114]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Texas.
[00:25:50.114 --> 00:25:50.975]  Robert, you're on the air.
[00:25:50.975 --> 00:25:53.716]  Alright, thanks Alex for taking my call.
[00:25:53.716 --> 00:26:03.060]  I'm going to try to blast through this real quick and I have some information regarding Steve Quayle's Orange Alert that I've seen with my own two eyes.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:12.664]  I think this operation is a complete smoke and mirrors to keep the eyes off of the real crisis, which is the economy.
[00:26:13.737 --> 00:26:21.421]  Lindsey Williams came on Dr. Monteith on the afternoon of Friday, the 17th of April here.
[00:26:21.421 --> 00:26:27.564]  And he said that General Motors was going to shut down 2000 dealerships.
[00:26:27.564 --> 00:26:37.829]  He said that General Growth Properties, which is the second largest real estate holder in the United States, filed for Chapter 11.
[00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:41.010]  And let's see here.
[00:26:46.835 --> 00:26:52.740]  I think this is just a big smoke and mirrors to take the attention away from that.
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:58.824]  He was saying that the tax receipts were down $54 billion in the last month.
[00:26:58.824 --> 00:27:01.607]  The Federal Reserve monetized $23.5 billion.
[00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:08.301]  Billion dollars in the last week from that week.
[00:27:08.301 --> 00:27:09.642]  It's more than that sir.
[00:27:09.642 --> 00:27:13.464]  I mean they are spending over a trillion and a half dollars a month.
[00:27:13.464 --> 00:27:15.045]  Obama in 105 days in office.
[00:27:17.506 --> 00:27:21.889]  And this, he'd already eclipsed this two weeks ago, but now it's even worse.
[00:27:21.889 --> 00:27:46.166]  Ninety-something days into office, or less, he had already spent more money than all presidents, all governments in the United States history before him, and at this rate, he will spend more money by, I saw this article in the Wall Street Journal like a week ago, by later this year, I think it's what, six, seven months from now, at the end of the year,
[00:27:47.248 --> 00:27:51.630]  More money than all governments have spent in the last 200 plus years combined.
[00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:59.033]  So this is... and then meanwhile he's saying he's going to balance the budget and cut the deficit in half by 2010.
[00:27:59.033 --> 00:28:02.175]  I mean, what an asinine lie.
[00:28:02.175 --> 00:28:04.016]  But again, his Kool-Aid drinkers just love it!
[00:28:04.961 --> 00:28:09.123]  So, yes, we are in just amazing times right now.
[00:28:09.123 --> 00:28:19.887]  And notice how this bird-slash-swine-slash-human superflu out of season, starting on the opposite side of the planet from where it always starts, just comes out of nowhere.
[00:28:19.887 --> 00:28:25.389]  And then you've got flu blowing up on trains in Switzerland.
[00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:31.831]  I mean, this is getting to be really crazy.
[00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:34.092]  Yeah, okay, let's see.
[00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:35.831]  I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.
[00:28:35.831 --> 00:28:36.972]  I've never called him.
[00:28:36.972 --> 00:28:37.632]  Well, it's okay.
[00:28:37.632 --> 00:28:38.232]  Finish your point.
[00:28:38.232 --> 00:28:39.373]  We're going to jump to the next person.
[00:28:39.373 --> 00:28:41.073]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:28:41.073 --> 00:28:42.574]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:28:42.574 --> 00:28:46.995]  Listen, folks, when you get on here, just be ready with your points, alright?
[00:28:46.995 --> 00:28:50.496]  And have a little bit of respect for the show and a little bit of respect for yourself, okay?
[00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:51.056]  Let's go ahead.
[00:28:51.056 --> 00:28:54.217]  Who's up next here?
[00:28:54.217 --> 00:28:55.258]  Robert in California.
[00:28:55.258 --> 00:28:55.618]  Go ahead.
[00:28:56.747 --> 00:29:00.790]  Hi Alex, I wanted to comment and tell you what's going on in San Diego.
[00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.551]  We had a case recently.
[00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:06.853]  I don't know if you've caught this on the internet.
[00:29:06.853 --> 00:29:16.460]  A seven-year-old boy over at Christ, the Cornerstone Academy in Mira Mesa, California has come down with the virus.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.422]  The county came in and shut down the school.
[00:29:20.422 --> 00:29:24.925]  It has over 200 students from pre-kindergarten through
[00:29:27.062 --> 00:29:38.144]  Yes, isn't it perfect timing?
[00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:40.205]  They're saying it's the law to take vaccines.
[00:29:40.205 --> 00:29:42.225]  We're exposing that it's not a law.
[00:29:42.225 --> 00:29:43.865]  And right on time to take... Stay there.
[00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:47.146]  We're gonna come back and discuss this.
[00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:48.546]  We're on the march.
[00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:51.066]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.066 --> 00:29:53.747]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.937 --> 00:30:02.500]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.481]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[00:30:05.481 --> 00:30:12.565]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit Shentritian.com.
[00:30:12.565 --> 00:30:16.887]  Shentritian is an innovative supplement that stimulates the healing power of the body.
[00:30:16.887 --> 00:30:18.928]  Shentritian is made up of two parts.
[00:30:18.928 --> 00:30:20.349]  The first part is superfoods
[00:30:20.529 --> 00:30:21.149]  We're good to go!
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.642]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:03.246 --> 00:31:09.110]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:15.534]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:15.534 --> 00:31:17.595]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:17.595 --> 00:31:20.057]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:20.057 --> 00:31:30.944]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:33.234 --> 00:31:34.895]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:34.895 --> 00:31:36.757]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:36.757 --> 00:31:43.682]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:51.949]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:51.949 --> 00:31:53.510]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:54.691]  The people strike back.
[00:31:56.576 --> 00:31:57.477]  Attention gardeners!
[00:31:57.477 --> 00:32:00.079]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:04.622]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:12.829]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:32:12.829 --> 00:32:15.631]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:32:15.936 --> 00:32:23.563]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:32:23.563 --> 00:32:29.389]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:34.914]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:32:35.214 --> 00:32:38.755]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:32:38.755 --> 00:32:42.357]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:32:42.357 --> 00:32:47.419]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the ProtoGro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:50.300]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:50.500]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:33:15.104 --> 00:33:22.356]  All right, we are going to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny here in just a moment.
[00:33:22.356 --> 00:33:29.246]  Then we have Dr. Diegel popping in for 30 minutes later with his view, then other folks coming up later in the show.
[00:33:32.702 --> 00:33:38.448]  And we do have callers calling the office from Mexico City saying they can't get through on the Genesis phone lines.
[00:33:38.448 --> 00:33:47.257]  So we're going to be, during this hour and the next hour, calling just individuals in Mexico City via the network so they can get on air and tell us what's going on.
[00:33:47.257 --> 00:33:52.642]  In fact, if you're in Mexico City or have reports about what's happening, email Rob
[00:33:54.181 --> 00:33:57.644]  Do, which is robd at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:57.644 --> 00:34:00.806]  Rob and the initial D at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:03.488]  Specifically, are you seeing more people die?
[00:34:03.488 --> 00:34:06.330]  Are you seeing more people sick than what the media is saying?
[00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:16.758]  Because I have gotten literally hundreds of emails, scores of calls, and then I've seen medical doctors in the BBC from Mexico saying, look, there's a lot more dead and sick than they're saying.
[00:34:16.758 --> 00:34:22.563]  Now, believe me, I live in Texas, where this stuff is popping up in suburbs of Austin, San Antonio.
[00:34:22.563 --> 00:34:23.824]  It's in Dallas, Fort Worth.
[00:34:24.865 --> 00:34:29.708]  It's in Waco, it's in Gonzales, it's all over the place.
[00:34:29.708 --> 00:34:30.969]  I'm hoping it's just a regular flu.
[00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:36.844]  We're going to go to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, who is in, forced out of Mexico yesterday.
[00:34:36.844 --> 00:34:38.485]  She was down there, a medical doctor.
[00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:45.286]  She's now in San Antonio, getting ready to, I guess, take a flight back to her home in the U.S., but she also practices in Mexico.
[00:34:45.286 --> 00:34:47.907]  But I wanted to finish up with the information.
[00:34:47.907 --> 00:34:55.909]  Yes, they've shut down all schools in Mexico, and now they're trying to shut down schools in the U.S., if there's even one potential case of this.
[00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:59.870]  Robert in California, finish up what you were saying about this particular school in California.
[00:35:01.229 --> 00:35:04.050]  Yes sir, they shut it down.
[00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:13.395]  They had nothing on the boy's ethnic origin, nothing on if they had traveled.
[00:35:13.395 --> 00:35:19.218]  The school in New York, the kids had traveled to Cancun, Mexico, so you can trace the source back where those 20 kids in
[00:35:21.582 --> 00:35:25.163]  In New York had, you know, come in contact.
[00:35:25.163 --> 00:35:26.223]  This is very vague.
[00:35:26.223 --> 00:35:29.644]  They don't, you know, all we know is it's a seven-year-old boy.
[00:35:29.644 --> 00:35:32.565]  Six teachers had come in contact with him.
[00:35:32.565 --> 00:35:34.425]  There's another case in Coronado.
[00:35:34.425 --> 00:35:36.326]  I haven't heard anything about that.
[00:35:36.326 --> 00:35:45.308]  And the news had another one up in the capital in Sacramento where a school had one child that came under infection.
[00:35:45.308 --> 00:35:50.689]  And, you know, being so close to the border, I'm like you, you know, here in San Diego, they keep popping up.
[00:35:51.457 --> 00:35:54.218]  But so far this is the only school... Are you kidding?
[00:35:54.218 --> 00:35:57.680]  I mean where I live in Austin, Texas basically is Mexico.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.082]  Austin is kind of the line where Mexico begins.
[00:36:01.082 --> 00:36:02.482]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:36:02.482 --> 00:36:05.604]  We're going to continue with more calls because of all the different angles people bring up.
[00:36:05.604 --> 00:36:14.328]  Like our first caller, Steven Chicago, in case Dr. Tenpenny, Sherry Tenpenny isn't aware of this, swine flu container explodes on train.
[00:36:15.228 --> 00:36:20.572]  This kind of adds credibility to that caller to the power hour saying there were all these trucks driving around with it on ice.
[00:36:20.572 --> 00:36:24.454]  Well, this confirms it was on ice and then exploded a swine flu.
[00:36:24.454 --> 00:36:26.035]  They're saying it was attenuated.
[00:36:26.035 --> 00:36:27.276]  What on earth is going on?
[00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:36.041]  This is out of Dr. Spiegel, major newspaper and magazine, very respected in Germany, very bizarre.
[00:36:36.041 --> 00:36:40.865]  Doctor joining us from San Antonio, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, thank you for coming on.
[00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:41.705]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:36:41.705 --> 00:36:42.746]  Thanks for having me back.
[00:36:43.171 --> 00:36:43.691]  You bet.
[00:36:43.691 --> 00:36:47.952]  Just recapping, briefly tell folks who you are because you can explain your bio better than I can briefly.
[00:36:47.952 --> 00:36:51.533]  And then you were in Mexico and basically forced out.
[00:36:51.533 --> 00:36:52.613]  Recap that.
[00:36:52.613 --> 00:36:58.495]  And then since we talked to you 24 hours ago, your take on this.
[00:36:58.495 --> 00:36:59.315]  Sure.
[00:36:59.315 --> 00:37:01.976]  My office is in practice is in Cleveland, Ohio.
[00:37:01.976 --> 00:37:03.976]  It's called Osteomed 2.
[00:37:03.976 --> 00:37:07.037]  I've done some consulting work over the last seven months in Mexico.
[00:37:07.037 --> 00:37:07.917]  I'm no longer there.
[00:37:08.462 --> 00:37:12.024]  But I was in Mexico, in Monterey, Mexico.
[00:37:12.024 --> 00:37:18.629]  We arrived there on Saturday, this last Saturday, to attend a Medical Tourism Association conference in Monterey.
[00:37:18.629 --> 00:37:22.792]  There were attendees there from literally all over the Western Hemisphere.
[00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:32.038]  We met people from Buenos Aires and Paraguay and Uruguay and Nicaragua and all sorts of places to come to this medical conference, which was to start on Monday morning.
[00:37:32.038 --> 00:37:37.802]  And Monday morning at 9 o'clock, the officials from what is called Monterey Healthcare City,
[00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:59.562]  In correspondence with the people in Mexico City, came in and announced that the tours of the hospital were going to be cancelled and then not only were the tours of the hospitals going to be cancelled, the entire seminar, the entire conference, all day Tuesday and all day Wednesday was to be cancelled and everyone was to immediately find air connections and return home.
[00:37:59.562 --> 00:38:06.646]  So people from South America who had paid thousands and thousands of dollars to attend this conference by airfares had to leave.
[00:38:07.273 --> 00:38:17.002]  My husband and I had decided that we were going to stay in Monterey through Saturday because we had fairly complicated air arrangements to leave the country, but by noon they said no.
[00:38:17.002 --> 00:38:19.144]  The people who had not had air connections
[00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:28.553]  Um, needed to leave the country and they had buses available to take people from Monterey across the border into San Antonio.
[00:38:28.553 --> 00:38:43.202]  So we ended up in a, instead of a bus, there was several different steps that had happened, but long story short, we ended up in a cab, a very nice little cab actually, who drove us seven hours from Monterey to San Antonio to get us out of the country.
[00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:53.273]  We decided not to stay because we thought, well, if they were that serious about paying for a taxi to drive us out of the country, that perhaps the government knew something we didn't know.
[00:38:53.273 --> 00:38:57.895]  We were afraid if we stayed down there that perhaps we wouldn't be able to get across the border.
[00:38:57.895 --> 00:38:59.276]  It was a seven hour cab drive.
[00:38:59.276 --> 00:39:03.678]  There were lots of stops along the way with people, you know, white doctor coats.
[00:39:03.678 --> 00:39:09.340]  They were stopping us along the highway and they were coming and making you roll down the window and seeing if anybody was coughing or sneezing.
[00:39:11.611 --> 00:39:15.354]  All of the immigration people had on masks and they all had on gloves.
[00:39:15.354 --> 00:39:17.615]  That was my next question.
[00:39:17.615 --> 00:39:18.816]  Take your time.
[00:39:18.816 --> 00:39:23.259]  Describe what this was like getting out of Mexico from the time you leave the hotel.
[00:39:23.259 --> 00:39:28.022]  Well, it was really very interesting because while we were in the hotel, and this was a nice hotel.
[00:39:28.022 --> 00:39:31.004]  It's an intercontinental hotel.
[00:39:31.004 --> 00:39:32.385]  Everything was just sort of normal.
[00:39:32.385 --> 00:39:35.427]  By the time everybody had left, they were washing down the floors.
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:45.845]  All of the staff, the front desk people, all started wearing masks and gloves which they hadn't done previously and earlier during the day.
[00:39:45.845 --> 00:39:53.630]  They were handing out masks to everybody in the hotel for leaving the hotel and there's no reported cases in Monterey.
[00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:59.274]  And then as we're driving down the street to get towards the highway we're seeing all these people walking down the street with masks and
[00:39:59.801 --> 00:40:03.084]  And the people that stopped us at the toll booth had on masks and gloves.
[00:40:03.084 --> 00:40:07.067]  I mean, everybody is masked up down there in Mexico.
[00:40:07.067 --> 00:40:09.309]  You said they were stopping you to see if you were sick.
[00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:11.691]  I mean, what were they going to do if you were sick?
[00:40:11.691 --> 00:40:14.613]  You know, that's a really good question because they had a big bus.
[00:40:14.613 --> 00:40:19.857]  I mean, it looked like a big motor vehicle bus.
[00:40:19.857 --> 00:40:29.345]  And that they had over to the side and it said, kind of like the equivalent in Spanish of public health department.
[00:40:29.912 --> 00:40:41.101]  There was a doctor standing there in a very, you know, starched white coat with the gloves and masks on, and they came over and rolled down the windows and were asking if anybody was sick.
[00:40:41.101 --> 00:40:44.023]  So I don't know, maybe they would have taken us off in that bus.
[00:40:44.023 --> 00:40:50.269]  I mean, I don't really know what they were going to do, but they were stopping every single car as we were driving down.
[00:40:50.269 --> 00:40:51.930]  And remember, between Monterey
[00:40:52.443 --> 00:40:55.864]  And Laredo, Texas, the border, there is nothing out there.
[00:40:55.864 --> 00:40:56.925]  I mean, it's just desert.
[00:40:56.925 --> 00:40:58.726]  It's like driving across West Texas.
[00:40:58.726 --> 00:41:02.187]  And they told you get out yesterday on plane, or you have to get out by bus.
[00:41:02.187 --> 00:41:04.788]  So I guess you couldn't get out on planes, you had to do bus.
[00:41:04.788 --> 00:41:12.071]  Yeah, we had to, we couldn't, we just, because of our, the complexity of our air arrangements, we really couldn't get out by plane.
[00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:15.473]  But they were real serious about having everybody leave hotel.
[00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:20.855]  And the last, we were sitting in the hotel waiting for the cab driver to come on, there was a news report
[00:41:21.354 --> 00:41:25.776]  Saying that effectively all of tourism in Mexico has been shut down.
[00:41:25.776 --> 00:41:31.858]  And they were showing hotels that were basically empty and beaches that were basically empty.
[00:41:31.858 --> 00:41:36.380]  So it's one more step... Over 150 something deaths.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.462]  I mean, this really doesn't make sense unless they're covering up what's really happening.
[00:41:41.158 --> 00:41:46.283]  Well, could be, or it's just one more step in effectively destroying the Mexican economy.
[00:41:46.283 --> 00:41:51.268]  That's right, and they're just setting a precedent for martial law, and they're starting to set that here.
[00:41:51.268 --> 00:41:53.650]  Okay, so you're driving across Mexico.
[00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:59.035]  This is obviously not an enjoyable thing to do, but it did get us a lot of key intel.
[00:41:59.035 --> 00:41:59.916]  Tell us what else you saw.
[00:42:00.714 --> 00:42:07.877]  Well, there was, you know, when we even got into some of the smaller towns, I mean, there were people that had, you know, masks and things.
[00:42:07.877 --> 00:42:12.199]  So I don't know how the government had distributed those so quickly.
[00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:19.302]  But it was just the fact that, you know, when we got to the immigration, there were several toll booths along the way that we had to stop and pay a toll.
[00:42:19.758 --> 00:42:20.219]  I don't think so.
[00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:44.983]  Boy, they were all bundled up like trying to make a show that they were either protecting us from them or we were protecting them.
[00:42:44.983 --> 00:42:46.564]  Well, it's all part of the dress-up.
[00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:53.729]  It's all part of the dress-up for the hysteria, you know, that the situational ethics of, oh, we're in different outfits now.
[00:42:53.729 --> 00:42:56.270]  We're in a different role now.
[00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.592]  And, you know, the armies, they're handing them out to you.
[00:42:58.592 --> 00:42:59.212]  They love you.
[00:42:59.212 --> 00:43:00.153]  They're going to take care of you.
[00:43:00.569 --> 00:43:01.570]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:05.272]  And then, of course, there's all the schools that are shut down.
[00:43:05.272 --> 00:43:17.059]  We stopped at a McDonald's to get a cup of coffee, and the newspaper there was saying that all the schools were going to be shut down for the next two weeks just across the border.
[00:43:17.059 --> 00:43:21.442]  And then what really concerns me, Alex, is this morning on the USA Today paper when it
[00:43:22.273 --> 00:43:28.534]  And I'm sure you've already talked about this, that the World Health Organization raises the pandemic alert to Phase 4.
[00:43:28.534 --> 00:43:29.014]  That's right.
[00:43:29.014 --> 00:43:34.775]  Explain to people that's the highest level they've done in a very, very long time.
[00:43:34.775 --> 00:43:36.636]  Explain to people what this means.
[00:43:36.636 --> 00:43:38.036]  Well, I'm really concerned.
[00:43:38.036 --> 00:43:38.776]  I talk about this.
[00:43:38.776 --> 00:43:47.878]  There's a whole section in my book that I wrote in 2005, the Foul Bird Flu It's Not What You Think book, that talks about this pandemic preparedness.
[00:43:48.627 --> 00:44:00.571]  And there's the next level up, which is Phase 5, which is being, all these rules and regulations are being made in Geneva at the World Health Organization for us globally.
[00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:07.913]  And if they go to Phase 5, and I'm going to read to you what Phase 5 is, and it's documented in my book.
[00:44:07.913 --> 00:44:17.636]  It says, assess efficacy and feasibility of prophylaxis for the purpose of attempting to contain outbreaks, which means ring vaccination of family members
[00:44:19.218 --> 00:44:26.600]  Let me stop you.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.320]  I want to go back and start over.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:40.442]  Obviously, you're a medical doctor, but just from the other medical doctors I've talked to, if somebody is already sick in a family, there's a good chance others have already been exposed.
[00:44:40.442 --> 00:44:45.383]  You don't want to vaccinate them, even if the vaccine was safe, which is probably
[00:44:45.643 --> 00:44:47.083]  Questionable at best.
[00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:47.924]  Absolutely.
[00:44:47.924 --> 00:44:53.985]  You don't want to vaccinate somebody while they've already contracted because that can cause all sorts of mutations, can it?
[00:44:53.985 --> 00:44:58.226]  It can make the people sicker or is that incorrect medically?
[00:44:58.226 --> 00:45:04.728]  No, this was the type of procedure that they used with smallpox containment and with the smallpox containment plan.
[00:45:04.728 --> 00:45:13.071]  In fact, it was what the World Health Organization and the CDC says is what eliminated smallpox was ring vaccination and quarantine, which it's my contention.
[00:45:13.071 --> 00:45:14.411]  It was more about the quarantine.
[00:45:14.781 --> 00:45:24.424]  And not the ring vaccination, but this has never been shown to be useful in containing influenza, but it's part of the plan.
[00:45:24.424 --> 00:45:24.944]  Absolutely.
[00:45:24.944 --> 00:45:30.066]  Now, I want you to start over and read all of that, and we're going to go to a quick call in Mexico City and get your take on that.
[00:45:30.066 --> 00:45:31.367]  And we're talking to Dr. Sherry.
[00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:32.127]  Sure, sure.
[00:45:32.127 --> 00:45:34.808]  We're talking to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny for those that just joined us.
[00:45:34.808 --> 00:45:40.810]  I wanted to just add, before we go back to you, because this is key, Kurt Nemo, backing up what you're saying, wrote the story.
[00:45:41.957 --> 00:45:42.377]  I think?
[00:46:00.456 --> 00:46:23.758]  A pandemic outbreak of smallpox or flu to bring in their North American Union, and then we have Ban Ki-moon, the head of the UN, Secretary General, saying that they're going to use this pandemic to test global governance, and so this is being used, and then now what you just said in doctor terms, from level 5, they're already at level 4 and it only goes to level 6, correct?
[00:46:24.418 --> 00:46:32.603]  Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, that we're talking about forced inoculations and now Time Magazine, Newsweek and others are getting the public ready for forced inoculations.
[00:46:32.603 --> 00:46:34.103]  Go ahead now, start over.
[00:46:34.103 --> 00:46:39.346]  Well, for those of you that have my book and you want to check this out for yourself, it's on page 119.
[00:46:39.346 --> 00:46:41.127]  It's Pandemic Alert Period Phase 5.
[00:46:41.127 --> 00:46:48.511]  It says, consider efficacy and feasibility of prophylaxis for the purpose of attempting to contain outbreaks, which implies ring vaccination.
[00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:49.732]  That's number three.
[00:46:49.732 --> 00:46:53.654]  Number four, determine target population for vaccination.
[00:46:54.443 --> 00:46:59.448]  If intervention agreed, implement as an emergency measure and assess impact.
[00:46:59.448 --> 00:47:04.614]  Number five, consider deploying prototype pandemic vaccine if available.
[00:47:04.614 --> 00:47:16.026]  Number six, if agreements are already in place with manufacturers, consider recommending cessation of seasonal vaccine production and initiation of full-scale pandemic vaccine production.
[00:47:16.519 --> 00:47:21.342]  Number seven, adjust priority lists of persons to be vaccinated.
[00:47:21.342 --> 00:47:31.950]  Number eight, plan for vaccine distribution and accelerate preparations for mass vaccination campaigns, education, legal liability issues for when pandemic vaccine is available.
[00:47:32.421 --> 00:47:39.363]  And we know they've been training the police and military to, you know, to bring in the vaccine under guard.
[00:47:39.363 --> 00:47:46.485]  It's kind of like the Cabbage Patch doll thing where they act like they're all sold out, everybody's going to have it, so it creates a riot wanting it.
[00:47:46.485 --> 00:47:55.867]  They do these drills where they practice bringing it in like everybody wants to steal it, and everybody wants it to try to trick the police and military into wanting to take it, though the cops and military are waking up.
[00:47:55.867 --> 00:48:01.049]  So they play all these psychological games, all these drills with FEMA for mass graves that we've confirmed.
[00:48:02.009 --> 00:48:03.990]  The plastic coffins everywhere.
[00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:07.211]  We're at level 4 right now, unprecedented.
[00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:10.532]  Reuters is reporting that that hasn't happened in decades.
[00:48:10.532 --> 00:48:14.553]  And one more level, level 5, goes to forced inoculations?
[00:48:14.553 --> 00:48:16.854]  Is that what you're saying, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny?
[00:48:16.854 --> 00:48:20.355]  I'm saying that that's what the World Health Organization plans is.
[00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:26.757]  And the other thing that really concerns me is that will they implement something called a vaccine ID card?
[00:48:27.168 --> 00:48:27.770]  We're good to go.
[00:48:36.076 --> 00:48:39.277]  And for people that travel, I mean, you know, they've done this before.
[00:48:39.277 --> 00:48:41.979]  They did this back in the 40s with smallpox.
[00:48:41.979 --> 00:48:46.201]  And you just went through checkpoints in Mexico checking to see if you were sick.
[00:48:46.201 --> 00:49:05.189]  That's one step away from the card that you've had the shot and then whatever they're really using to sterilize you or cancer viruses, what they've been caught doing in Africa and Latin America and Asia, they could easily, with the new vaccines they've already produced, or what Baxter's done, tied to shipping out this live bird flu, I mean, this is insane.
[00:49:06.092 --> 00:49:08.235]  Well, we're getting closer every day, aren't we, Alex?
[00:49:08.235 --> 00:49:14.746]  I mean, this is something that I know that I've been tracking since 2000, and you've been doing it at least that long, if not longer.
[00:49:14.746 --> 00:49:19.834]  But it's suddenly like this whole plan, for whatever reason, is coming together as we speak.
[00:49:20.421 --> 00:49:21.882]  You know, it's upsetting me, doctor.
[00:49:21.882 --> 00:49:26.123]  You're a highly respected medical doctor, you know, you're on mainstream radio and TV.
[00:49:26.123 --> 00:49:31.946]  You were kind of calling for calm yesterday and saying, you know, this is probably just a bunch of hype, but boy, they're acting strange.
[00:49:31.946 --> 00:49:40.289]  Twenty-four hours later, or twenty-three hours to be technical, you are totally, and it's the same thing, I have this bad feeling.
[00:49:40.289 --> 00:49:45.211]  I've been saying there's no way they can get their New World Order agenda through without some crisis
[00:49:45.751 --> 00:49:50.295]  To make everybody stand down to the New Bank of the World, the police state, the troops on the streets.
[00:49:50.295 --> 00:49:53.137]  You've had all this feverish preparation last year.
[00:49:53.137 --> 00:49:56.981]  Four mass flu pandemics everywhere confirmed.
[00:49:56.981 --> 00:50:00.844]  And then, so you see all this preparation right before it happens.
[00:50:00.844 --> 00:50:05.027]  I hope this is just a beta test by these people, but this could be the balloon going up.
[00:50:05.027 --> 00:50:05.608]  Well, it could.
[00:50:05.608 --> 00:50:11.353]  And if you remember, right soon after, I believe it was right after the inauguration, when the Vice President said,
[00:50:11.704 --> 00:50:16.687]  You know, in the first hundred days, they'll be, you know, that maybe the president will really be challenged with something.
[00:50:16.687 --> 00:50:21.830]  And he sort of said that, sort of let it slip when Biden said, you know... That was at a private donor meeting.
[00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.051]  Yeah, he didn't know it was being recorded.
[00:50:23.051 --> 00:50:24.051]  Well, maybe this is it.
[00:50:24.051 --> 00:50:28.674]  You know, this is an international, going to be an international crisis.
[00:50:28.674 --> 00:50:30.855]  It's going to be across our borders.
[00:50:30.855 --> 00:50:34.557]  And it's, you know, all of these things popping up everywhere, Alex.
[00:50:34.557 --> 00:50:35.418]  I mean, I kept saying,
[00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:40.414]  How can this possibly be unless it's been in the water, in the air, in somewhere?
[00:50:40.414 --> 00:50:44.476]  There's not enough people to have done, you know, face-to-face contact with this.
[00:50:44.476 --> 00:50:46.977]  Alright, Dr. Sherry Tinpinny, we're going to give your website out.
[00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:48.098]  People can learn more when we come back.
[00:50:48.098 --> 00:50:49.539]  You're going to stay with us another 30 minutes.
[00:50:49.539 --> 00:50:50.580]  We appreciate that.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.302]  We're going to go to Mexico City and Justin with a report as well.
[00:50:54.302 --> 00:50:56.963]  Stay with me.
[00:50:56.963 --> 00:50:58.264]  Ah, springtime.
[00:50:58.264 --> 00:51:03.447]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how do we keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:08.404]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[00:51:08.404 --> 00:51:14.369]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[00:51:14.369 --> 00:51:22.656]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[00:51:22.996 --> 00:51:25.960]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:36.834]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[00:51:36.834 --> 00:51:40.238]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas,
[00:51:40.578 --> 00:51:46.660]  Roaches, crickets, and more, and safe enough to use on your pets, ridding them of fleas and other pests.

[00:51:49.381 --> 00:51:51.222]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:03.291]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:03.291 --> 00:52:10.343]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:10.862 --> 00:52:17.406]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:17.406 --> 00:52:19.427]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:19.427 --> 00:52:21.928]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:21.928 --> 00:52:32.894]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:35.172]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:35.172 --> 00:52:37.033]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:37.033 --> 00:52:43.940]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:52.207]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:52.207 --> 00:52:53.789]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:54.990]  The people strike back.
[00:52:58.337 --> 00:52:59.458]  Spring is here.
[00:52:59.458 --> 00:53:00.418]  Growing season.
[00:53:00.418 --> 00:53:02.619]  The economy is not getting any better.
[00:53:02.619 --> 00:53:04.340]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.300]  Think about it.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:09.402]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[00:53:09.402 --> 00:53:13.084]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[00:53:13.084 --> 00:53:15.925]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[00:53:15.925 --> 00:53:27.790]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.470]  I think so.
[00:54:02.556 --> 00:54:08.301]  This is huge breaking news.
[00:54:08.301 --> 00:54:17.068]  North Carolina involuntarily isolating suspected swine flu patients.
[00:54:17.068 --> 00:54:21.731]  States refuse to divulge details of cases.
[00:54:21.731 --> 00:54:24.514]  See, they've had their whole police state grid set up, geared up.
[00:54:25.838 --> 00:54:28.459]  This is being reported by WRAL News.
[00:54:28.459 --> 00:54:32.361]  A detailed report is at Infowars.net by Steve Watson.
[00:54:32.361 --> 00:54:33.382]  Infowars.net.
[00:54:33.382 --> 00:54:36.743]  And whenever they declare they're at a level 3, they're really at a level 4.
[00:54:36.743 --> 00:54:39.725]  When they declare they're at a level 4, they're really at a level 5.
[00:54:39.725 --> 00:54:41.085]  That's how governments operate.
[00:54:41.085 --> 00:54:46.748]  So, the governments are operating as if this is the 1918 flu.
[00:54:46.748 --> 00:54:47.708]  The killer flu.
[00:54:47.708 --> 00:54:53.351]  They're acting like this is hell on earth, while meanwhile telling us everything's fine, so we stand down and there's not panic.
[00:54:54.153 --> 00:55:06.901]  And notice, I kept saying week after week, the last few months, I said they're gonna launch a major stage terror attack, a nuke attack, a new war, or a bird flu of some type, because I could see the hype.
[00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:10.943]  And I said over and over again last month, I believe they're gonna play the bird flu.
[00:55:10.943 --> 00:55:18.247]  And I never make a prediction, except maybe once a year or so, and unfortunately they almost always come true.
[00:55:18.247 --> 00:55:22.130]  And now, just like with the false flag attack though,
[00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.349]  of course.
[00:55:40.794 --> 00:55:42.135]  And then they hype it up.
[00:55:42.135 --> 00:55:48.198]  So let's just hope they're using this as a pretext to grab power and pose as saviors and using this as a smokescreen.
[00:55:48.198 --> 00:55:51.659]  Let's hope it isn't really some weaponized flu they've released.
[00:55:51.659 --> 00:55:53.700]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny is with us.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.901]  She just left Mexico.
[00:55:54.901 --> 00:55:56.561]  She was down there witnessing a lot of this.
[00:55:56.561 --> 00:56:01.744]  We go to Justin in Mexico City joining us.
[00:56:01.744 --> 00:56:04.005]  Justin, tell us a little bit about yourself.
[00:56:04.005 --> 00:56:05.125]  You called in on the show Saturday.
[00:56:05.125 --> 00:56:08.207]  I guess you're an American living in Mexico or are you a Mexican?
[00:56:09.046 --> 00:56:12.007]  I'm Canadian, but I'm going to let them in America.
[00:56:12.007 --> 00:56:14.108]  Okay, great, but it's all America, period.
[00:56:14.108 --> 00:56:16.549]  Tell us what you're witnessing right now, sir.
[00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:19.830]  Well, today, Mexico City seems like a ghost town.
[00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:26.632]  There's hardly any pollution, hardly any movement, and it does seem like they're just shutting everything down.
[00:56:26.632 --> 00:56:31.914]  They're even talking about shutting down the subway and all public transportation.
[00:56:31.914 --> 00:56:38.076]  And there's soldiers at all the toll roads going out, checking people and handing out masks.
[00:56:38.692 --> 00:56:43.237]  And there's also a lot of people fleeing the city because they've cancelled school.
[00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:48.281]  A lot of people see no reason to stay here and they're leaving.
[00:56:48.281 --> 00:56:55.949]  I spent about three days at the hospital when my wife was giving birth and I observed a lot of things.
[00:56:55.949 --> 00:57:01.074]  The doctor told me that they had one confirmed death from the flu there and five confirmed cases.
[00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:08.313]  But he also said that there are 20 deaths due to respiratory illness there, which they don't know, because they don't have the facility to test for it.
[00:57:08.313 --> 00:57:09.634]  Alright, what's the name of the hospital?
[00:57:09.634 --> 00:57:10.575]  What's the name of the hospital?
[00:57:10.575 --> 00:57:12.997]  This is big news.
[00:57:12.997 --> 00:57:13.998]  Is it a big hospital?
[00:57:13.998 --> 00:57:14.618]  What's the name?
[00:57:14.618 --> 00:57:16.860]  San Bartolo Hospital.
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:21.044]  It's a public hospital in El Copa and Juarez.
[00:57:21.044 --> 00:57:22.685]  So it's in Juarez?
[00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:24.707]  El Copa.
[00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:25.407]  How do you spell that?
[00:57:25.407 --> 00:57:28.290]  N-A-U-C-A-U-L-P-A-N.
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:37.302]  Okay, well we know you're in Mexico City, we can hear those roosters.
[00:57:37.302 --> 00:57:39.943]  I like that sound, kind of like a train in the night.
[00:57:39.943 --> 00:57:43.525]  I'm going to hold you over, sir, I appreciate you getting in contact with the office.
[00:57:43.525 --> 00:57:46.746]  And by the way, he did call us, we have a caller ID, he is in Mexico City.
[00:57:46.746 --> 00:57:49.907]  And we've called him back in Mexico City, so we've confirmed that.
[00:57:49.907 --> 00:57:51.608]  Dr. Tenpenny.
[00:57:52.428 --> 00:57:58.130]  Can you specifically, since you're a medical doctor, ask him key questions about what he saw in this hospital?
[00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:04.952]  20 deaths from respiratory, they haven't tested him for flu, and one death in that hospital alone from flu confirmed.
[00:58:04.952 --> 00:58:08.953]  I mean, that's what we keep getting from everybody in Mexico, is it's much worse than we're being told.
[00:58:08.953 --> 00:58:14.995]  Did you actually ask the physicians what they thought the cause of deaths were?
[00:58:14.995 --> 00:58:18.776]  I mean, if they only have one confirmed death, but they're calling it other respiratory things,
[00:58:19.164 --> 00:58:23.145]  There could be a whole lot of other things in Mexico that people are dying from, respiratory-wise.
[00:58:23.145 --> 00:58:27.886]  That's true, but I did notice that the doctors were very panicked.
[00:58:27.886 --> 00:58:30.587]  They're really, uh, stressed out, working overtime.
[00:58:30.587 --> 00:58:32.467]  Yeah, there's an increase of death and sickness.
[00:58:32.467 --> 00:58:33.147]  Stay there.
[00:58:33.147 --> 00:58:37.788]  Back in 70 seconds, with a second hour.

[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.501]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:48.501 --> 00:58:53.222]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:53.222 --> 00:58:56.184]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:58:56.184 --> 00:58:59.225]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:58:59.225 --> 00:59:05.087]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:05.307 --> 00:59:08.550]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:15.555]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:15.555 --> 00:59:18.818]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:35.971 --> 00:59:37.773]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:49.494 --> 00:59:51.896]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:51.896 --> 01:00:01.342]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:01.342 --> 01:00:02.642]  Big Brother.
[01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:04.423]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:04.423 --> 01:00:06.185]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:07.746]  You want answers?
[01:00:07.746 --> 01:00:09.307]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:09.307 --> 01:00:13.069]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:17.552]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.762]  There's no other way to put it.
[01:00:21.762 --> 01:00:26.105]  I foresaw weaponized flu in the last two months.
[01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:31.991]  On air, scores of times saying I believe that's the card they would play.
[01:00:31.991 --> 01:00:35.314]  Our limited staff's working so hard just covering the news, bringing the latest info.
[01:00:35.314 --> 01:00:40.198]  We don't have time to go back through all the shows and pull those clips out, but somebody should and post it up on YouTube.
[01:00:40.198 --> 01:00:44.282]  We'll play it here because people need to hear that.
[01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:59.361]  You know, I'm very careful about what I say, but we had just hundreds and hundreds of indicators of pre-hype movements, covert documents, secret documents we got about governments all over the world preparing for a impending pandemic.
[01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:02.223]  FEMA drills that were used as covers to get ready.
[01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:07.028]  FEMA people I talked to off the record saying they see something's coming.
[01:01:07.028 --> 01:01:09.570]  Quail saying last week it was going to happen in the next two weeks.
[01:01:12.642 --> 01:01:13.643]  This is just amazing.
[01:01:13.643 --> 01:01:20.347]  Going back to medical doctor Sherry Penny and we're also talking to Justin from Mexico City.
[01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:21.268]  We've called him there.
[01:01:21.268 --> 01:01:22.589]  He is there.
[01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:30.354]  And he was at a hospital there in Mexico City where they're saying they had 20 deaths from respiratory illness.
[01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:33.416]  I mean, did you ask the doctors why you know they have one flu death?
[01:01:33.936 --> 01:01:34.356]  I thought that um...
[01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:04.117]  Supposedly they have a quarantine, but they have the healthy pregnant women mixed in with all the other sick people.
[01:02:04.117 --> 01:02:06.418]  That's what they consider the quarantine.
[01:02:06.418 --> 01:02:08.320]  But just that visitors can't go in.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.182]  But all the patients are mixed in together.
[01:02:11.182 --> 01:02:14.725]  And, uh, I even saw a guy vomiting blood.
[01:02:14.725 --> 01:02:23.593]  And, uh, that they're selling, uh, the masks, the, the, uh, respiratory masks for up to 50 pesos.
[01:02:23.593 --> 01:02:24.734]  And they're only worth one peso.
[01:02:25.925 --> 01:02:27.367]  People are really panicking.
[01:02:27.367 --> 01:02:29.831]  Even to the point where now people are stockpiling food.
[01:02:32.389 --> 01:02:36.370]  Yeah, we've been telling folks to do that, just as an insurance policy, but they don't listen.
[01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:43.631]  Because, you know, we told people a couple of years ago GM was going to go out of business because we saw their internal documents coming out and they laughed at us.
[01:02:43.631 --> 01:02:54.653]  I want to hold you over, sir, I want to keep picking your brain, but the best person to be able to brief you or debrief you is Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, medical doctor who was just in Mexico yesterday.
[01:02:54.653 --> 01:02:58.293]  Doctor, questions for the caller from Mexico City?
[01:02:58.293 --> 01:03:00.754]  Well, I have more of a comment than a question, Alex.
[01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:02.087]  Flu.
[01:03:02.087 --> 01:03:05.530]  Influenza by definition is a respiratory illness.
[01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:16.718]  So people that were vomiting and passing out, throwing up blood, if they're saying that this has something to do with this flu virus, then that means there's something drastically different about this virus.
[01:03:16.718 --> 01:03:20.181]  It's not a respiratory virus or it was something else.
[01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:24.024]  And for the sake of hysteria, they're blaming it on the flu virus.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.164]  So it could just be some horrible cold bug?
[01:03:28.164 --> 01:03:33.551]  Well it could be a completely different type of virus other than this H1N1 that they keep talking about.
[01:03:33.551 --> 01:03:34.973]  I mean it was H1N5 or H5N1.
[01:03:38.365 --> 01:03:49.077]  With the bird flu, and now this is H1N1, they're all influenza A viruses, and by definition, what those viruses do is cause a respiratory illness.
[01:03:49.077 --> 01:03:56.705]  Fever, chills, cough, pneumonia, it's a respiratory... So you've got 20 deaths, why are they calling it respiratory versus flu?
[01:03:58.021 --> 01:03:59.001]  I'm sorry?
[01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:04.683]  I mean, if flu is respiratory generally, then why are they saying, oh, this is a flu death, but these are respiratory?
[01:04:04.683 --> 01:04:06.764]  I mean, did you ask the doctors?
[01:04:06.764 --> 01:04:07.544]  That's my point.
[01:04:07.544 --> 01:04:09.284]  Yeah, I know.
[01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:10.365]  No, I didn't ask the doctors.
[01:04:10.365 --> 01:04:12.425]  I talked to them quickly.
[01:04:12.425 --> 01:04:14.486]  My wife is giving birth.
[01:04:14.486 --> 01:04:16.767]  But they definitely seem nervous.
[01:04:16.767 --> 01:04:20.648]  They're all begging the administration to give them the vaccines.
[01:04:21.673 --> 01:04:24.137]  They supposedly have some sort of vaccine that they can give them now.
[01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:36.154]  Justin, I want to come back to Dr. Tinpenny on the other side.
[01:04:36.154 --> 01:04:41.879]  We got a call Saturday that the Mexican President was on TV saying, we've got a vaccine, don't worry.
[01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:43.120]  I confirmed that.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.205]  How would they have a vaccine for something that just became a big crisis Friday, Saturday?
[01:04:48.205 --> 01:04:54.251]  And we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Dr. Sherry Tinpenny and our listener there in Mexico City.
[01:04:57.079 --> 01:05:04.201]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:19.806]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the
[01:05:20.426 --> 01:05:25.789]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:32.313]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:05:32.313 --> 01:05:36.195]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:38.897]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:05:38.897 --> 01:05:44.260]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.242]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:47.242 --> 01:05:49.463]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:05:49.463 --> 01:05:51.965]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:05:51.965 --> 01:05:57.409]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:05:57.409 --> 01:06:03.233]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:03.233 --> 01:06:10.198]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:17.378]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:17.378 --> 01:06:19.360]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.863]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:21.863 --> 01:06:32.835]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:33.442 --> 01:06:35.102]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:35.102 --> 01:06:36.963]  It's about a one world government.
[01:06:36.963 --> 01:06:43.864]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:06:52.126 --> 01:06:53.707]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:53.707 --> 01:06:54.887]  The people strike back.
[01:06:56.707 --> 01:06:57.408]  You worry.
[01:06:57.408 --> 01:06:59.749]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:00.310]  Hi.
[01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:03.072]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[01:07:03.072 --> 01:07:07.635]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[01:07:07.635 --> 01:07:10.097]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[01:07:10.097 --> 01:07:13.460]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.381]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:18.183]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[01:07:18.183 --> 01:07:21.906]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[01:07:21.906 --> 01:07:25.949]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[01:07:26.289 --> 01:07:30.391]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[01:07:30.391 --> 01:07:36.713]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[01:07:36.713 --> 01:07:39.074]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[01:07:39.074 --> 01:07:41.195]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[01:07:41.195 --> 01:07:45.836]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:07:45.836 --> 01:07:46.757]  Start now.
[01:07:46.757 --> 01:07:48.477]  Knowledge is power.
[01:07:48.477 --> 01:07:49.478]  Better take action.
[01:07:49.478 --> 01:07:50.438]  I think a storm's coming.
[01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:06.521]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:08.102]  You want answers?
[01:08:08.102 --> 01:08:09.642]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:09.642 --> 01:08:13.845]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.845 --> 01:08:17.907]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:28.951 --> 01:08:33.474]  I just got a call from an American expatriate living in Mexico saying, Alex, you got it wrong.
[01:08:33.474 --> 01:08:36.596]  Mexico City is a stretch for hundreds of miles.
[01:08:36.596 --> 01:08:44.120]  What I said was, the suburbs are made up of hundreds of square miles.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.503]  Austin, Texas is, I think, over a hundred square miles.
[01:08:47.503 --> 01:08:49.344]  I mean, learn what I'm saying here, okay?
[01:08:49.344 --> 01:08:51.245]  The point is, it's big.
[01:08:51.245 --> 01:08:53.366]  Some years it's rated as the biggest city in the world.
[01:08:53.366 --> 01:08:54.467]  It's always in the top three.
[01:08:54.467 --> 01:08:55.588]  That's my point.
[01:08:55.588 --> 01:08:55.988]  It's big.
[01:08:57.609 --> 01:09:01.451]  28 million they say in the city and the suburbs is 35 million total.
[01:09:01.451 --> 01:09:12.677]  So, the big news here is North Carolina involuntarily isolating, that's forcibly, North Carolina forcibly isolating suspected swine flu patients.
[01:09:12.677 --> 01:09:16.159]  That is the headline on InfoWars.net.
[01:09:16.159 --> 01:09:18.801]  InfoWars.net, Steve Watson reporting.
[01:09:19.775 --> 01:09:23.778]  And he has links to multiple mainstream sources where they calmly announce it.
[01:09:23.778 --> 01:09:34.725]  Going back to Dr. Sherry Tinpetty, who was just in Mexico at a major conference and kicked out of the country, along with other Americans and other foreigners, and then who drove by bus several hundred miles out of the country.
[01:09:34.725 --> 01:09:41.209]  They're out of Monterey, now in San Antonio, Texas, just south of where I come to you from, in Austin, Texas, with this outbreak all around me.
[01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:42.810]  Will it turn into a pandemic is the question.
[01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:46.672]  Doctor, you were just talking about the U.N.
[01:09:46.672 --> 01:09:49.735]  saying they're in control of the United States and Mexico.
[01:09:49.735 --> 01:09:52.657]  Basically, those governments are following their orders.
[01:09:52.657 --> 01:09:55.158]  That's in all the major publications.
[01:09:55.158 --> 01:10:03.504]  The White House announced Sunday that we're under a civil emergency and has implemented the executive orders which are categorized as martial law.
[01:10:03.504 --> 01:10:11.810]  This looks like, because they're shutting down schools all over the country and they're involuntarily quarantining people, that they are beginning to implement Level 5.
[01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:23.353]  Level 5, Alex, and I actually am going to post this document from the World Health Organization that was published in November 2005.
[01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.533]  So this has been in the works for a long time.
[01:10:25.533 --> 01:10:29.494]  This entire plan, when you read it, I want people to be able to read it.
[01:10:29.494 --> 01:10:30.994]  Well, Sarah, you were cut off at first.
[01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:32.235]  You were saying, what about Level 5?
[01:10:32.235 --> 01:10:33.575]  This is Level 5?
[01:10:33.575 --> 01:10:38.236]  No, that when we go to Level 5, that's when they will start instituting ring vaccination
[01:10:38.703 --> 01:10:41.585]  Consider making lists of people to vaccinate.
[01:10:41.585 --> 01:10:45.728]  They will start to talk about mandatory vaccination at that point.
[01:10:45.728 --> 01:10:46.749]  That's level 5.
[01:10:46.749 --> 01:10:50.671]  Today in the newspaper it talks about that we're currently at level 4.
[01:10:50.671 --> 01:10:55.735]  So level 6 actually says consider applying emergency powers.
[01:10:55.735 --> 01:11:00.859]  And that's right off of the World Health Organization document that I'll post later today on DrTenPenny.com
[01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:05.754]  So that everybody can find it easily and read it for themselves.
[01:11:05.754 --> 01:11:22.048]  Okay, 24 hours later, what is your professional opinion as a medical doctor who has been studying bird flu and other forms of flu and pandemics for years, who's been in Mexico from reading what the other scientists and doctors and virologists are saying, what is your prognosis here?
[01:11:22.048 --> 01:11:24.891]  It seems that from yesterday, you're saying things are darkening?
[01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:28.475]  Yes, I believe that they are.
[01:11:28.475 --> 01:11:36.602]  I believe this is a plan that's coming together that's been in place since at least the publications in 2005 and it probably took them a year or two to put this together.
[01:11:36.602 --> 01:11:43.849]  It's ironic to me that all of these things are popping up all over.
[01:11:43.849 --> 01:11:44.629]  How can that be?
[01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:47.792]  There can't be enough people who have been in Mexico that have spread this.
[01:11:48.294 --> 01:11:56.202]  To have people in British Columbia and Nova Scotia and Atlanta and Miami and Texas all over the place having been in contact with each other.
[01:11:56.202 --> 01:11:57.663]  And it's happening in schools.
[01:11:57.663 --> 01:11:59.625]  I wonder if these kids were just vaccinated.
[01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:05.431]  This has been the forced inoculation in the last few weeks where they threaten the kids and say you gotta take shots to be in schools.
[01:12:05.431 --> 01:12:06.011]  Could be.
[01:12:06.011 --> 01:12:07.313]  It could very well be that.
[01:12:07.313 --> 01:12:11.657]  We just want to put a brief plug in here for the movie V for Vendetta.
[01:12:12.358 --> 01:12:17.461]  If people haven't watched that, go rent it and watch it, because they actually talk about this whole plan in this movie.
[01:12:17.461 --> 01:12:22.064]  It's fiction, obviously, but they talk about starting with things in schools.
[01:12:22.064 --> 01:12:26.126]  Yeah, the government releases a bioweapon to bring in martial law.
[01:12:26.126 --> 01:12:27.687]  Yep, exactly.
[01:12:27.687 --> 01:12:29.708]  And I'm really concerned about this, Alex.
[01:12:29.708 --> 01:12:33.210]  I mean, I've always thought that that was kind of like, yeah, sure, that couldn't really happen.
[01:12:33.755 --> 01:12:47.864]  But even from my rather conservative post that I want to always just put out documented information that I can find from conventional medical literature, that it just seems as though there is a bigger plan that's absolutely being put in motion here.
[01:12:47.864 --> 01:13:01.393]  Well, either way, they're hyping something that isn't that big of a deal and using it for power and control, or it is naturally occurring and they're covering up just how deadly it is, or they've released it and are covering up just how deadly it is.
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:03.161]  All of the above, I agree.
[01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:07.662]  It could be any one or maybe even a combination of the three.
[01:13:07.662 --> 01:13:13.544]  So, there's a lot to be said for this and I think that there's a lot to be said for how people can keep healthy.
[01:13:13.544 --> 01:13:17.446]  You know, I'm a big proponent of health is from the inside out.
[01:13:17.446 --> 01:13:22.568]  And, you know, if it's a weaponized virus, you know, maybe our normal armamentarium isn't going to work.
[01:13:22.938 --> 01:13:41.288]  If it's a regular, just stronger strain of flu virus than things like vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin C, drinking plenty of water, getting to bed on time, eating organic food, all of those things are the normal things that we can do and the most important thing you can do is not to live in the fear because the fear brings your cortisol levels up.
[01:13:41.288 --> 01:13:47.752]  When the cortisol levels go up, that makes your immune system go down and the fear itself makes you more susceptible to be infected.
[01:13:48.593 --> 01:13:49.393]  Absolutely.
[01:13:49.393 --> 01:13:52.735]  So, what would you recommend?
[01:13:52.735 --> 01:13:54.715]  How do people find nano masks?
[01:13:54.715 --> 01:14:06.620]  I know they have masks that are much thicker that actually do really cut down on, normally the virus is suspended in mucus from a sneeze or saliva or touching the eyes.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:09.061]  I guess wash your hands a lot.
[01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:15.123]  If you were in South or Central Texas where this stuff is breaking out or Southern California, I mean, would you take your children out of school, doctor?
[01:14:16.024 --> 01:14:21.888]  I probably would, just from the sake of, you know, the hysteria of everything that's going on around there.
[01:14:21.888 --> 01:14:24.629]  I mean, I just keep my kids home and keep them healthy.
[01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:31.634]  You know, even in the pandemic, the 1918 pandemic, I mean, yes, a lot of people died, but most people didn't.
[01:14:32.354 --> 01:14:36.915]  So, I mean, I tend to would focus on, I'm not going to be one of those people that are going to get sick.
[01:14:36.915 --> 01:14:41.376]  I'm going to continually do the things that I need to do to keep myself and my family healthy.
[01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:50.198]  And instead of focusing on the bad side, how many people have died and how many people are going to get, you know, laid off and all these other things, I mean, what if we focused on, it's not going to hurt me.
[01:14:50.198 --> 01:14:55.139]  I'm going to be just fine and be one of those on the survival side of the equation.
[01:14:55.139 --> 01:15:00.340]  I think that that is an upbeat message that we can give while we're reporting in real time what's going on.
[01:15:00.765 --> 01:15:08.328]  That if we stay out of the fear and do the things that we know we need to do to stay healthy, that we'll be a survivor no matter what kind of pandemic might happen.
[01:15:08.328 --> 01:15:14.750]  But the bigger issue here is North Carolina involuntary isolating suspected swine flu patients.
[01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.951]  InfoWars.net.
[01:15:16.951 --> 01:15:24.574]  I'm hoping that they're isolating them in their own homes and they're not throwing a whole bunch of people in one place who might be sick, contaminating the people who weren't sick.
[01:15:25.459 --> 01:15:26.099]  Absolutely.
[01:15:26.099 --> 01:15:35.204]  Well, I mean, speak to that, but also, then we'll go back to Mexico City and then more calls with Dr. Tim Penney, our guest today.
[01:15:35.204 --> 01:15:37.725]  Looking at this, what about the vaccine?
[01:15:37.725 --> 01:15:45.969]  How can Calderon, and I've confirmed this and you just heard the listener that we've confirmed in Mexico City, we called him back in Mexico City to confirm it.
[01:15:48.154 --> 01:15:57.600]  To have him saying, don't worry, we've got a vaccine already ready, and then the caller said that when he was in the hospital, the doctors were saying they wanted the vaccine for themselves.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.063]  I mean, how could they, if they just figured out in the last week this thing is deadly, claim they've already got a vaccine for it?
[01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:05.285]  You know, that's sort of an interesting comment.
[01:16:05.285 --> 01:16:08.287]  I'm glad you recycled that back around and came up to that.
[01:16:08.287 --> 01:16:13.330]  Because according to the CDC, in order for a vaccine to be effective, it has to be an exact match.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:18.841]  If they've just found out what this is in the last three or four days, that means one of two things.
[01:16:18.841 --> 01:16:20.081]  One of several things.
[01:16:20.081 --> 01:16:34.544]  Either it's not going to be an exact match and they just want to vaccinate people, or it's going to be what they call close enough and they think it'll give some protection, or it's a type of virus that they've known for a long time and a lot of the biotech companies have been experimenting with this.
[01:16:34.544 --> 01:16:41.686]  I mean, remember back in 2005, they were given $7.2 billion through BioShield to start developing pandemic viruses and drugs.
[01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:45.510]  So, you know, who knows what has been going on around there.
[01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:46.910]  Yeah, let's stop right there.
[01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:50.812]  36 level 4 bioweapons labs moving Plum Island to San Antonio.
[01:16:50.812 --> 01:16:51.473]  Oh, San Antonio.
[01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:53.353]  You know, things like that.
[01:16:53.353 --> 01:16:59.576]  Moving them from the middle of Montana to the middle of Dallas, from the middle of, you know, South Dakota to New York City.
[01:16:59.576 --> 01:17:01.137]  Yes, to Manhattan.
[01:17:01.137 --> 01:17:02.098]  All of this craziness.
[01:17:03.138 --> 01:17:13.256]  In the words of the Baltimore Sun, headline, create thousands of gallons of liquid death, bioweapons, to create bioweapons and then their cures, absolutely, key point.
[01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:23.710]  Yes, and they've also, you know, been doing things like posting up viral sequences on the internet, you know, under the auspices of sharing these sequences with other researchers around the world.
[01:17:23.710 --> 01:17:35.339]  Just like they put out the mouse pox, which with a full ingredients list, how to easily make a 90 plus percent kill rate animal pox for humans.
[01:17:35.339 --> 01:17:36.560]  Yeah, why do they do that?
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.322]  And why are all these microbiologists being brutally murdered?
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:53.370]  Well, I can't really speak to that because it isn't anything that I've followed, but I'll tell you, when I first heard about some of the things about posting up these viral sequences, it was like, that made absolutely no sense to me.
[01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:58.074]  It's like giving somebody the recipe to disaster and saying, oops, now we've created a disaster.
[01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:07.221]  So, there's a lot of amazing things that are going on, and then that may lend itself to be why this is supposed to be.
[01:18:07.668 --> 01:18:16.654]  A piece of pig virus from several different parts of the world and bird virus and human viruses because somebody has sequenced it from just taking information off the internet.
[01:18:16.654 --> 01:18:24.759]  Well, every doctor we talk to, every virologist we talk to or so we see on the news says, this is probably engineered, but that's kind of just a back story.
[01:18:24.759 --> 01:18:26.040]  We need to talk more about that.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.783]  Going back to Justin in Mexico City, what are you seeing?
[01:18:29.783 --> 01:18:31.644]  You're saying it's a ghost town.
[01:18:31.644 --> 01:18:33.846]  People are starting to hoard food.
[01:18:33.846 --> 01:18:34.946]  There's checkpoints.
[01:18:34.946 --> 01:18:37.308]  Any other key intel points for us?
[01:18:38.688 --> 01:18:40.949]  Just that a lot of people are starting to really panic.
[01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:46.752]  This on top of the economic crisis is just bringing this place to a standstill.
[01:18:46.752 --> 01:18:52.574]  I want to ask him, since he's down there first hand, how much damage did you see from the earthquake that happened yesterday?
[01:18:52.574 --> 01:18:54.975]  And is that compounding the problem of people leaving?
[01:18:54.975 --> 01:18:55.455]  Yeah, the 6.0.
[01:18:55.455 --> 01:19:01.677]  To be honest with you, I was in the hospital and someone said there was just an earthquake and I didn't even feel it.
[01:19:04.036 --> 01:19:06.680]  As far as I know, it didn't really damage Mexico City.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.843]  They said it shook major buildings.
[01:19:08.843 --> 01:19:10.685]  Go ahead.
[01:19:10.685 --> 01:19:12.969]  In Guerrero, it did more damage, I think.
[01:19:12.969 --> 01:19:16.033]  But it doesn't seem to have affected here very much.
[01:19:16.033 --> 01:19:18.817]  But I'm sure it's made people panic a lot.
[01:19:18.817 --> 01:19:21.100]  You know, that on top of everything else that's happening.
[01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:27.391]  It's just speechless.
[01:19:27.391 --> 01:19:29.092]  You know, I have three children.
[01:19:29.092 --> 01:19:30.873]  I'm not too worried about dying myself.
[01:19:30.873 --> 01:19:32.434]  I've faced death and I'm ready for it.
[01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.795]  I don't want it to happen.
[01:19:33.795 --> 01:19:36.276]  I really enjoy a life of a lot of gusto.
[01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:39.398]  And, you know, I don't want my wife or parents or people to die.
[01:19:39.398 --> 01:19:40.619]  But they've had lives.
[01:19:40.619 --> 01:19:42.700]  My children, I can't handle it.
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.101]  And let me tell you something, folks.
[01:19:44.101 --> 01:19:48.444]  Anything happens to my children, and then it comes out the government did it, that's it.
[01:19:48.444 --> 01:19:52.207]  I'm not putting up with any more eugenicist crap anymore.
[01:19:53.147 --> 01:19:57.149]  All of you professors and the rest of you, I'm coming for you.
[01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:59.591]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:01.532]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[01:20:01.532 --> 01:20:05.994]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[01:20:05.994 --> 01:20:14.999]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years and carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.
[01:20:14.999 --> 01:20:18.821]  Go to www.rareseeds.com for more information.
[01:20:18.821 --> 01:20:20.062]  That's rareseeds.com.
[01:20:20.902 --> 01:20:25.946]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:29.569]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[01:20:29.569 --> 01:20:36.355]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds strived every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[01:20:36.355 --> 01:20:40.519]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[01:20:40.519 --> 01:20:44.322]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:48.711]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long-term storage.
[01:20:48.711 --> 01:20:54.134]  Go to www.rareseeds.com and get your seeds from America's pure seed source.
[01:20:54.134 --> 01:20:57.236]  That's rareseeds.com.
[01:20:57.236 --> 01:21:02.499]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:21:03.255 --> 01:21:09.138]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:21:09.138 --> 01:21:15.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.621]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:21:17.621 --> 01:21:20.082]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:21:20.082 --> 01:21:30.967]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:21:33.254 --> 01:21:34.916]  It's not about left or right.
[01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:36.777]  It's about a one world government.
[01:21:36.777 --> 01:21:43.704]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:21:51.971 --> 01:21:53.533]  The Obama Deception.
[01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:54.734]  The people strike back.
[01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:58.968]  Today, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, April 28, 2009.
[01:21:58.968 --> 01:21:59.969]  Gold open this morning at $8.9170.
[01:21:59.969 --> 01:22:02.930]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.1769, $4.5885 for the half-ounce, and $2.2942 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:03.391]  That's $9.1769, $4.5885, and $2.2942.
[01:22:15.675 --> 01:22:29.708]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes and servicing debt?
[01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:38.296]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:39.637]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:39.637 --> 01:22:44.042]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.123]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.123 --> 01:22:46.104]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:22:46.104 --> 01:22:46.264]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:46.264 --> 01:22:46.484]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:46.484 --> 01:22:47.505]  Times are tough right now.
[01:23:03.851 --> 01:23:05.753]  How do you use gold when you're very sick?
[01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:19.854]  We're dead.
[01:23:19.854 --> 01:23:21.976]  Investing in precious metals is smart.
[01:23:21.976 --> 01:23:24.538]  Investing in your health could be smarter.
[01:23:24.538 --> 01:23:28.963]  Life Change Tea changes your life just by drinking our tea.
[01:23:28.963 --> 01:23:36.390]  Detox from deadly chemicals, flush poisons that cause harm to your organs, and lose unwanted pounds that bog you down.
[01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:37.391]  Call us.
[01:23:37.391 --> 01:23:37.772]  928-308-0408.
[01:23:37.772 --> 01:23:38.132]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[01:23:38.132 --> 01:23:39.654]  Or you can order online at GetTheTee.com.
[01:23:39.654 --> 01:23:40.916]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[01:23:40.916 --> 01:23:41.557]  Life Change Tee.
[01:23:41.557 --> 01:23:42.698]  We're changing lives.
[01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:18.486]  And if they gotta release a bioweapon to get the job done, they're gonna do it.
[01:24:34.574 --> 01:24:37.755]  All of their preparations are built around bio-attack.
[01:24:37.755 --> 01:24:44.938]  They stage the terror attacks to get the police state grid in place, so the good ol' boys think of the police states for foreigners.
[01:24:44.938 --> 01:24:50.980]  Then they secretly build it for gun owners, conservatives, veterans, now declassified as we told you.
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.741]  Ten years ago they were setting up.
[01:24:53.741 --> 01:24:59.343]  And then they stage bio-attacks, but I told you they would do some soft-kill, weak, beta-test first.
[01:24:59.343 --> 01:25:00.564]  And I believe this is a beta-test.
[01:25:01.423 --> 01:25:06.888]  And if people go along with this and they can practice world government control through this, the big ones are to come in the future.
[01:25:06.888 --> 01:25:13.453]  And then Napolitano at Homeland Security basically says that, oh this will probably peter out, but don't worry, a big mega death one is coming.
[01:25:13.453 --> 01:25:23.361]  I want to go back to Mexico City here briefly, but in closing, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, give people your website and comment on the things I was just saying.
[01:25:23.361 --> 01:25:24.202]  Do you concur with that?
[01:25:25.083 --> 01:25:27.124]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[01:25:27.124 --> 01:25:29.164]  There's two websites I want to give out to people.
[01:25:29.164 --> 01:25:30.945]  One is drtenpenny.com.
[01:25:30.945 --> 01:25:33.365]  D-R-T-E-N-P-E-N-N-Y.
[01:25:33.365 --> 01:25:35.026]  Drtenpenny.com.
[01:25:35.026 --> 01:25:37.386]  Tons of vaccine information and all these.
[01:25:37.386 --> 01:25:41.387]  And a recent article that I just wrote called Swine Flu, The New Bird Flu.
[01:25:41.387 --> 01:25:43.528]  That's available for free on the site.
[01:25:43.528 --> 01:25:45.369]  There's another site for my other book.
[01:25:45.369 --> 01:25:47.489]  It's called Saying No to Vaccines.
[01:25:47.489 --> 01:25:49.670]  And it's sayingnodovaccines.com.
[01:25:49.670 --> 01:25:53.091]  And the book, Foul Bird Flu, It's Not What You Think, was written in 2005.
[01:25:53.091 --> 01:25:53.451]  It's actually
[01:25:54.773 --> 01:25:57.374]  It's almost prophetic for the things that are happening right now.
[01:25:57.374 --> 01:25:58.814]  No, it's not almost prophetic.
[01:25:58.814 --> 01:26:00.215]  It is prophetic.
[01:26:00.215 --> 01:26:03.736]  It is prophetic for the things that are happening, and those are available on both sites.
[01:26:03.736 --> 01:26:09.638]  And I want to add, tonight I'm going to put up this pandemic plan that looks more like an action plan now, Alex.
[01:26:09.638 --> 01:26:14.199]  Because like we said, you know, USA Today says we're at level, at phase 4.
[01:26:14.199 --> 01:26:17.040]  Phase 5 is about going to mandatory vaccination.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:24.222]  Phase 6, and I'm reading it right from the document, says implement all relevant elements of national pandemic plan.
[01:26:24.702 --> 01:26:30.526]  Including applying emergency powers.
[01:26:30.526 --> 01:26:33.288]  I want to continue to get updates from you as this develops.
[01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:35.309]  It's so important throughout the week.
[01:26:35.309 --> 01:26:36.650]  When are you going to be getting home?
[01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:37.790]  Tonight?
[01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.993]  Actually, we're going to stay in San Antonio for a few days.
[01:26:40.993 --> 01:26:44.575]  So we'll be in San Antonio here actually until Saturday.
[01:26:46.095 --> 01:26:51.980]  Wow, maybe we could have a car come pick you up and have you drive up to Austin and be in the studio, but I don't want to.
[01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:56.884]  I know you were actually kind of halfway on vacation in Mexico, but we'll talk to you about that.
[01:26:56.884 --> 01:27:01.468]  I'll have my producer call you right now and try to set you up a couple times for the rest of the week.
[01:27:01.468 --> 01:27:05.812]  Let's go back, though, in the few minutes we've got left with the doctor to Justin in Mexico City.
[01:27:05.812 --> 01:27:08.374]  Again, we've confirmed he is in Mexico City.
[01:27:08.374 --> 01:27:10.616]  This is basically just confirming all the other reports.
[01:27:10.996 --> 01:27:13.037]  Getting out of Mexico City and surrounding areas.
[01:27:13.037 --> 01:27:23.103]  But we're also getting reports of even small coastal towns, areas where the people aren't chemicalized and aren't poisoned, where people are dying.
[01:27:23.103 --> 01:27:30.847]  So if it continues to be Hispanics that are mainly dying from this, even in the U.S., if we start seeing that pattern, this is clearly race specific.
[01:27:30.847 --> 01:27:33.408]  Dr. Tenpenny, do you have any comments on that?
[01:27:33.408 --> 01:27:36.089]  No, but that's a very interesting premise, Alex.
[01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:37.090]  That's very interesting.
[01:27:37.458 --> 01:27:44.563]  You've probably had a few people on your show over the years that were experts in things like chemtrails and things like that.
[01:27:44.563 --> 01:27:49.686]  I would be interested in knowing what their comments were about the possibility of this being spread through the air.
[01:27:49.686 --> 01:27:51.327]  It just seems too random to me.
[01:27:51.755 --> 01:27:57.297]  To be a face-to-face, person-to-person contracted virus, and that's just my opinion.
[01:27:57.297 --> 01:28:04.780]  Well, governments thousands of times have released chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on the public, including the U.S.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.581]  government, so they're the number one suspect.
[01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:12.003]  Any other key points that come to mind, Justin, in Mexico City?
[01:28:12.003 --> 01:28:16.425]  I guess I'm worried what's going to happen if they cut down all the transportation.
[01:28:16.425 --> 01:28:20.267]  How is the food going to come into Mexico City since they don't produce anything on their own?
[01:28:21.446 --> 01:28:22.022]  Great point.
[01:28:23.359 --> 01:28:32.966]  That's a really, really good point because as we know Mexico City is the largest city in the world and land surface area is huge and they don't grow any food there.
[01:28:32.966 --> 01:28:34.967]  That's a really excellent point.
[01:28:34.967 --> 01:28:50.658]  Why would they be, if this isn't some super mega death virus we're talking about, why are they acting, again they're talking out of both sides of their mouth, but through all this crisis we're going to pray for you and everybody down in Mexico City and all over the world where this is happening, but they're at the epicenter.
[01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.359]  Did you have a boy or girl, Justin?
[01:28:53.103 --> 01:28:54.123]  I grew up.
[01:28:54.123 --> 01:28:55.584]  Ah, congratulations.
[01:28:55.584 --> 01:28:56.424]  Thank you.
[01:28:56.424 --> 01:28:57.424]  Yeah, congratulations.
[01:28:57.424 --> 01:29:00.565]  My wife called up during the break and said, congratulate him on the baby.
[01:29:00.565 --> 01:29:04.207]  And don't vaccinate her.
[01:29:04.207 --> 01:29:05.227]  I won't.
[01:29:05.227 --> 01:29:05.527]  Good.
[01:29:05.527 --> 01:29:07.127]  Thanks.
[01:29:07.127 --> 01:29:08.668]  Did they try to vaccinate her at the hospital?
[01:29:09.921 --> 01:29:12.162]  I think she's too young to be vaccinated.
[01:29:12.162 --> 01:29:13.142]  Not here in America.
[01:29:13.142 --> 01:29:14.983]  They come in with multiple injectors.
[01:29:14.983 --> 01:29:20.264]  Yeah, they come in with the hepatitis B and the vitamin K at birth and then things start at 2, 4, and 6 months.
[01:29:20.264 --> 01:29:25.826]  And so you may want to get my book, Saying No to Vaccines, and learn some more about that before you decide to proceed.
[01:29:26.326 --> 01:29:27.367]  Okay, thank you.
[01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:29.388]  Doctor, thank you so much.
[01:29:29.388 --> 01:29:31.889]  Sherry Tenpenny, we'll talk to you very, very soon.
[01:29:31.889 --> 01:29:33.090]  Tomorrow, if you can do it, take care.
[01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:34.651]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:29:34.651 --> 01:29:35.071]  You bet.
[01:29:35.071 --> 01:29:36.372]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[01:29:36.372 --> 01:29:38.533]  More of your calls coming up.
[01:29:38.533 --> 01:29:42.016]  We'll stay in contact with our Mexico City correspondent down there.
[01:29:42.016 --> 01:29:44.717]  And we got Dr. Deagle coming up right now.
[01:29:44.717 --> 01:29:47.379]  And your calls.
[01:29:47.379 --> 01:29:48.760]  We're on the march.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.301]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.301 --> 01:29:54.003]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.301 --> 01:29:59.764]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[01:29:59.764 --> 01:30:03.568]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[01:30:03.568 --> 01:30:06.392]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[01:30:06.392 --> 01:30:13.580]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:14.200]  We're good to go.
[01:30:30.168 --> 01:30:34.330]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:40.134]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnobel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:45.177]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[01:30:45.177 --> 01:30:49.619]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:30:49.619 --> 01:30:52.281]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:52.741]  Call 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[01:30:57.617 --> 01:31:03.425]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:03.425 --> 01:31:10.434]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:11.002 --> 01:31:17.588]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:17.588 --> 01:31:19.570]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:19.570 --> 01:31:22.073]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:22.073 --> 01:31:32.943]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:35.290]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:37.151]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:37.151 --> 01:31:44.072]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:31:44.072 --> 01:31:52.334]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:52.334 --> 01:31:53.895]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:53.895 --> 01:31:55.095]  The people strike back.
[01:31:57.543 --> 01:32:03.048]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[01:32:03.048 --> 01:32:03.829]  and the world.
[01:32:03.829 --> 01:32:07.712]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[01:32:07.712 --> 01:32:14.217]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[01:32:14.217 --> 01:32:16.239]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:24.186]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[01:32:24.446 --> 01:32:29.149]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:34.973]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[01:32:34.973 --> 01:32:37.134]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[01:32:37.134 --> 01:32:39.396]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[01:32:39.736 --> 01:32:40.817]  Free of charge.
[01:32:40.817 --> 01:32:41.158]  Dial 1-800-453-2202.
[01:32:41.158 --> 01:32:41.238]  1-800-453-2202.
[01:32:41.238 --> 01:32:42.780]  Or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:43.361]  Factory direct.
[01:32:43.361 --> 01:32:44.923]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.
[01:32:44.923 --> 01:32:45.283]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[01:33:09.591 --> 01:33:17.535]  That was disconcerting because Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, you know, was saying she thought this was a bunch of hype yesterday.
[01:33:17.535 --> 01:33:18.576]  She didn't think that anymore.
[01:33:18.576 --> 01:33:22.538]  She thinks the new order's making its move.
[01:33:22.538 --> 01:33:24.419]  The next 30 minutes we got Dr. Deagle on with us.
[01:33:24.419 --> 01:33:29.261]  We got Dr. Rebecca Carley coming up in the last hour, but the whole next hour we'll be up on phones.
[01:33:29.261 --> 01:33:31.883]  In fact, I'm gonna take calls with Dr. Deagle right now.
[01:33:31.883 --> 01:33:32.103]  Matt,
[01:33:33.061 --> 01:33:34.582]  In England, Matt in the UK.
[01:33:34.582 --> 01:33:36.822]  I have two Matts from the UK?
[01:33:36.822 --> 01:33:41.624]  Tom in Texas, Chris in Wisconsin, Bill in Iowa.
[01:33:41.624 --> 01:33:47.406]  It's like getting three cherries on a slot machine or something to have two Matts from the UK.
[01:33:47.406 --> 01:33:48.607]  I don't gamble folks, that's a joke.
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:52.140]  I don't gamble in life.
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.402]  I don't gamble in gambling with lottery tickets.
[01:33:54.402 --> 01:33:55.282]  I think it's ridiculous.
[01:33:55.282 --> 01:33:56.663]  But side issue here.
[01:33:56.663 --> 01:34:04.027]  We're also keeping on the line for a few more minutes Justin in Mexico because he's down there in Mexico City.
[01:34:04.027 --> 01:34:11.492]  He was just in a hospital for three days with his wife giving birth to a baby girl and they were saying 20 people died there of a respiratory illness.
[01:34:11.492 --> 01:34:14.874]  Another person they quote said was flu but flu is respiratory by its very nature.
[01:34:16.704 --> 01:34:19.090]  At least in the autoimmune over-response.
[01:34:19.090 --> 01:34:21.275]  So we're going to talk to Dr. Deagle here in just a moment.
[01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:35.727]  I just hope this is them fear-mongering to sell a bunch of vaccines and Tamiflu and to try to forcibly inoculate folks to try to set that precedent as Time Magazine, Newsweek, and others are doing.
[01:34:35.727 --> 01:34:40.851]  I hope they're not really moving with something that's going to kill a bunch of people better than a hammer and so it can spread real good.
[01:34:40.851 --> 01:34:43.874]  They're just kind of covering up how dangerous it really is.
[01:34:43.874 --> 01:34:46.856]  I hope this is just hype, like Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:34:46.856 --> 01:34:48.557]  It was a staged terror attack.
[01:34:48.557 --> 01:34:49.618]  No one attacked the ship.
[01:34:49.618 --> 01:34:51.480]  They just said it was attacked and then launched the war.
[01:34:52.671 --> 01:34:58.612]  I hope this is just a staged event where they're just over-hyping it to get the fear and expand their New World Order.
[01:34:58.612 --> 01:35:00.192]  You know, that's a lesser of two evils.
[01:35:00.192 --> 01:35:03.353]  I hope they haven't really launched a hot weapon.
[01:35:03.353 --> 01:35:06.773]  Let's play now, because I keep talking about it, that CNN clip.
[01:35:06.773 --> 01:35:11.374]  This is General, multi-star General.
[01:35:11.374 --> 01:35:14.055]  Let me pull that up.
[01:35:14.055 --> 01:35:20.536]  I actually got that up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:20.536 --> 01:35:21.196]  Top General.
[01:35:22.688 --> 01:35:33.658]  Before I go to Dr. Deagle and your calls, I do want to encourage listeners to continue to spread the word about this radio show.
[01:35:45.717 --> 01:35:50.459]  Because we are watching and tracking and integrating all the information.
[01:35:50.459 --> 01:35:57.982]  I don't think there's really anywhere else where you're going to hear this many guests and this many calls and this much information and all angles, all
[01:35:59.178 --> 01:36:15.145]  Possibilities through a historical lens of who the globalists are, what they've done in the past, what they've done with vaccines in the past, how they released swine flu and bird flu in the past, how they've killed American citizens, troops and others with chemical and biological tests that everybody knows about.
[01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:17.746]  Most people know about four or five of the famous cases.
[01:36:17.746 --> 01:36:18.446]  There are thousands.
[01:36:20.558 --> 01:36:32.109]  This is the place, and see, this isn't a game, it isn't a joke, it's when people call in and say, I like this talk show host more, or I don't like the way you talk to callers, or, you know, do you work for the Tooth Fairy?
[01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:33.750]  I go, look, it isn't about me!
[01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:44.160]  These are globalist mass murderers, you can debate all day who runs the New World Order, the point is the globalists want to carry out a giant eugenics operation and exterminate the majority of the planet on record.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.581]  And we've got to face what these killers are saying.
[01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:47.761]  They funded Hitler.
[01:36:47.761 --> 01:36:48.662]  They funded Stalin.
[01:36:48.662 --> 01:36:49.382]  They funded Mao.
[01:36:49.382 --> 01:36:50.923]  They funded Pol Pot.
[01:36:50.923 --> 01:36:59.587]  And the guy that brags he funded Pol Pot is the advisor to Obama, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and his daughters, the anchor on MSNBC with Joe Scarborough.
[01:36:59.587 --> 01:37:02.228]  These people are up there running things!
[01:37:02.228 --> 01:37:04.449]  And they mean business!
[01:37:04.449 --> 01:37:06.010]  This is the real world!
[01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:11.612]  I'm thinking about the New World Order setting me up or killing me, or my family dying of bioweapon attacks.
[01:37:11.612 --> 01:37:13.633]  That's why I come in here and work 18 hours a day.
[01:37:14.574 --> 01:37:18.857]  That's why I worked till 4.30 in the morning last night and got three hours sleep.
[01:37:18.857 --> 01:37:20.338]  And I don't deserve your thanks.
[01:37:20.338 --> 01:37:21.438]  I don't want your thanks.
[01:37:21.438 --> 01:37:25.100]  I know I'm taking up some of Deagle's time.
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:26.741]  We'll hold him over the next hour if we can do it.
[01:37:26.741 --> 01:37:30.564]  The point here is, this isn't a joke!
[01:37:30.564 --> 01:37:31.925]  This isn't a game, people!
[01:37:33.413 --> 01:37:38.635]  And all the infighting, all the little patriot groups, it's like a peanut gallery and a popularity contest.
[01:37:38.635 --> 01:37:52.540]  You boys and girls who sit around infighting and sniping and everybody shouldn't be in this movement if you don't grow up and put on the big boy pants and get out of your diapers and realize you have joined a life and death situation.
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:53.781]  You're on the front lines.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.461]  You might as well gut up and grow up.
[01:37:58.461 --> 01:38:04.024]  We need every person to get serious, to get focused, and expose the globalist, the eugenics agenda.
[01:38:04.024 --> 01:38:11.389]  That's why Endgame is the most important film, bar none, ever produced about the New World Order and the systems that control us.
[01:38:11.389 --> 01:38:16.092]  Because it integrates their history, who they are, what their goals are, and what they're going to do.
[01:38:16.092 --> 01:38:19.114]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:38:19.114 --> 01:38:22.636]  It's free on YouTube and Google.
[01:38:22.636 --> 01:38:24.097]  Email it to everybody now.
[01:38:25.689 --> 01:38:26.770]  Obama deception!
[01:38:26.770 --> 01:38:28.751]  It's free on YouTube and Google.
[01:38:28.751 --> 01:38:31.093]  The YouTube version's got a million six hundred thousand views.
[01:38:31.093 --> 01:38:34.875]  It's over fifteen million views last time I counted it up total that I saw.
[01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:40.959]  But that high quality one, uh, one YouTube channel, somebody did a great upload of it, changed the channel's the name of the channel.
[01:38:40.959 --> 01:38:42.180]  It's not my channel.
[01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:43.701]  He's got a director's account.
[01:38:43.701 --> 01:38:45.342]  You know, the full two hour film's up there.
[01:38:45.342 --> 01:38:46.383]  Super high quality.
[01:38:46.383 --> 01:38:47.844]  Get it out to everybody!
[01:38:47.844 --> 01:38:52.367]  Sure, I know you know about the New World Order listeners, but your neighbor doesn't.
[01:38:52.367 --> 01:38:54.088]  And they're finally ready to hear the truth.
[01:38:54.088 --> 01:38:55.069]  They're finally ready!
[01:38:56.029 --> 01:39:12.302]  If we don't have a massive awakening, a renaissance, a revelation, a enlightenment about how the world really works, and if we don't get past the puppets of left-right paradigm, the globalists are going to win!
[01:39:12.302 --> 01:39:14.844]  This is a beta test, I have no doubt.
[01:39:14.844 --> 01:39:23.090]  And it's the police state and the crackdown on the vaccine that comes that I see in my gut, in the analysis, and the final equation is the real threat.
[01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.151]  This is the beginning.
[01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:30.392]  Of things that come that are very bad.
[01:39:30.392 --> 01:39:37.477]  And all the left-right baloney, all the fake conservatism, all the fake liberalism goes out the window when the new ruler drops the hammer.
[01:39:37.477 --> 01:39:44.121]  So listen, go to InfoWars.com, get the Patriot t-shirts, spread the word so you can meet like-minded people on the street.
[01:39:44.121 --> 01:39:47.002]  Like live free or die with the Minutemen on the front.
[01:39:47.002 --> 01:39:47.863]  This is our uniform.
[01:39:49.246 --> 01:39:50.287]  Come and take it.
[01:39:50.287 --> 01:39:53.229]  They're going to try gun confiscation during a complete collapse.
[01:39:53.229 --> 01:39:54.710]  They can do that under these executive orders.
[01:39:54.710 --> 01:39:55.911]  We're in trouble, folks.
[01:39:55.911 --> 01:39:57.392]  It's happening.
[01:39:57.392 --> 01:39:58.452]  This is the real world.
[01:39:58.452 --> 01:40:04.356]  The globalists killed 60-plus million people over the 40 years of purges in Russia.
[01:40:04.356 --> 01:40:07.338]  60-plus million in just a few years of purges in China.
[01:40:07.338 --> 01:40:08.399]  They mean business.
[01:40:08.399 --> 01:40:10.861]  The same people run what's happening here now.
[01:40:10.861 --> 01:40:15.064]  And they want to massive purge, re-engineer this society, and gut out the middle class.
[01:40:17.065 --> 01:40:19.726]  So I'm telling you, go get the Obama Deception on DVD.
[01:40:19.726 --> 01:40:20.946]  Get Endgame on DVD.
[01:40:20.946 --> 01:40:22.226]  Show it to your church.
[01:40:22.226 --> 01:40:23.667]  Show it to your neighbors.
[01:40:23.667 --> 01:40:24.767]  Get it out to people.
[01:40:24.767 --> 01:40:26.148]  Buy a DVD burner.
[01:40:26.148 --> 01:40:31.309]  Make copies of it!
[01:40:31.309 --> 01:40:33.089]  Infowars.com is the website.
[01:40:33.089 --> 01:40:36.891]  I'll also tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[01:40:36.891 --> 01:40:39.111]  One of them is SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:40:39.111 --> 01:40:45.513]  In a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[01:40:47.534 --> 01:40:52.636]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds are the highest value of any barter item, even silver or gold.
[01:40:52.636 --> 01:40:57.958]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, who want to control us by controlling the food supply.
[01:40:57.958 --> 01:41:03.201]  Governments are storing seeds, the UN is storing seeds, globals from every stripe are storing seeds near the Arctic Circle.
[01:41:03.201 --> 01:41:04.621]  Why do you think this is?
[01:41:04.621 --> 01:41:05.261]  You know why.
[01:41:05.261 --> 01:41:07.042]  Control and power.
[01:41:07.042 --> 01:41:11.424]  Solutions from science is trying to get seeds out of the globalist's hands and into the hands of the people.
[01:41:11.424 --> 01:41:12.684]  One seed bank at a time.
[01:41:12.684 --> 01:41:13.485]  One family at a time.
[01:41:14.244 --> 01:41:21.050]  The Survival Seed Bank from Solutions for Science contains enough open-pollinated seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:25.374]  Seeds in the Survival Seed Bank are hand-picked for exceptional germination rates.
[01:41:25.374 --> 01:41:27.876]  SurvivalSeedBank.com, SurvivalSeedBank.com or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[01:41:34.562 --> 01:41:36.624]  One other sponsor for these crazy times.
[01:41:36.624 --> 01:41:41.568]  If you're afraid of firearms, you've been gelded, you were never trained on them, go buy a firearm, get some training.
[01:41:41.568 --> 01:41:47.813]  But if you're not gonna do that, or you got children in the house, this is, you know, we got our stuff locked up in pistol safes.
[01:41:48.953 --> 01:41:55.757]  But we also have pepper spray on top of bookshelves and things, so if they did climb up and accidentally get it, it wouldn't be too, you know, it wouldn't kill them.
[01:41:55.757 --> 01:41:59.060]  But they've been taught not to touch it anyway, so it doesn't matter.
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:01.021]  But the best thing to have is pepper spray.
[01:42:01.021 --> 01:42:03.903]  You got a daughter you're sending to college, your wife, whatever.
[01:42:03.903 --> 01:42:10.407]  They got high quality pepper spray, stun guns, tasers, animal repellents, home safety, personal alarms, pepperspray.com.
[01:42:10.407 --> 01:42:14.870]  Pepperspray.com, the best prices around since 1994 on the internet, before that.
[01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:16.552]  As a store, 800-908-9988, 800-908-9988, Pepperspray.com, 800-908-9988.
[01:42:16.552 --> 01:42:18.155]  Get prepared with non-lethal weapons, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:28.217 --> 01:42:28.677]  Okay?
[01:42:28.677 --> 01:42:29.698]  Arm yourselves.
[01:42:29.698 --> 01:42:36.263]  And in areas where they've got basic gun bands on, most of those places allow pepper spray and things like that, or stun guns or tasers.
[01:42:36.263 --> 01:42:37.784]  You've got to check your laws.
[01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:39.945]  The point is, get these systems now.
[01:42:39.945 --> 01:42:40.966]  I believe in it.
[01:42:40.966 --> 01:42:41.867]  Pepperspray.com.
[01:42:41.867 --> 01:42:42.607]  Okay.
[01:42:42.607 --> 01:42:53.795]  That said, I want to go to a bunch of callers here, people in England, you name it, and Dr. D., I'll hold you over a little bit in the next hour so we're going to have plenty of time for you to be able to put out the latest developments since you were on with us yesterday.
[01:42:54.756 --> 01:43:01.320]  And we've got Dr. Rebecca Carley joining us at 2 o'clock central, coming up in an hour and 15 minutes, an hour and 17 minutes to be technical.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:07.764]  But just in a brief summation, in the last 24 hours since you were on with us, a lot of new developments have happened.
[01:43:07.764 --> 01:43:09.845]  They've gone to level 4.
[01:43:09.845 --> 01:43:12.406]  The next level is basically Marshall Lobb.
[01:43:12.406 --> 01:43:14.047]  Forts inoculations are beginning.
[01:43:14.047 --> 01:43:16.549]  Texas counties plan mass vaccinations in March.
[01:43:19.069 --> 01:43:20.190]  That's being reported.
[01:43:20.190 --> 01:43:24.694]  Guadalupe County, Texas had prepared for mass vaccinations program in the event of a pandemic.
[01:43:24.694 --> 01:43:30.419]  Local officials have 36 hours to treat their entire population in Guadalupe County.
[01:43:30.419 --> 01:43:32.621]  Will be 115,000 people.
[01:43:32.621 --> 01:43:36.284]  Ron Maloney writes for the local newspaper.
[01:43:36.284 --> 01:43:39.387]  So this was already going on before.
[01:43:39.387 --> 01:43:41.248]  See, we saw this massive mobilization
[01:43:41.989 --> 01:43:50.496]  Before all this broke and before all this started, and then getting ready all these mass graves, Dr. Deagle, I hope to God this isn't it.
[01:43:50.496 --> 01:43:58.262]  Uh, well, there's, um, this is the beginning of the end, and, uh, I don't think that we have one strain of virus present.
[01:43:58.262 --> 01:44:01.685]  I'm pretty certain we have more than one substrain.
[01:44:01.685 --> 01:44:06.469]  Uh, the cases in America right now, as far as I know, there's no confirmed deaths.
[01:44:06.469 --> 01:44:10.472]  The cases in Mexico City, whether it's due to the toxicity or malnutrition,
[01:44:10.930 --> 01:44:19.698]  There's almost certainly a different strain there and a report I have is that half of the cases are this lethal strain and the other half is the same strain.
[01:44:20.259 --> 01:44:22.780]  As in the United States and Canada.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:30.604]  So what we're dealing with is... But that lethal strain is going to get here, and even if it's race-specific, you know, the country's 15% and growing Hispanic.
[01:44:30.604 --> 01:44:31.224]  Right.
[01:44:31.224 --> 01:44:33.845]  We're going to find out if it's race-specific real fast.
[01:44:33.845 --> 01:44:34.385]  Absolutely.
[01:44:34.385 --> 01:44:49.032]  In fact, you've got to stand back a bit and listen to the reports that Dr. H. Rowatt reported about General Qi Haoxian in 2005, that the Chinese were planning and plotting on an invasion of North America.
[01:44:49.594 --> 01:44:55.759]  And if I was picking a land to invade, I wouldn't be invading the cold white north of Canada, I'd be invading Mexico first.
[01:44:55.759 --> 01:45:00.062]  And I'd be clearing out the population of Hispanic peoples in Mexico and America.
[01:45:00.598 --> 01:45:03.440]  If I was planning on a eugenics policy.
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:15.030]  Now wouldn't a general eugenics, a rare specific bioweapon kill Chinese and kill Mexicans because Mexicans are a Spanish slash Asian, Asiatic mix from over the Bering Strait?
[01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:17.132]  I'm getting an echo off his line.
[01:45:17.132 --> 01:45:18.793]  We might want to check that Genesis.
[01:45:18.793 --> 01:45:19.634]  Go ahead.
[01:45:19.634 --> 01:45:20.735]  Yeah, it's possible.
[01:45:20.735 --> 01:45:28.862]  Again, I think that one of the problems that we often see is the globalists and their scientific, you know, brainiacs
[01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:34.312]  Think somehow they're in control of the chaos and this is a form of chaos.
[01:45:34.312 --> 01:45:39.234]  I like to refer to this as the lab recombinant hybrid virus.
[01:45:39.234 --> 01:45:50.600]  They don't like to call it swine flu because swine flu virus doesn't kill pigs or pig workers and 20% of veterinarians carry antibodies and 25% of pig workers carry antibodies and it doesn't cause death.
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.322]  This is a recombinant virus that's a bridge.
[01:45:53.322 --> 01:45:57.164]  The best way to describe this is they've blown up the world now with a viral load
[01:45:57.631 --> 01:45:58.551]  We're good to go!
[01:46:27.179 --> 01:46:29.340]  Human, swine, etc.
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:36.123]  What this virus is, it's a bridge to allow to jump into humans and other animals like cattle, sheep, horses.
[01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:41.705]  So, I think the first way we see in America, none of the actions that should have been done are done.
[01:46:41.705 --> 01:46:49.928]  Right now, what they should be doing is moving in with large heavy lift aircraft to give things to the host population so that the virus doesn't spread.
[01:46:49.928 --> 01:46:54.490]  For example, one of the things that I recommended years ago, and we talked about this with
[01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:56.411]  I don't think so.
[01:47:25.333 --> 01:47:32.860]  They're actually inserting attenuated virus that's actually going to add new genetic material to cause new super substrains to emerge.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:42.688]  When they give the oseltamivir or Tamiflu, within four days, whatever little bit of virus that's still sensitive will become totally resistant.
[01:47:42.688 --> 01:47:53.017]  Just like Dr. Sherry Tenpenny says, if you have a population that's sickened by starvation because of current famine in different countries, the host of it's got more free radicals of a person starving
[01:47:53.522 --> 01:47:55.584]  It makes the virus more aggressive.
[01:47:55.584 --> 01:48:01.968]  Doctor, why is Tamiflu, the Japanese government's admitted, causing people to commit suicide and have psychotic breaks?
[01:48:01.968 --> 01:48:09.194]  Because the process by which they make Tamiflu generates a hallucinogen that's very much like LSD or angel dust.
[01:48:09.194 --> 01:48:12.436]  It's identical in its effect on the brain to angel dust.
[01:48:12.436 --> 01:48:17.480]  I don't think you want to put angel dust in your mouth when you think, or give it to your police forces.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.662]  So now all of a sudden you're going to put your police and military on angel dust.
[01:48:21.155 --> 01:48:21.795]  We're good to go.
[01:48:50.285 --> 01:48:52.946]  Their plan is to activate detention camps.
[01:48:52.946 --> 01:48:59.447]  I've talked to military personnel recently who've given me information that they have 50,000 returning U.S.
[01:48:59.447 --> 01:49:06.128]  troops now trained at an enormous pace since January, since the inauguration of the usurper-in-chief.
[01:49:06.128 --> 01:49:09.669]  They've been training them for riot control under the Declaration of Sunday.
[01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:12.370]  This is not even rumor or secret sources.
[01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:16.150]  They admit they've implemented a civil emergency.
[01:49:16.150 --> 01:49:17.711]  They've now taken the gloves off.
[01:49:17.711 --> 01:49:18.291]  The question is
[01:49:19.235 --> 01:49:21.316]  How much of it will they actually implement?
[01:49:21.316 --> 01:49:23.458]  But no, we're now under martial law.
[01:49:23.458 --> 01:49:31.503]  I got a, I got a Homeland Security whistleblower who sent me actual pictures of the bio-suits they have, and they're called a Chem-Pak, No-Mak suit.
[01:49:31.503 --> 01:49:34.025]  It was Flak Jacket, Scott Air Pack, etc.
[01:49:34.025 --> 01:49:37.728]  And the internal documents, they're getting ready right now for Level 5.
[01:49:37.728 --> 01:49:39.489]  And when they go to Level 5... No, I got them too.
[01:49:39.489 --> 01:49:40.630]  It says it right here.
[01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:46.354]  I've got the Homeland Defender and the Homeland Security report here in front of me.
[01:49:47.219 --> 01:49:49.100]  They're getting ready.
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:59.507]  To be honest with you, if you actually look at the definitions of World Health Organizations, if you have consistent spread among continents and human-to-human spread in large clusters, you are at Level 5.
[01:49:59.507 --> 01:50:03.830]  So when they declare that the World Health Organization moved from Level 3 to 4, they're liars.
[01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:14.217]  And when they go to Level 5, which is what they should be actually at right now, the Patriot Act and all those other acts that are executive orders that were put in by the last moron in the White House,
[01:50:14.838 --> 01:50:15.659]  I don't think so.
[01:50:32.558 --> 01:50:33.638]  Uh, they're going to increase vaccines.
[01:50:33.638 --> 01:50:33.939]  And the U.N.'
[01:50:33.918 --> 01:50:47.423]  's running this on record, mainstream news reports, and they've been caught adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women, putting HIV in shots, and so I would think the real bio-attack will be the vaccine, Dr. Deagle.
[01:50:47.423 --> 01:50:49.344]  Oh, it's going to amplify tremendously.
[01:50:49.344 --> 01:50:53.885]  If this gets done and they move to the next level, things are going to really take off.
[01:50:53.885 --> 01:50:54.745]  Alright, stay there.
[01:50:54.745 --> 01:50:56.306]  Phone calls are coming up and a lot more.
[01:50:57.532 --> 01:51:03.757]  If you've always wanted to experience the amazing benefits from using oil of oregano, the time to act is now.

[01:51:51.083 --> 01:51:54.846]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:03.795 --> 01:52:09.678]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:09.678 --> 01:52:16.182]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:16.182 --> 01:52:18.143]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:18.143 --> 01:52:20.604]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[01:52:20.604 --> 01:52:31.510]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.461]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:35.461 --> 01:52:37.323]  It's about a one world government.
[01:52:37.323 --> 01:52:44.229]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:54:22.931 --> 01:54:28.676]  Let's go ahead and go to Matt in England.
[01:54:28.676 --> 01:54:34.220]  Justin's still there, we'll get Neagle coming up in the next hour, ask some questions of him.
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.122]  But Matt in England, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:54:37.950 --> 01:54:38.850]  Uh, hello?
[01:54:38.850 --> 01:54:40.431]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:54:40.431 --> 01:54:41.291]  Hey, you alright, Alex?
[01:54:41.291 --> 01:54:43.472]  Um, I've got something you might find interesting.
[01:54:43.472 --> 01:54:56.318]  My mother, she works in a nursing home, and, uh, one girl she works with, her sister, has been, got some bad flu or something, has been quarantined off in Scotland, and apparently they gave her some, like, strange vaccination.
[01:54:56.318 --> 01:55:04.441]  I'm not sure how true it is, but my mum's saying that, I don't know, it's quite... I don't know, have you heard anything about what's going on in England at all?
[01:55:05.046 --> 01:55:06.667]  Well, there's a lot of weirdness going on.
[01:55:06.667 --> 01:55:07.528]  Let's bring that up.
[01:55:07.528 --> 01:55:23.398]  And to Dr. Deagle, there's Spiegel's reporting in Switzerland, a train in a car with passengers, quote, a bird flu vaccine, excuse me, swine flu vaccine explodes on the train.
[01:55:23.398 --> 01:55:25.099]  I mean, what does that even mean?
[01:55:25.099 --> 01:55:28.461]  Yeah, actually, I got I got a copy of that report.
[01:55:28.461 --> 01:55:34.345]  It's a container of the flu virus samples packed in dry ice exploded on a Swiss train reported in Reuters.
[01:55:35.151 --> 01:55:39.912]  And apparently it was a box of the swine flu virus that was in the vaccine.
[01:55:39.912 --> 01:55:43.153]  And it's a different strain than the H1N1.
[01:55:43.153 --> 01:55:46.674]  Now, one of the problems is the misnomers are calling it a swine flu.
[01:55:46.674 --> 01:55:48.155]  This isn't swine flu.
[01:55:48.155 --> 01:55:59.518]  This is a recombinant lab flu that was probably sprayed by a PSYOP group that sprayed it on the population on the garbage heap around New Mexico City.
[01:55:59.518 --> 01:56:02.039]  So this is very timely because
[01:56:02.779 --> 01:56:05.640]  Geneva, Switzerland is the headquarters of the World Health Organization.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.380]  I call them Doctor Who.
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:16.401]  In 1997, I spoke in Zurich against fetal tissue transplants and the Super Soldier program privately to the board of the Human Life International.
[01:56:16.401 --> 01:56:21.822]  They took me aside after the meeting, gave me a foot of documents, and spent hours explaining the three projects.
[01:56:21.822 --> 01:56:31.404]  One of them was to create a super virus by resurrecting gene fragments from the 1918 flu with deceased whalers dead in the permafrost, pulling out their lungs,
[01:56:31.923 --> 01:56:46.866]  Dissecting the virus and then literally creating with a supercomputer a resurrected 1918 pandemic, which is a recombinant of WSN-33 and the oldest Iowa flu strains in our database.
[01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:55.387]  This recombinant was created when they created a typhus vaccine that they passed through pigs that had the pig flu, and it infected our troops.
[01:56:55.387 --> 01:57:01.308]  There were troop transports, very, very sick and tired, flying to Spain, and that's why they call it the Spanish flu.
[01:57:02.025 --> 01:57:03.486]  They have resurrected this.
[01:57:03.486 --> 01:57:08.790]  They then added avian genes, sprayed it, and they told me these documents in 97 that they actually were in the process.
[01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:11.051]  They had funding from the Rothschilds.
[01:57:11.051 --> 01:57:14.774]  The United Nations and World Health Organization were overseeing the whole project.
[01:57:14.774 --> 01:57:29.624]  The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, the CDC, and USAMRID were all involved, and there were four countries, Israel, Britain, Canada, and America, making these viruses, and that's why they killed so many
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:55.931]  specialists and scientists and even uh... doctoral students they're working on the flu that's what i mean let me stop you and back you up on that uh... this is uh... from cidrep.umn.edu uh... this is from a university uh... cdc press releases put out by the cdc and this is from january fourteenth two thousand four
[01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:57.570]  No, man.
[01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:58.271]  That's cool, man.
[01:57:58.271 --> 01:57:58.811]  Take it easy.
[01:58:25.578 --> 01:58:30.300]  Drink plenty of vitamin C and hope they haven't released the big one on us, these murdering pieces of filth.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:32.261]  There's no doubt this is a designer virus.
[01:58:32.261 --> 01:58:38.564]  The only question is, is it a mega death killer?
[01:58:38.564 --> 01:58:41.986]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:53.574]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[01:58:53.574 --> 01:58:56.538]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.

[01:59:04.528 --> 01:59:05.649]  If you simply prepare.
[01:59:05.649 --> 01:59:08.892]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[01:59:49.901 --> 01:59:52.302]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:52.302 --> 02:00:01.608]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.608 --> 02:00:02.908]  Big Brother.
[02:00:02.908 --> 02:00:04.689]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:04.689 --> 02:00:06.430]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:08.011]  You want answers?
[02:00:08.011 --> 02:00:08.952]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:08.952 --> 02:00:13.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:13.755 --> 02:00:17.817]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.846 --> 02:00:25.811]  It is an incontrovertible fact that eugenicists believe in exterminating at least 80% of the world population.
[02:00:25.811 --> 02:00:31.335]  Official United Nations Law, Biological Diversity Assessment and Policy, 1996.
[02:00:31.335 --> 02:00:40.483]  Covered in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and of course in my 2002 film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:00:40.483 --> 02:00:44.626]  We have the video of the photocopies of the official UN Biological Diversity Assessment.
[02:00:45.620 --> 02:00:46.761]  And I'm going to get more into it.
[02:00:46.761 --> 02:00:54.690]  You should just go to the official UN website and read it for yourself or you're not going to believe me if I tell you what else it says.
[02:00:54.690 --> 02:00:55.311]  I'll tell you.
[02:00:55.311 --> 02:00:59.956]  It goes ahead and says they want a devil worship and that they want to set up Aztec sacrifice centers.
[02:00:59.956 --> 02:01:02.438]  You cannot make it up!
[02:01:02.438 --> 02:01:04.120]  I know it's insane.
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:05.562]  It is insane.
[02:01:05.562 --> 02:01:06.383]  But go read it!
[02:01:07.523 --> 02:01:09.405]  These people are out of their minds.
[02:01:09.405 --> 02:01:16.851]  I mean, it sounds crazy to say Ted Turner's saying, get rid of the useless eaters, and Prince Philip says he wants to kill us, and can't wait to release deadly viruses.
[02:01:16.851 --> 02:01:18.973]  But they write books saying this!
[02:01:18.973 --> 02:01:21.214]  The Club of Rome!
[02:01:21.214 --> 02:01:22.896]  They are moving with their carbon taxes.
[02:01:22.896 --> 02:01:25.258]  They're moving with their global government.
[02:01:25.258 --> 02:01:31.403]  And they need to collapse everything and have a smoke screen to get that job done.
[02:01:31.403 --> 02:01:34.466]  These people are out of their minds.
[02:01:36.274 --> 02:01:37.835]  Let's go to Matt in the UK.
[02:01:37.835 --> 02:01:38.476]  Another Matt.
[02:01:38.476 --> 02:01:41.017]  Matt, you're on the air with Dr. Deagle.
[02:01:41.017 --> 02:01:42.538]  How you doing?
[02:01:42.538 --> 02:01:46.621]  From a parent to a parent, I really do hope this is hype, Alex.
[02:01:46.621 --> 02:01:54.707]  First of all, my thesis from the UK is, remember the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK?
[02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:57.368]  That was all majorly hyped up and they slaughtered a lot of cattle.
[02:01:57.368 --> 02:01:58.569]  And it turned out it was the government.
[02:01:58.569 --> 02:02:00.811]  The government admits they released foot and mouth.
[02:02:00.811 --> 02:02:05.554]  Yeah, but basically they put a lot of people out of business, the farmers went bust, a lot of suicides.
[02:02:06.112 --> 02:02:18.315]  What I think they're gonna do is to hype this up in the UK, is what they'll do is they'll kill all the livestock, the pigs, indefinitely, and that'll create a worldwide economic slump.
[02:02:18.315 --> 02:02:28.418]  Yeah, Germany, Russia, they're all banning US pork, and Russia's banning all our meats, basically, and it's all absolute hype.
[02:02:28.418 --> 02:02:30.798]  The pigs aren't sick, it's not... Dr. Deagle?
[02:02:30.798 --> 02:02:32.119]  It doesn't do a thing to the pigs.
[02:02:32.119 --> 02:02:33.919]  What happened at Porton Down, the facility?
[02:02:34.531 --> 02:02:34.731]  I think?
[02:02:48.547 --> 02:02:50.648]  Foot and most disease get out to the local cattle.
[02:02:50.648 --> 02:02:53.649]  I guarantee you, it was a forced release.
[02:02:53.649 --> 02:02:55.270]  And what they really wanted... Wait, wait, wait!
[02:02:55.270 --> 02:03:02.932]  They admit in the BBC, months after we were writing it was, that in two days it shows up all over England in cows and sheep.
[02:03:02.932 --> 02:03:06.454]  And then they said, oh, some environmentalist that works here must have stolen it.
[02:03:06.454 --> 02:03:07.274]  Oh yeah, right.
[02:03:07.274 --> 02:03:10.055]  No, the government had to spread that.
[02:03:10.055 --> 02:03:10.475]  Exactly.
[02:03:10.475 --> 02:03:17.118]  Just like the anthrax strain that got out during the thing right after 9-11.
[02:03:18.602 --> 02:03:21.064]  Was a weaponized strain from Ames, Iowa.
[02:03:21.064 --> 02:03:24.647]  Now, here's the thing people need to grasp, and I'm very concerned about this.
[02:03:24.647 --> 02:03:29.471]  This latest strain isn't just a, quote, a swine flu.
[02:03:29.471 --> 02:03:32.754]  This is a virus that can leap into horses and cattle.
[02:03:32.754 --> 02:03:42.442]  And if it gets into farms of other, quote, meat crops like, you know, not just chickens, but also, say, into cattle and so on, this could wipe entire herds out.
[02:03:42.442 --> 02:03:45.645]  And I believe that what they're trying to do is they want to cut off food supply
[02:03:46.172 --> 02:03:58.637]  The economics of what's going on right now worldwide since the collapse of the world economy and the disappearance of wealth is that we currently have an economy worldwide that can support 5 billion people out of 6.5 billion.
[02:03:58.637 --> 02:04:03.939]  So a billion and a half quarter excess population according to the globalists because they're ready to proceed.
[02:04:03.939 --> 02:04:06.160]  And I think this is the beginning of the end.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.921]  I think they want to have a false peace treaty very soon.
[02:04:08.921 --> 02:04:15.084]  I think that this is a dry run, but in days, weeks, or months, maybe perhaps by September
[02:04:15.859 --> 02:04:21.824]  Uh, Henry Kissinger said in Europe that he was expecting America to be disarmed by the fall, by September.
[02:04:21.824 --> 02:04:30.111]  I believe that they're planning on having a release enough that they can activate, even if there's not many deaths, martial law and grabbing people's guns.
[02:04:30.111 --> 02:04:30.571]  Okay.
[02:04:30.571 --> 02:04:33.534]  Uh, Matt in the UK, anything else?
[02:04:33.534 --> 02:04:33.734]  Yeah.
[02:04:33.734 --> 02:04:42.561]  Um, well, I was going to say that on the final point, I, I reckon one of those things I mentioned about the, the, the slot of the pigs and everything else, and it'd be a precedent, precedent to actually bring in GMO.
[02:04:42.561 --> 02:04:43.161]  What do you reckon on that?
[02:04:43.161 --> 02:04:44.022]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:44.022 --> 02:04:44.943]  I think that you're right on.
[02:04:45.441 --> 02:04:50.382]  They want to have an answer, that GMO's the answer to the famine, and that's weaponized foods that will destroy your health.
[02:04:50.382 --> 02:04:51.483]  Alright, stay there, stay there, stay there.
[02:04:51.483 --> 02:04:52.503]  We got a break.
[02:04:52.503 --> 02:04:54.464]  Come back, more of your phone calls straight ahead.
[02:04:54.464 --> 02:04:57.325]  I'm gonna get a take from Dr. Rebecca Carley later.
[02:04:57.325 --> 02:05:04.487]  You already know that drinking pure, high-alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high-energy and vibrant health.
[02:05:04.487 --> 02:05:08.708]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[02:05:09.028 --> 02:05:14.633]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[02:05:14.633 --> 02:05:22.180]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:27.084]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[02:05:27.544 --> 02:05:33.388]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[02:05:33.388 --> 02:05:39.192]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[02:05:39.192 --> 02:05:45.156]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.

[02:05:57.754 --> 02:06:03.013]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:03.798 --> 02:06:09.662]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:09.662 --> 02:06:16.106]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:16.106 --> 02:06:18.147]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:18.147 --> 02:06:20.609]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:06:20.609 --> 02:06:31.496]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.460]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:37.321]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:37.321 --> 02:06:44.223]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:06:52.485 --> 02:06:54.045]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:54.045 --> 02:06:58.866]  The people strike back.
[02:06:58.866 --> 02:07:01.067]  With rising unemployment and an economy
[02:07:04.628 --> 02:07:06.913]  Are you safe when you walk to your car?
[02:07:06.913 --> 02:07:09.038]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[02:07:09.038 --> 02:07:11.303]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge.
[02:07:16.403 --> 02:07:17.624]  We're good to go.
[02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:45.596]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:45.596 --> 02:07:46.857]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:20.771 --> 02:08:25.235]  Okay, we just started simulcasting live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:25.235 --> 02:08:27.656]  I had Justin, who's in Mexico City.
[02:08:27.656 --> 02:08:28.637]  We've called him there.
[02:08:28.637 --> 02:08:32.220]  He contacted our office, but we wanted to double-check that he was in Mexico City.
[02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:34.842]  We've had a lot of calls from Mexico City saying the same thing.
[02:08:34.842 --> 02:08:36.944]  A lot more dead people than you're hearing.
[02:08:36.944 --> 02:08:39.406]  A lot more people sick than you're hearing.
[02:08:39.406 --> 02:08:43.789]  We had Dr. Tenpenny on, who was in Mexico, couldn't get a flight out in Monterrey.
[02:08:43.789 --> 02:08:44.650]  Had to get out by bus.
[02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:48.353]  They told him the police came to the hotel, told everybody to leave.
[02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:49.654]  She was bussed out of the country.
[02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:53.850]  She's now in San Antonio.
[02:08:53.850 --> 02:09:00.552]  Dr. Deagle, do you have any questions before I let this caller go?
[02:09:00.552 --> 02:09:10.235]  Do you have any questions dealing specifically with what he witnessed three days in a hospital?
[02:09:10.235 --> 02:09:15.176]  What Justin witnessed in that Mexico City hospital?
[02:09:15.176 --> 02:09:15.656]  Go ahead.
[02:09:15.656 --> 02:09:17.057]  Yeah, the first thing I would ask is...
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:24.884]  If their idea of quarantine is to stick all the inpatients together, it means maximum cross-contamination.
[02:09:24.884 --> 02:09:27.005]  It means pregnant women and others.
[02:09:27.005 --> 02:09:28.726]  So that's a stupid policy.
[02:09:28.726 --> 02:09:38.712]  The second thing is to hear doctors, quote, demanding vaccines when the doctors should know better that it takes six months to make a vaccine with egg membrane technology.
[02:09:38.712 --> 02:09:43.635]  So it shows me that the health professionals are talking about really are not informed.
[02:09:43.635 --> 02:09:45.836]  Secondly, vaccines don't protect anyway.
[02:09:45.836 --> 02:09:46.857]  All they do is create a titer.
[02:09:47.366 --> 02:09:49.047]  Which is an antibody against the virus.
[02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:54.251]  You have to actually have a true host defense system in order to protect the body.
[02:09:54.251 --> 02:09:57.753]  And that's why being healthy prevents primary infection.
[02:09:57.753 --> 02:09:59.314]  So, that's number one.
[02:09:59.314 --> 02:10:03.177]  The other that I've heard actually from other reports is that they don't have proper masks.
[02:10:03.177 --> 02:10:15.245]  And if they don't have a respiratory fit mask, like these bio suits that I've seen, actually, that the Homeland Security are going to wear with Scott Airpaks and filters, you have to have an antiviral mask that's actually going to have a respiratory fit.
[02:10:15.799 --> 02:10:20.440]  Like a NIOSH N100, or even better, a nanomask.
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:29.962]  If you don't have those, and you're working around these sick people, the very first casualties, and this happened with the SARS or coronavirus, these are a big virus.
[02:10:29.962 --> 02:10:30.962]  These are many times bigger.
[02:10:30.962 --> 02:10:33.683]  They're the largest virus, pretty well, that infects humans.
[02:10:33.683 --> 02:10:41.044]  The influenza virus is a very small virus, relatively, and the droplet masks that doctors wear are useless.
[02:10:41.044 --> 02:10:43.825]  So, the first thing that's going to happen if there's a true pandemic,
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:45.261]  We're good to go.
[02:11:01.192 --> 02:11:17.440]  Meanwhile, the Homeland Security is walking around like supermen in their respiration suits, taking care of, just like on 9-11, they were all out there wearing, FEMA was out there wearing respirators, telling firemen and police, the air is fine, the air is fine.
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:22.943]  They've got a Scott Airpack on while everybody else has got a particle mask.
[02:11:23.553 --> 02:11:27.516]  Is for a painter that doesn't even stop the smaller particles.
[02:11:27.516 --> 02:11:28.317]  Exactly.
[02:11:28.317 --> 02:11:33.841]  And that's why we have a disaster in the brew here.
[02:11:33.841 --> 02:11:38.265]  Both FEMA and all these other agencies want to increase maximum cross-contamination.
[02:11:38.265 --> 02:11:43.109]  But I'd like to know, not only in Mexico, but in the UK, what are they talking about vaccinating people?
[02:11:43.109 --> 02:11:48.633]  Why are they telling all foreigners get on planes and leave, which right in the middle of an outbreak will vector all that?
[02:11:48.633 --> 02:11:51.476]  They're making the borders more open during it.
[02:11:51.476 --> 02:11:51.756]  Right.
[02:11:51.756 --> 02:11:52.937]  The first thing I would do,
[02:11:53.484 --> 02:11:55.725]  I mean, I shut down all air travel.
[02:11:55.725 --> 02:12:03.027]  And I'd have everybody called multiple times a day, and I'd have them not only cultured, I'd have a culture swab of their throat.
[02:12:03.027 --> 02:12:13.670]  Not just a Z-stat flu test, which is a rapid test I had in my clinic in Denver to measure, because that will miss up to 15 to 20% of cases even in the peak of an infection.
[02:12:13.670 --> 02:12:15.970]  So, you can't use a temperature.
[02:12:15.970 --> 02:12:21.632]  For example, Japan has basically blocked anybody coming into the country that has a temperature, you know, over 104.
[02:12:23.075 --> 02:12:23.736]  That's useless.
[02:12:23.736 --> 02:12:24.536]  You can shed the virus.
[02:12:24.536 --> 02:12:25.537]  They may be in the incubation.
[02:12:25.537 --> 02:12:25.977]  Exactly.
[02:12:25.977 --> 02:12:26.738]  They're going to be in a form.
[02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:26.858]  Right.
[02:12:26.858 --> 02:12:28.639]  They could be shedding virus all over the place.
[02:12:28.639 --> 02:12:30.521]  It's totally useless.
[02:12:30.521 --> 02:12:35.604]  Same way they tried to use thermal scanners in the Toronto Airport and other places when they had a major outbreak.
[02:12:35.604 --> 02:12:37.406]  It was useless.
[02:12:37.406 --> 02:12:37.726]  Stop.
[02:12:37.726 --> 02:12:42.390]  I want to go back to our caller in Mexico City so he can finish up any comments.
[02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:43.170]  We can let him go.
[02:12:43.170 --> 02:12:46.773]  Do you have any questions of Justin in Mexico City?
[02:12:46.773 --> 02:12:47.634]  Yeah.
[02:12:47.634 --> 02:12:49.795]  I'd like to know what kind of news reports are there?
[02:12:49.795 --> 02:12:50.456]  Is there a blackout?
[02:12:51.274 --> 02:12:52.455]  How many people are really sick?
[02:12:52.455 --> 02:12:54.276]  What's the ratio of deaths?
[02:12:54.276 --> 02:12:58.899]  See, I guess that there's at least two substrains and there may be emerging other ones.
[02:12:58.899 --> 02:13:05.843]  And in the steamship era, we would have new strains emerge every so many months because it took so long to travel.
[02:13:05.843 --> 02:13:13.628]  Now that people can fly around the world, we could have new substrains emerge, not just here, but in Europe or elsewhere, where people are taking this new strain.
[02:13:13.628 --> 02:13:16.629]  They could emerge from Eastern Europe or China or anywhere now.
[02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:19.271]  And once these get embedded into the population, I'd like to know
[02:13:20.112 --> 02:13:21.353]  What's the real death rate?
[02:13:21.353 --> 02:13:22.713]  Are they getting any real reports?
[02:13:22.713 --> 02:13:23.994]  Okay, well let's ask him that question.
[02:13:23.994 --> 02:13:29.276]  I mean, you were saying that the doctor said in that hospital you were in alone and you were out there for a day.
[02:13:29.276 --> 02:13:31.577]  20 dead people.
[02:13:31.577 --> 02:13:32.798]  Right.
[02:13:32.798 --> 02:13:38.400]  As far as I know, they only have a few facilities where they can actually test whether that's the virus or not.
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.921]  So it's very likely that people can die.
[02:13:40.921 --> 02:13:42.742]  Well, it's not flu season.
[02:13:42.742 --> 02:13:48.765]  If it's an influenza A virus, which you can do a test in 10 minutes, it's this recombinant lab virus.
[02:13:49.791 --> 02:13:50.772]  Unless proven otherwise.
[02:13:50.772 --> 02:13:55.034]  I mean, it's like if you hear the hoof beats, it's probably horses and not zebras.
[02:13:55.034 --> 02:14:04.398]  So, if there's 20 deaths from an acute respiratory illness, you know that this is almost certainly this viral bioweapon that's been released.
[02:14:04.398 --> 02:14:14.744]  And if they can even just do a rapid test, which any doctor's office anywhere can do, for influenza A, they can confirm, oh, you've got this virus.
[02:14:14.744 --> 02:14:16.564]  They almost certainly, this is the bug.
[02:14:16.564 --> 02:14:17.285]  And if they have 20 deaths,
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.161]  How many, what's the case fatality rate?
[02:14:20.161 --> 02:14:21.542]  See, I want to know that.
[02:14:21.542 --> 02:14:22.422]  And this is the problem.
[02:14:22.422 --> 02:14:23.763]  We don't see the genetic clades.
[02:14:23.763 --> 02:14:25.964]  They should already have that report out.
[02:14:25.964 --> 02:14:27.485]  Which gene groups are they?
[02:14:27.485 --> 02:14:31.527]  Are they reporting it to not only the public, but also other scientists?
[02:14:31.527 --> 02:14:39.372]  And now we have all these companies... Yeah, they should be putting out the sequence publicly, or at least the makeup, so that all these independent research firms can go to work looking at it.
[02:14:39.372 --> 02:14:42.854]  But they're being a little bit secretive about the makeup of this virus.
[02:14:42.854 --> 02:14:47.136]  You could, in a cellular culture, if you thought vaccines would work, which I know they don't,
[02:14:47.642 --> 02:14:47.902]  You can't.
[02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:09.126]  Like trying to shoot a bullet at a target six months after the target's already moved and gone into another state.
[02:15:09.126 --> 02:15:10.727]  It's ridiculous.
[02:15:10.727 --> 02:15:17.712]  Yeah, that'd be like if you wanted to kill Alex Jones, you went to the house I was born in that I haven't lived in in 30 years and blew it up.
[02:15:17.712 --> 02:15:19.474]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:19.474 --> 02:15:20.394]  It's insanity.
[02:15:20.394 --> 02:15:28.000]  And for them to say, these doctors that supposedly demand vaccines or they're going to give something, first off, there is no antiviral drug.
[02:15:28.479 --> 02:15:29.440]  They can stop this.
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:32.141]  And the ones that they would use are so toxic, for example.
[02:15:32.141 --> 02:15:34.643]  Well, Dr. Diegel, medical doctor, I've got a question for you.
[02:15:34.643 --> 02:15:39.365]  You've been following this for a long time and really obsessing over the viral flu and saying it was coming or something like that.
[02:15:39.365 --> 02:15:42.007]  Well, I know it's coming because they told me they were building it.
[02:15:42.007 --> 02:15:42.467]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:42.467 --> 02:15:44.288]  Sure, sure.
[02:15:44.288 --> 02:15:45.869]  Well, they admit they've built it.
[02:15:45.869 --> 02:15:47.870]  It's CDC admits they've done it.
[02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:49.291]  But the issue here is...
[02:15:52.182 --> 02:15:59.674]  We know viruses as they go through human bodies and animal bodies, they are always changing, mutating, like bacteria or anything else.
[02:15:59.674 --> 02:16:02.599]  Or the genetics of humans as we procreate.
[02:16:02.599 --> 02:16:03.781]  That's what we do here.
[02:16:07.719 --> 02:16:08.840]  How does this generally work?
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:12.163]  I see different schools of thought, different virologists, different doctors.
[02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:15.405]  Is it more rare for a virus to mutate into something harmless?
[02:16:15.405 --> 02:16:18.968]  Or is it more common for it to mutate into something bad?
[02:16:18.968 --> 02:16:36.582]  Or is it the characteristics of this virus, being this transgenetic mutagen, this cross-species of virus, with animal, pig, and bird, and then it didn't come from the East, as all flus do, it originates in Mexico, outside the flu season.
[02:16:37.443 --> 02:16:38.884]  You've had all this together, it's amazing.
[02:16:38.884 --> 02:16:42.386]  Well, someone you need to probably interview is Dr. Henry L. Nyman.
[02:16:42.386 --> 02:16:49.371]  Dr. Nyman probably is head of recombinomics in Pittsburgh, is a top virologist in the recombination.
[02:16:49.371 --> 02:16:51.852]  I believe that he is smack on.
[02:16:51.852 --> 02:16:56.395]  99% of the changes in any virus, whether it's flu or any other virus, is recombination.
[02:16:56.395 --> 02:17:00.818]  Not reassortment, not switching genes like shuffling cards, and not mutation.
[02:17:00.818 --> 02:17:05.761]  Mutation is very rare, it occurs when it's radiated or there's incredible amounts of toxic material around like
[02:17:06.345 --> 02:17:09.306]  Radioisotopes and toxic halides.
[02:17:09.306 --> 02:17:14.387]  What happens with recombination is similar to what happens in human cells when we make a baby.
[02:17:14.387 --> 02:17:19.229]  Your genes come together and there's a thing called synapses where genes are swapped.
[02:17:19.229 --> 02:17:29.812]  And this virus, meaning it has from four different sources, human, avian, Asian, and swine, it means it's had synapses with viruses on three different continents.
[02:17:29.812 --> 02:17:30.892]  So it's a lab virus.
[02:17:31.377 --> 02:17:34.678]  The danger right now is that this lab virus is a bridge.
[02:17:34.678 --> 02:17:36.939]  It's a bridge because it attaches to human cells.
[02:17:36.939 --> 02:17:38.640]  It's got the binding domain.
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:57.687]  It may have one or more of the lethal genes, and it's going to acquire new genes, either when it moves through territory like China or Eastern Europe, where we know that the virus is endemic, H5N1, or North America, where there's millions of birds dying, and British Columbia, Washington State, and Oregon, and California, and elsewhere in the U.S., you can pretty well find the
[02:17:58.408 --> 02:17:58.769]  I don't
[02:18:18.093 --> 02:18:29.479]  Highly airborne, to be mixed with a perfect spectrum of standard human acquirable flu viruses, mixed in the major vats.
[02:18:29.479 --> 02:18:35.462]  Thank God a subsidiary contractor tested it on ferrets, killed them deader than a hammer, and they found out this had happened.
[02:18:35.462 --> 02:18:37.964]  Then everything got shut down and quieted.
[02:18:37.964 --> 02:18:41.866]  Then we learned there were all these secret tests with people homeless being given it, being killed.
[02:18:42.826 --> 02:18:49.150]  Uh, and then Baxter, out of hundreds of big companies, has chosen to make the World Health Organization vaccine.
[02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:51.111]  I mean, this is really starting to get serious.
[02:18:51.111 --> 02:18:55.054]  It's really evil, and there's actually six companies, um, that are doing the vaccine.
[02:18:55.054 --> 02:18:56.215]  I tried contact with three.
[02:18:56.215 --> 02:19:11.464]  We not only had contact with Pfizer Pharmaceutical, which is another evil company, and I had, uh, November 2007 documents sent to me by a whistleblower in New Jersey in a health park there, which is, believe it or not, in a mall, uh, that was playing around with H1N1, which is resurrected.
[02:19:12.071 --> 02:19:12.352]  I'm good.
[02:19:23.177 --> 02:19:23.297]  Yeah.
[02:19:43.001 --> 02:19:49.345]  These creatures that might have 20 different animals in them, plants, insects, pull up a human-mouse hybrid.
[02:19:49.345 --> 02:19:51.246]  Let's show folks that.
[02:19:51.246 --> 02:19:56.469]  That's how they help make up a mousepox that has a 90% kill rate in Homo sapiens sapien.
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:08.104]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[02:20:08.104 --> 02:20:09.525]  Garden in a can!
[02:20:09.525 --> 02:20:13.666]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds.
[02:20:13.666 --> 02:20:15.687]  Garden in a can is ready when you are.
[02:20:15.687 --> 02:20:17.968]  Plant them now or store them for when you really need them.
[02:20:18.448 --> 02:20:28.139]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection.
[02:20:28.139 --> 02:20:29.540]  Garden in a can.
[02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:30.762]  It's that simple.
[02:20:30.762 --> 02:20:31.462]  Fresh.
[02:20:31.462 --> 02:20:32.323]  Healthy.
[02:20:32.323 --> 02:20:33.164]  Easy.
[02:20:33.164 --> 02:20:37.489]  Only $69.95 for over a half acre of safe fresh vegetables.
[02:20:37.489 --> 02:20:38.390]  Ready when you are.

[02:20:49.236 --> 02:20:51.277]  In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[02:21:00.307 --> 02:21:02.950]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:10.519]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:21:10.519 --> 02:21:16.686]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:17.106 --> 02:21:19.068]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:19.068 --> 02:21:21.570]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:21.570 --> 02:21:33.158]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:21:33.158 --> 02:21:34.840]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:36.701]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:21:36.701 --> 02:21:42.926]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:44.533 --> 02:22:00.896]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:22:00.896 --> 02:22:06.797]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:22:06.797 --> 02:22:07.897]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:22:07.897 --> 02:22:11.898]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:12.598 --> 02:22:25.944]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:25.944 --> 02:22:32.007]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:32.007 --> 02:22:37.910]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:23:47.715 --> 02:23:49.017]  Be a part of the revolution today!
[02:24:02.932 --> 02:24:04.933]  All right, I want to thank Justin in Mexico City.
[02:24:04.933 --> 02:24:09.434]  We'll stay in contact with him day to day as our contact there with what's happening.
[02:24:09.434 --> 02:24:10.394]  We'll pray for you, Justin.
[02:24:10.394 --> 02:24:17.137]  We appreciate you, and congratulations on your newborn daughter, but not as somebody from Mexico City, but somebody that was in a hospital.
[02:24:17.137 --> 02:24:19.518]  We'll take more calls for Dr. Deagle.
[02:24:19.518 --> 02:24:26.340]  Doc, time will tell with all of this as it unfolds, but there is no doubt
[02:24:27.401 --> 02:24:39.757]  That the globalists have engineered past plagues, that bioweapons have been used by governments to wage siege against populations since 1500 BC.
[02:24:39.757 --> 02:24:42.681]  And I've got the historical text here I want to go over coming up in the next segment.
[02:24:45.447 --> 02:25:04.130]  And we know they stand to gain from this, and I've been saying the last few months, there's no way they can get their agenda through politically raping the people, financially raping the people, unless they stage crises and then compose as saviors and make people so worried about their very lives that they will accept the transition to open world government, which is now happening.
[02:25:06.428 --> 02:25:08.028]  And that's clearly going on right now.
[02:25:08.028 --> 02:25:12.230]  So whether this is real or hyped, they are using it.
[02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:16.351]  People aren't talking about Obama being in for torture or leaving the troops in Iraq that was coming to a head.
[02:25:16.351 --> 02:25:19.692]  They're not talking about the $12.8 trillion that's been stolen by the banks.
[02:25:19.692 --> 02:25:22.353]  Mexico isn't on the verge of revolution anymore.
[02:25:22.353 --> 02:25:26.414]  This is just a godsend for the New World Order and then you have all these drills and all these preparations.
[02:25:29.211 --> 02:25:33.672]  In a crescendo leading up into March and April and now all this happening.
[02:25:33.672 --> 02:25:38.013]  I mean you put it all together and just the evidence just stacks and stacks.
[02:25:38.013 --> 02:25:41.613]  And then we know they're lying about the real number of deaths and illnesses.
[02:25:41.613 --> 02:25:44.974]  Saying everything's fine but then acting scared to death.
[02:25:44.974 --> 02:25:48.555]  This is just really wild.
[02:25:48.555 --> 02:25:56.416]  Let me read a letter actually that's in a news report from Mexico by a respiratory specialist published literally two days ago.
[02:25:57.402 --> 02:26:04.586]  Dr. Antonio Chavez, a doctor working in Mexico City, and I'm going to quote... Yeah, that's BBC, that's BBC, go ahead.
[02:26:04.586 --> 02:26:09.769]  I'm a specialist doctor in respiratory diseases and intensive care at the Mexican National Institute of Health.
[02:26:09.769 --> 02:26:12.751]  There's a severe emergency over the swine flu here.
[02:26:12.751 --> 02:26:16.493]  More and more patients are being admitted to the intensive care unit.
[02:26:16.493 --> 02:26:22.696]  Despite the heroic efforts of all the staff, doctors, nurses, specialists, etc., patients continue to inevitably die.
[02:26:23.308 --> 02:26:29.470]  The truth is that antiviral treatments and vaccines are not expected to have any effect, even at high doses.
[02:26:29.470 --> 02:26:32.051]  It is a great fear among the staff.
[02:26:32.051 --> 02:26:36.292]  The infection risk is very high among doctors and health staff.
[02:26:36.292 --> 02:26:40.373]  There is a sense of chaos in other hospitals and we do not know what to do.
[02:26:40.373 --> 02:26:44.734]  Staff are starting to leave and many are opting to retire or apply for holidays.
[02:26:44.734 --> 02:26:50.296]  The truth is that mortality is even higher than what has been reported by the authorities, at least in the hospital where I work.
[02:26:50.919 --> 02:26:56.084]  It is killing three to four patients daily and has been going on for more than three weeks.
[02:26:56.084 --> 02:26:57.926]  This was reported on the 26th.
[02:26:57.926 --> 02:27:02.890]  And it's now confirmed that the Mexican government, AP Reports, knew about this March 18th.
[02:27:02.890 --> 02:27:03.411]  Go ahead.
[02:27:03.411 --> 02:27:04.071]  Right.
[02:27:04.071 --> 02:27:06.554]  It is a shame and there is great fear here.
[02:27:06.554 --> 02:27:14.081]  Increasing younger patients age 20 to 30 years are dying before our helpless eyes and there is great sadness among health professionals here.
[02:27:14.081 --> 02:27:15.162]  This is from Alvaro
[02:27:15.683 --> 02:27:16.143]  Ricardo
[02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:32.431]  We'll come to San Diego.
[02:27:32.431 --> 02:27:32.991]  We'll come to Texas.
[02:27:32.991 --> 02:27:33.851]  Okay, well here's the issue then.
[02:27:33.851 --> 02:27:36.913]  Are we, okay, you're saying it's going to come to Texas and it's going to come to California?
[02:27:36.913 --> 02:27:37.693]  Oh yeah, it's coming real quick.
[02:27:37.693 --> 02:27:42.015]  What I'm saying is, what is going to happen, I mean, so we're going to find out soon though.
[02:27:42.015 --> 02:27:45.757]  If it's only Mexicans dying, then we know this is race specific.
[02:27:45.757 --> 02:27:49.278]  What if it starts, I mean, killing people?
[02:27:49.278 --> 02:27:51.019]  Then we know we're in deep trouble.
[02:27:51.019 --> 02:27:51.740]  Oh yeah.
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:57.082]  In this capital of my state, Oaxaca, there is a hospital closed because of a death related to the porcine influenza.
[02:27:57.622 --> 02:28:00.444]  In the papers, they recognize only two people dead for that cause.
[02:28:00.444 --> 02:28:04.668]  My friends working in the hospitals or related fields say that the situation is really bad.
[02:28:04.668 --> 02:28:10.552]  They are now talking about 19 people dead in Oaxaca, including a doctor and a nurse.
[02:28:10.552 --> 02:28:14.675]  They say that they got shots, but they were told not to talk about the real situation.
[02:28:14.675 --> 02:28:15.916]  Our authorities say nothing.
[02:28:15.916 --> 02:28:23.883]  Well, did you hear the Mexico City fellow saying 21 people died in the hospital he was in?
[02:28:23.883 --> 02:28:25.584]  Oh yeah, I'm sure the numbers are far worse.
[02:28:25.584 --> 02:28:26.945]  Now, here's the real problem.
[02:28:27.341 --> 02:28:39.434]  If we have a high pathogenic flu, we don't know how many of these lethal genes, and if we had the gene clades, if they were published, we'd say, okay, it's acquired the PB2 gene, it's, let's say, got the polybasic amino acid in the H gene so it can grow in the brains.
[02:28:39.434 --> 02:28:41.476]  Now, here's how sneaky this virus is.
[02:28:41.991 --> 02:28:45.052]  This virus can incubate in your body and they've already known this.
[02:28:45.052 --> 02:28:48.454]  Homeland Security knows it can grow 8-10 days and you could be shedding virus.
[02:28:48.454 --> 02:28:51.535]  You don't have a temperature, you don't have a cough, you don't have anything.
[02:28:51.535 --> 02:28:54.956]  Yeah, well it takes a while to get this long incubation which is really bad.
[02:28:54.956 --> 02:28:57.217]  And then people are sick for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[02:28:57.217 --> 02:28:58.118]  Speak to that.
[02:28:58.118 --> 02:29:08.322]  Yeah, and not only are they sick, but the people that recovered by the way from the 1918 flu, they developed frozen man syndrome which is caused by damage to the tectum of their midbrain.
[02:29:08.697 --> 02:29:14.283]  They developed Parkinson's disease and they developed a very aggressive form of dementia years or decades later.
[02:29:14.283 --> 02:29:19.888]  I took care of them in the 1970s that developed these syndromes after surviving the 1918 swine flu pandemic.
[02:29:22.312 --> 02:29:31.459]  All right, let's blitz through phone calls on the other side in our final segment with Dr. Deagle, MD, and we're going to go directly to your calls.
[02:29:31.459 --> 02:29:35.322]  Tom, Chris, Tony, Mark, Amber, and others.
[02:29:35.322 --> 02:29:35.883]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:29:35.883 --> 02:29:37.824]  Phone blitz coming up.
[02:29:37.824 --> 02:29:39.546]  I'll recap all the top stories.
[02:29:39.546 --> 02:29:43.449]  We are pretty much exclusively covering this flu situation, because we have to.
[02:29:43.449 --> 02:29:47.792]  Meanwhile, the globalists are stealing us all blind, and that's what they plan.
[02:29:47.792 --> 02:29:49.194]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.194 --> 02:29:50.695]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.690 --> 02:29:58.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.436 --> 02:30:00.338]  You are a rebel, admit it.
[02:30:00.338 --> 02:30:03.320]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.703]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[02:30:05.703 --> 02:30:09.646]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[02:30:09.646 --> 02:30:13.870]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot, and you can count your real friends on one hand.
[02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:15.130]  Well join the club.
[02:30:15.130 --> 02:30:21.332]  Einstein failed math, quit school, and his rebel ideas led to some of the world's most amazing discoveries.
[02:30:21.332 --> 02:30:25.993]  Edison rebelled against the dark, failed over a thousand times, then invented the light bulb.
[02:30:25.993 --> 02:30:30.754]  George Washington rebelled against an entire country and led the creation of a new one.
[02:30:30.754 --> 02:30:33.994]  Now Alex Jones is working to save that very country.
[02:30:33.994 --> 02:30:35.535]  So go ahead, be a rebel.
[02:30:35.535 --> 02:30:38.355]  Put in a food supply from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:38.355 --> 02:30:41.256]  Everyone will realize you were not a nutcase after all.
[02:30:46.169 --> 02:30:50.235]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:04.079 --> 02:31:09.961]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:09.961 --> 02:31:16.442]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:16.442 --> 02:31:18.443]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:18.443 --> 02:31:20.883]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:20.883 --> 02:31:31.786]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:34.073 --> 02:31:35.754]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:35.754 --> 02:31:37.596]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:37.596 --> 02:31:44.522]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:31:44.522 --> 02:31:52.789]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:52.789 --> 02:31:54.350]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:54.350 --> 02:31:55.531]  The people strike back.
[02:31:57.481 --> 02:31:58.942]  So you want to stop smoking?
[02:31:58.942 --> 02:32:00.223]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[02:32:00.223 --> 02:32:03.105]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[02:32:03.105 --> 02:32:07.088]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[02:32:07.088 --> 02:32:10.851]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[02:32:10.851 --> 02:32:12.873]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[02:32:12.873 --> 02:32:17.176]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[02:32:17.176 --> 02:32:20.098]  Smokefree is a complete, all-natural stop smoking system.
[02:32:20.098 --> 02:32:23.841]  And when you call today, they'll send you a 30-day supply of the program, absolutely free.
[02:32:24.241 --> 02:32:24.941]  We're good to go.
[02:32:40.427 --> 02:32:43.590]  Join the tens of thousands who have quit for life with Smoke Free.
[02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:44.131]  Call 1-800-426-6186 today!
[02:32:44.131 --> 02:32:44.411]  That's 1-800-426-6186.
[02:32:44.411 --> 02:32:45.892]  This is a limited time offer, so call 1-800-426-6186 now!
[02:33:27.324 --> 02:33:34.567]  Rusted chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[02:33:34.567 --> 02:33:40.910]  I walk a road, horizons change, the tournament's begun.
[02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:48.034]  The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sing.
[02:33:48.034 --> 02:33:54.957]  Three lullabies in an ancient tongue for the court of the crimson.
[02:34:04.924 --> 02:34:09.547]  We are here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:34:09.547 --> 02:34:09.887]  to 3 p.m.
[02:34:09.887 --> 02:34:12.528]  Central Standard Time.
[02:34:12.528 --> 02:34:14.089]  I come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:34:14.089 --> 02:34:30.339]  You know, it took many years of research to be able to admit to myself just how evil the globalists are and to face what their agenda is.
[02:34:34.321 --> 02:34:36.523]  Are we helpless?
[02:34:36.523 --> 02:34:39.465]  Or will we defend our families?
[02:34:39.465 --> 02:34:42.207]  And wrest control of the planet away from these madmen?
[02:34:42.207 --> 02:34:53.116]  Let's go ahead and go back to Dr. Deagle on your phone calls.
[02:34:53.116 --> 02:34:53.736]  Tom in Texas.
[02:34:58.160 --> 02:35:06.526]  You are on the air worldwide as we have continual coverage of the bird, swine flu, human flu, designer flu scare.
[02:35:06.526 --> 02:35:07.447]  Go ahead.
[02:35:07.447 --> 02:35:09.288]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:35:09.288 --> 02:35:26.640]  Dr. Tenpenny had mentioned the randomness of the spread of this NWO flu, and I've been looking at maps of where these reported cases and suspected cases come up, and it looks like it's following the interstate trucking routes.
[02:35:28.211 --> 02:35:30.538]  Popping up in like, you know, fueling depots.
[02:35:31.283 --> 02:35:32.724]  Or areas where you'd have to get fuel to travel?
[02:35:32.724 --> 02:35:33.504]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:35:33.504 --> 02:35:38.787]  We have 30 million illegal aliens in this country, most of them from Mexico, 80 plus percent.
[02:35:38.787 --> 02:35:42.609]  And there's millions of them going back and forth in any one week.
[02:35:42.609 --> 02:35:44.790]  That's one way to spread it.
[02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:47.692]  But you also have tourists all over the world, so that's one way.
[02:35:47.692 --> 02:35:52.454]  The issue, though, is it isn't killing people, but it hasn't really gone mega-viral yet.
[02:35:52.454 --> 02:35:54.355]  It hasn't gone pandemic and it's spread yet.
[02:35:54.355 --> 02:35:56.676]  I don't know if it'll be pandemic and it's mortality.
[02:35:59.878 --> 02:36:03.059]  Or it's morbidity, whatever the proper term is.
[02:36:03.059 --> 02:36:04.920]  And so, that's the big issue.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:18.406]  If it starts killing people in the West who have better medicine, who are healthier, but we've confirmed in Mexico it's killing the heads of museums, it's killing healthy people, it's killing people in coastal towns, it's killing farmers.
[02:36:18.406 --> 02:36:22.488]  Something stinks, and we're going to put this puzzle together in the end.
[02:36:22.488 --> 02:36:24.549]  Dr. Deagle, you want to comment on what Tom's saying?
[02:36:25.582 --> 02:36:31.005]  Yeah, it's actually an ancient ceremony by these Satanist globalists.
[02:36:31.005 --> 02:36:32.645]  It's called the Ceremony of the Phoenix.
[02:36:32.645 --> 02:36:35.407]  It goes back to ancient Sumer, Egypt, etc.
[02:36:35.407 --> 02:36:43.691]  And what they're doing is they're using a bird, just like Alfred Hitchcock, the bird's movie, his thriller, and they're using it as a vector to bring these genetics.
[02:36:43.691 --> 02:36:46.412]  And now they have a bridge virus they've released.
[02:36:46.412 --> 02:36:50.134]  And I don't believe that we're seeing the worst of it yet, by any means.
[02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:50.594]  I think that
[02:36:51.121 --> 02:36:51.401]  This is
[02:37:14.633 --> 02:37:15.413]  They're doing nothing.
[02:37:15.413 --> 02:37:20.336]  In fact, everything they're doing is going to make sure there's maximum spread of this cross-contamination.
[02:37:20.336 --> 02:37:31.302]  But Dr. Deagle, expanding on that, I mean, this could just be, I mean, we know there's 15,000, CDC says 36,000, but people I've talked to say they exaggerate the number of flu deaths every year.
[02:37:31.302 --> 02:37:32.323]  But I mean, let's just say it's 36,000.
[02:37:32.323 --> 02:37:35.625]  You got tens of thousands of deaths from flu every year in Mexico.
[02:37:36.545 --> 02:37:38.907]  And, uh, so a couple hundred people are dead.
[02:37:38.907 --> 02:37:42.270]  Let's say they're covering up, let's say a thousand, let's say a thousand are dead.
[02:37:42.270 --> 02:37:43.691]  Let's say five thousand are dead.
[02:37:43.691 --> 02:37:46.734]  Hypothetically, still, why all the fear mongering?
[02:37:46.734 --> 02:37:51.458]  That's what makes your heckles go up to see the Marshall Law Grid going in.
[02:37:51.458 --> 02:37:55.561]  Uh, you know, are they just using this hype to... Well, there's a couple of things.
[02:37:55.561 --> 02:38:02.467]  ...to hold on, to cover up the news cycle with all the other issues that they want to cover up, uh, the people rebelling in Mexico.
[02:38:03.317 --> 02:38:05.540]  Absolutely, they're using it as a tool.
[02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:07.061]  The first problem is the statistic.
[02:38:07.061 --> 02:38:15.510]  They don't actually have, if you were to say there's 36,000 deaths, the first thing they have to do is, number one, they have to prove that they had that virus in their system.
[02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:18.053]  So when they write it on their certificate, they don't have viral proof.
[02:38:18.053 --> 02:38:18.754]  That's number one.
[02:38:19.175 --> 02:38:22.776]  I was one of the reference clinics in Denver that actually did the viral test.
[02:38:22.776 --> 02:38:32.339]  A lot of times if they hospice some old lady, they say she died of flu or if it's a drug interaction or a bad surgery, they don't want to be sued for malpractice, so they say flu.
[02:38:32.339 --> 02:38:33.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:44.183]  And the other thing that happens is, and I know when I put somebody in the hospital, those who quote got the flu ended up on a respirator and needed all kinds of intensive care, they always had mycoplasma, okay?
[02:38:44.183 --> 02:38:48.805]  And by the way, mycoplasma is one of the components in the chemtrails, but I call them biotrails is a better term.
[02:38:49.594 --> 02:38:52.576]  So, they always had mycoplasma.
[02:38:52.576 --> 02:38:59.099]  If they had flu, which we could pick up on their blood tests, they always had mycoplasma if they ended up on a respirator or other problems.
[02:38:59.099 --> 02:39:04.862]  So, the statistic number one is exaggerated in terms of the number of deaths because there's many different organisms.
[02:39:04.862 --> 02:39:07.223]  There's hundreds of pathogens that can cause respiratory deaths.
[02:39:07.223 --> 02:39:11.625]  Yeah, this could also just be a cover for something that they've released separately.
[02:39:11.625 --> 02:39:11.825]  Right.
[02:39:11.825 --> 02:39:14.226]  You never know with their disinformation.
[02:39:14.226 --> 02:39:14.967]  Anything else, Tom?
[02:39:16.578 --> 02:39:23.023]  I just wanted to point it out that I saw the pattern, you know, where all the cases are reported, it looks like it's along the interstate.
[02:39:23.023 --> 02:39:27.046]  Yeah, it's up the Napa Superhighway, I-35, the Canamex.
[02:39:27.046 --> 02:39:27.887]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:39:27.887 --> 02:39:29.268]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:39:29.268 --> 02:39:31.089]  That makes sense.
[02:39:31.089 --> 02:39:32.851]  Let's talk to Chris in Wisconsin.
[02:39:32.851 --> 02:39:33.611]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:39:33.611 --> 02:39:34.632]  Go ahead.
[02:39:34.632 --> 02:39:42.819]  Hey, you know, I don't know if this is fear-mongering or not, but I'll tell you, there was a chilling article I read back in February, and it's a local Wisconsin company building 195
[02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:48.382]  Refrigerated morgue trucks for Navistar.
[02:39:48.382 --> 02:39:50.043]  That's a lot of bodies.
[02:39:50.043 --> 02:39:51.244]  No, no, listen.
[02:39:51.244 --> 02:39:52.164]  It's not a rumor.
[02:39:52.164 --> 02:39:54.966]  Glenn Beck comes out and says it doesn't exist.
[02:39:54.966 --> 02:40:03.971]  I have the mass grave folder here, and it's Rocky Mountain News, it's internal documents, Division of Cemetery, State of New York.
[02:40:03.971 --> 02:40:11.215]  You can call the phone numbers, it's up on InfoWars.com, and the article, Plans for Mass Graves Confirm Government Surveying Cemetery Readiness for Flu Outbreak.
[02:40:11.835 --> 02:40:13.898]  And I've been tracking this for years.
[02:40:13.898 --> 02:40:17.181]  It's all suddenly, the last two years, just exploded.
[02:40:17.181 --> 02:40:19.304]  And they're telling feds, hey, get ready, it's gonna happen.
[02:40:19.304 --> 02:40:21.106]  They're telling local police, get ready.
[02:40:21.106 --> 02:40:23.028]  I mean, how did they know?
[02:40:23.028 --> 02:40:31.478]  How did the, in 1996, how did the Air Force do a study saying there'd be a massive flu outbreak in 2009 that would kill 30 million people?
[02:40:32.699 --> 02:40:39.623]  I mean, folks, all I do is research this, and I'm telling you, there's a curveball in here.
[02:40:39.623 --> 02:40:41.283]  Something is going on.
[02:40:41.283 --> 02:40:50.008]  There's more than meets the eye to this, and we've got to remember the globalists are ready to do anything.
[02:40:50.008 --> 02:40:52.749]  Dr. Diegel, on the issue of mass graves.
[02:40:52.749 --> 02:40:54.250]  Yeah.
[02:40:54.250 --> 02:40:55.230]  In June of 2003,
[02:40:57.302 --> 02:40:57.823]  The U.S.
[02:40:57.823 --> 02:41:02.427]  government and the Department of Homeland Security received six million body banks.
[02:41:02.427 --> 02:41:05.229]  And these were not to be shipped to Iraq or Afghanistan.
[02:41:05.229 --> 02:41:06.690]  That was just the first shipment.
[02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:14.237]  They've been receiving shipments literally every couple of months in that order of magnitude, including these coffins that can put more than one body in.
[02:41:14.237 --> 02:41:24.246]  I have their documents and reports that they actually were planning on figuring where they could put the bodies, like in old coal or tin mines, below the water lines so it wouldn't affect the ground table.
[02:41:24.588 --> 02:41:28.489]  So they could literally drop the bodies in because they don't have the facilities to burn them all.
[02:41:28.489 --> 02:41:31.930]  So they want to stick them in body bags and put them below the water table.
[02:41:31.930 --> 02:41:34.491]  By the way, I have the Rocky Mountain News here.
[02:41:34.491 --> 02:41:39.572]  This is all admitted under what the CDC's announced in this Homeland Security emergency.
[02:41:39.572 --> 02:41:41.513]  That's all in the executive orders.
[02:41:41.513 --> 02:41:45.434]  This is not our opinion, but Glenn Beck will get up and say it doesn't exist.
[02:41:45.434 --> 02:41:45.834]  Yeah, I know.
[02:41:45.834 --> 02:41:46.615]  Isn't it ridiculous?
[02:41:46.615 --> 02:41:51.496]  And the fact is that we're not, by the way, this is a new term I'd like to use, Alex, and I'm sure that you'll like it.
[02:41:52.011 --> 02:41:52.472]  We're good to go.
[02:42:05.353 --> 02:42:05.753]  We're good.
[02:42:23.843 --> 02:42:28.907]  You know, this is not, this is not our opinion and people try to debunk my films.
[02:42:28.907 --> 02:42:30.248]  They do straw men.
[02:42:30.248 --> 02:42:39.535]  They say, oh, his film shows Bush's people and shows Kashkari and Alex is saying that guy works for Obama.
[02:42:39.535 --> 02:42:40.316]  No, we don't.
[02:42:40.316 --> 02:42:45.980]  We show that both groups work together and that it's bipartisan and they try to spin that.
[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:49.263]  I mean, they can't debunk anything.
[02:42:49.263 --> 02:42:50.764]  I mean, are they happy?
[02:42:50.764 --> 02:42:51.625]  I mean, I remember
[02:42:52.802 --> 02:42:57.066]  I remember, you know, this one guy we're calling who works at a car dealership from West Virginia.
[02:42:57.066 --> 02:43:06.294]  Two, three years ago, he told me I was a liar, the economy wasn't going to implode, the bankers weren't going to make a bank of the world, GM wasn't going to be in trouble, and now look at what's happening.
[02:43:06.294 --> 02:43:10.077]  I mean, you know, what does it take, folks, for you to realize we know what we're talking about?
[02:43:10.077 --> 02:43:14.982]  Anything else that you need to add there, Chris, in Wisconsin?
[02:43:14.982 --> 02:43:19.646]  No, just that they ordered these trucks in December and they've got to have them delivered by next month.
[02:43:20.310 --> 02:43:20.590]  Alex?
[02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:20.770]  Yes?
[02:43:20.770 --> 02:43:21.571]  How you doing?
[02:43:21.571 --> 02:43:23.752]  I don't know if you remember me, I called back in October
[02:43:49.398 --> 02:43:55.702]  Uh, with the Obama confrontation, and then I got on, uh, live TV, uh, confronting, uh, Charlie Gibson.
[02:43:55.702 --> 02:43:56.522]  You remember that?
[02:43:56.522 --> 02:43:57.723]  Yes.
[02:43:57.723 --> 02:43:58.463]  Okay, great.
[02:43:58.463 --> 02:44:02.185]  Well, uh, what I did this past Saturday is, you know the OAF?
[02:44:02.185 --> 02:44:04.686]  That's the Organizing for America, uh, right?
[02:44:04.686 --> 02:44:06.387]  It's based out of the White House.
[02:44:06.387 --> 02:44:12.931]  Yeah, the private thug group with billions of dollars publicly to go out and enforce things for them.
[02:44:13.823 --> 02:44:14.223]  Right.
[02:44:14.223 --> 02:44:20.908]  Well, I went there this Saturday to one of those meetings posing as wanting to be a community organizer, right?
[02:44:20.908 --> 02:44:23.250]  But what I did was, you know, I raised my hand.
[02:44:23.250 --> 02:44:25.872]  There's probably about 75-80 people there.
[02:44:25.872 --> 02:44:28.214]  So what I did is I raised my hand.
[02:44:28.214 --> 02:44:32.697]  I said, I prepared a half-page speech on community organization.
[02:44:32.697 --> 02:44:34.078]  Would you mind if I read this?
[02:44:34.078 --> 02:44:37.021]  So I went up there and I got in front of all these people, right?
[02:44:37.021 --> 02:44:41.404]  And the first half of the speech is just, you know, after eight years of
[02:44:41.897 --> 02:44:44.741]  War and economic hardship, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:44:44.741 --> 02:44:49.026]  As community organizers, we need to make sure that our country goes in the right direction.
[02:44:49.026 --> 02:44:56.456]  And then, and right then, was when I just said, you know, Obama has proposed a million-person national security force.
[02:44:57.089 --> 02:45:06.074]  Uh, talked about, you know, Rahm Emanuel, uh, in the 1825, uh, Universal Service, and was, and just, these people's faces were just, like, jaw-dropped.
[02:45:06.074 --> 02:45:08.916]  They had never heard of the proposal.
[02:45:08.916 --> 02:45:17.921]  And because you opened it up by attacking Bush, you ended the left-right membrane of control, and they were absolutely defenseless to the truth.
[02:45:17.921 --> 02:45:18.481]  Right.
[02:45:18.481 --> 02:45:24.405]  That's exactly what I, I presented it as, just imagine if Bush proposed this, you know,
[02:45:26.115 --> 02:45:27.215]  People would burn the city to the ground.
[02:45:27.215 --> 02:45:30.737]  And if you approach it like that, you can break their programming.
[02:45:30.737 --> 02:45:32.338]  That's what the Obama deception does.
[02:45:32.338 --> 02:45:35.080]  What did you do from that point on?
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:38.122]  Well, I read my speech, and then after that I elaborated.
[02:45:38.122 --> 02:45:40.503]  You know, I said, Obama's calling for a world order.
[02:45:40.503 --> 02:45:46.066]  Bush, Baby Bush, you know, Papa Bush, Bill Clinton, all of them are calling for a new world order.
[02:45:46.066 --> 02:45:51.850]  You know, Tony Blair, you know, I was naming all these people that have been calling for the new world order.
[02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:58.194]  Seriously, you know, these people's faces, I could tell that, you know, they could tell I was speaking from the heart.
[02:45:58.194 --> 02:46:00.535]  They could tell that this was factual.
[02:46:00.535 --> 02:46:04.798]  And I really hope that they went and researched this.
[02:46:04.798 --> 02:46:09.400]  No, you're very confident and you're focused and you've got the forces with you, as they say.
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:10.481]  You've got the spirit.
[02:46:10.481 --> 02:46:14.423]  And that's what it takes to get the job done.
[02:46:14.423 --> 02:46:18.325]  I'm surprised they didn't have a troll there, one of the minion organizers.
[02:46:18.325 --> 02:46:19.766]  Did they try to shut you down at that point?
[02:46:20.758 --> 02:46:30.042]  Yeah, they cut my mic, but as I was elaborating, they cut my mic, but I kept talking.
[02:46:30.042 --> 02:46:34.144]  I said, please Google Obama's draft.
[02:46:34.144 --> 02:46:36.145]  Google the Obama deception.
[02:46:36.145 --> 02:46:44.909]  It details how he's a front man for finance capital, a salesman, there to sell an agenda that Bush or McCain could never sell to the public.
[02:46:45.495 --> 02:46:51.786]  You know he's groomed and catapulted, groomed by the financial and intellectual elite.
[02:46:53.358 --> 02:47:00.821]  And listen, their whole agenda was failing.
[02:47:00.821 --> 02:47:10.646]  If they don't start a war, if they don't stage a bio-attack, that's how they get us to, even though we're in hardship, rally around the government, quote, come together under them.
[02:47:10.646 --> 02:47:19.370]  They need crises, and that is certainly, whether it's hyped or real, that's what this lab-made designer flu is all about.
[02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:20.710]  I salute you, good job.
[02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:22.671]  Dr. Diegel, again, I go back to that
[02:47:22.891 --> 02:47:29.075]  At that point, I didn't say a year ago they were going to release bird flu, I was saying the last two months.
[02:47:29.075 --> 02:47:41.923]  I said some type of flu, I see them preparing, I see that being set up, I see all these drills, the same pattern I saw before 9-11, I said get ready, brace for it, I believe they're about to play the bio card.
[02:47:44.424 --> 02:47:45.864]  Again, it's not that I'm even that smart.
[02:47:45.864 --> 02:47:48.065]  It's that I constantly study this.
[02:47:48.065 --> 02:47:49.445]  You're obsessed.
[02:47:49.445 --> 02:47:50.645]  That's why you know it.
[02:47:50.645 --> 02:47:51.245]  You read.
[02:47:51.245 --> 02:47:52.966]  You actually apply.
[02:47:52.966 --> 02:47:55.746]  You know, the reason is, I like Alan Sting's article a month and a half ago.
[02:47:55.746 --> 02:48:02.107]  He said, people that win, win because they're 100% committed or 110%.
[02:48:02.107 --> 02:48:05.748]  You win a war not because you have better weapons, because you're more committed people.
[02:48:05.748 --> 02:48:07.048]  It's like Gideon's army.
[02:48:07.048 --> 02:48:11.069]  He didn't want the one that would lap up the water like a dog to have their eyes above the water.
[02:48:11.542 --> 02:48:11.902]  We're good to go.
[02:48:39.209 --> 02:48:40.309]  That's right.
[02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:50.353]  Their official numbers are 80, but when you look at the new scientists graduating, they actually openly ridicule the old 80 percenters and say, no, we've got to kill everyone.
[02:48:50.353 --> 02:48:51.633]  We've got to kill ourselves.
[02:48:51.633 --> 02:48:53.714]  I mean, it's totally nihilistic.
[02:48:53.714 --> 02:48:54.634]  They're out of their minds.
[02:48:54.634 --> 02:48:58.816]  And then you see their white papers and their graduate papers from years ago.
[02:48:58.816 --> 02:49:03.777]  You Google their name and it's them at bioweapons labs in white coats.
[02:49:03.777 --> 02:49:06.858]  All the medical schools, all the universities are all teaching the same garbage.
[02:49:06.858 --> 02:49:08.059]  It's not just Dr. Pianka.
[02:49:08.539 --> 02:49:09.059]  It's everywhere.
[02:49:09.059 --> 02:49:11.119]  Let me ask you, when you went to medical school, were they teaching this?
[02:49:11.119 --> 02:49:12.800]  Because my dad at UT... Sure they were.
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:14.880]  Yeah, we were teaching him, we gotta kill everybody.
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:31.263]  Oh yeah, I was, listen, I was one of the charter members of Greenpeace, and I got real angry back in the 70s, because I was doing oceanography and bacteriology before I went into medicine, and I got real mad when they started playing these games with seal pups and doing other garbage, and it was all, and they hijacked it, completely took it over.
[02:49:31.263 --> 02:49:34.984]  The Rothschilds and the globalists took over the environmental movement.
[02:49:34.984 --> 02:49:36.364]  It's now run by idiots like
[02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:39.613]  Like Mr. I call him Igor.
[02:49:39.613 --> 02:49:41.355]  Al Gore is a liar.
[02:49:41.355 --> 02:49:47.021]  This guy with his carbon dioxide and the new world currency I call it the carbon debt units.
[02:49:47.021 --> 02:49:55.650]  It's an anti-life currency where the world currency that's coming that they've actually agreed upon is a anti-life currency based on debt against carbon.
[02:49:55.650 --> 02:49:57.272]  That means us, carbon dioxide.
[02:49:57.805 --> 02:50:00.508]  It is literally opening the bottomless pit.
[02:50:00.508 --> 02:50:02.750]  Yeah, we are carbon-based life forms.
[02:50:02.750 --> 02:50:05.753]  Yeah, this evil is so palpable.
[02:50:05.753 --> 02:50:06.974]  And then I have people who want to argue.
[02:50:06.974 --> 02:50:10.758]  I said, look, people may not like my personality, your personality.
[02:50:10.758 --> 02:50:11.639]  We're just committed.
[02:50:11.639 --> 02:50:16.423]  We're like a wild, we're like the army there of William Wallace.
[02:50:16.423 --> 02:50:20.527]  And I've got relatives that are William, you know, the blood of William Wallace flows in my veins.
[02:50:20.527 --> 02:50:21.188]  Let's put it that way.
[02:50:21.618 --> 02:50:23.820]  And I'm not going to back off.
[02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:28.163]  I know we have to realize just what's on the table here.
[02:50:28.163 --> 02:50:30.404]  This is the final deal.
[02:50:30.404 --> 02:50:34.567]  And whether it's this wave or this fall or next year, they're coming.
[02:50:34.567 --> 02:50:35.068]  They're coming now.
[02:50:35.068 --> 02:50:35.928]  Absolutely.
[02:50:35.928 --> 02:50:36.449]  They're coming.
[02:50:37.069 --> 02:50:40.310]  This bioweapon attack is the tip of the spear for the New World Order, and so is Obama.
[02:50:40.310 --> 02:50:41.190]  They're closer.
[02:50:41.190 --> 02:50:42.571]  Neutromedicalreport.com.
[02:50:42.571 --> 02:50:44.491]  Neutromedical.com.
[02:50:44.491 --> 02:50:46.172]  Dr. Deagle, we'll talk to you again later in the week.
[02:50:46.172 --> 02:50:47.112]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:47.112 --> 02:50:50.933]  More of your calls straight ahead, and then we're going to have Dr. Rebecca Carley on with us as well.
[02:50:50.933 --> 02:50:53.514]  Thank you, Dr. Deagle, for all your insightful information.
[02:50:53.514 --> 02:50:54.534]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:54.534 --> 02:50:55.194]  Thank you so much.
[02:50:55.194 --> 02:50:55.755]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:57.492 --> 02:51:06.197]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[02:51:57.455 --> 02:52:03.257]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:03.257 --> 02:52:10.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:10.862 --> 02:52:17.389]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:17.389 --> 02:52:19.411]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:19.411 --> 02:52:21.914]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:21.914 --> 02:52:32.886]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:33.473 --> 02:52:35.154]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:35.154 --> 02:52:37.015]  It's about a one world government.
[02:52:37.015 --> 02:52:43.920]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:52.185 --> 02:52:53.766]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:53.766 --> 02:52:54.947]  The people strike back.
[02:52:56.815 --> 02:52:58.496]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:52:58.496 --> 02:53:00.238]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:53:00.238 --> 02:53:02.940]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:08.064]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:53:08.064 --> 02:53:11.267]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:53:11.267 --> 02:53:14.750]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:27.703]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:53:27.703 --> 02:53:29.724]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:53:29.724 --> 02:53:31.444]  I use one every day.
[02:53:31.444 --> 02:53:33.885]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:53:34.085 --> 02:53:34.865]  We're good to go.
[02:55:03.039 --> 02:55:05.901]  I got some really bad news for folks.
[02:55:05.901 --> 02:55:09.143]  And I've generally found these guys to be pretty accurate.
[02:55:09.143 --> 02:55:12.326]  It's their world service out of Iran.
[02:55:12.326 --> 02:55:13.546]  But Google this for me in there.
[02:55:13.546 --> 02:55:15.988]  I want to get it from another source.
[02:55:15.988 --> 02:55:18.830]  Who to raise swine flu alert to level 5.
[02:55:21.874 --> 02:55:29.978]  Now, Level 4 is total police state crackdown if they want to, shutting down schools, things like that.
[02:55:29.978 --> 02:55:31.719]  Level 5 is forced inoculations.
[02:55:31.719 --> 02:55:36.422]  We read from Level 5 UN World Health Organization documents earlier.
[02:55:36.422 --> 02:55:43.966]  Considering a rapidly increasing number of confirmed swine flu cases, and again, they keep calling it swine flu, it's a designer virus, clearly.
[02:55:43.966 --> 02:55:49.349]  The World Health Organization, it's a transgenetic virus, I mean, they're all transgenic, but it's three different species.
[02:55:50.336 --> 02:55:55.158]  WHO officials have decided to raise the pandemic alert level to Phase 5.
[02:55:55.158 --> 02:56:01.361]  Swine influenza, swine flu, caused by Taipei influenza, regularly leads to influenza outbreaks among pigs.
[02:56:01.361 --> 02:56:03.262]  The virus does not normally infect humans.
[02:56:03.262 --> 02:56:10.905]  Confirmed sufferers in the United States and Mexico, however, are believed to have spread the disease to their families and others in contact.
[02:56:10.905 --> 02:56:11.325]  Google it.
[02:56:11.325 --> 02:56:13.646]  Find me something else other than that.
[02:56:13.646 --> 02:56:15.907]  Do World Health Organization WHO Level 5.
[02:56:15.907 --> 02:56:17.208]  I'm going to get that from the UN.
[02:56:18.328 --> 02:56:30.755]  The alert level was increased to level 4 on Monday and the World Health Organization officials now said they will be forced to declare a phase 5 alert soon.
[02:56:30.755 --> 02:56:34.097]  And this is supposedly a UN news briefing.
[02:56:34.097 --> 02:56:36.339]  They're having a CDC one coming up in a few minutes.
[02:56:37.689 --> 02:56:41.553]  We're still awaiting for a final confirmation of the U.S.
[02:56:41.553 --> 02:56:47.699]  authorities, but it appears that there's a number of cases in New York which appear to be human-to-human transmission.
[02:56:47.699 --> 02:56:49.361]  Well, we've known that for days.
[02:56:49.361 --> 02:56:51.142]  World Health Organization spokesman Gregory
[02:56:52.253 --> 02:56:54.274]  Hardell told a news briefing.
[02:56:54.274 --> 02:57:00.617]  The United Nations Agency also raises alert level to four on Monday as the virus was detected in several European countries.
[02:57:00.617 --> 02:57:04.599]  Mexican authorities say the new strain has killed 149 people.
[02:57:04.599 --> 02:57:05.120]  Are you kidding?
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:06.640]  It was 150-something yesterday.
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:08.081]  And that's a whitewash.
[02:57:08.081 --> 02:57:11.263]  Some 64 confirmed cases have been reported in the U.S.
[02:57:11.263 --> 02:57:12.983]  in five states.
[02:57:12.983 --> 02:57:15.725]  Uh, Texas and California first.
[02:57:15.725 --> 02:57:17.626]  Did you find under who level five?
[02:57:17.626 --> 02:57:20.567]  Anything else?
[02:57:20.567 --> 02:57:21.408]  Okay, BBC.
[02:57:26.786 --> 02:57:28.948]  Just try who level 5.
[02:57:28.948 --> 02:57:30.749]  Dumb that search down.
[02:57:30.749 --> 02:57:32.991]  Maybe that'll bring it up.
[02:57:32.991 --> 02:57:35.953]  But that is from Press TV.
[02:57:35.953 --> 02:57:37.674]  We'll look into that.
[02:57:37.674 --> 02:57:41.277]  I mean, if I saw that from AP, I'd try to get it from another source.
[02:57:41.277 --> 02:57:46.021]  I've never seen Press TV with any flat-out baloney, so we'll try to look into that.
[02:57:46.943 --> 02:57:48.624]  We're going to come back, take more calls.
[02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:50.226]  We've got Dr. Rebecca Carley coming up.
[02:57:50.226 --> 02:57:51.226]  Lots of calls there as well.
[02:57:51.226 --> 02:57:52.627]  But right now, let's go ahead and jam in.
[02:57:52.627 --> 02:57:53.628]  Amber in Canada.
[02:57:53.628 --> 02:57:55.650]  Amber, go ahead.
[02:57:55.650 --> 02:57:56.230]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:59.993]  This is... It's Amr, actually, without the B. In Ottawa?
[02:57:59.993 --> 02:58:01.014]  Amr, Amr, sure.
[02:58:01.014 --> 02:58:01.815]  The screen's a little bitty.
[02:58:01.815 --> 02:58:02.275]  It's over there.
[02:58:02.275 --> 02:58:02.956]  Go ahead.
[02:58:02.956 --> 02:58:03.276]  Right on.
[02:58:03.276 --> 02:58:04.176]  Thank you.
[02:58:04.176 --> 02:58:06.839]  Just three points I want to make here.
[02:58:06.839 --> 02:58:15.025]  We're having a screening tonight of Kevin Annette's Unrepentant and a screening of your movie Endgame tonight.
[02:58:15.592 --> 02:58:21.195]  At the Mayfair Theatre, 1074 Bank Street in Ottawa at 7pm.
[02:58:21.195 --> 02:58:25.658]  Just wanted to let all your Ottawa listeners know about that.
[02:58:25.658 --> 02:58:34.503]  Second thing is, I'm just reading the Ottawa Citizen here about the swine flu, the hybrid, whatever they're calling it there.
[02:58:34.503 --> 02:58:38.966]  Stay there, back in 70 seconds with Final Hour.
[02:58:38.966 --> 02:58:42.488]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:42.488 --> 02:58:44.309]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:47.435 --> 02:58:49.137]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:49.137 --> 02:58:53.883]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:53.883 --> 02:58:56.847]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:58:56.847 --> 02:58:59.891]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line, if you have your own bread.
[02:58:59.891 --> 02:59:05.739]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[02:59:05.959 --> 02:59:09.202]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:09.202 --> 02:59:16.187]  You know, efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:16.187 --> 02:59:19.470]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:19.470 --> 02:59:19.730]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:19.730 --> 02:59:21.351]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:24.614 --> 02:59:30.878]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, prescribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:30.878 --> 02:59:34.640]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:34.640 --> 02:59:36.181]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:36.181 --> 02:59:36.621]  Take action today.
[02:59:36.621 --> 02:59:38.442]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:50.123 --> 02:59:52.526]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:52.526 --> 02:59:55.229]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:14.629 --> 03:00:20.731]  All right, we've got medical doctor Rebecca Carley, different perspective, and Dr. M.D.
[03:00:20.731 --> 03:00:24.112]  Sherry Campanion, who was in Mexico yesterday.
[03:00:24.112 --> 03:00:24.312]  M.D.
[03:00:24.312 --> 03:00:26.113]  Dr. Bill Deagle joined us as well.
[03:00:26.113 --> 03:00:29.954]  Dr. Rebecca Carley and lots of your calls.
[03:00:29.954 --> 03:00:34.456]  And to recap, I've got some other news that isn't bird flu potential.
[03:00:35.857 --> 03:00:36.317]  ...pandemic.
[03:00:36.317 --> 03:00:37.418]  I keep calling it bird flu.
[03:00:37.418 --> 03:00:40.060]  It's more akin to that than swine flu.
[03:00:40.060 --> 03:00:41.741]  It's a designer virus, no doubt of that.
[03:00:41.741 --> 03:00:45.764]  In fact, I keep mentioning this, and I haven't done it the last three hours.
[03:00:45.764 --> 03:00:53.890]  Next segment, to introduce Dr. Rebecca Carnley, we're going to play a little CNN clip with a top general, retired, saying, we need to look at this being bred in a lab.
[03:00:53.890 --> 03:00:56.112]  That is coming up.
[03:00:56.112 --> 03:01:01.276]  But, Amer, in Canada, you had another point you were going to make about what's in the newspaper there in Canada.
[03:01:01.966 --> 03:01:13.015]  Alex, I'm just reading today's Ottawa Sun, sorry, Ottawa Citizen here, and it's saying that there's five suspected Ottowans being monitored, and they flew in from Mexico.
[03:01:13.015 --> 03:01:17.478]  So nothing really big yet here, but I just wanted to make that point.
[03:01:17.478 --> 03:01:26.965]  The third thing I wanted to ask, probably to one of the doctors there, is you mentioned oil over oregano yesterday, and colloidal silver, and a lot of great things.
[03:01:28.436 --> 03:01:40.122]  I've never experienced oil of oregano before, and I'm sure a lot of people haven't, or colloidal silver, and I'm just wondering what's the best method of administrating this stuff, and I'll gladly take my answer off the air.
[03:01:40.122 --> 03:01:41.043]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:01:41.043 --> 03:01:42.403]  We love you here in Ottawa.
[03:01:42.403 --> 03:01:43.224]  Alright, thank you, sir.
[03:01:43.224 --> 03:01:46.266]  I'm not going to practice medicine here on air.
[03:01:46.266 --> 03:01:53.229]  Now, I've had these medical doctors on, and I mean, I've been looking at this for years, and I especially have children who try to find out what to have in the cupboard.
[03:01:57.076 --> 03:01:59.358]  You know, I bring up elderberry, which is an antiviral.
[03:01:59.358 --> 03:02:06.623]  That can also, they say, trigger, with certain things, an autoimmune response, which is actually what kills healthy people.
[03:02:06.623 --> 03:02:08.524]  But, again, I'm not practicing medicine here.
[03:02:08.524 --> 03:02:11.407]  I'm just telling you what the doctors have said and what I do myself.
[03:02:11.407 --> 03:02:15.450]  Colloidal silver, the smallest nanoparticles you can get, are important.
[03:02:15.450 --> 03:02:19.753]  I wouldn't take it all the time, where you can build up the metal in your body and get a blue tinge to your skin, literally.
[03:02:20.473 --> 03:02:23.977]  Uh, but you know, taking it when you're sick, medical doctors say is good.
[03:02:23.977 --> 03:02:25.379]  Smaller the particle, the better.
[03:02:25.379 --> 03:02:28.042]  Very powerful antibiotic and antiviral.
[03:02:28.042 --> 03:02:30.905]  Oil of oregano, just full of vitamin A and others.
[03:02:34.403 --> 03:02:35.564]  Let me put one drop in water.
[03:02:35.564 --> 03:02:37.285]  It's like super strong in your drink.
[03:02:37.285 --> 03:02:38.767]  It's kind of like peppers, though.
[03:02:38.767 --> 03:02:45.132]  You get used to it once you've... I mean, I can, like, drink Tabasco now, and it doesn't... well, just like oil of oregano, I can take quite a bit of it.
[03:02:45.132 --> 03:02:47.394]  Very powerful.
[03:02:47.394 --> 03:02:53.699]  There's also a lot of raw garlic, or lots of it cooked, roasted garlic, you know, put in the oven with a little bit of oil under it.
[03:02:54.399 --> 03:02:55.200]  It's like butter.
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:56.400]  I don't put butter on bread, folks.
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:02:58.042]  I probably got horrible breath, but whatever.
[03:02:58.042 --> 03:03:00.203]  Take that garlic out, put it on the bread.
[03:03:00.203 --> 03:03:01.264]  It's so good.
[03:03:01.264 --> 03:03:02.284]  That's really good for you.
[03:03:02.284 --> 03:03:05.846]  Lots of water, lots of sleep, and just loving God and being happy.
[03:03:05.846 --> 03:03:07.948]  But if it really starts breaking out and killing people in the U.S.
[03:03:07.948 --> 03:03:10.369]  and other places, don't put your kids in school.
[03:03:10.369 --> 03:03:12.491]  You gotta stay home.
[03:03:13.211 --> 03:03:14.872]  Hello Alex, this is Don in Pennsylvania.
[03:03:14.872 --> 03:03:18.315]  I just stumbled across a little news item I didn't hear you mention in the last two days.
[03:03:39.684 --> 03:03:42.125]  It's on Forbes.com.
[03:03:42.125 --> 03:03:46.586]  It's a cross-post from Reuters dated 48 hours ago.
[03:03:46.586 --> 03:03:56.749]  And that's the head of Homeland Security saying that, let me guess, that's her saying, hey, even if this flu doesn't kill you, the next one will.
[03:03:56.749 --> 03:03:59.829]  Well, the exact title is, yes, Napolitano says U.S.
[03:03:59.829 --> 03:04:05.491]  should prepare for new flu outbreak soon, even if this one fizzles out.
[03:04:06.441 --> 03:04:14.527]  It's still posted on Forbes.com, but if you hit the link to go to it, it is now restricted and you cannot access the story.
[03:04:14.527 --> 03:04:15.788]  I know, that's amazing.
[03:04:15.788 --> 03:04:28.538]  I first saw that Sunday after a press conference, and they were all admitting it was a whole article, then later I went back and it was just her blurb at the top, and I've never seen a Reuters statement like that, but I think we were taping her Sunday.
[03:04:28.538 --> 03:04:33.502]  We ought to go pull that up from the actual press conference, or somebody should put that on YouTube.
[03:04:33.502 --> 03:04:34.963]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:34.963 --> 03:04:35.664]  Anything else, Don?
[03:04:36.570 --> 03:04:37.631]  That's it for the moment.
[03:04:37.631 --> 03:04:39.332]  Just keep up the fantastic work.
[03:04:39.332 --> 03:04:40.173]  Thank you.
[03:04:40.173 --> 03:04:41.655]  Yeah, we're trying our best here, sir.
[03:04:41.655 --> 03:04:44.178]  Thank you so much for all your support.
[03:04:44.178 --> 03:04:46.200]  Please spread the word about the radio show.
[03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:52.346]  People are ready to listen right now and they need to hear the wide spectrum of information to make up their own mind.
[03:04:52.346 --> 03:04:54.108]  We're not even saying what's happening here.
[03:04:54.108 --> 03:04:56.731]  We're just pointing out what's happened in the past and what's going on.
[03:04:57.972 --> 03:05:01.495]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:05:01.495 --> 03:05:06.900]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:05:06.900 --> 03:05:12.045]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:05:12.045 --> 03:05:23.176]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[03:05:23.556 --> 03:05:29.341]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:05:29.341 --> 03:05:35.606]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:05:35.606 --> 03:05:36.647]  What about you?

[03:05:57.794 --> 03:06:03.618]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:03.618 --> 03:06:10.604]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:11.184 --> 03:06:17.790]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:19.752]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:19.752 --> 03:06:22.254]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:06:22.254 --> 03:06:33.224]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:33.817 --> 03:06:35.499]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:35.499 --> 03:06:37.361]  It's about a one world government.
[03:06:37.361 --> 03:06:44.268]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:07:57.985 --> 03:08:03.590]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:10.995]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:08:10.995 --> 03:08:15.779]  We got 52 minutes left of this broadcast today.
[03:08:15.779 --> 03:08:26.748]  Jason Mermis will be back live tonight on the GCN Radio Network and out of my studio, simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv from the chair I'm sitting in in this studio.
[03:08:27.368 --> 03:08:51.111]  9 to midnight central standard time that's 10 p.m to 1 a.m eastern that is 7 to 10 pacific that is um 8 to 11 mountain so uh 9 to midnight tonight and the big things develop i will also be in studio for part of that within where i'll call in on the show i was on coast to coast a.m last night until 4 a.m central so i don't know if i'll be staying up late tonight
[03:08:52.052 --> 03:08:55.514]  Uh, but that was certainly a very informative transmission as well.
[03:08:55.514 --> 03:09:04.379]  George Norris got a lot of courage to let me and Steve Quayle on there to break down the history of government-sponsored terror and, uh, the obsession with biological weapons and the past things they've done.
[03:09:04.379 --> 03:09:08.961]  I don't know how he's able to have 16 million listeners a night and get out what he does.
[03:09:08.961 --> 03:09:11.442]  He's the only show out there that's mainstream and big.
[03:09:11.442 --> 03:09:13.003]  Second biggest radio show in the world.
[03:09:13.003 --> 03:09:14.204]  Only, second only to Limbaugh.
[03:09:14.784 --> 03:09:18.728]  We never tells you what you can or can't say, never censors.
[03:09:18.728 --> 03:09:24.273]  We just want to thank George Norrie and email him and let him know I appreciate what he's done for this radio show as well on our websites.
[03:09:24.273 --> 03:09:32.261]  I mean I would say 20% of our growth, I mean we owe probably 20% of everything we've been able to do to George Norrie.
[03:09:32.261 --> 03:09:34.043]  He's been interviewing me for five and a half years now.
[03:09:36.192 --> 03:09:37.733]  He took that show in a different direction.
[03:09:37.733 --> 03:09:42.357]  And he calls it the entertainment when he's doing the chupacabras and ghost stories and stuff.
[03:09:42.357 --> 03:09:43.858]  And he goes, then we do serious shows.
[03:09:43.858 --> 03:09:46.900]  And he'll say, this is a serious show tonight.
[03:09:46.900 --> 03:09:49.182]  And so I just, he's really taking that show in a different direction.
[03:09:49.182 --> 03:09:51.224]  I mean, it's still got a lot of wild stuff.
[03:09:51.224 --> 03:09:52.965]  My grandma stays up late at night and listen to it.
[03:09:52.965 --> 03:09:53.966]  She enjoys it all.
[03:09:53.966 --> 03:09:55.867]  It's a lot better than what's on TV.
[03:09:55.867 --> 03:09:57.488]  But it's, I'm not knocking what he does.
[03:09:57.488 --> 03:10:01.351]  The point is, is that he's taking it in a really good direction and just amazing courage.
[03:10:01.351 --> 03:10:02.552]  We appreciate George Norris.
[03:10:02.552 --> 03:10:04.093]  I'm thanking him here on air.
[03:10:04.093 --> 03:10:04.494]  I really don't.
[03:10:05.134 --> 03:10:06.415]  Really give credit where it's due.
[03:10:06.415 --> 03:10:08.276]  I'm just so focused on the mission.
[03:10:08.276 --> 03:10:12.780]  But to be able to get out the truth to 16 million people about what's happening was amazing.
[03:10:12.780 --> 03:10:16.442]  I want to go to Forrest and Lauren and Gabriel and Joe and many others.
[03:10:16.442 --> 03:10:18.484]  We're going to get to you quickly.
[03:10:18.484 --> 03:10:20.305]  We've got drcarley.com.
[03:10:20.305 --> 03:10:21.846]  That's her website, drcarley.com.
[03:10:21.846 --> 03:10:23.407]  Rebecca Carley.
[03:10:23.407 --> 03:10:24.408]  She is a surgeon.
[03:10:24.408 --> 03:10:25.389]  She is a medical doctor.
[03:10:26.289 --> 03:10:28.669]  Her son was given vaccines and got brain damage from it.
[03:10:28.669 --> 03:10:29.410]  That woke her up.
[03:10:29.410 --> 03:10:30.910]  She went down the rabbit hole.
[03:10:30.910 --> 03:10:36.651]  There's big organizations now of doctors that have been damaged, their children damaged by this, that are now fighting it.
[03:10:36.651 --> 03:10:39.951]  But last time she was on, just a month ago, she was saying, I think they're going to launch bird flu.
[03:10:39.951 --> 03:10:41.452]  And I could see them gearing up for it.
[03:10:41.452 --> 03:10:43.752]  And all the preparations and the vaccines are bioweapons.
[03:10:43.752 --> 03:10:49.993]  And I thought, you know, we need to get her on for her perspective, watching this and seeing what's going on.
[03:10:49.993 --> 03:10:54.414]  You know, we just had somebody who's really a virologist, Dr. Deagle, did a lot of research in that.
[03:10:55.274 --> 03:11:00.577]  I mean, Google his name and see him back in the 90s in news articles, you know, in programs and research.
[03:11:00.577 --> 03:11:05.020]  But it's good to have Dr. Rebecca Carley on with us today to take your calls.
[03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:07.942]  Dr. Carley, I have no idea what your view is on this.
[03:11:07.942 --> 03:11:12.185]  We've got you on here to get different perspectives, kind of in this think tank environment we're in.
[03:11:12.185 --> 03:11:17.208]  For everybody listening at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, the AM and FM listeners and
[03:11:17.728 --> 03:11:22.511]  Places like Chicago and Miami and the Bay Area into San Francisco.
[03:11:22.511 --> 03:11:27.214]  People listening all over the world on shortwave and satellite right now.
[03:11:27.214 --> 03:11:29.556]  What do you think's going on?
[03:11:29.556 --> 03:11:31.958]  Well, thank you very much for inviting me on again, Alex.
[03:11:31.958 --> 03:11:36.020]  And there's no question in my mind that this is an intentional release.
[03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:45.687]  And I was listening to you earlier as you were talking about how this is now a distraction from the investigation into the Bush administration's torture
[03:11:46.212 --> 03:11:56.202]  Uh, command and isn't that convenient that now everybody's forgetting about, you know, what we should be having now in this country, a version of the Nuremberg, uh, war trials.
[03:11:56.202 --> 03:12:10.716]  Uh, now instead we're all focused on this emerging pandemic and just the fact that it's got all these different particles in it from bird and human and, uh, swine, uh, where else could this have been made, but in the laboratory it's self-evident in my opinion.
[03:12:12.598 --> 03:12:15.439]  And then it's not even in the regular flu season.
[03:12:15.439 --> 03:12:17.899]  The real flus come from east to west.
[03:12:17.899 --> 03:12:20.500]  In the few other cases, it originates in North America on U.S.
[03:12:20.500 --> 03:12:21.220]  military bases.
[03:12:21.220 --> 03:12:26.802]  The last two swine flu outbreaks, 1918-1976, then the vaccines result in all those deaths.
[03:12:26.802 --> 03:12:27.662]  That's not even debated.
[03:12:27.662 --> 03:12:28.922]  That's in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
[03:12:31.423 --> 03:12:37.768]  How do you see it killing all these people in Mexico, but not killing people here yet?
[03:12:37.768 --> 03:12:42.371]  And it's killing healthy people in areas that aren't overcrowded and diseased like Mexico City.
[03:12:42.371 --> 03:12:46.854]  I mean, what makes you think this is a controlled bioweapon relation?
[03:12:46.854 --> 03:12:49.937]  Where does your gut, Dr. Carly, tell you this is going?
[03:12:49.937 --> 03:12:52.919]  Well, because they've been telling us for how many years now?
[03:12:52.919 --> 03:12:53.899]  At least a few years.
[03:12:53.899 --> 03:12:55.981]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[03:12:55.981 --> 03:12:58.643]  And they've been stockpiling bird flu vaccines.
[03:12:59.227 --> 03:13:10.732]  As we talked about on the last show of yours that I was on, this Baxter release of the bird flu virus combined with the human virus, I think that was their intention was to go the bird flu route.
[03:13:10.732 --> 03:13:17.755]  But even though the mainstream media blacked out that information from this country, there's too many shows such as yours that covered it.
[03:13:18.174 --> 03:13:19.995]  So they had to, you know, go to plan B.
[03:13:39.640 --> 03:14:01.112]  I believe we're going to see a pandemic, or at least a big scare out of this, because they admitted they mixed it with 18 different countries' vaccines, live bird flu, then suddenly people were dying that were in government care, and people were getting arrested saying they were ordered by unnamed pharmaceutical companies to inject people with this, even though they knew it was deadly, but then the big pharma doesn't get in trouble.
[03:14:01.112 --> 03:14:02.553]  You said they were launching it.
[03:14:02.553 --> 03:14:05.095]  You unequivocally said this is it.
[03:14:06.503 --> 03:14:07.564]  A month ago.
[03:14:07.564 --> 03:14:10.206]  How did you know that?
[03:14:10.206 --> 03:14:14.389]  Because I've been following these minions forever, and I know what they're up to.
[03:14:14.389 --> 03:14:22.155]  The Centers for Disease Creation, we have 1,088 level 3 bio-warfare labs in this country.
[03:14:22.155 --> 03:14:35.625]  They are making these viruses, and as a matter of fact, I just want to mention, I've been monitoring the mainstream media to see what's going on, and yesterday they had a news conference with a bunch of talking heads from the CDC, etc., on Fox.
[03:14:36.204 --> 03:14:41.948]  And a question was asked by a reporter, how do we know that this was not a bioweapon attack?
[03:14:41.948 --> 03:14:50.875]  And immediately Fox News ended the news conference and they brought it back to one of their, you know, talking head journalists and he changed the subject.
[03:14:50.875 --> 03:14:54.818]  Now that's the question people should be asking since they've been warning us.
[03:14:54.818 --> 03:14:56.919]  Oh, Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.
[03:14:56.919 --> 03:15:02.883]  Oh, we've been all scared about this possible bioweapon attack that any of these terrorists could launch on us.
[03:15:02.883 --> 03:15:04.905]  How come nobody's asking that question?
[03:15:07.093 --> 03:15:13.695]  By the way, you were on March 12th, and we need to go pull that clip when you said, I believe they've launched the attack.
[03:15:13.695 --> 03:15:18.157]  And then I went and listened to some other interviews with you and some shows you've done, and you weren't normally that alarmist.
[03:15:18.157 --> 03:15:20.098]  I was like, wow, she was serious.
[03:15:20.098 --> 03:15:21.758]  Really shook me.
[03:15:21.758 --> 03:15:26.700]  And I started saying, I believe that this was in the cards.
[03:15:26.700 --> 03:15:27.740]  So I agree with you.
[03:15:27.740 --> 03:15:31.902]  And just having you back, I'm remembering what you said.
[03:15:31.902 --> 03:15:34.923]  Well, if I could just comment, I don't consider myself alarmist.
[03:15:35.382 --> 03:15:40.608]  Unfortunately, the truth is very ugly at this point, but what I tell people is don't be afraid.
[03:15:40.608 --> 03:15:45.053]  The main thing you need to do is not allow them to inject you with a vaccination.
[03:15:45.053 --> 03:15:52.081]  And I heard you talking before with Dr. Deagle, there's many natural things that you can do to protect yourself.
[03:15:52.081 --> 03:15:54.765]  As a matter of fact, you can put colloidal silver in a
[03:15:56.095 --> 03:15:56.855]  We're good to go.
[03:16:21.874 --> 03:16:24.056]  Let's go ahead and play this clip I've been talking about all day.
[03:16:24.056 --> 03:16:26.539]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:16:26.539 --> 03:16:31.325]  This is CNN last night with a top general.
[03:16:31.325 --> 03:16:36.610]  Let me just pull up... I forget the pronunciation of his name.
[03:16:36.610 --> 03:16:40.275]  It's got a French mark on the last letter.
[03:16:40.275 --> 03:16:41.296]  How do you pronounce it?
[03:16:42.765 --> 03:16:43.225]  Bonnery.
[03:16:43.225 --> 03:16:44.586]  Yeah, this is General Bonnery.
[03:16:44.586 --> 03:16:46.067]  What a three-star general, retired.
[03:16:46.067 --> 03:16:49.369]  Saying we need to look at this being made in the lab.
[03:16:49.369 --> 03:16:52.551]  Let's go ahead and play that audio, John.
[03:16:52.551 --> 03:16:57.254]  But, you know, the key question we've got asked is, we think it came from Mexico.
[03:16:57.254 --> 03:17:00.196]  That is the conventional wisdom of most folks.
[03:17:00.196 --> 03:17:03.318]  The next question is, how did it start in Mexico?
[03:17:03.318 --> 03:17:05.440]  Where did it emanate from?
[03:17:05.440 --> 03:17:09.502]  We've been able to find that out in all previous pandemics.
[03:17:09.502 --> 03:17:12.164]  The question now is to get at the heart of how did this start
[03:17:12.625 --> 03:17:19.309]  Did it start from the occasion of viruses coming together?
[03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:21.751]  Or was it, did it come out of a lab?
[03:17:21.751 --> 03:17:27.694]  I mean, all those questions have to be answered.
[03:17:27.694 --> 03:17:40.622]  Studying this and interviewing literally scores of virologists and doctors and researchers over the years, they're all saying this is telltale designer virus, a lab virus, and they're calling it a swine flu and that's only a very small part of it.
[03:17:42.022 --> 03:18:03.117]  Well, I totally agree with you, and what I encourage your listeners to do is go to PBS.org, the propaganda broadcasting station, and get the DVD, Killer Flu, where they actually talk about how they dug up the dead bodies in Alaska so that they could deconstruct the virus that they called the 1918 Spanish Flu.
[03:18:03.117 --> 03:18:10.523]  And it's admitted right on this DVD that Jeffrey Toffenberger said, and I quote,
[03:18:10.965 --> 03:18:25.310]  If we can shed light on why the 1918 virus was so lethal and understand the genetic basis of that, that info can be applied to the emergence of new influenza strains.
[03:18:25.310 --> 03:18:30.132]  Now, what does that mean, applied to the emergence of new influenza strains?
[03:18:30.132 --> 03:18:35.554]  If you read between the lines, it means we can take that virus and combine it with others
[03:18:36.284 --> 03:18:43.872]  Well, they admit that the cover for the huge bioweapons program that's a hundred years old in this nation
[03:18:46.013 --> 03:19:14.340]  has been quote research for cures and uh... if anybody just googles uh... bio warfare ancient bio warfare you'll get all the university text and books have ever written on it with the greeks you know three thousand five hundred years ago and they had tides four thousand years ago and the egyptians three thousand years ago and the romans two thousand years ago and in the middle ages and the mongols in china using bio weapons on their enemies
[03:19:15.188 --> 03:19:19.669]  And then today, the public's like, oh, there's those things, bioweapons from governments.
[03:19:19.669 --> 03:19:21.390]  It's only little men in caves.
[03:19:21.390 --> 03:19:28.071]  And then the last big bioattack we had in 2001, the anthrax attacks, the White House admits they were on Cipro to fight it.
[03:19:28.071 --> 03:19:31.912]  Three weeks before it popped up, it turned out to be the most weaponized version of anthrax ever seen.
[03:19:31.912 --> 03:19:33.953]  It's a certified, patented, U.S.
[03:19:33.953 --> 03:19:35.553]  government Fort Detrick, Maryland variant.
[03:19:36.641 --> 03:19:39.184]  So they just have the M.O., the history, the past.
[03:19:39.184 --> 03:19:41.206]  They get the gain out of it, get the power.
[03:19:41.206 --> 03:19:43.148]  These vaccine companies.
[03:19:43.148 --> 03:19:48.835]  Dr. Carnley, let's talk about where you see all this going when we get back as we track the latest developments and information.
[03:19:48.835 --> 03:19:54.701]  We're trying to confirm right now at Press TV saying the World Health Organization is set to raise the swine flu alert to level 5.
[03:19:54.701 --> 03:19:56.663]  That's forced inoculations and martial law.
[03:19:58.146 --> 03:20:00.147]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:20:00.147 --> 03:20:07.109]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:20:07.109 --> 03:20:15.512]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:20:15.512 --> 03:20:21.234]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:20:21.634 --> 03:20:23.236]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:20:23.236 --> 03:20:25.438]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:20:25.438 --> 03:20:29.962]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:20:29.962 --> 03:20:32.184]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:20:32.184 --> 03:20:40.071]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:20:47.595 --> 03:20:49.495]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[03:21:01.460 --> 03:21:04.302]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:21:04.302 --> 03:21:10.187]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:21:10.187 --> 03:21:16.612]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:21:16.612 --> 03:21:18.654]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:21:18.654 --> 03:21:21.116]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:21:21.116 --> 03:21:30.864]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[03:21:31.324 --> 03:21:34.286]  That's fascism.
[03:21:34.286 --> 03:21:35.967]  It's not about left or right.
[03:21:35.967 --> 03:21:37.828]  It's about a one world government.
[03:21:37.828 --> 03:21:44.732]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:23:05.616 --> 03:23:13.603]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[03:23:13.863 --> 03:23:14.303]  We're good to go!
[03:23:43.695 --> 03:23:44.435]  We're good.
[03:24:05.222 --> 03:24:08.063]  The globalists are openly setting up their world government.
[03:24:08.063 --> 03:24:12.824]  They got one life and they want to live it up.
[03:24:12.824 --> 03:24:16.985]  They're taking their fight to the people of the planet.
[03:24:16.985 --> 03:24:22.927]  Will the public break the spell and stand up and say no?
[03:24:22.927 --> 03:24:29.048]  That is up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:29.048 --> 03:24:31.769]  You make the decision.
[03:24:31.769 --> 03:24:32.349]  All right.
[03:24:36.161 --> 03:24:38.902]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[03:24:38.902 --> 03:24:52.508]  And if you think I'm gonna sit around while the New World Order carries out these operations, you're thinking like a fool.
[03:24:52.508 --> 03:24:57.049]  Let's go ahead and talk to Forrest in Texas.
[03:24:57.049 --> 03:24:58.450]  Forrest, you're on the air.
[03:24:58.450 --> 03:25:00.351]  Welcome.
[03:25:00.351 --> 03:25:01.311]  Howdy, Alex.
[03:25:01.311 --> 03:25:02.011]  Great to be on your show.
[03:25:02.011 --> 03:25:03.092]  Good to talk to you.
[03:25:03.092 --> 03:25:03.292]  Yeah.
[03:25:04.102 --> 03:25:06.605]  Well done last night on the Coast to Coast AM.
[03:25:06.605 --> 03:25:11.690]  It was great how you and Steve Quayle brought up all the documented evidence and putting all the pieces together.
[03:25:11.690 --> 03:25:16.435]  How it's all interconnected of what's going on and when and where and how and why it's all going on.
[03:25:16.435 --> 03:25:17.897]  No, that was a fast-paced show.
[03:25:17.897 --> 03:25:20.320]  I mean, me and Steve were like piranhas with the information.
[03:25:21.698 --> 03:25:22.799]  Absolutely.
[03:25:22.799 --> 03:25:35.268]  Now, yes, this bioengineered vaccine flu thing that's been going on, well, it's taken people's minds off of all the other bad news.
[03:25:35.268 --> 03:25:36.589]  Now, at the same time,
[03:25:37.048 --> 03:25:48.503]  Our only choice is to have these tough times making us stronger, so to forgive past friends and neighbors and relatives, and to show unconditional love, and to get over all these...
[03:25:51.988 --> 03:25:55.270]  I mean, people release hormones, as the doctor can attest, under stress.
[03:25:55.270 --> 03:25:56.791]  Women don't feel good about themselves.
[03:25:56.791 --> 03:25:58.932]  Men are trying to... People are insecure.
[03:25:58.932 --> 03:26:00.013]  It's really a depressing thing.
[03:26:00.013 --> 03:26:02.014]  You need to feel good, feel happy.
[03:26:02.014 --> 03:26:03.295]  That boosts the immune system.
[03:26:03.295 --> 03:26:05.336]  You need to get plenty of sleep.
[03:26:05.336 --> 03:26:12.340]  Dr. Carley, as an MD, can you give folks some advice on ways to boost their immune system?
[03:26:12.340 --> 03:26:15.322]  I mean, get sleep, oil of oregano.
[03:26:15.322 --> 03:26:16.543]  What do you say from your research?
[03:26:17.452 --> 03:26:25.896]  Well there's never been a more important time to detoxify yourself and I do consults for people to teach them how to do that on an individual level.
[03:26:25.896 --> 03:26:40.004]  But now is the time to make sure you have access to organic food that is critically important, good water, stay away from the white coats and all of their drugs because all of these drugs have psychiatric side effects and that's something that people don't realize.
[03:26:40.004 --> 03:26:44.206]  You were talking with Dr. Deagle about the psychiatric effects of Tamiflu earlier.
[03:26:45.082 --> 03:26:48.404]  People are under mind control as well from Tele-Live Vision.
[03:26:48.404 --> 03:26:50.905]  There's so many ways that they're bringing us down.
[03:26:50.905 --> 03:26:56.128]  By the way, they admit Tamiflu has a hallucinogen in it.
[03:26:56.128 --> 03:26:59.610]  And then, of course, cops go crazy and kids go crazy.
[03:26:59.610 --> 03:27:04.713]  They're going to have cops out on the force on this stuff preemptively so they quote, don't get it.
[03:27:04.713 --> 03:27:07.814]  And they're going to wonder, this is going to be bad.
[03:27:07.814 --> 03:27:11.596]  Yes, as a matter of fact, I have the physician's desk reference right in front of me, 2009 edition.
[03:27:13.567 --> 03:27:27.273]  The psychiatric side effects of Tamiflu are delirium, including symptoms such as altered levels of consciousness, confusion, abnormal behavior, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, and nightmares.
[03:27:27.273 --> 03:27:30.414]  So this is the drug they're trying to tell us that we should take.
[03:27:30.414 --> 03:27:37.857]  And one thing I just want to mention, Alex, I haven't heard any of the other guests you've had on the show before ask a question about.
[03:27:37.857 --> 03:27:42.579]  What is the vaccine history of all of these people that are getting this strange flu?
[03:27:43.086 --> 03:27:47.191]  Were those people in Mexico given some kind of regular flu vaccine?
[03:27:47.191 --> 03:27:48.252]  Were these travelers?
[03:27:48.252 --> 03:27:52.878]  They're telling us that all these travelers from the states that now have this virus...
[03:27:53.308 --> 03:27:54.729]  That they all went to Mexico?
[03:27:54.729 --> 03:27:57.211]  Were they told to get a vaccine to go to Mexico?
[03:27:57.211 --> 03:27:59.592]  Let me expand, let me expand on that.
[03:27:59.592 --> 03:28:09.820]  The last two big swine flu outbreaks, 76 and 18, as you know, on record, they admit this, were triggered by vaccines.
[03:28:09.820 --> 03:28:15.223]  So, and on a military basis, so that's the first thing we should be asking.
[03:28:15.223 --> 03:28:18.406]  Yes, and one other thing I just want to inform the listeners.
[03:28:18.406 --> 03:28:20.107]  There's something called liposome.
[03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:20.820]  Thank you.
[03:28:40.253 --> 03:28:46.577]  That they could give people lipovaccines with a time-release element to it to deliver the antigen to the person.
[03:28:46.577 --> 03:29:00.245]  Isn't that associated from research with that type of wasp that goes and injects a type of virus that is slow-delayed for after its larva hatches out in the caterpillar?
[03:29:00.245 --> 03:29:00.785]  Yes.
[03:29:00.785 --> 03:29:05.227]  And if you go to my website, you can see a political cartoon of a white-coated mosquito.
[03:29:05.227 --> 03:29:06.868]  I mean, basically, that's what they're doing.
[03:29:06.868 --> 03:29:09.650]  So what I suspect is that this was all timed
[03:29:10.060 --> 03:29:19.588]  As I said before, I think they were planning on calling it a bird flu pandemic, but because of the Baxter faux pas, they had to change it now to a combo virus.
[03:29:19.588 --> 03:29:24.253]  And I suspect what they're probably going to do, because I've done many shows on this with Dr. Deagle and Dr. Ott,
[03:29:25.003 --> 03:29:29.184]  They already have millions of doses of the bird flu vaccine stockpiled.
[03:29:29.184 --> 03:29:34.385]  What I suspect they'll do is just change the label, stick on another label, and just give that as well.
[03:29:34.385 --> 03:29:35.905]  And that's what's going to kill millions of people.
[03:29:35.905 --> 03:29:37.185]  Well, they've been caught doing that.
[03:29:37.185 --> 03:29:43.007]  I mean, the last six years, it hasn't even been the right flu vaccine they come up with, but then people still line up and take it.
[03:29:43.007 --> 03:29:44.827]  Then, of course, have their seizures and die.
[03:29:44.827 --> 03:29:47.888]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:47.888 --> 03:29:49.268]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.268 --> 03:29:51.808]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.808 --> 03:29:54.509]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:57.870 --> 03:30:00.972]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:30:00.972 --> 03:30:06.475]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:30:06.475 --> 03:30:12.218]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:30:12.218 --> 03:30:13.679]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:30:13.679 --> 03:30:22.684]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:30:22.984 --> 03:30:24.824]  Now compare a Cal Bend Pure Soap.
[03:30:24.824 --> 03:30:29.045]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[03:30:51.949 --> 03:30:58.093]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[03:30:58.093 --> 03:31:03.916]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:03.916 --> 03:31:10.960]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:11.497 --> 03:31:18.082]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:18.082 --> 03:31:20.063]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:20.063 --> 03:31:22.565]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:31:22.565 --> 03:31:33.512]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:34.125 --> 03:31:35.785]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:35.785 --> 03:31:37.646]  It's about a one world government.
[03:31:37.646 --> 03:31:44.567]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:31:52.829 --> 03:31:54.390]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:54.390 --> 03:31:55.590]  The people strike back.
[03:31:58.564 --> 03:32:01.606]  Do you have more than $15,000 in credit card debt?

[03:32:36.067 --> 03:32:38.068]  Now, we don't have to file for bankruptcy.
[03:32:38.068 --> 03:32:41.590]  Managing one payment is giving me my life back.

[03:32:46.432 --> 03:32:46.472]  800-237-7660.
[03:33:04.264 --> 03:33:19.670]  Baby, you're a bad, bad thing Baby, you're a bad, bad thing Baby, you're a bad, bad thing Baby, you're a bad, bad thing You ever loved someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two?
[03:33:37.228 --> 03:33:41.312]  Okay, we got big problems now, folks.
[03:33:41.312 --> 03:33:44.094]  This just in, it's up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:44.094 --> 03:33:47.096]  Kurt Nemo just sent it to me.
[03:33:47.096 --> 03:33:52.141]  They did a bad, bad thing.
[03:33:52.141 --> 03:34:01.148]  Because if this thing is person-to-person like they say it is, and it appears they are covering up just how many people are really sick,
[03:34:04.116 --> 03:34:06.038]  And in trouble.
[03:34:06.038 --> 03:34:12.603]  You know, we've said that if it starts killing people in the U.S., the way it's wildly spreading, then we got a problem.
[03:34:12.603 --> 03:34:13.163]  Two L.A.
[03:34:13.163 --> 03:34:16.005]  County deaths possible related to swine flu.
[03:34:16.005 --> 03:34:17.927]  Coroner says, but that's good news.
[03:34:17.927 --> 03:34:21.270]  They're not confirming it's from swine flu, but maybe it's a cover-up.
[03:34:21.270 --> 03:34:22.150]  Maybe it's hype.
[03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:23.892]  You don't know the lying criminal government.
[03:34:24.352 --> 03:34:31.642]  The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office is investigating two recent deaths that officials say can be related to the recent global swine flu outbreak.
[03:34:31.642 --> 03:34:34.927]  However, no tests have come back positive for the swine flu.
[03:34:34.927 --> 03:34:36.309]  Then why are they saying this?
[03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:39.553]  And medical examiners have not officially determined the cause of the deaths.
[03:34:40.442 --> 03:34:48.806]  Update, 930 AM, Coroner Spokesman Craig Harvey said his office will collect specimens from the deceased and send them to the county public department.
[03:34:48.806 --> 03:34:50.447]  Are they Hispanic?
[03:34:50.447 --> 03:34:56.010]  Because if it's in, this is really going to be very specific, if it only is killing Hispanics.
[03:34:56.010 --> 03:34:59.672]  Which was determined whether either person died from the swine flu.
[03:34:59.672 --> 03:35:00.512]  If so, the U.S.
[03:35:00.512 --> 03:35:05.575]  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be notified, Harvey said.
[03:35:05.575 --> 03:35:09.117]  Coroner Spokesman Craig Harvey said Bell, Flower,
[03:35:10.549 --> 03:35:20.357]  Medical Center reported the death of 33-year-old Long Beach resident Monday afternoon from symptoms resembling swine flu.
[03:35:20.357 --> 03:35:28.543]  The man was taken to the hospital Saturday complaining of shortness of breath and lymphoma, whatever that means.
[03:35:28.543 --> 03:35:32.927]  Doctors later diagnosed the patient with pneumonia, Harvey said.
[03:35:32.927 --> 03:35:35.569]  And now somebody else has died but doesn't say who.
[03:35:37.028 --> 03:35:37.848]  The man died April 22nd.
[03:35:37.848 --> 03:35:41.190]  Let me go ahead and print that for me, guys.
[03:35:41.190 --> 03:35:42.651]  Let me go ahead and go to this other one here.
[03:35:42.651 --> 03:35:45.172]  He sent me another one.
[03:35:45.172 --> 03:35:46.372]  Oh boy!
[03:35:46.372 --> 03:35:48.373]  We'll continue to track that as it unfolds.
[03:35:48.373 --> 03:35:53.595]  Lauren in Colorado, you're on the air with our guest, Dr. Rebecca Carley.
[03:35:53.595 --> 03:35:54.976]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:35:54.976 --> 03:35:56.077]  Yes, I can.
[03:35:56.077 --> 03:35:57.917]  Okay, good deal.
[03:35:57.917 --> 03:36:04.400]  Praise be to the master intelligence of the universe for letting me be able to speak to you, and praise to you on your good work, Alex.
[03:36:06.474 --> 03:36:26.599]  What I wanted to talk about here was these are my own opinions because I'm not a medical professional but I have studied virology to a certain degree and I think everybody needs to be very concerned about taking any kind of enforced vaccinations.
[03:36:26.599 --> 03:36:30.880]  The reason for that is that basically the
[03:36:32.249 --> 03:36:40.191]  The strain that's going around is showing to have an extremely good transmissivity.
[03:36:40.191 --> 03:36:53.855]  And if by chance there is a H5N1 virus in these vaccinations, well, then the person getting vaccinated is infected with the current strain.
[03:36:54.900 --> 03:36:59.985]  Anybody that goes into the hospital and they say, well, let's give you this shot to make you feel better.
[03:36:59.985 --> 03:37:08.312]  They're infected with the current strain, and then they get infected with the highly lethal H5N1 strain.
[03:37:08.312 --> 03:37:17.800]  Well, through genetic reassortment, which is where the genes of the virus swap, that's probably the fastest way possible to get this out everywhere.
[03:37:17.800 --> 03:37:21.443]  No, no, that's what the scientists and doctors in the Czech Republic were saying when they
[03:37:22.324 --> 03:37:26.365]  Well, first of all, nobody should be taking any vaccine.
[03:37:26.365 --> 03:37:30.026]  I encourage the caller to go to my website, drcarley.com.
[03:37:51.826 --> 03:37:53.948]  Read some of my documents.
[03:37:53.948 --> 03:37:57.231]  Especially the document, Science of Vaccine Damage.
[03:37:57.231 --> 03:38:08.260]  Vaccines don't just give you the infection, they cause a corruption in your immune system that leads to all autoimmune disease, non-traumatic seizures, cancer, and genetic damage in people and in pets.
[03:38:08.260 --> 03:38:12.403]  These vaccines have the potential to cause the extinction of humanity.
[03:38:12.403 --> 03:38:18.148]  This is how serious this insane practice of vaccination is, which is nothing more than medical voodoo.
[03:38:18.669 --> 03:38:22.091]  So, vaccines do not protect you, they give you the infection.
[03:38:22.091 --> 03:38:36.641]  And even if they tell you that the virus is quote-unquote attenuated, meaning that it's allegedly made less pathogenic by passing it through different tissue cultures, that's how they get these viruses to combine with viruses in other tissue cultures.
[03:38:36.641 --> 03:38:38.743]  And these things can reactivate themselves.
[03:38:38.743 --> 03:38:44.587]  If you have any kind of virus in your body, and you're injected with a vaccine, just as the caller was saying,
[03:38:45.546 --> 03:38:47.727]  These viruses re-assort with each other.
[03:38:47.727 --> 03:38:48.988]  They combine DNA.
[03:38:48.988 --> 03:38:51.369]  They produce new mutants.
[03:38:51.369 --> 03:38:54.890]  And this has the potential of causing a huge problem.
[03:38:54.890 --> 03:38:56.631]  Okay, Lauren, thank you for the call.
[03:38:56.631 --> 03:38:58.072]  Go ahead, Doctor.
[03:38:58.072 --> 03:39:04.375]  Yeah, and that's why what I'm trying to get people to realize is the whole vaccine situation is a scam on its face.
[03:39:04.375 --> 03:39:07.116]  And that is what's going to cause all the deaths.
[03:39:07.529 --> 03:39:15.338]  I encourage the listeners to check out a book, Vaccination of the Silent Killer, A Clear and Present Danger, by Ida Honaroff and Eleanor McBean.
[03:39:15.834 --> 03:39:33.467]  They talk about the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which was caused by inoculations... Hey, Ron Paul in 76 as a doctor was in a book exposing the swine flu, saying it's a premeditated scam to take control of society, to sell vaccines, it's a fraud, it's the vaccines that are hurting you.
[03:39:33.467 --> 03:39:35.688]  Let me give folks some new developments here.
[03:39:35.688 --> 03:39:42.973]  New York City Health Commissioner, this is Fox News, many hundreds of school students sick with suspected swine flu.
[03:39:42.973 --> 03:39:44.935]  We knew this last night from We Are Changers.
[03:39:45.855 --> 03:39:51.961]  Uh, who have, uh, you know, girlfriends and things that are in college, where they're saying, you know, everybody's basically sick.
[03:39:51.961 --> 03:39:57.025]  The calls we're getting from Mexico from doctors and others are saying 70% of people are sick.
[03:39:57.025 --> 03:39:59.727]  I mean, if you can believe that, that is just unbelievable.
[03:39:59.727 --> 03:40:06.453]  City Health Commissioner Thomas Friedman also said Tuesday that many hundreds of school children are sick with suspected cases of swine flu.
[03:40:06.453 --> 03:40:10.636]  Bloomberg says the hospitalizations are separate from the outbreak at the private school in Queens.
[03:40:11.477 --> 03:40:14.759]  We know somebody at the Queens Hospital that's in hospital from that.
[03:40:14.759 --> 03:40:20.642]  The mayor says he hospitalized our children in the Bronx and an adult in Brooklyn.
[03:40:20.642 --> 03:40:22.823]  Notice it's always the government training camp where this happens.
[03:40:22.823 --> 03:40:31.148]  And you notice nationwide all the quote kids, they get their federal funds who hadn't been vaccinated, they've been vaccinated in the last two weeks.
[03:40:31.148 --> 03:40:37.411]  I bet our bottom dollar it'll come out in a week or two when nobody's paying attention that the vaccines have triggered this.
[03:40:37.411 --> 03:40:38.212]  It's always the same.
[03:40:38.934 --> 03:40:40.115]  Exactly.
[03:40:40.115 --> 03:40:43.156]  And I just want to say, I have CNN on in the background right now.
[03:40:43.156 --> 03:40:52.202]  We have this minion on Napolitano on CNN now, reassuring people that there's no chance that this could possibly be coming from pigs.
[03:40:52.202 --> 03:40:58.125]  Now, I want people to also realize that all of the food source animals are inoculated, even farm-raised fish.
[03:40:58.593 --> 03:41:05.055]  Okay, so here she is on Tell-A-Live Vision telling people there's no way that the food products could be causing this.
[03:41:05.055 --> 03:41:06.236]  How do they know that?
[03:41:06.236 --> 03:41:08.436]  She's on the Tell-A-Live Vision?
[03:41:08.436 --> 03:41:10.657]  You should believe the Tell-A-Live Vision.
[03:41:10.657 --> 03:41:16.239]  Speaking of the Tell-A-Live Vision, punch up CNN real quick for us, the propaganda channel or C-SPAN.
[03:41:16.239 --> 03:41:17.299]  I'll have it.
[03:41:17.299 --> 03:41:18.900]  But again, more cases there.
[03:41:18.900 --> 03:41:19.560]  Here's another one.
[03:41:19.560 --> 03:41:23.321]  Rio Grande City School closed due to swine flu.
[03:41:23.321 --> 03:41:26.242]  What's that, guys?
[03:41:26.242 --> 03:41:27.123]  Our cable box is out.
[03:41:27.123 --> 03:41:27.683]  What do they do with it?
[03:41:28.544 --> 03:41:30.885]  Cookie Monster take it?
[03:41:30.885 --> 03:41:32.426]  I tell ya, that satellite is the cruddiest.
[03:41:32.426 --> 03:41:34.466]  We can't get cable where my office is.
[03:41:34.466 --> 03:41:36.067]  These satellites are real pieces of junk.
[03:41:36.067 --> 03:41:37.768]  I just want that on record.
[03:41:37.768 --> 03:41:40.269]  Uh, it says, Retired Army General Russell.
[03:41:40.269 --> 03:41:41.429]  Honorary on CNN.
[03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:43.030]  Again, the swine flu come from lab.
[03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:44.751]  Los Angeles Probe 2.
[03:41:44.751 --> 03:41:47.552]  Possible deaths from swine flu.
[03:41:47.552 --> 03:41:49.373]  Um, this is really getting insane.
[03:41:49.373 --> 03:41:51.834]  Okay, let's take another call here.
[03:41:51.834 --> 03:41:53.975]  Gabriel in New York.
[03:41:53.975 --> 03:41:54.415]  Go ahead.
[03:41:55.598 --> 03:42:09.129]  Hey Alex Jones, it's Gabriel Brown from all around New York looking at checkerboards in the sky off these chemtrails, but I wanted to give a... Hey, that's better than Air Force One and the F-16s screaming between the buildings yesterday for a quote, photo op.
[03:42:09.129 --> 03:42:10.650]  Go ahead.
[03:42:10.650 --> 03:42:19.678]  Um, I think that the comments that Joe Biden made months ago might be interesting because he said international incident, which is what we're seeing now.
[03:42:19.678 --> 03:42:23.081]  Of course, you've got the chemtrails, which are making our immune system
[03:42:24.232 --> 03:42:25.253]  Go down.
[03:42:25.253 --> 03:42:29.557]  You got, of course, marketing between the TV and Big Pharma.
[03:42:29.557 --> 03:42:34.361]  The fact that, I mean, look at the 1980s with the crack cocaine epidemic.
[03:42:34.361 --> 03:42:37.364]  You have the CIA admits they shipped that in.
[03:42:37.364 --> 03:42:39.987]  Again, it's just everything criminal comes from this elite.
[03:42:39.987 --> 03:42:41.988]  It's just unbelievable how bad they are.
[03:42:41.988 --> 03:42:47.994]  And you have the Marshall plans, which you've been following your show for the last three years, and the mass graves.
[03:42:48.769 --> 03:42:52.492]  I mean, everything you say about the elite is absolutely true.
[03:42:52.492 --> 03:42:53.714]  I've read history books.
[03:42:53.714 --> 03:42:56.616]  I have family members who work for all these industries.
[03:42:56.616 --> 03:42:58.558]  I know exactly what you're talking about.
[03:42:58.558 --> 03:43:00.540]  You do not lie about these people.
[03:43:00.540 --> 03:43:06.025]  I've been affected by eugenics, and I'm fighting these people on every level I can.
[03:43:06.025 --> 03:43:06.545]  Me too.
[03:43:06.545 --> 03:43:07.466]  God bless you.
[03:43:07.466 --> 03:43:10.048]  Look, I wish this wasn't true.
[03:43:10.048 --> 03:43:12.611]  Look, I don't want to work 16, 17, 18 hours a day.
[03:43:12.611 --> 03:43:14.172]  I worked more than 18 yesterday.
[03:43:15.618 --> 03:43:17.699]  I worked 20 hours yesterday.
[03:43:17.699 --> 03:43:18.120]  That's not true.
[03:43:45.558 --> 03:43:45.858]  Yeah, sure.
[03:43:45.858 --> 03:43:46.518]  You do a great job.
[03:43:46.518 --> 03:43:48.439]  I want to give a shout-out to my friend, Mike Schaefer.
[03:43:48.439 --> 03:43:51.120]  We are a change, and again, I've been researching this for about 13 years now.
[03:43:51.120 --> 03:43:55.721]  I was woken up about three years ago when I came across your show by mistake for a Winamp link.
[03:44:15.638 --> 03:44:18.402]  So keep your streams out there, keep them in random places.
[03:44:18.402 --> 03:44:21.366]  People find that stuff, like myself, had no idea.
[03:44:21.366 --> 03:44:23.028]  No, I know, that's how we listen.
[03:44:23.028 --> 03:44:28.054]  AM and FM stations getting a lot more shortwave, huge audience all over the world, but our internet, and I appreciate your call.
[03:44:30.424 --> 03:44:36.689]  Because of our different servers and platforms and the poor man's way we do this, we're number one on ShowCast.
[03:44:36.689 --> 03:44:41.432]  Number one talk, number one music, number one, that's the big global aggregator that tracks everything.
[03:44:41.432 --> 03:44:42.493]  We're number one.
[03:44:42.493 --> 03:44:45.215]  And that's not even what half our streams.
[03:44:45.215 --> 03:44:53.922]  I mean, it's amazing to have, you know, 30,000 people tuning in just on the internet, because an AM and FM audience is much bigger.
[03:44:53.922 --> 03:44:55.984]  Our AM and FM audience is probably 50 times that.
[03:44:56.664 --> 03:45:00.828]  You know, one big AM might have 30,000, 40,000 listening at one time.
[03:45:00.828 --> 03:45:08.255]  You know, Ted's actually gotten the ratings before he's a network, so he bought a big aggregate of them just from our affiliates that do subscribe.
[03:45:08.255 --> 03:45:10.197]  You only get them from those that subscribe.
[03:45:10.197 --> 03:45:19.645]  And 315,000 listeners per 15 minutes is what our AM and FM QM is or whatever, or no, it's listening at one time.
[03:45:19.645 --> 03:45:20.786]  I forget all the numbers, but it's 315,000 listening every
[03:45:23.246 --> 03:45:27.768]  Every 15 minutes of our time spent listening is a lot longer than the average 18 minutes.
[03:45:27.768 --> 03:45:28.729]  Something like an hour.
[03:45:28.729 --> 03:45:30.189]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:31.510]  Just shy of an hour.
[03:45:31.510 --> 03:45:32.430]  And so there's that.
[03:45:32.430 --> 03:45:34.091]  Then there's shortwave internet.
[03:45:34.091 --> 03:45:36.152]  And hundreds of thousands tune in on the web.
[03:45:36.152 --> 03:45:38.953]  But the cool part about the web is it's spread out.
[03:45:38.953 --> 03:45:42.595]  It's a small audience compared to all our other AM and FM's and shortwave.
[03:45:42.595 --> 03:45:45.136]  But it's people spread everywhere.
[03:45:45.136 --> 03:45:49.398]  You know, Mexico City and South Korea and Japan and Russia and Germany.
[03:45:49.938 --> 03:45:51.880]  Canada and everywhere.
[03:45:51.880 --> 03:46:00.227]  I mean, you know, every time there's a mass shooting at Blacksburg, we had a guy across the street, you know, as it was happening, you know, just whatever it is, we've got the listeners.
[03:46:00.227 --> 03:46:01.028]  It's so amazing.
[03:46:01.028 --> 03:46:04.951]  Let's take another call to Rebecca Carley on the line with us.
[03:46:04.951 --> 03:46:07.753]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in California.
[03:46:07.753 --> 03:46:08.494]  Go ahead, Joe.
[03:46:08.494 --> 03:46:09.535]  Alex, how are you?
[03:46:09.535 --> 03:46:09.635]  Good.
[03:46:09.635 --> 03:46:10.536]  How are you doing, Alex?
[03:46:10.536 --> 03:46:11.036]  Good.
[03:46:11.036 --> 03:46:16.261]  Listen, I have, unfortunately, my brother got caught over there, but he's in Coastal,
[03:46:16.988 --> 03:46:23.110]  He left before this whole nonsense of the designer virus took place.
[03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:25.011]  And he called and spoke to me yesterday.
[03:46:25.011 --> 03:46:38.575]  And basically, just about an hour before he spoke, early in the morning, Pacific Standard Time, the hotel employees at the resort at Cozumel were inoculated.
[03:46:38.575 --> 03:46:40.596]  They were required to take vaccinations.
[03:46:41.831 --> 03:46:44.012]  Because it was going on in the mainland in Mexico.
[03:46:44.012 --> 03:46:45.553]  Yeah, we've been confirming that.
[03:46:45.553 --> 03:46:46.993]  That's probably what's giving it to him.
[03:46:46.993 --> 03:46:47.473]  Go ahead.
[03:46:47.473 --> 03:46:48.194]  Of course!
[03:46:48.194 --> 03:46:49.814]  That's number one.
[03:46:49.814 --> 03:46:58.998]  Number two, I told him, my brother says, you know, I woke him up years ago and he said, he asked the employee, hey, can you let me know what the name of the vaccine that they gave you?
[03:46:58.998 --> 03:47:00.938]  I'm interested in knowing what it was.
[03:47:00.938 --> 03:47:01.999]  So we're trying to find out.
[03:47:01.999 --> 03:47:03.199]  He hasn't called me.
[03:47:03.199 --> 03:47:07.361]  Secondly, you know, with all this throwing around, and I'm sure you remember this.
[03:47:07.361 --> 03:47:10.122]  I was the one that you posted my article, the author,
[03:47:10.698 --> 03:47:14.862]  It was entitled, uh, is Joe Biden the fortune teller of terror?
[03:47:14.862 --> 03:47:18.025]  Do you remember his famous, uh, particular article?
[03:47:18.025 --> 03:47:25.251]  I talked about how he, quote, he said, mark my words, mark my words, it will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama.
[03:47:25.251 --> 03:47:27.473]  Likely, like, like they did JFK.
[03:47:27.473 --> 03:47:37.522]  Remember I said, standing here in your room, if you do not hear anything else I said, watch what we are going to have an international crisis, a generated crisis to test the middle of the sky.
[03:47:38.915 --> 03:47:44.667]  I mean, obviously, I first thought it was a financial crisis, but the way this is going, could this be it?
[03:47:44.667 --> 03:47:47.793]  Is this what Mr. Biden, you know, had foreknowledge of?
[03:47:49.527 --> 03:47:51.568]  Look, and that was through a group of donors.
[03:47:51.568 --> 03:47:59.813]  He didn't know that was being recorded, just like when Obama said, don't worry, we're going to get their guns, you know, these Bible-clutching gun, you know, clutching these bitter clingers.
[03:47:59.813 --> 03:48:02.914]  And yeah, no, no, I mean, look, my gut tells me it's staged.
[03:48:02.914 --> 03:48:05.996]  I just can't tell whether it's a real mega-pandemic or not.
[03:48:05.996 --> 03:48:07.737]  But imagine the slavery of that.
[03:48:07.737 --> 03:48:08.597]  Here in the U.S.
[03:48:08.597 --> 03:48:16.442]  and in Mexico, they're just telling employees and medical workers and police, you've got to take this shot, when there's no way they've got a vaccine for this unless they already
[03:48:17.082 --> 03:48:17.842]  Yes, it's self-evident.
[03:48:17.842 --> 03:48:20.783]  How could they possibly have a vaccine ready to go?
[03:48:20.783 --> 03:48:24.545]  The only way they could have a vaccine ready is if they made the virus in the first place.
[03:48:43.695 --> 03:48:45.596]  Most likely released it through a vaccine.
[03:48:45.596 --> 03:48:56.700]  As I said, we have to find out where those victims in Mexico, Canada, wherever, the United States, who allegedly traveled to Mexico, did they get a flu vaccine before they left?
[03:48:56.700 --> 03:48:58.680]  I'm sure the answer is probably yes.
[03:48:58.680 --> 03:49:01.761]  And then they're telling people, we have a vaccine for you to take.
[03:49:01.761 --> 03:49:04.862]  Just that alone should make these people start asking questions.
[03:49:04.862 --> 03:49:05.402]  Wait a minute.
[03:49:05.402 --> 03:49:10.304]  How could you have made a vaccine and how could you have tested it to see if it was safe?
[03:49:10.304 --> 03:49:12.565]  As we discussed on the show last time I was on.
[03:49:13.069 --> 03:49:20.172]  These homeless people in Poland, many of them died after they were tested with this bird flu vaccine.
[03:49:20.172 --> 03:49:26.194]  So how do we know we're not just having another mass experiment right now with this vaccine?
[03:49:26.194 --> 03:49:26.574]  I agree.
[03:49:26.574 --> 03:49:35.538]  We read an article saying how do we know this isn't another bad vaccine or by design and tie it into all the deaths and all the past things that have happened.
[03:49:35.538 --> 03:49:38.199]  Going back to Joe in California, anything else sir?
[03:49:38.732 --> 03:49:39.232]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:49:39.232 --> 03:49:40.513]  One quick question, Alex.
[03:49:40.513 --> 03:49:44.855]  You're the one that posted it, and I haven't heard much about it, and I listen to you every day.
[03:49:44.855 --> 03:50:01.765]  What happened to that video clip that you posted with regards to Dr. John Carlo, who stated in his press conference, whether he did so intentionally or it slipped out, whichever the case may have been, about this so-called swine flu was cultured, quote-unquote, in a laboratory?
[03:50:02.600 --> 03:50:03.981]  No, I mean, that was all over the news.
[03:50:03.981 --> 03:50:06.283]  It's just in the archives of the site.
[03:50:06.283 --> 03:50:15.569]  I think the headline on that was that this flu is a mix, a rare mix of other viruses.
[03:50:15.569 --> 03:50:17.970]  And that was in Dallas.
[03:50:17.970 --> 03:50:25.855]  He was the medical examiner saying, but you can say that meant we've cultured it and it's this or they grew it in a lab.
[03:50:25.855 --> 03:50:29.458]  But now we have a general on CNN saying openly it could have been made in a lab.
[03:50:30.481 --> 03:50:32.982]  The video clip was put up by you.
[03:50:32.982 --> 03:50:33.762]  I saved it.
[03:50:33.762 --> 03:50:36.383]  And when I tried to send it to somebody, it had been taken off.
[03:50:36.383 --> 03:50:37.363]  That's why I'm bringing it up.
[03:50:37.363 --> 03:50:39.864]  Maybe you can just keep posting it so it doesn't get lost.
[03:50:39.864 --> 03:50:42.144]  Yeah, we've got one and a half people running InfoWarriors.
[03:50:42.144 --> 03:50:44.705]  It's probably some program problem or something.
[03:50:44.705 --> 03:50:46.085]  But we'll repost that video.
[03:50:46.085 --> 03:50:49.146]  In fact, email Kurt and ask him to repost that Medical Examiner clip.
[03:50:49.146 --> 03:50:50.266]  Final segment straight ahead.
[03:50:50.266 --> 03:50:50.646]  Stay with us.
[03:50:50.646 --> 03:50:52.327]  It's Jason Bermas tonight, 9 to midnight.
[03:50:52.327 --> 03:50:54.227]  9 to midnight, Central Center Time.
[03:50:54.227 --> 03:50:56.028]  The InfoWarrior with the one, the only, Bernie.
[03:50:57.952 --> 03:50:59.253]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:50:59.253 --> 03:51:04.835]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:51:04.835 --> 03:51:09.857]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:51:09.857 --> 03:51:15.439]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:51:15.439 --> 03:51:20.661]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:51:20.661 --> 03:51:22.522]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:51:22.970 --> 03:51:27.774]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[03:51:27.774 --> 03:51:28.895]  And here's the best part.
[03:51:28.895 --> 03:51:31.677]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:51:31.677 --> 03:51:35.580]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:51:35.580 --> 03:51:38.762]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:38.762 --> 03:51:41.004]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:51:41.004 --> 03:51:41.945]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:51:41.945 --> 03:51:42.185]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:51:42.185 --> 03:51:43.246]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[03:51:52.062 --> 03:51:54.623]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:51:54.623 --> 03:51:58.505]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[03:51:58.505 --> 03:52:03.748]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:04.546 --> 03:52:10.411]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:10.411 --> 03:52:16.956]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:16.956 --> 03:52:18.898]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:18.898 --> 03:52:21.360]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:32.249]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:34.534 --> 03:52:36.195]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:36.195 --> 03:52:38.057]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:38.057 --> 03:52:44.982]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:54:03.276 --> 03:54:08.280]  Dr. Rebecca Carley, I wanted to tell you about two quick sponsors that make this show possible that I also believe in.
[03:54:08.280 --> 03:54:10.861]  One of them's New Silver Solution.
[03:54:10.861 --> 03:54:15.945]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[03:54:15.945 --> 03:54:18.687]  Well, you've heard all these medical doctors tell you, Loyal Silver.
[03:54:19.608 --> 03:54:23.853]  Is there something that can kill bacteria that is safe and can be used on a daily or weekly basis?
[03:54:23.853 --> 03:54:31.380]  The new silver solution is a highly effective, potent, nanoparticulate solution that is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
[03:54:31.380 --> 03:54:32.842]  It is non-toxic to humans and animals.
[03:54:32.842 --> 03:54:37.606]  The new silver solution is patented and has been exclusively, extensively tested.

[03:55:28.078 --> 03:55:29.459]  That's HomeGain.com.
[03:55:29.459 --> 03:55:30.940]  Okay, let's take a few final calls.
[03:55:30.940 --> 03:55:33.101]  Kelly in Virginia, then Roland.
[03:55:33.101 --> 03:55:34.441]  Roland of Gilead.
[03:55:34.441 --> 03:55:36.022]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Kelly.
[03:55:36.894 --> 03:55:37.834]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[03:55:37.834 --> 03:55:39.255]  Good.
[03:55:39.255 --> 03:55:48.138]  My question is, I'm standing out on my deck right now, and since I woke up this morning, they have been viciously spraying chemtrails over Richmond.
[03:55:48.138 --> 03:55:51.400]  Some of them are flying very low, some are flying very high.
[03:55:51.400 --> 03:55:57.022]  My question is, is there any way possible that the swine flu could be dropped via that way?
[03:55:57.782 --> 03:56:09.667]  Generally they spray it at below 2,000 feet when they want to hit you, but they can spray, and they've done government tests, they're declassified, thousands of miles away to hit a certain area of the jet stream where it dumps.
[03:56:09.667 --> 03:56:14.809]  There's only key areas where the jet stream comes down to close to sea level.
[03:56:14.809 --> 03:56:16.410]  Dr. Carley?
[03:56:16.410 --> 03:56:17.290]  I totally agree.
[03:56:17.290 --> 03:56:22.832]  They could be delivering this in many ways, but the most dangerous way is through a needle.
[03:56:22.832 --> 03:56:26.734]  And so that's why people have to do everything they can to get their immune system working,
[03:56:27.248 --> 03:56:32.992]  And my most important message to the listeners is do not take the vaccine no matter what they threaten you with.
[03:56:32.992 --> 03:56:36.594]  If enough of us just say no, what are they going to do?
[03:56:36.594 --> 03:56:42.879]  They stage a big crisis, they hype it, they try to get people to go along with what they're doing to set the precedent of their control.
[03:56:42.879 --> 03:56:48.643]  Get the word out to everybody what's really going on and a great place is again this radio show ladies and gentlemen.
[03:56:48.643 --> 03:56:49.803]  Thank you so much Kelly.
[03:56:49.803 --> 03:56:51.765]  Roland in Nevada, you're on the air.
[03:56:54.449 --> 03:56:56.310]  That's kind of interesting.
[03:56:56.310 --> 03:57:04.293]  I totally forgot about the chemtrails, but yesterday, I'm here in Nevada actually, and I was driving out.
[03:57:04.293 --> 03:57:10.215]  I've noticed that they've been putting chemtrails on the west side of the skies.
[03:57:10.215 --> 03:57:21.279]  The last couple of months it's been here and there, but yesterday specifically I went out in the afternoon around 10, 11 o'clock and chemtrails, I noticed there was a massive amount of them.
[03:57:21.872 --> 03:57:36.465]  And just to make this quick, by 6, 8, 8 p.m., well, I'd say before sundown, so probably about 6 or 7, there was a massive, massive, I looked up and I said, well, I never saw a cloud, a tower of a cloud that high here.
[03:57:36.465 --> 03:57:40.349]  And it's actually not a cloud that I'm looking at.
[03:57:40.349 --> 03:57:45.233]  I noticed a couple more planes, and it's actually completely consumed the valley.
[03:57:46.778 --> 03:57:47.619]  It's amazing.
[03:57:47.619 --> 03:57:50.120]  But anyways, back to my point.
[03:57:50.120 --> 03:57:52.842]  Alex, I want to thank you for everything that you've been doing.
[03:57:52.842 --> 03:57:57.084]  I've run upon, I came across some things.
[03:57:57.084 --> 03:58:01.227]  I know a lot of Bible readers listen to your show as well.
[03:58:01.227 --> 03:58:04.609]  And I came across a video on YouTube.
[03:58:04.609 --> 03:58:07.450]  This guy was basically breaking down the scriptures of the Bible.
[03:58:07.450 --> 03:58:10.632]  Hey, tell us the video because the show's over.
[03:58:10.632 --> 03:58:11.873]  Tell us the video, the show's over.
[03:58:12.728 --> 03:58:14.649]  Oh man, I wish I had a link for you.
[03:58:14.649 --> 03:58:15.590]  Okay, listen, we're out of time.
[03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:16.831]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:58:16.831 --> 03:58:18.432]  I want to thank Dr. Carley for joining us.
[03:58:18.432 --> 03:58:20.053]  The website is drcarley.com.
[03:58:20.053 --> 03:58:21.074]  Dr. Rebecca Carley.
[03:58:21.074 --> 03:58:22.995]  We'll talk to you again soon as this develops.
[03:58:22.995 --> 03:58:25.877]  We're preparing for the worst and hoping for the best here.
[03:58:25.877 --> 03:58:26.978]  Thank you so much, Dr. Carley.
[03:58:26.978 --> 03:58:28.919]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:28.919 --> 03:58:30.320]  Alright, retransmission starts now.
[03:58:30.320 --> 03:58:33.342]  Jam-packed first hour on the streams.

[03:58:34.402 --> 03:58:37.685]  They can tune in right now at the InfoWars Restreams on the audio.
[03:58:37.685 --> 03:58:38.105]  God bless.

[03:58:47.802 --> 03:58:48.423]  Hello, friends.
[03:58:48.423 --> 03:58:49.484]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:58:49.484 --> 03:58:54.228]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:54.228 --> 03:58:57.190]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:58:57.190 --> 03:59:00.252]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:00.252 --> 03:59:06.077]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:06.297 --> 03:59:09.540]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:09.540 --> 03:59:16.545]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:16.545 --> 03:59:19.808]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
