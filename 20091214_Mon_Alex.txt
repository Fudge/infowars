[01:21.720 --> 01:30.280]  the good news here's the bad news Ron Paul who has seldom rung and his tracking lines up with
[01:30.280 --> 01:40.040]  the Hill Politico and the Financial Times of London Ron Paul of course Friday here said he
[01:40.040 --> 01:51.840]  believes the health care plan is going to pass but by a razor slim edge if the public goes
[01:51.840 --> 01:58.080]  absolutely a calling talk radio calling Congress going to your local senators meet and greets
[01:58.080 --> 02:04.520]  go to your senator's church and get in their face at the church meeting I mean this is not a game
[02:04.520 --> 02:11.360]  this is 17% of what's left of the economy being hijacked by these crooks and massive cuts to
[02:11.360 --> 02:20.880]  Medicare and Medicaid so all the money goes to the banks this is happening right now as Dennis
[02:20.880 --> 02:25.400]  Kucinich called it a giant bailout for the insurance companies it's not a bailout it's a
[02:25.400 --> 02:33.680]  loot out it's a robbery it's a pirate out the bankers are meeting again with Obama today staging
[02:33.680 --> 02:38.520]  events paying back tarp money they take the money they leverage it out more than 10 times per
[02:38.520 --> 02:45.320]  dollar with fractional reserve fiat derivatives manipulation when they pay back small portions
[02:45.320 --> 02:50.000]  of it they're only talking about the first 700 billion that doesn't even count federal reserve
[02:50.000 --> 02:57.400]  open window lending to themselves over 23.7 trillion again it's been four months we haven't
[02:57.400 --> 03:03.040]  gotten new numbers in four months it should be over 30 trillion if you follow the graph but we
[03:03.040 --> 03:12.560]  don't know 23.7 that's bad enough let me tell you who's on the radio show today Chuck Norris will

[08:23.360 --> 08:29.040]  to the government making us dependent on them that's happening as well right now
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.400]  they're breaking it all down with chuck norris you know i forgot he was good friends with steve
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.920]  mcqueen i'm a steve mcqueen fam maybe i'll ask him to tell us that bruce lee or steve mcqueen story

[08:57.760 --> 09:03.360]  exposing what's happening over in kopenhagen he wrote red hot lies how global warming alarmists
[09:03.360 --> 09:10.960]  use threats fraud and deception to keep you misinformed and uh then we also have dr niles axel
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.600]  mourner joining us he's over in kopenhagen breaking down the fraud taking place
[09:19.600 --> 09:25.280]  as we continue to track one of the most important conferences in modern history well the un says
[09:25.280 --> 09:29.760]  it's the most important and i agree with them if they're able to ram this through this is open
[09:29.760 --> 09:37.920]  establishment of total private unelected banking government i mean this we are actual profit of
[09:37.920 --> 09:46.480]  private bankers pretty much already by the way i have a ran corporation report here in front of me
[09:46.480 --> 09:57.680]  i saw this on the lrc blog by william greg and i actually read most of the 190 something page
[09:57.680 --> 10:04.960]  pdf this weekend and it was very painful to read it just confirms everything we already knew
[10:07.440 --> 10:14.880]  but the police are already being totally federalized the us army is going to operate
[10:14.880 --> 10:18.000]  through the pentagon a domestic military force called the
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.040]  like let me just read to you the actual um
[10:26.400 --> 10:32.800]  a stability police force for the united states justification and options for creating us capabilities
[10:33.920 --> 10:39.680]  and it says that a pentagon run police force will run all the local police departments
[10:39.680 --> 10:46.480]  actually says it now again they propose it years after it's already in place that's why
[10:46.480 --> 10:51.520]  they're putting pentagon liaisons in all the departments and cia liaisons in the threat fusion
[10:51.520 --> 10:59.600]  centers i mean this is so illegal so dangerous so unamerican this isn't a red flag this is a red
[10:59.600 --> 11:07.680]  volcano erupting i mean this is run for the hills bad this is worse than north korea worse than
[11:07.680 --> 11:14.240]  mexico worse than communist china i mean this is complete federal death squads
[11:19.600 --> 11:25.120]  and they state it's for the us collapsing see the bankers are going to collapse everything
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.000]  and a lot of people are only going to serve the government with that much more glee
[11:32.720 --> 11:33.600]  a lot of people
[11:33.600 --> 11:35.600]  will
[11:37.040 --> 11:42.960]  as the tyranny intensifies through cowardice will actually serve it and vitriolically praise it
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.920]  and convince themselves that they like it and that it's good
[11:49.600 --> 11:54.720]  while even at a conscious level knowing they're just cowards and they're scared to death of it
[11:54.720 --> 12:04.160]  it very few times in my life have i experienced just the edge of that psychological phenomenon
[12:04.720 --> 12:12.160]  and then recoiled from it from my very core of of of being a sentient human being
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.000]  but that's what george arwell talks about with crime stop and double think in 1984
[12:20.000 --> 12:28.320]  or how people instantly see corruption instantly see oppression instantly see hypocrisy and tyranny
[12:28.320 --> 12:34.800]  and degradation and then just spin it in their own minds that it's a good thing so they can feel
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.200]  like they're part of the system and have power over it because deep down they are so deathly afraid
[12:41.200 --> 12:55.440]  of it they think by laughing and smiling and and and and giggling and and and having kind of an
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.480]  arrogant haughty attitude that it gives them control over it
[13:00.480 --> 13:13.680]  just know this everything being set up by private fortune 100 corporations everything
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.760]  being set up by our criminal illegitimate government everything being set up by the un
[13:18.320 --> 13:25.680]  everything being pushed is a unified global agenda on record that is a 180 degrees the
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.760]  opposite of not just our bill of rights constitution declaration of independence but the magna cardab
[13:33.040 --> 13:38.640]  the geneva convention the 10 commandments i mean any moral yardstick
[13:40.960 --> 13:49.920]  by any angle whether it be sociological psychological from the angle of anthropology
[13:49.920 --> 13:56.720]  if we were a civilization 100 years in the future looking back on this time
[13:57.680 --> 14:03.520]  it would clearly be stated this was a time of just absolute propaganda mass drugging of the public
[14:04.400 --> 14:12.080]  brainwashing and tyranny going on in front of everyone just just outrageous crimes that the
[14:12.080 --> 14:17.440]  illegitimate global government practices and sets precedence to do whatever they want whenever they
[14:17.440 --> 14:20.640]  want however they want with the media culture
[14:23.120 --> 14:33.520]  marinating the public mind in torture and abuse and slavery and degradation and humiliation
[14:34.160 --> 14:43.360]  and tyranny and packaging it in a sicky sweet envelope of we're the good guys we're the good
[14:43.360 --> 14:59.840]  people we're saving the world and it's only going to get worse i mean we we have just begun the plunge
[14:59.840 --> 15:05.440]  we just went off the cliff when you hit the bottom when all of us hit the bottom
[15:05.440 --> 15:13.920]  in the years to come when we bounce on those rocks at the bottom it is not going to look good it
[15:13.920 --> 15:21.600]  is not going to feel good okay right now we're just falling off the side and a few of us are
[15:21.600 --> 15:27.680]  got our bloody fingernails into the side sliding down just hopefully trying to find some purchase
[15:27.680 --> 15:38.880]  hoping to find some place to grab hold and spiritually obese and decadent people
[15:38.880 --> 15:45.840]  are hanging off of our legs pulling on us screaming let go let go you're keeping us from heaven
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.840]  and so don't worry they're going to get what they want we're going to hit bomb
[15:51.840 --> 15:58.880]  and they're so brainwashed so drugged out so stupid so cowardly they've been brought through
[15:58.880 --> 16:06.080]  successive programs of intensifying corruption accepting corruption accepting lies that now
[16:06.080 --> 16:14.400]  they believe lies and evil are good and that good is bad and so many people are going to love the
[16:14.400 --> 16:24.080]  tyranny they're very childlike very doglike it's like taking an old dog out that's got cancer
[16:25.040 --> 16:28.400]  and you don't want to take it into the vet to have them put it down that way you know that
[16:28.400 --> 16:32.640]  actually scares them worse they can smell the death in there so you just walk them back on
[16:32.640 --> 16:39.840]  the back 40 you've already got their grave dug you pet them a little bit on the head and stick the
[16:39.840 --> 16:45.440]  243 rifle butt to the side of their face and smile at them and tell them you love them and
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.480]  pull the trigger but instead the new water doesn't love us it enjoys putting a bullet in our head
[16:50.480 --> 16:58.800]  but we're just like the dog though lovingly having no idea you ever watch the footage of the soviets
[16:58.800 --> 17:04.560]  and the nazis running people they were going to execute into shallow grave pits and they run one
[17:04.560 --> 17:10.640]  group of men in and they do the fleet bow to the soldiers as they run by submissively with
[17:10.640 --> 17:15.200]  their hat in their hand and and show them how how they run quickly and step over the dead bodies
[17:15.200 --> 17:19.360]  and and you know because all they want is the approval of the authority figure of the uniform
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.600]  they want the approval oh blow my head off oh you're wearing fancy black boots you've got
[17:27.600 --> 17:36.160]  little fancy fancy buttons on your caps like a king's crown blow my brains out i'm not gonna run by
[17:36.160 --> 17:41.680]  you and grab you by the throat and try to rip your nose off no i'm not gonna have any humanity to
[17:41.680 --> 17:49.600]  fight back i'm gonna run down into the pit and that's what america is you know you look at those
[17:49.600 --> 17:55.120]  people in europe and call them cowards no it's the peer pressure 90 percent of americans would run
[17:55.120 --> 18:00.160]  their children into pits to have their heads blown off and would thank the officers who did it
[18:02.320 --> 18:07.840]  because they worship it you want to live in a police state you do drive down the road half the
[18:07.840 --> 18:13.840]  billboards i see are government admonishments the governments the mommy the daddy it's bossing you
[18:13.840 --> 18:21.280]  spy on your neighbors don't abuse children do you don't smoke pot oh do you have a gun oh did you
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.680]  there's an old lady missing because the government it's the one that cares it's the one that tells
[18:25.680 --> 18:31.840]  you about the old lady missing just all the message that they're the good guys and you watch shows
[18:31.840 --> 18:38.400]  like cops everyone's a white trash scum everyone's got drool coming out of their mouth and missing
[18:38.400 --> 18:44.560]  teeth everyone's guilty and the cops are in fancy uniforms and all have their stuff together and the
[18:44.560 --> 18:49.920]  image is the public's all a bunch of scum and the police are god and only they will save us
[18:49.920 --> 18:56.080]  you know what happens in cultures where the police are worshiped you die you become slaves
[18:57.280 --> 19:02.960]  but you don't want to face that do you you just want to be throttled by government
[19:02.960 --> 19:08.560]  owned by big corporations and don't worry you are they're going to take everything you've got
[19:10.320 --> 19:13.760]  and they're going to take your sons and daughters minds they're going to come home and preach at
[19:13.760 --> 19:19.520]  you about the global government and the carbon tax and rebuke you over your firearms or rebuke
[19:19.520 --> 19:25.600]  you when you try to discipline them and they'll scream and beg to come home after the cps takes them
[19:26.320 --> 19:29.440]  but that won't matter because the news will never warn the other kids
[19:33.120 --> 19:41.120]  and it will go on and on and on being trampled on by tyrants but don't worry in this new system
[19:41.120 --> 19:44.800]  you're going to get to trample people though when you spy on your neighbors and tattle

[24:20.640 --> 24:30.960]  beard the year 2009 is very long in the tooth just like our lives are very very short but what
[24:30.960 --> 24:37.440]  do we leave for our children and the children to come i see myself as like a tree in a grove of
[24:37.440 --> 24:45.440]  trees i'm not really worried about myself i'm worried about the forest itself where all my
[24:45.440 --> 24:51.520]  ancestors have fallen down and become mulch that i grew from i think about all my progeny to come
[24:52.320 --> 25:01.680]  all the little acorns and i understand that my species my culture has been hijacked by an
[25:01.680 --> 25:09.840]  aberrant group of homo sapiens sapiens who have set up a predatory system over our own species
[25:13.040 --> 25:19.760]  and i know the classical hardcore vicious tyrannies being set up for the state of aim of
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.520]  establishing a planetary world government for the orderly execution and murder of the general
[25:25.520 --> 25:31.760]  population they're already drugging our water supplies and drugging the population to the food
[25:32.400 --> 25:40.240]  and through direct drugging and vaccines they're openly announcing their world one child policies
[25:41.600 --> 25:44.400]  through the new treaty that it is meant to shut off your resources
[25:47.200 --> 25:50.880]  they're openly announcing that they are going to federalize all police globally
[25:50.880 --> 25:58.320]  directly under the imf and world bank with paramilitary forces to wage war against the people
[25:59.760 --> 26:06.000]  they have declared open war and sedition against all that is good all that is wholesome and all
[26:06.000 --> 26:15.600]  that is legitimate but for the public all that matters is the uniform the signet the title of office
[26:15.600 --> 26:27.840]  just as the germans hitler is our furor he must be followed ein volk ein reich ein führer
[26:29.360 --> 26:39.440]  one people one land one leader but leaders come and go in this system the banking dictatorship
[26:39.440 --> 26:47.840]  and its social engineering grid built over the last century stays
[26:52.480 --> 27:01.760]  and woe to all of us who have been sleeping while the darkness grew woe to all of you
[27:01.760 --> 27:11.120]  that have been conditioned to accept evil and corruption not just in its hidden disguises
[27:12.080 --> 27:18.880]  not just in its cloaked forms but in its most classic open manifestations
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.640]  of the national police force clothed in black robed in black
[27:24.640 --> 27:37.360]  the citizen spy network killing the unborn preemptive wars of aggression for resources
[27:38.240 --> 27:41.680]  the mercenary forces now replacing our main military
[27:46.080 --> 27:53.760]  secret arrest rendition snatch and grab torture black site prisons all worshiped on the dramas
[27:53.760 --> 28:00.800]  where the soft fat-fingered americans can sit there and their lazy boys as the tyranny
[28:00.800 --> 28:08.560]  creeps in around them watching the superstar jack bower torture children to save la from the nuke

[28:57.840 --> 28:59.280]  but today it is done
[29:02.160 --> 29:09.760]  far more sophisticated fashion and more vicious and wanton way more openly clothed
[29:09.760 --> 29:18.640]  in the classical cloak of evil manifesting itself and roaring that it's gonna tear your
[29:18.640 --> 29:24.640]  guts out while you're alive that it's gonna draw and quarter you and eat you slow it's gonna use

[34:05.520 --> 34:13.680]  their manhood that is their male experience is watching some other men have a simulated battle
[34:13.680 --> 34:23.040]  on a field when a scientific tyranny has openly announced itself and its intent to kill you and
[34:23.040 --> 34:30.880]  your progeny to blot you out to genocide you to decide who can have children and who can't
[34:30.880 --> 34:39.520]  openly announcing its plans for you and following their announced program they're not idly boasting

[34:49.520 --> 34:58.720]  who's got one ounce of humanity to them what woman couldn't see tyranny coming a mile away
[34:58.720 --> 35:02.640]  now it's right on top of us stomping our guts out
[35:12.560 --> 35:19.360]  it's so unspeakable it's so much more horrible than i could even describe to you i mean ladies
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.040]  and gentlemen if you go to info wars dot com or prison planet dot com was also an article written
[35:25.040 --> 35:33.440]  at lou rockwell ran corporation blueprint for militarized stability police force i read the 180
[35:33.440 --> 35:40.720]  plus page well it's 132 pages and then it's got like a 60 page addendum i i read this thing and
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.360]  it's one thing to know all of this is going on it's another thing to see it all written out
[35:45.360 --> 35:54.640]  out by the government's own think tank in black and white i mean it's horrible
[35:55.520 --> 36:03.040]  i actually started crying last night reading over this i'd read part of it last week and i
[36:03.840 --> 36:10.640]  there's actually a few tears staining this paper because this is the most diabolical evil i mean
[36:10.640 --> 36:17.120]  it just openly says the pentagon will have a police force that runs everything and runs your
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.480]  local police department now again we already knew this was happening but to see it being done and
[36:22.480 --> 36:29.440]  openly announced this is high treason you have any idea how illegal this is yeah i guess you do have
[36:29.440 --> 36:35.760]  an idea how illegal it is to have the president saying he's going to sign a treaty and that if
[36:35.760 --> 36:41.600]  congress won't ratify it he'll just enforce it quote by command and control that's high treason
[36:41.600 --> 36:44.240]  right there that's a high crime as ron paul said last friday here
[36:47.280 --> 36:53.520]  they have set the precedent to do whatever they want whenever they want the government has black
[36:53.520 --> 37:00.400]  sites where they admittedly torture people and their families oh yes that's admitted and their
[37:00.400 --> 37:06.080]  families wantonimo is just the public camp there to sell you on how well they're treated the black
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.920]  sites all over europe and middle east in asia and then after they torture people for three four five
[37:11.920 --> 37:19.520]  six seven eight years in some cases they trot them out to confess i mean people knew immediately
[37:19.520 --> 37:26.080]  when our pilots confessed to all sorts of crimes they hadn't committed in the korean war and the
[37:26.080 --> 37:33.760]  vietnam war people knew every american knew that's ridiculous you don't believe anything when somebody
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.400]  has been tortured no in america we go yeah we torture them and then we have kangaroo trials
[37:38.400 --> 37:45.280]  and they're like that's right because we get tough you fools the patriot acts written for you section
[37:45.280 --> 37:50.320]  802 they now admit the whole thing was written for gun owners and conservatives you guys driving
[37:50.320 --> 37:56.000]  around with power of pride on your golf carts and on your houses and on your cars you know american
[37:56.000 --> 38:04.800]  flags let's nuke the a-rabs the muslim extremists are all funded by our own criminal government
[38:04.800 --> 38:14.480]  that's even coming out in mainstream news now in fact i have news clips about how they train
[38:14.480 --> 38:23.280]  the people to be al qaeda in the torture camps oh god help me because i want to just calm down
[38:23.280 --> 38:33.040]  and cover the news here it's just such a lie it's a multi trillion dollar a year defense system of
[38:33.040 --> 38:39.040]  course they go out and create a fund a few billion in fake enemies does that mean some person who
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.720]  grew up in a dirt village doesn't really believe they're fighting for a la when they run in and
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.080]  carry out a suicide bombing no but they are funded and handled up the chain right into the
[38:50.080 --> 38:54.400]  builder berg group right into the un right into the new world order period
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.800]  but let's say i mean what you've got a 14 times better chance in 2008 the latest numbers
[39:04.800 --> 39:11.440]  to be killed drowning in your bathtub than you do from a terror attack but you're ready to give up
[39:11.440 --> 39:16.560]  your whole life you're ready oh my gosh there's terrorists under every bench even if there were
[39:16.560 --> 39:21.920]  under every bench what happened to us or we heard our kids to the airports through body
[39:21.920 --> 39:26.800]  scanners that record their naked bodies for the government biometric system and and take our shoes
[39:26.800 --> 39:32.880]  off in an act of supplication and submission your kids are all trained to tattle on you and spy on
[39:32.880 --> 39:44.480]  you in the public schools i mean i could go on and on and on and on and on this isn't freedom
[39:44.480 --> 39:51.200]  this isn't goodness this isn't a wholesome country okay it's like if you go in your cupboard and a
[39:51.200 --> 39:57.440]  bag of wheat or rice has weevils all in it you got to throw it away you don't dump it in a boil
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.840]  in a bowl and pour hot water on it and give it to your two-year-old it's got weevils and
[40:03.840 --> 40:11.600]  weevil crap all in it it's rotten period the government is a criminal enterprise and knows
[40:11.600 --> 40:19.040]  it is knows it is and they've got mercenary police and mercenary military and mercenary
[40:19.040 --> 40:23.840]  politicians in both political parties and they think it's all a big joke
[40:27.200 --> 40:32.480]  there's plenty of social climbers and plenty of people in history that will sell out to anything
[40:32.480 --> 40:38.960]  and everything for the almighty dollar and status they're hyper competitive insecure people
[40:38.960 --> 40:44.480]  and all they care about is being on top it doesn't matter if it's on top of a pile of skulls
[40:46.080 --> 40:52.160]  now let me give you the good news developing countries boycott un climate talks because
[40:52.160 --> 40:56.480]  they've discovered they've got to make close to double the cuts that the west does and that the
[40:56.480 --> 41:02.080]  whole thing's a fraud that's associated press african nations walk out of Copenhagen talks
[41:02.080 --> 41:10.160]  discovering it was a eugenics operation later i want to when we go live on tv i want to go
[41:10.160 --> 41:14.320]  over the hockey stick scam to explain how they work they only show you a snapshot
[41:15.600 --> 41:21.840]  of the last few years of climate not the last few hundred to make it look like the climate's
[41:21.840 --> 41:28.160]  going up the temperatures going up we're going to be breaking that down also the un everywhere
[41:28.160 --> 41:36.400]  is at official press conferences with certified media not allowing them to ask about climate
[41:36.400 --> 41:43.280]  gate if you're asked at official un press conferences you are drug out by security guards
[41:44.640 --> 41:51.200]  with guns this is your tyranny also tony blair is trying to cash out on climate change
[41:51.760 --> 41:55.520]  former prime minister arrives at summit to urge greenhouse gas deal that will make him a bunch
[41:55.520 --> 42:03.440]  of money that's the daily mail winter weather increases dolphin turtle strandings this is out
[42:03.440 --> 42:09.200]  of the east coast of the united states out of main record cold air is killing dolphins and turtles
[42:13.840 --> 42:21.280]  canada freezes a snowstorm strands thousands in many cities it is the coldest temperatures ever
[42:21.280 --> 42:26.800]  recorded in this time of december people in the north the central part of canadian province of
[42:26.800 --> 42:34.800]  ontaria are digging out after one of the worst snowstorms on record abc news meanwhile the new
[42:34.800 --> 42:39.920]  york times is reporting bloom bird the big foot in carbon and they've done an analysis that he has
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.360]  one of the biggest carbon footprints if not the biggest of anyone on the world see these articles
[42:45.360 --> 42:52.160]  are a fraud this allows the establishment to convince you psychologically that carbon footprints
[42:52.160 --> 42:57.200]  are important by ridiculing rich and powerful people who are calling for carbon restrictions
[42:57.200 --> 43:02.480]  and one-child policies by showing how they're hypocrites so then you start cheering yes yes
[43:02.480 --> 43:08.560]  cut their carbon and they always propose a carbon tax on rich people first just to set the precedent
[43:08.560 --> 43:15.520]  on you and so that's how the scam works it's just basic psychology the television's there to make
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.760]  you feel important and powerful and the articles are meant to make you feel like you're a member
[43:19.760 --> 43:27.840]  of the establishment it is thoroughly disgusting they come up with tactics use car salesman never
[43:27.840 --> 43:35.920]  thought about now let me get to the bad news and i've asked poll watson to write an article about
[43:35.920 --> 43:46.480]  this so people know we're in dire straits as it stands as ron paul said here friday the health
[43:46.480 --> 43:51.680]  care bill is going to pass five years in prison quarter million dollar fine if you don't get insurance
[43:52.400 --> 43:58.640]  2.5 to 5 percent of your paycheck taken out off the top on top of the 10 percent being taken out
[43:58.640 --> 44:06.640]  for social security medicare medicaid and on top of the other taxes average tax bracket about 27% to
[44:06.640 --> 44:15.280]  30% so all total the feds want to take it up to about 40% for people in higher tax brackets 50
[44:19.120 --> 44:24.240]  and it brings government control into health care cuts medicare and medicaid because all that money's
[44:24.240 --> 44:30.080]  got to go to the bankers folks this is how it works at the end of the banker program you you're
[44:30.080 --> 44:36.400]  basically paying 85 taxes according to the oecd at the un that's one of the private holding companies
[44:36.400 --> 44:43.360]  that runs all this the organization the oecd of economic cooperative development
[44:46.640 --> 44:53.120]  so liberman resists medicare buy-in plan mark my words liberman's going to say they made the
[44:53.120 --> 45:00.240]  changes he wanted and sign on to it okay so we got to get another senator to say no and it could
[45:00.240 --> 45:06.160]  happen if they put in a lot of fraudulent electronic voting machines a lot of incumbent senators have
[45:06.160 --> 45:12.000]  so much money they've been promised by the media that they'll keep them in there regardless but
[45:13.120 --> 45:16.240]  we need to get the states to start blocking it saying they're not going to go along with it
[45:17.120 --> 45:22.240]  but that's happening health care reform draws near financial times of london
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.760]  says that it is going to be passed by early next year and that's not just the board saying
[45:27.760 --> 45:32.400]  resistance is futile i've looked at it ron paul's looked at it looks like they're going to get it done
[45:35.040 --> 45:44.000]  now next i want to shift to this um they can only have a fake leftist like obama come out
[45:44.000 --> 45:51.120]  and say i'm going to increase troops by 80 000 which he's now doing he put in 40 000
[45:51.120 --> 45:56.720]  now additional 30 to 35 000 just of us forces into afghanistan he said i will get our troops out of
[45:56.720 --> 46:04.880]  iraq immediately then it was 16 months 18 months 20 months 21 now they say 2024 first they said two
[46:04.880 --> 46:09.520]  years we're going to keep our troops in afghanistan now they're saying 2022 they're never leaving did
[46:09.520 --> 46:15.760]  they ever leave germany or korea no so see they got to have obama come out and have the fake right
[46:15.760 --> 46:21.280]  wings say oh he doesn't want to put more troops in he's a calming when he works for the big banks
[46:21.280 --> 46:30.880]  it's fake left right paradigm and then and then he increases the wars well it's the same thing with
[46:30.880 --> 46:39.360]  taxes see the reason i've known glenn beck to be an operative is at key points he follows key talking
[46:39.360 --> 46:46.880]  points we'll see your rnc talking point about ron paul being dangerous and tied to terrorist
[46:46.880 --> 46:53.520]  and you see glenn beck putting it out along with joe scarborough and you see him come out for the
[46:53.520 --> 46:57.360]  banker bailout plan at the key point then later say he was number four and we could play those
[46:57.360 --> 47:03.440]  clips here you've seen him just google glenn beck neo con not libertarian you can you can watch that
[47:03.440 --> 47:08.960]  video of him saying ron paul's dangerous and a kook and evil and he still says it on his radio show
[47:09.840 --> 47:16.640]  while having him on and you know ron's nicely smiling at him so keep your friends close enemies
[47:16.640 --> 47:21.760]  closer that's what they're doing with beck now you notice o'reilly came out in the last month
[47:21.760 --> 47:28.720]  so has went back and so has the dnc rnc ran corporation cfr they're going to give you a
[47:28.720 --> 47:35.920]  value added tax and a sales tax and that's part of the copenhagen that the the two percent off the
[47:35.920 --> 47:43.200]  top value added on the gdp this is a un treaty and so they're they're they're planning on even if
[47:43.840 --> 47:50.800]  the senate won't pass it obama says he's going to enforce it i mean this is dictatorship this is
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.000]  this is what it's like when they say oh let us spy on you without warrants oh let us torture some
[47:56.000 --> 48:00.960]  people all let us have checkpoints all come on you know let us train your kids to tattle on you
[48:00.960 --> 48:05.120]  oh it's not that bad yeah it was bad when hitler did it but not bad when we do it it was bad when
[48:05.120 --> 48:12.880]  mounted it but not bad when we do it here's the gainsville son mini cv at option is cured for
[48:12.880 --> 48:18.800]  runaway deficits house speaker nancy polosi proposes it now who else is proposing it
[48:18.800 --> 48:23.280]  simultaneously and then they go on in the video clip to talk about liberals not liking it
[48:23.280 --> 48:33.040]  the full video clips up on up on info wars dot com curtain on wrote a story about it
[48:33.680 --> 48:37.840]  beck o'reilly called for more taxation it's a seven-minute clip i'm not going to play the whole
[48:37.840 --> 48:43.120]  thing later in the show if i have time i will check norris is coming up but listen to this because
[48:43.680 --> 48:47.040]  because then they go to talk about liberals want to stop it see now you could say
[48:47.040 --> 48:53.680]  um we need to vote the latimer linen in as the new president because the liberals don't
[48:53.680 --> 48:58.960]  want him and then conservatives go well i like linen then it's just like they had
[48:58.960 --> 49:03.840]  george bush say he was against carbon taxes so all the europeans got behind it when it was unpopular
[49:03.840 --> 49:11.280]  there see see how they manipulate you at a five-year-old level i mean you're more sophisticated
[49:11.280 --> 49:16.160]  than that now this is why i don't like blend back and folks i never watch him i literally
[49:16.160 --> 49:19.840]  watch clips once a week i can't stand looking at his disingenuous butt
[49:20.960 --> 49:25.440]  oh he'll tell you about good stuff until the key uh here he is with o'reilly calling for global
[49:25.440 --> 49:29.360]  taxes we'll come back and finish it but here's the first part of it thanks for your witness and bill
[49:29.360 --> 49:34.720]  o'reilly and the at your beck and call segment tonight a shocking development foxes commentator
[49:34.720 --> 49:40.720]  glenn beck chosen by barbara walters as one of the most fascinating people of 2009 we are not
[49:40.720 --> 49:46.320]  kidding with us mr fascination himself blend back before that before we're not fascinating
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.720]  before we're not fascinating with me about me we'll get to that in a moment and it's a travesty
[49:50.720 --> 49:56.640]  of a mockery of a sham as well it shows how well troubled television is but i i want to ask a serious
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.320]  question last night i know you watch the factor every night yes so you can steal material oh my
[50:00.320 --> 50:07.040]  god um and i said that economically we can bring the country back but you have to do some discipline
[50:07.040 --> 50:12.720]  you have to free spending yep you have to have a national sales tax yep percent what did you think
[50:12.720 --> 50:18.880]  about that um i actually i made some notes excellent i actually agree with you except i believe it
[50:18.880 --> 50:24.400]  should be a vat tax two percent vat value added no more no more than two percent what's the difference
[50:24.400 --> 50:31.920]  between a sales tax and a value added tax goes through you're gonna get both of them and you're
[50:31.920 --> 50:37.840]  gonna get by the mile taxes and you notice they use words like discipline stuff that manipulates
[50:37.840 --> 50:45.520]  conservatives i kind of like it though all these fake republicans that love the wars and love
[50:45.520 --> 50:51.040]  destroying countries you're gonna get hurt bad so in a way you're gonna get judged

[54:12.800 --> 54:16.960]  you heard only for the national debt gotta make sure it only goes to the private banks that
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.560]  created the money out of nothing and then you pay a loan sharking interest to you didn't know that
[54:22.560 --> 54:29.040]  the tarp money they were given was loaned back to the government oh what a what a tangled web
[54:29.040 --> 54:34.400]  they weave that they're saying oh if you support the troops you've got to have a global tax
[54:35.680 --> 54:42.400]  and you know to give them more benefits as if they'll ever see any of it and oh we you know
[54:42.400 --> 54:48.320]  we need to tighten our belt i don't have time to play this whole clip but see now it's liberal if
[54:48.320 --> 54:53.680]  you don't want more taxes and see it's also liberal when obama cuts medicare and medicaid
[54:53.680 --> 54:59.680]  in the new health care bill they get more tax money literally trillions over the next decade
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.040]  but you get hundreds of billions less a year or right at 100 billion with 41 billion out of
[55:05.040 --> 55:11.360]  medicare 30 something billion out of medicaid a bunch of other cuts they cut see because the
[55:11.360 --> 55:16.000]  bankers are done they already got you addicted to handouts now it's time to butcher the christmas

[55:28.320 --> 55:36.720]  to el hefe let's hear that from beck the guy we can trust who was for tarp and for the patriot act
[55:36.720 --> 55:40.480]  and against ron paul here it is but you have to do some discipline you have to free spending
[55:40.480 --> 55:46.560]  yep you have to have a national sales tax yep percent what did you think about that um i actually
[55:47.760 --> 55:52.640]  i made some notes excellent i actually agree with you except i believe it should be a vat tax
[55:52.640 --> 55:57.520]  two percent vat value added no more no more than two percent what's the difference between a sales
[55:57.520 --> 56:02.960]  tax and a value of tax oh that's exactly what the treaty says goes through absolutely not again
[56:02.960 --> 56:07.440]  us americans ready for the treaty on every piece you make a car somebody's making the radio two
[56:07.440 --> 56:13.200]  percent somebody's making the so it it'll be great for the economy it is too all the way along the

[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:50.320]  kopenhagen denmark several of reporters want a reporter want a scientist to be breaking down the
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:56.720]  fraud of man-made global warming obviously not just the climate gate emails where the head
[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.760]  u and scientists are engaged in premeditated fraud covering up the decline of temperatures in the
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:08.880]  last nine years temperatures stopped heating up 15 years ago started dropping nine years ago
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:14.880]  we'll be covering that coming up in the next hour we're also going to get into the fact that
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:20.720]  ron paul said here last friday that he believes the obama takeover of health care to make even
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:27.040]  more americans dependent on the government a quarter million dollar fines five years in prison if
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:34.960]  you don't get insurance he believes as it stands it will pass but by one vote so we better put pressure
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:41.040]  on lieberman and let him know that if he doesn't vote against this somehow the whole nation is
[1:01:41.040 --> 1:01:47.520]  going to target him to not be reelected but for the next 30 minutes we are joined by chuck norris
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:53.920]  he really doesn't need any introduction though i will give him one here today he's a martial arts
[1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:58.320]  expert probably the most famous martial arts person in the world joined the air force after

[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:13.600]  celebrities as steve mcqueen who later encouraged norris into his acting career and then it goes

[1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:54.320]  but i'm very excited about that second book i love the last one the black belt patriotism now
[1:14:54.320 --> 1:14:59.200]  now chuck moving quick here uh specifically government run health care they want us to be
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:05.040]  dependent medicare medicaid cuts 41 billion out of medicare alone but they're going to put more
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:11.120]  people in medicare uh and it looks like it's going to pass ron paul was on this friday
[1:15:11.120 --> 1:15:16.320]  he said unfortunately looks like looks like it's probably going to pass well let it pass and then
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:20.560]  believe me everyone that puts their mark on that uh on that health care bill
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.520]  we've got to get them out of office next year you know that's got to be that's going to be my
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:30.240]  campaign you know i you know i write weekly articles for world aid daily and i'm going to be
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:34.320]  cameraing these guys i'm going to be going after each and every one of them that pass this health
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:40.240]  care bill just think about this alec you know let's let's fix what is broken okay 20 of the health
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:47.760]  care bill they're broken believe the 80 alone you know 80 of the people are happy with their health
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:54.400]  care you know i'm happy with mine so let's work on the 20 that isn't working you know rather than
[1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:59.360]  tearing it down it reminds me like if you have a you know you have a flat on your car right
[1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:04.720]  but you but you decide to change all the tires and maybe put in a new motor whether you need it or
[1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:08.880]  not see i believe that's what the government's thinking here well worse than that they're going
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:14.480]  to take the motor out and fire machine gun bullets and took as it has a flat exactly you know and the
[1:16:14.480 --> 1:16:19.520]  thing is you know it's not going to work it's not going to work and there's going to be a lot of
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:24.160]  hurting people because of this and that's where my heart goes out my heart goes out to the people
[1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:29.280]  that uh you know that that that are going to be suffering from this we're also as you were saying
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.400]  to me during the break we're also bankrupt and it is in there to give the illegals health care
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:39.280]  i mean we can't take 20 30 million people and give them free health care i mean we're going
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:45.520]  bankrupt now absolutely you know and the thing is i think the biggest mistake government made
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:53.440]  is using all this stimulus money to uh shore up a i g fanny may fray max banks cars all this up here
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:58.080]  they should have been using all that stimulus money to shore up small business so they you know
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:04.560]  so they can begin hiring back their employees you know our country as well survives on 80% of small
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:10.880]  business yes you know 80% of our company and well so why in the world aren't isn't the government
[1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:15.440]  you know of course obama's talking about it now a year later well i've got to help small business
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:20.960]  why didn't he start that you know months and months ago if he had well let me throw this out at
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:26.800]  your chuck norris right now sorry to interrupt we just have limited time if ron paul runs for
[1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:30.240]  president in the next year and a half are are are you going to support him are you thinking
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:36.240]  about supporting him uh i i love ron paul but i have to be honest with you i would like to have
[1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:42.880]  a younger uh president you know when you get in your 70s you know and i'm pushing 70 you know
[1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:49.440]  it's a it's a tough grind i would rather find someone's uh like ron paul who uh can relate our
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:54.480]  country not really i'm still a my cocky fan i really still believe that my cocky is the man
[1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:59.200]  to uh lead our country and then actually that's kind of the general consensus of the people in
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:05.600]  america and i would love to have ron paul you know in a very prominent position in washington
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:10.720]  but but what kind of position like treasury secretary yeah something like that something
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:17.200]  because he's not a spaniel uh here's one of my favorite uh fact also is america's not a democracy
[1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:24.400]  it's a chuck tatership and and now if that were true alex i would go to washington i would line up
[1:18:24.400 --> 1:18:30.800]  every member of congress and i'd have uh i'd have ron paul who i think is the more most honest
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:37.440]  politician in congress i'd say ron point out the honest and the dishonest uh politician
[1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:43.840]  and we'd go down the aisle ron say he's honest he's honest uh this one's dishonest i'd walk up to
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:49.520]  that person and i'd say you're fired and if he didn't move immediately i took him unconscious and
[1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:55.680]  dragging chuck norris is our guest chuck shifting out of health care obviously i agree with you
[1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:01.120]  it's very unpopular in the polls it's unconstitutional the federal government's not
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:07.280]  supposed to be involved in health care uh and we need to have recalls of these people and we need
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:12.480]  to repeal it if they do pass it oh yeah absolutely that's you know the thing is it's going to be a
[1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:19.680]  very uh trying three more years with the obama administration i can you know this is just the
[1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:24.720]  tip of the iceberg with the health care this is just the beginning if they pass this then they're
[1:19:24.720 --> 1:19:32.000]  going to go to embolden them to pass a lot of other very devastating bills such as cap and trade
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:37.680]  and a lot of the other things that's going to really negatively affect our country chuck norris
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:45.360]  since you brought that up uh i have the headline here epa threatens command and control economy to
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:50.640]  push climate change agenda and that was an associated press another headline was obama
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:55.760]  threatens command and control he's saying if the senate doesn't ratify kopenhagen which openly
[1:19:55.760 --> 1:20:02.080]  establishes global government according to the head of the un bankai moon then he will order
[1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:09.840]  the bureaucracy to supersede congress that is a high crime ron paul said last friday that clearly
[1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:17.680]  is an impeachable offense if obama does implement kopenhagen without congressional approval what
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:22.560]  do you think should be done i think then the congress should impeach obama you know they
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:28.960]  have the right to you know they can impeach him this is not an obama dictatorship is it no it
[1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:33.760]  isn't and and that but if that's what he really wants you know the thing he's not concerned about
[1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:40.880]  uh 2012 by 2012 he wants to be able to uh be a lifetime member of uh the presidency
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:45.360]  absolutely or have us in an emergency so bad that it's like
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:49.360]  roosevelt he just stays on well that's what that's what they're doing you know i know their
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:55.600]  game plan it's all a con game they're just trying to make our country so dependent on government
[1:20:55.600 --> 1:21:01.360]  that he can do he can do whatever he wants to do to uh to our country i i can see that see
[1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:08.640]  what he's doing here and uh and if we the people don't stand up and say enough is enough and we're
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:14.560]  going to vote you know well you would say like to say congress is now uh you know uh impotent uh
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:21.840]  you know that uh obama and his dars are the ones uh and uh ron emmanuel and and uh george
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:28.400]  soros the other one running our country and it's a sad it's a sad situation right now that's
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:33.200]  what's incredible george soros will go before congress and badmouth the banks when he is the
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:38.720]  biggest one involved in 1999 lobbying to get clinton to change the rules and it's his crew
[1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:43.200]  in there running the show right now what believe me you know but that's why they want a one girl
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:48.640]  world government because they want a one world bank and george soros will be running that one
[1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:53.280]  world bank that's what if that's his bill chuck norris is our guest we've got about 10 minutes
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:58.560]  left with him i want to play you two short clips this is herman von rompuy the new head of the e u
[1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:04.080]  calling for global government on bbc next is al gore here is von rompy our country's
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:11.440]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the g20 in the middle
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:18.560]  of the financial crisis the climate conference in copenhagen is another step towards the
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:23.600]  global management of our planet okay global government global management next clip chuck and
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:28.480]  i want your take on both of these this is al gore calling for global governance around the
[1:22:28.480 --> 1:22:32.000]  environment they're admitting this is their system for planetary government here it is
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:42.400]  but it is the awareness itself that will drive the change and one of the ways it will drive the
[1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:48.320]  change is through global governance and okay agreements global governance yeah well the thing
[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:57.840]  is right now al gore has become a multi-zillionaire because of this con game about global warming
[1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:02.720]  you know the thing is you know the other side of my ranch right now i'm freezing to death right
[1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:11.120]  it sure isn't warm right now here at the ranch but the thing is it's just a i think it's a global
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:18.640]  con game that al gore has uh has initiated you know and i'm sure he's used uh you know he's
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:23.120]  probably in cahoots with the george soros and a lot of those people with the power and the money
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:28.800]  and it's made him uh you know probably a billionaire by now and you know thing is but
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:34.480]  billions not enough yet uh you know once they get a little they want a lot and then they want it all
[1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:40.480]  and that's what al gore george soros uh rock obama that's what they want they want total
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:46.400]  control over the world and especially on the united states of america and it's heading in
[1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:50.960]  that direction alex believe me it's heading in that direction and if we don't do something about it
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:55.360]  that people don't rise up we're going to have a revolution in our country because once the government
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:24:01.440]  comes in and starts telling dictating us how we can raise our children putting putting us in jail
[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:09.600]  if we don't send our kids to school to learn what homosexuality is all about and how to use
[1:24:09.600 --> 1:24:16.240]  condoms properly uh they're going to put you in jail well chuck in in in 2000 i covered fiscate
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:23.600]  when it first broke that they were taking 14 year olds to a dorm with beds and and and i had
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:29.440]  stations got got angry when i played the audio tapes this person is now the schools are teaching
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:34.640]  14 year olds even if it was heterosexual it's pedophilia it doesn't matter what heterosexual
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:40.720]  homosexual the thing is that's too young to be a young why are they allowed to engage basically
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:49.120]  in pedophilia oh golly i don't know why they are you know i mean it's sickening it's absolutely
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:55.280]  sickening and then that's what they want they want a free society where anything goes i mean
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:25:01.120]  george soros he loves that he wants a free society in our country and uh and i really believe he's
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:05.840]  the power behind it all and i really believe that that's the direction they're going is having
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:12.080]  america as a free society and uh and you and uh you know that you can do pedophilia you can do
[1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:18.320]  whatever you want is which will be okay it's not going to be a crime about well yeah nambla is a
[1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:22.880]  official part of the un they're a non-governmental organization that's the north american manboy
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:28.480]  love association you know i don't hate any of you know groups out there for their sexual preference
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:33.920]  whatever but i do hate nambla i do hate nambla going after children sorry to know i have a lot
[1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:40.800]  of friends that are uh and homosexuals and gays and uh and that's not the concern of mine if that's
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:45.920]  their lifestyle fine but going after people's kids yeah going after people's kids that's uh that's
[1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:52.480]  a whole different animal and uh god forbidding whenever to come after my children uh i would uh
[1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:57.520]  i would spend the rest of my life in jail because i would uh i would pulverize them chuck norris you
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:02.720]  and any good parent would you brought up during the break what you're really upset about i i said
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:07.600]  what's most concerning you talked about california is trying to pass laws restrict homeschooling
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:13.360]  germany arrest you if you won't send your children to their indoctrination yeah they've
[1:26:13.360 --> 1:26:17.600]  actually pulled children out of homeschool they they're uh trying to keep you from having homeschool
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:23.680]  there in germany and i've read by blogs where parents have gone to jail because they would not
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:30.320]  let their kids go to a public school and learn about you know the homosexuality and and and free
[1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:36.320]  and free sex you know and how you know how to do it i mean what's a world coming to you know i thought
[1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:44.400]  uh it's so depressing you know to see the decadence that's going on not only in our country but all
[1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:49.840]  over the world but whatever happened to innocence just leaving kids alone to have a good time and
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:55.040]  not turn them into adults or not turn them into perverts look at this 12 years of age guys punch
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:58.800]  you up morris strong i want people to see that quote you talked about how they want to destroy
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:03.680]  our society morris strong the head of the u n environment program involved with the oil for
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:08.960]  food program he he's he's he's now been indicted he's in trouble he said isn't the only hope for
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:14.000]  the planet that the industrial civilizations collapse isn't in our responsibility to bring
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:21.280]  that about he said that in 92 at the u n he said carbon taxes are to destroy the economy they want
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:25.920]  to bankrupt the economy and make us dependent on them and that's everything you're fighting against
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:30.480]  chuck and that's what's so exciting that's what they want to do here they want to bankrupt our
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:35.600]  economy here in the united states and then come up with a universal coin uh universal money
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:41.360]  international money and uh and take away the the dollar we have here in america and and everyone
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:46.880]  use the international currency and i you know and i see that just like north korea no north korea
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:51.040]  just implemented uh you're changing the currency there well that's what's going to happen uh
[1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:56.000]  universally if we don't do something about it chuck and the in closing let me ask you this
[1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:01.360]  i've had a lot of national media here the last week and i play them clips of the head of the
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:06.320]  e u head of the u n calling for global government al gore i give them the treaty the kopenhagen
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:11.680]  treaty that states global government a two percent tax on everything which they're now promoting
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:17.760]  policy and others are a you know all these other taxes and they they tell me it doesn't exist
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:23.440]  that's a mind game isn't it where they just all a mind game alex it's all a mind game
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:28.080]  you know they're saying well we want to help the poor country we have poor people in our own country
[1:28:28.080 --> 1:28:33.360]  you know a lot of our kids are intercity kids you know that they they they won't have a Christmas
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:39.600]  this year because they have no money and the thing is why are we helping the poor in our own
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:45.440]  country and helping them uh uh be able to enjoy the luxuries of uh of what we have in this country
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:50.960]  this is what your case the academy is all the money we send overseas trying to help them out
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:55.680]  and they don't even appreciate it let's give it to the people in our own well i agree chuck norris
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:01.760]  but alex but but chuck it's worse the eugenicists the white house science are they say the carbon
[1:29:01.760 --> 1:29:07.120]  taxes are about starving the third world these carbon cuts in the treaty will just kill millions
[1:29:07.120 --> 1:29:14.720]  of starvation a year conservatively yeah yeah well you know i just i believe charity begins at home
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:22.240]  and and i you know and i just i just hope the people see what is going on and uh and just not
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:27.440]  sit home and say well whatever happens what it will happen uh if you know it's not it's not the way
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:33.040]  it should be you know and uh i'm i'm very concerned about it you know uh you know it's the most like
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:38.960]  uh if you do it i'll do it no you do it first and then i'll do it you know it's like nobody
[1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:44.640]  everybody wants that no one will step up unless there's someone else that but i really believe
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:49.920]  i really believe that we the uh united states have to start leading as an example we do we do

[1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:40.160]  lives and it's so important all the great things chuck chuck norris is doing okay chuck finishing
[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:46.400]  up with that point you got cut off obama you talk about him wanting a dictatorship clearly
[1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:51.520]  they are setting one up clearly he's setting up a domestic police force he's called for
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:58.720]  you talk about revolution how do we get the people to stand up and say no so it doesn't get to that
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:04.560]  point well the thing is right now leadership in our country is very scarce you know i think uh
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:12.080]  uh uh two leaders that i i uh look up to is ron paul and mike huckabee you know and mike huckabee
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:17.840]  has a voice now and on fox and uh and it's really showing because the polls are saying that he is by
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:25.040]  far the leading candidate for uh the republican ticket in 2012 i really think you know being
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:31.200]  with my mike huckabee for five months campaigning for him i saw him as a man of integrity and honesty
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:37.520]  and really a very intelligent man and he uh you know he went on that tour he never had a teleprompter
[1:34:37.520 --> 1:34:43.120]  he never had no he never had anything he talked right from his heart alex and that was very
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:47.840]  impressive i saw the media confronting him with that made-up thing about that nut that the parole
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:53.520]  board said let out and he was just so slick talking yeah the thing is i mean if he explained that was
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:35:00.160]  10 years ago uh the kid was 16 years old and all he committed was burglary you know he didn't he
[1:35:00.160 --> 1:35:04.640]  didn't assault anyone he didn't kill anyone it was strictly a burglary well it does show the
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:08.800]  media is scared of huckabee that's why they're scared of him they're scared of him and uh you
[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:13.040]  know but he does the guy did fall between the cracks because those judges in washington
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:18.800]  let him out after he'd committed those heinous crimes and that was where the the failure was
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:22.800]  in washington well chuck we're gonna let you go because i know you've got a newspaper interview
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:27.440]  coming up but on the subject of huckabee he has been coming out now and talking about the new world
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:32.640]  order he said it's a bad thing and i think it's becoming more acceptable now to tell the truth
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:38.160]  about the un and the globalist in george soros thanks to you and others speaking out but i have
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:42.560]  no doubt that we're going to defeat the new world order uh having chuck norris on our side well
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:47.200]  we're going to survive three more years alex and then we're going to have my cuckabee as president
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:52.640]  and uh and ron paul as secretary of the treasury and that way we'll keep things honest in our country
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:57.920]  thank you so much uh chuck norris for joining us we'll talk to you next year okay buddy bye bye
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:03.440]  god bless okay there goes chuck norris take care sir well that was a fun interview with
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:12.320]  chuck norris uh what about a huckabee ron paul ticket look a huckabee's not perfect but compared
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:20.240]  to compared to george bush and uh barack obama my gosh anything's good it oh my gosh you know
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:28.720]  i'm just glad that chuck norris is uh is going around speaking out against the new world order
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:35.440]  he's going on national tv and when shan hannity said oh well ron paul's a cook ron paul's a nut
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:40.880]  and he said well good i'm a nut too i like him you know he didn't betray him he didn't uh wasn't
[1:36:40.880 --> 1:36:47.920]  a doubting thomas he didn't um throw ron paul into the bus and uh chuck norris has come a long
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:55.200]  way waking up with the new world order just like jesse ventura has come a long way you know talking
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:01.040]  to chuck norris he talked about how over 10 years ago he heard my show and liked it in texas and
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.640]  chuck knows a lot more than he's letting on i'll tell you that so he's certainly coming along
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:13.120]  not just in his knowledge but what he's willing to talk about but he certainly does like mike huckabee
[1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:20.960]  so that was an interesting interview with him you know i was about to ask him about glenn
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:29.040]  beck who he goes on a show and is friendly with glenn beck calling for a value added tax
[1:37:30.880 --> 1:37:36.000]  glenn beck calling for a value added tax that's exactly what the copenhagen global
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.320]  government treaty that will be paid directly to the imf and world bank we now have the treaty
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:48.240]  it's on record associated press london guardian that i am f world bank will run the treaty
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:55.040]  and so developing countries boycott un climate talks because the un is to lose its power the
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:37:59.600]  un never had the power was always a front for banks it was a debating society to get all
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.920]  the third world countries together so they could be bought off and paid off guys will you pull up
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:18.720]  again the clip of bill o'reilly slash glenn beck friday night this is bill o'reilly
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:25.440]  and glenn beck talking about how they want national sales taxes and value added taxes
[1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:28.800]  how over a decade i've told you because i read the official government plans
[1:38:28.800 --> 1:38:35.040]  so council on foreign relations publications you're going to have a national sales tax that
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:41.520]  is graduated so it's fair some will be exempt but there's going to be fraud with people buying
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:46.400]  black market so you're going to thumb print and swipe a card to buy and sell that will also
[1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:51.600]  be your carbon tax credit i've told you that for more than a decade because i'm reading directly
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:39:00.640]  from the the cfr and ran corporation and others plants i haven't forgotten more than i know
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:06.000]  forgotten more than most people know it's that i've i read this ran corporation plan about
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:12.960]  federalizing all police and putting federal death squads on the streets and 10 years from now it
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:18.320]  will just be knowledge that i have and i'll have to reach back into my memory to even remember where
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:26.800]  i got it but they write about what's already been covertly set up here but the issue here is
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:31.920]  people ask why i don't like glenn beck because the establishment is keeping their friends
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:37.520]  close their enemies closer at key points beck attacks ron paul at key points he says there
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:42.480]  are no fema camps at key points he says the mayak homeland security reports saying veterans and gun
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:49.920]  owners are terrorist might be reasonable at key points he gets your confidence and then he sabotages
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:40:00.800]  and when i saw nancy polosi last week many see vat option as cure for runaway deficits giving
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:06.320]  a close shot of this please this is the gainsville sun and you can look up all these other republicans
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:13.760]  and democrats saying oh yes the way to get us out of this deficit is more taxes no the average
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:19.200]  federal employees money's gone up the government tripled under bush has more than tripled in the
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:25.600]  first year under obama that's they want to destroy the economy as chuck norris just said i have their
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:31.440]  own documents i just read to you what morris strong said but here's nancy polosi calling for it now
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:35.200]  in this seven-minute clip i don't have time to play the whole thing you can go watch it at info
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:40.400]  wars dot com if you want and the article curt nemo wrote beck o'reilly called for more taxation
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:47.920]  they start talking about oh the liberals don't like you oh i'm proposing taxes oh i wonder why
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:53.520]  the liberals had you on abc and it's all about the celebrity of beck and how much these two ego
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:41:03.600]  maniacs on tv together and i just can't understand how they completely sell their souls out for money
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:08.880]  and power there's nothing wrong with money and power if you got it through do tell them the
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:14.880]  truth doing the right thing and not being an evil person but it's not what you're supposed to worship
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:21.120]  and do anything for i mean glenn beck and o'reilly with the words they use and the terms they use and
[1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:26.880]  about tightening our belts and discipline discipline is giving the government more taxes
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:33.120]  officially setting up a federal and value added tax over everything federal inspectors in more of
[1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:41.680]  your lives two more irs's and then i said last week i said watch you're gonna watch value added
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:48.800]  and sales taxes proposed during a financial crisis in the next year and because i read it in the
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:55.760]  treaty what you read in a un treaty is what happens jack even if the senate doesn't ratify it
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:02.240]  by fiat they will pass all the tax laws to get in line with it all the laws piecemeal to get
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:09.120]  like an erector set or legos they will put it all together in pieces and what is in the treaty
[1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:15.920]  a value added tax of two percent what did lord mocton tell you last week what did i read
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:25.680]  out of the treaty here on air here it is here's the treaty what does it have a two percent flat
[1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:32.400]  tax on our on all air travel a 30 tax on all coal a two percent value added right off the top of the
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:38.960]  gdp it's all in the framework convention on climate change which is a convention like the
[1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:42.720]  continental convention like that like like like like the constitution
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:48.560]  that this is their global government total takeover they've built the platform they've
[1:42:48.560 --> 1:42:53.280]  got the rocket fueled they're launching the rocket they're launching the new world order right now
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:58.640]  now the greatest time to ever be alive folks because these people are eugenicists they want
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:03.440]  to cut your resources off so they can socially engineer you and take your kids chuck norris
[1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:07.920]  has finally gotten it completely understands it's about taking your kids it's about the state
[1:43:07.920 --> 1:43:13.680]  ending the family folks the illuminati during the french revolution this is on record tried to go
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:20.640]  to a 10 day work week 10 days out of the week well what was it like nine months out of the year
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:27.360]  they tried to abolish the family it failed china tried that these people are the same group ladies
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:35.200]  and gentlemen it's real you better wake up they mean business you expect me to talk no mr bond i
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:42.480]  expect you to die they want you dead you understand that they want your family broken up that's why
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:47.680]  they give men ridiculous expectations women ridiculous expectations everybody thinks they're
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:53.520]  supposed to be a movie star everybody feels inadequate because they never became movie stars
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:59.360]  madison avenue first makes you feel weak and insecure that they can sell you with what will
[1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:05.280]  supposedly fulfill you when the truth is i've been in big movies with big movie stars the truth is
[1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:09.680]  i've hung out with people you wouldn't believe the truth is i've seen things you wouldn't believe
[1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:15.680]  the truth is because i took action against the new world order and most people are too timid to do it
[1:44:15.680 --> 1:44:21.040]  it's taken me to very high mountains i've been taken up to the mountain and offered great power by
[1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:27.920]  the system but because i was offered the great power i realized it was crap it meant nothing it
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:34.240]  means nothing money means something if your car isn't running and you can't feed your family it's
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:38.640]  very important up to that point once you're comfortable let me tell everybody out there
[1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:44.240]  the yuppies who think they need more more more that they'd be fulfilled if they had the newest
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:49.920]  ipod or if they had the newest car it means nothing what matters is that you're an honorable person
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:54.480]  and that you help other people and that you understand you're part of the species and part
[1:44:54.480 --> 1:45:01.440]  of a continuum and that there's evil that has to be faced that's what will fulfill you you're not
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:07.600]  fulfilled because you aren't tuned into reality your subconscious mind is hundreds of times more
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:14.880]  powerful than your conscious mind your subconscious mind knows everything that's going on everyone is
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:21.760]  a genius but they can't focus it through their conscious lens hundreds of times stronger you
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:27.040]  don't have access to that you haven't trained yourself to have access to discernment to understanding
[1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:32.080]  and so your subconscious mind is telling you i'm not happy i don't like this you may be in a five
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:36.880]  million dollar mansion you may have the hottest 25 year old trophy wife prancing in on her high
[1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:42.960]  hills shoes you're not happy you know why you're not happy why isn't tiger woods happy why aren't all
[1:45:42.960 --> 1:45:48.240]  these sports people and movie stars not happy because they're not truly serving humanity now
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:53.280]  the globalists know how to create counterfeits of serving for the carbon tax let's help the third
[1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:58.080]  world with all the well-meaning hippies when it's actually meant to kill the third world of course
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:05.120]  you hide killing the third world starving them out under siege by saying your that that that's
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:09.920]  warfare the opposite of what it really is you're killing them you say you're saving them to get
[1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:17.360]  all the well-meaning people to serve them and that's the true essence of evil is getting good
[1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:26.960]  to serve you get sophisticated get serious i've said enough i'm ranting just listen i don't hate
[1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:34.720]  glenbeck when i assess him he looks like a completely mentally ill person he looks completely
[1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:43.040]  screwed up his eyes he looks completely weak completely powerless very effeminate but not

[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.640]  going to bait and switch during an economic crisis and give you those taxes on top of the
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:32.160]  income tax and it's going to be a national carbon tax and it's going to track everywhere you go and
[1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:43.440]  what you do shut up communist i like being conned and now oh your two icons bill o riley bill o and
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:53.040]  glenn b baby b he's up there he's going to save you and then they go into how the liberals are
[1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:58.400]  attacking them see let me tell you how you're conservative you have raised taxes absolutely
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:03.600]  that's incredibly conservative glenn now we shouldn't cut the government that's doubling or more every
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:11.120]  year yeah no let's just raise taxes well of course they are that's their job is to be absurd
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:17.920]  glenn beck is meant to come off disingenuous and slimy to everyone out there to demonize the
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:25.440]  patriot movement again with patriots like glenn beck who needs malatang with libertarians like
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:32.080]  glenn beck who needs joseph stalin let's go ahead and go back to beck and o'reilly just two of the
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:37.360]  slimiest fake pundits out there together here they are factor every night yes so you can steal
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:44.400]  material oh my god um and i said that economically we can bring the country back but you have to do
[1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:50.320]  some discipline you have to free spending yep you have to have a national sales tax yeah what did
[1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:56.320]  you think about that um i actually i made some notes excellent i actually agree with you except
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:02.240]  i believe it should be a vat tax 2% vat value added no more no more than 2% what's the difference
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:07.600]  between a sales tax and a value a value add tax goes through or value added tax goes through
[1:56:07.600 --> 1:56:13.280]  absolutely everything so it hits 2% on every piece you make a car somebody's making the radio 2%
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:19.440]  somebody's making that so it hits the corporations it is all the way along the line do you remember
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:24.800]  that corporation's money will always pass it on to the folks which is why i like the sales tax better
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:30.960]  well hang on just a second but if you have a 2% vat um you can um pay things down awfully darn
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:37.280]  quickly that's what i want is a what i want is this is the part of the notes i want a 2% uh vat
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:49.760]  it goes directly to the deficit no more than 10 years directly to the deficit just like 2% vat
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:59.760]  the copenhagen treaty calls for that goes directly to the deficit in fact here's the
[1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:09.680]  prisonplanet.com article from last friday before that was broadcast now e u wants global taxation
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:19.600]  global transaction tax to fund more bailouts what's in the treaty a global
[1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:33.040]  2% tax a value added tax on the entire gdp you just watch that pass and that happened you just
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:40.480]  watched glenn beck openly in front of you propose what's in the treaty just magically just exactly
[1:57:40.480 --> 1:57:46.240]  what they're calling for you would never expect it and now you will fight for it because glenn beck
[1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:52.000]  the one you trust the one that'll talk about the new world order tells you so
[1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:57.600]  and he'll also tell you there's no fema camps even when it's in the wall street journal in
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:04.160]  houston chronicle he'll tell you everything's fine and ron paul supporters are dangerous
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:08.960]  when ron paul has a chance of winning then say he's best friends with ron paul later
[1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:18.080]  to get your confidence to make sure in 2011 2012 ron paul gets sabotaged benedict arnold

[1:58:24.320 --> 1:58:28.640]  and he was a british agent the entire time and let me tell you something if you don't know that
[1:58:28.640 --> 1:58:34.960]  glenn beck is knowingly new world order you need to have your head examined but there he is
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:40.000]  and oh riley he's got the sales tax don't worry don't argue boys we're gonna get both of them

[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:12.960]  lines the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network christopher
[2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:19.360]  horner over a year ago wrote the book red hot lies how global warming alarmists use threats
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:26.960]  fraud and deception to keep you misinformed see this isn't new fraud the climate gate it just confirms
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:33.760]  that it's conscious i mean here's an example they'll show you the last 50 years of warming
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:38.480]  and have the hockey stick only showing a small part of it to make it look like it's going up
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:43.280]  but when you pull back you find out it's hardly a rise compared to what's happened in previous
[2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:48.960]  centuries and they know this and and they know polar bears can swim and they lie about that because
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:54.640]  they look cute and cuddly and they could scare kids saying that penguins can't swim and they've
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:59.840]  been caught a lot of other frauds so we have the expert who's been to six of these globalist
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:05.360]  global government global taxation meetings and he's christopher horner red hot lies
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:09.840]  how global warming alarmists use threats fraud and deception to keep you misinformed
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:15.760]  regnery 2008 uh and uh he also wrote the politically incorrect guide to global warming
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:20.560]  2007 new york times bestseller so this is the kind of guy we like somebody who was
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:25.920]  devastatingly accurate even before the latest information came out so we're going to talk
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:32.560]  about the constitutional crisis we're going to talk about obama saying i don't care uh i'm going
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:38.720]  to ram this even if congress doesn't go with this treaty i'm going to have the epa order it i mean
[2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:46.400]  as if he's hitler joe stalin uh we now have the internal treaty that says the third world actually
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:51.280]  has to make double the cuts which will actually destroy their economy they suckered the third
[2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:55.360]  world into getting behind it believing they were going to get some goodies now they find out it's
[2:09:55.360 --> 2:09:59.680]  really about the imf and world bank further looting them so we'll get this take on that as well
[2:09:59.680 --> 2:10:05.280]  christopher horner let's talk about what's currently happening and where you see this process going
[2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:11.760]  and uh then let's talk about the fraud of these individuals well on the international
[2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:17.120]  stage alex it's going uh as expected they have kicked any treaty or something that might be a
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:22.960]  treaty into next year and copenhagen will result in an historic agreement to meet again in mexico
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:27.440]  city next year which is how these have all turned out year after year which is why i stopped going
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:33.440]  and uh this actually was supposed to be a treaty producing conference but months ago we realized
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:38.000]  it was not going to be so where it leaves us is we'll get a promise of billions we don't know how
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:42.720]  much the demand is over a hundred billion dollars a year just from us and the offer on the table is
[2:10:42.720 --> 2:10:46.480]  something under 10 billion a year from us which is 10 too many they're even talking about three
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:54.720]  to upgrade the infrastructures of countries to better compete with us as we fund that upgrade
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:11:00.480]  through forcing our energy users to buy rescue ponds or what they're calling allowances to use
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:05.440]  fossil fuels hydrocarbon energy here for the shackling our economy but it's proceeding
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:09.680]  the wrong direction but at least it's going slowly let me tell you what mexico city is now
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:14.240]  the copenhagen discussion that we had all this build up for has now been kicked into next december
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:19.840]  november in mexico city november 8th is when it begins imagine the build up for this conference
[2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:25.520]  next year when our elections are on november 2nd next year which means every senate race has to
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:30.800]  have both candidates answer the question will you vote to ratify Kyoto to every single race has
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:36.320]  to confront that question every single house race must have both candidates confront the question
[2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:41.040]  would you vote up or down tell EPA they can't do this on their own so we've got the international
[2:11:41.040 --> 2:11:47.840]  track it's being delayed we've got the domestic tap trade that's being delayed that's good the more
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:52.160]  sunshine that gets on this stuff and disinfect it the more people see it the more outbreaks they get
[2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:55.840]  well chris let's not just glaze over the bombshell because i should have that you are one of the
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:00.800]  leading experts not just on the fraud of man may global warming or change as they call it when we've
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:06.080]  had climate change for four billion years you're one of the leading experts on the politics of this
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:11.760]  as well uh so so i mean you've been fighting this for decades specifically you just said
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:19.600]  that that that copenhagen is derailed yeah that what i'm saying is you're going to see a lot of
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:24.720]  press releases you do every december um it's going to be a historic agreement to meet again next year
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:29.200]  that's what every year has produced every conference as i said i went to a bunch of them they became
[2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:33.280]  very tiresome they have my picture up on the wall as a climate criminal get the heavies following
[2:12:33.280 --> 2:12:37.120]  around with cameras and everything else stealing my trash it really isn't worth going for them to
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:41.600]  emerge at the last hour with tears in their eyes waving around a piece of paper declaring green
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:46.320]  peace in our time and it's just a piece of paper admitting that they will do nothing more than agree
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:53.280]  to agree next year now that's a big deal because it makes it 2010 the year of Kyoto to yes 2010
[2:12:53.280 --> 2:12:58.400]  the year of cap and trade there's no reason except republicans are very skittish about these issues
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.600]  for which is you know their fault not that's not my burden uh that this should not be a campaign
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:08.000]  issue for everybody and that includes those republicans who voted for this eight of them
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:13.760]  two of them seeking higher office by the way uh as well as let's list them let's list who's
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:20.160]  we got graham doing it we have out of office the the globalist newt ganrich who are the
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:25.120]  republicans supporting this treason well there was this guy my castle in delaware who's now running
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:29.680]  for the senate seat then we've gotten you can see a great town hall meeting where he gets his
[2:13:29.680 --> 2:13:33.680]  head handed to him by a bunch of delawarians who do not blue hands i guess what you call them i
[2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:37.440]  don't know what their name is uh who did not care for this i mean it was a wonderful moment
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:41.280]  they'll look in his eye he says the easiest job in the world until they started paying attention
[2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:46.080]  and he voted for one too many tax increases this being the biggest tax increase cap and trade
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:51.520]  in american history then you've got this guy mark kerr who's running for the senate to replace the
[2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:56.640]  this roland burris barack obama's old seat uh he's republican from the north shore who said well i
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:00.720]  voted in favor of cap and trade because it it satisfies the narrow parochial interests of my
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:06.800]  wealthy district but i would vote to represent the whole state of illinois well i can't respect that
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:12.000]  kind of dance that's just insulting and you know i don't know why that's any better than a liberal
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:15.840]  who's going to vote that way anyway so was he apparently uh there were six other republicans
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:21.520]  there's a guy lennard lance in new jersey who put on his website excuse me some people put up on
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:27.280]  their website his constituent mail in which he boasts oh hey hey hey don't worry this is actually
[2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:32.240]  a wealth transfer from most of the rest of the country to the coastal elites he said it moves
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:38.160]  money from ohio and then in pennsylvania and missouri out to new jersey in california it does
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:43.280]  yeah so we've got people who frankly you know i won't miss them and well they're pirates but
[2:14:43.280 --> 2:14:48.240]  there's also uh some other people in the republican leadership supporting it well lindsay graham is the
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:53.200]  only well okay here's our problem in the republican senate lindsay graham is according to people in
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:57.600]  south carolina vying to be the secretary of defense because robert gatons on his way out
[2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:02.320]  and to do so he's ingratiating stuff with the obama administration by pushing cap and trade as
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:07.760]  a bit of a proxy for john mccain who even this time is not supporting it i say yet but at least
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:12.560]  he's not supporting it so graham's working with uh john carrey and joe leverman to find uh
[2:15:13.120 --> 2:15:19.200]  tripartisanship on this but graham brings no one with him and he's considering himself not even
[2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:24.000]  running for reelection as i understand it could be wrong the guy i'm more upset about is jude
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:29.200]  gregg who's done nothing publicly but quietly from senate sources i understand is making noises
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:34.640]  about wanting bipartisanship uber alice it's really it's more important that we find bipartisanship
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.480]  than what really is in the bill you know we're seeing that the country is plunging into a double
[2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:45.600]  dip recession into possible depression and we've got a globalist world government agreement according
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:53.200]  to van kyme moon and urman von rumpuy the head of the eu it openly gives two percent taxes on gdp
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:59.600]  the taxes to foreign banks imf world bank to run it a global un authority over air travel
[2:15:59.600 --> 2:16:05.440]  this will annihilate our economy and we've got senators who are for it because it's a new tax
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:10.560]  yeah we've got people who really they've been there too long jude gregg retiring and he's
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:16.400]  generally a decent as far as these things go member of the senate but um he thinks that bipartisanship
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:21.200]  before he leaves is very important i just agree this is the biggest tax increase in american history
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.600]  the president said that the purpose of it was to cause your energy prices to quote necessarily
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:30.400]  skyrocket that's not a side effect they're working on it's the point he's admitted this
[2:16:31.040 --> 2:16:35.920]  well what about morris strong's quote in 1992 about it's our job to destroy the industrial
[2:16:35.920 --> 2:16:41.280]  society morris strong you know he that was his fantasy of a novel character but that's actually
[2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:45.200]  how he feels i've testified next to him in the senate foreign relations committee and you never
[2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:49.760]  know that i mean he's this very unassuming looking man who holds these terrible anti population
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:54.800]  anti-growth anti-development views that are pervasive among the people pushing this energy
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:59.760]  rationing isn't this really all about eugenics at the bottom line a bunch of control freaks want
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:05.200]  to be able to decide literally what you eat and what you do and how many kids you have all about
[2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:11.440]  no but i will say this the population zealots the pro-state the pro-tax the anti-growth the
[2:17:11.440 --> 2:17:15.440]  anti-development anti-property rights the persistent communists the fallen communists
[2:17:15.440 --> 2:17:20.080]  they're all on this so i can't say it's all about that the global governance type love it
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:24.160]  they're all there's a bunch of rent takers g e duke energy excellent they're all looking to
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:29.520]  pick your pockets in the name of no no i understand there's a giant ship of pirates but at its core
[2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:35.840]  for my research the rationale of the big elite supporting it is we got to cut off people's energy
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:40.240]  i mean look at the communist chinese last week saying we'll sign on to this if you have a global
[2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:48.320]  one-child policy right in fact china even i think it was a year no two years ago in bangkok at one
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:53.280]  of these negotiations i said that they wanted to sell us carbon offsets i have this in red hot
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:57.840]  lives by the way no one else has covered this except one public source where i found it the chinese
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:03.360]  proposed getting carbon offsets recognized under kiyoto to sell europe and us derived from their
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:08.800]  coercive family planning policies what they said Alex was our emissions are now at x and they would
[2:18:08.800 --> 2:18:13.600]  be at you know 1.9 x if we didn't have our policies in place therefore these are emission
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:20.240]  reduction they're not their emissions avoided by uh rather cruel totalitarian policies but
[2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:26.480]  they wanted carbon offset and the un uh this this group that runs kiyoto the un fccc and the european
[2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:30.800]  stuff that was a wonderful idea because that's really what a lot of people are in this for
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:35.520]  encourage of course there's no doubt uh but there's not a universal motivator remember enron got this
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:40.320]  thing going i know this because i worked for enron at the time in 97 they told me it was my
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:44.800]  number one priority to get a global warming treaty internationally exempt indian china because they
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:49.040]  were building coal-fired power plants there oh is that how you woke up christopher that's how i got
[2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:53.920]  into this yes i was innocently practicing law and they told me that i was director of federal
[2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:57.440]  government relations for enron for about three weeks and they told me to do this and i told them
[2:18:57.440 --> 2:19:03.440]  to do something else and i reported ways but uh yeah that was my eye opening experience i wasn't
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:07.360]  aware that these things actually went on believe it or not well you're an amazing yes i'm really
[2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:12.240]  impressed i mean uh when we get back i want to talk about red hot lies and how you pegged them
[2:19:12.800 --> 2:19:18.240]  as how how the alarm issues threats fraud and deception to keep you misinformed i mean you
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:22.320]  knew a year and a half ago when you were writing this it's been out for a year that this is a group
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:28.400]  who knowingly are engaged in fraud so let's look at the scientists themselves then you talk about g e
[2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:33.040]  and big banks and big corporations wanting it to pick pockets you talk about the un wanting it
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:38.640]  you talk about the uh no growthers the eugenicists wanting it but but who are these scientists in
[2:19:38.640 --> 2:19:44.960]  any uh last week we got a un document from years ago where they were directing the scientist
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:50.560]  to to unify the fraud along collectivism uh amazing to have christopher horner on with us i
[2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:56.480]  didn't read through his whole bio it's uh quite uh amazing and will be right back on the other side

[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:34.320]  head meeting with the rockefellers and an inside baseball al gore story then i want to get into
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:40.400]  the premeditated fraud of these people and and and what their agenda really is christopher continue
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:45.280]  oh well i was discussing somebody who remained nameless who used to be with an oil company who's
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:49.600]  now pushing the global warming agenda a very nice guy debated him on several occasions but
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:53.440]  very wrong on the issues and i don't understand where he's coming from but
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:57.280]  anyway he told me he meant with one of the deep pockets for this and you mentioned them
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:04.560]  funding the alarmist activities and that they said you know gore's killing us and we got to get
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:08.880]  around him and i told him how do you get around the guy who's bragging he got 300 million dollars
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:13.520]  from someone to rebrand global warming into climate crisis and this guy said to me back
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:16.960]  oh don't worry william riley's group has a billion the rockefellers have at least 500
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:21.200]  million or something like that uh it's not gore's money he's just he's the guy to get some of the
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:26.000]  attention and he's killing the movement i said well you know my heart bleeds for you that's too
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:34.560]  bad couldn't happen to a to a nicer bunch of folks he really does radiate a type of demonic
[2:25:34.560 --> 2:25:39.440]  nulliness i don't know how to describe it but everyone i know just cringes when they see him
[2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:46.560]  on television just the arrogant uh almost a lizard-like look on his face it's not he really
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:54.640]  here's the thing um he scripted tries to navigate the waters of dishonesty but with word choice and
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:59.600]  things like this uh he's clearly read the uk high court opinion which threw out every claim and
[2:25:59.600 --> 2:26:05.440]  then when he's unscripted on the rare rare moment he's challenged he will just tell whoppers he did
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:09.520]  on msnbc the other day you know like when he's unscripted he says things like your scores and
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:16.400]  millions of degrees and so on but um he just uh i think he's uh he's a wonderful face for their
[2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:21.360]  movement i can't think of i really thought he was the gift keeps on giving keep him out there
[2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:25.920]  whoever gave him 300 million dollars and i don't know if you saw the 60 minutes piece but he's there
[2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:29.920]  and steve croft have to actually ask him when gore was bragging about this 300 million dollars he
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:33.840]  got and remember al gore says where you get your money dictate your motivations in your opinion
[2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:37.760]  and if you got a bunch of money from anybody you sold out so on so i just want to know
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:43.120]  since he set the rules so steve croft on 60 minutes actually asked him where'd you get it
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:50.000]  and gore freezes and he freezes and croft just waits for an answer and his wife takes al's arm
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:56.640]  and says al i'll handle this steve we donated our uh Nobel prize money and matched it and croft
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:02.960]  accepted that moved on without realizing that left him 298.6 million dollars short of 300 million
[2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:08.800]  and gore told us who sees this as such a profitable investment to give you that kind of money we know
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:14.720]  it's soros and we know it uh the guy's a client of perkins his investment the captain his the
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:18.800]  venture capital partners who sink their money in these white elephants that will that's right he'll
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:26.160]  give the chicken feed 500 000 prize or a million bucks from a book but he's keeping the blood
[2:27:26.160 --> 2:27:31.680]  and gore consortium he's going to make the money he's keeping his stock in occidental petroleum
[2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:38.880]  he's he's keeping all the profits from the system he's setting up that he and and people like the
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:46.320]  president roc obama owned stakes in i mean it's just a unbelievable fraud well the thing is he
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:50.640]  gets away by saying uh you know i didn't know you were against capitalism and to believe that i'm
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:56.240]  doing this for money you don't know me but it's true he could be a a true believer except like
[2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:01.200]  i say occasionally he speaks in such careful language that he knows what he says is is untrue
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:06.160]  well why does he have a 20 room mansion if he really believes carbon dioxide is a nerve gas
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:11.760]  that is used to you know kill enemy troops i mean if he really believes what plants breathe
[2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:16.400]  is like the most deadly vx nerve gas on earth why does he have a building emitting so much
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:21.600]  nerve gas that's actually not just positive to my mind there are people like him who who
[2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:26.800]  may not i mean either i understand either alec he doesn't believe a word he says which is possible
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:30.400]  or he believes there are different rules for different people and he's special and i get the
[2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:35.200]  feeling he's one of those but he's got more of these joints okay and he lives the way that he cannot
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:40.640]  he cannot possibly believe that buying a carbon offset credit from planting trees which is an
[2:28:40.640 --> 2:28:46.800]  accounting gimmick giving you 80 years of life if the tree lives that long uh and never dies by the
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:50.640]  way and releases the CO2 back in the atmosphere in one year you just you can't possibly believe
[2:28:50.640 --> 2:28:56.240]  these phony schemes offset his contribution so i'm torn it seems to me difficult to believe
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:02.240]  that this is anything more than sort of uh baby boomer narcissism and new age mysticism he can't
[2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:07.680]  well well yeah what about ted ternary has five kids more houses than anybody else in america
[2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:13.680]  i read in people magazine literally something like 50 something houses 20 something jets yachts
[2:29:13.680 --> 2:29:19.600]  everywhere but he says i should only be able to have one child these guys know their frauds they
[2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:25.360]  just cold bloodedly won our resources and they know we're well meaning and may be con and say
[2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:30.640]  okay i guess rape me take everything i got if it's for the earth ted ternary's right that's right

[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:11.280]  you i definitely want to have you back up soon very impressive discussions you also talk about
[2:34:11.280 --> 2:34:16.880]  the harassment you've gone through with greenpeace and other eugenicists but before we go there let's
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:22.800]  go over their lies their scientific fraud the premeditated fact these aren't tree hugging idiots
[2:34:22.800 --> 2:34:28.960]  who are just making mistakes they know what they're doing yeah i thought this climate gate while it's
[2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:33.920]  that you can tell by the effort being expended to diminish its importance this is more than a
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:38.880]  thousand emails but it's not just the email the computer code annotations for the code and document
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:43.760]  the point is they're still going through to figure out what's in there they were not hackers stolen
[2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:47.760]  as far as we can tell they were leaked by an apparent whistleblower they were not personal
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:51.520]  emails all of these things the media are telling you to distract you aren't true because this is
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:57.200]  devastating what it does is it affirms in the principal's own words what i wrote in this stupid
[2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:01.840]  science tricks chapter of red hot lies i named these guys by name and i described what they were
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:05.360]  doing there are more and there are more people involved here it's a fairly broad movement but
[2:35:05.360 --> 2:35:10.320]  this is at the upper echelon of the highest compensated levels of climate science on which
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:16.320]  we spend billions every year by the way so you know it's settled science right and they're admitting
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:21.040]  what they've been doing they've been grafting not just apples norges together but in showing a
[2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:25.760]  in reconstructing temperatures and waving it around and publishing it in the referee literature
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:30.000]  they're grafting apples and stethoscopes they're taking tree rings and they're saying this is a
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:35.040]  proxy for climate it's a pretty good proxy for precipitation but they're using it as a thermometer
[2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:39.680]  okay and then they put on thermometer measurements because the tree rings show a cooling well the
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:44.560]  thermometer measurements which as i show in red hot lies are increasingly taken over barbeque grills
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:50.880]  in hawkins oakentucky uh phoenix sky harbour airport runway when he uh tucson parking lot when he
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:56.240]  used to be out in the field i mean they're playing games with uh with the data as well out of nasa
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:36:02.880]  which is why we've got a notice of intent to sue them by the way and they're grafting a on to b in
[2:36:02.880 --> 2:36:07.200]  order to present the picture that they admit in their emails they need to be true they want to be
[2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:12.800]  true has to be true some of them say we know it's true even though we can't see it and these are
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:18.240]  scientific these are the lead this was an ipcc un intergovernmental panel on climate change
[2:36:18.240 --> 2:36:23.680]  lead author this guy named kevin trendworth said in two of the emails it's a travesty that he can't
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:29.520]  find the global warming that he knows is there because his heart tells him so his computer models
[2:36:29.520 --> 2:36:33.920]  tell him so but our lie and eyes don't tell him so and that's a travesty he says we need to go out
[2:36:33.920 --> 2:36:39.360]  and get better measurements we have caught them for example this summer our national oceanic and
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:45.040]  atmospheric administration which presently is in copenhagen right now with a big reception room
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:50.400]  with moving visuals i read about melting glaciers and so on you're paying for this
[2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:56.560]  this summer in order to make its claims of temperatures going up above just slowly backed
[2:36:56.560 --> 2:37:02.000]  out of their calculations they dropped the satellite measures measurements of the ocean temperatures
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:07.360]  why well the oceans are cooling the computer models also the oceans are warming the oceans cover two
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:12.480]  thirds of the earth's surface if you include ocean cooling they've got a problem so what did they do
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:18.080]  they said we know it's warming so there must be a bias that the satellite temperatures must be wrong
[2:37:18.080 --> 2:37:21.280]  there's something wrong with our observations who are you gonna believe my computer model or your
[2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:25.760]  lie and eyes and so on and so on and so on and i detail these tricks and red hot lies the
[2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.560]  principles have now detailed them in their own words and these emails computer codes and so on
[2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:35.200]  talking about tricks to hide the decline in temperature putting in a all capital that says
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:41.120]  insert very artificial decline here all sorts of other claims in which they're admitting they
[2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:45.520]  know exactly what they're doing they use the words fudge and so on fudge factors for their data
[2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:51.280]  to get the desired results and now the control corporate media is teaching us hide the decline
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:58.480]  fudge that doesn't mean what you think anymore that means save the polar bears right the most
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:03.840]  embarrassing exercise was when the media spent about eight days telling us the trick was really
[2:38:03.840 --> 2:38:08.560]  a scientific colloquialism and it means different things to people yes and i said that's great what
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:13.520]  about the word hide or the decline but they didn't focus on that they said well trick doesn't mean
[2:38:13.520 --> 2:38:17.680]  trick uh the reasonable meanings and the plain meanings aren't reasonable only the unreasonable
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:20.960]  extrapolations are what they really meant and they're saying it was in the key and you've also
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:26.080]  got statements like this is just horrible we can't account for the decline in temperatures how do we
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:31.360]  hide it i mean it's so clear and then they're persecuting other scientists and working with
[2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:36.160]  government colluding oh after i explained it to the government they're not going to release it
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:40.800]  now they know what type of people these are and and one of the heads of the un propaganda got
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:46.000]  questioned by a filmmaker for uh friday in kopenhagen it's up on info wars dot com
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  we'll play the video later folks and it's a press conference he gets up to ask the question
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:57.040]  and the guy says oh i don't talk about things that come from people that are this immoral
[2:38:57.040 --> 2:39:02.960]  now this comes from immoral people and these are private emails and he has armed armed guard
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:07.280]  to come in and start grabbing them and dragging them out i mean these people are authority very
[2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:11.920]  authoritarian let me tell you something uh i've got a chapter read our lives and talk at quote
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:17.840]  these people all over the place openly wistful about oh if we only have an enlightened totalitarian
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:23.680]  system like china we could get this agenda in place and that argument is now out in the open i
[2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:28.400]  believe it's tom freedman at the new york times has been recently making it oh if only we had that
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:33.600]  system we need to suspend certain liberties just just certain liberties and just for a little while
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.800]  because democracy they say is getting in the way and people who are we have we have been unable to
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:42.720]  convince them to do what's in their own self-interest we're going to have to make it happen somehow
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:48.160]  and i quote them throughout that chapter they really are getting unabashed about this because
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:52.400]  no one's calling them on it instead as you pointed out the media are covering for them i mean
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:58.560]  thrown in full out advocates participants in the global warming industry they've always been
[2:39:58.560 --> 2:40:03.280]  sensationalist but this goes far beyond that i detail that in in fact the opening chapter so
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:08.480]  what none of what's come out recently are revelations they're all affirmations by the way
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:13.440]  there was not one personal email that we can find so far yet they assign that to everything
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:19.120]  they say this it all shows science as it should be and yet it's just it's terrible that these
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:26.240]  things got out and so on but the good news is christopher horner the public isn't buying
[2:40:26.240 --> 2:40:32.400]  the associated press and cnn telling us nothing to see here move along i mean do you agree that this
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:39.520]  is devastating because all the fraud and all the expos days were building and through the grass
[2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:45.520]  roots the people were learning and people were seeing fortune 500 get behind it and and and really
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:51.680]  a backlash was already there and then now you're going to tax what plants breathe and and al gore
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:57.440]  making all this money i mean is this not devastating them i truly believe it isn't again their reaction
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:41:02.480]  tells quite a lot and they the length to which the media are going to stop their agenda from taking
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:09.360]  water is instructive now uh what are we going to see well the president is talking about uh he's
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:14.560]  in fact guardian has reported this i wrote a an article in the march issue of what's called engage
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:20.640]  which is the federal society's uh publication detailing how uh what's called a congressional
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:25.440]  executive agreement which we have plenty of for example nasa is a treaty that we decided
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:30.960]  wasn't a treaty and therefore you waive the constitution's article two section two requirement
[2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:36.080]  of two-thirds ratification two-thirds ratification will never happen for this so what the president
[2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:40.800]  according to the guardian now the old red herself the guardian has reported that the administration
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:46.080]  is briefing european diplomat as i've also written to prepare them for the prospect that we must have
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:51.600]  we need to write this in a way that it's got to be plausibly declared not a treaty because then
[2:41:51.600 --> 2:41:57.360]  they can say all it takes is 50 plus one of both houses and no amendment up or down no filibuster
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:42:01.520]  vote under what they call fast track now there's precedent for this in the trade context but not
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:07.520]  enough in a global energy rationing selective punitive wealth transfer scheme so and then on
[2:42:07.520 --> 2:42:13.280]  top of it he's saying if you don't ratify it i'm still going to implement it yeah then we've got
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:17.600]  the epa flying now that doesn't satisfy the wealth transfer but and it doesn't bind us
[2:42:17.600 --> 2:42:22.000]  internationally however it will you still can't possibly get buried that in these enormous spending
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:29.920]  bills now late lately more dead on our on my kids and theirs and epa threatening to do this here's
[2:42:29.920 --> 2:42:34.400]  what i just so you know nobody wants to take ownership of this hot potato they were furious
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:38.960]  that bush wouldn't start this rulemaking after we lost that supreme court case that he kicked it into
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:44.640]  this administration now recently epa declared co2 is a is a dangerous human health environment
[2:42:44.640 --> 2:42:49.760]  to which i first say try living without it but now they're going to say we'll issue this finding and
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:54.720]  it's being published tomorrow in the federal register and then they're going to try something
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:43:00.160]  unlawful which is to say do sort of a half arse maneuver with it so that the green groups then
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:05.200]  march into court and they and the courts get assigned responsibility for this in other words
[2:43:05.200 --> 2:43:09.600]  they won't go all the way in implementing it but they know that the green groups under the clean air
[2:43:09.600 --> 2:43:15.360]  act can make them so it's not really possible to liability but that's their route alex they don't
[2:43:15.360 --> 2:43:21.040]  want to they say sure i mean it's criminal it's by stealth it's it's creeping like a spider creeping
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:26.800]  up your bed at night to bite you uh look at schwarzzenegger he couldn't get the legislature
[2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:32.560]  to put a tax on tv's or banned big ones so he just did it under the california energy agency
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:39.040]  uh look at what's happening in washington state where employers tax you now off how you drive
[2:43:39.040 --> 2:43:42.800]  and they have to collect the money i mean they're already implementing this everywhere
[2:43:43.840 --> 2:43:49.040]  we know under unesco they're brainwashing kids in public school i mean this is a criminal
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:55.840]  cult of of of pirates how do we ever extricate ourselves from them how do we ever remove them
[2:43:55.840 --> 2:44:01.280]  hopefully some type of criminal charges against these different scientists engage in fraud i mean
[2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:08.720]  is there anything we can do to this to this this this gang of of boobies well cei competitive
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:13.280]  enterprise institute that i'm associated with his petition dpa to reopen the record on the basis
[2:44:13.280 --> 2:44:17.520]  of the scandal that's been exposed or i say affirmed there are people looking into what are
[2:44:17.520 --> 2:44:22.800]  called key kms issues where you essentially sue on behalf of the king and recover the king's treasure
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:27.600]  because again there's an apparent there's an intent to the fraud on the face of these emails and
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:33.200]  in the annotated computer code people are looking at riko actions against these individuals because
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:39.680]  fraud could trigger that and so on so whether i know that i don't know there there are attempts to
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:45.920]  whitewash at the various universities involved right now i've got a uh notice of intent to
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:50.720]  sue nafta by the end of the year it'll be january before i get around to it if they don't cough up
[2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:54.720]  their equivalent of this data in these emails because i've been denied for more than two years
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:58.560]  and i finally had enough when this thing broke and so we're going to have to use the courts just
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:03.600]  like they do now if we get involved in this treaty it has a provision that has a three-year
[2:45:03.600 --> 2:45:08.880]  cooling off period for getting out which is three years to generate all sorts of you saw what they
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:14.800]  did the u.s under bush uh three years of generating intense diplomatic and political pressure against
[2:45:14.800 --> 2:45:19.680]  america to stay in and interject energy rasting and wealth transfer scheme so you can't get into
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:23.600]  this mess now let me tell you something there's a three-legged stool they're pushing it's the
[2:45:23.600 --> 2:45:29.040]  kyoto scheme which on its face was not binding but our courts might just implement it but with the
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:35.840]  law of the c treaty which has a tribunal which we will have to implement uh their rulings here um
[2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:41.200]  and we are supposedly going to ratify an obama's first term in office in fact next year and then
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:46.160]  the international criminal court which we're told we're going to resign the roam statue the treaty
[2:45:46.160 --> 2:45:50.960]  creating the international criminal court well you get those three as he planned and you've got a real
[2:45:50.960 --> 2:45:57.360]  real terrifying serious problem you've got a very difficult problem to manage as a matter of law
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:02.160]  because our courts are increasingly radicalized as you know but increasingly international
[2:46:02.160 --> 2:46:07.040]  and the swing vote on this issue quite clearly is just as kennedy and he's on record saying we need
[2:46:07.040 --> 2:46:12.240]  to find out what those nice europeans think our constitution says before we uh implemented ourselves
[2:46:12.240 --> 2:46:17.040]  so we've got a problem you don't get involved in the treaties but america is being swallowed by an
[2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:23.440]  unelected private offshore corporate government the new world order well let's just say there are people
[2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:28.160]  who have us in their side and they see us coming let me tell you something you think obama politically
[2:46:28.160 --> 2:46:32.080]  can afford to walk away from copenhagen without some piece of paper and and even though it's going to
[2:46:32.080 --> 2:46:35.760]  be a transfer of wealth from here to there politically knowing how politics works and his
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:40.800]  base in the media no so indian china and the rest of the world see him coming they know when he goes
[2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:45.120]  over there on friday he has to give them whatever they want because he cannot leave empty-handed
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:50.640]  from copenhagen in an embarrassment twice in one year in his first year in office so they see him
[2:46:50.640 --> 2:46:57.280]  coming we have an we have an amateur but an amateur with all the wrong instincts and a very dangerous
[2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:04.560]  agenda and therefore uh let me just say this um we we're going to be as active as we possibly can
[2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:09.440]  be through the courts here through cpi with whatever our resources will allow and i'm hoping
[2:47:09.440 --> 2:47:14.320]  some private entities will stand up for once and stop trying to cut a deal and fight back and that's
[2:47:14.320 --> 2:47:18.480]  another big point you made all these big corporations if they're not behind the swindling
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:23.440]  they've said okay i'll join you just don't don't rape me and that's what the epa said last week as
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:29.200]  you know they said look all you big corporations get in line or we're going to selectively enforce
[2:47:29.200 --> 2:47:34.160]  i mean they're literally like a mobster beaten up the little grocery store owner when are we
[2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:40.160]  going to grow a backbone to these parasites and say no it's even worse than window insurance what
[2:47:40.160 --> 2:47:44.160]  they were saying was tapping the cage and saying you better uh pay me to protect you from my lunatic
[2:47:44.160 --> 2:47:48.320]  friend here be ashamed that this thing got out of the cage but the problem is they also said it that
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:53.120]  day later we plan on doing both no matter what you pass in congress we plan on trying to do what we
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:56.640]  can down to the clean air act anyway let me tell you about a provision in these two cap and trade
[2:47:56.640 --> 2:48:01.600]  bills real quickly they're 500 pages different size okay they're not the same bill but they have
[2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:05.840]  one provision that was identically drafted and buried in both in the senate bill is called section
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:13.680]  707 and what it says is every law every law in the united states code shall not may shall be
[2:48:13.680 --> 2:48:18.560]  implemented by the president as a co2 suppression law a carbon dioxide suppression global warming
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:22.800]  law it's a carbon dictatorship that's the department of agriculture and interior permitting
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:27.280]  that's the tax code that's the dangerous species active everything there's no certainty for sale
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:31.680]  and these suckers in business who keep saying well i just need certainty i need to buy peace i'm
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:35.760]  going to super peace good luck buddy you are selling us all out thinking you're getting yourself a deal
[2:48:35.760 --> 2:48:41.280]  and you are not yeah there's no making a deal with these vampires i mean this is a greedy
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:47.360]  i mean folks i'm not trying to demonize them i've studied them these are really hellish horrible
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:53.200]  control freaks i mean at the end of the day they aren't going to stop are they no look at the
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:57.200]  provisions they're putting in these bills they want full and total control in the name of global
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:00.800]  warming by alex we're saving the planet what about the children you wouldn't want to be a tonight you
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:05.120]  wouldn't want to kill children would you i mean they practice their routine the problem is certainty
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:10.000]  is not for sale and i've got all these businesses i've had at least two CEOs say to me well chris
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:15.280]  i just need certainty and they don't get it read the bill i know it's 1300 pages long but somebody
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:20.320]  has to read the bill certainty is not for sale you cannot super peace with these people the day
[2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:25.840]  goes into effect you know what they want more and i want let me leave you with this did you know
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:31.040]  that nothing ever proposed cap and trade legislation kiyoto would according to anybody under any
[2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:38.080]  scenario or set of assumptions detectively impact the climate so the it is not reasonable to conclude
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:42.720]  it's about the climate it's only reasonable to conclude it's about what it would do and you know
[2:49:42.720 --> 2:49:49.200]  what it would do but it's not about what it would do that's just not logical unbelievable we've got
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:54.000]  to have you back up just to break down the legislation quickly in the last minute we've got
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:58.960]  do you think that they're going to be able to ram through the the cap and trade i mean not the treaty
[2:49:58.960 --> 2:50:02.800]  but the cap and trade bill that's passed the house they're trying to shake people down as you
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:06.560]  described with epa i don't think folks are buying it i think there's a chance we'll get a one line
[2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:10.880]  the epa uh clean air act is written shall not be implemented this way but the dems will fight that
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:16.800]  tooth and nail so the long answer is uh is to add that to no but it will not be without a struggle
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:20.960]  in the spring they're going to try to slip it in because you don't pass the biggest tax increase
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:27.600]  in american history late in an even number meaning election year and they just don't they just don't
[2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:32.480]  care how unpopular they are there is that sense of urgency that they're rushing everything through
[2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:38.560]  if we can hold them another two years will their global carbon dictatorship be derailed permanently

[3:08:41.760 --> 3:08:46.320]  the last three years but you know that's just the local meters i guess the u n will have to fix those
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:53.360]  high the decline in the sea level he is a critic of the ipcc and the notion that global sea level
[3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:59.360]  is rising and he currently spoke in the Copenhagen at the climate realist meeting and a lot of these
[3:08:59.360 --> 3:09:05.600]  events got disrupted by george soros goons meanwhile if you were accredited press at the u n events
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:09.440]  and and we're going to show some of this video in the background without audio and politely
[3:09:09.440 --> 3:09:15.440]  asked questions about climate gate men with guns came and they drag you out so this is literally
[3:09:15.440 --> 3:09:21.840]  like the soviet union or nazi germany uh doctor thank you for joining us here again an expert on
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:27.520]  sea levels of the former head of your department before retiring it's an honor to have you thank
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:32.480]  you very much uh well tell us a little bit about your scientific background you uh went to this
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:39.360]  meeting uh why you're a critic of it what's really happening with with our oceans yes first of all
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:49.680]  i have been working on sea level for 40 years and i have written 190 peer reviewed scientific papers
[3:09:49.680 --> 3:09:57.680]  and i have given about 320 scientific lecture lectures at main conferences most of them as
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:04.960]  keynote speakers so i know the subject and i even got the price for what i have done in sea level
[3:10:04.960 --> 3:10:12.400]  business so what is the difference between me and ipcc and the others i am looking in the field
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:20.640]  i am looking at the observational facts the other are fiddling on their computers playing
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:27.520]  and they have something which they want to prove and then they try to do that i don't do that i just
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:34.800]  let the nature tell me the fact and from that i get a completely different story than they
[3:10:34.800 --> 3:10:46.880]  get i am so please continue go ahead yeah so for example i have spent six expeditions to the mold
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:57.840]  dives mold that is a wonderful nation of 100 1200 small islands none of them is higher than 2.5
[3:10:57.840 --> 3:11:06.720]  meter above sea level so they are extremely vulnerable for storms and tsunamis of course
[3:11:06.720 --> 3:11:14.240]  but the question is is sea rising and will it really flood the um those islands so they will
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:24.400]  be wiped out as ipcc says in 50 or at the most 100 years and the the answer is sure absolutely
[3:11:24.400 --> 3:11:31.760]  from sheer field evidence it's no sea level is stable has been completely stable in the last
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:39.040]  30 maybe 50 years and i have in our group which was really sea level specialist we have been
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:48.400]  running on exposed coast on swamps on the lakes in in lagoons all kind of different
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:55.920]  environments and lots of islands always with the same results and then a couple of times we have
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:03.680]  something which tells very objectively for example we had a wonderful tree standing nearly
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:12.000]  out in the water and it has been there at least for for 50 years so we know that any slight this
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:18.480]  little rise in sea level would have wiped it out and for 50 years there has to be such sea level
[3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:26.800]  rise so there was a evidence if the tree people may lie if ipcc especially but but doctor how do
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:32.720]  you get around how do you get around government officials in scuba gear signing agreements
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:39.280]  underwater i mean all they engage in is frauds i mean they say polar bears can't swim and are all
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:46.720]  dying when their numbers are more than tripled i mean these people live breathe sleep fraud they
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:53.040]  are they are frauds i mean i sir i'm no i'm no sea level expert top scientist you know in the world
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:57.760]  like yourself you know you're a former head of a university on the subject but i know how to go
[3:12:57.760 --> 3:13:04.160]  look at sea level records for galveston texas san francisco california i went and randomly did it
[3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:08.480]  they have exact measurements taken by the coast guard in the last hundred years from their weather
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:13.200]  stations as you know you have these all over the world and it showed that in the last hundred years
[3:13:13.200 --> 3:13:18.320]  it goes up a foot down a foot up a foot down a foot year after year it just it's pretty much
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:23.920]  constant isn't it yes that's exactly but the interesting thing with what we were doing in
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:29.360]  the mold i have to return to that that tree which was an evidence and i told the people there look
[3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:38.880]  at your own tree you won't knew what happened when we were coming back to shoot a tv tv documentary
[3:13:38.880 --> 3:13:48.160]  in 2003 the tree had was down and i thought wow i was wrong the sea has taken it but then it was
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:54.880]  a little restaurant just beside which we were sit used to sit and watch the tree because we like
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:14:00.560]  the tree and we asked them when what what happened with the trees and no no no no it was not the
[3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:08.560]  sea it was a group of australian scientists but which who pulled it down by hand to destroy my
[3:14:08.560 --> 3:14:16.240]  evidence oh my gosh i mean the oh i'm so this is a group of criminals all they do is engage in
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:26.400]  fraud that is how far it sometimes goes so um that's why i recently made a picture out of
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:34.320]  these things which were revealed in the emails from east anglia university that is something
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:43.600]  which we now see like the tip of an iceberg above the sea level but beneath it it's so much
[3:14:43.600 --> 3:14:50.720]  shabby things which were enormous quantities and i gave you one of those that is the tree so the
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:57.920]  president of the mold dive he has gone out he has been standing in the water and he has had
[3:14:57.920 --> 3:15:06.240]  his cabinet under the water in order to say that we are being drawn but why does he say that because
[3:15:06.240 --> 3:15:14.480]  the moment he says that first of all he was invited to Copenhagen secondly his nation is guaranteed
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:19.440]  a very large sum of he's been bought off so describe this tree again i'm intrigued so it's
[3:15:19.440 --> 3:15:25.680]  a little rock outcrop like we see in many areas there was a tree just a foot or so above and so
[3:15:25.680 --> 3:15:31.360]  the the outcropping was still there but they came and knocked down the tree yes i mean just
[3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:37.920]  absolutely vicious criminal creatures i wish the people at the restaurant would have videotaped
[3:15:37.920 --> 3:15:44.720]  these these these these these jack-o-lanterns i was so happy that that i got the right story
[3:15:44.720 --> 3:15:51.840]  and because they had been upset because they also liked it and i know precisely by the way
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:59.600]  that it was a month or two before me there was a group and i know exactly which group it was
[3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:05.520]  which visited the island and they went there in order to so to say contradict me
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:14.320]  but they couldn't do it they want to confront those which was could change my story but
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:21.520]  they could cut the tree or pull down the tree so this is how things are going
[3:16:21.520 --> 3:16:28.960]  then we have other areas like Tuvalu which is an island in the pacific which is notorious
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:35.520]  because it's claimed that it's already in the process of being flooded and that was the
[3:16:36.720 --> 3:16:42.880]  nation which was supposed to sue united states because she you were supposed to put up the
[3:16:42.880 --> 3:16:48.960]  maximum carbon dioxide now they didn't do that because they didn't dare so the fact is there
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:54.560]  that we have a measurement the tide gauge which have measured the sea level the mean sea level
[3:16:54.560 --> 3:17:03.360]  for 30 years and there is absolutely no right absolutely no right then the local people there
[3:17:03.360 --> 3:17:09.680]  which is the notes what it is is the meteorological observatory meteorological so it's friends of
[3:17:09.680 --> 3:17:17.920]  ipcc they in in their website they take a photo of their observatory at high tide it's green grass
[3:17:17.920 --> 3:17:24.960]  in front and then they take the photo at the extreme store flooding and then it won't risk that
[3:17:24.960 --> 3:17:31.040]  the doorstep and they show a storm surge so they show it at low tide knowing the public doesn't
[3:17:31.040 --> 3:17:37.600]  know their tides so those if it is an accidental storm of course it has nothing what's so ever
[3:17:37.600 --> 3:17:43.360]  to do with the rising sea level it's just something which happened they are up and on
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:50.720]  which sea level is going so doctor let me bring this up to fool us we have the other vanuato
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:56.640]  which is another guy where they said that people had to leave the country because it was flooded
[3:17:56.640 --> 3:18:02.400]  again the tide gauge is the only thing we have the only evidence is a tide gauge for 15 years
[3:18:02.400 --> 3:18:09.680]  and it's completely stable but but that's what i'm a doctor yeah that's what i'm bringing up
[3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:15.680]  and you went to kopenhagen what is it like to stand face to face with people that know
[3:18:15.680 --> 3:18:20.800]  it's a fraud who just want to set up a global tax i mean they know it's a fraud they know
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:26.880]  their criminals is it because they just want research money no they fell out there and unfortunately
[3:18:26.880 --> 3:18:34.880]  our group had its own meeting and we could never face the other side that was a very
[3:18:34.880 --> 3:18:40.160]  sad thing because we wanted to face them but they didn't did the other side didn't want to
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:46.160]  to see us or hear about us so that is we went though they did send out though some of their
[3:18:46.160 --> 3:18:51.280]  minions to disrupt some of your events yeah but they couldn't succeed with that they tried but
[3:18:51.280 --> 3:18:56.960]  it didn't work very well so they're behind armed guards and then they send out their their their
[3:18:56.960 --> 3:19:04.080]  minions it's very simple if you have if you have the what you believe is the truth behind it
[3:19:04.080 --> 3:19:13.280]  it's easy to make correct and strong wording and the same you can you you nearly see in the face
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:20.240]  of people who say the right thing or have to put up a lie because that's it's something in the eyes
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:27.440]  which you reveal what you are saying i was recently the month ago i was in Bangladesh
[3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:34.240]  Bangladesh is the country of the world with his most vulnerable to floodings and cyclones
[3:19:34.240 --> 3:19:38.560]  and then monsoon will receive stay there doctor we've got to go to break come back and tell us
[3:19:38.560 --> 3:19:44.800]  about that okay we have a top sea level expert i don't know if you call it hydrologist he just
[3:19:44.800 --> 3:19:53.360]  retired he was the head of paleo geophysics and geodynamics department at stockham university
[3:19:53.360 --> 3:19:59.840]  i guess he registers hydrology on a global scale and uh he's exposing the criminals
[3:20:01.200 --> 3:20:08.160]  this is an emergency alert do not take risky vaccinations this fall i'm dr Leonard Horowitz

[3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:16.880]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the americans at home i have tremendous influence
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:22.800]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[3:21:22.800 --> 3:21:29.280]  of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[3:21:29.280 --> 3:21:35.680]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:40.640]  government tim geithner bernanke they're arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[3:21:40.640 --> 3:21:45.360]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[3:23:02.160 --> 3:23:07.040]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[3:23:07.040 --> 3:23:11.920]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:23:11.920 --> 3:23:16.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:22.000]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:26.960]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[3:23:26.960 --> 3:23:32.400]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:37.680]  grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five a
[3:23:37.680 --> 3:23:42.560]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[3:23:42.560 --> 3:23:47.040]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can

[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:11.280]  in 1913 close to 100 years ago a fraud as big as the Copenhagen global government takeover
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:17.120]  happened to our nation a private group of banks paid off the government to give them the power to
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:27.280]  issue currency and credit and now 97 years later the very same group of banking families are setting
[3:24:27.280 --> 3:24:34.240]  up a global tax on all human activity we're talking to one of the world experts on sea levels
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:41.680]  niles a dr. niles axel mourner he joins us from sweden he just got back from the
[3:24:41.680 --> 3:24:47.280]  Copenhagen global government event that is in deep trouble thank god but it didn't matter
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:51.760]  they're still implementing it at the local level you were finishing up a story about a nation you
[3:24:51.760 --> 3:25:02.160]  visited go ahead yes bangladesh that's the nation which is probably the most vulnerable to flooding
[3:25:02.160 --> 3:25:11.440]  disasters and cyclones all in relationship to the monsoon annual monsoonal changes so there we know
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:21.120]  from year to year that floods and it's a terrible loss of people and ipcc have claimed with the rising
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:26.560]  sea level it will be so disastrous that maybe hundreds of thousands of people will be killed
[3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:34.160]  and also maybe one fourth of the country will be simply wiped out some i have even said 90 percent
[3:25:34.800 --> 3:25:41.120]  so what is that is what they claim but what is the truth the truth is something completely
[3:25:41.120 --> 3:25:47.840]  different i have been in the Sunderban delta the delta is the most sensitive area first of all i
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:55.440]  learned that it has become more saline the fresh water has decreased so they say ah sea is rising
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:26:03.440]  however it's not at all rising it they have built a dam of ganges so of course less fresh water is
[3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:09.920]  coming out that's the only simple reason because why it's become more marine another area have been
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:17.360]  more affected by flooding so what have happened there is because they have cut down the mangrove
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:30.720]  forest to give place for shrimp pond and it was earlier 4945 hectare of mangrove swamp now it is
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:38.320]  150 hectare and so now the water can speed up yes so that but instead of saying ah we have
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:44.880]  done something stupid we shouldn't have done that they say ah it's the global sea level rise and we
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:52.800]  cannot do anything and the the west must pay us so i went out there and it was very rapidly i found
[3:26:52.800 --> 3:26:59.840]  an area where it has been it is a delta area the delta is usually built up in right to the mean sea
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:06.400]  level so in this delta first of all it was covered by a forest forest which is 50 years maybe 100
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:12.880]  years so it means that he had not continued to rise because otherwise the forest would have been
[3:27:12.880 --> 3:27:19.040]  underwater and it's not so that is the first thing but nobody have thought of that second it was a
[3:27:19.040 --> 3:27:28.000]  huge tremendous erosion huge part of the coast was gone and you could see in the in the shore
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:33.280]  lot of tree trunks was sticking out many people would say ah because there are tree trunks it's
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:41.280]  a forest it would be uh rise in sea level but those were mangrove trees and you could see the
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:50.400]  horizontal root system which tell you exactly that this where the mudflat was before the erosion
[3:27:50.400 --> 3:28:00.080]  and if you make that calculation sea level has not risen a centimeter maybe maybe maybe even
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:05.600]  gone a little yeah so they cut down the mangroves to put in shrimp farms there was some floods and
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:10.640]  there was some erosion because they put another place where i was it was right in the middle of the
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:17.840]  remaining mangrove forest an island which was facing the whole of the indian ocean so that was
[3:28:18.400 --> 3:28:23.520]  severely eroded and all the other people when they see erosion they say ah sea level rise
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:30.320]  but i could prove here by the trees again tree doesn't lie the horizontal roots of the trees
[3:28:30.320 --> 3:28:37.840]  we were 80 centimeters above the shore they would throw they showed you that the old mudflat was
[3:28:37.840 --> 3:28:44.640]  90 centimeters above the shore and that means exactly as in the forest so sea has not risen
[3:28:44.640 --> 3:28:51.520]  that's quite simple things but it tells you remarkable thing even in bangladesh there is no
[3:28:51.520 --> 3:28:56.800]  doctor here's the issue we know we know it's all a fraud you know they want a global government
[3:28:57.440 --> 3:29:02.720]  uh i mean when you do talk to other scientists they keep saying the majority of scientists think
[3:29:02.720 --> 3:29:08.160]  the earth is warming no even as they i mean that's another fraud just like polar bears can't swim
[3:29:08.160 --> 3:29:16.960]  right yes so for example we know that we have hundreds and hundreds we in in we have documents
[3:29:16.960 --> 3:29:26.240]  we were 1000 of people have signed but in the document we which we sent into Copenhagen it was
[3:29:26.240 --> 3:29:33.360]  141 scientists working working i'll tell you what doctor doctor we gotta break again do five more

[3:32:02.960 --> 3:32:08.000]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[3:32:08.000 --> 3:32:12.960]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much
[3:32:12.960 --> 3:32:18.240]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:23.360]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[3:32:23.360 --> 3:32:28.880]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[3:32:28.880 --> 3:32:34.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[3:32:34.080 --> 3:32:38.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[3:32:38.640 --> 3:32:43.120]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power
[3:32:43.120 --> 3:32:47.920]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information

[3:33:11.200 --> 3:33:20.160]  listen when you read the founding documents of the modern environmentalist they're a bunch of
[3:33:20.160 --> 3:33:27.760]  eugenicists period they want global one-child policies they want to control the world's resources
[3:33:27.760 --> 3:33:34.000]  they want a carbon dictatorship they know that humans from the numbers i've seen are like one
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:40.320]  two thousandths of the amount every year of carbon dioxide i mean it's ridiculous and we know
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:48.240]  it's been 20 times 14 times depending on the ice core samples in earth's history it's a trace gas
[3:33:48.240 --> 3:33:54.240]  that we need and i don't know how many Nobel prize winners and scientists i've got an interview here
[3:33:54.240 --> 3:34:00.480]  on the show to explain that to you it's a sick joke by george soros and the rockefellers in the
[3:34:00.480 --> 3:34:06.960]  un to put a tax on carbon dioxide it's asinine they know carbon dioxide rises after temperatures
[3:34:06.960 --> 3:34:12.000]  go up they know the hockey sticks of fraud they know that they're only showing you a small part
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:18.480]  of the graph you pull back from the graph there's the medieval warm period there's the warm period
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:25.520]  9 000 years ago during the bronze age that's why humans were able to develop and beef up our numbers
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:30.960]  the ice age is hard on life ice ages are hard on polar bears their numbers go way down during the
[3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:36.480]  ice age the the archaeologists have proven that and evidenced by the warming period the last 50
[3:34:36.480 --> 3:34:41.760]  years their numbers went up now their numbers may actually go down because it's getting cool again
[3:34:41.760 --> 3:34:48.080]  just like mars ice caps uh we're getting smaller now they're getting bigger again the last nine
[3:34:48.080 --> 3:34:54.560]  years because the sun as one of the big drivers has cooled off it may get hotter and it may get a
[3:34:54.560 --> 3:35:01.600]  lot hotter it may get colder we don't know we're on a planet in deep space orbiting a sun people
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:07.520]  may tell you that's a conspiracy theorist we are on a planet we do orbit a sun carbon dioxide is not
[3:35:07.520 --> 3:35:16.080]  poison i promise you are on a planet not al gore's delusional world i promise you penguins can swim
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:21.120]  they're the best aquatic swimming bird out there i promise you polar bears hunt in the water they're
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:29.040]  not all dying it's all lies we are on a planet polar bears can swim they're not dying now going
[3:35:29.040 --> 3:35:36.400]  back to close with dr niles axel mourner doctor is a top expert on this in your field before he
[3:35:36.400 --> 3:35:42.080]  retired the head of your university's two departments on this uh stockham university very
[3:35:42.080 --> 3:35:47.600]  prestigious there in sweden in closing you've been giving us lots of scientific proof it's a fraud
[3:35:47.600 --> 3:35:54.880]  but they don't care in your research why are these criminals engaged in systematic fraud as the
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:36:00.880]  un documents not just climate gate last week reveal the un is hiring them to engage in collectivist
[3:36:00.880 --> 3:36:06.720]  fraud they want to rule the world but but from your research doing battle with these criminals uh
[3:36:06.720 --> 3:36:13.120]  why are they doing this just you said it they were we want to control it and the thing that the
[3:36:13.120 --> 3:36:21.840]  first ipcc report set the so to say the train on the tracks and they have never changed anything
[3:36:21.840 --> 3:36:29.760]  though the more we study the more wrong they are and but they only make this this is a lobbying
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:38.560]  product in early days we could sell um shampoo or anything and it was allowed to have lobbyists
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:45.840]  to to to promote it but in science this has never been allowed science should always be
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:55.200]  evaluate from scientific uh merits this time this is no longer the case it has been totally left
[3:36:55.200 --> 3:37:04.640]  aside and those lobbyists have been able to carry it all the way to um the Copenhagen meeting
[3:37:04.640 --> 3:37:11.760]  and that is that is surprising and is remarkable and it's something which all forces have to work
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:19.120]  against them and there are too many scientists which knew far too well that this is not correct
[3:37:19.120 --> 3:37:23.920]  but they they choose to be silent because they didn't want to quarrel they didn't want to take
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:31.440]  their time and so on and they especially wanted to have their research grants uh going on that's
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:38.320]  what the emails show is that these are top top scientists who persecute anyone that doesn't
[3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:45.520]  follow their dogmas the last time we saw a fraud this big really had to be Hitler with a scientific
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:55.200]  fraud of eugenics yes that is a strong thing but it's coming the essence is about the same it's a
[3:37:55.200 --> 3:38:02.000]  way of wanting to control the word i which is an autocratic movement they want to do that and that's
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:08.320]  what why they to the begin with set up this intergovernmental panel of climate and nothing
[3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:14.480]  should be intergovernmental and then no one should control anything if we should all be
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:22.400]  free states and having our own um uh democratic judgment this is so strange but that's how it was
[3:38:22.400 --> 3:38:28.560]  once began and i i have written about that in a little book which i have the modest title the
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:33.440]  greatest lie ever told because i think really that's right tell us about your book tell us
[3:38:33.440 --> 3:38:38.240]  about your book doctor and tell us about any websites or anything you'd like to uh impart
[3:38:38.240 --> 3:38:44.640]  to the listeners i know you know this is this is a small book that we have which i launched
[3:38:44.640 --> 3:38:55.920]  uh 2007 and it's really printed into 2009 and it's a short it's a lot of pictures very little
[3:38:55.920 --> 3:39:01.200]  text because people cannot read any longer they need to see the evidence and it's a conspiracy
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:07.680]  theory that we can even read i mean if the media will tell the public that polar bears can't swim
[3:39:07.680 --> 3:39:12.800]  yeah when they spend most of their time as you know in the water hunting i mean yeah no no pretty
[3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:17.440]  soon they'll say reading never existed but but i mean most people don't even know we're on a planet
[3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:23.440]  doctor so so they think al gore gave birth to the earth but but go ahead yeah but this is the other
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:28.960]  it is more like joke it's so serious that that of course things are so utterly wrong with it
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:36.800]  with i am a scientist i must have respect for for for scientific way of working then we have the
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:44.800]  media far too much of the media has not taking their responsibility so many have just took
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:51.600]  just uh basonated out exactly the same thing without checking and um yeah i mean it's a fad
[3:39:51.600 --> 3:39:57.520]  they catch him up in a fad just like eugenics was the big fan scientific matter it's also a
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:03.920]  moralic matter i mean we have a long word is we don't behave like that lies should not be the
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:11.120]  the sir sir i get emails every day i get emails every day where this guy was putting up posters
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:19.760]  downtown for a for a for a for a uh nascar race yes and these beautiful women ran up screaming at
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:26.080]  him saying cars kill the earth you shouldn't do that and then i saw another post where a guy was
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:32.800]  putting up monster truck posters and women ran up so they have cult members just running around
[3:40:32.800 --> 3:40:42.480]  like zombies uh i mean how do we stop them i don't know i think now maybe the more and more are
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:49.600]  revealed of this let us call it the iceberg of shame the the little thing which is sticking
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:56.160]  up is the east anglia and all those things which are beneath more and more is revealed and from that
[3:40:56.160 --> 3:41:03.440]  the facts must stop it that's the only thing i like i like i like facts i believe in facts
[3:41:03.440 --> 3:41:12.000]  but there is also uh in a little thing i wrote nearly recently i quoted sex being a hamlet
[3:41:13.040 --> 3:41:20.880]  there is something rotten in the state of danmark yeah and what is rotten is just exactly what is
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:30.400]  now going on in the bella center where they have the meeting on climate well said sir so you've
[3:41:30.400 --> 3:41:34.240]  done a lot of writing and written a book tell us where we can read your writings or get the book
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:43.760]  probably to to make contact with me and then i should advise you and find the find the
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:47.280]  appropriate sure sure i mean i mean we have listeners in sweden too we're the number one
[3:41:47.280 --> 3:41:51.440]  internet radio show we're also an am and evan but we are number one globally on the internet
[3:41:52.160 --> 3:41:57.760]  so fire out your contact i mean is there a public contact doctor i have in my email
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:42:08.960]  is the best one give us your email sir that mourner at p o giant dot n u and and do you
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:15.600]  put the umlau for whatever over the oh no no no they in e you should know that the umlau is in
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:22.240]  german normal okay well well this internet printout had it yeah i don't know that sir i can't keep
[3:42:22.240 --> 3:42:27.840]  track of all the all the are you kidding i'm from texas some say we don't even really speak english
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:35.760]  down here we live in caves i am authentic hillbilly no i don't think so at all because this is also
[3:42:35.760 --> 3:42:40.640]  another thing which is said that the scientists should do something about it the media should
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:47.520]  do something and then when we have all those wonderful uh normal people which have something
[3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:55.280]  which is so important and that is common sense common sense if they just use it they will see
[3:42:55.280 --> 3:42:59.840]  that there is something rotten in the state of danmark okay give us that email again one more
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:16.240]  time sir uh mourner m o n e r and m like my name and then uh at n p o giant okay and and you all right
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:21.680]  sir well it's great talking to you uh i hope you haven't been persecuted too bad by these people
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:27.200]  they've they've got a lot of bad i have been very much but it doesn't it doesn't work it does
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:34.160]  oh so they did persecute you in many ways but i'm i'm i'm stronger yeah that only makes you
[3:43:34.160 --> 3:43:40.480]  want to fight harder doesn't it try and i get a little extra minute they get an extra minute
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:49.040]  which they wouldn't have liked to have so it's easy to easy to talk about these things because i
[3:43:49.040 --> 3:43:55.280]  happen to know the subject and they are they don't know it they are they are just fighting for
[3:43:55.280 --> 3:44:00.560]  something which they have all have well what they really want is to move into our houses and
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:05.280]  control our children i mean i i mean these really are the most go that far but i mean
[3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:12.400]  it no no no they're a guild of control freaks no no it's enough so much yes and and they of
[3:44:12.400 --> 3:44:21.200]  course if they set up this strong government governmental thing that will be very bad well
[3:44:21.200 --> 3:44:27.280]  well doctor doctor when i say they want our children i'm sure you heard the chinese delegation
[3:44:27.280 --> 3:44:31.360]  called for a global one-child policy and so have newspapers all over the west
[3:44:32.160 --> 3:44:38.480]  okay yes in some way yeah yeah very very very disgusting well thank you so much doctor it was
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:44.800]  great having you on with us thank you and all the people listening please go on thinking use your head

[3:44:49.840 --> 3:44:55.200]  well i don't know how anyone couldn't just listen to al gore and know that guy's a liar
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:45:01.040]  i mean if i saw that guy walking towards me in an alley i'd run if i saw al gore at a used car lot
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:05.840]  i was trying to buy a car i would just like i mean he is he is quite a creature thank you
[3:45:05.840 --> 3:45:14.400]  so much sir yep all right there he goes ladies and gentlemen character in his own right okay i'm

[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:43.440]  smoking currently the main thing is i stay away from people who are smoking cigarettes because i
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:48.080]  a lot of people quit smoking and then say they never want them again not me i mean i'm thinking
[3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:52.640]  about a cigarette just a minute ago when i was drinking coffee you got to stay away from alcohol
[3:54:52.640 --> 3:54:58.320]  and other people who smoke cigarettes uh the two go hand in glove for me i mean it's different
[3:54:58.320 --> 3:55:03.600]  you just think about your kids and how you don't want to die on them and you just decided i mean
[3:55:03.600 --> 3:55:09.760]  but my problem is i'll go six months without smoking and then i tend to go back on for a month or two
[3:55:09.760 --> 3:55:14.720]  and then i go man this gives me a headache i feel like crap and i go back off of it but i i i got
[3:55:14.720 --> 3:55:20.160]  to move quick here anything else sir uh no i was just uh i quit with the electric cigarette from

[3:55:38.800 --> 3:55:45.440]  demetrius in new hampshire demetrius you're on the air go ahead yes how are you sir good buddy
[3:55:46.640 --> 3:55:50.000]  uh i just wanted to tell you that i've been listening to you for about two years and i've
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:57.360]  been uh reading about the new world order myself uh and the way that i got uh informed about it
[3:55:57.360 --> 3:56:01.520]  was kind of from the book of revelation uh a lot of stuff that you read the book of revelation
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:05.760]  seems to coincide with what's going on right now but now it's all in there it's 10 times
[3:56:05.760 --> 3:56:11.440]  stronger than nostradamus nostradamus was all vague about everything it was pure baloney
[3:56:11.440 --> 3:56:16.400]  you read revelation a world government where everybody can watch the guy on television at once
[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:22.160]  and you've got to do it or or or he kills you and there's a mark in the face in the hand
[3:56:22.800 --> 3:56:30.160]  and and it describes just like giant wasp dropping bombs on people you know that i mean look at jet
[3:56:30.160 --> 3:56:35.680]  aircraft look at helicopters i mean it's it's pretty wild stuff it is it is wild stuff i have
[3:56:35.680 --> 3:56:42.000]  actually visited the cave of uh the cave where the uh book of revelation was written uh in uh
[3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:48.400]  pat most home country which is originally greece but uh what i want to ask you is how can i make
[3:56:48.400 --> 3:56:52.800]  a career out of exposing the new world order i have a bachelor's degree in politics uh i've
[3:56:52.800 --> 3:56:57.920]  kind of been disillusioned by watching the lemmings go on about their daily business every day the
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:02.880]  shallowness of it all and i just don't want to hear the deal here's the deal don't expect you're
[3:57:02.880 --> 3:57:08.160]  going to be able to make a living immediately throw all your passion work your regular job
[3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:15.520]  then five hours a day write blogs get a video camera make your own film uh put it out uh and
[3:57:15.520 --> 3:57:20.880]  then say hey do you like my film buy a dvd if not here it is on the web and do it it took me years
[3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:27.200]  and years it took me actually not that long took me about four or five years to get self-sufficient
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:31.920]  and then it's just been incremental from there to expand hire more people expand the operation
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:39.440]  but just uh pick the issues you want to go out there and and write a book self publish it whatever
[3:57:39.440 --> 3:57:43.920]  and if you've got the insight and the ideas that people are into you'll be effective i appreciate
[3:57:43.920 --> 3:57:50.000]  your call demetrius jim in illinois last caller sorry to michael go ahead jim yeah i just want
[3:57:50.000 --> 3:57:56.080]  to get the word out in case of crap ever hits the fan up in chicago what might be uh part of the
[3:57:56.080 --> 3:58:04.640]  problem uh a while back i've seen a uh gel a bell jet star which spray boom sticking out of its
[3:58:04.640 --> 3:58:11.680]  sides hovering over a police facility on the south side of chicago that shouldn't be in this area
[3:58:12.800 --> 3:58:18.400]  and uh you could take it from there what that would be capable of doing i reported this to the
[3:58:18.400 --> 3:58:26.320]  police superintendent so it's on public record that uh it has been noticed well i mean look it was
[3:58:26.320 --> 3:58:33.120]  declassified 10 years ago that every major city has helicopters in bays with knockout gas and nerve
[3:58:33.120 --> 3:58:38.480]  gas ready to just kill everybody or knock everybody out i mean this government's criminal folks
