[00:00.000 --> 00:26.680]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.680 --> 00:33.080]  Dr. Darren J. Beattie will be joining us with major breaking news concerning the false flag
[00:33.080 --> 00:40.920]  provocateur event that was January 6th and how the deep state is attempting to use that
[00:40.920 --> 00:50.880]  event as the pretext to trigger a open purge of loyal good Americans and use a civil war
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.840]  they will then trigger and they will actually carry out a tax against themselves a full
[00:55.840 --> 01:09.080]  spectrum dominance operation that they believe will deliver them victory over this country
[01:09.080 --> 01:13.440]  and then the world because we can capture the United States you're able to capture the
[01:13.440 --> 01:20.400]  world this is all about global domination and the globalists run in the country are
[01:20.400 --> 01:25.480]  again amongst the very nastiest people on the planet a lot of incredible information
[01:25.480 --> 01:31.640]  has come out in the gisling Maxwell pedophile trial and I got to some of that yesterday
[01:31.640 --> 01:35.880]  and I forgot to tell the crew to pull that out of the strata of your state stack and
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.520]  I've also got all the new news that is coming out of that trial but there's not a lot because
[01:40.520 --> 01:46.440]  they're trying to suppress it but what is coming out is just confirming just how horrible
[01:46.440 --> 01:53.320]  and bad this whole system was and how the criminal corporate deep state uses sex crimes
[01:53.320 --> 02:01.720]  against children as the filthy glue that holds this whole house of cards together so that
[02:01.720 --> 02:11.160]  is coming up at the bottom of the hour we will be detailing it Mr. Beatty will be joining
[02:11.160 --> 02:17.480]  us Professor Beatty on the former advisors of President Trump in the second hour today
[02:17.480 --> 02:24.640]  and then things got so busy in the last week that I never released part two of the general
[02:24.640 --> 02:32.440]  Flynn interview that's just as powerful as part one and the part two we also interview
[02:32.440 --> 02:41.760]  Patrick Berg and General Flynn's very articulate smart brother Joe Flynn filmmaker and more
[02:41.760 --> 02:54.400]  so that is all coming up in the third hour today and Owen shroyer as well I have been
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.440]  hit with just such epiphanies of how crystal clear all these things are now and we have
[02:59.440 --> 03:04.920]  all the documents that early this morning doing some research and then later driving
[03:04.920 --> 03:13.240]  into work I just sat back and saw their whole plan so crystal clear and a lot of this we
[03:13.240 --> 03:17.320]  have already covered but man this is just horrible this is absolutely horrible and once the
[03:17.320 --> 03:25.160]  eye of Sauron is upon you you're either going to push it back and stop it and vanquish it
[03:25.160 --> 03:30.640]  or it's going to destroy you I mean this is a death battle the end they're never going
[03:30.640 --> 03:36.640]  to stop until they've shut this show down and put me in prison there's there's no doubt
[03:36.640 --> 03:41.000]  about that and I don't feel sorry for myself for that going on it just makes me really
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.680]  be concerned for the country in the world because they are literally trying to take
[03:45.680 --> 03:49.680]  me off the air to get to you as Trump always says they're coming after me because they
[03:49.680 --> 03:54.320]  want to get to you and they are just absolutely out to get you because your ancestors were
[03:54.320 --> 04:01.560]  Christian even if you aren't Christian get to understand this is this is spiritual and
[04:01.560 --> 04:07.600]  the birthright this country has and that's why I've got to get to all the news it's
[04:07.600 --> 04:12.080]  on the plate today but also talk about the big picture here but the fact that the energy
[04:12.080 --> 04:26.720]  secretary is just a PR front person and she said a few weeks ago that oh it's a good thing
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.360]  we're raising your gas prices and then now she says oh no we're not the ones doing it
[04:31.360 --> 04:38.520]  it's just incredible I mean these criminals know exactly what they're doing so we'll look
[04:38.520 --> 04:45.480]  at that as well and more today this is a big broadcast last day before such an important
[04:45.480 --> 04:51.720]  Christian holiday that the Satanist hate Thanksgiving but I give thanks to all of you and your
[04:51.720 --> 05:00.120]  support in our brotherhood and sisterhood that we have together we are family info wars
[05:00.120 --> 05:07.120]  get there are so many crappy brands of energy products energy drinks energy powders energy
[05:07.120 --> 05:13.840]  pills and look almost all of them work but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides
[05:13.840 --> 05:21.400]  horrible crashes and again so many toxins and all of the new tropic products that we
[05:21.400 --> 05:28.760]  sell at info wars tour dot com are clean are pure are highest quality and they're long lasting
[05:28.760 --> 05:34.000]  and they help focus your mind and right now our strongest product the three tropics we

[05:57.640 --> 06:07.760]  available right now and it funds the info war a 360 win you thought the lead in winter
[06:07.760 --> 06:15.960]  would bring you down forever but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun from
[06:15.960 --> 06:27.800]  the front lines of the information war it's alex jones you know when dylan roose went
[06:27.800 --> 06:36.360]  into a church in south carolina and shot and killed nine innocent black worshipers i hated
[06:36.360 --> 06:42.160]  him i was disgusted by him but then when the media blamed me and said it's because i get
[06:42.160 --> 06:48.680]  white people are just evil in general it made me really disgusted by those monsters aiding
[06:48.680 --> 06:54.760]  and abetting the hate that that young man was involved in and helping that blossom and
[06:54.760 --> 07:01.160]  grow so that there would be more racial attacks on white people and vice versa getting a civil
[07:01.160 --> 07:08.120]  war started but then last night in this morning i was thinking about cnn and msnbc and abc
[07:08.120 --> 07:15.400]  and npr and the new york times and the washington post and every other bbc you name it all up
[07:15.400 --> 07:23.920]  there working so hard to cover up what darrell e brooks did who drove zigzag trying to hit
[07:23.920 --> 07:29.560]  as many people as he could like it was a video game who ran over children another of which
[07:29.560 --> 07:36.280]  died last night little boy and then all his postings about somebody needs to start killing
[07:36.280 --> 07:41.320]  white people and and whites are inherently evil and his support of the democratic party
[07:41.320 --> 07:48.680]  and blm and to have them cover that up makes them accomplices to the murder do you understand
[07:48.680 --> 07:54.040]  that if somebody murders people your neighbor let's say murders their wife and you try to
[07:54.040 --> 07:59.200]  cover it up to the police and say oh i saw it was an accident she slipped down the stairs
[07:59.200 --> 08:03.960]  he didn't bash her brains out like the police say and you're lying about that you now are
[08:03.960 --> 08:12.480]  an accomplice to the murder after the fact because you're covering it up that's in law
[08:12.480 --> 08:18.760]  if you know your neighbor is shooting child porn and you help cover it up you're now an
[08:18.760 --> 08:24.960]  accomplice to child porn so the funny thing was i wasn't talking about this this morning
[08:24.960 --> 08:27.880]  and i went for a hike with my son who came over and visited he had lived with me he's
[08:27.880 --> 08:32.840]  19 went for a hike early morning got back my wife was up making breakfast for my a four
[08:32.840 --> 08:42.040]  year old daughter and i'm sitting there drinking coffee at about 7 30 in the morning looking
[08:42.040 --> 08:48.240]  at my four year old daughter drink orange juice and my son had just left to go back
[08:48.240 --> 08:57.360]  to his house and i'm sitting there and i'm thinking about how sick it makes me that we
[08:57.360 --> 09:02.600]  live in a country where we've allowed these type of criminal organizations to sit up there
[09:02.600 --> 09:08.560]  and and and foment and say whites are inherently evil and cover up all the black on white crime
[09:08.560 --> 09:15.040]  that's used to be 10 on 10 to 1 black on white now it's over 20 to 1 in many cities and and
[09:15.040 --> 09:21.440]  growing and so sad because that rips communities apart but it is a minority of black people
[09:21.440 --> 09:27.160]  that are literally on like a g hot against whites and it's all psychological warfare
[09:27.160 --> 09:34.160]  it's all psychological pro programming and it's a manipulation of the weak minded and
[09:34.160 --> 09:38.640]  you have the culture and just the evil and the darkness and the drugs and and just what's
[09:38.640 --> 09:46.720]  going on and it's scary for everybody because this is being done by design and it's in the
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.560]  wiki leaks hillary talking to the head of a university psychology department about how
[09:51.560 --> 09:59.640]  they've got to intensify the culture wars to divide the country to control them because
[09:59.640 --> 10:05.440]  poor people want a better life and she's like yeah these damn poor people member these stupid
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.240]  baristas what do we do they want a better life well just intensify culture war so they're
[10:11.240 --> 10:17.320]  all fighting with each other that's in the stinking emails and we sit there like fools
[10:17.320 --> 10:26.760]  and watch this unfold so that's their plan and that's what they do and I was sitting
[10:26.760 --> 10:33.880]  there thinking about how sick this makes me and my wife comes over and starts putting
[10:33.880 --> 10:40.160]  food on my daughter's plate and then she burst into tears and sits down and starts sobbing
[10:40.160 --> 10:45.760]  like I've never seen her cry and I've been with her seven years girlfriend I met during
[10:45.760 --> 10:52.840]  my divorce you know after got married and had a child with her and I said what's wrong
[10:52.840 --> 10:57.200]  with somebody died you just hear families what the hell's going on she goes it's the
[10:57.200 --> 11:04.440]  children of why would you run over children and she's just retching and pouring crying
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.720]  and then she grabs my four-year-old daughter goes no one I don't want to hurt you and that
[11:08.720 --> 11:14.440]  was a normal response of a woman knowing the psychotic killers running around killing people
[11:14.440 --> 11:19.800]  because of what color they are because a four-year-old little girl or a five-year-old little boy
[11:19.800 --> 11:23.240]  whether they've got brown skin or white skin or whatever color skin they got they don't
[11:23.240 --> 11:29.640]  deserve some drugged up devil worshipper and that's what this is to run around selfishly
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.160]  acting all cool playing their gangster rap running over the white devils to you know
[11:34.160 --> 11:42.840]  get some in on written house the white supremacist and so Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and all the
[11:42.840 --> 11:48.360]  MSNBC hosts and the CNN hosts every one of them is your enemy every one of them hates
[11:48.360 --> 11:52.840]  your guts every one of them is part of a criminal globalist cabal along with the Democratic
[11:52.840 --> 12:01.360]  Party and the Justice Department and the lawyers and just all of them their trash their scum
[12:01.360 --> 12:06.080]  using psychological warfare to do this and then to cover up what this guy did because
[12:06.080 --> 12:14.640]  if we use this example of what not to do it created some shame in the hearts of evil haters
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.880]  whether it's a black guy killing white people or a white guy killing black people then this
[12:18.880 --> 12:25.720]  would stop but they don't do that just like with school shootings they hype every school
[12:25.720 --> 12:29.880]  shooting up and give incredible attention to killers knowing that it's going to create
[12:29.880 --> 12:35.240]  copycats and in all the Democratic jurisdictions they they cover up people planning the shootings
[12:35.240 --> 12:40.320]  they protect people planning the shootings hell the Walmart shooting in Texas and others
[12:40.320 --> 12:45.240]  it turned out were leftist in almost every case it's black trench coats devil worshipers
[12:45.240 --> 12:50.360]  people into death instead of committing suicide they don't commit suicide by cop they don't
[12:50.360 --> 12:58.360]  commit suicide it's another option now it's go out and just kill some people at Walmart
[12:58.360 --> 13:02.720]  and the media sits there and then misappropriates it almost every time and say well they were
[13:02.720 --> 13:09.680]  white so they did it too because they were racist and then it turns out it's the opposite
[13:09.680 --> 13:15.640]  they're just a devil worship or they're a antifa but then when it's cut and dry a black
[13:15.640 --> 13:23.520]  supremacist crazy person who goes out in zigzags through a town parade they have where the middle
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.040]  schoolers and elementary students and everybody can go out and run around and be recognized
[13:28.040 --> 13:35.320]  by the town and have fun and get their adrenaline up and just have a event but here's this guy
[13:35.320 --> 13:41.000]  programmed to tribal thought hey there's that town that's mainly white 20 miles away I'll
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.400]  drive out of Kenosha I'll drive out of Milwaukee and I'll go over there and I'll just run my
[13:45.400 --> 13:50.000]  car through a bunch of people and and and when I do it when I kill six people injured
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.480]  over 40 they say more probably gonna die some are brain dead he's a hero he's a good man
[13:56.480 --> 14:00.160]  the left settle over Twitter well this will teach you white people and it was mainly
[14:00.160 --> 14:07.160]  weird white professor types programming who know exactly what they're doing even though
[14:07.160 --> 14:12.520]  it'll come back on them so they're planning the launch of civil war in this country and
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.440]  they're planning to brand January 6 as a premeditated attack on the Capitol by myself and Trump
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.160]  so they can try to arrest me in the near future so they can then detonate bombs around the
[14:22.160 --> 14:26.520]  country and claim that it's the resistance doing it when it's going to be them to roll
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.360]  out full on martial law they've just gotten started with the COVID martial law and got
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.800]  that idea introduced this is what they're going to do in the next 10 and a half months
[14:35.800 --> 14:39.720]  before the midterms they're going to end the country because they know they've lost the
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.160]  public the public's coming together black lives matter has a 20% approval rating the
[14:44.160 --> 14:49.120]  Democrats have a 30% approval rating they're the occupying foreign evil force and all they've
[14:49.120 --> 14:56.480]  got is race war left as the cover for martial law so no one should be violent no one should
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.600]  go out and offensively attack anybody and anytime you see one of these events you're
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.800]  going to need to go out and document it knowing that it might be your footage that gets the
[15:05.800 --> 15:09.320]  truth out of what happened because if there wasn't all the footage of this they would
[15:09.320 --> 15:14.200]  say a white supremacist attacked that crowd and they would say the victims were black
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.720]  in the UK and in Germany when Muslims and others attack and kill Europeans they will
[15:19.720 --> 15:25.080]  say and lie on the news and say it was a German or say it was a Brit that's the next level
[15:25.080 --> 15:29.560]  of this because they want to keep those groups stirred up and angry and attacking because
[15:29.560 --> 15:33.720]  they can use them anytime they want with the media to snap the fingers and have a mostly
[15:33.720 --> 15:38.240]  peaceful protest where major cities burn down and people get killed and who leads it white
[15:38.240 --> 15:44.360]  people in black uniforms with their faces covered out stirring up the inner city crowds
[15:44.360 --> 15:49.160]  we even got the IMF World Bank documents on that and the Soros documents five years ago
[15:49.160 --> 15:54.360]  where they actually plan that with the local police in blue cities they control so this
[15:54.360 --> 16:00.160]  is it we'll be right back stay with us if you're concerned about the power grid info

[18:02.480 --> 18:07.080]  I want to explain something that is absolutely seed understanding our world it's very very
[18:07.080 --> 18:13.080]  simple but the most people don't know the privately owned central banks of the world
[18:13.080 --> 18:18.960]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and
[18:18.960 --> 18:26.760]  using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual property energy they're using it to buy people
[18:26.760 --> 18:32.600]  to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could
[18:32.600 --> 18:36.920]  leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.480]  circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and
[18:41.480 --> 18:47.200]  are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies
[18:47.200 --> 18:52.840]  operate but to actually shut them down and force a collapse of civilization making the
[18:52.840 --> 18:57.240]  companies they do fund the only things left standing this is the great reset this is what's
[18:57.240 --> 19:00.720]  happening now warn everyone it's the only way to stop it.
[19:00.720 --> 19:07.920]  In late August info wars saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[19:07.920 --> 19:14.320]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[19:14.320 --> 19:19.520]  and financial collapse worldwide now ladies and gentlemen storeable food has always been
[19:19.520 --> 19:23.240]  something that's important to have it's a check box that everybody needs to have taking
[19:23.240 --> 19:28.680]  care of right along with water filtration self defense and a relationship with God but now

[19:58.080 --> 20:05.080]  now at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:28.080 --> 20:37.200]  all right in the second hour i'm going to get more into what i was just covering with
[20:37.200 --> 20:44.680]  dr darin beady who's been at the center of pecker carlson's in-depth investigation into
[20:44.680 --> 20:51.680]  the provocateur deep state actions on january 6 and that false flag event that was triggered
[20:51.680 --> 20:56.960]  but misfired it was meant to be at least 50 times to 100 times worse so they already
[20:56.960 --> 21:00.640]  had their scripts ready about this is as bad as pearl harbor this is terrible they tried
[21:00.640 --> 21:04.560]  to trick cue people under federal command that they were actually under cues command
[21:04.560 --> 21:08.240]  the president's command to actually go in with weapons but they didn't do it and to
[21:08.240 --> 21:12.400]  actually attack members of congress but they didn't do it and that's why the feds have
[21:12.400 --> 21:18.480]  dropped at the low level the official story that it was commanded by trump and myself
[21:18.480 --> 21:22.920]  is because they know the investigation continues into a higher level group it's going to run
[21:22.920 --> 21:29.040]  right into the fbi running and the same fbi agents that ran the attack on governor whitmer
[21:29.040 --> 21:32.840]  and that whole stage event were also brought in to run this one and we know their names
[21:32.840 --> 21:40.320]  we know who they are so i'm risking my life exposing all this because i can't be a coward
[21:40.320 --> 21:44.520]  but you know they've subpoenaed myself and rogers so they can then say oh you lied in
[21:44.520 --> 21:49.280]  your responses you're going to jail and they will indict us in dc with a kangaroo court
[21:49.280 --> 21:55.680]  that has the same value as north korea so that's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.080]  and people say well you should need to back off you know look at you you stood up to evil
[22:00.080 --> 22:06.120]  what's coming after you you know god's real and god's watching on that too i'm afraid
[22:06.120 --> 22:11.760]  of and i did some bad things when i was younger and so i get put in prison or i get killed
[22:11.760 --> 22:18.160]  fighting evil hopefully that takes the dark mark the evil mark off of me and i can be
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.560]  with god in the future so i'm not worried about these fake judges and the corrupt fbi
[22:22.560 --> 22:29.080]  they got god to deal with too because believe me god's real god's 100 real and you better
[22:29.080 --> 22:33.000]  get your relationship right with god because that's what this is all about people say how
[22:33.000 --> 22:38.320]  are you handling all these attacks and all the things i expected to be attacked every
[22:38.320 --> 22:42.800]  day i'm not in prison or pushing up days is a good day as they say but i'm not going
[22:42.800 --> 22:49.920]  to do things that appease the system so i could sit there in some mansion on the beach somewhere
[22:49.920 --> 22:55.680]  and have some plastic wife and fake friends and and be part of this evil it's empty my
[22:55.680 --> 23:03.240]  life is so incredibly full being real everything food just tastes so much better music sounds
[23:03.240 --> 23:10.880]  better everything is just so much more intense because i'm walking with god and that doesn't
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.160]  mean i'm up here on some high horse like some holy man i'm telling you listen to me i walk
[23:15.160 --> 23:23.360]  with god i mean i i have got discernment now i have understanding i have been read in to
[23:23.360 --> 23:30.480]  the higher order at a low level but i i can see the steps now up to the white throne and
[23:30.480 --> 23:37.920]  i want to be on my knees before it i want to be beside god i want to be there under the
[23:37.920 --> 23:44.680]  fire of god's glory and strength like jimmy hendrick says let me stand next to your fire
[23:44.680 --> 23:49.800]  i don't want to be in hell with the fire of evil i want to be with god and the fire of
[23:49.800 --> 23:53.760]  love and justice and completion i'm sorry i'm preaching but there are no atheists and
[23:53.760 --> 24:01.240]  foxholes and make no mistake it is our children that are under the attack foutsies back on
[24:01.240 --> 24:05.320]  the news saying we're going to start injecting newborn babies as early as the first quarter
[24:05.320 --> 24:10.160]  that's two months away that's less than two months away they're making their move for
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.880]  our children and he fricking licks his lips when he talks about it and he's so damn evil
[24:14.880 --> 24:23.400]  and the the cover matches the interior that guy just is hitler 2.0 man and you notice
[24:23.400 --> 24:28.960]  that's why they they they radicalize and make everything race and people that work for the
[24:28.960 --> 24:32.960]  corporate medias to be so ashamed of themselves and and the people that serve this system
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.640]  are just absolutely cut off from god i mean you people are crazy but again you you you
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.360]  never figured out that there's a good side you just serve evil and you want to be at
[24:43.360 --> 24:49.440]  the top of the charts and the heavyweight champions of being bad so you got the big
[24:49.440 --> 24:57.760]  guy to deal with i'm gonna stop right there when i read the media and i see the national
[24:57.760 --> 25:01.720]  news i mean i've got dozens of clips here you've seen them where they are like oh these
[25:01.720 --> 25:05.760]  an accident he just came off the side of the highway and accidentally did this and chuck
[25:05.760 --> 25:08.880]  your shimmers like well the democrats passed an infrastructure bill this won't happen
[25:08.880 --> 25:15.960]  once we've got these racist roads dealt with he actually said that imagine the implication
[25:15.960 --> 25:21.800]  oh this black man didn't know how to drive a car and so that's why he came off the highway
[25:21.800 --> 25:29.480]  and ran everybody over oh no that was the black lives matter earlier this year in seattle
[25:29.480 --> 25:35.320]  or was it late last year when hundreds of people ran out at 1 a.m. onto the highway in front
[25:35.320 --> 25:40.160]  of drivers and by the grace of god it was a black driver i feel sorry for him running
[25:40.160 --> 25:45.200]  over people that ran in front of his car like dear do or you know geese will fly in front
[25:45.200 --> 25:50.200]  of your car to buzzards and i i've had a buzzard flying in my car and break the windshield
[25:50.200 --> 25:54.160]  back when i worked on a ranch the point is is that oh my god a white person killed him
[25:54.160 --> 25:57.480]  oh my god because they were all up there trying to get hit by cars basically so they could
[25:57.480 --> 26:02.560]  say oh it's a replay of charlottesville and oh my god all white people are to blame for
[26:02.560 --> 26:07.400]  one woman dying at charlottesville on and on and on now they've run over 40 plus people
[26:07.400 --> 26:13.400]  six of them have died another little boys died and we get to hear all over the news
[26:13.400 --> 26:24.760]  oh it was the it was the vehicle crash it was the car crash it was the suv crash
[26:24.760 --> 26:31.040]  he was really bizarre he shared hitler memes he that's a weird thing about the super left
[26:31.040 --> 26:34.680]  too they look like a weird hitler fetish these are their pedophiles he said he was a pedophile
[26:34.680 --> 26:41.400]  he wasn't convicted sex trafficker but daryl brooks daryl e brooks now the police are
[26:41.400 --> 26:45.960]  reporting that they had the video he zigzagged oh but we're not going to see the video of
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.320]  the up close oh it's charlottesville when the car crashes into people all the photos it's
[26:50.320 --> 26:53.920]  all over the news it's everywhere but in this case we don't humanize the little kids he
[26:53.920 --> 26:57.720]  ran over people he zigzagged through no no no and it gets worse we'll show you these
[26:57.720 --> 27:04.920]  photos coming up they've lightened his face on cnn and the washington post where he's
[27:04.920 --> 27:11.960]  wider than porcelain they actually put a filter on the mugshot to subliminally again say it's
[27:11.960 --> 27:19.120]  a white person doing it the let the other it is on screen again it'd be like if the
[27:19.120 --> 27:23.160]  white guy goes in and shoots the poor black people in south carolina at the church and
[27:23.160 --> 27:29.080]  then you say a black dude did it it's the same level of lying but it shouldn't matter
[27:29.080 --> 27:33.760]  it's a crazy bad evil person that did this and we say it's wrong and we try to stop it
[27:33.760 --> 27:38.560]  in the future but in europe it happens so much they in all the major meeting places in town
[27:38.560 --> 27:44.800]  square as they put up the freedom barricades because of these people attacking so it's
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.760]  hard to look at the victims because it humanizes them and hurts my heart but walk a shop christmas

[33:24.240 --> 33:36.000]  got something for me something you call love but confess you've been a messing where you
[33:36.000 --> 33:46.720]  shouldn't have been a messing and now someone else is getting all your best these boots are made
[33:46.720 --> 33:55.600]  for walking and that's just what they'll do one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over
[33:55.600 --> 34:16.160]  you yeah you keep lying when you ought to be true and you keep losing when you ought to not
[34:16.160 --> 34:26.960]  bet you keep saying it when you ought to be changing now what's right is right but you ain't
[34:26.960 --> 34:37.120]  been right yet these boots are made for walking and that's just what they and that's what daryl e brooks
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.240]  thought he thought well this evil white supremacist you know just killed three black people that's
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.840]  what mainstream news says call right now so i've got to go out and strike back well there's a
[34:47.840 --> 34:53.760]  predominantly white suburb close to here let me go kill him that's what he said all over the
[34:53.760 --> 35:00.640]  internet so he said why don't cowards just go kill these people and again that's the same
[35:00.640 --> 35:05.360]  evil spirit that was in dylan roof when he went into a black church people didn't even know they've
[35:05.360 --> 35:12.160]  done nothing to him and he killed nine innocent black people i mean if he hates black people so bad
[35:12.160 --> 35:16.960]  why did he go find like black pedophiles or black criminals or people that had done something wrong
[35:16.960 --> 35:22.000]  if he hates black so much you know no no it's got to be it's got to be black church goers worshiping
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.440]  jesus it's an evil spirit folks that hates christians and it just happened again you've got a brown
[35:29.440 --> 35:36.400]  skin demon doing what a white skin demon did you look at that demon mentally ill demon and then
[35:36.400 --> 35:45.280]  going to a parade and running over elementary and middle school kids oh that's real real manly right
[35:45.280 --> 35:54.400]  there i mean it's hard to top shooting nine adults at church just because they're black and christian
[35:54.400 --> 36:02.720]  but this guy wants to kill kids and he tells you in videos yeah i'm a pedophile big deal i pimp out
[36:02.720 --> 36:11.680]  little kids what's up with that he thinks being exploitive is powerful he thinks sex trafficking
[36:11.680 --> 36:16.080]  people's cool and you know what biden agrees with him because that's who these people are psychic
[36:16.080 --> 36:24.080]  vampires they are a pedophile army and they got pink skin and they got brown skin and they got black
[36:24.080 --> 36:32.480]  skin and they got yellow skin but they all got the devil inside like those old chips you say intel
[36:32.480 --> 36:40.640]  inside or you know no no no devil inside devil inside devil inside every single one of us has
[36:40.640 --> 36:45.920]  the devil inside yeah and that's why you want to get it out of your life and and push it down as
[36:45.920 --> 36:52.400]  small as you can get it instead of letting it grow grow grow grow grow grow grow grow grow grow
[36:52.400 --> 36:58.640]  until you destroy yourself and a bunch of other people and everything you know the symbol of the
[36:58.640 --> 37:05.680]  cornucopia is is is a plenty and and bounty and so it's a symbol of thanksgiving it's an old greek
[37:05.680 --> 37:14.160]  symbol but it it it moves in as a symbol of the bounty well what comes out of claus swab and the
[37:14.160 --> 37:19.360]  new world order in bill gates you'll have nothing you'll own nothing you'll eat bugs and you'll drink
[37:19.360 --> 37:24.560]  sewage water and you'll live in big ugly government housing buildings where they can control you and
[37:24.560 --> 37:30.480]  dumb you down and force feed you murder music and ship drugs in so you all kill each other
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.880]  and that very same group that took the black community that had a lower illegitimacy rate
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.080]  60 years ago than whites and now has the highest illegitimacy rate in the world that's scientific
[37:44.080 --> 37:49.920]  control because the black folks you know nichi said that which does not kill you only makes you
[37:49.920 --> 37:56.240]  stronger so i don't defend segregation or or any of that but black folks understood this is about
[37:56.240 --> 38:02.480]  a class thing if we get our own businesses and our own money and and and dress nice and and
[38:03.120 --> 38:10.800]  believe in ourselves we defeat people saying that we're inferior which was a minority of white people
[38:10.800 --> 38:17.200]  but it was still the system still in place it's hard to change that system now what are black
[38:17.200 --> 38:22.080]  people like the on average with the type of gangster stuff you see people to put these crimes
[38:22.080 --> 38:28.640]  the opposite of what black people were 60 70 years ago the polar opposite and the media did it and
[38:28.640 --> 38:34.480]  now the media is promoting that culture that is not black culture that is not american culture
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.240]  with callin cappernick showing a bunch of black men saying they're all slaves because they're in the

[47:22.000 --> 47:24.960]  operation lockstep program and i've been desperately warning you was imminent
[47:26.240 --> 47:32.640]  and so now next hour i'm gonna tell you what's imminent again it's race war they've been desperately
[47:32.640 --> 47:40.560]  trying to trigger it there is a way to stop it we can do it together if you recognize the enemy is
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.480]  the new world order it is the corporate media they're the ones playing us off against each other
[47:44.480 --> 47:48.400]  yeah we got differences everybody's got beef so there's been problems things have happened
[47:48.400 --> 47:56.400]  we got to forgive each other go to the next level or they're gonna be able to pick a soft one by one
[47:56.400 --> 48:04.160]  you must unify now unify under god unify under truth unify under our republic that's not perfect
[48:04.800 --> 48:09.440]  but it's a shiny example of where humanity could go and it's something that's an example
[48:09.440 --> 48:15.920]  against the globalists that they want to get rid of i can let them do it this challenge is not
[48:15.920 --> 48:21.840]  our defeat this challenge is our greatest moment preparing to happen this is the time that people
[48:21.840 --> 48:28.400]  of old wish they lived in this is a great time to be together this is an amazing time
[48:28.400 --> 48:35.360]  to be born in and to live in to have a chance to be here and what i believe when i know is the
[48:35.360 --> 48:43.440]  launch point of humanity's next level okay pedophile worship i'm not gonna list all the
[48:43.440 --> 48:49.200]  city council videos we've got and county commissioner videos and blues clues on pbs and
[48:49.200 --> 48:54.960]  all of it where they promote children having sex with adults or women in a satanic ritual that's
[48:54.960 --> 49:00.480]  what it is in public schools and libraries and other facilities bringing little children in
[49:00.480 --> 49:08.400]  to sit on the laps of horribly disgusting looking men in clown outfits and saying this is a woman
[49:08.400 --> 49:14.560]  it's one thing to say a man is a woman give them if the man looks like a woman has a proclivity to
[49:14.560 --> 49:19.760]  be a woman had some idea that's what they want and they're not after children that's their choice
[49:19.760 --> 49:26.800]  this is disgusting men in clown outfits big fat pedophiles and pedophile supporters literally
[49:26.800 --> 49:34.000]  coming after our children and the not even subliminal messages of molok in the video with
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.280]  children being given to the devil to be sacrificed to it in the blues clothes it's everywhere
[49:39.280 --> 49:47.200]  and then footage out of kenosha and footage out of portland and footage out of new york and footage
[49:47.200 --> 49:52.240]  out of seattle and i just saw footage out of out of dallas it's on band-aid video one of our
[49:52.240 --> 50:00.080]  contributors of people out there defending jojo rosenbaum who raped at least you know they only
[50:00.080 --> 50:05.760]  catch one out of ten or so so you did it obviously i would guess much more five little boys as young
[50:05.760 --> 50:12.960]  as what eight years old he would grab children out of parks throw them in a gully and sodomize them
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.360]  and now any to go a hunted man but he got the footage and it's not just his i mean i
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.400]  this morning at like five a.m i watched like seven of these videos or eight of these videos
[50:24.400 --> 50:36.240]  it's up close of them just just just worshiping rosenbaum say his name they didn't say the name
[50:36.240 --> 50:43.200]  you don't see the antifa scum saying the name of the little eight-year-old that got run over and
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.840]  died took two days to die eight-year-old walk the shaw terror attack victim jackson sparks
[50:47.840 --> 50:55.840]  they don't want the name of jackson sparks said no no no or the names of all these other people
[50:55.840 --> 51:00.080]  like this little girl julia fighting for her life ran over her head on purpose
[51:01.520 --> 51:05.840]  no no no no no no no no no they don't want you doing it no no they want you to say
[51:05.840 --> 51:21.280]  me his name joseph's child rapist coward scumbag rosenbaum here it is
[51:21.280 --> 51:37.280]  his name and notice the symbol of these evil ring rates
[51:38.800 --> 51:43.600]  is the mass they all wear that way they can all wear their mask and go out and commit their
[51:43.600 --> 51:48.080]  crimes and promote pedophiles and everything else and this is another group of people under
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.800]  slavery under satanic bondage marked for death by their masters remember these people are all
[51:52.800 --> 51:55.760]  being destroyed by the globalists they're all the ones taking the shots they're having the
[51:55.760 --> 51:59.360]  heart attacks they're having the blood clots they don't care because they'll do anything their god
[51:59.360 --> 52:03.360]  wants they'll hand their children over to it they'll go to drag queen story time they'll do whatever
[52:03.360 --> 52:12.800]  they have to because they love death let's play this clip this is a reporter asking to leave the
[52:12.800 --> 52:23.760]  jihadi squad lady have you wrestled with any potential downsides of releasing into society
[52:23.760 --> 52:28.400]  every single person who's in federal prison to lead everyone like oh my god we're just
[52:29.120 --> 52:32.960]  not releasing we're just going to release everybody that's not what i'm saying reporter
[52:32.960 --> 52:38.880]  that's what your bill says but they're going to be selective oh no no alex jones and rogers stone
[52:38.880 --> 52:44.720]  oh there'll be no clemency there it's their people that's what communists do remember general benton
[52:44.720 --> 52:49.520]  part and former head of air force weapons development head of the heart program head of secret space
[52:49.520 --> 52:55.040]  operations i mean he was read in at the highest level and he said on my show many times with
[52:55.040 --> 53:00.160]  the person he said listen jones there's a communist program powerful corporate forces are using
[53:00.160 --> 53:09.760]  communism as a takeover and he just explained that it's a it's a program and when you see them try
[53:09.760 --> 53:14.720]  to legalize and release violent offenders that's when you know they're about to have a violent
[53:14.720 --> 53:18.720]  uprising because they're promising to their people you can commit all the violence you want and once
[53:18.720 --> 53:24.000]  we get into power we're going to let you go he said that's when you know they're making their move
[53:24.000 --> 53:32.240]  so that on my show 25 years ago and here we are today and it's happening so here is one of the
[53:32.240 --> 53:39.280]  horsemen getting caught even on mainstream news and bs here it is in 2020 you endorsed the breed
[53:39.280 --> 53:45.760]  act which is a series of proposals to transform america's criminal justice system and create
[53:45.760 --> 53:52.720]  quote a roadmap for prison abolition the breed act proposes emptying federal detention facilities
[53:52.720 --> 54:01.040]  within 10 years to what extent have you wrestled with any potential downsides of releasing into
[54:01.040 --> 54:06.720]  society every single person who's currently in a federal prison yeah again i think that everyone's
[54:06.720 --> 54:11.120]  like oh my god we're gonna just release everybody that's not what i'm that's yeah but did you see
[54:11.120 --> 54:15.680]  how many people are mentally ill that are in prison right now no i know but the act that you
[54:15.680 --> 54:20.880]  endorsed actually says release everyone but in ten years but think about it who released
[54:20.880 --> 54:26.400]  me they were like human traffickers oh i know child sex so do you mean that you don't actually
[54:26.400 --> 54:31.040]  support that because no you endorsed the bill no i endorse the breed act and looking at federal
[54:31.040 --> 54:35.920]  the policies and how we incarcerate absolutely but it says in there but you cannot you cannot
[54:36.480 --> 54:41.040]  you cannot just blanketly say oh look she wants that's not what i'm but that's like in plain text
[54:43.440 --> 54:46.720]  because they're not going to release just everybody only the hardcore leftists that will
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.560]  commit crimes and murders under their orders that's why Pelosi said a few years ago oh i love
[54:52.560 --> 54:58.480]  ms-13 their god's children because they're running the child kidnapping rings they're running the
[54:58.480 --> 55:04.320]  slavery they're doing it all dr darin beady is going to be joining us to talk about the

[59:03.760 --> 59:10.080]  it's very very simple for their world government their anti-human post-human eugenics system to
[59:10.080 --> 59:16.640]  flourish freedom and liberty and due process injustice and god fearing systems must fail

[59:29.120 --> 59:34.960]  and they're not gonna go away and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have
[59:34.960 --> 59:39.840]  the fear of god put into them the average person still doesn't even know about the new world order
[59:39.840 --> 59:45.200]  or about globalism or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and
[59:45.200 --> 59:48.320]  that we're under attack we have any chance of beating these people
[59:52.400 --> 59:56.400]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:05.920]  it just might go down as the biggest media malfeasance to date the way the mainstream media
[1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:11.680]  handled the spiel dossier nonsense unable to turn a blind eye or cover up for being complicit
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:16.160]  into conspiracy any longer some outlets are being forced to address the issue head on
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:21.280]  in the wake of more Durham indictments and arrests axios describes it as a reckoning
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:26.640]  hitting news organizations and admits it's one of the most egregious journalistic errors in modern
[1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:33.120]  history the media spreading lies for years it relents it was outsized coverage of an unvetted
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:37.360]  document many journalists presented the former president for running more than half of the
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:43.360]  country against the media frequently repeating fake news fake news a phrase hillary clinton
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:49.840]  actually coined fake news and false propaganda but was it the media that created the monster fake
[1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:55.840]  news it's fake was it the media that created the contention by pushing a thinly sourced story
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:02.080]  based on rumors and lies as more truth comes out the washington post has corrected and removed
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:09.120]  large portions of two articles but will cnn or msnbc revisit or correct their coverage around
[1:01:09.120 --> 1:01:17.040]  the steel dossier since the axios article other outlets are acknowledging the malfeasance
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:21.760]  new york times says many of the dossier's allegations have turned out to be fictitious
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:27.520]  or at best unprovable it goes on to make some thinly veiled excuses for the coverage but says
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:33.040]  the distinction between what journalists assume and what we verify is often the difference between
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:38.880]  fiction and reality however when you don't toe the line for the approved narrative it seems
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:44.800]  you might just end up rated by the fbi it's looking more like the doj has been weaponized
[1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:51.120]  against dissenters and worse yet did the new york times collude with the fbi to target project
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:56.000]  veritas well some journalists don't approve of james oakie's style he is following the
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:01.200]  tenet of journalism to hold those in power accountable kudos to the journalists speaking
[1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:06.080]  out against the fbi raids against him and the reporters committee for freedom of the press
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:12.400]  for filing a motion to unseal the search warrant application as the acou statement says the president
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:18.240]  sent in this case could have serious consequences for press freedom and in biden's own words
[1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:24.800]  it's simply simply so you won't let your justice department do nothing he said that in may and
[1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:30.400]  yet here we are despite the intrusion project veritas is still exposing unethical conduct
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:35.520]  as listed in the society of professional journalists code of ethics expose unethical
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:42.000]  conduct and journalism including within their own organizations and that's just what one cbs
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:48.080]  insider was doing in exposing tegna you know what's not listed in spj code of ethics
[1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:55.040]  this unethical advice i challenge you to stop thinking in terms of objective journalism in
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:03:00.960]  fact the code of ethics advise ethical journalism should be accurate and fair it also says support
[1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:07.360]  the open and civil exchange of views even views they find repugnant but is the current state of
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:12.160]  journalism even concerned with serving the public anymore i don't really hear people
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:16.320]  trust us or not and still got into your job so i mean that's at least my own concern whether they
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:22.640]  trust me or not is this who you want to receive your news from playing pr for the current administration

[1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:20.240]  in for damage control and claims gates was taken out of context it also plays the game of saying no
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:26.560]  bill gates did not say the vaccine is ineffective but that wasn't the claim being made the claim
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:32.240]  was that the vaccine isn't working well because it doesn't block transmission and that is true
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:38.240]  that's exactly what bill gates said you know what is missing context reuters the conflict of
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:43.440]  interest here the fact that the founder and former ceo of reuters was elected to phisor's

[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:31.840]  wednesday november 24th worldwide broadcast brought to you by we the people not big corporations
[1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:39.360]  not bill gates or george soros well we like to be next year's news or next decade's news today or
[1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:45.920]  tomorrow's news today is our actual slogan and i told you that with operation lockstep and everything
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:49.200]  we were seeing with the pre-programming that they were going to release a virus and they were going
[1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:52.400]  to have lockdowns worldwide and they were going to use that for total control and then
[1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:56.160]  that it wouldn't be a vaccine it would erase your immunity and then they would have all these extra
[1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:01.600]  boosters they wanted to give you because they bragged about it in uh prospectus papers in the
[1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:12.960]  deep state talking about perspective viruses or scenarios well that wasn't even dead reckoning
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:19.040]  by me we we had the proof we knew we were right well if if if if dead reckoning is one thing
[1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:23.120]  where you have the evidence in your experience then then you make a prediction and it you know
[1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:28.960]  tends to be right this is certainty what we're about to talk about right now and that's that
[1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:34.000]  multinational corrupt interests want to use american power for world hegemony they don't
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:41.600]  like the western christian jude christian ethos of due process and liberal ideas they want corporate
[1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:47.440]  fascism so they took over the liberal movements and they took over then uh the major think tanks
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:52.400]  and they took over the aclu and with financing it's come out they took over a lot of the different
[1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:57.200]  radical white supremacist groups and for decades have been provocaturing them and using them as
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:01.760]  pretext to get americans to give up their free speech and their freedoms and now that there is a
[1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:07.600]  global populist awakening they tried to brand nationalism itself as racist and evil and horrible
[1:08:07.600 --> 1:08:12.720]  but only the big globalist combine corporations will save us and we do that by having them be the
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:19.280]  new religion as pelosi said last week of we're all racist and we're all bad and the earth is dying
[1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:24.160]  and carbon and based life forms are evil and we must do what the priest class and the media say
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:32.320]  for absolution or we're going to be in a living hell here and the world will end in 2030 that's
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:37.680]  what they've been saying that's what they've been doing well dr darin beatty is a former professor
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:41.120]  of political science duke university who went on to serve in the white house as a speechwriter
[1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  advisor to president trump he is now the founder of revolver dot news and has been really the driving
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:51.840]  force behind getting tucker carlson and many others to really look at what really happened on
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:57.200]  january 6 and now what's coming out of january 6 that whole narrative is i'm giving the next
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:03.520]  year's news today not having a midterm election as we would think of one creating racial division
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:11.680]  exacerbating trials fanning the flames hoping to get racial violence going to then legitimize
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:16.560]  this supposed censorship and controls and the justice department saying the number one terror
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:21.920]  threat when biden first got into january and then since then in the official u.s. government
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:26.320]  policy on terrorism that those that question elections those that question lockdowns those
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:31.840]  that question censorship are terrorists and must not just be silenced but arrested hillary clinton
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:36.720]  i've got the clip coming up later in this hour actually went on national tv with rachel manow
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:42.320]  and said they're losing they want to shut us all up we've got the head of feisers saying the same
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:48.080]  thing so the ruling corporate takeover isn't going too well oppositions exploding worldwide
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:53.840]  millions protesting daily in europe and other areas against what's happening and so the system is now
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:10:01.600]  going to double down so dr beatty joins us at darin beatty darin j beatty on twitter revolver.news
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:05.760]  to give us the latest he's got a big article out that he'll tell you about here in a moment then
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:11.200]  we'll obviously ask the big questions uh why aren't we getting re apps and these people that
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:15.040]  clearly are provocateurs of the feds why aren't we getting them subpoenaed well why aren't we
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:19.360]  hearing about the admitted fbi agents leading some of these groups why aren't we hearing about the
[1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:24.800]  fbi agent that ran the whole fake whitmer kidnapping plot being involved in january six why aren't
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:30.000]  why are we hearing roger stone and alex jones well that's the new narrative that again oh we
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.040]  did it on purpose we attacked the capital we're terrorist it was an insurrection which even the
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:41.280]  fbi admits is not true and so we've got to have a war with ourselves we've got to have an authoritarian
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:46.240]  purge that's quite the intro but that's where we're at dr beatty thank you so much for coming on us
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:51.920]  great to be here thank you well you heard me play out the waterfront you can start wherever
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:58.560]  you'd like another's a lot of news yep well um if your readers are familiar i'd like to talk a
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:06.000]  little bit more about the re app situation and this is a uh very live story it recently gained
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:12.720]  attention on none other than the joe rogan podcast uh joe rogan brought up the revolver
[1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:19.120]  dot news article on air scrolled through it and he talked to his guests and the remarkable thing is
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:26.560]  his guests were i must say not um incredibly uh informed assuming that their intentions were
[1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:34.480]  good these were representatives of of of google i believe and um other uh disinformation industries
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:40.560]  that serve the interests and the narratives of the regime but rogan to his credit said look
[1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:45.680]  are you going to call you know the conspiracy theory the idea that there was some uh a false
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:51.600]  flag aspects to one six i'm going to pull this up i'm going to show you this individual ray apps
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:58.720]  who's seen multiple occasions in fact the day before january six he's seen all over the place
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:04.880]  going to different groups redirecting their energies and focusing them on a singular mission
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:10.800]  and that mission is to go into the capital and because trump supporters are peaceful people
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:17.280]  there had been hundreds of trump rallies without anything remotely resembling that level of vandalism
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:22.400]  the trump supporters immediately identified something was off and in fact in one occasion
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:29.040]  chanted fed at him they knew there was something off with him but he was persistent he wasn't just
[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:37.920]  there the day before he was a wears wall though figure on january six everywhere ubiquitous
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:44.480]  but dedicated to the mission that he adduced the previous evening and that is going to the capital
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:50.640]  he's corralling the crowd saying let's go to the capital he goes around for days like a robot parrot
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:54.880]  saying attack the capital he goes around for days like a robot i mean this is insane and where's
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:13:01.280]  his subpoena where his subpoenas well no no so just just to emphasize and this is so you know
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:06.880]  there's some other aspects that i think are equally if not more damning as it pertains to
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:13.200]  the federal roll in one six but the advantage of the eps story is it's all caught on tape tape
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:18.400]  and there's something about video evidence that's inherently viral and it's really
[1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:25.120]  seized people's attention to say what the hell is going on with this guy because from the time
[1:13:25.120 --> 1:13:32.160]  the evening before one six when he's saying let's go into the capital to literally two seconds
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:39.520]  before the initial breach on capital grounds two seconds before the same individual reaps
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:46.160]  it's whispering in somebody's ear and two seconds later that guy bursts down the fence
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:52.720]  and the thing is it's not like the feds had zero interest in him from the beginning as i believe
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:59.680]  i've pointed out in my last appearance here the fbi originally put eps on its first of 20 most
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:05.920]  wanted january six figures and they said just like they do with the pipe bomb thing just like
[1:14:05.920 --> 1:14:11.360]  they do with everything else they pretend to care they say we really need the public's help in
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:16.880]  identifying this guy then the internet being what it is identified him in like a day and then
[1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:21.840]  crickets from the feds they knew who he was it was clear they knew who he was they just didn't do
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:28.640]  anything and they waited months and months until revolver.news ran a report a report i must say
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:37.360]  on on steward roads and the day after that report was published the fbi quietly scrubs
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:44.240]  scrubs eps's name and information from their public database and they haven't said anything
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:51.520]  about him since and after this major piece that came out from revolver being a very detailed
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:58.640]  expose of reyeps who he is where he's from what his activities were some of the other people
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:04.000]  that looked like he was coordinating with after we ran that piece and just blew up and it gained
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:11.280]  national attention um to intrepid citizen journalists actually tracked down eps at his ranch
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:18.080]  in arizona and they asked him so what's the deal with this and frankly in my opinion he looked guilty
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:23.840]  as hell when confronted that that way he scurried off back into his property but the amazing thing
[1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:30.080]  is the day after those two citizen journalists confronted eps guess who knocks on their door
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:37.280]  none other than the arizona fbi so the fbi is more interested in anyone who would dare to ask
[1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:44.160]  questions about eps than eps himself when in the mountains of video documentary evidence of one six

[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:41.760]  the night life ain't a good life but it's my life
[1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:46.880]  many people just like me
[1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:52.560]  dreaming all we used to be
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:58.320]  is
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:04.880]  welcome back i'm alex jones your host dr darin j beatty is our guest advisor to trump speech
[1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:10.560]  writer and a guy who really was seminal in an investigating january 6 and really codifying
[1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:15.920]  the fact that it wasn't just some anti-fudge pressed up like trump supporters it it wasn't
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:20.000]  just no no it no it was the deep state it was the pentagon it was the justice department
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:25.040]  it was all those groups saying groups around oklahoma city event they were there and we know
[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:29.840]  that and they're not being touched but boy they're all over the news saying they want to put me in
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:35.280]  jail and we've got the former deputy director of the fbi we'll get that clip ready from yesterday
[1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:40.160]  here in a few minutes saying alex jones and roger stoner right at the red hot center or
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:45.680]  what happened on january 6 yeah i'm at the center almost getting totally set up the whole damn thing
[1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:52.000]  was a setup thank god we you know that we figured it out tried to stop it but oh i'm at the red
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:22:00.960]  hot center ladies and gentlemen abs no no no mr mccabe is at the red hot center and and and so
[1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:04.480]  doc our listeners know about ray epps will play a joe rogan clip here too in a minute
[1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:08.400]  in fact let's just play the clip you were talking about here it is ray epps
[1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:16.560]  yep yeah please meet ray epps the fed protected provocateur who appears to have led the very
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:22.240]  first um one six attack january 6 attack on the us capital so let's watch some of this because
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:30.320]  it's crazy it's really weird this guy is doing this like over and over and over again there's
[1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:34.960]  a video of it but this is an article about oh so this is an article that's in revolver
[1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:43.280]  well i'll get the video we'll find the video because the video is in strange ray epps video here it
[1:22:43.280 --> 1:22:50.160]  is like this well it's 20 minutes long well just watch we'll see some of it and again i'm not gonna
[1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:57.440]  play the whole thing here i wonder who told joe about all this i i wonder if joe is more interested
[1:22:57.440 --> 1:23:03.360]  now that they're trying to put his friend in jail for january 6 i wonder if joe's gonna be talking
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:07.440]  about that more soon now because again there's not just the evil justice department the universe
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:14.800]  there's also america waking up and so that's where we are going back to dr beady you know epps is
[1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:18.400]  important the fact that he's not been subpoena is important but there's so many other things coming
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:24.400]  out and the fact that this january 6 committee officially says upfront in their investigation
[1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:28.720]  we know this is an attack we know it's an insurrection was a plan to overthrow the government
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:33.920]  but no it was really a plan to demonize their opposition we now know how do you have a fair
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:38.880]  investigation when it's purely political and upfront they say we know this was a plan to
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:43.600]  overthrow the government and so now here's who we say are guilty guilty until proven guilty
[1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:50.320]  well i mean clearly there's never any intention of having a fair investigation from the beginning
[1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:57.360]  this is meant to be a political type of show trial meant to advance a political narrative
[1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:06.480]  uh whose result in effect um justifies demonizing over half of the country of american patriots
[1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:12.800]  uh trump supporters but not just trump supporters really anyone including left-wing dissidents who
[1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:17.600]  find the abuses of the regime intolerable just to lump all of those people together
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:26.560]  and declare them domestic terrorists because of their political beliefs and weaponize the full
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:33.040]  force of the american national security apparatus against them that's is what's at stake in this
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:40.320]  false january 6 narrative it's not just the people who are being held in solitary confinement
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:48.720]  for trivial offenses while the big fish swim free still to this day it's not just for them
[1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:55.520]  it's for all of us because the narrative is being used to point to all of us as domestic terrorists
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:00.480]  that's why it's so important and that's why getting to the bottom of this getting to the truth of 1
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:08.400]  6 is so important because the whole thing it's only purpose is to be exploited and used politically
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:13.760]  toward that end that's the only purpose and that's why of course they're going after you because you're
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:19.280]  one of the most effective people in media who isn't part of the controlled media that's why
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:24.640]  they're going after steve bannon because he's another profoundly effective person in media
[1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:29.440]  and they're going after roger stone because he's known as an effective advisor to president
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:36.400]  trump and so forth this is all political because any other explanation would require the feds to
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:43.040]  have a good answer for why some of the key people who take place in this event in the case of ray
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:48.960]  abs it's not just some guy saying oh go into the capital he is by all accounts by all this video
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:56.160]  evidence very evidently one of the key orchestrators of the initial breach of the capital which set
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:04.720]  off this whole event and they don't want him so it just doesn't make any sense unless we very
[1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:12.960]  seriously entertain the darkest of dark possibilities which is this is part of a long and really dirty
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:21.120]  narrative very dirty practices going back decades as you said to the oklahoma city bombing involving
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:28.080]  many of the key players from back in those days including merit garland who was the key quote
[1:26:28.080 --> 1:26:34.880]  unquote domestic terrorism guy in the doj under clinton in the early 90s just as the government
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:42.000]  was kicking off into high gear it's practice of infiltrating domestic so-called malay ruby ridge
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:49.520]  weiko oklahoma city nothing's changed and so it's clear i know you don't like to speculate doctor but
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:54.400]  they're saying that the right wingers are going to be terrorist with head terms no we're winning
[1:26:54.400 --> 1:26:58.720]  we're 10 points ahead even in mainline polls the biggest republican lead since they started
[1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:03.040]  taking modern polls 100 years ago so they're in full disaster mode and remember bill clinton
[1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:11.280]  said on air force one after reelection in 96 and to over 50 pool reporters he said i owe my reelection
[1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:16.240]  oklahoma city and that helped bring the country together really reputed the republicans so
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:20.640]  they played the card before it's the same criminals in there again and if we don't think
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:26.480]  they're going to stage false flags and exacerbate racial division to legitimize them saying that the
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:30.560]  that the that the christians and the conservatives and the trump supporters and those that question
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:34.560]  elections and vaccine mandates are terrorist if we don't think they're not going to stage
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:40.880]  provocateur something we're dumb that's the final ingredient in this doctor right and you know what
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:48.960]  the the silver lining in this is that uh i think a large swath of the american public is ready and
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:53.760]  they're on to the game and the remarkable thing that i've seen and you've probably seen this too
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:59.120]  since you've been studying this in much greater depth and for a lot longer than i have but from
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:05.040]  what i've seen on the basis of my investigation of the history of these types of federal operations
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:12.560]  is they're remarkably uncreated they're remarkably resistant to modifying their techniques and so
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:20.800]  you see the same patterns over and over and over again extremely formulaic yes exactly and you see
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:25.840]  a lot of the same you know paint by numbers approach to these domestic ops you see these
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:31.920]  elements in one six and the thing is is that unlike in the 90s where clinton was around in
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:38.160]  the oklahoma city thing um even though the oligarchs have done a pretty good job at shutting down
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:46.160]  the internet they haven't done it completely and the internet age albeit censored post uh 2016
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:50.800]  is it simply makes it very difficult for them to pull off these ops and stay there we gotta
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:53.520]  go to break let's come back and and get your expertise on what you think they're gonna pull

[1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:33.600]  books i knew about false flags i mean world war two started with false flags hitler saying the
[1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:38.160]  poles that attacked their military basic lie wits who had kicked it off and that later came out in
[1:33:38.160 --> 1:33:44.960]  nuremberg trials i knew about the rise tag that hitler used to become a dictator but then i was
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:51.760]  just getting on air in 95 on local access tv and general benton k parton had been the former head
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:57.040]  of air force weapons development he'd run the secret space program star wars i mean high level
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:04.720]  three star general and he was on local tv and even traveled to austin to come on access television
[1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:08.320]  and say they had bombs in the building here's the feds here's how they did it they're using this to
[1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:12.560]  you know declare the american people the enemy to start setting up a secret police and so i got to
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:15.920]  sit there and got to know the guy i probably interviewed him 50 times went out to dinner with
[1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:25.120]  him five or six times and so i sat at the feet of that type of person former head of fbi agent in
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:31.040]  the la sector ted gonderson was running around exposing all this at the time and so that's
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:36.400]  where i got my knowledge i didn't just develop this out of some you know magic wand and now we're
[1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:41.600]  here and i'm telling you dr beatty doesn't like to speculate he's going off the facts here but they
[1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:46.400]  are so scared of just him pointing out that this should be investigated because it messes up their
[1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:51.040]  whole narrative that doesn't end with roger stone and alice jones of steve bannon in jail claiming
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:56.320]  we ran some insurrection it's saying the american people themselves are an enemy of the state and
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:03.600]  had to be targeted i mean this is a real purge like lennon going after the kulaks or stalin or hitler
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:07.520]  you know saying oh it's the jews i'm gonna get them and of course once he got the jews he got
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:12.320]  everybody that's how it always works so this is a real authoritarian takeover not in my view i know
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:17.120]  it's here but you got cut off by the break doctor please continue and then let's just get your view
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:24.080]  on where this is going the expanded uh show trials and how how you think we stop this i mean obviously
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:28.640]  exposing it sunlight's the best disinfectant but what else can we do get members of congress
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.160]  talking more about this i know they're starting to send letters and things after you and tugger's
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:41.360]  work yes well first of all it's uh quite fitting that you should mention the term kulak our most
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:46.960]  recent piece on revolver dot news which is up there live right now in the very top is titled
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:55.040]  are you ready to be an american kulak which draws upon the very real very visceral and very dark
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:02.400]  and disturbing historical parallels between the deplorables broadly speaking the american patriots
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:10.000]  and uh the kulak class which was the enemy political class of the bolshevik revolutionaries
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.960]  and so i'd encourage everyone anyone who wants to learn more about that historical parallel
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:20.720]  in order to understand more deeply the dire situation that we're in now is to go to revolver
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:25.200]  and read that and well that wasn't a mistake i mean i read the article i was i was sawed this morning
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:32.080]  so spend some time next segment on that right now getting back to the main central area yeah um so
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:37.840]  the question is you know where where things going from here how do they stop it well from my perspective
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:45.920]  i consider my duty to uh continue with our investigative work and we have a lot of major
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:52.640]  pieces in the works and just to provide a little bit of teasers to what's coming up um there's
[1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:58.320]  so much more to the reyep story that people know the reyep story there's a reason why
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:05.360]  the feds are so obviously sensitive to anyone touching the reyep issue it's really the key
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:13.200]  that unlocks the whole thing and we've taken an extremely deep extremely meticulous dive
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:19.120]  into not only reyeps but all of the various people that he seemed to be coordinating with
[1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:24.640]  on that day and it's interesting to point that out because the new york times in a damage control
[1:37:24.640 --> 1:37:30.640]  piece falsely reported that oh reyeps is this lone actor he wasn't coordinating with anyone
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:36.800]  that is very clearly false when you look at and study the video evidence there are many people
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:42.880]  that he's communicating with that he seems to be working with and believe it or not many of
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:49.200]  those people who themselves have pretty egregious records when it comes to the initial breach a lot
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:55.520]  of these people are also curiously unindicted so we're going to tell the full story of that
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:02.480]  whole breach team that whole um uh sorted issue leading up to the initial breach because really
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:08.560]  this is what kicked it all off and the feds seem to have zero interest in all of these events and
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:14.320]  all of the key players who are instrumental in that initial capital breach that set it all off
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:20.240]  so we're going to tell that story in full and in detail and the follow-up piece from that is we
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:28.400]  have a major smoking gun piece that's going to show beyond any doubt that the feds knew in advance of
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:36.400]  some major aspect of this uh so-called insurrection plot so we have some amazing stuff coming up
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:43.280]  and I think persistence in this regard um really gets you a long way because as you know being
[1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:51.920]  person in the media the news cycles can be so fast there's this fantasmagoria of novelty of new
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:58.960]  information the new thing to be outraged about the new thing that you know aoc or a new dress that's
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:04.720]  outrageous and all of these things and it's so easy for people to get distracted and it's so easy
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:10.560]  for people just to latch onto the wrong narrative to latch their justified indignation onto the
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:16.320]  wrong narrative and that's why when we shifted the narrative from the antifa stuff onto the false
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:22.560]  flag that's why the regime freaked out so much what they can't stand is when people are right over
[1:39:22.560 --> 1:39:28.880]  the one narrative that they don't want and when we hold on to it persistently and demand answers
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:34.560]  so that I think can go a long way just not dropping the ball staying exactly keep keep
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:38.800]  hammering it like you and Tucker and I and and Bannon and everybody's doing and of course Roger
[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:44.560]  still had nothing to do with any of this the idea that we're being investigated is wanting to overthrow
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:48.320]  the government and all this crap when the feds though don't want you to look at any people that
[1:39:48.320 --> 1:39:52.400]  actually broke in they want to arrest some of the soccer moms and folks that came in and didn't know
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:57.360]  what was going on I mean this is so obvious so aren't they kind of building a trap for themselves
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:01.680]  trying to have even this kangaroo court in in Congress and all this because by bringing this
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:08.000]  back up it's going to bring up the truth of what they did well in many ways they are and again I've
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.760]  looked at this from so many different angles and looked at the kind of strategic dimensions of it
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:19.840]  and in certain respects I'd be happy to elaborate on this if you like but there are many respects
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:26.880]  some very important in which putting myself in the shoes of the the government and again the
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:32.640]  government's not monolithic it's the congress it's elements of the FBI different groups with competing
[1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:38.320]  interests and priorities there's some groups that want to maximize the political effect who
[1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:44.640]  want to go full in on this narrative that elements of Trump's inner circle and people like you play
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:52.160]  some role coordinating with Trump is of course nonsense it's preposterous but that's politically
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:57.600]  the most kind of salacious thing and that's what they want to focus on but there are other elements
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:41:05.520]  I think within within the FBI and other agencies who understand that a full-throated pursuit of
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:11.040]  that political narrative could actually be counterproductive in the sense that it leads to tripping
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:18.880]  over landmines that end up exposing the federal involvement in this and because of the compartmentalized
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:24.960]  nature of these types of operations I don't think every element that you see pursuing
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:31.600]  one-six investigation is fully briefed on what exactly happened and so that accounts for some of
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:37.760]  the interesting mismessaging like we've seen some messaging coming out saying oh actually this wasn't
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:44.560]  some pre-planned event this wasn't some pre-planned uh uh sure the FBI didn't by accident tell Reuters
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:48.800]  Roger Stoner and Alex Jones we've investigated did not coordinate with Trump but were not involved
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:52.720]  in an attempt to overthrow things which is true and they did investigate us so why would they tell
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.520]  the truth and then on the other hand they're attacking well that's exactly in my view that's
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:04.320]  exactly what i'm talking about is that there are elements within the feds whose view is look
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:09.920]  we've already set this off we pulled it off successfully we've successfully created a
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:15.920]  narrative that is now going to be used to weaponize national security apparatus against American
[1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:21.680]  patriots now let's quit while we're ahead because if we pursue this first of all it's going to come
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:26.880]  out that the whole notion that you had involvement or stone or anyone else it's there's just going
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:32.640]  to be no evidence there just like the resi gate stuff but secondly there's only downside in fact
[1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:38.720]  extreme downside because continuing to pursue that there are so many landmines around here
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:44.480]  and again because of the compartmentalization the political operatives on the congressional side
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:49.840]  and others aren't necessarily briefed into the full story of what the feds did and so they can
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:55.440]  unwittingly step on those landmines and so exactly dr beading stay there stay there i'm gonna come
[1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:01.440]  right back and talk more about this for a fraction of today anyone who is awake can clearly see why
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:08.160]  alex jones was deep platform info wars was right above the target and the globalists were a year

[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:41.440]  want to kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new ussa but we won't let them alex

[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:59.520]  darin j bd leaves us uh you work you got caught up by the break up other points you want to make
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:04.560]  about what's currently happening with the january 6 kanga record where you expect that to go i was
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:09.600]  there trying to uh a provocateur racial division america that seems to be backfiring on them and
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:15.200]  then let's talk about your new article that's excellent very lengthy that revolver news are
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:20.480]  you ready to be an american coolac because that is the model these authoritarians are using so
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:26.160]  so tell us about that as well doc yeah just a little bit about this this is a follow-up on an
[1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:31.280]  earlier piece that we did which was one of the darkest pieces we ever ran but it's very important
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:38.720]  and uh it circulated very widely and this piece explored the parallels between our current situation
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:44.560]  and the bolshevik revolutionary situation and this coolac piece which is up right now in revolver
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:52.080]  dot news sort of is a compendium to that um that explores one very specific and i think one really
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:59.200]  important parallel and that is the parallel of the coolac the coolac being the um political enemy
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:06.640]  class within the soviet regime the coolac's were kind of peasants hated by peasants so to speak
[1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:13.760]  and any type of peasant revolt that was attempted was always blamed as oh these are coolac records
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:20.720]  the coolac's are ruining things the coolac's is why this latest soviet industrial program didn't work
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:26.320]  they're the only acceptable victim class and every failure of the regime on the basis of its
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:32.400]  corruption and incompetence simply cycled into an intensified and more vigorous political
[1:49:32.400 --> 1:49:37.760]  persecution of the coolac's and i think that's in many ways what you see in the united states only
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:45.120]  instead of coolac's you substitute it for frankly um mostly a white middle class working class white
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:51.520]  is certainly a demonized term although i wouldn't suggest that whites are the only people who belong
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:58.320]  to this in fact when um minorities do something that the regime doesn't like the the regime has a
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:03.920]  habit of referring to those minorities as white like the the white hispanic and so forth so it's
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:10.960]  it's an ever-expanding term that's used to encompass all the enemies of the regime and to blame them
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:16.480]  for the regime's failures when really the failures result from the corruption and incompetence so i
[1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:22.160]  think for people to really understand the situation that we're in politically and understand maybe
[1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:27.280]  that there are some limitations to thinking that we can solve this through some kind of ordinary
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:31.760]  process well let's talk about how we do it because because how we do get that done because i totally
[1:50:31.760 --> 1:50:39.520]  agree with you and so the entire globalist corporate fascist system is using communism as the
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:43.840]  operating system but they're really offshore and above it obama before he left office gave
[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:48.160]  speeches saying well we need a mix of communist countries and capitalist countries so slave
[1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:52.640]  countries than quasi-free countries uh so the powerful money interests don't have to live under
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:51:01.440]  what they themselves have installed as a control system but it's breathtaking it's extraordinary
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:09.120]  and i don't have words to describe how in a historical lens or yardstick to say whites are
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:15.760]  inherently evil and it's inherently bad is the only thing that gets hitler but the other way around
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:21.200]  and then to have a ruling class of rich white people pushing this as their operating system
[1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:29.200]  for divide and conquer is just overtly criminal overtly discrediting and and and i'm surprised
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.320]  it's had as much success as it has but the polls the numbers when i see show it's rapidly losing
[1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:39.920]  its effect and backfiring now a do you agree with that then b how do we counter something this dirty
[1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:48.960]  this nasty like social war they're trying to stoke well it it is remarkable and as illuminating as
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:57.520]  historical antecedents can be and as illuminating as it can be to describe contemporary situation in
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:05.440]  terms of existing ideologies isms communism capitalism and so forth the condition in the
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:12.640]  west and particularly in the united states is remarkable i think principally for its
[1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:19.440]  newness and i'm not aware if there's any other time in history that the dominant ideology of the
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:28.960]  country is connected with the political demonization and dehumanization of the basically majority
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:36.400]  and founding stock of that very country you have cases where nations can be extremely vicious
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:41.360]  yeah they usually target a weak minority as the scapegoat exactly why is it starting a fight with
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:48.720]  one of the most powerful groups well i think power isn't always power in numbers and i think
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:56.320]  we do have an elite in this regime or i hate to use the term elite maybe a corrupt ruling class
[1:52:56.320 --> 1:53:05.360]  that is in the minority and the um the kulak population could be uh uh quite uh quite numerous
[1:53:05.360 --> 1:53:10.880]  but lacks political power and i think that characterizes the condition of the modern day
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:16.160]  kulaks the deplorables quite well because the deplorables are able there are tens and tens
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:22.480]  of millions of them half the country maybe even more but in terms of institutional power within
[1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:28.640]  the united states or what i now call the globalist american empire um really the deplorables have
[1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:35.120]  zero institutional power there's not a single major important institution in this country
[1:53:35.120 --> 1:53:41.680]  that's principally controlled by the deplorables and so that's why we're here is is is the corrupt
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:47.600]  corporate establishment has taken over all the major power positions and so now it sees that
[1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:52.480]  it's done as long as it can annihilate any populist opposition it will stay in power forever and it
[1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:56.800]  even wants to use the process of starting a fight with that populist movement as the excuse of putting
[1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:04.480]  in a permanent police state exactly and you know this this is a very difficult situation as i said
[1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:12.240]  there's no real um historical precedent for this particular type of regime there are many different
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:17.840]  ways that i think that wokeness is the dominant ideology maybe even the religion of the united
[1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:24.720]  states i think that wokeness um is deeply ingrained into the incentive structure and the
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:31.120]  oncology of our economy it's deeply ingrained into the nature in which uh the united states
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:37.600]  exercises power hillary admits hillary and and and and all of them uh pelosi that the liberal
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:42.400]  leftism is the religion and the operating system they want to basically send around the world
[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:46.880]  doesn't matter if apple runs slave factory doesn't matter uh the un's killing avricates by the tens
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:52.160]  of thousands for their land in central africa it's okay because they they say they're liberal and
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:54:58.000]  tim cooks gay i mean it's literally just a horrible corporate system wrapping itself in the camouflage
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:04.640]  of of limp-risted liberalism when it has nothing to even do with that right no and but there is
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:12.480]  like real method to the madness and if you look for instance at the phenomenon of woke capital all
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:19.600]  the major um corporate enterprises embracing the woke ideology we had another piece on revolver.news
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:24.000]  i think is really important and it basically exposed this whole i think it's kind of a
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:30.080]  conservative trope that's almost like a pacifier this notion that if you go woke you go broke
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:36.720]  in fact in the larger economy it's almost the opposite unless you go woke as a major corporation
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:42.880]  you will be destroyed being a major corporation the united states that is not explicitly woke
[1:55:42.880 --> 1:55:49.280]  is equivalent to being a corporation in china that does not embrace the ccp and part of the
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:53.680]  docnew five more minutes was we got to go to break i want to ask you how we get out of this again i want
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:57.440]  to go back to that central question we were absolutely right the global operating system of
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:02.080]  these corporations is wokeism it's a religion a system they're forcing on us how do we counter

[1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:16.640]  i'm no stranger to the rain i'm a friend of thunder friend is it any wonder i want to
[2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:22.720]  invite dr bd of revolver news to do a one hour or two hour podcast with me in studio in austin as
[2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:28.880]  soon as we can fly him down here and joe rogan's pet peeve is don't push guests on it but i gotta
[2:00:28.880 --> 2:00:32.800]  sneak a suspicion we could probably get him on joe because joe's really awake and when he was over
[2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:36.640]  here at the studio tempel is really here he stayed here the whole time we didn't want to say that on
[2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:42.240]  air uh you know he he talked about the capo and he's really starting to get it and joe's really
[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:48.320]  awake now you know before he would project his own niceness onto the establishment now he's they
[2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:53.360]  got a big problem on their hands i mean joe's as smart as i am or smarter and he now is is on the
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:57.040]  case uh but doc of the three or four minutes we have left i just want to say you're a real
[2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:01.520]  intellectual you really know your history a wide-ranging spectrum of it people to integrate it
[2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:05.440]  together you're one of the only other people i know that that has a deep grasp but i'm not trying
[2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:11.680]  to like oh your deep grasp like i have but this is the operating system of this group that's using
[2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:16.240]  these historical hegellian principles on people and folks better get this because you're right
[2:01:16.240 --> 2:01:21.680]  everything else is a side issue compared to the official policy of the u.s government is people that
[2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:27.520]  question elections and lockdowns are terrorist and the i mean i know people in the cia in the epi
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:32.160]  they've all gotten out because they say no we're training to take on the american people i mean i
[2:01:32.160 --> 2:01:36.000]  know a lot of folks i'm gonna leave it at that and they're they're all just getting out which again
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.960]  is a purge naturally where the good people get out now the bad people are in i mean this is really
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:45.200]  a formula i think is what you're saying and people need to know this is very methodical and very
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:50.800]  dangerous and i think what you're saying is only grasping the the full attack is what can empower
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:55.760]  us and that congress needs to get this understanding very quickly so three minutes left and give us
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:03.040]  your closing comments yes i think first of all we can only hope to succeed on the basis of a sober
[2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:09.680]  understanding of what our situation actually is what our government actually is and what our country
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:16.000]  actually is in its current state so it would be you know very pretty to just dismiss all of these
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:21.360]  and pretend like politics can go on as usual but the real fact is i've said this in other
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:29.440]  another occasions is that politics as we know it will continue to be fake and performative
[2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:35.280]  until the national security state is brought to heal you simply cannot have any organic
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:41.680]  successful real effectual political movements if you have major swaths of our own national
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:48.240]  security apparatus doing infiltration operations and setting up and doing all sorts of things to
[2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:54.320]  tee off narratives with the assists of the apparatchik media to demonize half of the country for
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:59.440]  their political beliefs so i think just being conscious of the role that the national security
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:06.880]  state plays which is new to a lot of people especially conservatives who are i think dispositionally
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:12.960]  rever differential to the security state that's one thing i think the second thing and what we
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:22.160]  can do is as bad as the regime is and as overt as its abuses are it still depends on our belief
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:29.040]  in its legitimacy and so it's really important for us to understand how illegitimate the regime is
[2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:35.040]  how evil it is and how corrupted it is and i think again this is a special task for conservatives
[2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:39.920]  who haven't really figured out in these present conditions which are very different from what
[2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:47.200]  we've had before how to be patriotic but at the same time don't give the corrupt and evil regime
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:55.440]  the legitimacy that it needs to engage to and to conduct its war on you politically and that's a
[2:03:55.440 --> 2:04:00.960]  task that it's it's not an easy solution but that's absolutely what conservatives american
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:07.120]  patriots in distance all of all stripes need to do stop giving the system the legitimacy that it
[2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:14.160]  needs in order to crush you well please come back on after Thanksgiving and i definitely want to get
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:19.200]  you down here i just know that joe's way overbooked months and months out but i know that he's gonna

[2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:27.520]  understand the false flag once you understand how so many corrupt regimes use this to take over

[2:06:36.400 --> 2:06:41.360]  to release it last week and then i just got so busy i'm like hey we never aired that so it's still
[2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:50.160]  very timely and we're going to be airing that coming up in the fourth hour today

[2:07:29.360 --> 2:07:32.720]  like a carnival barker because a carnival barker is exhausted their job is to sit there and tell
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:36.160]  you something over and over again and try to get you to come play the game or you know try to win
[2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:40.720]  the teddy bear i'm not trying to sell you playing games and get the teddy bear with for your girlfriend

[2:07:47.120 --> 2:07:51.360]  spiritual battle and we need to understand how much trouble we're in we need to take action
[2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:55.840]  so don't you ever think listeners that i don't know sometimes i look and act like a damn train
[2:07:55.840 --> 2:08:01.920]  right but it's because seven days a week some days i feel good some days i feel exhausted
[2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:07.440]  some days i feel down some days i feel like i'm on top of the world but i'm i'm here hammering
[2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:15.360]  because i can't sit here knowing this eagles going down and not stand up to it and one of my greatest
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:19.520]  frustrations and i'm not just telling you about my personal life i want you to understand this so
[2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:23.840]  you get this and i think you already probably think like this i just want you to know i think just
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:30.720]  like you i get physically pissed off when i see average people getting screwed over by corrupt
[2:08:30.720 --> 2:08:39.520]  shysters i don't like it and because i i have empathy i know that's being done to me my neighbor's
[2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:43.840]  house gets broken into it's mine next but it's not even i have to like think of that it's empathy
[2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:49.680]  like that could be me i'm i'm pissed off i'm pissed off on a white dude goes into church and shoots
[2:08:49.680 --> 2:08:57.680]  black people who's a racist scumbag and i get really pissed off the same way when a crazy racist
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:09:01.440]  black person goes and kills a bunch of innocent white people but then i get more pissed because the
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:09.520]  media covers it up and yeah because it's white people being killed and that makes me at a very
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:15.280]  fundamental level get even more angry but that's what claus Schwab said he goes we're having an
[2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:18.880]  angry or world so we can take over so here's what i'm trying to get at
[2:09:26.400 --> 2:09:34.720]  in february that big blue northern was coming down that arctic hammer that's super chill
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:41.600]  chill that northern blast i've got the technical term for it and
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:47.840]  polar vortex thank you people think folks are my ear telling me it's all the time but the crew
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:55.040]  does occasionally pop in and help me polar vortex thank you and so the texas weather bureau
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:10:02.480]  and the us weather bureau know up six days before it hit said uh we got an estimate of the computer
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:10.080]  models in six days that's going to hit the midwest in texas and it's going to cause massive power
[2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:13.760]  outages because people are going to try to heat their homes and we don't even have enough power
[2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:20.880]  right now with the federal rules on what we're allowed to do and so four days before texas
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:28.720]  sends an emergency letter to the epa and to the department of energy and said please let us up
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:34.560]  the power on these coal power plants they're the only plants where we've got boxcars full of coal
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:38.640]  and and if you allow us to to fire them back up to full capacity we'll have enough power
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:47.680]  and the feds said no and on that valentine's day at midnight the power went out over most of the
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:52.720]  state and then i was out of power at my house for two weeks my parents were only out a few days
[2:10:52.720 --> 2:10:56.560]  i went over their house to shower but the point was we were on backup generators in here in the
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:05.440]  dark you saw it if you had power hundreds of people died and it turned out that urcaut the
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:10.160]  same as enron stole 20 something billion dollars but they know we don't have a memory so who cares
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:17.920]  by charging up to four billion dollars extra a day by not letting texas generate its own power
[2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:23.760]  but buying it from mexico and other areas that had coal power plants and i showed you the letter
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:31.520]  on air from my studio with like limited power barely on air i showed you the letter from the state
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:36.160]  saying let us up the power and the feds saying no and they had fat checkers come out and say
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:41.040]  that i was a liar and that nobody cut our power i've got the damn document
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:49.120]  and then you see sake and all the rest of them going a month ago well gas prices are going up's
[2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:56.720]  good i mean you'll use less it's for the earth and here's the secretary jennifer granholm
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:05.600]  sat up there and said just a few weeks ago well yeah we're in a transition you're not going to
[2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:10.720]  have power for a while they're not building the transition it doesn't exist they're like let's
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:16.560]  just charge people double trouble for the power give them power half the time you're going on the
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:22.560]  venezuela model let me tell you why i got pissed i didn't just get pissed that i was here in the dark
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:29.040]  or that i was washing my ass in my swimming pool it was that
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:34.880]  this is just the beginning and i told you months before get ready they're going to turn the power
[2:12:34.880 --> 2:12:40.320]  off because they follow an exact formula the power never goes up to them you know in terry town and
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:46.400]  the elite areas of austin they have grids where they never don't have power the super rich government
[2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:51.280]  districts of the country they never have run out of power just like solchescus romania these people
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:54.880]  act the same over and over again no matter what color they are or where they're at
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:06.000]  it's tyranny and so we had the documents and i showed them on air where the texas asked to
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:10.080]  up power and were told no and it wasn't till the power went off a day later they said now you're
[2:13:10.080 --> 2:13:14.240]  allowed to do emergency power people go why didn't texas just ignore them well we're under federal
[2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:19.520]  regulations and governor abit got awards from him for signing us on to this years ago and and the
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:24.160]  state's not bucking it you know the city say well let illegal aliens and murderers be here
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:27.680]  we're not going to we're going to ignore federal law but when it comes to turning our power off
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:33.040]  oh we've all got to follow the law to have our power turned off you know why they'll put the
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:39.680]  engineers that give the orders and the power plants to up power in jail for 10 years look it up 10
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:47.360]  years for not following the federal order one time and so people said screw it power goes off i'm
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:51.680]  not going to prison for 10 years you understand the people at those places had the box cards had
[2:13:51.680 --> 2:13:59.840]  the fuel had the power ready to you're not getting it because a bunch of horrible scum want to sit
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:04.880]  there and starve you out and control you because they're globalist because they're at war with
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:09.360]  america yeah there's down the street from the office a line down the street of people trying to get
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:16.000]  into wendy's to eat a hamburger out of the power had been off for a week this is training you to
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:21.920]  live like a slave here's this monster who says you know how many barrels all you she doesn't care
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:26.880]  she's used to wear glasses and you know touch herself and and act all i'm a woman oh is it cool
[2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:30.800]  a woman runs the agency oh we're cutting your power off oh it's because of a man was cutting
[2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:34.960]  off people distinctively like some evil man got my power off but it's mommy oh look i have lipstick
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:42.400]  on you don't get me power you don't get me power and my frustration was we had the document and
[2:14:42.400 --> 2:14:46.960]  never even got out there other than the fact check i mean maybe my fellow texans don't know
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:51.840]  it's coming again and it's deliberate and they got f'd over so because we won't wake up and have
[2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:57.520]  basic instincts we're slaves here's this monster pig admitting this is a transition they're doing
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:04.160]  it on purpose here is your enemy but the bottom line is that this president and this administration
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:11.120]  are looking at every single tool to shield american families from the impact of rising
[2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:17.120]  energy prices and we're working through we're working through an energy transition and we've
[2:15:17.120 --> 2:15:24.560]  got to start by adding energy and the reality is we have to take some time to get off of oil and
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:30.720]  gas we recognize this this is a transition they're very serious about this you know how many barrels
[2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:37.600]  of oil does the u.s consume per day i don't have that number so some suggest it's about 18 million
[2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:42.000]  which would suggest you're releasing less than three days worth of supplies from the patrolling
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:48.640]  reserve yeah yeah it used to be over 30 million but they got better engines this woman is insane
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:53.280]  she's the energy secretary and doesn't know the most basic fact you like being santa claus and

[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:06.320]  planet is still unaware that there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side
[2:18:06.320 --> 2:18:11.760]  and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post human world from the
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:16.640]  united states of brazil and of course triggered by the briggs in the uk nations were pulling out of
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:21.840]  the private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched their great recess and
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:28.560]  their program after collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down
[2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:34.320]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:39.520]  wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:46.320]  they released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned about it about
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:51.600]  20 months ago it's that simple they can't maybe because of our free speech and our guns so the
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:56.720]  global corporate combine released gov 19 and you know the rest is history expose this paradigm and
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:06.240]  we win i'm sitting here it's in the early morning hours and i'm looking at mainstream news reporting
[2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:11.600]  on the fact that even the controlled revolving door fda has come out and said that the moderna
[2:19:11.600 --> 2:19:16.880]  and phyzer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because he and studies
[2:19:16.880 --> 2:19:22.320]  they did on children it caused myocarditis that starts swelling and heart attacks and then i
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:26.800]  noticed that even though this is even in the associated press it's not getting any circulation
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:30.960]  it's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places like instagram or twitter
[2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:36.800]  it's just crazy and then tauti was on tv just yesterday saying there's no damage from the
[2:19:36.800 --> 2:19:42.560]  vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody your conspiracy theorist if you say it it's just crazy and then
[2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:46.000]  we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are going to
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:51.440]  cause heart problems they gave the exact reasons why and now it happened that's why info wars is
[2:19:51.440 --> 2:19:56.240]  on air because if we weren't on air they get away with even more of this crap this is just insane
[2:19:56.240 --> 2:20:12.160]  these people are killers you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:22.400]  so i got bigger generators now around the whole info wars operation for weeks without power for
[2:20:22.400 --> 2:20:28.320]  the days and i'm just now sold my house so i'm getting dug in in the countryside
[2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:34.560]  but my shotgun arrived from a four-wheel drive my trailer my root seller
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:42.160]  now look at the average yuppie the average trendy having no idea what's about to hit him
[2:20:42.800 --> 2:20:49.040]  as the globalists devalue the dollar and destroy the border and sell our nation out as fast as they
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:55.360]  can look at these headlines dozens of ships stuck in arctic ice freezes early
[2:20:57.520 --> 2:21:01.760]  contradicting global warming claims uh yeah the arctic's bigger than it's ever been since they
[2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:08.880]  started having satellites so is the Antarctic oh but london guardian climate crisis pushes albatross
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:16.160]  divorce rates iron no it's the chemicals in the actual study show that's causing this but it doesn't
[2:21:16.160 --> 2:21:24.480]  matter hillary the horrible child molesting demon oh yeah she gets in on it i mean i've
[2:21:24.480 --> 2:21:30.960]  known that i've been exposing hillary and her her first job because you know the chicago mafia is
[2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:38.960]  based in uh hot springs in fact but people that haven't been to hot springs or don't know about
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:46.240]  arkansas don't don't know that the mafia use that from new york new jersey everywhere as their
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:54.160]  headquarters until um vegas got really going but but it was a mafia headquarters till the till the
[2:21:54.160 --> 2:22:03.680]  till the 80s and hillary first job was a defense lawyer for child molesters and not just child
[2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:11.440]  molesters brutal child kidnappers rich powerful men that like to rape and kill children and she
[2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:15.600]  famously brags about it and laughs how you know she'd know they kidnapped a ten-year-old girl off
[2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:20.000]  her front porch and take her and rape her for a couple days until her guts fell out she never
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:24.400]  could have babies again and then how she'd get them off and how funny it was and i could play the
[2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:29.760]  clip would you like me to play the clip but but see that's who she is she knew to go right to the
[2:22:29.760 --> 2:22:35.600]  bottom first with her daddy that was the deputy head of the mafia under mayor daly in chicago
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:42.800]  imagine you're a daddy and you send your daughter to go work for the mafia headquarters in little
[2:22:42.800 --> 2:22:50.960]  rock and hot springs arkansas hot springs really the main center and oh oh here's a photo coming
[2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:55.280]  out in the gisling maxwell trial here she is with bill clinton getting on the lowly to express
[2:22:55.280 --> 2:23:00.400]  which they flew on hundreds of times on the logs 26 times something the media tried to cover up
[2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:03.840]  remember the abc news reporter off air says yeah we've been ordered to cover all this up and she
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:08.960]  laughs about it it's funny she goes man i wish i could run it and i'd be really big she doesn't
[2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:14.960]  care about saving kids she cares about attention hey dumbass they try to kill you when you expose it
[2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:18.000]  you don't do it for fame you do it for the children you dumb wench
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:25.840]  so hillary went on mr madow show i'm not gonna play the whole thing and everything she says
[2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:30.640]  is an inversion everything she said oh my gosh there's all this fake dis info and hackers

[2:23:52.960 --> 2:24:01.120]  and i'm the torpedo you're not going to scare people by destroying me you're going to encourage
[2:24:01.120 --> 2:24:05.200]  them you're going to inspire them and that's what god wants that's what's going to happen
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:12.320]  but i'm not signed on with jeffrey eppstein and the giant government level run sex rings they use
[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:18.720]  to blackmail the intelligentsia and take control that system's going down and i wish everybody
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:23.680]  liberal conservative old young black white doesn't matter would join me in saying
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:28.080]  this corrupt ruling establishment needs to go away we define god again and have a revival
[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:33.200]  and stop lying and stop being evil here's uh hillary hit the emergency button hit the emergency
[2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:38.640]  button here it is and apple bomb essentially says if the 20th century was the story of slow
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:44.240]  uneven progress toward liberal democracy the 21st century so far is the story of the reverse
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:50.080]  she says you know not only what we're going on what's going on in the united states is a reversal
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:54.960]  away from democracy but we should see it as part of a global problem she identifies in particular
[2:24:54.960 --> 2:25:00.560]  that the authoritarian strongman regimes around the world are all helping each other including
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:04.640]  you know personally supporting other corrupt leaders in their corruption and helping them
[2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:12.480]  evade sanctions and stuff and it does feel both global and very hard to fight it feels almost
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:17.280]  inexorable and speaking with an apple bomb about that i found myself sort of in a dark place for
[2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:22.720]  a few days and i wanted to put that to you to find out whether you see that through through
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:27.120]  through a lens darkly as well or whether you're feeling more optimistic about strategy against it
[2:25:27.120 --> 2:25:40.400]  well rachel um i i am very worried concerned i spent a lot of time thinking about exactly what
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:47.760]  an apple bomb and you and others are worried about and trying to point out because i do think
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:56.640]  that we are facing a crisis of democracy a crisis of legitimacy a crisis that really
[2:25:56.640 --> 2:26:03.360]  goes to the heart of what the future of our country and many others around the world will be
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:13.600]  so i spend my time trying to figure out what we can do about it and i am not ever going to give up
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:20.560]  because there's just too much at stake but first and foremost we have to make sure more people
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:28.000]  besides people like you me and apple bomb and others who share our concerns see what we see
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:36.400]  because i think that the role of disinformation the way that propaganda has been really weaponized
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:43.760]  and the increasing ability to manipulate people through algorithms and other forms of artificial
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:52.800]  intelligence will only make this harder to combat so that's enough the full clips on info wars.com
[2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:59.200]  it's on youtube it's titled hillary clinton we have got to end impunity for people who undermine
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:04.960]  american laws oh you mean how you harass me and and and all that because i'm fighting you the tyrants

[2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:15.040]  doing you pointed us to go look there's the big powerful because there's some men what in eastern
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:19.040]  europe that don't want to go bankrupt and see their kids starve oh there's some men in south america
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:23.600]  aren't like bolsynaro oh there's a few men like me there's a few men that actually stand up to you
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:28.000]  monsters yes they're worried about the few men because they're the evil men with these women as
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.360]  their front people who are enslaving and hurting everybody and building an anti-human world
[2:27:34.720 --> 2:27:37.920]  and so yeah they're pissed they don't have russia under their full control they don't have

[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:49.360]  and this is just the beginning you monstrous child molesting devil worshiping sack of filth

[2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:10.560]  aren't dying you are politically already dead and i wish no harm upon hillary clinton i want her to

[2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:46.240]  all right ladies and gentlemen i'm going to be sitting in here for the remainder of the alex
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:51.680]  jones show we've got a couple segments here i'm going to get into some late uh breaking news right
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:59.280]  now and then we're going to be debuting here on the alex jones show a round table with general
[2:33:59.280 --> 2:34:04.720]  flan patrick burn alex jones and others that is just such key information and you have these
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:10.320]  these these powerhouse individuals fighting against tyranny that have a military background a media
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:15.840]  background a business background and so they see all the angles they see all the aspects they see
[2:34:15.840 --> 2:34:20.400]  how the new world order is being laid out attacking the individual attacking the individual rights
[2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:26.320]  and attacking the country and everything that it stands for uh that that's put us in such a position
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:31.040]  to be so prosperous here in the united states of america for the individual to be so prosperous here
[2:34:31.040 --> 2:34:35.920]  in the united states of america for so long it's the new world order it's the great reset it's
[2:34:35.920 --> 2:34:42.640]  coveted it's climate change uh it's all an attack against you and so to have uh a bunch of great men
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:48.400]  and women waking up to it standing up to that putting themselves in the line of the fire
[2:34:49.120 --> 2:34:53.120]  and that's why you see the subpoenas that's why you see the persecution that's why you see everything
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:35:00.320]  that's going down because look the global elite have an agenda and for them failure is not an option
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:06.080]  they want to conquer the planet they want to monopolize all the operating systems and infrastructure
[2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:11.840]  into the new world order they want to turn planet earth into a farm essentially that they control
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:17.520]  controlling all human movement controlling all carbon uh life cycles everything and they have to
[2:35:17.520 --> 2:35:27.920]  have full 100 compliance to complete this satanic demonic agenda so that's why they're going after
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:33.520]  the individuals that are standing on the front lines against it including many of us here at
[2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:40.080]  infowars so that's going to be coming up in about 30 minutes and and i just got to tell you this as
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:45.120]  well before i start to get into some of this news and and maybe we'll just even open up the phone
[2:35:45.120 --> 2:35:48.640]  lines because i'm going to be with you here not just on the remainder of the alex joneshow but
[2:35:48.640 --> 2:36:00.720]  then carrying through to the war room as well and and we'll be taking phone calls but there is some
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:06.880]  some breaking news i want to get into here and uh i just got to say though you know alex is working
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:12.480]  harder than ever i'm working harder than ever the crew is working harder than ever and we
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:18.800]  really do look at that as just paying it forward for your support you support us you keep us on
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:26.000]  air you pray for us you shop at infowarstore.com you make the donations on our legal fund uh defense

[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:39.040]  so i will just tell you and you're starting to see some of the plans that we had for the future
[2:36:39.040 --> 2:36:46.720]  the near future now starting to manifest starting to bear its fruits and of course you know all the
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:53.360]  best plans of mice and men uh go astray you know we had an idea hey we're going to make we're going
[2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:58.000]  to do these great projects we're going to launch them in december and january and then boom we
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:02.400]  get hit with more lawsuits boom we get hit with subpoenas boom we get hit with more censorship
[2:37:02.400 --> 2:37:10.160]  and so we're we're having all of these little side skirmishes and side fights and side battles
[2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:14.800]  as we're marching forward to expand in the info war as we're marching forward to keep
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:19.440]  this operation alive and that's all of us that's that's me that's alex that's this great crew
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:24.640]  that's you in the audience we're all in this together we're all in the crosshairs of the
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:30.880]  new world order takeover we just are standing at the front lines of it but that bullet will rip
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:36.080]  through us and go through everybody behind us as well there's the great crew right there everybody
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:42.880]  here wishing you a happy thanksgiving and uh we will be having a happy thanksgiving here as well

[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:08.240]  for more future attacks power grid shutdowns food shortages we're preparing for all that

[2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:33.600]  the emergency gear everything at infowarstore.com and and and and let me just do this too so i can
[2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:37.040]  even have a better idea of what we're going to do here for the next five and a half hours
[2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:46.240]  guys how long is the round table discussion with alex and with patrick burn and general flinn
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:53.440]  and everybody do we have a do we have an exact time on that because i
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:39:00.240]  so we should have time then to maybe take some phone calls before we go to that exclusively
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:12.320]  correct see everybody thinks there's like some grand master plan of info wars and we're working
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:18.240]  and scheming behind the scenes no folks this is all live never scripted never telepromptered
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:23.440]  just flying from the seat of our pants i mean i i've literally been actually shooting promos
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:27.360]  and ad reads and all kind of stuff since 10 a.m this morning i just got back in studio from doing
[2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:33.040]  all that just out in the scenes out in the field i just got back in studio like 20 minutes ago so
[2:39:33.040 --> 2:39:37.680]  so you know i'm trying to absorb this and get this prepared as well so let me just do this as kind of
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:42.880]  uh just to have prepared and i'll at least be able to take calls in the next segment and if
[2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:48.640]  you want to hold we can take them in the war room too so the number to call in 877-789-2539
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:54.880]  877-789-2539 not even mentioning that this isn't even my normal studio so i'm not even used to how
[2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:59.040]  this studio runs i don't have my normal board in front of me i don't have the other elements
[2:39:59.040 --> 2:40:03.680]  and the things that i'm used to so uh but that's all good folks we'll play in the rain we'll play
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:08.560]  in the snow we'll play in the hail we'll play in a hurricane we'll play while we're under attack
[2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:13.760]  that's just what we do here at info wars and that's why you're supported infowarstore.com
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:18.400]  keeping us on air is so important uh so so we'll definitely take some calls next segment maybe
[2:40:18.400 --> 2:40:21.680]  another segment after that then we're going to go to the roundtable discussion i'll be coming in
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:26.880]  and out of it then hosting the the war room where i'll be taking a lot of calls as well but
[2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:36.320]  but maybe i'll wait to get into that when the war room comes up here because i've got three big
[2:40:36.320 --> 2:40:41.040]  stories really and there's about six or seven stories i'm going to get into but there's really
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:46.080]  three big stories that i really want to highlight today and two of them are kind of a two-in-one
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:55.200]  package comparing and contrasting in a short window of time the kyle rittenhouse verdict
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:41:05.200]  and media coverage versus the amad arbery verdict and media coverage there is a big story here
[2:41:05.760 --> 2:41:12.000]  that you already probably know or assume but that we can now lay out and flesh out as both of these
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:17.440]  cases have been closed looking at how the media covers it and looking at how the verdict is
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:22.880]  reached and then looking at the public's response there's a big story there and and it leads up to
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:29.840]  the larger story which is this this headline in the washington times which has been rewritten
[2:41:29.840 --> 2:41:38.000]  and remade probably dozens of times now george soros backed district attorneys are ruining america
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:47.360]  justice in this country is under serious threat right now and it's not just the threat of left
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:53.360]  wing ideologues that want to take justice into their own hands because they're just democrat party
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:42:00.080]  activists on a bench they want to take justice into their own hands and and they have preconceived
[2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:06.080]  notions and they have biases that they take right to the bench with them these are the people soros
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:15.120]  is trying to get into power but there's also the fact that they are just buying justices
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:23.760]  soros is just buying benches and judgeships uh with all the funding that he's doing the fund
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:29.120]  raising that he's doing and so you have to understand when the when the when judges in this country
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:38.320]  are bought and paid for by people like george soros or enter the bench with their democrat
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:43.920]  party activism fueling them to take justice into their own hands thinking they're the social justice
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:49.520]  warrior heroes using their bias acting like it's a good thing that is a serious problem for america
[2:42:49.520 --> 2:42:53.840]  that a lot of people aren't talking about it but we'll talk about it right here at info wars when

[2:45:29.760 --> 2:45:35.280]  system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us

[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:35.200]  i'm going to do two segments of calls and then we're going to play the round table discussion
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:39.680]  with mike plin and patrick bern alex joe's and others going to debut it here on the alex joe
[2:47:39.680 --> 2:47:49.200]  show but i found this sarcastic comment from gg lavangi pretty on point before i go to your
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:54.720]  phone calls here the silent outpouring of support from hollywood for the victims of the christmas
[2:47:54.720 --> 2:48:00.800]  parade massacre is heartwarming of course there has been no outpouring of support nothing at all
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:07.360]  complete silence but oh when a career criminal who's held a pregnant woman at gunpoint overdosed on
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:14.480]  drugs resists arrests and then and then dies in the complications every athlete and their mama has
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:19.280]  to comment and tell you how great of a hero george florida's when when he was anything but doesn't
[2:48:19.280 --> 2:48:24.880]  mean his death was justified that day it was still sad uh it was a bad day for america obviously but
[2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:33.040]  oh when a radical bigoted leftist it's now confirmed now he was an anti-white bigot we have we have
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:36.960]  all the information and uh i'm gonna i'm gonna cover all this coming up on the war i'm gonna take
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:44.640]  some calls now but think about that nothing nothing from hollywood nothing from professional
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:50.640]  athletes nothing from the media that covers them zero zilch nada on the christmas parade massacre
[2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:58.160]  that injured 50 people at least killed six people that we know of and just nothing just absolutely
[2:48:58.160 --> 2:49:03.520]  nothing but oh everyone's gonna comment on how bad cal written house is everyone's gonna comment
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:14.080]  about george floyd but then when you have a radical bigoted leftist terrorist that murders six people
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:22.320]  so far injured 50 others complete silence from all those same voices that were quick to rush to
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:29.440]  judgment of cal written house or of the george floyd situation so uh wow just so much heartwarming
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:33.760]  support from hollywood and our professional athletes about the christmas parade massacre
[2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:37.840]  you guys are just such great role models you really care about the truth in america so much
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:44.880]  no your dirt bad communist scum that falls for the same mainstream media propaganda that you
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:49.840]  would probably prop yourself up against claiming your anti-establishment when you do the bidding
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:54.320]  of the very establishment you claim to fight but let's go to some phone calls here
[2:49:54.320 --> 2:50:03.920]  here and we've got let's see what we want to do here let's go to jack who is in wisconsin
[2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:07.200]  as we talk about this case jack in wisconsin you're on the air go ahead
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:14.240]  hey uh mr. stroyer i was um wondering if i could use your platform and maybe you could
[2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:20.000]  help or your crew could help i was looking at the pictures yesterday of when uh mr brooks
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:28.240]  was in court for his initial appearance and on his shoulder uh he has a tattoo that says in one
[2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:38.240]  picture it looks like b s e uh bravo sierra echo and another it looks like b s b uh bravo sierra
[2:50:38.240 --> 2:50:48.400]  bravo and um i looked on the fbi gang registry list for tattoos and uh there's you know black
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:54.560]  supremacist extremist and brotherhood um used before but you know i really wanted to see if
[2:50:54.560 --> 2:51:00.080]  maybe you could or your staff could find out about that because i think that would be further
[2:51:00.080 --> 2:51:04.960]  evidence towards it being a hate crime if you have a giant tattoo for you know it'd be considered
[2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:10.160]  like a spostacon on your chest well let's just let's just put it this way because i don't have
[2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:14.000]  these images or this information in front of me but i have enough information in front of me
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:19.600]  where they'll they'll come out if it's call written house or something else and they'll
[2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:25.280]  immediately say oh white supremacist white racist with no evidence no proof nothing just jumping
[2:51:25.280 --> 2:51:31.600]  to conclusions when we have all kinds of anecdotal evidence that the christmas parade massacre was
[2:51:31.600 --> 2:51:37.120]  motivated by left wing radicals on mainstream media and in the democrat party and that he
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:42.320]  was indeed an anti-white bigot we saw it in his social media posts we saw in his rap songs i mean
[2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:49.600]  even the daily mail is covering it it's just so obvious walkesha suspect shared social media posts
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:56.800]  promoting violence towards white people two old white people knock them the f out and so there's
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:52:01.600]  all this other stuff so i'm not sure about the tattoos that you're speaking about i haven't
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:06.480]  seen them maybe there is something there it would just be you know adding on to the pile of evidence
[2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:14.160]  that this was a radical left-wing terrorist whose hatred was fueled by the left-wing politics of
[2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:20.160]  mainstream media and the democrat party and so and i'm going to get more to this on the war room
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:26.720]  but i've got all the stories here and i did the compare and contrast and there's all these headlines
[2:52:26.720 --> 2:52:33.920]  talking about the amed arbery murder where the there was a there was a decision made today that
[2:52:33.920 --> 2:52:39.120]  all three of them were found guilty of murder and all these headlines are white men white men
[2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:46.720]  white men white men white men white men white men but you look at all the stories from
[2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:53.280]  daryl brooks and nobody wants to mention that he's black nobody mentioned he was a black terrorist
[2:52:53.280 --> 2:52:57.920]  nobody mentions he was a black man so when it's when it's whitey make sure everybody knows that
[2:52:57.920 --> 2:53:03.120]  the bad guy's white and make sure people think it's white supremacy but oh and it's the black guy
[2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:07.760]  that actually talks about how he's a black supremacist that actually talks about how racist he is
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:12.560]  towards white people then they don't want to mention that he's a black man now a criminal is a criminal
[2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:17.280]  a bad guy is a bad guy no matter what colorist skin is that should be how we approach all of this
[2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:23.440]  stuff and i feel dirty even getting into the racial aspects of this because it's so antithetical to
[2:53:23.440 --> 2:53:29.280]  what i want to do here but that's just the case the media protects black terrorists and the media
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:33.360]  treats white people like every single one of them as a terrorist so as far as the tattoos you're
[2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:37.120]  talking about i can't really comment i haven't really seen them but it's pretty clear now more
[2:53:37.120 --> 2:53:42.960]  than ever based on the media coverage of these two incidents call written house and amad arbery
[2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:49.120]  the media is racist it's blatantly racist against white people and for whatever reason it feels the
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:55.360]  need to protect people from from uh or protect black people that commit crimes with all their
[2:53:55.360 --> 2:53:59.600]  coverage so white person commits a crime they make sure everybody knows it's a white person
[2:53:59.600 --> 2:54:03.520]  and then they spend the narrative that it's a white supremacist black person commits a crime
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:07.840]  and he's not even black in fact he didn't even commit the crime i've got the headlines
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:14.720]  they're officially calling it cbs news abc news wikipedia a car crash they're calling it a car
[2:54:14.720 --> 2:54:21.040]  crash so the media is just so evil and and so racist it's just unbelievable jack thank you for the
[2:54:21.040 --> 2:54:29.280]  call all right let's go to kim kim's calling in from arkansas kim you're on the alex joneshow go
[2:54:29.280 --> 2:54:37.840]  ahead uh yes um i was just wanting to say that um there's a um side effect of the vaccines that
[2:54:37.840 --> 2:54:48.560]  they're now calling uh with the acronym um b i c t no vascular um intravenous um thrombinic transfer
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:55.600]  or something like that it occurs after you take it um and that's my last name because i'm a little
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:55:07.680]  bit nervous there uh okay well i do know this wendy williams who's been on tv for years she's
[2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:14.160]  taking the vaccine and there's a bunch of commentary and rumors about what's happened to
[2:55:14.160 --> 2:55:19.360]  wendy williams you may remember famously one day she just like zoned out and passed out on live
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:25.600]  television it was one of the weirdest things in live tv history well apparently and there's a lot of
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:31.440]  commentary out there i don't know what can be confirmed at this point but uh other than she
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:37.040]  it looks like wendy williams is no longer going to be able to host her tv show anymore
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:41.520]  and some people are saying she has dementia some people are saying she's having horrible
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:47.360]  side effects on the vaccine and so she just can't do it anymore so it's just another incident
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:54.160]  where you didn't see any of this last year i mean celebrities dying left and right athletes dying
[2:55:54.160 --> 2:56:02.000]  left and right all kinds of health problems left and right and nobody's making the obvious analysis
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:08.880]  which is how come this is happening post vaccine but not pre vaccine there is a uh there is a
[2:56:08.880 --> 2:56:15.600]  relevance there yes and i could be bitter cold you know that's the bad um yeah it makes me a
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:24.720]  little bit nervous that another bar in my life saying that well look i uh thank you for the call
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:29.360]  kim i i i hope the best for wendy williams it's sad she's not going to be able to host her tv
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:38.000]  show anymore but i mean how how evil is it that the media will do everything they can even when
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:43.920]  their own people getting hurt by these vaccines their own children i mean the left is literally
[2:56:43.920 --> 2:56:48.400]  watching their children get damaged by these vaccines they're watching their loved ones die
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:54.400]  of these vaccines and in the greatest example of stockholm syndrome in modern history oh my kid
[2:56:54.400 --> 2:56:59.360]  got the vaccine and died that's why you should get the vaccine oh my grandfather got the vaccine
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:04.320]  and died that's why you should get the vaccine oh uh you know this person got the vaccine and died
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:08.720]  but it could have been worse if they didn't get the vaccine really what's worse than death the
[2:57:08.720 --> 2:57:13.760]  the hoops that they'll jump through the levels of lies that they'll tell to protect this roll
[2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:19.120]  out of the vaccine it's the greatest example of stockholm syndrome in modern day history
[2:57:20.400 --> 2:57:25.520]  i mean it's it's putting a gun to your head pulling the trigger blowing your brains out
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:31.600]  and then as your soul is going up to heaven or down to hell you're saying i love blowing my
[2:57:31.600 --> 2:57:36.640]  brains out it's the greatest thing i ever did for my life you should do it too and then it's
[2:57:36.640 --> 2:57:41.920]  pill gates and fouchy ringing their hands saying yeah blow your brains out with that gun it's
[2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:49.920]  going to be good for you and then they'll have to eat it up there are so many crappy brands

[2:59:02.240 --> 2:59:11.360]  world in incredible ways and now as 2021 prepares the end at 2022 begins to dawn it is more important

[2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:49.600]  hours clean energy back and stop the free shipping 40 off and so many other great projects leading
[2:59:49.600 --> 2:59:55.200]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:59:55.200 --> 3:00:15.520]  ladies and gentlemen i have to tell you i have just had a major epiphany in the last 90 seconds
[3:00:16.240 --> 3:00:22.560]  i'm not even kidding you you notice and the latest here is rob reiner but
[3:00:22.560 --> 3:00:30.400]  but these uh these leptis liars they're they're they're everywhere they're a dime a dozen but they
[3:00:30.400 --> 3:00:36.160]  keep promoting all of these myths and and let's just focus on the call written out but i mean
[3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:39.920]  they they they promote the lies of russian collusion they promote the lies of the vaccine
[3:00:39.920 --> 3:00:43.840]  safe and effective i mean you can name it whatever lie that they promote on the left it just it
[3:00:43.840 --> 3:00:50.640]  never ceases uh it never stops and so rob reiner just put out a tweet saying the the grand lie
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:55.040]  that got disproven in court that call written house crossed state lines with a rifle never
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:00:59.920]  happened literally never happened uh but they just keep lying about it and i and i had a major epiphany
[3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:11.200]  now i've always looked at it self uh you know respectively as probably a detrimental thing
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:18.720]  for my personality perhaps not if i'm doing this as a job but i've always had an obsession with
[3:01:18.720 --> 3:01:24.720]  being right it's it again it you know maybe it's a detrimental thing for a personality to have to be
[3:01:24.720 --> 3:01:29.440]  to just constantly have to be right right everybody knows so he just has to be right he
[3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:32.720]  just has to be right well well that's that's something that i've had i've always had that
[3:01:32.720 --> 3:01:37.520]  i've always just had to be right about everything and i recognize that and you know you try to
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:45.600]  have a sense of that pride and not make it an issue socially but it just hit me if i have this
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:52.960]  overwhelming desire and drive to be right about everything because everything has an opposite
[3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:59.120]  it's the yin and yang of the universe it's the it's the duality of man do people have the same
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:05.760]  desire to be wrong i'm not even saying this facetiously i i i really believe that we might
[3:02:05.760 --> 3:02:12.720]  be witnessing something that we've never realized before that cuts to the core of the mental illness
[3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:20.000]  this known as liberalism i have a need to be right all the time maybe many of you out in this audience
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:25.120]  can relate to that are there people that are on the opposite side of this spectrum in the
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:31.680]  dichotomy of man in the duality of man that need to be wrong is that seriously is that what we're
[3:02:31.680 --> 3:02:39.520]  dealing with does rob reiner have a weird desire to be wrong all the time i mean should i start
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:48.960]  naming it rachel madow chris haze joy reed don laman i mean the list just goes on and on and on
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:56.560]  do they have a desire to be wrong do they have to be wrong is there some weird psychological
[3:02:56.560 --> 3:03:04.720]  operating procedure behind them that they just want to be wrong all the time is it a gag is it a
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:10.160]  is it a weird like gotcha thing that they just get enjoyment out of lying to people and deceiving
[3:03:10.160 --> 3:03:17.360]  people i'm really i really think that there might be something to this so we have to i think we
[3:03:17.360 --> 3:03:23.360]  have to now start understanding this to be to be the case whether or not it's something psychologically
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:27.520]  that they're doing consciously or whether it's something they can't even perceive in their
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:34.880]  and their subconscious liberals have a desire to be wrong they really do and the evidence is
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:41.840]  everywhere look at all the polls that i cover all the time where you'll you'll they do polls and
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:46.160]  they pull democrats and they pull republicans uh one of the latest examples is they pulled
[3:03:46.160 --> 3:03:51.440]  democrats and they said did call written house kill black people 50 percent of democrats believe
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:55.840]  that call written house shot black people well call written house didn't shot a shoot a single
[3:03:55.840 --> 3:04:01.920]  black person they were all white people but there's that desire to be wrong democrats and liberals
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:09.600]  have a desire to be wrong they have a need to be wrong i and i and i look at it as a personality
[3:04:09.600 --> 3:04:15.280]  defect that i need to make sure i'm not overwhelming people with socially my desire and need to be
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:24.240]  right all the time but at least it's it's healthy in a in a sense of communication and in a sense of
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:30.080]  human activity liberals have a desire to be wrong i am now completely convinced i am having a
[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:36.480]  revelation here right now as we speak liberals have a desire to be wrong they really do i have
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:41.600]  a need to be right it's my own thing i have to recognize and deal with they have a need to be
[3:04:41.600 --> 3:04:47.760]  wrong and whether it's conscious or or or subconscious we're seeing it every day democrats
[3:04:47.760 --> 3:04:53.120]  think cops killed a thousand unarmed black men a year it's 20 democrats seriously they have a
[3:04:53.120 --> 3:05:01.520]  desire to be wrong about everything the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual
[3:05:01.520 --> 3:05:07.360]  warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that
[3:05:07.360 --> 3:05:13.360]  not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and
[3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:19.040]  the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that
[3:05:19.040 --> 3:05:26.560]  saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be
[3:05:26.560 --> 3:05:33.040]  necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all
[3:05:33.040 --> 3:05:40.080]  their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end
[3:05:40.080 --> 3:05:44.960]  they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody
[3:05:44.960 --> 3:05:49.600]  keep info wars on the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god what the
[3:05:49.600 --> 3:05:55.120]  globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government
[3:05:55.120 --> 3:06:01.360]  and the mark of the beast they just announced all right ladies and gentlemen here's what we're
[3:06:01.360 --> 3:06:06.080]  going to be doing let me give you a programming notice i have a lot of callers on the line from

[3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:40.560]  powerful round table discussion between alex jones mike flinn patrick burn and others a meeting of
[3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:46.000]  the minds experts in media experts in military experts in business sitting down to talk about
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:51.280]  how we can defeat the great reset and save human freedom worldwide it debuts right now on the alex
[3:06:51.280 --> 3:06:57.840]  joneshow here it is well now we're joined by patrick burn and of course joe flinn a brother of
[3:06:57.840 --> 3:07:03.760]  the general and super active in making films and exposing the globalist and wow uh we're going to
[3:07:03.760 --> 3:07:09.040]  to start back right where we left off pat and that's what the whole january six so-called
[3:07:09.040 --> 3:07:12.880]  investigation they've got going and then the big question is how do we get this got around for
[3:07:12.880 --> 3:07:18.320]  president oh that's a good that's a well on the january sixth thing i heard mike close off saying
[3:07:18.320 --> 3:07:23.520]  why don't they send send my opinion to pat burn is i think he's drawing attention to an odd
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:29.840]  phenomenon which is i since the middle of december january six wasn't my idea but i was out there
[3:07:29.840 --> 3:07:36.000]  on the radio since mid december encouraging people to come for january four through january six
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:40.960]  peaceably rally piece i emphasized peace i wrote about it but i did in all these interviews for a
[3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:47.200]  month and yet no one's asked to talk to me and i've taken out a full page ad actually about hey
[3:07:47.200 --> 3:07:51.440]  congress i asked for this why don't you talk to me they they're mounting this whole big
[3:07:51.440 --> 3:07:56.160]  investigation but for some reason alex they're leaving they won't give and uh i've even i took
[3:07:56.160 --> 3:08:00.960]  out this full they wash and post turned down the ad so i put it up on the internet and the examiner
[3:08:00.960 --> 3:08:05.680]  let me take a out of front page ad pointing to it and it's it's saying to congress hey if you want
[3:08:05.680 --> 3:08:10.560]  to talk to who's be if you want to get to the bottom january six come ask me do you know sometimes
[3:08:10.560 --> 3:08:15.280]  remember the matrix when the black cat stutters it's your little hint that you're watching the matrix
[3:08:15.280 --> 3:08:20.160]  that something's wrong isn't it odd that the guy who is probably out there second only to trump
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:25.520]  calling for this and i'm out there saying hey i did it i acknowledge it have me in for some reason
[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:28.960]  they won't they they dare not mention my name what do you think that's about well don't you're the
[3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:36.160]  expert tell us why they don't want you to be there oh there's a you we i wouldn't even know where to
[3:08:36.160 --> 3:08:41.360]  begin to explain why they don't want me this is synopsis uh there's a lot of things there's so many
[3:08:41.360 --> 3:08:47.200]  reasons they don't want well but for one reason is i'm going to take the position so first of all i
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:51.920]  have said you know i've very clearly asked for it to be peaceful and i do condone the actions of any
[3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:56.880]  mag of people who got unruly i think by the way every time you were on my show previous january
[3:08:56.880 --> 3:09:01.600]  six you would obsess on let's be peaceful and let's not be violent let's not be raised like you were
[3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:06.160]  yeah on january six but you were you were smarter than i was a really hammered well i was i mean i
[3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:10.000]  would have it as a footnote but you were like hammer hammer well i was afraid of a sigh up and
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:15.760]  was and i think what happened well i would welcome a real honest investigation and i think we don't
[3:09:15.760 --> 3:09:21.040]  know yet for sure what happened i'd honest i'd love a welcome i would welcome an honest investigation
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:25.280]  so but and i do want to condemn the people who got you know they might say we got suckered into
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:30.560]  it by antifa dressed as maga it could be but in any case they got suckered and maga you know the
[3:09:30.560 --> 3:09:36.240]  old saying is shame uh fool me one shame on you fool me twice shame on me never gets suckered
[3:09:36.240 --> 3:09:41.280]  and there's going to be opportunities right now starting this week to rally never be a sucker again
[3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:45.440]  you got suckered on january six we're not going to let it happen again but i'm also going to take
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:50.560]  the position of congress asked that the the concerns of the rally goers have been vindicated
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:54.800]  not their behavior but their concerns have been vindicated because of the maricopa audit and
[3:09:54.800 --> 3:09:59.200]  numerous other things that have come to life and there are other reasons congress does not want me
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:03.600]  in front of them so it's so odd that they will not invite from all the people although they're
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:08.240]  making such a big show of getting to the bottom of january six here i am i'm the guy who was on
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:12.960]  television and radio asking for it i'm ready to take responsibility they weren't well i had a blind
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:16.960]  spot because i've been to so many trump rallies and everybody's been so peaceful we got a million
[3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:21.760]  people there maybe 500 got tricked into doing some things they shouldn't have but but i was really
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:27.520]  blindsided with the fact that secret service told us to go meet the president there but then there
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:31.680]  was no secret service or extra military there and i know trump requested a week before ten
[3:10:31.680 --> 3:10:36.000]  thousand national guard and was denied because i guess that comes down to the district of columbia
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:39.600]  i know the general could probably speak to that but i mean they tried to really set us up and i'm
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:43.280]  not saying the secret service themselves did it but somebody told them to come get me out of the
[3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:47.760]  crowd to lead it uh and thank god a lot of the crowd already left so they were unable to blame it
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:52.800]  on me if i got there right at the start they could have set me and others up easily easily why don't
[3:10:52.800 --> 3:10:57.600]  we like the gate i think that's what the game plan was i i truly think that was the game plan
[3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:01.440]  makes no sense to me they knew there was going to be there was probably a million people in
[3:11:01.440 --> 3:11:06.560]  washington that day we were all there it made no sense to me that they're that that capital
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:12.560]  building was not barric was not already surrounded by national guard or or extra marshals or whoever
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:16.880]  it was they knew they knew they're going to be that many people and they probably had some intel
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:21.360]  that some of those people were going to be unruly and nothing more they planted them or they planted
[3:11:21.360 --> 3:11:26.160]  those people or they planted i mean we know this we know we know that you know there's a lot of
[3:11:26.160 --> 3:11:32.640]  video evidence and if they ever if they ever truly do this correctly in the court of law where all
[3:11:32.640 --> 3:11:38.240]  evidence is brought to bear for for especially for some of these defendants you know all the video
[3:11:38.240 --> 3:11:43.280]  that that we still that has not been exposed video from this video cameras everywhere in
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:48.560]  washington dc trust me folks there's video cameras on every building in every corner
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:53.360]  especially around that capital they have all this stuff i mean if somebody jumped through a window
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:58.320]  grabbed a cop and threw him on the ground i got it you know but but there's a lot of people right
[3:11:58.320 --> 3:12:03.680]  now that are in pretrial who haven't even been charged yet still and they're in this they're in
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:09.600]  this horrible prison that marjorie taylor green has done an extraordinary job of starting to expose
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:14.320]  and they were they were fighting a congresswoman in this case they were fighting to keep her from
[3:12:14.320 --> 3:12:21.360]  being able to even go in there to see it i mean you know but a legal tradition of congress of
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:26.400]  congressional people being supposed to be able to be inspecting prisons with well i mean they
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:29.920]  should be able to it should be no problem what are we hiding this is the united states of america
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:36.320]  i mean i mean we're talking about these are the justice system the department of justice right
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:42.320]  department of justice owns the prison bureau and so they they they should be able to open them all
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:45.920]  up in fact they're responsible for making sure that the you know that the conditions are fine
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:50.560]  and all that so i don't i don't want to go down the the rat hole that because i think that there
[3:12:50.560 --> 3:12:55.280]  are a couple of congressmen that are that are actually pointing that out and exposing it but
[3:12:55.280 --> 3:13:03.520]  the bigger issue is is this attack on our basic right to be able to speak freely about what i feel
[3:13:03.520 --> 3:13:09.360]  right if i feel like there was fraud in the election and and in some cases it's been proven
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:14.480]  i should be able to say that and even if it hasn't been proven i feel like there's fraud in the
[3:13:14.480 --> 3:13:20.720]  you know if i feel like saying something you know about you and i want to say it publicly
[3:13:20.720 --> 3:13:26.560]  i can say it you might smack me in the face but that's okay i mean but that's a consequence but
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:32.320]  in this case what we're talking about is we're being told to shut our mouths go home and and
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:39.920]  don't don't tell us what rights you have okay and they're going to put the fear of of of all of
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:45.200]  this stuff so when they subpoena all these people for this kind of for this type of activity that
[3:13:45.200 --> 3:13:49.280]  they're that they describe what they're really doing is they're saying to the american people
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:54.400]  it's like what happened to me early on they're saying to the american people we can do this to him
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:59.680]  and we can do this to you so if you do this we're going to come after you so you just shut your
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:06.080]  little mouths and you go back to you know whatever middle america and don't worry we'll tell you
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:11.440]  what to do and we're going to tell you what the outcome is going to be that's a that's a total
[3:14:11.440 --> 3:14:18.480]  attack on our on all of our rights it's an inversion of the most basic principle in our system
[3:14:18.480 --> 3:14:24.480]  in our system we are the principal governments the agent like if joe is the homeowner and i'm
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:29.200]  mowing his lawn for him he pays me to mow his lawn he's the principal i'm the agent in that
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:33.600]  relationship i'm doing what he says that's why if i am reckless and i break your neighbor's window
[3:14:33.600 --> 3:14:37.600]  or something they can come for him because he was the principal i'm just the agent where your real
[3:14:37.600 --> 3:14:44.080]  estate is your agent in our political system we the citizens are the principals and government is
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:49.280]  the agent it's something we've formed in order to do some things we couldn't do ourselves or
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:54.400]  estates and there's a nice and discreet list of them article one section eight and the common
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:58.400]  thing the thing they all have in common are the things that we could not do as individuals or
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:04.640]  estates uh and so that's the basis of the relationship and but what you're seeing across
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:11.280]  the political spectrum is this inversion and it's happening everywhere from the looking at election
[3:15:11.280 --> 3:15:17.920]  audits to the school board here you have you know the a termic call of practicing what looked like
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:24.000]  a very well rehearsed line and focus group tested line about we have to get over this idea that
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:28.800]  parents should get to decide what their children are taught that was a real crossing of the rubicon
[3:15:28.800 --> 3:15:33.440]  that's inverting all right ladies and gentlemen you're seeing it right here this is a very powerful
[3:15:33.440 --> 3:15:41.600]  round table i am sitting here listening along with you at home or on the road wherever you may be
[3:15:42.880 --> 3:15:48.720]  and we are going to come right back with it right after this short break alex jones michael
[3:15:48.720 --> 3:15:59.280]  flin joe flin patrick burn breaking it all down when we return if you're ruthless mega corporations
[3:15:59.280 --> 3:16:03.920]  who've taken over almost every government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class
[3:16:03.920 --> 3:16:08.800]  in any form of upper mobility you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:15.680]  being targeted that's why the fortune 100 have wrapped themselves the name of lb gt and african
[3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:20.000]  american rights and all the rest of it all over the world that's now their corporate face while
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:25.280]  they run slave camps in africa and in communist china and many other areas while they undermine
[3:16:25.280 --> 3:16:30.240]  our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech in the central banks of the other zone
[3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:37.760]  so this is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass it's the politicians it's the
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:43.040]  corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's members of congress and their staff and their
[3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:48.320]  families it's the white house hell it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison
[3:16:49.040 --> 3:16:54.320]  shots but not the general public and everybody else through corporate rule so this is the true
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:17:00.880]  discrimination that's going on today anyone who is awake can clearly see why alex jones was deep
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:07.120]  platform info wars was right above the target and the globalists were a year out from launching
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:13.920]  their attack three years later and info wars is still thriving thanks to the support of our audience

[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:25.920]  entrenched within our government are breaking the justice system more than ever in their attack
[3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:33.840]  against alex jones no crime no evidence no jury no trial we don't think so they want to kill the
[3:17:33.840 --> 3:17:40.720]  messenger in a kangaroo trial with their new ussa but we won't let them alex jones will have his

[3:18:59.420 --> 3:19:01.020]  Jacob and Ohio, welcome go ahead
[3:19:01.040 --> 3:19:02.240]  Hey how's it going Alex?
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:03.100]  Good what?
[3:19:03.100 --> 3:19:04.020]  There's a great last caller
[3:19:04.020 --> 3:19:06.840]  I just wanted to start with lugging your sleek supplement
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:09.880]  It's basically the only way I get in a sleek any more
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:13.000]  All the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:14.880]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:16.600]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[3:19:16.600 --> 3:19:17.960]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:19.480]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:21.320]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:22.520]  for one of the products.
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:24.200]  The X2 does wonders.
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:25.440]  They recommend it to everybody.
[3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:26.520]  You're on the fence about it.
[3:19:26.520 --> 3:19:29.400]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info ward.
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:31.280]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[3:19:31.280 --> 3:19:32.280]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:34.040]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:34.880]  It's an honor.
[3:19:34.880 --> 3:19:35.720]  Honored talk to you.
[3:19:35.720 --> 3:19:36.640]  Awesome.
[3:19:36.640 --> 3:19:40.200]  So, first thing I wanted to do was to say I love the products.
[3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:43.720]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[3:19:43.720 --> 3:19:46.120]  she loves it and it helps with the bedroom.
[3:19:46.120 --> 3:19:48.000]  So, just number one for a few of us there.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:48.840]  I like that one, it works.
[3:19:48.840 --> 3:19:50.360]  It's not a joke, yeah.
[3:19:50.360 --> 3:20:16.920]  Absolutely.
[3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:20.280]  We're back live on the Alex Jones show, but we now go.
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:24.400]  Back to the round table with General Flynn, Patrick Byrne,
[3:20:24.400 --> 3:20:28.680]  Alex Jones, and more, right here live.
[3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:32.880]  That thought, because so what you just said, what he just said,
[3:20:32.880 --> 3:20:38.280]  and this is the essence of why this country right now,
[3:20:38.280 --> 3:20:40.680]  this is what gives me the hope that I have,
[3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:42.520]  because that crossing of the Rubicon,
[3:20:42.520 --> 3:20:48.880]  that crossing of that line, moms, mothers, and their children,
[3:20:48.880 --> 3:20:52.320]  they don't see politics, they just see their children.
[3:20:52.320 --> 3:20:56.720]  And so, I'll bet you, and I don't know the data,
[3:20:56.720 --> 3:21:00.440]  but you go look at the data in Virginia,
[3:21:00.440 --> 3:21:02.080]  and I'll bet you there's a lot of people
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:05.200]  that are on the other side of that center line
[3:21:05.200 --> 3:21:07.560]  because they care about their children.
[3:21:07.560 --> 3:21:10.280]  And they said, you know what, I don't like this particular guy
[3:21:10.280 --> 3:21:12.120]  because he crossed that line.
[3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:13.360]  That's a huge thing.
[3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:16.720]  And that's national, that is going on nationwide.
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:19.400]  And it's going on nationwide because of what we talked
[3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:23.280]  about earlier, Alex, about the Justice Department describing
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:26.200]  moms, primarily moms, as domestic terrorists,
[3:21:26.200 --> 3:21:28.680]  because they care about taking care of their damn children.
[3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:30.560]  Never in American history would we ever see it.
[3:21:30.560 --> 3:21:33.000]  I think it's important, one thing we're missing also is,
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:35.800]  think about how much the Democrats screamed and yelled
[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:38.280]  in 2016 about how the election was stolen,
[3:21:38.280 --> 3:21:40.960]  how the Russians stole the election on behalf of Trump.
[3:21:40.960 --> 3:21:43.520]  You mentioned the documentary earlier, Mike.
[3:21:43.520 --> 3:21:44.520]  It's called Kill Chain.
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:46.160]  Everybody should watch Kill Chain.
[3:21:46.160 --> 3:21:49.120]  The stars of Kill Chain are Senator Ron Wyden,
[3:21:49.120 --> 3:21:53.360]  Morgan, super liberal, Amy Klobuchar, and others talking
[3:21:53.360 --> 3:21:55.000]  about Dick Blumenthal.
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:55.840]  Dick Blumenthal.
[3:21:55.840 --> 3:21:57.400]  The fake, the fake battery bomb.
[3:21:57.400 --> 3:22:01.880]  Yeah, that movie talked about how they were deeply
[3:22:01.880 --> 3:22:06.080]  investigating the flaws in election voting machines.
[3:22:06.080 --> 3:22:09.120]  Now, all of a sudden, you know, fast forward to 2020.
[3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:12.760]  Here are conservatives or pro-America people dealing
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:15.720]  with a situation where we saw obvious fraud.
[3:22:15.720 --> 3:22:17.480]  And we're talking about it.
[3:22:17.480 --> 3:22:19.040]  We're fighting about it.
[3:22:19.040 --> 3:22:21.880]  We're exercising our First Amendment rights.
[3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:23.280]  And we're domestic terrorists.
[3:22:23.280 --> 3:22:24.280]  We're white supremacists.
[3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:27.120]  All kinds of labels being thrown at us.
[3:22:27.120 --> 3:22:29.760]  This cannot stand in this country.
[3:22:29.760 --> 3:22:32.400]  Our First Amendment rights and our voting rights
[3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:34.120]  are the most sacred things we have, Alex.
[3:22:34.120 --> 3:22:35.840]  Expand on that too, just briefly,
[3:22:35.840 --> 3:22:39.040]  because we've only got two mics here today, folks.
[3:22:39.040 --> 3:22:41.520]  Expand on that, because I know you helped make Deep Ring,
[3:22:41.520 --> 3:22:42.560]  all those things.
[3:22:42.560 --> 3:22:44.920]  They've been trying to censor films and even censoring
[3:22:44.920 --> 3:22:47.080]  clips of the Democrat film you talked about
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:48.120]  off Twitter and Facebook.
[3:22:48.120 --> 3:22:50.360]  They're a film about fraud, because it's not something
[3:22:50.360 --> 3:22:51.160]  we're allowed to discuss.
[3:22:51.160 --> 3:22:52.960]  This is unprecedented tyranny.
[3:22:52.960 --> 3:22:54.720]  Yeah, I don't think a lot of people
[3:22:54.720 --> 3:22:56.280]  know about that movie, Kill Chain.
[3:22:56.280 --> 3:22:57.880]  You can get it, actually, on Netflix.
[3:22:57.880 --> 3:23:00.480]  I encourage everyone, Democrats, Republicans, whoever,
[3:23:00.480 --> 3:23:02.200]  watch that movie, because what it talks about
[3:23:02.200 --> 3:23:03.280]  is election fraud.
[3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:06.280]  And this was 2018, 2017.
[3:23:06.280 --> 3:23:10.400]  So we decided to do the Deep Ring because we said,
[3:23:10.400 --> 3:23:12.560]  you know, we experienced all this stuff.
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:15.520]  After the election, we saw all these affidavits,
[3:23:15.520 --> 3:23:18.520]  1,000, I don't know, 3,000, 4,000 affidavits
[3:23:18.520 --> 3:23:21.800]  in six or seven states across the United States.
[3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:24.880]  All this evidence coming forward, the court's punted.
[3:23:24.880 --> 3:23:27.720]  You know, there's no standing here.
[3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:30.280]  And we decided, you know, we need
[3:23:30.280 --> 3:23:33.080]  to memorialize this in a movie, in a documentary.
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:35.440]  So Patrick and I actually thought about it.
[3:23:35.440 --> 3:23:37.640]  God bless Patrick for helping finance it.
[3:23:37.640 --> 3:23:39.360]  And we created the Deep Ring, which
[3:23:39.360 --> 3:23:42.280]  talked specifically about the book that he wrote,
[3:23:42.280 --> 3:23:45.320]  where there was fraud, probably everywhere,
[3:23:45.320 --> 3:23:48.520]  but there was fraud perpetrated in six particular counties
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:50.840]  in those swing states, where they
[3:23:50.840 --> 3:23:53.840]  knew they could win Arizona by 10,000 votes,
[3:23:53.840 --> 3:23:57.520]  win Georgia by whatever it was, 18,000, 14,000.
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:23:59.640]  Those are, especially with all these mail-in ballots,
[3:23:59.640 --> 3:24:02.520]  that there was a concerted effort there.
[3:24:02.520 --> 3:24:06.080]  And listen, we have every right in the world, in this country,
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:08.880]  to say, we don't believe the election was valid.
[3:24:08.880 --> 3:24:10.320]  It's not a crime to say that.
[3:24:10.320 --> 3:24:12.000]  And we want to look into it, simply.
[3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:14.040]  And we want to look into it, exactly.
[3:24:14.040 --> 3:24:16.280]  You know what Mark Zuckerberg's doing?
[3:24:16.280 --> 3:24:17.800]  It came out more than five years ago
[3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:19.200]  in his own company documents.
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:21.840]  But whistleblowers warned the world
[3:24:21.840 --> 3:24:25.560]  that he was trying to isolate people to be only on Facebook
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:29.760]  and to be depressed and alone, so that avatars or fake computer
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:32.000]  identities would be their only friends,
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:35.240]  thus taking full control of the user's mind.
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:38.280]  That's just a beta test for what's now rolling out
[3:24:38.280 --> 3:24:42.040]  with Facebook, claiming ownership of the metaverse
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:44.960]  and buying up hundreds of VR companies,
[3:24:44.960 --> 3:24:47.920]  and now trying to force its users and employees
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:51.560]  to solely live in a fantasy world controlled
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:54.480]  and orchestrated by Zuckerberg and the organizations
[3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:55.680]  that he works with.
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:59.600]  This priest class wants to lock us in our five senses
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:01.080]  here in the third dimension.
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:04.360]  And to do that, they're creating an artificial, electronic
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:10.200]  prison or matrix to seduce us into giving up control
[3:25:10.200 --> 3:25:12.200]  of our bodies and our minds.
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:15.040]  This is the greatest deception ever.
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:18.960]  Evil is digging in because it knows humanity is waking up
[3:25:18.960 --> 3:25:20.960]  and that group consciousness is forming,
[3:25:20.960 --> 3:25:24.920]  and that we are beginning to transcend the third dimension.
[3:25:24.920 --> 3:25:26.760]  Everything that's being launched against us
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:30.280]  is an attempt to hold us in the third dimension
[3:25:30.280 --> 3:25:34.000]  and not just enslave us, but finally completely destroy us
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:37.920]  and absorb our energy into this system they're building.
[3:25:37.920 --> 3:25:40.400]  This is beyond the Satanic ritual.
[3:25:40.400 --> 3:25:43.200]  This is beyond anything you've read about in science fiction
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:47.000]  because this is actually happening in the real world today.
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:49.040]  And we have discovered their secrets.
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:50.800]  We've discovered how to stop them.
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:53.880]  And we have put it all together in an easy to understand
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:25:57.040]  system that gives you the tools to not just defeat
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:00.360]  the globalists, but to transcend to the next level.
[3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:03.520]  It's so important for all of you that already know this
[3:26:03.520 --> 3:26:06.560]  and have already witnessed this for yourself to understand.
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:08.920]  You are the leaders of the future that
[3:26:08.920 --> 3:26:12.400]  must go to the next level so that you and I and others
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:15.160]  working together can free the rest of humanity
[3:26:15.160 --> 3:26:18.320]  before they get trapped in this artificial matrix system
[3:26:18.320 --> 3:26:19.360]  the globalists are building.
[3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:20.720]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[3:26:20.720 --> 3:26:23.360]  The film The Matrix made in 1999 is not original.
[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:27.640]  Documents came out in 1990 from the late 1970s
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:31.440]  where NASA and DARPA were developing a plan very similar
[3:26:31.440 --> 3:26:32.560]  to The Matrix.
[3:26:32.560 --> 3:26:34.840]  And all that information is now public.
[3:26:34.840 --> 3:26:38.880]  They're attempting to seduce us to give up our five senses,
[3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:40.760]  not just holding us in the third dimension,
[3:26:40.760 --> 3:26:43.800]  but actually creating an artificial slave system
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:47.680]  so that they can turn us into their programmable slaves.
[3:26:47.680 --> 3:26:49.280]  Humanity are not robots.
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:51.640]  No matter how many times Ray Kurzweil and the social
[3:26:51.640 --> 3:26:53.840]  engineers tell us this, but they are trying
[3:26:53.840 --> 3:26:56.240]  to turn us into robots.
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:26:58.760]  That's why in December of 2021, we
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:00.560]  are launching reset boards.
[3:27:00.560 --> 3:27:03.560]  Find out more information at resetwars.com.
[3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:18.080]  General Flynn and I stood with the president on December 18
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:22.760]  saying what we want is to just open the ballot boxes
[3:27:22.760 --> 3:27:24.040]  in six places.
[3:27:24.040 --> 3:27:25.240]  Six places.
[3:27:25.240 --> 3:27:27.440]  You know, we've got 3,006 counties in America.
[3:27:27.440 --> 3:27:29.080]  Let's just look six places.
[3:27:29.080 --> 3:27:31.000]  Count them on live stream TV.
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:32.600]  Well, through a bunch of fighting,
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:34.280]  we finally got to open.
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:36.720]  And I didn't know that was such a crime against humanity,
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:38.280]  to want to open a ballot box and look.
[3:27:38.280 --> 3:27:40.320]  I thought that it happened all the time.
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:42.560]  For some reason, when we wanted to do it this time,
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:44.200]  they treated it like it's a war crime.
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:46.360]  But when they want to look at audit elections,
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:47.640]  they could go, you know.
[3:27:47.640 --> 3:27:49.320]  Anyway, so we open it and look at the,
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:51.320]  we finally got one of them opened.
[3:27:51.320 --> 3:27:52.720]  That was Maricopa.
[3:27:52.720 --> 3:27:53.560]  And what do you know?
[3:27:53.560 --> 3:27:55.720]  Maricopa County, Arizona.
[3:27:55.720 --> 3:27:58.400]  Yeah, it took six months to get them to open it.
[3:27:58.400 --> 3:28:00.040]  And we, and we get it open.
[3:28:00.040 --> 3:28:00.880]  And what do you know?
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:03.160]  The night before they finally get their arms twisted
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:04.400]  and have to deliver,
[3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:06.480]  they delete a million election files.
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:08.200]  Nothing else ticks or ties.
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:09.520]  There's 284,000.
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:10.600]  That was my next question.
[3:28:10.600 --> 3:28:12.000]  All the evidence to count on Maricopa,
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:13.600]  that proved that Trump won.
[3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:14.680]  And now you don't hear anything about it.
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:15.840]  Yeah, it's like this.
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:19.520]  It's, well, I've never seen such a clear suppression
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:21.720]  of the truth in the US is what they did on that.
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:24.400]  Because what that audit really shows is if,
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:27.520]  if you, you know, there's 284,000 ballots
[3:28:27.520 --> 3:28:30.680]  they made up here and 253,000 that just appear here
[3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:34.600]  and 57,000 illegal and 34,000 photocopies.
[3:28:34.600 --> 3:28:37.560]  But if you count all of them, Biden wins by 10,000,
[3:28:37.560 --> 3:28:39.760]  which the press portrayed as, you see,
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:42.200]  the audit showed Biden won by 10,000.
[3:28:42.200 --> 3:28:43.560]  Well, that only worked for a little bit.
[3:28:43.560 --> 3:28:45.200]  That was the stupidest reaction.
[3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:46.040]  You know, it's-
[3:28:46.040 --> 3:28:46.880]  Talk about gaslighting.
[3:28:46.880 --> 3:28:47.880]  Oh my God.
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:50.920]  Yeah, so now that's the attorney general there has it.
[3:28:50.920 --> 3:28:52.600]  Other states are piling on word,
[3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:54.600]  it'll have to pile on by other states.
[3:28:54.600 --> 3:28:59.240]  Today, anyone who is awake can clearly see
[3:28:59.240 --> 3:29:01.880]  why Alex Jones was de-platformed.
[3:29:01.880 --> 3:29:04.480]  Infowars was right above the target
[3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:06.480]  and the globalists were a year out
[3:29:06.480 --> 3:29:08.200]  from launching their attack.
[3:29:08.200 --> 3:29:11.440]  Three years later, an Infowars is still thriving
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:13.880]  thanks to the support of our audience.
[3:29:13.880 --> 3:29:16.960]  But we are now facing the fiercest battle yet.
[3:29:16.960 --> 3:29:20.160]  And we need you to help save Infowars.
[3:29:20.160 --> 3:29:22.440]  The enemies entrenched within our government
[3:29:22.440 --> 3:29:25.040]  are breaking the justice system more than ever
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:27.480]  in their attack against Alex Jones.
[3:29:27.480 --> 3:29:31.800]  No crime, no evidence, no jury, no trial,
[3:29:31.800 --> 3:29:33.080]  we don't think so.
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:35.520]  They wanna kill the messenger in a kangaroo trial
[3:29:35.520 --> 3:29:39.120]  with their new USA, but we won't let them.
[3:29:39.120 --> 3:29:41.880]  Alex Jones will have his day in court.

[3:29:59.200 --> 3:30:01.320]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[3:30:01.320 --> 3:30:02.600]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[3:30:02.600 --> 3:30:03.440]  Good, bro.
[3:30:03.440 --> 3:30:04.280]  It's a great last caller.
[3:30:04.280 --> 3:30:07.400]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:09.960]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore
[3:30:09.960 --> 3:30:13.160]  with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:15.040]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[3:30:15.040 --> 3:30:16.760]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[3:30:16.760 --> 3:30:18.160]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[3:30:18.160 --> 3:30:19.640]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:30:19.640 --> 3:30:21.440]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[3:30:21.440 --> 3:30:22.680]  for one of the products.
[3:30:22.680 --> 3:30:24.320]  The XQ does wonders.
[3:30:24.320 --> 3:30:25.560]  They recommend it to everybody.
[3:30:25.560 --> 3:30:26.640]  You're on the fence about it.
[3:30:26.640 --> 3:30:29.520]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the import.
[3:30:29.520 --> 3:30:31.400]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[3:30:31.400 --> 3:30:32.440]  Thanks for rolling, go ahead.
[3:30:32.440 --> 3:30:34.840]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you, it's an honor.
[3:30:34.840 --> 3:30:35.680]  Honor, talk to you.
[3:30:35.680 --> 3:30:36.760]  Awesome.
[3:30:36.760 --> 3:30:40.360]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products.
[3:30:40.360 --> 3:30:43.880]  Alpha Power, even at 29, if you ask my better half,
[3:30:43.880 --> 3:30:46.280]  she loves it, and it helps in the bedroom.
[3:30:46.280 --> 3:30:48.200]  So, just number one for a few of us there.
[3:30:48.200 --> 3:30:50.520]  That only works, it's not a joke, yeah.
[3:30:50.520 --> 3:30:51.360]  Absolutely.
[3:30:58.000 --> 3:30:59.640]  This is a great sponsor.
[3:30:59.640 --> 3:31:01.800]  We have one of the best deals you're gonna find out there
[3:31:01.800 --> 3:31:05.080]  on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.
[3:31:05.080 --> 3:31:06.920]  So, you can't be tracked, you can't be traced,
[3:31:06.920 --> 3:31:08.880]  and it'll work anywhere in the world
[3:31:08.880 --> 3:31:09.880]  where you can see the sky.

[3:31:11.360 --> 3:31:12.840]  and things for your car and your house
[3:31:12.840 --> 3:31:16.000]  that also are on the site, infowarsphone.com.

[3:31:17.520 --> 3:31:19.680]  They supply the board for everybody with their systems
[3:31:19.680 --> 3:31:21.320]  as well, they're amazing folks,
[3:31:21.320 --> 3:31:24.480]  and you get a free phone, a $600 to $50 value,

[3:31:28.520 --> 3:31:30.720]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[3:31:30.720 --> 3:31:33.200]  These aren't, and the calls are free when folks call you.
[3:31:33.200 --> 3:31:36.600]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes,
[3:31:36.600 --> 3:31:39.120]  150 minutes, so the calls you were free
[3:31:39.120 --> 3:31:40.320]  works like a regular cell phone.
[3:31:40.320 --> 3:31:41.560]  You're not being tracked or traced,
[3:31:41.560 --> 3:31:42.840]  and I keep one on my car.
[3:31:42.840 --> 3:31:44.680]  I've given it to my parents as gifts,
[3:31:44.680 --> 3:31:45.520]  way out the middle of nowhere
[3:31:45.520 --> 3:31:47.080]  where regular phones don't work, they work.

[3:32:54.400 --> 3:33:01.400]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[3:33:13.440 --> 3:33:15.400]  it's Owen Troyer.
[3:33:15.400 --> 3:33:18.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:19.640 --> 3:33:23.480]  And let's go back to Alex with Mike Flynn,
[3:33:23.480 --> 3:33:28.080]  Patrick Byrne, and more on a excellent roundtable discussion.
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:29.400]  I think it's hard to strike back, though,
[3:33:29.400 --> 3:33:31.480]  with all this election fraud coming out,
[3:33:31.480 --> 3:33:33.240]  the corrupt forces aren't going to just lay on their back.
[3:33:33.240 --> 3:33:35.160]  Like you said, they're going to try to stop us
[3:33:35.160 --> 3:33:36.440]  from having a real election out of here.
[3:33:36.440 --> 3:33:40.440]  Right, and I think that they're going to continue to focus
[3:33:40.440 --> 3:33:42.360]  on how do they maintain control
[3:33:42.360 --> 3:33:43.840]  or how do they get better control?
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:47.200]  So I believe that we're going to see a couple of things.
[3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:49.120]  I think we're going to see,
[3:33:49.120 --> 3:33:51.560]  and I call it a controlled depression,
[3:33:51.560 --> 3:33:57.800]  with some type of financial manipulation
[3:33:57.800 --> 3:34:00.680]  or a financial collapse.
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:01.840]  And I don't want...
[3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:04.560]  Yeah, so that's a separate thing.
[3:34:04.560 --> 3:34:06.160]  So we're going to have, I think,
[3:34:06.160 --> 3:34:08.280]  some type of controlled depression.
[3:34:08.280 --> 3:34:10.360]  I mean, we're already at 6% inflation.
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:11.760]  For us to go to 10%,
[3:34:11.760 --> 3:34:13.280]  I don't think these people have any problems.
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:14.240]  We're going to get there.
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:15.360]  So that's number one.
[3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:18.280]  I think number two, we're going to see an uptick
[3:34:18.280 --> 3:34:22.840]  in other aspects of the COVID.
[3:34:22.840 --> 3:34:24.960]  Okay, so we got the various variants.
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:27.760]  There might even be another form of a SARS
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:31.480]  that's imposed on the international system, right?
[3:34:31.480 --> 3:34:32.400]  You know, the international system,
[3:34:32.400 --> 3:34:35.480]  because their little plan with COVID didn't work
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:37.160]  because too many people, you know,
[3:34:37.160 --> 3:34:40.120]  the world of what I call the digital warriors
[3:34:40.120 --> 3:34:43.840]  or the citizen journalists that are out there,
[3:34:43.840 --> 3:34:45.680]  they are fighting for the truth.
[3:34:45.680 --> 3:34:47.320]  And so the truth has been exposed
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:49.800]  about all the COVID tyranny that we are facing.
[3:34:49.800 --> 3:34:51.680]  So I think what we're going to see is potentially
[3:34:51.680 --> 3:34:55.080]  another type of virus that's imposed on the public.
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:57.280]  And I hope that that's not the case,
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:34:58.920]  but I've seen some indications of that
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:00.160]  and some of the statements
[3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:03.160]  by some of these global elite type of people.
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:05.680]  The third thing, I do think that, you know,
[3:35:05.680 --> 3:35:07.600]  you mentioned sort of a cyber thing.
[3:35:07.600 --> 3:35:10.920]  I actually think it could be a very targeted type
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:15.560]  of a shutdown, like last summer, last August,
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:18.800]  I saw, this past August, I saw where the government
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:21.520]  did a test of the emergency broadcast system.
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:24.120]  And we may have shared some,
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:25.760]  you may have talked about that.
[3:35:25.760 --> 3:35:28.200]  It was in early August and it ran for a couple of days,
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:29.960]  but they did one specific day.
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:30.800]  The government will say,
[3:35:30.800 --> 3:35:32.960]  oh, we do that all the time, it's routine.
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:34.920]  But this particular one was a little different.
[3:35:34.920 --> 3:35:35.960]  It was a little bit longer,
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:38.360]  it was done in very specific locations.
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:39.400]  And that got my attention
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:41.680]  because the emergency broadcast system in this country
[3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:44.920]  is where they could shut everything down, everything.
[3:35:44.920 --> 3:35:46.480]  And now the government is gonna tell you
[3:35:46.480 --> 3:35:47.920]  what you need to know.
[3:35:47.920 --> 3:35:52.080]  And they do that for, you know, a nuclear strike, right?
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:53.320]  If we're gonna have a nuclear strike
[3:35:53.320 --> 3:35:55.640]  or if we're under some sort of military threat.
[3:35:55.640 --> 3:35:56.680]  They're gonna track some of the internet.
[3:35:56.680 --> 3:35:58.440]  Yeah, oh no, they can take the entire thing.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:01.240]  I mean, the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission,
[3:36:01.240 --> 3:36:02.840]  works for the federal government.
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:03.680]  And the FCC-
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:04.880]  They can take you all to one website.
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:06.760]  Everything, I mean, everything, you'll have not.
[3:36:06.760 --> 3:36:08.680]  That's why Ham radio operators of old
[3:36:08.680 --> 3:36:10.600]  used to be the ones that could defeat
[3:36:10.600 --> 3:36:13.080]  any kind of communications shutdown.
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:17.160]  So I do think that we could potentially experience that.
[3:36:17.160 --> 3:36:18.840]  These are the worst case scenarios.
[3:36:18.840 --> 3:36:22.200]  So as a guy who has served at multiple levels
[3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:24.640]  of intelligence and has faced our enemies
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:26.240]  and has studied our enemies,
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:27.960]  one of the things that we always have to look at
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:32.320]  and consider is what are the worst case scenarios
[3:36:32.320 --> 3:36:33.520]  that we could face?
[3:36:33.520 --> 3:36:34.640]  And those are just a couple.
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:35.760]  There's probably some others,
[3:36:35.760 --> 3:36:38.600]  but this point about this controlled depression
[3:36:38.600 --> 3:36:39.760]  I'm really concerned about
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:42.000]  because we are moving in that direction right now.
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:46.720]  And as Patrick predicted, I think in like 2008 maybe,
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:48.400]  I may have my wrong numbers wrong,
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:51.320]  but about an economic collapse of the system.
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:53.920]  Well, now they're in charge of a lot of things,
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:57.800]  media, the tech titans, the executive branch of government,
[3:36:57.800 --> 3:37:00.080]  the legislative branch of government of the US government,
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:03.120]  and they have the globalists that are basically
[3:37:03.120 --> 3:37:04.720]  they're working very closely with.
[3:37:04.720 --> 3:37:07.160]  So now they control a lot of things.
[3:37:07.160 --> 3:37:10.520]  And those things out, if we say it's a controlled depression,
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:12.080]  what the hell does that mean, Flynn?
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:15.800]  That means that they're gonna take the us's of the world,
[3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:18.200]  people like, you know, the have nots
[3:37:18.200 --> 3:37:19.840]  and they're gonna crush the have nots
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:22.840]  to a point where we further divide this country
[3:37:22.840 --> 3:37:24.080]  and take it over at the federal level.
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:25.160]  Let me back up what you're saying
[3:37:25.160 --> 3:37:26.320]  and I know Patrick's an expert on this
[3:37:26.320 --> 3:37:27.280]  and I want both to take on this.
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:28.640]  This is the most important issue.
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:30.080]  It's actually on my list.
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:32.160]  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I do notice patterns.
[3:37:32.160 --> 3:37:33.480]  And I've noticed the Davos groups,
[3:37:33.480 --> 3:37:35.200]  former head of the Bilderberg group runs it.
[3:37:35.200 --> 3:37:36.960]  Give me, obviously they're the top of the corporate food
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:40.760]  chain run the UN and they represent the Fortune 500.
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:44.320]  They openly brag that they're gonna use cyber attacks
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:46.200]  to bring in their reset,
[3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:48.160]  that they're gonna use a collapse in the world economy
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:51.000]  to bring in this new global currency,
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:52.880]  universal basic income.
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:54.480]  They've now announced as of a month ago
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:56.520]  that they're officially with the UN.
[3:37:56.520 --> 3:37:59.800]  They have the world ID now through the vaccine passport
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:02.320]  that also ties to a carbon tax passport
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:03.520]  and a social credits course.
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:05.400]  So they've got this thing all set up
[3:38:05.400 --> 3:38:07.040]  and then they foreshadowed, as you know,
[3:38:07.040 --> 3:38:09.280]  in some of their drills, operation lockstep
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:12.760]  and then SPARS 2023 that you talked about.
[3:38:12.760 --> 3:38:14.800]  They war game all of this
[3:38:14.800 --> 3:38:16.240]  so they have a way to have the battle plans
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:18.360]  but everybody finds that they go, oh, that's just a drill
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:20.440]  but really it's the battle plan, as you know,
[3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:21.920]  and maybe explain this to people.
[3:38:21.920 --> 3:38:24.040]  And now they're battle planning and Schwab has said
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:26.200]  the next thing will be a giant cyber attack.
[3:38:26.200 --> 3:38:28.360]  They're gonna save us by taking over
[3:38:28.360 --> 3:38:30.960]  but the cyber attack may take down the old currency.
[3:38:30.960 --> 3:38:32.760]  So they're already foreshadowing this.
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:34.160]  Can you speak to why they do that
[3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:37.560]  and what you're saying is Schwab has said,
[3:38:37.560 --> 3:38:39.640]  we're creating an angrier planet
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:41.880]  by creating a depression on purpose
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:44.720]  to then bring in basically globalist control.
[3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:51.320]  Yeah, there is gonna be a financial crash.
[3:38:51.800 --> 3:38:53.920]  The question is, do we emerge from the rubble
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:58.920]  as the U.S.S.A., the United Socialist States of America
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:02.800]  or maybe we emerge as the U.S.A. stripped of
[3:39:02.800 --> 3:39:05.040]  the bad eye, the stuff that's really been going on
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:06.400]  since FDR that got us here.
[3:39:06.400 --> 3:39:09.120]  They punched some holes in the Constitution under FDR
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:12.360]  where they threatened to pack the court
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:14.440]  and the result has been a federal government
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:16.160]  that got three times the size it should have
[3:39:16.160 --> 3:39:19.800]  and we're reaching the end of that play.
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:22.280]  So the question is, are we going to emerge?
[3:39:22.280 --> 3:39:23.480]  I've always wondered all my life
[3:39:23.480 --> 3:39:25.040]  how my father was an actuary
[3:39:25.040 --> 3:39:28.240]  and that's the mathematician's under insurance.
[3:39:28.240 --> 3:39:30.040]  So it kind of taught me this idea
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:32.400]  of something being actuarially sound.
[3:39:32.400 --> 3:39:34.360]  So all my life I've looked at these programs
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:37.280]  and thought, how could the left not see
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:41.440]  that they're advocating things on an unsustainable basis?
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:44.040]  There's no, this is all gonna crack eventually.
[3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:44.960]  And what are they thinking?
[3:39:44.960 --> 3:39:47.280]  Now I understand, I finally understand.
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:48.360]  They wanted it to crack.
[3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:51.160]  The plan was, we're gonna run it until it crashes
[3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:53.680]  and then we're gonna merge and control out of the rubble.
[3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:55.440]  So our mission is to stop that
[3:39:55.440 --> 3:39:58.440]  and I'm actually quite optimistic because,
[3:39:58.440 --> 3:40:00.480]  well, when we get back to election fraud,
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:02.480]  I'll tell you why because I think we're gonna get
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:03.800]  some big changes soon.
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:07.240]  I'm actually, I think, as opposed to my brother here,
[3:40:07.240 --> 3:40:09.560]  I'm not as, I am also optimistic like you.
[3:40:09.560 --> 3:40:12.280]  And the reason what makes me optimistic is the asset
[3:40:12.280 --> 3:40:14.560]  that we have, which is the American people.
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:18.040]  I think the American people are truly, truly waking up.
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:20.800]  I think actually the far left, the far left,
[3:40:20.800 --> 3:40:24.520]  communists, people who wanna go communists in numbers
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:27.160]  is a smaller number, way smaller number
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:29.040]  than maybe the mainstream media
[3:40:29.040 --> 3:40:30.320]  or people feel is out there.
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:33.200]  I actually think 70, 80% of this country
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:35.040]  does not wanna go in that direction.
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:39.680]  And I think the left has very much overplayed their hand.
[3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:42.200]  Now, will they continue to try to stuff things
[3:40:42.200 --> 3:40:44.320]  down our throat and do things, try to crush us?
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:46.280]  They may, they may very well do.
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:49.920]  But my opinion is, if my personal opinion is
[3:40:49.920 --> 3:40:52.880]  if we get through this winter, we get through this winter
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:55.840]  and we get moving towards the summer
[3:40:55.840 --> 3:40:57.560]  where we're gaining more momentum
[3:40:57.560 --> 3:41:00.840]  with in the exposure in Maricopa and other cities,
[3:41:00.840 --> 3:41:02.440]  in other states, by the way,
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:05.600]  and more economic malaise comes in,
[3:41:05.600 --> 3:41:07.640]  I think that these, they're gonna know
[3:41:07.640 --> 3:41:08.560]  that their goose is cooked.
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:09.400]  Exactly.
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:11.360]  What they do when their goose is cooked is what I fear
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:12.400]  and I think is what you fear.
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:14.360]  Exactly, they want it to have clowered and pivot
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:15.800]  and then pose as the sabers.
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:17.320]  But if we all know they did on purpose,
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:18.760]  it destroys them on America.
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:19.760]  Yeah.
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:20.600]  Go ahead, Pat.
[3:41:20.600 --> 3:41:23.000]  Well, and I think that something key
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:25.120]  has just happened yesterday and today.
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:27.000]  Mike is right, their imposition of tyranny
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:28.800]  is coming through medical tyranny.
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:32.080]  But we have through an open source law fair movement.
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:34.920]  And do you know Tori, by the way, the podcast for Tori?
[3:41:34.920 --> 3:41:37.480]  Anyway, there's this woman out there with this big podcast
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:40.080]  that has created an open source law fair movement.
[3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:43.480]  Got 50 Supreme Court state Supreme Court cases
[3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:47.040]  filed against VAX mandates and mask mandates.
[3:41:47.040 --> 3:41:49.960]  Some federal cases, some, you know, Simone Gold
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:53.000]  from America Frontline Doctors, other cases.
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:56.080]  Those are actually just in the last week,
[3:41:56.080 --> 3:41:58.120]  they're getting, they're winning.
[3:41:58.120 --> 3:42:00.480]  And the Fifth Circuit has now,
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:02.400]  the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:03.240]  Yes, Mike.
[3:42:03.240 --> 3:42:05.000]  Great, read the filing, post that online
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:07.560]  because the judge is masterful in his filing.
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:08.400]  And he supported the decision.
[3:42:08.400 --> 3:42:10.920]  And he supported that he granted a week or 10 days ago.
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:12.760]  He supported it with a blistering decision.
[3:42:12.760 --> 3:42:14.760]  The decision spanks.
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:17.360]  I actually felt a little bad for the other guys.
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:19.160]  It spanks them so badly
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:21.800]  for outrageous constitutional overreach.
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:24.240]  Well, the signal that that federal decision sends
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:27.000]  across all the DOD and everywhere else means,
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:30.960]  we've broken their momentum on that battle.
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:32.080]  That's a big win.
[3:42:32.080 --> 3:42:33.440]  Yeah, read that.
[3:42:33.440 --> 3:42:37.360]  I mean, and post that decision because the judge,
[3:42:37.360 --> 3:42:41.840]  and I actually, when I get some time here in the next 24 hours,
[3:42:41.840 --> 3:42:43.600]  I'm gonna go look at who that judge is
[3:42:43.600 --> 3:42:47.880]  because to me, that's a judge that is actually
[3:42:47.880 --> 3:42:54.880]  using the Constitution the way it was designed to be used.

[3:43:53.640 --> 3:43:54.960]  infowarstore.com.
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:43:59.680]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough
[3:43:59.680 --> 3:44:02.880]  in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[3:44:02.880 --> 3:44:05.080]  We have found an extraordinary new,
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:08.240]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[3:44:08.240 --> 3:44:12.080]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:15.120]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:18.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed
[3:44:18.400 --> 3:44:21.720]  that people who ate certain quail eggs
[3:44:21.720 --> 3:44:26.360]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:44:26.360 --> 3:44:29.200]  They began studying this effect in published trials
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:32.400]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:34.720]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[3:44:34.720 --> 3:44:37.520]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[3:44:37.520 --> 3:44:40.160]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:41.920]  It is not an antihistamine.
[3:44:41.920 --> 3:44:43.640]  In fact, current research has found
[3:44:43.640 --> 3:44:47.040]  that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[3:44:47.040 --> 3:44:49.400]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[3:44:49.400 --> 3:44:51.640]  and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:44:51.640 --> 3:44:54.320]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:44:56.360]  Head to infowarslife.com
[3:44:56.360 --> 3:44:59.400]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:44:59.400 --> 3:45:03.520]  There are so many crappy brands of energy products,
[3:45:03.520 --> 3:45:06.640]  energy drinks, energy powders, energy pills.
[3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:09.320]  And look, almost all of them work,
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:12.520]  but they're toxic and they've got incredible downsides.
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:17.520]  Horrible crashes and, again, so many toxins in them.
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:20.800]  All of the Neutropic products that we sell
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:25.480]  at infowarslife.com are clean, are pure, are highest quality
[3:45:25.480 --> 3:45:29.880]  and they're long-lasting and they help focus your mind.
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:31.920]  And right now, our strongest product
[3:45:31.920 --> 3:45:33.880]  of the three Neutrobics we have,
[3:45:33.880 --> 3:45:36.720]  Rainforce Plus, Rainforce Ultra,
[3:45:36.720 --> 3:45:41.720]  and TurboForce are back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[3:45:43.120 --> 3:45:46.560]  TurboForce has been sold out for more than six months.
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:49.400]  It's back in stock with free shipping, 40% off.
[3:45:49.400 --> 3:45:54.400]  It is 10 hours of clean energy,
[3:45:54.400 --> 3:45:56.720]  clean energy without the big crash,
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:45:57.760]  and it's available right now
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:00.240]  and it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:05.240]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience,
[3:46:05.240 --> 3:46:09.880]  a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains
[3:46:09.880 --> 3:46:11.600]  that the medical tyranny combined,
[3:46:11.600 --> 3:46:13.960]  controlled by the global private corporations,
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:15.480]  has put in place.
[3:46:15.480 --> 3:46:19.240]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:21.320]  from which we will never emerge.
[3:46:21.320 --> 3:46:24.240]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:26.880]  and must cover our diseased criminal faces
[3:46:26.880 --> 3:46:29.480]  from the light of the sun.
[3:46:29.480 --> 3:46:33.760]  It is the symbol of our complete and total,
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:37.120]  absolute surrender to evil.
[3:46:37.120 --> 3:46:41.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[3:46:41.720 --> 3:46:44.960]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[3:46:44.960 --> 3:46:46.840]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out
[3:46:46.840 --> 3:46:48.360]  with implantable microchips
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:51.320]  as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[3:46:51.320 --> 3:46:53.600]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[3:46:53.600 --> 3:46:56.920]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[3:46:56.920 --> 3:47:03.920]  Thank you.
[3:47:13.080 --> 3:47:15.320]  All right, final segment of the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:18.320]  We're gonna go back to this powerful round table.
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:20.920]  And then I'll be back right after doing my normal
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:22.880]  war room coverage, taking your phone calls
[3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:25.560]  and a big guest coming on as well, Jimmy Levy.
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:31.720]  But first, we go back to this powerful round table.
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:32.320]  I totally agree.
[3:47:32.320 --> 3:47:35.560]  What about the big question for the US
[3:47:35.560 --> 3:47:37.720]  we'd ask about this kind of run for president?
[3:47:37.720 --> 3:47:38.640]  He's handed the microphone.
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:39.480]  Why don't we do that?
[3:47:39.480 --> 3:47:43.800]  Well, I can tell you that the, I know elements
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:46.760]  in the Republican Party who are already talking about
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:49.160]  if Trump doesn't run, it's a draft Flynn movement.
[3:47:49.160 --> 3:47:53.720]  There's a draft Flynn movement latent in the Republican Party
[3:47:53.720 --> 3:47:57.680]  just waiting for Donald Trump to make his decision.
[3:47:57.680 --> 3:48:01.640]  And I think that we could not find a better president.
[3:48:01.640 --> 3:48:04.960]  There's even a bigger bullet on my forehead.
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:06.600]  There's already one on my back.
[3:48:06.600 --> 3:48:08.440]  I'm not gonna say anything because I'm still his little brother.
[3:48:08.440 --> 3:48:11.040]  He can smack me upside my head while I'm sitting next to him.
[3:48:11.040 --> 3:48:13.840]  My dream job is gonna be to go work for Mike Flynn
[3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:15.440]  and his brother, the chief of staff.
[3:48:15.440 --> 3:48:20.720]  No, I think that the next 18 months
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:23.520]  is gonna be crucial to this country.
[3:48:23.520 --> 3:48:26.000]  And I think that your audience, which is a great audience
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:28.240]  and others out there, realize what's happened.
[3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:29.640]  And I think the people of the state of Virginia,
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:31.880]  we saw it in the state of Virginia, we saw it in New Jersey,
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:33.840]  we saw it in these local elections.
[3:48:33.840 --> 3:48:36.680]  This, they have overplayed there.
[3:48:36.680 --> 3:48:39.680]  And the question is, can we take it back from them
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:43.280]  before they do something very drastic, very authoritarian,
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:46.120]  or some type of black swan event that is created
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:48.760]  in order for an authoritarian move to take place?
[3:48:48.760 --> 3:48:51.680]  That's what my big concern is probably,
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:53.760]  you talk about this kind of stuff a lot.
[3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:55.840]  And unfortunately, those things can happen.
[3:48:55.840 --> 3:48:56.680]  They can be manufactured.
[3:48:56.680 --> 3:48:58.280]  That's why I think Tucker Carlson's documentary
[3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:00.440]  exposed in false fly aspects is important.
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:03.840]  Yeah, I mean, and I've said this in the last 24 hours,
[3:49:03.840 --> 3:49:05.840]  if people haven't watched those documentaries,
[3:49:05.840 --> 3:49:07.960]  that there's three of them, there's three parts
[3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:09.680]  that they need to look at and they need to watch them
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:11.280]  because I think he did a really good job
[3:49:11.280 --> 3:49:12.840]  of exposing exactly what it is,
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:15.880]  this assault on our liberties.
[3:49:15.880 --> 3:49:18.920]  You know, if the destiny of America
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:21.880]  is to continue to be a free country,
[3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:27.600]  and it's a journey, right?
[3:49:27.600 --> 3:49:32.600]  And journey as a word kind of intends that it is a long thing.
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:35.520]  Well, the destiny of America as a free country
[3:49:35.520 --> 3:49:38.640]  is on a fast track towards something else.
[3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:41.760]  If we do not stand up for this country
[3:49:41.760 --> 3:49:44.560]  and stand up for our rights, stand up for our freedoms
[3:49:44.560 --> 3:49:46.640]  and get involved in our communities,
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:50.320]  no more excuses, American people, no more excuses,
[3:49:50.320 --> 3:49:52.880]  no more finger pointing, no more saying,
[3:49:52.880 --> 3:49:54.640]  I don't do that political thing.
[3:49:54.640 --> 3:49:56.240]  People that are in business in this country,
[3:49:56.240 --> 3:49:57.480]  especially small businesses
[3:49:57.480 --> 3:50:00.280]  who have been able to sustain themselves,
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:03.520]  you know, these are the times now when you have to,
[3:50:03.520 --> 3:50:05.000]  you have to rise up and say,
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:06.640]  look, I'm not gonna put up with it anymore,
[3:50:06.640 --> 3:50:08.560]  I'm gonna get involved in my,
[3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:10.920]  as Patrick has been so adamant about,
[3:50:10.920 --> 3:50:14.160]  and all of us, get involved in the civic,
[3:50:14.160 --> 3:50:17.400]  your civic duty as an American citizen
[3:50:17.400 --> 3:50:22.200]  to protect not you, to protect it for the generations
[3:50:22.200 --> 3:50:23.200]  that are gonna follow us,
[3:50:23.200 --> 3:50:26.120]  because our founders did an amazing job,
[3:50:26.120 --> 3:50:27.760]  had an amazing vision,
[3:50:27.760 --> 3:50:30.000]  knowing that we would be at a point like this
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:32.680]  in the future, and they protected it
[3:50:32.680 --> 3:50:35.080]  for the better part of 240 years.
[3:50:35.080 --> 3:50:37.480]  So now it's our turn to protect it
[3:50:37.480 --> 3:50:39.320]  for maybe another 240 years.
[3:50:39.320 --> 3:50:41.200]  We're at a very historic moment.
[3:50:41.200 --> 3:50:46.200]  We are, we are, do you wanna talk about some good news
[3:50:46.560 --> 3:50:47.720]  and some reason for optimistic?
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:48.720]  Yeah, let's spend some time on that,
[3:50:48.720 --> 3:50:50.240]  and in general, I'm gonna bring your sandwich over,
[3:50:50.240 --> 3:50:51.360]  we'll just eat that on.
[3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:53.880]  You've been working really hard today.
[3:50:53.880 --> 3:50:56.080]  I wanna tell you, so we've had,
[3:50:56.080 --> 3:50:57.080]  the way we've think of it,
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:50:58.560]  so we formed the America Project,
[3:50:58.560 --> 3:51:01.400]  which is what we've talked about,
[3:51:01.400 --> 3:51:03.160]  and I'll be pitching that later,
[3:51:03.160 --> 3:51:06.000]  but there's a ground game,
[3:51:06.000 --> 3:51:09.280]  and the ground game is four yards in a cloud of dust
[3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:11.400]  between now and 51 weeks.
[3:51:11.400 --> 3:51:12.880]  We are less than a month,
[3:51:12.880 --> 3:51:14.520]  we're less than a year from the next election,
[3:51:14.520 --> 3:51:16.680]  absolutely no reason to go violent.
[3:51:16.680 --> 3:51:19.840]  In 51 weeks, we are building the nationwide system
[3:51:19.840 --> 3:51:21.600]  that can do what just happened in Virginia,
[3:51:21.600 --> 3:51:24.000]  and the truth is, Bishop Leon Benjamin,
[3:51:24.000 --> 3:51:26.200]  who was behind what happened in Virginia,
[3:51:26.200 --> 3:51:29.280]  this wonderful man who set up hundreds of volunteers
[3:51:29.280 --> 3:51:30.440]  who went into the precincts and-
[3:51:30.440 --> 3:51:31.280]  African American pastor.
[3:51:31.280 --> 3:51:33.040]  300 churches in Virginia.
[3:51:33.040 --> 3:51:34.600]  Got them all on board,
[3:51:34.600 --> 3:51:37.560]  they're the ones who brought integrity
[3:51:37.560 --> 3:51:38.520]  to the Virginia election,
[3:51:38.520 --> 3:51:40.480]  and that's why what happened in Virginia happened.
[3:51:40.480 --> 3:51:43.480]  And historical numbers of African Americans
[3:51:43.480 --> 3:51:46.640]  voting red for the first time in probably generations.
[3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:48.040]  And we funded that. Historical percentages.
[3:51:48.040 --> 3:51:50.600]  We funded that 100%, frankly,
[3:51:50.600 --> 3:51:53.240]  and we're prepared to do it in 49 other states.
[3:51:53.240 --> 3:51:54.080]  Great job.
[3:51:54.080 --> 3:51:57.320]  However, that's the four yard in a cloud of dust plan.
[3:51:57.320 --> 3:51:59.760]  There's a 30 yard pass right now this week
[3:51:59.760 --> 3:52:01.280]  for people to get involved with.
[3:52:01.280 --> 3:52:03.920]  The big lawsuit that Mike Lindell has promised
[3:52:03.920 --> 3:52:06.240]  is coming on November 23rd.
[3:52:06.240 --> 3:52:09.160]  This week, with the 26 federal,
[3:52:09.160 --> 3:52:10.960]  26 state attorney generals,
[3:52:10.960 --> 3:52:12.840]  Republican state attorney generals
[3:52:12.840 --> 3:52:13.800]  are being approached,
[3:52:13.800 --> 3:52:18.720]  being asked to participate in this lawsuit.
[3:52:18.720 --> 3:52:21.440]  We want the people of the 26 states
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:26.440]  to be peacefully, peacefully letting their attorneys general
[3:52:26.440 --> 3:52:29.480]  know that they really expected,
[3:52:29.480 --> 3:52:30.520]  they're expected to support,
[3:52:30.520 --> 3:52:32.400]  to study this case, and if appropriate,
[3:52:32.400 --> 3:52:34.240]  if they did, to study this case,
[3:52:34.240 --> 3:52:35.440]  considering, consider signing on.
[3:52:35.440 --> 3:52:36.800]  It's just like December,
[3:52:36.800 --> 3:52:40.000]  only that case was the result of three weeks of investigation.
[3:52:40.000 --> 3:52:44.440]  This case has far more work and all kinds of dimensions
[3:52:44.440 --> 3:52:46.520]  the public has had no idea about for this year
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:47.920]  are included in this case.
[3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:48.760]  And the good news is,
[3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:50.200]  national polls continue to show
[3:52:50.200 --> 3:52:53.320]  what 80% of Republicans and a 40% of Democrats
[3:52:53.320 --> 3:52:54.160]  think it was stolen.
[3:52:54.160 --> 3:52:55.000]  So we're winning the info.
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:55.840]  Yeah, the momentum is there.
[3:52:55.840 --> 3:52:56.680]  Yeah.
[3:52:56.680 --> 3:52:59.320]  60%, 60%, and by, we do a monthly poll,
[3:52:59.320 --> 3:53:02.560]  60% say significant or very significant fraud.
[3:53:02.560 --> 3:53:04.160]  Another 10% are unsure.
[3:53:04.160 --> 3:53:05.360]  So there's 70%.
[3:53:05.360 --> 3:53:07.720]  So only 30% of Americans think Biden,
[3:53:07.720 --> 3:53:09.640]  actually 28%, we'll say Biden won.
[3:53:09.640 --> 3:53:10.640]  There's a reason why it's poll number.
[3:53:10.640 --> 3:53:13.360]  I mean, other than the disastrous job that he's doing,
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:16.240]  poll numbers, which are 38%, there's a reason for that.
[3:53:16.240 --> 3:53:18.960]  The moderates, the people didn't vote for Trump
[3:53:18.960 --> 3:53:20.840]  because they hated Trump for only one reason.
[3:53:20.840 --> 3:53:22.280]  They didn't like the man.
[3:53:22.280 --> 3:53:25.800]  So they know now that they made a massive mistake.
[3:53:25.800 --> 3:53:27.480]  They know now that, you know,
[3:53:27.480 --> 3:53:29.680]  they left the country in the hands of these people
[3:53:29.680 --> 3:53:33.720]  that are, they cannot be this incompetent, Alex.
[3:53:33.720 --> 3:53:36.760]  You think that, I mean, it has to be,
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:39.400]  it has to be, parts of it have to be planned.
[3:53:39.400 --> 3:53:40.440]  What they're doing at the border,
[3:53:40.440 --> 3:53:41.920]  that's not incompetence.
[3:53:41.920 --> 3:53:43.120]  Oh, the U.N. is organizing it.
[3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:43.960]  Yeah.
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:44.800]  And then Biden works for him, man.
[3:53:44.800 --> 3:53:45.640]  It's all, it's all a U.N.
[3:53:45.640 --> 3:53:46.640]  That's not, it can't be incompetence.
[3:53:46.640 --> 3:53:47.960]  And that's, that's what's the sad part of it.
[3:53:47.960 --> 3:53:49.600]  Part of the left is our southern border deliberately.
[3:53:49.600 --> 3:53:50.440]  Yeah.
[3:53:50.440 --> 3:53:51.880]  And they're blocking people from trying to.
[3:53:51.880 --> 3:53:53.880]  Well, let's say this in closing.
[3:53:53.880 --> 3:53:55.600]  Listers need to understand that are watching this.
[3:53:55.600 --> 3:53:58.000]  You are the vanguards, what the general's been saying.
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:01.680]  It's what we've all been saying here over and over again.
[3:54:01.680 --> 3:54:05.560]  And so take this video and take their speeches
[3:54:05.560 --> 3:54:07.920]  from this event and others and share it with everyone you know
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:08.920]  and tell them to share it.
[3:54:08.920 --> 3:54:09.960]  That's the Chan reaction.
[3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:13.440]  So let's all talk about where folks find our forbidden
[3:54:13.440 --> 3:54:15.200]  pro-America, pro-freedom information.
[3:54:15.200 --> 3:54:19.000]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video.
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:20.520]  And then talk about the initiatives,
[3:54:20.520 --> 3:54:21.680]  what you guys are doing.
[3:54:21.680 --> 3:54:23.800]  So I'm gonna give the plug to everybody
[3:54:23.800 --> 3:54:26.080]  to visit theamericaproject.com.
[3:54:26.080 --> 3:54:29.080]  That's an organization that General Flynn's advises us
[3:54:29.080 --> 3:54:30.600]  on, but Patrick and I are on the board of
[3:54:30.600 --> 3:54:31.920]  founding members of.
[3:54:31.920 --> 3:54:33.080]  People have to get behind it now.
[3:54:33.080 --> 3:54:33.920]  Tell them again.
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:35.920]  You have to get behind the America Project now.
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:39.080]  It's www.theamericaproject.com.
[3:54:39.080 --> 3:54:40.760]  Go on the site, become a member.
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:41.720]  It's free of charge.
[3:54:41.720 --> 3:54:42.800]  Get involved with us.
[3:54:42.800 --> 3:54:43.800]  Get connected.
[3:54:43.800 --> 3:54:45.440]  It's the network of networks.
[3:54:45.440 --> 3:54:48.440]  We are the guys who know everything from all the
[3:54:48.440 --> 3:54:50.640]  different networks of doctors who are fighting medical
[3:54:50.640 --> 3:54:53.800]  tyranny, lawyers, you know, Latinas for America.
[3:54:53.800 --> 3:54:55.800]  Grassroots organizations across the country.
[3:54:55.800 --> 3:54:56.800]  Moms for America.
[3:54:56.800 --> 3:54:57.800]  We're fighting for America.
[3:54:57.800 --> 3:54:58.800]  We want to be free.
[3:54:58.800 --> 3:55:00.800]  We concern citizens defending freedom.
[3:55:00.800 --> 3:55:02.440]  And it's nonpartisan.
[3:55:02.440 --> 3:55:03.440]  It's nonpartisan.
[3:55:03.440 --> 3:55:05.080]  It's not a partisan play.
[3:55:05.080 --> 3:55:06.080]  We are pro-freedom, pro-America.
[3:55:06.080 --> 3:55:07.080]  That's pro-constitution.
[3:55:07.080 --> 3:55:10.080]  I don't care if you're white, black, orange.
[3:55:10.080 --> 3:55:11.080]  He's a libertarian.
[3:55:11.080 --> 3:55:12.080]  We used to be Democrats.
[3:55:12.080 --> 3:55:14.840]  It doesn't make any difference.
[3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:17.960]  This is about this country's future.
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:20.000]  Get involved in this country and figure out how
[3:55:20.000 --> 3:55:21.440]  you're gonna get involved.
[3:55:21.440 --> 3:55:25.320]  Not everybody has the fiber to serve in the military,
[3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:27.040]  but you have got to figure out how you're gonna
[3:55:27.040 --> 3:55:28.440]  serve this country.
[3:55:28.440 --> 3:55:30.600]  And you do it by, if no other reason, if you just
[3:55:30.600 --> 3:55:32.920]  want to be kind of meek and quiet at home, but you're
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:35.400]  like, I know I got to do something, join this
[3:55:35.400 --> 3:55:37.880]  organization and find out what they're doing, and then
[3:55:37.880 --> 3:55:41.240]  help them in ways that you never thought you'd help.
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:43.960]  So my big thing is local action.
[3:55:43.960 --> 3:55:46.200]  What they're saying right now is so key, as we're
[3:55:46.200 --> 3:55:49.480]  about to conclude this Alex Jones transmission, the
[3:55:49.480 --> 3:55:53.760]  Alex Jones show heading into Thanksgiving weekend.
[3:55:53.760 --> 3:55:59.080]  We need to be thanking the individuals from doctors and nurses
[3:55:59.080 --> 3:56:02.360]  and truckers and teachers and everybody else who have
[3:56:02.360 --> 3:56:07.280]  refused to submit to the vaccine mandate.
[3:56:07.280 --> 3:56:10.800]  That's a level of grassroots activism and pushback that
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:14.520]  everybody can execute.
[3:56:14.520 --> 3:56:16.680]  And so it's little resistance factors here and little
[3:56:16.680 --> 3:56:19.640]  pockets of resistance there and just standing firm as
[3:56:19.640 --> 3:56:21.920]  individuals against this tyranny.
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:25.160]  Now, you've seen most of the video, but there is still a
[3:56:25.160 --> 3:56:26.880]  little bit more that we can't play as we're running out
[3:56:26.880 --> 3:56:27.880]  of time.
[3:56:27.880 --> 3:56:30.440]  Go to band.video right now if you want to watch the
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:33.080]  conclusion of this or share it or see the whole thing
[3:56:33.080 --> 3:56:35.480]  without the breaks.
[3:56:35.480 --> 3:56:38.880]  General Flynn, Patrick Byrne, talk January 6, 2022
[3:56:38.880 --> 3:56:40.960]  election and more, and you can see it there on the
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:45.680]  Alex Jones show page at band.video.
[3:56:45.680 --> 3:56:48.040]  Remember, ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com.
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:51.600]  We've got vitamin mineral fusion back in stock.
[3:56:51.600 --> 3:56:52.840]  This is one of the top sellers.
[3:56:52.840 --> 3:56:55.200]  Top rated supplements at infowarstore.com.
[3:56:55.200 --> 3:56:58.880]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock on sale right now.
[3:56:58.880 --> 3:57:01.200]  It sells out quick, so take advantage.
[3:57:01.200 --> 3:57:03.240]  I start every day with vitamin mineral fusion.
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:06.560]  I like to mix it with a little juice, a little water for
[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:10.400]  flavor, and then I chase down all the supplements from
[3:57:10.400 --> 3:57:14.160]  infowarstore.com with my vitamin mineral fusion drink mix
[3:57:14.160 --> 3:57:15.600]  every morning.
[3:57:15.600 --> 3:57:19.560]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:26.960]  So that does it for this Alex Jones show.
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:29.240]  Obviously, we will be off for Thanksgiving, but we will be
[3:57:29.240 --> 3:57:31.640]  running replays with a lot of powerful information if you
[3:57:31.640 --> 3:57:33.680]  want to still tune into that.
[3:57:33.680 --> 3:57:36.760]  And though I conclude this Alex Jones transmission, I'll be
[3:57:36.760 --> 3:57:41.880]  back in two minutes to host The War Room.
[3:57:41.880 --> 3:57:42.520]  So don't miss it.
[3:57:42.520 --> 3:57:43.680]  We'll be right back.
[3:57:45.760 --> 3:57:47.160]  I know you're humble.
[3:57:47.160 --> 3:57:48.880]  I know you're like me.
[3:57:48.880 --> 3:57:54.120]  But I really want you to sit back and cogitate or meditate
[3:57:54.120 --> 3:57:57.600]  on the fact that those of you that have supported my
[3:57:57.600 --> 3:58:00.640]  broadcast and infowarstore over the years have changed the
[3:58:00.640 --> 3:58:01.720]  world in incredible ways.
[3:58:01.720 --> 3:58:08.880]  And now as 2021 prepares to end and 2022 begins to dawn, it
[3:58:08.880 --> 3:58:12.160]  is more important than ever that you realize how important
[3:58:12.160 --> 3:58:15.120]  you are and that you be more active than you've ever been.
[3:58:15.120 --> 3:58:17.360]  The tip of the sphere is Band-Aid video.
[3:58:17.360 --> 3:58:19.280]  The very front lines of the fight for human
[3:58:19.280 --> 3:58:21.440]  liberty is infowars.com.
[3:58:21.440 --> 3:58:23.760]  And we can't stay on air without your support.
[3:58:23.760 --> 3:58:26.160]  So thank you all for your support.
[3:58:26.160 --> 3:58:28.880]  Donate to our Legal Defense Fund to stay on the air at
[3:58:28.880 --> 3:58:32.960]  saveinfowarwars.com, at saveinfowars.com, and continue
[3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:34.960]  to go to infowarstore.com.
[3:58:34.960 --> 3:58:38.000]  For right now, we've got Turbo Force sold out for months,
[3:58:38.000 --> 3:58:41.760]  10 hours of energy, back in stock for free shipping, 40%
[3:58:41.760 --> 3:58:45.880]  off, and so many other great products.
[3:58:45.880 --> 3:58:48.680]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action.
[3:58:48.680 --> 3:58:51.200]  And there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[3:58:51.200 --> 3:58:54.720]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly,
[3:58:54.720 --> 3:58:57.640]  and debilitating experimental injection because they were
[3:58:57.640 --> 3:59:01.240]  told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[3:59:01.240 --> 3:59:04.280]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[3:59:04.280 --> 3:59:07.160]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an
[3:59:07.160 --> 3:59:11.240]  artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[3:59:11.240 --> 3:59:14.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know
[3:59:14.000 --> 3:59:16.560]  this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably
[3:59:16.560 --> 3:59:17.960]  unsettling to see.
[3:59:17.960 --> 3:59:20.520]  But there is only two things to do.
[3:59:20.520 --> 3:59:23.640]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:59:23.640 --> 3:59:26.960]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:59:26.960 --> 3:59:30.200]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of
[3:59:30.200 --> 3:59:32.360]  convenience are soon coming to an end.
[3:59:32.360 --> 3:59:35.240]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of
[3:59:35.240 --> 3:59:39.080]  storable foods, water filtration, survival gear,
[3:59:39.080 --> 3:59:43.360]  seeds, shortwave radios, and lifesaving knowledge at
[3:59:43.360 --> 3:59:44.600]  InforStore.com.
[3:59:49.080 --> 3:59:52.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the
[3:59:52.480 --> 4:00:13.960]  resistance.
