[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's now undeniable, Joe Biden is, well, at the very least, inept
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.080]  and at the most, wholly corrupt.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.000]  But it's now the political process playing out that has a lot of liberals realizing what
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.440]  a con job Joe Biden has been and what a con job the Democrat Party has been as well.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.200]  Biden doesn't do any media.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.120]  He doesn't do any press conferences.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.380]  Today, he's walking away from the media.
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.440]  They can't get any questions in.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.900]  He's asked why he doesn't have any campaign rallies.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.360]  He just laughs, snickers, flashes his aviator sunglasses and walks on.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.000]  He's too cool for the media.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.800]  George Soros's son, Alex Soros, has reportedly visited the White House 17 times, is that
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.800]  who's really running the country.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.960]  And now that Robert Kennedy Jr.'s poll numbers are rising, the regime is terrified and the
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.200]  Democrat Party is terrified.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.400]  Now, even liberals in Hollywood are realizing what a con job the Democrat Party is.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.960]  Here's James Van Der Beek.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.080]  This video has gone massively viral now.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.600]  Breaking down, how is it the Democrat Party is rigging their own elections and claiming
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.280]  to fight for democracy when they're actually destroying it?
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.160]  See, by the people, it's a democracy by them for who?
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.000]  Big banks, big business, big business, big tech, big pharma, big government, big whatever.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.680]  I mean, what the hell?
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.040]  How is this a democracy?
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.520]  And how is anybody in the DNC right today going to post about thanking our troops and
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.660]  thanking the families who have made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our democracy and our
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.660]  way of freedom?
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.160]  And listen, I am grateful for them.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.240]  But any member of the DNC who's going to think about posting that today, stop, think and
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.080]  do your job before you start posting about how grateful you are.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.120]  There are people out there who are willing to die to preserve democracy because you are
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.400]  not preserving democracy right now.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.640]  You're shoehorning your pick and forcing it on the rest of us.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.640]  And don't tell me that the other candidates aren't serious because one of them is polling
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640]  at 7 percent.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.880]  The other one is at 19 percent.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.640]  That is a quarter of the vote who already thinks there's at the very least some debate
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640]  about who ought to be president.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640]  There's no debate.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.480]  There's no democracy.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.520]  No primary, no legitimate president.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.600]  Thank you to all the troops.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.640]  Thank you to the families who have made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our way of
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.640]  life, to preserve our democracy.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.760]  Let's all do our part.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.520]  We need a debate.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520]  How do we have a government?
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.600]  How do we have a democracy if we're letting a small little backroom of people make all
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.720]  the important decisions for us?
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.720]  That's not a democracy.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.640]  And it doesn't work because you all have been wrong about a lot these last couple of years
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.320]  in that backroom.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.080]  No debate, no democracy.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]  I could be wrong.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080]  That's the thing.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.400]  I could be wrong about all this.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.440]  I could be wrong about the guy being fit for the job.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.040]  I could be wrong about the other people being right, being legitimate, being crazy.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.720]  You know what would solve that?
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.680]  A debate.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680]  Have a debate.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.080]  I could be wrong about that.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.400]  Now folks, the realization here at the surface level is, wow, the Democrats rigged their
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]  primaries.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.720]  Well, that's been going on for decades.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.600]  The deeper realization here is what's said at the end.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.960]  Folks, we don't have a democracy if we don't have debate.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.560]  We don't have democracy if we don't have public discourse.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.880]  If we don't have discussion.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.360]  And that's why the debate has been shut down.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.080]  That's why they've tried to get Alex Jones, myself, Infowars off the air, off the internet.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.640]  It's why they're now trying to do the same thing to Tucker Carlson and all the other individuals
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.640]  that have been censored.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.520]  Whether you agree with their politics, their commentary or not, you cannot have democracy
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.920]  without discourse, discussion, and debate.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.840]  And who is it that's shutting down that debate?
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.400]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.480]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.520]  It will change your life.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.000]  The UN admits, and the Lancet Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.240]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.760]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.480]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.800]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.080]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080]  effect.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.280]  It's very hard to produce.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.920]  And it's finally back in stock.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.920]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.080]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.400]  You and your family need it.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.600]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.920]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920]  Take action now.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:11.040]  But regardless, research is info.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.760]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.520]  Well so does he.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.800]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:33.240]  An honor, a privilege, a blessing that we are live here on this Thursday, June 1st,
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.240]  2023.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.120]  Owen Troyer live broadcasting from the Infowars world headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.840]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us shortly.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.160]  Loaded, loaded news transmission today.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.480]  Tons of video clips.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.320]  Where to begin?
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.480]  You've got the corruption at the FBI has never been more clear.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.760]  It's never been more obvious.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.240]  It's never been more exposed.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.200]  And now when the FBI gets asked about it, they just say, yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, we're
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.200]  corrupt.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.360]  Yeah, we protected the Clintons and now the Bidens and yeah, illegitimately went after
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360]  Trump.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360]  Yeah, it's all true.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360]  But so what?
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360]  So what?
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360]  You can't do anything about it.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.360]  You're not going to do anything about it.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.160]  So just get out of our way, okay?
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.320]  Just shut up.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.480]  Christopher Wray is asked about all the documents that they're protecting right now that expose
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.080]  the Biden-Cram family.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.960]  And Wray just says, hey, you know what?
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.960]  Buzz off.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.960]  Buzz off.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.200]  I don't have to listen to you.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.200]  I'm the head of the FBI.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.760]  And I didn't even realize this.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.480]  When I sent the crew that clip of James Comey, I don't know what's going on here.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:56.320]  James Comey did a media blitz this week and was on CNN multiple times and was on MSNBC.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.920]  And it's just stunning stuff.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.720]  This is the guy who covered up for Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:07.200]  This is the guy who was there for the illegitimate spying investigations into Donald Trump.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.440]  And now he's going on TV saying Trump is the worst thing that's ever happened to the
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.320]  country.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.800]  And the FBI may have faults, but overall, they're always doing the right thing and you need
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.360]  to trust them.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.120]  So you have James Comey going on the mainstream news this week running cover.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.240]  That's the state of affairs at the FBI right now.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:35.120]  That's how hurting the FBI is right now when it comes to public image.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.360]  It is a disaster.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.280]  Public trust in the FBI is at almost zero.
[00:08:40.393 --> 00:08:49.993]  So they have James Comey, who's one of the most corrupt FBI officials of all time, going
[00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:54.593]  on television trying to run cover, assuring you everything's fine at the FBI, everything
[00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:56.753]  is square.
[00:08:56.753 --> 00:09:00.153]  The guy that got fired.
[00:09:00.153 --> 00:09:06.593]  But okay, so we've got more on the FBI, and you know, I like James Comer and these other
[00:09:06.593 --> 00:09:13.793]  guys in the Republican House that are trying to put the screws on the FBI to release these
[00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:15.073]  documents.
[00:09:15.073 --> 00:09:16.553]  They get no help from Kevin McCarthy.
[00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:20.633]  They get a little like a breath of air.
[00:09:20.633 --> 00:09:25.553]  It's like if you're running a wind sprint and someone's like, oh, I'll help you.
[00:09:25.553 --> 00:09:27.713]  I'll breathe behind you.
[00:09:27.713 --> 00:09:29.433]  I'll get behind you and I'll breathe.
[00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:31.073]  Well, that's not going to help me at all.
[00:09:31.073 --> 00:09:33.193]  But there you are.
[00:09:33.193 --> 00:09:35.033]  You're going to be there, though.
[00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:39.773]  And then apparently today some group is going to start leaking.
[00:09:39.773 --> 00:09:42.353]  They're saying leaking.
[00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:47.873]  At least 10,000 images or videos.
[00:09:47.873 --> 00:09:50.833]  From Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:55.373]  Now, look, I'm I'm in between.
[00:09:55.373 --> 00:10:00.273]  We could come on air and we could build this up and we could really make a big deal of
[00:10:00.273 --> 00:10:05.593]  this and probably get a lot more eyes on these images.
[00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:06.593]  Here's the problem.
[00:10:06.593 --> 00:10:08.633]  I don't have any control over this release.
[00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:14.393]  I don't know what they're going to release and most likely everything that they're going
[00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:20.953]  to release are allegedly going to leak today at Biden laptop media dot com has probably
[00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:24.353]  already been out there.
[00:10:24.353 --> 00:10:29.513]  But OK, so they're doing this build up a new website and they're going to release over
[00:10:29.513 --> 00:10:35.793]  10,000 images from over a decade of Hunter Biden's laptop activity.
[00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:37.233]  So you can only imagine what's on there.
[00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:49.708]  But it's like, do I really want to show you images of whoever it is, but let's say it's
[00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:56.348]  Hunter Biden doing pornographic videos with young people?
[00:10:56.523 --> 00:11:02.523]  Do I really want to show that? Do I really want to build that up?
[00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:09.429]  But see, then it gets back to the issue. Where is the FBI?
[00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:14.429]  Where is the Department of Justice? They're the ones covering it up,
[00:11:14.429 --> 00:11:21.429]  and that's why independent journalists have to make new websites to release this to the public.
[00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:23.429]  So you've got that going on.
[00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:26.429]  Then you've got the situation in Ukraine and Russia.
[00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:32.429]  Missiles just falling onto the streets in Kiev.
[00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:36.429]  This whole situation is a little odd.
[00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:41.429]  The Biden administration just the other day sent $300 million to Ukraine.
[00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:49.429]  Another $300 million. Very unpopular. Very unpopular.
[00:11:49.429 --> 00:11:53.429]  And then, magically, this missile just falls out of the sky,
[00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:58.429]  and then a drone blows up an apartment building.
[00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:03.429]  And then they say the $300 million that Joe Biden gave Ukraine
[00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:06.429]  saved millions of lives from a Russian attack,
[00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:11.429]  and they claim that those were the only two missiles, or the only two incidents,
[00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:15.429]  that couldn't stop with Russia's assault on Kiev.
[00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:23.429]  So somebody launches a false, or rather a dud missile that just lands on the streets,
[00:12:23.429 --> 00:12:27.429]  and then there's multiple video angles of it?
[00:12:27.429 --> 00:12:30.429]  Or is that just a blessing that that thing didn't blow up?
[00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:34.429]  And then there's a drone that blows up at an apartment building
[00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:39.429]  that apparently nobody was in at the time, does some damage,
[00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:43.429]  and then Ukraine says, we just got assaulted.
[00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:49.429]  We just got assaulted by Russia, but thanks to the $300 million that Joe Biden gave us,
[00:12:49.429 --> 00:12:52.429]  we were able to stave off the attack.
[00:12:52.429 --> 00:13:00.429]  So I'm supposed to believe that when the Biden administration
[00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:08.429]  agreed to send another $300 million to Ukraine on Tuesday,
[00:13:08.429 --> 00:13:13.429]  on Tuesday, somehow, between Tuesday and Thursday,
[00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:15.429]  the $300 million transfer was made.
[00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:20.429]  You were able to purchase all of these things, these defense systems,
[00:13:20.429 --> 00:13:23.429]  air defense systems and everything, put them in place,
[00:13:23.429 --> 00:13:27.429]  and then Russia attacks Kiev right after you send the money,
[00:13:27.429 --> 00:13:29.429]  and then magically you're able to stop the attack,
[00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:32.429]  except for two things that do minimal damage.
[00:13:32.429 --> 00:13:36.429]  That's what they want you to believe.
[00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:42.429]  Okay, so what? So $300 million more tomorrow for Ukraine?
[00:13:42.429 --> 00:13:44.429]  Oh, but I've got all kinds of videos.
[00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:49.429]  It's in Chicago, it's in Oakland, it's all these Democrat cities
[00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:52.429]  where the illegal immigrants are taking over,
[00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:55.429]  and the cities continue to fund the illegal immigration,
[00:13:55.429 --> 00:14:01.429]  and they go to city council meetings, local board meetings.
[00:14:01.429 --> 00:14:04.429]  They do just live streams on their small channels that they have
[00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:06.429]  or on their Facebook pages, and they just say,
[00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:10.429]  hey, what's going on? Why do we keep getting screwed?
[00:14:10.429 --> 00:14:12.429]  Look at my city in Oakland, it's falling apart.
[00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:16.429]  Look at my city in Chicago, it's falling apart.
[00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:19.429]  Here the city just gave tens of millions of dollars to illegal immigrants,
[00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:23.429]  closed down schools, gave the school buildings to illegal immigrants,
[00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:26.429]  and now hundreds of millions of dollars for Ukraine.
[00:14:26.429 --> 00:14:29.429]  Oh, but they protected Kiev, see, it's so important.
[00:14:29.429 --> 00:14:32.429]  No, and the people in these Democrat cities are saying,
[00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:35.429]  what is going on?
[00:14:35.429 --> 00:14:39.429]  So see, even the awakening is on with the left side
[00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:45.429]  of the American political spectrum.
[00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:48.429]  Now, it might be different than the awakening happening on the right,
[00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:56.429]  but they have put such hate in the Democrat voters' hearts
[00:14:56.429 --> 00:14:58.429]  and not delivered anything for them,
[00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:04.429]  that hate is going to start being directed inward
[00:15:04.429 --> 00:15:06.429]  at the very people that have been lying to them for years.
[00:15:06.429 --> 00:15:09.429]  So you can only get people to hate the Republicans for so long.
[00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:11.429]  The truth is, Republicans, conservatives,
[00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:13.429]  they're not the ones that want to interfere in your life.
[00:15:13.429 --> 00:15:17.429]  They're not the ones that are trying to involve themselves in your life.
[00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:19.429]  That's the left.
[00:15:19.429 --> 00:15:22.429]  And so finally, it's like the American left is realizing,
[00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:25.429]  you know, you keep telling me to hate conservatives and Republicans,
[00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:28.429]  but they're not the ones running my cities.
[00:15:28.429 --> 00:15:29.429]  They're not the ones running our schools.
[00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:32.429]  They're not the ones sending all the money to Ukraine.
[00:15:32.429 --> 00:15:34.429]  And you've got me all hopped up on hate now.
[00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:37.429]  I'm kind of starting to hate you, so we'll show you some of that.
[00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:40.429]  Oh, they tell you they got the new story out today
[00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:43.429]  in the Associated Press, and they've syndicated it.
[00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:46.429]  We're dead, folks. Earth is dead.
[00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:49.429]  So, you know, celebrate your last pride month accordingly.
[00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:52.429]  And, of course, we'll have some of the news on that as well.

[00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:08.429]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:20.429]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:23.429]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:26.429]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it,
[00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:27.429]  wherever you want it.
[00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:29.429]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:33.429]  the Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.

[00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:39.429]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[00:17:39.429 --> 00:17:42.429]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:44.429]  the real NPR of the base, right?

[00:17:49.429 --> 00:17:51.429]  It will take you directly to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:52.429]  Buy something.
[00:17:52.429 --> 00:17:53.429]  Support the InfoWars.
[00:17:53.429 --> 00:17:56.429]  Keep Alex Jones, Orange Hoyer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King,
[00:17:56.429 --> 00:17:57.429]  and the rest of us on air.
[00:17:57.429 --> 00:17:58.429]  Do it today.
[00:17:58.429 --> 00:17:59.429]  Do it now.
[00:17:59.429 --> 00:18:01.429]  Support the InfoWars.
[00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:05.429]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:07.429]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:18:07.429 --> 00:18:11.429]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:18:11.429 --> 00:18:14.429]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes,
[00:18:14.429 --> 00:18:20.429]  the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:18:20.429 --> 00:18:22.429]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:27.429]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week,
[00:18:27.429 --> 00:18:29.429]  it's really just incredible.
[00:18:29.429 --> 00:18:32.429]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:36.429]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air
[00:18:36.429 --> 00:18:38.429]  if you do not support us.
[00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:39.429]  I know you spread the word.
[00:18:39.429 --> 00:18:40.429]  I know you pray for us.
[00:18:40.429 --> 00:18:41.429]  And that's wonderful.
[00:18:41.429 --> 00:18:42.429]  Keep doing it.
[00:18:42.429 --> 00:18:45.429]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:18:45.429 --> 00:18:48.429]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[00:18:48.429 --> 00:18:50.429]  all at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:18:50.429 --> 00:18:54.429]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:54.429 --> 00:18:58.429]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com,
[00:18:58.429 --> 00:18:59.429]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:01.429]  Please take action now.
[00:19:01.429 --> 00:19:05.429]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[00:19:05.429 --> 00:19:09.429]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:11.429]  Here is a bulletin from CBS News.
[00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:13.429]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[00:19:13.429 --> 00:19:17.429]  This is a different kind of war.
[00:19:17.429 --> 00:19:21.429]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:25.429]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:29.429]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:31.429]  It was almost as if there were a plan in force.
[00:19:31.429 --> 00:19:33.429]  It just can't end.
[00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:35.429]  We need to go into the capital.
[00:19:35.429 --> 00:19:37.429]  Death, death, death.
[00:19:37.429 --> 00:19:39.429]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.429]  They are nothing but distractions.
[00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:43.429]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors.
[00:19:43.429 --> 00:19:45.429]  You silenced those voices.
[00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:49.429]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[00:19:49.429 --> 00:19:52.429]  Soon as we start exposing the Great Reset,
[00:19:52.429 --> 00:19:56.429]  the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[00:19:56.429 --> 00:20:00.429]  The New World Order
[00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:05.429]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:07.429]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:19.429]  So we've got a ton of big news today,
[00:20:19.429 --> 00:20:23.429]  but I think we really need to be applying pressure
[00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:27.429]  to the FBI right now
[00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:35.429]  because to me this is just a wide open corruption case.
[00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:37.429]  Open and shut.
[00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:39.429]  Couldn't be more obvious.
[00:20:39.429 --> 00:20:41.429]  The American people see through it
[00:20:41.429 --> 00:20:45.429]  and it's in such a dramatic state now that you have James Comey.
[00:20:45.429 --> 00:20:47.429]  Imagine James Comey.
[00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:49.429]  This is a disgraced FBI director.
[00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:54.429]  Maybe the most corrupt director of the FBI ever.
[00:20:54.429 --> 00:20:56.429]  Arguably.
[00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:58.429]  And he's going on television,
[00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:02.429]  doing multiple interviews on cable news, CNN, MSNBC,
[00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.429]  running cover for the FBI,
[00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:07.429]  trying to tell the American people how solid it is,
[00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:09.429]  how it's not corrupt,
[00:21:09.429 --> 00:21:13.429]  how it's not been politicized.
[00:21:13.429 --> 00:21:16.429]  Folks, that means it's in trouble.
[00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:19.429]  It's in absolute shambles.
[00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:21.429]  And I want to build this up
[00:21:21.429 --> 00:21:23.429]  because I want to get Alex Jones' take on this,
[00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:27.429]  who's going to be coming up in the next segment.
[00:21:27.429 --> 00:21:30.429]  Because to me this is the wide opening right here.
[00:21:30.429 --> 00:21:32.429]  This is the open shot.
[00:21:32.429 --> 00:21:34.429]  This is the slam dunk.
[00:21:34.429 --> 00:21:37.429]  This is the wide open empty net in the Stanley Cup Finals.
[00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:40.429]  This is the goalie out of the goalie's box in the World Cup.
[00:21:40.429 --> 00:21:41.429]  I mean, this is it.
[00:21:41.429 --> 00:21:44.429]  Put the ball in the goal.
[00:21:44.429 --> 00:21:47.429]  It's never been more obvious the corruption of the FBI.
[00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:52.429]  The American people have never been so responsive to this information.
[00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:56.429]  And it looks to me like the one obstacle is Kevin McCarthy.
[00:21:56.429 --> 00:21:59.429]  Now, here's just what we have in the news today.
[00:21:59.429 --> 00:22:00.429]  And again, Alex Jones coming up.
[00:22:00.429 --> 00:22:03.429]  I want to get his take on all of this.
[00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:05.429]  This is being built up.
[00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:08.429]  It's all over the news.
[00:22:08.429 --> 00:22:14.429]  10,000 videos, images are going to be released from the Hunter Biden laptop today.
[00:22:14.429 --> 00:22:16.429]  Now, I don't know what's in this.
[00:22:16.429 --> 00:22:18.429]  I don't want to make this the big story.
[00:22:18.429 --> 00:22:20.429]  The big story needs to be the corruption of the FBI.
[00:22:20.429 --> 00:22:27.429]  The reason why we cover this is because it just highlights the issue.
[00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:31.429]  Now, we can do whataboutism and say if this was Donald Trump Jr.'s laptop
[00:22:31.429 --> 00:22:33.429]  or Eric Trump's laptop or anything like that,
[00:22:33.429 --> 00:22:35.429]  then it would be the big story.
[00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:39.429]  The point is that Hunter Biden's laptop is out there,
[00:22:39.429 --> 00:22:44.429]  and instead of investigating it, the FBI spiked it and told you it didn't exist.
[00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:48.429]  So I don't want to see images of Hunter Biden doing drugs
[00:22:48.429 --> 00:22:53.429]  or engaged in sexual activity with God knows who or what.
[00:22:53.429 --> 00:22:56.429]  I don't want to see that.
[00:22:56.429 --> 00:23:04.429]  But the point is to show that it's there and that the FBI would tell you it's not there.
[00:23:04.429 --> 00:23:06.429]  So the FBI tells you none of this exists.
[00:23:06.429 --> 00:23:08.429]  So okay, none of it exists.
[00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:11.429]  Let's show you all of it then.
[00:23:11.429 --> 00:23:13.429]  Let's show you all of it.
[00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:18.429]  Nearly 10,000 photos from Hunter Biden's laptop to be published online today.
[00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:21.429]  A new website is being created called bidenlaptopmedia.com.
[00:23:21.429 --> 00:23:23.429]  I don't know who's behind it.
[00:23:23.429 --> 00:23:24.429]  I don't know what's coming out.
[00:23:24.429 --> 00:23:27.429]  My guess is most of the stuff that they're going to release is probably already out there.
[00:23:27.429 --> 00:23:30.429]  But the FBI continues to lie about it and tell you it doesn't exist
[00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:36.429]  and send the most disgraced FBI director ever onto TV news to tell you how great the FBI is.
[00:23:36.429 --> 00:23:38.429]  So they're in big trouble.
[00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:40.429]  Now, here's what's going on in the House.
[00:23:40.429 --> 00:23:46.429]  James Comer is trying to get the documents when it comes to the Biden crime family released,
[00:23:46.429 --> 00:23:48.429]  and they are not responding.
[00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:54.429]  The FBI, that is, is not responding to the subpoenas.
[00:23:54.429 --> 00:23:58.429]  FBI won't hand over documents requested by House committee.
[00:23:58.429 --> 00:24:03.429]  James Comer says the FBI will not hand over the documents requested.
[00:24:03.429 --> 00:24:08.429]  The committee is requesting all 1023 forms containing the word Biden.
[00:24:08.429 --> 00:24:10.429]  They haven't released any.
[00:24:10.429 --> 00:24:15.429]  Congress will be taking steps to hold FBI Director Wray in contempt.
[00:24:15.429 --> 00:24:18.429]  I've been hearing this.
[00:24:18.429 --> 00:24:22.429]  I'm not seeing it.
[00:24:22.429 --> 00:24:27.429]  Now the FBI director, Christopher Wray, has confirmed the Biden bribery documents do exist,
[00:24:27.429 --> 00:24:29.429]  but he will not turn them over to Congress.
[00:24:29.429 --> 00:24:34.429]  That is contempt of Congress.
[00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:41.429]  If anybody else didn't respond to a subpoena, they would be brought into court.
[00:24:41.429 --> 00:24:45.429]  In fact, is it Peter Navarro, maybe the Trump adviser?
[00:24:45.429 --> 00:24:47.429]  I think Peter Navarro has to testify today.
[00:24:47.429 --> 00:24:49.429]  Oh, they they subpoena.
[00:24:49.429 --> 00:24:53.429]  They subpoena everybody who gets associated with Trump.
[00:24:53.429 --> 00:24:54.429]  Oh, they'll subpoena.
[00:24:54.429 --> 00:24:58.429]  They'll subpoena little old me and I'll be forced to respond.
[00:24:58.429 --> 00:25:00.429]  But you subpoena a Democrat.
[00:25:00.429 --> 00:25:01.429]  You subpoena the FBI.
[00:25:01.429 --> 00:25:03.429]  You subpoena the Biden crime family.
[00:25:03.429 --> 00:25:04.429]  They don't have to respond.
[00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:05.429]  They don't have to show up to court.
[00:25:05.429 --> 00:25:07.429]  They don't have to show up in front of the committee.
[00:25:07.429 --> 00:25:09.429]  Nothing happens to them.
[00:25:09.429 --> 00:25:12.429]  They're above the law.
[00:25:12.429 --> 00:25:17.429]  National Secretary spokesman John Kirby stumbles pretty much all the time,
[00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:22.429]  but stumbles when asked about Biden bribes and why most Americans believe Biden is corrupt.
[00:25:22.429 --> 00:25:25.429]  Last poll I saw Rasmussen poll.
[00:25:25.429 --> 00:25:29.429]  Sixty five percent of Americans believe that Biden.
[00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:34.429]  And Hunter committed some crimes are guilty of some crimes.
[00:25:34.429 --> 00:25:37.429]  We don't get the investigations.
[00:25:37.429 --> 00:25:40.429]  Award winning journalist Seymour Hersh, he knows it.
[00:25:40.429 --> 00:25:41.429]  Seymour Hersh.
[00:25:41.429 --> 00:25:46.429]  John Durham failed to investigate whether Hillary Clinton had crossed the line as FBI joined ranks with Democrats.
[00:25:46.429 --> 00:25:49.429]  Everybody sees how corrupt the FBI is.
[00:25:49.429 --> 00:25:50.429]  The left used to know this.
[00:25:50.429 --> 00:25:52.429]  The left used to stand against the FBI.
[00:25:52.429 --> 00:25:59.429]  I remember one Democrat president called out the FBI, CIA to such an extent they blew his head off.
[00:25:59.429 --> 00:26:02.429]  I guess that's why the Democrats are too scared to call it out anymore.
[00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:04.429]  Now you've got Hunter Biden's ex-wife.
[00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:07.429]  So it's just, oh, you know, the FBI says none of this exists.
[00:26:07.429 --> 00:26:09.429]  They might just tell you Hunter Biden doesn't even exist.
[00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:11.429]  There is no Hunter Biden.
[00:26:11.429 --> 00:26:14.429]  He's not even real.
[00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:16.429]  He doesn't have an ex-wife.
[00:26:16.429 --> 00:26:21.429]  He didn't sleep with his brother's widow.
[00:26:21.429 --> 00:26:30.429]  He didn't sleep with a exotic dancer, got her pregnant and then abandoned the child and then rushed into another marriage so he could ignore it.
[00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:31.429]  Nope, that didn't happen.
[00:26:31.429 --> 00:26:34.429]  Well, according to his ex-wife, it all did happen.
[00:26:34.429 --> 00:26:36.429]  And now she's writing a book about it.
[00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:41.429]  Quote, this is his ex-wife.
[00:26:41.429 --> 00:26:51.429]  In February 2017, Buell, his ex-wife, alleged in a legal filing that her estranged ex had spent money on drugs, alcohol, prostitutes and strip clubs.
[00:26:51.429 --> 00:26:54.429]  Buell's book doesn't shy away from those previous disclosures.
[00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:59.429]  Instead, it will shine a light on the heavy toll addiction can take on relationships, according to the book's publisher.
[00:26:59.429 --> 00:27:02.429]  Again, and so they make these statements today.
[00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:04.429]  You'll see it all over TV, all over the Internet.
[00:27:04.429 --> 00:27:06.429]  Well, why should I care about what Hunter Biden does?
[00:27:06.429 --> 00:27:11.429]  Why should I care about what Hunter Biden does behind closed doors or on the Internet with hookers?
[00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:14.429]  Well, maybe you should, maybe you shouldn't.
[00:27:14.429 --> 00:27:15.429]  That's not the point.
[00:27:15.429 --> 00:27:23.429]  The point is that, what was it, 51 intelligence agents said that the Hunter Biden laptop was fake.
[00:27:23.429 --> 00:27:28.429]  So we went from the Hunter Biden laptop is fake to I don't care that it's real.
[00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:33.429]  So you see, they'll always move the goalposts.
[00:27:34.429 --> 00:27:42.429]  They'll never, this is the total signs of somebody that can never be honest with you, never have a straightforward conversation with you, can never operate on good faith.
[00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:45.429]  The Hunter Biden laptop doesn't exist.
[00:27:45.429 --> 00:27:47.429]  Fine, it doesn't exist, but I don't care.
[00:27:47.429 --> 00:27:52.429]  And of course, you could do this all day long.
[00:27:52.429 --> 00:27:59.429]  You could go right now to any liberal university, any liberal city and say, look, I've got Don Jr.'s laptop.
[00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:02.429]  He does drugs with prostitutes.
[00:28:02.429 --> 00:28:03.429]  He sells drugs.
[00:28:03.429 --> 00:28:04.429]  And look at these images.
[00:28:04.429 --> 00:28:05.429]  It looks like he's with a minor.
[00:28:05.429 --> 00:28:09.429]  And every liberal Democrat be like, oh, my God, just foaming at the mouth for that information.
[00:28:09.429 --> 00:28:10.429]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:28:10.429 --> 00:28:11.429]  That's Hunter Biden.
[00:28:11.429 --> 00:28:12.429]  No, I don't believe it.
[00:28:12.429 --> 00:28:14.429]  I don't want to say it anymore.
[00:28:14.429 --> 00:28:15.429]  Where's your consistency?
[00:28:15.429 --> 00:28:18.429]  So we're going to be hearing from Alex Jones coming up after this break.
[00:28:18.429 --> 00:28:21.429]  And I want to really dig into this.
[00:28:21.429 --> 00:28:29.429]  Who is who is stopping Congress from holding the FBI accountable?
[00:28:29.429 --> 00:28:33.429]  How can the FBI be so brazen in the face of the American people?
[00:28:33.429 --> 00:28:36.429]  Just say we're not going to respond to your subpoena.
[00:28:36.429 --> 00:28:39.429]  We're not going to go after the criminals if they're a Democrat.
[00:28:39.429 --> 00:28:40.429]  Not going to happen.
[00:28:40.429 --> 00:28:43.429]  We'll illegitimately go after Trump all day long and you'll watch it.
[00:28:43.429 --> 00:28:47.429]  We won't touch a Democrat guilty of anything and everything ever.
[00:28:47.429 --> 00:28:51.429]  Who is obstructing Congress from holding the FBI accountable?
[00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:52.429]  Is it McCarthy?
[00:28:52.429 --> 00:28:53.429]  Is it something else?
[00:28:53.429 --> 00:28:56.429]  We hear from Alex Jones on the other side of this break.
[00:28:56.429 --> 00:28:59.429]  Don't go anywhere on the Alex Jones show.
[00:28:59.429 --> 00:29:01.429]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth.
[00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:05.429]  The solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:29:05.429 --> 00:29:08.429]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:29:08.429 --> 00:29:18.429]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the U.N.'s own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:29:18.429 --> 00:29:31.429]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:29:31.429 --> 00:29:41.429]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:29:41.429 --> 00:29:43.429]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:44.429]  You don't absorb it.
[00:29:44.429 --> 00:29:47.429]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together.
[00:29:47.429 --> 00:29:49.429]  It supercharges your body.
[00:29:49.429 --> 00:29:52.429]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:55.429]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:57.429]  X3, back in stock.
[00:29:57.429 --> 00:29:58.429]  Take action now.
[00:29:58.429 --> 00:29:59.429]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:04.429]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce Plus.
[00:30:04.429 --> 00:30:06.429]  We made it even stronger.
[00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:10.429]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:17.429]  TurboForce is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:17.429 --> 00:30:23.429]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:30:23.429 --> 00:30:25.429]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:30:25.429 --> 00:30:29.429]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things,
[00:30:29.429 --> 00:30:34.429]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart,
[00:30:34.429 --> 00:30:37.429]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:30:37.429 --> 00:30:40.429]  It is the super fuel.
[00:30:40.429 --> 00:30:42.429]  RainForce Plus is great.
[00:30:42.429 --> 00:30:43.429]  RainForce Ultra is great.
[00:30:43.429 --> 00:30:44.429]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:30:44.429 --> 00:30:47.429]  They go good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[00:30:47.429 --> 00:30:49.429]  This is the boss.
[00:30:49.429 --> 00:30:53.429]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:53.429 --> 00:30:59.429]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:03.429]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move
[00:31:03.429 --> 00:31:05.429]  against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:08.429]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:31:08.429 --> 00:31:10.429]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:13.429]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him,
[00:31:13.429 --> 00:31:16.429]  but as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:31:16.429 --> 00:31:20.429]  It's the same thing with InfoWars, but InfoWars is not owned by Fox
[00:31:20.429 --> 00:31:24.429]  or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:31:24.429 --> 00:31:28.429]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners,
[00:31:28.429 --> 00:31:30.429]  and when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:31:30.429 --> 00:31:35.429]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:31:35.429 --> 00:31:38.429]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:41.429]  I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[00:31:41.429 --> 00:31:44.429]  please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:31:44.429 --> 00:31:46.429]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:48.429]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:51.429]  We're all getting great products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com,

[00:31:59.429 --> 00:32:02.429]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:06.429]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:11.429]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:15.429]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population,
[00:32:15.429 --> 00:32:18.429]  and there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:32:18.429 --> 00:32:21.429]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:26.429]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:32:26.429 --> 00:32:30.429]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine,
[00:32:30.429 --> 00:32:35.429]  and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[00:32:35.429 --> 00:32:40.429]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[00:32:40.429 --> 00:32:46.429]  our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:32:46.429 --> 00:32:52.429]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[00:33:00.429 --> 00:33:05.429]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:33:05.429 --> 00:33:07.429]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:38.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live, riding shotgun with me as always.
[00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.070]  It's the great Owen Schroyer.
[00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:48.830]  I will be back in Austin, Texas tomorrow evening and will not be hosting on the road anymore.
[00:33:48.830 --> 00:34:00.470]  On Saturday, we're going to carry live the pre-panel discussion and the premiere of the
[00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:05.630]  Great Awakening film that the amazing Mickey Willis and his team have put together that
[00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:11.230]  is just extremely important to stop the New World Order's operations.
[00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:18.910]  That'll be live streamed in the afternoon, starting at about 4 p.m. at InfoWars.com and
[00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:19.910]  Bandai Video.
[00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:20.910]  Then I'll be back Sunday.
[00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:27.990]  I intend to host all four hours myself, Sunday, back in the saddle.
[00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:31.870]  And then I'm going to be hosting right through the weekdays next week.
[00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:36.710]  And of course, I'm also going to be hosting some other folks' well-known TV programs and
[00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:42.910]  podcasts and co-hosting next week to look for a lot of big news on that front next week.
[00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:50.630]  I decided to take a family vacation for a week and a half, and I decided to take a vacation
[00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:56.910]  in a place where I can conduct an investigation of the globalist building bunkers that we've
[00:34:56.910 --> 00:35:01.870]  known about for a long time and broke about 16, 17 years ago, but it's been accelerating
[00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.830]  since then.
[00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:11.350]  And so I ended up extending my, quote, workcation three days until tomorrow.
[00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:19.110]  I would have already been back in Texas on Tuesday so that I could get some more contacts.
[00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:24.950]  And just for my own safety, the information's already been transmitted to InfoWars.
[00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.870]  And so anything happens to me, that information will still get out.
[00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:33.950]  But in the interest of safety, I'm going to go ahead today at the bottom of the next hour
[00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.230]  and release this information now.
[00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.950]  But let's just leave it at this.
[00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:46.150]  I've been in helicopters, I've been on ships, I have been on the ground.
[00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:52.310]  Not just Mark Zuckerberg, but others, more than 20 of them,
[00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:56.310]  are building underground bunkers in Kauai, Hawaii.
[00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:01.310]  Now, I have interviewed the construction people.
[00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:08.310]  I have talked to more than 15 different individuals, including...
[00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:11.310]  Well, I'm not going to get away too much because I don't want to get them in trouble.
[00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.310]  They all had to sign NDAs, non-disclosure agreements.
[00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:21.310]  But what they believe is going on is criminal or of great public interest.
[00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:27.310]  But what you're going to hear at the bottom of the next hour is something out of a James Bond movie.
[00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.310]  Okay?
[00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:34.310]  Or, you know, like the first Incredibles or something.
[00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:37.310]  But Hollywood really loves to throw it in your face.
[00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:43.310]  But yeah, basically the first Incredibles, underground sub bases, giant robots.
[00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:44.310]  It's here.
[00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.310]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:51.310]  Inside the hollowed out volcanoes, giant robots and submarine bases.
[00:36:52.110 --> 00:37:03.710]  And they've got big, giant plastic tents, big bubbles like the NSA has over its domes.
[00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:07.990]  They have these built so they have underground excavating equipment and there's just dump
[00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.270]  trucks 24-7 driving out with what they're digging out.
[00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:19.350]  That's just at Zuckerberg's house that I am right now five miles from his property.
[00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:28.830]  I've already given some of it away, but I've got photos, I've got videos, it's just insane.
[00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:34.670]  Now all the things I'm talking about here go directly into
[00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:40.950]  what Owen was just talking about, why does the FBI care?
[00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:44.870]  Why does the government care that it's destroying itself in front of everyone and engaging in
[00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.550]  human trafficking and in narcotics trafficking and all these crimes?
[00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.190]  And believe me, there are a lot of people in the federal government that are upset and
[00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.670]  I'm not doing that to kiss their ass.
[00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:59.710]  It just would be a lie if I did not tell you that there are a lot of good people that are
[00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.590]  completely freaked out.
[00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:09.550]  I mean, I've been talking to the highest levels, meeting with them, right below Mayorkas.
[00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.670]  And I'm like, why are you trying to talk to me?
[00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.950]  Well, we're desperate and we're talking to all the top people about, can somebody do
[00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:19.350]  something about this?
[00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.950]  And can you get Tucker to cover it?
[00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:26.029]  Oh yeah, he's fired three days later, he was already on it.
[00:38:26.029 --> 00:38:27.910]  Can you get Joe Rogan to cover it?
[00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.470]  Yeah, sure, I'll give your info to Joe.
[00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:34.150]  I mean, I'm sitting there talking to federal officials, I mean, like people you see on
[00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.150]  TV.
[00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:36.150]  And they're like, look, we can't be part of this.
[00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:40.750]  There's over 5,000 kids in the Texas sector, most of them are being given to pedophiles
[00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.750]  on purpose.
[00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:45.790]  We're giving them to people that are pedophiles that have four or five convictions for raping
[00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.790]  children.
[00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:52.070]  And they're giving us the case information because it's all in federal court where the
[00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:58.950]  Justice Department orders the federal marshals, the FBI, the judges to non-prosecute.
[00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:06.910]  And that will watch them walk with children in many cases.
[00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:10.029]  The best they can do is catch him and take the kids away from him, but then they're told
[00:39:10.029 --> 00:39:11.990]  to give the kids over to an NGO.
[00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:18.710]  My uncle saw this during our encontra on a smaller scale and resigned his secret commission
[00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.870]  from the army over all this.
[00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.590]  And that was a microcosm of what was going on.
[00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.470]  So there are a lot of people freaked out.
[00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:28.790]  If you think it's just us freaked out or you freaked out, you imagine you sign up to the
[00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:34.350]  FBI or federal marshal or you're a federal judge or you're a federal magistrate and you
[00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.550]  have to sit there and watch this go on.
[00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:40.509]  I mean, you know you're aiding and abetting criminal activity.
[00:39:40.509 --> 00:39:47.390]  But that's the $64 trillion, billion dollar question is why don't they seem to care?
[00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.150]  And that really is the answer to everything.
[00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:55.630]  Why on Kauai, Hawaii, are there at least 20 billionaires associated with Zuckerberg all
[00:39:55.630 --> 00:40:02.029]  building underground tunnels interconnected around his property with a secret submarine
[00:40:02.029 --> 00:40:04.270]  base being built?
[00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:09.390]  And why are there 20 foot combat robots there?
[00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:17.509]  Well, because in the future, Zuckerberg is not going to trust troops or citizens or people
[00:40:17.509 --> 00:40:18.750]  he's paid to protect him.
[00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:24.590]  He's got armies of high-tech weaponized drones, a huge security force.
[00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.990]  If you even try to walk on the beach, because under federal and state law, up to the waterline,
[00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:33.550]  the beach is public in Hawaii, same thing in Texas, same thing in Florida.
[00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.910]  He's trying to block that off.
[00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:40.830]  He's got drones, paramilitary troops, if your boat even gets up close to it, here come the
[00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:41.830]  drones.
[00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:47.110]  There's all these bubble giant buildings half the size of football stadiums with all the
[00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.670]  secret construction going on.
[00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:52.390]  I mean, his giant house looks like an ant, that's these big domes.
[00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.390]  Here, here, here, let me just start showing you something.
[00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.390]  Now, I'm going to go ahead and just release all this now.
[00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.390]  I'll tell you next hour.
[00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:03.150]  I mean, you think I'm playing around here, folks, I got it all right here.
[00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:09.190]  So, a couple miles from where I'm sitting, they've got two giant domes.
[00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:15.110]  Yeah, his house is right back there in the background, two giant domes.
[00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:22.790]  And by the way, I was out on this boat with, well, good folks that we worked with to go
[00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:23.790]  out by his property.
[00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.670]  And they said, routinely, if your boat even gets 100 yards offshore, the drones come,
[00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:36.670]  and security comes up, gets your face, and he's routinely out there with white sunscreen
[00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:41.470]  caked all over him, riding around the ocean like he owns everything.
[00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.990]  Now, again, this guy steals all your data, has everything on you.
[00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:51.150]  And he's building an underground base with weapons and robots and a submarine base so
[00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.350]  he can go out to his job and nobody knows.
[00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.910]  Why was James Cameron the first guy?
[00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:07.210]  That I learned of back in 2005 that was moving to New Zealand and had submarines and large
[00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:12.170]  ships preparing for the collapse of civilization because he believed even New Zealand will
[00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.170]  fall.
[00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.730]  Why does Peter Thiel have an underground base in New Zealand?
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:22.540]  But that's been going on a long time.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:27.419]  Why are they now all moving into their bunkers and expanding them?
[00:42:27.419 --> 00:42:30.540]  And I think no matter who you are, whether you're a private citizen or for the government
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.100]  or you're retired or you're 15 years old, you're black or white, you're gay or straight,
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.100]  doesn't matter.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.899]  This is all going to affect you.
[00:42:38.899 --> 00:42:42.700]  So this, this, this all goes to the point of what are they preparing for here?
[00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.020]  I mean, is it a giant asteroid coming?
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.020]  Is it?
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.819]  What is it they know where they don't give a damn about anything now?
[00:42:48.819 --> 00:42:52.620]  We're going to talk about it all when we come back on the other side, but we're going to
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.620]  the heart of the matter straight ahead.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.620]  I don't know.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.620]  Let's go.
[00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:05.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.030]  in plain view.
[00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.030]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:14.030]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:19.030]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:26.030]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:32.030]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:38.030]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:42.030]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.030]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.030]  You don't absorb it.
[00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:50.030]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.030]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:08.030]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies, and
[00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:12.030]  that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.
[00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.030]  It takes commitment.

[00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:09.030]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:13.030]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:16.030]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.030]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:48.030]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action
[00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.030]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's the counter to the
[00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:57.030]  Great Reset, by going to InfoWarsTore.com and clicking on the Donate button and giving
[00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.030]  today.
[00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.030]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:00.030]  Please take action.
[00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:05.030]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.030]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.030]  People said, no way.
[00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.030]  He's the most powerful.
[00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.030]  It never happened.
[00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.030]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:14.030]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him, but
[00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:17.030]  as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:22.030]  It's the same thing with InfoWars, but InfoWars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George
[00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.030]  Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:31.030]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners, and when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:36.030]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:39.030]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.030]  I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand, please
[00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.030]  don't take InfoWars for granted.
[00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:46.030]  We're barely hanging on.
[00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:50.030]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support while getting great
[00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:52.030]  products at the same time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:53.030]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:58.030]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air, and never submit
[00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:59.030]  to these tyrants.
[00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:07.030]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:24.480]  Alright, so coming up at the bottom of the next hour, we have a very important, informative
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.480]  guest joining us.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:30.640]  I'm going to lay out the basics, what we discovered about Mark Zuckerberg, and then when I get
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.600]  back to Austin tomorrow, I'm going to work in the next week or so on putting the video,
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.560]  the research, the information together about what's happening.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.040]  And when I cover this at the bottom of the next hour, I want to remind me, I need to
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.040]  write some notes here.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.319]  I just decided to start talking about this right now, just from a gut level.
[00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:50.240]  I was going to wait until I got back, but I'm going to do it now, and then we'll get
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.640]  more details and flesh out the reports after.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:58.000]  This is a security issue, but remind me to remind folks, we can pull up the articles
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.600]  about the dangerous individuals list put out three years ago, about two years after our
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600]  first banning.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:13.799]  The 12 people were on, myself, Paul Watson, Gav McGinnis, Louis Farrakhan of all people,
[00:48:13.799 --> 00:48:14.799]  and a few others.
[00:48:14.799 --> 00:48:15.799]  Did I mention Paul Watson?
[00:48:15.799 --> 00:48:16.799]  Yeah, he was on there.
[00:48:16.799 --> 00:48:23.759]  Saying, these are dangerous individuals, so you're allowed to not just talk bad about
[00:48:23.759 --> 00:48:24.259]  them.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:31.180]  And when you pull up the actual articles about it, you're allowed to call for violence against them and organized violence.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.180]  Now, that was totally illegal.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.180]  That's where the left wants to go next.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.180]  We know the ADL wrote these guidelines.
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.180]  So they tested their next guideline of organizing violence against us.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.180]  And that's where this always leads.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.180]  And it's now come out the ADL was advising.
[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:54.180]  But Zuckerberg pulled back the calls for organized violence against us, which is criminal mafia racketeering.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.180]  I'm not joking if you're a new viewer or listener.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.180]  This really happened.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:04.180]  There were articles about it saying, has they gone too far calling to organize violence against Alex Jones and Louis Farrakhan?
[00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:10.410]  Now, there is a secret blacklist of dangerous individuals and organizations, but then it
[00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:17.410]  goes on, guys, there's like headlines, Leningradian, you name it, where it calls, it shows, that's
[00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:22.490]  what I'm going to cover next hour so you guys can find it, where it actually calls for violence.
[00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:26.770]  It says, you may call for violence or organized violence against these 12 people.
[00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:31.089]  So we're not just covering their dangerous individuals list, the fact that that exists.
[00:49:31.089 --> 00:49:36.290]  We're covering the first 12 put on it with their rules saying they were allowed to call
[00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.810]  for violence against us.
[00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.649]  There it is, Facebook banned dangerous individuals, decided for hate speech.
[00:49:41.649 --> 00:49:44.729]  It was a double banning, but that's AP.
[00:49:44.729 --> 00:49:49.410]  But the real issue was is that, and Paul Watson wrote about it, just put Infowars.com prefix
[00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:52.649]  on that, you'll be able to find it, with the rules where they pulled them, saying you're
[00:49:52.649 --> 00:49:54.729]  allowed to call for violence against us.
[00:49:54.729 --> 00:49:55.729]  This sounds crazy.
[00:49:55.729 --> 00:49:56.729]  It's real.
[00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:08.649]  So as bad as Zuckerberg is, he said, no, we are not going to call for organized violence
[00:50:08.649 --> 00:50:09.649]  against someone.
[00:50:09.649 --> 00:50:13.649]  And the ADL then, a year later, had a big meeting on TV with Sacha Baron Cohen as their
[00:50:13.649 --> 00:50:14.649]  spokesman.
[00:50:14.649 --> 00:50:20.370]  And they said, we want to put Zuckerberg in prison because he doesn't agree with organizing
[00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:21.370]  violence against Alex Jones, literally.
[00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:24.609]  We should probably kind of pull this together on a report.
[00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:29.490]  That's kind of important, because what they tried to do to us, that was the first bite
[00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:30.490]  of the apple.
[00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:33.330]  Now they're rolling it out against everybody.
[00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:39.169]  So the reason I'm exposing Zuckerberg is not that he's got 50 or 80 billion or 100 billion,
[00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:43.410]  whatever it is, last time, it's always changing, dollars, or that he's got thousands of acres
[00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:45.970]  is building underground compounds.
[00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:48.850]  It's saying, why are they building these?
[00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:53.049]  Why are they getting ready for what they think is basically cataclysmic events?
[00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:58.890]  Remember, a couple of years ago, William Shatner went up on Blue Origin or whatever
[00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:04.770]  the name of Bezos' company is, up into orbit, up into outer space.
[00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:09.330]  And he landed, he said, I looked down on the Earth, a coming cataclysm, and the fact that
[00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:12.810]  everybody has to die for the Earth, almost everyone's going to die.
[00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:16.009]  And it was just so sad, we're going to have to kill everybody.
[00:51:16.009 --> 00:51:22.689]  He's been let in on the club of the real Star Trek future, not the loving you and everybody
[00:51:22.689 --> 00:51:27.330]  lives in peace, that comes after they build back better, when 90 plus percent of us are
[00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:28.330]  wiped out.
[00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:32.490]  Of course, they're telling that 10%, you're going to survive, but then they find out later,
[00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:33.490]  no, you're going to get it too.
[00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:40.169]  And he said, oh, you're going to be left alive when we kill everybody else, oh, sorry, you're
[00:51:40.169 --> 00:51:41.169]  all gone.
[00:51:41.169 --> 00:51:42.169]  See how that works?
[00:51:42.169 --> 00:51:48.850]  So I want everybody to get big picture here.
[00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:53.649]  I'm not here to cover the 20 billionaires in Zuckerberg, because I'm mad at them, or
[00:51:53.649 --> 00:51:57.450]  even though they're out there censoring me and attacking me.
[00:51:57.450 --> 00:52:00.609]  I'm here to ask the question, why are they digging in like it's the end of the world?
[00:52:00.609 --> 00:52:03.569]  So we'll cover that at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:52:03.569 --> 00:52:14.129]  But you were asking the question, Owen, and the actual number was 67% of Americans believe
[00:52:14.129 --> 00:52:17.649]  Biden has committed crimes and impeachable offenses, and then that's in a mainline poll.
[00:52:17.649 --> 00:52:18.649]  It's actually much higher.
[00:52:18.649 --> 00:52:22.410]  And of course, he's only got like 30% approval rating in the Democratic Party.
[00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:27.290]  In many polls, he's in a dead heat with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., or in other polls, Kennedy
[00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.009]  is like five, 10 points behind.
[00:52:29.009 --> 00:52:30.009]  That's unheard of.
[00:52:30.009 --> 00:52:33.770]  Kennedy would be the Democrat nominee if he's allowed to be in the debates, if he wasn't
[00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:34.770]  being censored.
[00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:35.770]  Very smart, great guy.
[00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:39.169]  Too bad his voice is shot, and my voice is half shot too.
[00:52:39.169 --> 00:52:44.410]  It's about content, not even, you know, the other day, how it's quote, quote, deliberated.
[00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:50.529]  It's about the actual goods, the actual policies.
[00:52:50.529 --> 00:52:56.490]  And so you have to understand, the FBI and these people, it's just a rearguard action.
[00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:59.649]  They're just there to protect the globalists while they dig in and build armored fortresses
[00:52:59.649 --> 00:53:00.649]  around the world.
[00:53:00.649 --> 00:53:01.649]  And, oh, good, they found it.
[00:53:01.649 --> 00:53:07.810]  I'm glad the guys found it, but you guys have got 40 minutes to find it.
[00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:11.729]  We wrote articles at Infowars.com, it was a big story, Cernovich wrote about it.
[00:53:11.729 --> 00:53:12.729]  We had screenshots.
[00:53:12.729 --> 00:53:13.729]  It was all over AP Reuters.
[00:53:14.049 --> 00:53:19.330]  I mean, you showed those headlines, but you want screenshots of the policies.
[00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:21.850]  Call Laura Loomer, she'll know how to find it.
[00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:22.850]  I love the crew.
[00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:23.850]  They're the best.
[00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:28.210]  We had this one guy, worked here a few years ago, who always could find things instantly,
[00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:29.210]  but he had to move on.
[00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:34.290]  And now it's one of these pet peeves with me when I just, I mean, it's the policy saying
[00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.769]  you're allowed to call for violence against us.
[00:53:36.769 --> 00:53:38.129]  That is so bombshell.
[00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:42.470]  Maybe I just will go off the air until we find it.
[00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.550]  I'm not mad, just to build suspense.
[00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:47.830]  Okay, if you find it, good, cuz I want it already at the bottom of the NRA,
[00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:50.550]  cuz I want people to understand what we're up against here.
[00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:54.150]  I mean, do people understand the magnitude of Facebook putting out rules?
[00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.590]  That you're allowed to organize plans to carry out violence against Alex Jones,
[00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:01.270]  Louis Farrakhan, Paul Joseph Watson, Gavin McGinnis, and like six,
[00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:02.790]  seven other, Laura Loomer was on there.
[00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:11.330]  And then a week later, they take it down because of such an incredible, massive backlash.
[00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:16.490]  I'll call Paul Watson during the break, he'll know how to pull it up, no big deal.
[00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:22.210]  But yes, guys, I know you've got the articles in AP and Reuters about us being that special
[00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:23.490]  dangerous persons list.
[00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:28.609]  I want the shot of the rules, or maybe you can send them to me, maybe I saw them on screen,
[00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:29.609]  I wasn't sure.
[00:54:29.609 --> 00:54:32.210]  And then I want to make a big deal about that, because I don't want to just make a claim
[00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:33.210]  about CNN.
[00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:38.129]  I don't just make a claim, and then not show them, I will show it, I will show it.
[00:54:38.129 --> 00:54:44.330]  Now, continuing here, Owen's asking the question of.
[00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:47.430]  Why?
[00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.430]  Don't they care?
[00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.430]  And that's the answer to everything.
[00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:53.430]  They don't care because they're just followers that were chosen because they knew what they were told,
[00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.430]  even though they're burning down their own country.
[00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.430]  So, we're not going to just sit there and ever plan on the FBI or Justice Department to ever do anything.
[00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:03.430]  We have to, at the state level, have Attorney Generals and others indict.
[00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.430]  And Soros knows the power of that.
[00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:07.430]  That's why he's been trying to get control of all the State Attorney Generals.
[00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.430]  But something like 28 of them are not under his control.
[00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:14.370]  And there's thousands of prosecutors locally.
[00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:19.370]  Look what Jim Garrison did out of New Orleans by himself, almost brought down the deep state.
[00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:22.370]  So there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:29.370]  We have to stop sitting here and hoping that a captured criminal organization at the top is going to fix the country.
[00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.370]  They're not.
[00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.370]  They know what they're doing.
[00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:32.370]  They're in on it.
[00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:33.370]  They love it.
[00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:36.370]  It doesn't matter if the mid and low level aren't bad people.
[00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:37.370]  They're not in control.
[00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:40.370]  They're like little kids in the back of the minivan, three rows back.
[00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:45.370]  And you got psychotics on PCP driving $100 an hour down the road with their lights off at night.
[00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:46.370]  Okay.
[00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:48.370]  So, you know, well, some of the guys good.
[00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:49.370]  Yeah.
[00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:51.370]  And they're in child safety seats in the back eating boogers.
[00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:52.370]  Okay.
[00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.370]  All right.
[00:55:53.370 --> 00:56:01.370]  They're back there eating boogers in the back of the car and, you know, sucking on lollipops while the whole thing.
[00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:04.370]  So just I'm not going to worry about people in the back of the minivan.
[00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:05.370]  Okay.
[00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:12.370]  I'm trying to get control of the driver at the front and before we go off the damn cliff here, we're going to go to break.
[00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:13.370]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:16.370]  And we've got so much to cover, so much to go over.
[00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:18.370]  And yes, we will talk about Biden and Kirby.
[00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:27.370]  And everybody keeps talking about the hookers and the cocaine and even the underage kids that are obviously in these photos.
[00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:33.370]  I started looking at the Hunter Biden things right before the election in 2020.
[00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:35.370]  And I made the decision not to look at it.
[00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:38.370]  And I never tell the crew what to do because I trust them and I like them.
[00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:40.370]  And, you know, I tell them, hey, you might want to cover this.
[00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:41.370]  Hey, let's do that.
[00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:44.370]  But I did say, I don't want any of you looking at the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.370]  I believe it's illegal.
[00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.370]  And reviewing child porn is illegal.
[00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:51.370]  Even if you're an investigative journalist, it's very questionable.
[00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:57.370]  And I said, I don't want any of you looking at that because I spent about 10 hours looking at it.
[00:56:57.370 --> 00:57:00.370]  And it was 16, 15-year-old girls.
[00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:06.370]  It was him with his kids, him with his family's kids, six, seven-year-old girls, trophy photos.
[00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:10.370]  Him in a robe was, you know, Pecker hanging out with a little girl.
[00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:12.370]  It's pedo stuff.
[00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:14.370]  And I don't want to look at it, so I quit looking at it.
[00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:17.370]  Around when I ran into that, I said, okay.
[00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:20.370]  And I hadn't even gotten 10 percent into it, okay.
[00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.370]  And I've talked to folks that have seen it.
[00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:22.370]  It is hellish.
[00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:24.370]  But that's not the issue.
[00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:25.370]  Oh, that's bad enough.
[00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:28.370]  He's a freaking Chinese spy, and there's audio recordings of him.
[00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:31.370]  We've played here where he says that.
[00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:36.370]  So, yeah, I say put it out to the four winds now and just let it all hang out, literally.
[00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:40.370]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with hour number two.
[00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:43.370]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go over the Zuckerberg stuff.
[00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:45.370]  And one way or another, I'll have those documents.
[00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:54.370]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our
[00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:59.370]  extremely popular tooth whitening coral calcium toothpaste, full of essential

[00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:55.370]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've
[00:58:55.370 --> 00:59:01.370]  got our children drinking that. This is a psychotic death cult, period, case
[00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:06.370]  closed, out to get you and your family. We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by
[00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:10.370]  the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group. It's been around about 15 years, became
[00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:13.370]  the biggest company in the last six. They went out, hired engineers, reverse
[00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:17.370]  engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice
[00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:22.370]  the price, and they made it as good in all the studies. It reduces things to
[00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:25.370]  non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals. But you can go pay two or
[00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:28.370]  three times, there's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:32.370]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the
[00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:37.370]  price of the leading competitor. And the media says we're bad and a cult for
[00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:41.370]  telling you you should filter your water, you should also filter your shower
[00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:44.370]  water, that's another way you absorb this crap. But I'm done talking about that.
[00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:47.370]  The point is, you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com, they're discounted
[00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:50.370]  right now, finally back in stock.
[00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:58.370]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:21.370]  Alright, I usually get prepared for the show, but I've been on quasi-vacation,
[01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:25.370]  also working, come back tomorrow. And it's not the crew's fault, when I hit a
[01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:29.370]  frustration level, I gotta go off air until I find all the stuff I want,
[01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:35.370]  because I'm not gonna sit here and make claims on air to you without actually
[01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:39.370]  showing it to you. And this is part of the paradigm problem.
[01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:44.370]  About two weeks ago, it came out that Homeland Security and universities
[01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:48.370]  across the country is handing out millions and millions of dollars in grants
[01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:53.370]  to teach students that all conservatives are terrorists and white supremacists.
[01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:56.370]  You see it all over the news, you know about it. And if you look up there,
[01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:01.370]  you see Infowars is in the right-hand corner, right below the Nazis.
[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:05.370]  Alright, you got below that CBN, the Christian Broadcasting Network.
[01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:09.370]  Wow, they're Nazis, and Republican Party, and Fox News, and the American Flag,
[01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:13.370]  and the Heritage Foundation, and the NRA, and the John Birch Society.
[01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:17.370]  And so it's a whole article about that, that was on Infowars a few days ago.
[01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:23.370]  The frustration is, here's a week and a half before Infowars even wrote an article
[01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.370]  about how we were being attacked. And I'm not mad at the crew, it's the same thing
[01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:32.370]  with me. We had to update the website a few years ago, so everything four years
[01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:36.370]  older, older, got put in a thing like an archive. It's all messed up.
[01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:41.370]  And so Rob New was able to find our articles about us being listed as terrorists,
[01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:45.370]  and Facebook said that they could organize assaults on us.
[01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:52.770]  And we don't even focus on ourselves enough, the listeners aren't going to think we're important either.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.360]  I mean, if I could have my head blown off tomorrow, there probably wouldn't even be an article about it on InfoWars.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:07.360]  And I'm not mad, I'm just saying, we need to be focused on how serious and dangerous this is.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.360]  Were we able to find the article a few days ago when Simon wrote about it?
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.360]  I want people to be able to get this. I want to put it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.360]  There it is.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.360]  Biden DHS funding university programs claiming InfoWars is part of right-wing troops network.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.360]  It doesn't just say that, it says that we're terrorists, folks.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:27.360]  And I'm not mad at anybody. It's just that we don't realize the time we're in.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.360]  We don't realize how dangerous the hour is. We don't realize how far gone things are.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.360]  So, I'm just blowing up here, period.
[01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:44.470]  It's just, we're just used to being abused, is what it is.
[01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:47.630]  And that's what I was going to say when I came on, because I was listening to Owen in
[01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:51.910]  the first 30 minutes while I was getting ready, him saying, why don't we care?
[01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:52.990]  Why do they get away with it?
[01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:54.790]  Why is it getting worse?
[01:02:54.790 --> 01:03:00.070]  And it's because we've all gotten used to being abused, like a woman in a bad relationship
[01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:01.070]  or a man.
[01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:03.670]  There are a lot of relationships where women beat the men.
[01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:06.690]  And we just sit there and we take it, and we've had our will broken.
[01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:10.650]  And so, they traffic kids in front of us and ship fentanyl in, and they're destroying
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.210]  the dollar in front of us and launching World War III.
[01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:18.690]  No one's there to constrain the lunatics in their megalomaniacal power trip.
[01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:21.210]  And I'm mad at myself, just as much as I'm irritated.
[01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:28.250]  I mean, my family are great people and smart, but they don't even take any of this.
[01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:32.250]  I mean, they're just so used to the new world order and persecution, they just roll their eyes.
[01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.250]  And I guess that's a defense mechanism.
[01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:41.250]  You know, I guess it's a good thing that I've gotten comfortable with being hunted and attacked and lied about constantly.
[01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.250]  I guess it's a defense mechanism.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.600]  At least we're not like the left where nobody's persecuting them or doing anything to them,
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:55.600]  and they run around whining and bitching and saying they're victims of book banning and persecution.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.600]  No one's banning books. We're saying you can't give child porn to children.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.600]  Yeah, that's what they've got in the schools.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:13.600]  Genderqueer has graphic cartoons that are like real cartoon. It looks real of adults raping children.
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.600]  Tells children, try it out when the man wants to put you in his van.
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:21.600]  I mean, what the hell? They're handing manuals out to kids on how to get kidnapped and murdered.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.600]  I mean, and that's what they're doing. I didn't even air this last week.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.600]  And this week, it's my fault. We had a clip last week and one like on Monday. I never got to it.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:36.600]  I want both clips of men that have had their penises cut off, saying how painful it is and how horrible it is,
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.600]  because they don't just cut the penises off, folks.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.600]  They create a big, bleeding, rotting hole that almost always ends up killing people.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.600]  And then when they die from it, they say, well, we killed the transgenders.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.600]  So we weren't nice to them. But that's not half as bad.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.600]  The fake vagina is not as bad as the fake penises.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.600]  Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.600]  It will change your life. The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:14.600]  that upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.600]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.600]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.600]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:37.600]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.600]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.600]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.600]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful. You and your family need it.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:56.600]  It's 25% off back in stock. X3. Try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.600]  Take action now. But regardless, research is info.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:05.600]  I've got a tiger by the tail that's playing the scene.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.600]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.600]  He never gives up. He's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.600]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.600]  Just tuned in now to the second hour.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.600]  Owen Schroyer did a really great job last hour.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.600]  Detailing the hypocrisy, the corruption, the breakaway government we have.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.600]  The deep state is now out in the open.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.600]  Protecting all this criminal activity and Hunter Biden.
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.600]  Yeah, the child porn's terrible. Yeah, the crack cocaine's terrible.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.600]  Yeah, him with the trophy photos with his niece and nephews.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.600]  You know, with his penis hanging out with seven-year-old girls.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.600]  You know, he's wearing a robe. They're wearing robes.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.600]  I mean, it's all trophy photos he sends to his buddies.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.600]  That's criminal. It's horrible. He deserves to be in prison for the rest of his life.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:02.600]  You got Biden's daughter saying, yeah, I think my dad raped me in the shower.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.600]  And the people that have been abused, that's how it is.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.600]  They're like, I think I was raped. I don't want to say it. It's embarrassing.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.600]  But my daddy raped me. My daddy raped me.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.600]  But that's why they're compromised individuals the globalists put in power.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.600]  Because they can destroy them anytime they want to.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.600]  That's part of the course.
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:25.600]  When you see a group of Democrats up on a stage at a federal level, 80% of them rape children.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:31.120]  80% of them rape children, and I'd say 10% on the stage murder children.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.120]  That's very conservative.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.120]  And I stake my soul on that guesstimation.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.120]  I'm not saying that for hyperbole.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.120]  10% on the stage actually murder children and drink their blood.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.120]  And black magic rituals.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.120]  This is all coming out.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.120]  You've seen it.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.120]  UN reports.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.120]  It's coming out.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.120]  Whistleblowers everywhere.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.120]  I mean, it's just, they do black Sabbath rituals.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.120]  That's not just the name of a rock band.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.120]  Look what a black Sabbath ritual does.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.120]  You don't know all about it.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:08:01.120]  So maybe 10% of Republicans are pedophiles, and there's a lot of them as well.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.120]  But a lot of famous mobsters have gotten out of prison.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:10.120]  I saw one of them on Patrick and David's show just a few days ago.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:17.120]  And he said, you know, I had conservative values, but as a gangster who was doing illegal stuff, money laundering and things,
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.120]  I had to work with the Democrats because everybody knew they were the ones that were corrupt.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.120]  Republicans were almost never corrupt and would not do deals with us.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.120]  We'd threaten Republicans, try to squeeze them.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.120]  They'd say, well, okay, come on over to your house.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120]  We got guns too.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.120]  Now, that was Republicans 20, 30 years ago.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.120]  But that's how my family is.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.120]  We've had family in the past.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]  Have mafia trying to shake us down.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120]  Let's go.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.120]  Well, good.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.120]  Bring your guns.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.120]  And get ready for you to die too.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.120]  And don't think we won't come find your ass.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120]  You think you're the only one who knows how to pull a trigger around here, buddy boy?
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.120]  So you think you're the only one who knows how to kill people?
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.120]  The point is, is that we know how to kill people too.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.120]  But the issue is, we don't want to do that.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120]  We want to build a civilization.
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:05.120]  And so there's this big famous monster on there talking about the Democrats are the party of the corrupt.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120]  Okay.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.120]  That means Republicans aren't evil up at the top and globalists and all this.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:16.120]  But, I mean, when you finally realize that the Democrats are ultra evil folks, like as evil as you can be, they're the real gangsters.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.120]  They're the real criminals.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.120]  They're the real legion of doom.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.120]  The Italian mafia running scams on concrete and prostitutes.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.120]  I mean, that's like the Godfathers based on a composite of true stories.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120]  Frank Sinatra, all of it's in there.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120]  You know, the big crime family in New York.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.120]  Those are all real names, real people with the names changed.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.120]  And in it, the Don says, I'm not going to sell heroin to kids.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.120]  I'm not going to do that.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.120]  Because all these judges we've got in our pockets soon won't be there.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.120]  Well.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.220]  All those guys have been dead for 50, 60 years.
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:55.220]  The mafias they have today, ladies and gentlemen, are running the most horrible stuff.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.220]  Snuff films, fentanyl, you see what's going on.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.220]  But they're not running the show.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:03.220]  The big hospital companies are running the shows.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:09.220]  They're the ones that killed hundreds of thousands of people with ventilators worldwide under UN control.
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.220]  That's the real organized crime.
[01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:13.870]  That's the real organized crime.
[01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:15.870]  And
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.060]  That's where all of this is going.
[01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:25.520]  So we are a fallen, collapsed, corrupt system, and everybody obsesses
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.760]  over the Hunter Biden child porn.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:32.320]  But what about the audio and the text messages where he says, I'm under the
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.780]  command with my dad of the head of Chinese intelligence, this is four years ago.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:45.099]  And he's disappeared, I haven't gotten orders in several months, and he's worth $48 million,
[01:10:45.099 --> 01:10:49.179]  whatever number, something that was bigger than that. And, you know, I've been getting paid by him
[01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:54.780]  and I'm scared, what do I do? So he's sending audio files out to his people, including his dad,
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:00.700]  who'd been the vice president at that point, saying, where's my handler? Because, you know,
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.219]  Biden sends his son out as the bag man to get the hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:11:05.099 --> 01:11:09.820]  So this crackhead under the head of Chinese intelligence directly handles him.
[01:11:11.019 --> 01:11:15.019]  And he's on the audio tapes that he sends out to people because he thinks he's invincible.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:23.580]  He's a Chinese spy, ladies and gentlemen. He's a Chinese spy. He's a communist Chinese spy.
[01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:33.630]  I mean, just let that sink into your brain for a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:38.810]  And then you see the congressional hearings, they're talking about myself and Owen Schroer
[01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:45.830]  and people saying we're terrorists and we need to be put in jail and all this crap.
[01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:46.830]  It's all a giant fraud.
[01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:50.110]  So this is what happens in civilization.
[01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:56.910]  You get to a corrupt point where everybody just says yes to the tyrants and then the
[01:11:56.910 --> 01:12:01.630]  tyrants get out of their mind and then everything collapses and then civilization slowly comes
[01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:02.630]  back.
[01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:03.630]  But this time we've got nuclear weapons.
[01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.110]  This time we've got biological weapons.
[01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:09.430]  Now it's come out that they lied, of course they did last year, but there's no bio labs
[01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:10.430]  in Ukraine.
[01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:11.430]  There's no bio labs.
[01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:17.070]  Turns out there are super weapon bio labs with stuff thousands of times worse than COVID.
[01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:21.070]  When I say thousands, I mean, COVID was novel, weird.
[01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.150]  If you didn't get treatment, it could kill you.
[01:12:23.150 --> 01:12:26.230]  It was a new virus, but they made it to create a vaccine for it.
[01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:27.790]  That was the whole point.
[01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:33.630]  They've got stuff that kills 50 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent.
[01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:37.830]  And they admit at these labs that the U.S. government runs.
[01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:40.670]  Why would anyone in the U.S. government want to work there?
[01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:42.810]  Why would you be part of something illegal?
[01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:43.810]  Why would you do this?
[01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:45.050]  Well, they're going to find people who will do it.
[01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:50.050]  And even with the congressional hearings happening and it's all coming out, they're still doing it.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:57.300]  And of course, Russia claimed that last year, this year, we played it a month ago.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.660]  They have press conferences going, yeah, we do have those labs.
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.660]  Yeah, we do have gain of function.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:05.860]  Yeah, we do have stuff that'll kill the majority of people come in contact with it.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:09.900]  I mean, because you're lunatics.
[01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:14.060]  But Biden said just last week, the number one threat is white supremacists.
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:18.020]  And he defines white supremacists as anybody who's right of Mao Zedong.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:23.060]  There's no limit.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.060]  I mean, the ADL says that Elon Musk is anti-Semitic.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:28.060]  What?
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.060]  The ADL says Donald Trump's anti-Semitic.
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.060]  The ADL says Tucker Carlson's anti-Semitic.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.060]  I mean, it's obscene.
[01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.060]  It's absurd.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:41.060]  But that's where this is going, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:44.060]  And then the idea is, well, you're going to be arrested if you're anti-Semitic.
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.060]  No, people have a right to be anti-Semitic.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.060]  And here's the issue.
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:51.060]  It's going to make people aren't sophisticated anti-Semitic
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.060]  when you brand all this tyranny, all this surveillance, all this censorship,
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:58.060]  all this craziness, all Black Lives Matter, burning down cities, arresting patriots,
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:02.060]  when you brand it as the ADL runs it.
[01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.210]  And they have the State Department.
[01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.210]  Thank you ADL for developing the plan
[01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:10.210]  for the intelligence agencies to take on the white people.
[01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:12.210]  And white people are inherently evil
[01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:14.210]  and white people are inherently bad.
[01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:16.210]  We're going to skip this network break.
[01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:18.210]  I'm going to be going shorter in here
[01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:20.210]  and I kind of spun out earlier getting mad.
[01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:22.210]  And I don't want to say it's PTSD.
[01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:24.210]  It is not.
[01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:26.210]  But it is frustration
[01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:28.210]  when I start remembering that Facebook,
[01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:30.210]  the biggest media organization in the world,
[01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:32.210]  three and a half, four years ago,
[01:14:32.210 --> 01:14:34.210]  did a next level ban saying
[01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:36.210]  you're not allowed to say nice things about him.
[01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:39.210]  You are allowed to call for violence against him
[01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:41.210]  and organize violence.
[01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:42.210]  And they did find the documents.
[01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:43.210]  We'll show it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.210]  Rob Dewey came in like 15 minutes ago
[01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:46.210]  and told me he gave it to you guys.
[01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:48.210]  Should we put that on screen please?
[01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:52.210]  So that's what's going on here.
[01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:54.210]  That's what's happening.
[01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:56.210]  And we're going to show some news articles about it
[01:14:56.210 --> 01:14:58.210]  because I know we wrote articles about it.
[01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:00.210]  I know it was all over the news at the time.
[01:15:00.210 --> 01:15:02.210]  And you know what?
[01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:06.250]  If we can't find the articles or something happened to him, even though it was a number
[01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:09.490]  one national story, it just shows how we don't write about ourselves.
[01:15:09.490 --> 01:15:12.090]  I understand it's there.
[01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:15.250]  New Facebook policy allows violence against conservatives.
[01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:16.250]  Yes.
[01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:17.250]  Yes.
[01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.250]  Thank you.
[01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:19.250]  Bingo.
[01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.250]  Let's update it.
[01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:21.250]  Let's repost it on the front page.
[01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.570]  And let's make a big deal about this, because understand, this isn't the past.
[01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:24.650]  This is the future.
[01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.730]  This is what they're trying to do.
[01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:29.570]  This is what they failed to do a few years ago.
[01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:32.170]  July 19th, 2019.
[01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:37.170]  So four years ago, a little under four years ago, great job crew.
[01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:38.170]  So I'm just, I'm upset.
[01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:39.770]  And you know, we need to be upset.
[01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:42.850]  We need to be pissed off because I'm not threatened by this.
[01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:45.890]  I'm not threatened by them saying they're going to organize violence against me.
[01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:52.910]  Because it's so easy to just let all this go to hell.
[01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:58.910]  I mean, really, the people trying to start the Civil War really should be scared of themselves.
[01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:05.910]  Because if you dumbasses that run the New World Order think because you live in some armored compound in Kauai
[01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:12.910]  with some stupid robots with heavy machine guns, because you don't trust your own security people, you're a fool.
[01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:16.910]  Everyone hates you. Everyone's talking about you. Everyone knows everything about you.
[01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:19.910]  Everyone's watching you and just waiting for everything to go to hell.
[01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:24.910]  And then the first thing that's going to happen when society collapses is these billionaires that everyone's watching,
[01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:27.910]  everyone hates, everyone's got your number.
[01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:30.910]  Why do you think Elon Musk is, I love the people, I'm anti-New World Order,
[01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:35.910]  whoo, I'm going to reform things, yeah, let's get our pitchforks, because he ain't stupid.
[01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:41.910]  And he's getting prepositioned to survive this, you dumb sons of garbage.
[01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:43.910]  Like Zuckerberg and the rest of you.
[01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:46.910]  Do you people really think you're going to destroy civilization,
[01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:51.910]  and then the civilization that's allowed you to be safe and secure is going to then not eat your ass?
[01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:54.910]  I mean, seriously, you dumb bastards.
[01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.910]  Why would you destroy the safety net? Why would you destroy chivalry?
[01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.910]  Why would you destroy the checks and balances?
[01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:03.910]  Why would you set up out-of-control intelligence agencies that can get away with anything they want?
[01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:09.910]  Because you're a committee of lawyers and pussies that sit around convincing yourselves you can control something,
[01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:12.910]  because you're different than everybody else that came before you.
[01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:16.910]  You cannot control the ring of Mordor, you dumb bastards.
[01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:20.910]  You don't have the ring, Satan has the ring, as a metaphor.
[01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:26.910]  And when you put on the lesser rings, I want to come out of break with the intro to Lord of the Rings, please.
[01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:30.910]  It started right after, with the start of the movie.
[01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:32.910]  It's only about two minutes long.
[01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:36.910]  And I just want you guys to understand, it's the perfect allegory, and Tolkien explained it as the allegory,
[01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:38.910]  of thinking it justifies the means.
[01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:41.910]  Oh, I'm just going to be evil this one time to win.
[01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:45.910]  You have any idea, folks, if I wanted to be evil, what I could do?
[01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:49.910]  I mean, I could really, I could probably beat these people, just myself.
[01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:52.910]  With the platform we've got, and that's why they're so scared.
[01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:55.910]  They know, if I did the tactics they did, and I started, I mean,
[01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:58.910]  it's devastating.
[01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:00.910]  But it would all be turned to evil.
[01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.910]  And it would all make things worse.
[01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:04.910]  So I don't use evil, not consciously.
[01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:06.910]  I slip up sometimes.
[01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:08.910]  And I've done some evil things, not meaning to.
[01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:10.910]  And I've seen horrible repercussions.
[01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.910]  It's done horrible things to the enemy.
[01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:16.910]  And then I watch it like, in Star Wars, where the trash compactor,
[01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:19.910]  and it's magnetically sealed, Luke Skywalker, you know,
[01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:23.910]  or Han Solo shoots the laser, and it's bounced around for an hour.
[01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:26.910]  I mean, that's what evil, that's what black magic is.
[01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:29.910]  Black magic isn't just sitting around a cauldron with witches and doing chants.
[01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:31.910]  It's doing nasty things.
[01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:33.910]  It's the knowledge of evil.
[01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.910]  It's manipulating the matrix.
[01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:37.910]  But it always bounces around.
[01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:41.910]  So you pull the trigger, and it goes forever, basically.
[01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:43.910]  It doesn't go away.
[01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:46.910]  And these people are polluting the world with dark energy
[01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:48.910]  and with these manipulations.
[01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:50.910]  And so that's why we're here.
[01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:54.910]  The establishment just keeps hoping some new technological breakthrough
[01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:56.910]  or some new control system comes in,
[01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:59.910]  and that they'll be able to convince us and dominate us and control us.
[01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:03.910]  And they just dumb us down enough and poison us enough and confuse us enough
[01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:05.910]  that we'll forget they did all this.
[01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:10.910]  And then really all they're doing is creating a giant army of psychotics.
[01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:14.910]  I mean, this is not a good situation, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:17.910]  So I'll get into the Zuckerberg stuff.
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:23.480]  And I already pretty much got into a lot of it, but it's just mind blowing.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:30.519]  But I really think with the debt ceiling agreement that was just made and the FBI director to
[01:19:30.519 --> 01:19:36.440]  be in contempt of Congress, I mean, if they can put Steve Bannon in jail for contempt
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.480]  of Congress, they should be able to put the FBI director, GOP rep declares constitutional
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.360]  crisis over FBI Director Wray defying congressional speed.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:50.599]  So they told me that if I defy the congressional subpoenas or refuse to testify, they were
[01:19:50.599 --> 01:19:51.599]  going to put me in jail.
[01:19:51.599 --> 01:19:55.719]  So I wouldn't use the fifth on their ass, didn't mean anything wrong, it's like, this
[01:19:55.719 --> 01:20:03.559]  is an illegitimate, this is an illegitimate operation, and I am not part of it.
[01:20:03.559 --> 01:20:07.599]  And I'm not going to, and they said, why won't you be part of it, I said, because Schiff
[01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:12.719]  has been caught three times in this committee falsifying documents, all the transcripts.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.799]  There's a bunch of congressmen and lawyers, and a bunch of them could help, they nodded.
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:23.320]  I mean, they know, I mean, I'm like, you really want me to be put in jail?
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:27.160]  Because anything I do, you're going to say is a lie, you dumb bastards.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:31.799]  I mean, seriously, you think screwing me out of my rights is going to make you safe, you
[01:20:31.799 --> 01:20:32.920]  dumb asses?
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.759]  I know I'm ranting, Owen Schroeder, it just really gets me upset.
[01:20:39.719 --> 01:20:43.240]  Do you think I answered the question you were asking last hour?
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:49.200]  Yeah, I think, though, we have to find the right pressure points, Alex, it's kind of
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.360]  like, you know, the smallest guy in the room with the right knowledge can win a fight,
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.200]  like, you know, Bruce Lee, like, oh, he's not going to beat up that big tough guy, six
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.679]  foot six hulking man with huge arms and legs.
[01:20:59.839 --> 01:21:01.879]  And then he gets in there and he's got the most power.
[01:21:01.879 --> 01:21:02.879]  He knows the pressure point.
[01:21:02.879 --> 01:21:08.440]  So it's like, where can we apply the pressure as the American people to maybe try to
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.040]  institute a change? Because is it is it to apply pressure to Kevin McCarthy?
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.559]  Like, do we I'm not saying Kevin McCarthy is the be all end all.
[01:21:15.559 --> 01:21:18.120]  To me, he's receiving a failing grade as the speaker of the house.
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.040]  But it's like, is that the pressure point?
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.719]  Like, is that like if you come and you boom, you hit right on that neck, like your right
[01:21:23.719 --> 01:21:25.280]  side goes numb. You're out.
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.639]  Right. It's like, where are the pressure points?
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.839]  Do we say, hey, Kevin McCarthy, every day, Kevin McCarthy, what are you doing?
[01:21:30.839 --> 01:21:34.639]  What are you doing? Until finally he's like, well, gee, I better do something here.
[01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.120]  I'm batting zero for the team.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.719]  I'm going to lose my spot if I don't at least get a base hit and get on base.
[01:21:39.879 --> 01:21:43.759]  And then maybe that starts the dominoes, because, I mean, this is just ridiculous at this
[01:21:43.759 --> 01:21:46.160]  point. The American people know the FBI is corrupt.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.040]  At least half of Congress knows the FBI is corrupt.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.160]  And it's just like, do we have no leverage at all?
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.040]  Are our hands completely gone?
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.799]  Are our legs completely cut off?
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.799]  I think we just don't know.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.639]  We just don't know our abilities.
[01:21:59.639 --> 01:22:02.200]  We need to relearn the martial arts of politics.
[01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:04.719]  I mean, I agree with that.
[01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:11.440]  And look, I'm going for contempt of Congress on the FBI director.
[01:22:11.759 --> 01:22:16.679]  This is a appointed individual approved by Congress, so they have the right to remove his
[01:22:16.679 --> 01:22:20.839]  ass. And of course, you have Mitch McConnell, all the Republicans defending him.
[01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:27.200]  And Trump even idiotically was defending putting this director in years ago.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.679]  But it's just it's all a disaster.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.280]  And it's just bad at every level.
[01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:36.599]  It's bad at every single level.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.440]  But at the same time, people like Director Wray, he's just a lawyer.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:44.040]  He's just emblematic of somebody doing what he's told.
[01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:47.360]  They obviously know they've destroyed their careers, destroyed their names.
[01:22:47.839 --> 01:22:52.360]  But now they're thinking, and that's the other big thing I want to say, how do we make
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.639]  ourselves the heroes again?
[01:22:53.639 --> 01:22:56.920]  And the answer is they're going to attack the power grid and say we did it.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.360]  And you can say, well, the public will see through that.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:06.280]  I don't know. And I'm not trying to do the enemy's thinking for them, but public's so
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.839]  lazy and spoiled on many levels, they'll just want their computer turned back on.
[01:23:09.839 --> 01:23:11.200]  They'll want their power turned back on.
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.839]  And so a lot of people will go along with it.
[01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:19.639]  I mean, of course, it'll have horrible repercussions and three or four steps down the
[01:23:19.639 --> 01:23:20.920]  road, make it worse for the globalists.
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.440]  But see, they don't care.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.440]  They always just one step ahead to stay in power, even though it makes it worse a few
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:30.360]  steps down for them. Then they think they'll have some new scam that gets them over the
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.320]  next hurdle. And you can see it's insurmountable.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:36.000]  It's insane. And that's my real frustration is when I look at the globalists and their
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.679]  minions, we're all in the same sinking ship together and there aren't lifeboats.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.440]  And they want to fight with me.
[01:23:41.719 --> 01:23:43.440]  And I'm just like, you people are crazy.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.559]  I mean, I don't even want to fight with you dumbasses.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:50.080]  I'm just so sick of how stupid you are and how moronic you are.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:55.440]  This country was the wealthiest and the safest and the freest and the most dynamic
[01:23:55.799 --> 01:23:58.960]  because we did more than any other nation empower the individual and have checks and
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.639]  balances. We were far from perfect and a lot of bad episodes, but we've been course
[01:24:02.639 --> 01:24:06.080]  correcting and doing incredible things, unlike any other nation the world's ever seen.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.559]  And so and now we've gone the polar opposite of what made us great.
[01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:17.040]  A 180. And then we ask ourselves.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.960]  You know why that is, and it's because we've become lazy and become stupid and we act
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:28.799]  yes and say yes, all the yes men that say yes, the yes men, the yes men at the top, it's
[01:24:28.799 --> 01:24:34.080]  the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and the British Sachs-Coburg Gothas that aren't even
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.440]  British and aren't even German or like literally Transylvanian from a Count Dracula line.
[01:24:38.559 --> 01:24:39.759]  Can't make this up.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:42.519]  And they're completely inbred pedophiles on record.
[01:24:42.839 --> 01:24:45.000]  And they don't know what planet they're on anymore.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.240]  And we're all just receiving orders from these people.
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.879]  And George Soros is running around generaling and they're just all psychotic out of their
[01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:55.480]  minds. It's like, what the hell is going on here?
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:59.160]  And then now the ADL says all white people are bad.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.080]  Now, they're backing all the leftist groups.
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.360]  And if you say, hey, whites, it's OK to be white.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360]  No, you're evil.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.759]  We need to put you in jail.
[01:25:06.759 --> 01:25:08.440]  They're saying we want to put you in jail.
[01:25:08.599 --> 01:25:11.320]  Don't you dumbasses realize that'll cause a real war?
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.920]  They're like, yeah, we'll get a lot of funding then when the new world order tanks, you
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.400]  know, have the ADL on the side.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:23.360]  And I mean, folks, the tanks coming to the American people, the globalists are going to
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.719]  put the Star of David on it, basically, because they think, well, no one will oppose this.
[01:25:27.879 --> 01:25:29.960]  And then literally people are going to oppose it.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.960]  And then you're going to make it about the Jews.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.040]  And it's not about the Jews.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.679]  The Jews are being set up here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:35.799 --> 01:25:41.440]  And a two year old, anyone that can rub two frickin brain cells together should know you
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.679]  don't want. I mean, I mean, if Biden was doing all this evil crap and they put a cross on
[01:25:46.679 --> 01:25:49.639]  the side of the tank, I'd say, take that off, take that off, take that off.
[01:25:50.559 --> 01:25:51.799]  Take that cross off there.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.400]  You're not, you don't represent us.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.360]  I mean, they had a Christian organization and the government's like, thank you for running
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.879]  us. Thank you for telling us what to do, Christian organization.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.759]  And we're going to arrest people and surveil them and take everything away from them.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.440]  Thank you, Christians.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.480]  I'd be like, hey, you don't represent me.
[01:26:07.799 --> 01:26:11.839]  I'm not with you. Let me just stop here before I come back into the Zuckerberg and all the
[01:26:11.839 --> 01:26:13.320]  rest of it. But the point is.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.759]  We're in the season of false flags, they're planting false flags, that's how they intend
[01:26:17.759 --> 01:26:18.839]  to go the rest of the way here.
[01:26:18.839 --> 01:26:20.000]  It's obviously not going to work.
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.160]  A large portion of the public's totally awake.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.559]  We're waking up every day.
[01:26:23.719 --> 01:26:25.719]  This is an explosive situation.
[01:26:25.879 --> 01:26:27.799]  But separately, I get so busy, I don't do this.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.599]  InfoWars needs to expand, not contract.
[01:26:31.879 --> 01:26:34.480]  And if we don't get funding, we will implode.
[01:26:34.759 --> 01:26:37.879]  InfoWars is barely in the black, but that's not the reason to support us.
[01:26:38.679 --> 01:26:39.960]  These are great products you need.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.240]  You want to experience ultimate fish oil, ultimate grill oil.

[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280]  Here's the most important point.
[01:27:02.639 --> 01:27:07.639]  TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, sold out for six, seven months, finally back at
[01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:08.879]  stock. We've got a limited supply.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.120]  It will be sold out at current sales rates in about three weeks.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.799]  So next Tuesday at midnight, it's going to go back to full price.

[01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:23.799]  acids and more. Discounted right now.
[01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:29.200]  InfoWarsStore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:27:29.519 --> 01:27:30.719]  I thank you all for your support.
[01:27:30.719 --> 01:27:34.960]  These are great products. Also going back to regular prices, the ultimate fish oil,
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.920]  ultimate grill oil, and a bunch of other products because they're getting close to
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:42.240]  selling out. Some of the other products that have been sold out are about to be back
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.400]  in as well, but that's kind of, we don't have enough funds to get all our products
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.440]  because we have limited stuff to try to sell that and then kind of put the money
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.559]  towards expanding our inventory back up.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.200]  And very soon, hopefully we'll have the inventory back to close to 100% and then
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.440]  we'll be able to really rehire some folks, hire some new people, launch even more
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.799]  shows and go to the next level.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.320]  But we're right at that make it or break it point.
[01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:06.360]  So I thank you all for the seed money, your support, but you really need these
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.799]  products. And finally, I almost forgot, Survival Shield X3, the most important
[01:28:10.799 --> 01:28:14.559]  thing, the tri-iodine, the deep crystal iodine and two other types that help in
[01:28:14.559 --> 01:28:17.959]  its full absorption, because a small percentage of people can't absorb pure
[01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:21.360]  iodine. Most people can not absorb bound iodine.
[01:28:21.599 --> 01:28:23.519]  That's why this is three different of the best types.
[01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:29.120]  Tri-iodine, Infowarsstore.com, it is 25% off, but that sale is going to end on
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.400]  Tuesday as well because we've got a limited supply.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.879]  It's about to be sold out again.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.240]  Last time again, it was sold out again for over six months.
[01:28:35.719 --> 01:28:38.040]  Well, hopefully it'll only be sold out for a few months this time.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:43.679]  But if you want your Tri-Iodine X3, it's available now at Infowarsstore.com or
[01:28:43.679 --> 01:28:49.719]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.920]  All right. Absolutely jam-packed transmission.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.719]  We have a huge special guest I haven't told you about, former high-level
[01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:56.080]  psychological warfare expert in the U.S.
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.719]  Army to break down the latest developments worldwide.
[01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:01.040]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:29:01.519 --> 01:29:03.719]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:29:03.759 --> 01:29:05.360]  It will change your life.
[01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:09.799]  The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two
[01:29:09.799 --> 01:29:14.599]  million people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:19.480]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:29:19.879 --> 01:29:23.759]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements, so
[01:29:23.759 --> 01:29:25.040]  your body can't absorb it.
[01:29:25.519 --> 01:29:29.759]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:34.440]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually
[01:29:34.719 --> 01:29:37.000]  has this type of full effect.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.280]  It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock.
[01:29:43.719 --> 01:29:45.639]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.080]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:49.480]  You and your family need it.
[01:29:49.679 --> 01:29:51.400]  It's 25 percent off, back in stock.
[01:29:51.759 --> 01:29:55.840]  X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.679]  But regardless, research is info.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:04.120]  Sold out for more than a year, we now have back in stock a limited run of our
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.000]  extremely popular tooth whitening coral calcium toothpaste, full of essential
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.160]  oils, back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:16.120]  Another great product, sold out for almost a year, is our activated charcoal
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.480]  essential oil toothpaste as well.
[01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:22.360]  These are both incredible for your gums, polish your teeth, amazing to
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.759]  counter gingivitis, and they fund the Infowar.
[01:30:24.959 --> 01:30:27.000]  There are no fillers in these products.
[01:30:27.519 --> 01:30:32.200]  These are fluoride free, next level toothpaste, 10,000 of each tube,
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:36.400]  limited run, available exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:36.759 --> 01:30:39.160]  And your purchase funds the operation.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.120]  Plus, these are incredible products you need.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.799]  So the coral calcium tooth whitening and the activated charcoal essential oil
[01:30:44.799 --> 01:30:49.360]  toothpaste are now both back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:49.559 --> 01:30:50.799]  I thank you for your support.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:53.000]  But regardless, these are great products you need.
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.320]  So take action now.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:58.000]  Go to Infowarsstore.com for both this great toothpaste, back in stock.
[01:30:58.959 --> 01:31:02.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.440]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words,
[01:31:05.679 --> 01:31:07.200]  plan for our future.
[01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.200]  That is a hellish future.
[01:31:08.639 --> 01:31:11.559]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to
[01:31:11.559 --> 01:31:14.599]  ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for
[01:31:14.599 --> 01:31:17.679]  the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:21.639]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the
[01:31:21.639 --> 01:31:23.599]  signed copies we got run out.
[01:31:23.639 --> 01:31:25.759]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:30.440]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy
[01:31:30.599 --> 01:31:31.599]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:31.799 --> 01:31:35.519]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:31:35.719 --> 01:31:38.759]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:31:38.799 --> 01:31:41.360]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:31:41.639 --> 01:31:44.639]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or
[01:31:44.639 --> 01:31:45.639]  unsigned copies.
[01:31:45.639 --> 01:31:49.879]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.320]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:55.759]  library or give them to the local school.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:58.639]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:31:58.719 --> 01:32:02.639]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels
[01:32:02.719 --> 01:32:06.160]  and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.080]  hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.280]  And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.120]  Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah?
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.000]  Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.080]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.799]  I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.080]  And again, you know, I have Infowars to thank for that.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:26.040]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:32:26.559 --> 01:32:30.679]  I was so grateful because, you know, I truly was classically trained under Alex
[01:32:30.679 --> 01:32:32.360]  Jones and under the Infowars team.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.000]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.599]  clips, because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go
[01:32:41.599 --> 01:32:43.719]  where the mainstream media refuses to.
[01:32:43.959 --> 01:32:46.160]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.400]  I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[01:32:49.599 --> 01:32:53.040]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.160]  me early on in my career.
[01:33:00.559 --> 01:33:06.799]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.719]  The world has changed.
[01:33:16.719 --> 01:33:19.879]  And I feel it in the water.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.519]  I feel it in the earth.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.240]  I smell it in the air.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.719]  Much that once was is lost.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.440]  For none now live who remember it.
[01:33:47.719 --> 01:33:50.840]  It began with the forging of the great rings.
[01:33:51.879 --> 01:33:57.240]  Three were given to the elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:05.000]  Seven to the dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.959]  And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of men who above all else desire
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.080]  who above all else desire power.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:23.519]  For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
[01:34:25.759 --> 01:34:32.959]  But they were all of them deceived for another ring was made in the land of
[01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:35.799]  Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:43.320]  The Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring to control all others and
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:49.879]  into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.360]  One ring to rule them all.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:02.080]  One by one, the free lands of Middle-earth fall to the power of the sun.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.200]  So that's the point we're at right now in the allegory.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:04.719]  That's good.
[01:35:04.719 --> 01:35:07.080]  I want to go back to Alex Flutter here on the Alex Jones show.
[01:35:07.959 --> 01:35:09.879]  We have a special guest I'll tell you about in a moment, but.
[01:35:11.170 --> 01:35:27.170]  That's what the global government is, that's what the cashless society is, that's what the market of the beast is, that's what the beast system is, it's one computer system where if you don't do exactly what they say and behave the way they tell you to behave, there's always new demands, always new things you got to do.
[01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:32.170]  Oh, did you sterilize yourself? Did you sterilize your children? You don't get bug protein this month.
[01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:43.170]  Oh, you're allowed to live another year and then you're going to be euthanized. This is already being rolled out, it's already being proposed, it's already being done in places like Canada.
[01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:58.170]  They're already keeping babies alive, they're not just killing babies up to birth, they keep them alive for up to two weeks while they get the organ harvesting lined up to get the highest price and the blood types matched.
[01:35:58.170 --> 01:36:11.170]  Remember the governor of Virginia like five years ago said, well, we don't involve the police, we just get there with the mama and we said, we're not going to resuscitate the baby and maybe baby live, maybe baby die.
[01:36:11.170 --> 01:36:21.170]  And resuscitate is not the term they mean when they say like you've had a heart attack and they resuscitate you with defibrillators or whatever, mouth to mouth.
[01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:33.170]  This is a term for, do we say it's a human that's going to live or do we say this baby isn't a person but they keep it alive before they harvest the organs.
[01:36:33.170 --> 01:36:39.170]  So this is all, we're way down the rattle. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I said I'd play this earlier, we're going to do it now.
[01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:42.170]  So I've been trying to get to this for a week and a half.
[01:36:43.170 --> 01:36:54.170]  The first clip is a group of men who got convinced to hate themselves by psychologists and by the schools and systems to have their genitals cut off.
[01:36:54.170 --> 01:37:01.170]  But they don't just like eunuchs cut the testicles off or even cut the penis off because then the penis heals over.
[01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:06.170]  It's still very painful reportedly, but you've just got a hole there and then you pee out of it.
[01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:09.170]  I'm sorry to get graphic, we're going to go over this.
[01:37:09.170 --> 01:37:12.170]  And by the way, you can go online, the surgeries are public.
[01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:17.170]  There's breast surgeries, there's face surgeries, there's heart surgery.
[01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:19.170]  Any surgery you want to see, just type it in.
[01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:24.170]  If you type in the actual name of these, it's like penoplasty, there's a bunch of them.
[01:37:24.170 --> 01:37:28.170]  They will show it.
[01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:32.170]  And I don't recommend you look at it, but if you want to see the full horror,
[01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:35.170]  they tell them it's going to be great, you won't be depressed anymore, do this.
[01:37:35.170 --> 01:37:41.170]  It's happening to as young as seven-year-olds in the U.S., as young as five in the U.K., as young as five in Germany.
[01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:43.170]  They say the child can make the decision.
[01:37:43.170 --> 01:37:46.170]  Of course, they can't buy liquor or join the military, but now they can.
[01:37:46.170 --> 01:37:49.170]  They've been convinced by their psychotic parents in the state.
[01:37:49.170 --> 01:37:56.170]  And now they're passing laws to take people's children away from the parents if they don't go along with it.
[01:37:56.170 --> 01:38:05.170]  And they go in and they fillet, they fillet the penis, and then they cut open into the body,
[01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:08.170]  and they suture in the penis.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:21.740]  Penis material into the sides of just muscles between your legs and then they staple in
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:23.300]  what's left of the urethra.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:26.340]  back in the channel.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.340]  So there's no muscles to dilate.
[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:30.340]  There's no nerves.
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:32.340]  It's not natural.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:34.340]  And it always becomes infected.
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:36.340]  It always becomes hellish.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.340]  For the rest of their lives,
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.340]  they have to wear a big,
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:42.340]  hollow prosthesis
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.340]  that, quote,
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.340]  keeps the artificial vagina open.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.340]  A lot of times,
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:50.340]  it gets maggots in it.
[01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:52.340]  I'm not joking, folks.
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:54.340]  And that's when people commit suicide.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:56.340]  Then when they commit suicide, they say,
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.340]  oh, you didn't embrace it, how beautiful it is.
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:00.340]  Now, it gets worse.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.340]  With women,
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:04.340]  they cut their forearms off
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:06.340]  and muscles out of the front of their legs
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:08.340]  because these doctors are all Hellraiser types,
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.340]  so they really get off on it.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:12.340]  There's photos and videos of it.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:14.340]  We're not going to show you.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:16.340]  And they create, usually,
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.340]  10-to-1-foot-long giant penises
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.340]  because they love to cut more meat off the arms.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:22.340]  Cut the forearms off,
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:24.340]  cut the muscles out,
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:26.340]  cut the thighs out.
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.340]  So now they're like these psycho-looking creatures
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:30.340]  that are mutilated.
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.340]  People that are assault-harming love it.
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:34.340]  It's the next level.
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.340]  And then they sew it all together
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:38.340]  and put a tube in it,
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.340]  a catheter,
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.340]  up into your body.
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:47.380]  And they then create a giant fake penis that look it up.
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.260]  Usually within six months,
[01:39:53.260 --> 01:39:55.460]  people freak out and say, cut it off, remove.
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:58.300]  But they say, oh no, you're depressed.
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.140]  You go forward with it.
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:02.500]  And then a lot of times it just rots off and falls off.
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:05.300]  And I think the record is like four years
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:08.460]  one of these things lasted, okay?
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:11.780]  But it was a giant rotting piece of meat.
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:14.980]  Now, let me describe this for you, okay?
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:19.020]  I, nine years ago was in Big Bend,
[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:21.940]  hiked too late in the evening, too late in the day,
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:23.980]  was hiking back in the dark
[01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:27.620]  and got up to the side of the road near the lodge.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:29.500]  And they had just pulled a telephone pole out
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:31.700]  I later learned to put a new one in,
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:36.700]  but didn't cover the telephone pole hole.
[01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.540]  And I stepped three feet into it and blew
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:41.200]  at the time, 60% of my Achilles.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:42.400]  I went in and they said,
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.400]  well, you'll be off in a few months.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.360]  We can staple it right now.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.440]  You need to do it or it's gonna go bad.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.280]  I said, I'm in the middle of a divorce.
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:51.160]  I got stuff to do.
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.880]  I am not, I'm just gonna ignore this.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:54.920]  In fact, that was a week later.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.320]  I still decided to stay in Big Bend
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:01.040]  and hike up 5,000 feet on a mountain
[01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.280]  the next day after I blew it.
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.560]  That's the type of dumb ass I am.
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.000]  I should have gone back to Austin, got it fixed immediately.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.240]  Now it's necrosed and there's a big ball up on my calf
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.880]  and it's only about 10% left.
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:12.880]  I can't use my leg as a crutch.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.320]  I can still run on it if I need to,
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.200]  but it's gonna go out at any time.
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.360]  I've been to four different top surgeons
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.000]  in Houston, Austin, and Dallas.
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.640]  And they said, we're gonna have to take a tendon
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:25.160]  out of your big toe because you got two there.
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:26.360]  We're gonna have to do a bunch of stuff.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.520]  Probably the best thing is a cadaver out of China.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.840]  I'm not doing that.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.160]  Well, you have no, you have nothing there.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.960]  So there's a good chance that we build it back up
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.380]  and take maybe muscle out of your thigh or your buttocks.
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:40.800]  If you keep all of it for seven weeks and don't move it,
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:43.980]  you've got about an 80% chance in rehab
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:47.380]  that it'll ever work as good as even close.
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:51.620]  So top doctors are telling me, we can't fix your leg now
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:54.780]  because you didn't get it fixed when you should have, okay?
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.620]  All right?
[01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:00.500]  And that's what, oh, but we can make you a fake vagina
[01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:01.940]  or a fake penis, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:03.460]  So real doctors will tell me,
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:09.380]  yeah, if we take muscle out of a, well, you know,
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:12.380]  out of you and we put a cadaver tendon in there
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:14.740]  and strengthen it with one of the tendons in your,
[01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:18.980]  that goes to your big toe, seven weeks in a cast
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:21.460]  and then three months of rehab,
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.420]  you're gonna have to sign forms that it may fail
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:24.300]  and you'll have to have another surgery
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.140]  and it may never work.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.940]  But, you know, I had three doctors telling me this.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.800]  I went to other ones before,
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.640]  and they said, you're inoperable, inoperable.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.480]  But man, you're a little kid.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:39.520]  Woo, brother, we gonna cut that penis off right now.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.240]  Take care of you.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.480]  We're gonna make a big rotting hole in the side
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.880]  of your body that the maggots are gonna love.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.520]  And we're gonna have the whole media attack everybody.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.600]  We'll pull up the pressure if you don't go along with it.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.440]  That's what they've set up.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.560]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.880]  I'll tell you about the special guest straight ahead.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:56.280]  I went shorty riding shotgun.
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:01.160]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King Show,
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:03.880]  joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of the Reiss Report.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:06.040]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.520]  to infowarsstore.com.

[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:14.680]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality,
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.120]  or what Greg has.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:17.360]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.280]  If you really wanna treat yourself to something nice,
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.800]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:25.340]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it,
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:26.340]  wherever you want it.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.460]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:30.960]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:37.020]  Absolutely, and we couldn't do any of this
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.620]  without listener support.
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:41.460]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:43.220]  the real NPR of the base, right?
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:46.220]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.

[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:52.460]  Buy something, support the Info War.
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:54.460]  Keep Alex Jones, Orrin Schwoyer, Harrison Smith,
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:56.860]  Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:57.700]  Do it today.
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:58.520]  Do it now.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.060]  Support the Info War.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:04.340]  Info Wars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:06.060]  This is their big move.
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:08.780]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.820]  in the United States?
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.580]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:12.780]  That's not his job.
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:14.580]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:14.580 --> 01:44:17.500]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:22.940]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:24.700]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:25.540]  And that's who he works with.
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.940]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:30.820]  No, no, no.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:31.780]  Exactly.
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:34.380]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:35.380]  No, we will not take my-
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:38.460]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:40.940]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:43.420]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:45.460]  We say no to you selling us out
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:47.020]  to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:49.580]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.420]  You're right.
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:53.100]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.940]  And we say no.
[01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:56.860]  And we say no to your war.
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:02.340]  They decided to not perp walking,
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:04.860]  not put him in handcuffs, not do a mugshot
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:06.780]  because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.660]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.220]  We were waiting for the mugshot.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.380]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:12.980]  So we've made our own.
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.780]  And it says political prisoner
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:17.740]  with an image of President Trump.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:20.180]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.340]  It'll be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:26.100]  Political prisoner with Trump on the front there
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:28.900]  in a mugshot jail background.
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:30.020]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:34.100]  It says infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:35.700]  We also have Alex Jones for president.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.700]  No, I'm not running for president.
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:39.260]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:41.300]  Red, white, and blue, Alex Jones for president.
[01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:43.500]  2024, it's a fun conversational piece
[01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:44.460]  and a limited edition shirt.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:46.340]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:49.420]  So get your Alex Jones for president
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:54.420]  and Trump mugshot shirts at infowarsstore.com
[01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:58.820]  or by calling toll free, AAA, 253-3139.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:03.460]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:06.940]  highly toxic fried gases into the atmosphere.
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:09.700]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:13.100]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:16.180]  to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.420]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic,
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.500]  but containable.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:23.860]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:26.380]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.940]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:31.340]  was also the secretary of the treasury
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:33.860]  who was responsible for the public health service
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:34.820]  at the time.
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:38.140]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:41.460]  this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:43.700]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:47.540]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers
[01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:49.060]  and other disease.
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:52.780]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:55.140]  and a remedy to this madness.
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:58.500]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:06.260]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:30.380]  So we are back broadcasting worldwide and, you know, I'm telling you all this horrible
[01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:36.140]  stuff because it's all going on and everything I've told you, you can go verify for yourself
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.540]  right now, okay?
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:45.980]  We just showed medical site graphics, cartoon graphics of artificial penises, artificial
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.460]  tits, okay?
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:52.620]  Online, on Twitter, you can go see the actual medical videos and people complaining and
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:56.140]  saying what it was like and how hellish it is.
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:57.940]  So they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:01.580]  They're walking people into literal mind control, taking their mental illness and making it
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:02.580]  10 times worse.
[01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:07.220]  So I want to play back to back two different clips of people that are going public and
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.220]  speaking out against this.
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.900]  And remember, these are brainwashed victims coming out of it, so you still hear some of
[01:48:11.900 --> 01:48:12.900]  the brainwashing.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:13.900]  Here it is.
[01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:19.540]  Since my sex reassignment surgery, I had my SRS 10 years ago.
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:22.620]  It's been almost four years since I had the first stage of my vaginoplasty.
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:27.300]  I had my second SRS revision surgery.
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.940]  I am getting a second surgery.
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:33.220]  After my surgery, I was just in such a dark place and I didn't really want to talk about
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.220]  it.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:38.019]  I didn't really want to have to go back into it and feel all those feelings over again.
[01:48:38.019 --> 01:48:42.100]  I had a few complications, bleedings, infections.
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:45.700]  I've had complications and I've had a hard time.
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:50.060]  I did have some complications and I did have some, you know, concerns that not everybody
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:51.060]  deals with.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:54.580]  I thought it would make me happier and initially it did.
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:59.300]  Was that worse the constant issues I've had, the dilation I have to do for the rest of my
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:00.300]  life?
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.260]  I'm having the worst time with dilation.
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:08.580]  I was experiencing a little bit of dehiscence, which is basically when you are so swollen
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:12.300]  that the sutures that they put start to rip open.
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.660]  It was as bad as it sounds.
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:15.420]  I had trouble urinating.
[01:49:15.420 --> 01:49:19.420]  I kind of walked around with it for a year before I seeked help.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:26.660]  The reason I'm dilating twice a day is because if I miss once, it is so painful.
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:29.860]  I like dread it so much because it's so painful.
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:33.540]  I went to dilate again that night and I think that I moved a stitch.
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:38.620]  I don't know what happened, but something happened and I was in excruciating pain.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:44.420]  It felt like literally somebody had like shot me or stabbed me or burned me or something
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:45.420]  down there.
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:52.820]  I had to dilate and I had to try to open my urethra up and it was just like, yeah, I'm
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:53.820]  going to start crying.
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.900]  I was bleeding every time.
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:59.140]  I literally was going to pass out.
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:02.780]  I threw up because I had so much pain.
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:05.900]  I remember like bawling my eyes out saying like, what did I do?
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:06.900]  What did I do to myself?
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:07.900]  I fucked myself up.
[01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:09.360]  I'm never going to heal from this.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:15.340]  My body is constantly trying to heal after surgery since it considers it to be an open
[01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:16.340]  wound.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:20.260]  I mean, what can I do except go and have another revision?
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:23.980]  I remember starting to cry in the surgeon's office because I was like, I'm depressed.
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:24.980]  I'm in school.
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:26.060]  It's painful.
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:27.460]  Like it's just, it's a lot.
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:33.860]  The issues I had very early on should have been indications to me that I should not have
[01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:40.820]  done this, but I hated my male self so much that I needed to, and now there's no way to
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:41.820]  go back.
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.620]  You can never go back.
[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:47.460]  When you get out of surgery, it's not always going to go well.
[01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:53.660]  If I had known about the irreversible physical damage I caused my body, then I would have
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:55.460]  never done any of this.
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:58.260]  It's very much a commitment for life.
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:02.019]  You're going to have to rely on doctors for the rest of your life.
[01:51:02.019 --> 01:51:05.060]  Don't be like me and deny problems until it's too late.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:10.500]  Rather address them so you can be happier and live a healthier life.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:16.300]  The hardest part was like being sold something that I believe was going to help me and make
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:22.340]  me feel better only to do it, do all of it and come out on the other side, not feeling
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:23.340]  any better.
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:26.380]  I really can't, I can't ever undo it.
[01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:32.860]  I could have always waited, but I can't, I can't undo it now that I did it.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:42.540]  I began transitioning at 12 years old, 12 years old when I started Lupron and testosterone,
[01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:47.700]  and it was only a month after my 13th birthday that I had a double mastectomy.
[01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:53.100]  I was in a place when I made those decisions where I did not have my comorbidities under
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:59.820]  control, and that just shouldn't be how it is when you make these types of decisions.
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:07.820]  There's just a lot that goes into making such life-changing choices that it's almost
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:14.700]  under duress when you have all these comorbidities stacked up and these issues.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:21.540]  I came across Chloe Kohl's case one night while trying to research and Google where
[01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:30.860]  my doctors are now and if they're still practicing, and I saw the active sue letter in her lawsuit.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:41.820]  I am actively suing Kaiser Permanente, and I'm suing the doctors that gave me those
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:45.620]  treatments related to my transition.
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:51.380]  My name is Laila Jain, I'm 18 years old, and I am a woman who has detransitioned.
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:53:00.300]  And Democrats are trying to pass laws that you can't do.
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:04.780]  The different transitioning training for people that are not happy in the gay lifestyle to
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:08.580]  say, hey, you could be in the heterosexual lifestyle, you can become anonymous, you can
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:09.580]  become celibate.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:16.660]  Oh, no, we want to pass laws where you can't go and, quote, brainwash back.
[01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:17.660]  But I mean, here's the deal.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:22.220]  I'm not attacking anybody other than those that want to attack children.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.300]  If you're 18 years old.
[01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:27.390]  And you really want to go have your penis cut off.
[01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:29.390]  I don't like it.
[01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:31.390]  It's terrible, but taxpayers shouldn't pay for it.
[01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:33.390]  But you have a right to even commit suicide if you want.
[01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:35.390]  I believe people have a right to kill themselves.
[01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:37.390]  I don't think it's good. I think it's bad.
[01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:39.390]  But, you know,
[01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:41.390]  I've had friends that were in pain,
[01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:43.390]  had cancer, didn't want to hurt their family,
[01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:45.390]  didn't want to spend all the money, went out on the back 40,
[01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:47.390]  stuck a shotgun in their mouth, blew their head off.
[01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:49.390]  People I respected and loved killed themselves.
[01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:51.390]  I'm sad they did it, but, you know,
[01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:53.390]  they did it because they were, like in Japan,
[01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:55.390]  if the family can't make money,
[01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:57.390]  they can't do well, there's like six or seven of them.
[01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:59.390]  One person, you know, they got insurance, decides to commit suicide,
[01:53:59.390 --> 01:54:01.390]  they have a nice dinner with them, and the person kills themselves.
[01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:03.390]  Not a good thing.
[01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:05.390]  But to them, that's an honorable deal.
[01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:07.390]  Take care of the family.
[01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:09.390]  But when you target children
[01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:11.390]  when they're confused,
[01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:13.390]  when you're seven years old,
[01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:15.390]  and they ask you in school, this is all on record,
[01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:17.390]  to little boys, do you like little boys or little girls?
[01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:19.390]  Little boys will tell you, I like little boys.
[01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:21.390]  Because they want to play with them.
[01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:23.390]  Batman and Robin, they go, oh, we're putting that in your file.
[01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:25.390]  Who likes boys? Well, you want to have sex with boys?
[01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:27.390]  Same thing with girls. That's girls.
[01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:29.390]  Do you like girls or boys? Well, I like girls.
[01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:31.390]  Now, most boys say they want to be with boys.
[01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:33.390]  Most girls say they want to be with girls.
[01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:35.390]  I was always the type
[01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:37.390]  that I was just attracted to girls.
[01:54:37.390 --> 01:54:39.390]  I'd play with Barbies
[01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:41.390]  so I could hang out with the girls, because I thought they were pretty.
[01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:43.390]  I played with cowboys and Indians
[01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:45.390]  and Batman and Robin
[01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:47.390]  and Army as well.
[01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:49.390]  But I was more into
[01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:51.390]  playing doctor with the girls.
[01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:53.390]  So the issue here
[01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:55.390]  is that they're targeting our children when they're confused.
[01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:57.390]  It's run by the CIA,
[01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:59.390]  by MI6, by Tabasak Institute
[01:54:59.390 --> 01:55:01.390]  on record. It is a takedown of civilization
[01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:03.390]  operation, and of course
[01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:05.390]  the lawsuits are coming, but the system doesn't care.
[01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:07.390]  But this is horrible mutilation,
[01:55:07.390 --> 01:55:09.390]  horrible crimes. Now, Owen,
[01:55:09.390 --> 01:55:11.390]  I want to get your take on this situation,
[01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:13.390]  and then I'm going to host part of the next hour with you
[01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:15.390]  and then hand the baton to you.
[01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:17.390]  It's a fabulous job.
[01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:19.390]  I want listeners to also know that I said I'd get into Zuckerberg.
[01:55:19.390 --> 01:55:21.390]  I did not get into Zuckerberg,
[01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:23.390]  but I kind of got into it
[01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:25.390]  when I mentioned I was getting into Zuckerberg.
[01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:27.390]  But what I will do is bring up Zuckerberg
[01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:29.390]  with the guest, because this ties in
[01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:31.390]  to all of this, and then we'll have a full report
[01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:33.390]  next week. So I want to put all this together.
[01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:35.390]  But I did send the crew
[01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:37.390]  just a few screenshots of video
[01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:39.390]  that we're going to have
[01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:41.390]  from the air of Zuckerberg's compound.
[01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:43.390]  And so we'll show that
[01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:45.390]  next hour.
[01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:47.390]  But Scott Bennett
[01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:49.390]  was an Army officer
[01:55:49.390 --> 01:55:51.390]  in special operations, psychological warfare
[01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:53.390]  commissioned by Congress, did a lot of really
[01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:55.390]  huge operations and work,
[01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:57.390]  exposed government corruption,
[01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:59.390]  and he's extremely articulate. I want to get his
[01:55:59.390 --> 01:56:01.390]  take on what's happening in Russia,
[01:56:01.390 --> 01:56:03.390]  what's happening with the power grid attacks,
[01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:05.390]  what's happening with elites building all these bunkers,
[01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:07.390]  what's happening with the debt ceiling,
[01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:09.390]  and so much more. So look for that
[01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:11.390]  next hour. I'll co-host with Owen Schroeder.
[01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:13.390]  But going out to break here,
[01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:15.390]  Owen, I want to remind listeners that
[01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:17.390]  X3 is going to be sold out of current
[01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:19.390]  sales rates in a few weeks, but sold out
[01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:21.390]  for a long time before that. If you want to get it
[01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:23.390]  and get it discounted, you've got three or four
[01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:25.390]  days more. We're going to run the sale through Tuesday.
[01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:27.390]  Then it's going to go back to regular price until it
[01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:29.390]  sells out. Get X3 experience, try Iodine.

[01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:33.390]  or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:35.390]  Owen Schroeder, take us out to break with your
[01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:37.390]  take on the nightmares of transgenderism
[01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:39.390]  and the backlash.
[01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:41.390]  Let's just look how they apply this
[01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:43.390]  to ending debate
[01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:45.390]  and executing power.
[01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:47.390]  At Twitter today, we discovered
[01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:49.390]  Twitter censored the Daily
[01:56:49.390 --> 01:56:51.390]  Wire's new video called
[01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:53.390]  What is a Woman? Elon Musk
[01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:55.390]  hours later made a statement that this was done
[01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:57.390]  by rogue individuals at
[01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:59.390]  Twitter. So they're still trying to clear out some
[01:56:59.390 --> 01:57:01.390]  of these rogue groups at Twitter that are censoring
[01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:03.390]  content they don't like.
[01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:05.390]  So that's going to be on Twitter.
[01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:07.390]  Now, look at this example of a pitcher
[01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:09.390]  in Toronto who comes out, shares a video
[01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:11.390]  that says, hey, we Christians
[01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:13.390]  are going to be boycotting Target because of
[01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:15.390]  their pride propaganda aimed at children.
[01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:17.390]  He then issues an apology
[01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:19.390]  and it does nothing for him.
[01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:21.390]  He's still going to face punishment from the organization
[01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:23.390]  and he still has local media demanding
[01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:25.390]  he get traded. And then in Uganda,
[01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:27.390]  the Biden administration said,
[01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:29.390]  we're not going to give Uganda any
[01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:31.390]  aid
[01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:33.390]  if you guys don't accept gay marriage.
[01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:35.390]  Uganda basically said, fine,
[01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:37.390]  then we don't want your gay money.
[01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:39.390]  So it just shows how they try to use
[01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:41.390]  the power of the purse
[01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:43.390]  to force culture.
[01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:45.390]  As we go to this break, more from Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:07.390]  ...activated charcoal, essential oil,
[01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:09.390]  toothpaste as well.
[01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:11.390]  These are both incredible for your gums,
[01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:13.390]  polish your teeth, amazing to counter
[01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:15.390]  gingivitis, and they fund the InfoWar.
[01:58:15.390 --> 01:58:17.390]  There are no fillers in these products.
[01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:19.390]  These are fluoride-free,
[01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:21.390]  next-level toothpaste,
[01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:23.390]  $10,000 of each tube, limited run,
[01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:25.390]  available exclusively
[01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:27.390]  at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:29.390]  And your purchase funds the operation,
[01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:31.390]  plus these are incredible products you need.
[01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:33.390]  So, the Coral Calcium Tooth Lightening
[01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:35.390]  and the Activated Charcoal Essential Oil Toothpaste
[01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:37.390]  are now both back in stock
[01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:39.390]  at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:41.390]  I thank you for your support,
[01:58:41.390 --> 01:58:43.390]  but regardless, these are great products you need.
[01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:45.390]  So take action now.
[01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:47.390]  Go to InfoWarStore.com for both these great toothpastes
[01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:49.390]  back in stock.
[01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:51.390]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:53.390]  that the globalists were going to move
[01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:55.390]  against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:57.390]  People said, no way, he's the most pop, whatever happened.
[01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:59.390]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:58:59.390 --> 01:59:01.390]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:03.390]  because they believe they can control him.
[01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:05.390]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[01:59:05.390 --> 01:59:07.390]  he was taken off the air.
[01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:09.390]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:11.390]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox
[01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:13.390]  or controlled by George Soros
[01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:15.390]  or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:17.390]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:19.390]  And when you support us,
[01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:21.390]  we're unstoppable.
[01:59:21.390 --> 01:59:23.390]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch
[01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:25.390]  or by George Soros.
[01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:27.390]  I'm underwritten by you,
[01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:29.390]  which is we the people.
[01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:31.390]  Thank you for your support.
[01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:33.390]  Please don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:35.390]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:37.390]  We need your word of mouth,
[01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:39.390]  your prayer, your financial support
[01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:41.390]  while getting great products at the same time
[01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:43.390]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:45.390]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:47.390]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:42.020]  And the great Scott Bennett is with us, riding shotgun today.
[02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:44.020]  Owen Schroyer's been doing a fabulous job today.
[02:33:44.020 --> 02:33:46.020]  He's been very quiet listening.
[02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:53.020]  Owen, before we segue into other things that globalists are obviously preparing,
[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:56.020]  like the power outages and the rest of it,
[02:33:56.020 --> 02:33:59.020]  do you have any questions or comments for Mr. Bennett?
[02:33:59.020 --> 02:34:04.020]  Yeah, I'd like to get Scott's opinion on the most recent development out of Ukraine,
[02:34:04.020 --> 02:34:08.020]  because I find it extremely concerning.
[02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:13.020]  You had the U.S. and the U.K. both give 300 million,
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:17.020]  $300 million from the U.S., 300 million pounds from the U.K.
[02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:22.020]  This happened earlier this week, and then I guess 24 or 48 hours later,
[02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:27.020]  we saw allegedly a drone blow up an apartment building in Kiev,
[02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:32.020]  and then I guess a defunct Patriot missile land on a road in Kiev,
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:36.020]  and then Zelensky comes out and makes a statement,
[02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:41.020]  thank God for Joe Biden and Boris Johnson giving us the hundreds of millions of dollars,
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:44.020]  otherwise we wouldn't have been able to defend ourselves
[02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:47.020]  in the recent wave of attacks by Russia on Kiev.
[02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:51.020]  Now, I don't tend to buy any of this,
[02:34:51.020 --> 02:34:56.020]  the official narrative being that after $600 billion in pounds are given to Ukraine,
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:35:01.020]  within 48 hours somehow they set up an anti-air, anti-missile defense system
[02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:08.020]  that then is also utilized as Russia is attacking Kiev with hundreds of missiles, they're claiming.
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:12.020]  What do you think the real story here is, Scott Bennett?
[02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:16.020]  Well, it's a distraction operation, it's a shell game.
[02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:24.020]  That missile strike was curiously positioned to hit the traffic light right above it.
[02:35:24.020 --> 02:35:28.020]  The drone strike, of course, that was done against Moscow,
[02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:34.020]  precipitated by the US military code broadcast is extraordinarily suspicious,
[02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:40.020]  but it's a shell game where they're moving things in the darkness with their left hand,
[02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:44.020]  money laundering, child sex trafficking, organ harvesting,
[02:35:44.020 --> 02:35:52.020]  as they're doing these sort of kinetic operations against Russia.
[02:35:52.020 --> 02:35:55.020]  The kinetic operations are the cheerleading squad,
[02:35:55.020 --> 02:35:59.020]  the mainstream media does that everybody's eyes are focused on,
[02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:02.020]  but the real crimes are what they're doing in secret.
[02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:05.020]  So, Ukraine is descending into theater,
[02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:10.020]  and I think the West is going to increasingly kind of ratchet up
[02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:15.020]  a lot of their kinetic threats and their slogans of democracy
[02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:19.020]  while they do other things such as the invasion across the border,
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:22.020]  which I think the Democrats are all preparing,
[02:36:22.020 --> 02:36:28.020]  and others are preparing for an inevitable civil war in the United States,
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:30.020]  and they're setting the seeds for that.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:34.020]  So, do you believe, though, that within 48 hours,
[02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:38.020]  $300 million, £300 million were transferred into Ukraine,
[02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:41.020]  and then they were able to set up an anti-missile defense system
[02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:45.020]  that essentially saved the city of Kiev from destruction from the Russians,
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:47.020]  or do you think that's just a bunch of BS?
[02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:49.020]  No, it's lies.
[02:36:49.020 --> 02:36:54.020]  The Ukrainians are incapable of performing the military tasks
[02:36:54.020 --> 02:36:57.020]  required for the training on those weapons systems.
[02:36:57.020 --> 02:37:00.020]  Everyone who's been in the military, who's been an artilleryman,
[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:04.020]  who's been in any kind of missile rockets or high technology,
[02:37:04.020 --> 02:37:10.020]  who's not a door kicker, understands these are systems
[02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:16.020]  that are just not able to be managed and conducted by Ukrainian forces
[02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:21.020]  who are very incapable of conducting much of anything, quite frankly.
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:25.020]  This is all controlled by British, American, French, German special operations
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:27.020]  and mercenary.
[02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:30.020]  They are, of course, funneling money for secret operations.
[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:33.020]  They're funneling money for money laundering purposes,
[02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:35.020]  as we saw with FDX.
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:37.020]  So, again, it's theater, it's a shell game.
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:41.020]  I do see Rushi Shunak and Biden and the rest of these people
[02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:44.020]  pouring more and more money into Ukraine.
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:48.020]  We'll see if the Republicans stop it, audit it, and trace it back.
[02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:52.020]  It's interesting that a lot of the people that were directly enriched
[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:57.020]  by Burisma, MetaBiota, the Global Viral Forecasting Institute,
[02:37:57.020 --> 02:38:02.020]  the chemical bio labs, were John Kerry's son, Christopher Hines,
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:07.020]  Paul Pelosi Jr., Pelosi's son, Romney's son, and, of course,
[02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:11.020]  the crack-smoking prostitute, child-raping Hunter Biden.
[02:38:11.020 --> 02:38:14.020]  So the progeny of the most perverted, corrupt people in politics
[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:16.020]  are the ones who are being enriched.
[02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:20.020]  And, of course, Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced articles of impeachment
[02:38:20.020 --> 02:38:22.020]  against Biden for a lot of this stuff.
[02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:23.020]  And that's good.
[02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:26.020]  Scott, let me ask you a question here, Scott,
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:28.020]  because I want to get back to this.
[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:29.020]  You got caught off at the very start.
[02:38:29.020 --> 02:38:31.020]  You started getting into the drone attacks on Moscow
[02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:32.020]  and this code that went out.
[02:38:32.020 --> 02:38:35.020]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:38.020]  Well, the code that was released was from an American voice,
[02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:43.020]  an American military voice, seemingly educated with the nomenclature,
[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:49.020]  the emergency broadcast messaging system that military, cyber, NSA
[02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:51.020]  sort of operations conduct.
[02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:55.020]  And this code was released, and the Russian intelligence,
[02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:01.020]  Russian media had acquired it, and we're trying to find out what it did,
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:02.020]  what it was.
[02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:06.020]  Was it pre-attack, during attack, or post-attack?
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:09.020]  Was it to launch the operation?
[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:12.020]  Was it to announce the operation had been launched?
[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:16.020]  Or was it to announce that an operation had been launched
[02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:19.020]  and that the West had better prepared for counter-strikes?
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:20.020]  We don't know yet.
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:23.020]  Everyone should certainly call their member of Congress and say,
[02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:25.020]  what is Operation Fishhook?
[02:39:25.020 --> 02:39:26.020]  And what is this broadcast?
[02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:28.020]  And I've got it, and I can play it.
[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:32.020]  But that needs to be put to Kirby, who interestingly said,
[02:39:32.020 --> 02:39:35.020]  we're not going to investigate that Moscow drone strike.
[02:39:35.020 --> 02:39:39.020]  When it was with Adam yesterday that we had said,
[02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:40.020]  this needs to be investigated.
[02:39:40.020 --> 02:39:44.020]  This needs to be examined by Jim Jordan and Marjorie Greene and Gates.
[02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:46.020]  This needs to be examined by the Republicans to say,
[02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:49.020]  did Biden launch a war without congressional approval?
[02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:53.020]  Did Biden initiate a war crime and a crime against humanity
[02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:55.020]  by attacking civilian targets?
[02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:56.020]  Did this code announce it?
[02:39:56.020 --> 02:39:57.020]  Did Fishhook announce it?
[02:39:57.020 --> 02:39:59.020]  Were you trying to hook a fish?
[02:39:59.020 --> 02:40:02.020]  Were you trying to hook Russia into a provocative action?
[02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:04.020]  Like you wisely outlined, Alex,
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:09.020]  when Churchill fishhooked the Germans into attacking their civilian centers,
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:11.020]  it changed the course of the war.
[02:40:11.020 --> 02:40:16.020]  Were they trying to get Russia to attack civilian targets
[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:20.020]  and perhaps launch nuclear targets to change the direction of the war?
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:22.020]  Possibly.
[02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:23.020]  I think that's obvious.
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:27.020]  They've been trying to accelerate this, which, again, is playing with fire.
[02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:30.020]  Up until about three years ago, even when Trump wasn't in,
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:33.020]  I remember when Obama was wanting to go to war with Russia in Syria,
[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:35.020]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs said,
[02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:37.020]  that's going to war with Russia if Mr. President wants to do that.
[02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:39.020]  We have to prepare for nuclear war.
[02:40:39.020 --> 02:40:41.020]  Something changed where all the –
[02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:43.020]  I mean, even Henry Kissinger was saying, don't do this.
[02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:45.020]  And then they just said, you know what, we're just going to do it.
[02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:46.020]  We can get away with it.
[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:49.020]  And it shows that the so-called elites, as you said,
[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:51.020]  are not the ones of 50 years ago.
[02:40:51.020 --> 02:40:54.020]  They are literally a bunch of degenerate pedophiles.
[02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:57.020]  I mean, because we had evil elites before,
[02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:59.020]  but they didn't have a suicide wish.
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:03.020]  These current ones, I guess, have never gotten in trouble or never been stopped.
[02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:05.020]  And so they're just in cuckoo land.
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:10.020]  It's a very accurate psychological assessment, Alex,
[02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:16.020]  because the soil from which men's minds grow is far more polluted and toxic today
[02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:18.020]  than it was 50 years ago.
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:23.020]  50, 60 years ago, we had a relatively traditional American society
[02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:27.020]  where the Constitution and our heritage and our 100 years of history mattered.
[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:30.020]  It had grown the greatest generation in World War II.
[02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:35.020]  It had grown the 50s and the 60s and the parents and grandparents that came out of that.
[02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:37.020]  I was grown in the 70s.
[02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:41.020]  And we had a better America back then and in the 80s too.
[02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:48.020]  And it was because of those greatest generations that we did conquer and defeat communism.
[02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:50.020]  But then we took a course for the wicked,
[02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:54.020]  and we took a course of raping and dismembering Russia in the 1990s
[02:41:54.020 --> 02:41:57.020]  under the chief rapist, Bill Clinton.
[02:41:57.020 --> 02:42:07.020]  Why he's not been charged for rapes that he's done against people like Juanita Hill or others is amazing.
[02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:10.020]  They have the gall to go after President Trump for a cuckoo nonsense rape charge.
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:17.020]  But in the 1990s, Bill Clinton and Lawrence Summers and Strobe Talbot and Al Gore,
[02:42:17.020 --> 02:42:22.020]  the great wizard of climate change, all embarked on this attack against Russia,
[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:26.020]  raping and dismembering Russia, planting oligarchs, stealing resources,
[02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:29.020]  supplanting the election, planting CIA stooges in there,
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:33.020]  trying to completely collapse its economy with IMF loans.
[02:42:33.020 --> 02:42:38.020]  And then that made the Russians go back to being nationalists and actually created Putin.
[02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:41.020]  So again, they never looked at how they're creating the hard lines.
[02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:45.020]  And just like the West trying to screw the Chinese gives us a Xi Jinping.
[02:42:47.020 --> 02:42:51.020]  You're exactly right. We did that in the 90s.
[02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:54.020]  We'll be right back. We're going to break. Stay there. Stay there, Scott. Amazing.
[02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:29.020]  Pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine and so much more.
[02:43:29.020 --> 02:43:35.020]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide
[02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:39.020]  have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:42.020]  Most iodine is bound to other elements. You don't absorb it.
[02:43:42.020 --> 02:43:47.020]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:53.020]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com. It's being sold out for over six months for 25 percent off.
[02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:57.020]  X3 back in stock. Take action now. Infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:57.020 --> 02:44:01.020]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:05.020]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the army.
[02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:10.020]  There is a bulletin from CBS News. President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:44:10.020 --> 02:44:13.020]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:44:14.020 --> 02:44:18.020]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:21.020]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:44:21.020 --> 02:44:25.020]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:29.020]  It was almost as if there were a plan in place. It just can't happen.
[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:33.020]  We need to go into the capital. That's it. That's it.
[02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:37.020]  You will always have conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distractions.
[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:42.020]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:45.020]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:52.020]  As soon as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[02:44:57.020 --> 02:45:03.020]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:06.020]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[02:45:06.020 --> 02:45:11.020]  This is a psychotic death cult. Period. Case closed. Out to get you and your family.
[02:45:11.020 --> 02:45:16.020]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:19.020]  It's been around about 15 years. Became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:45:19.020 --> 02:45:25.020]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[02:45:25.020 --> 02:45:29.020]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:32.020]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:36.020]  But you can go pay two or three times. There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:42.020]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of a leading competitor.
[02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:47.020]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:50.020]  You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb this crap.
[02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:52.020]  But I'm done talking about that.
[02:45:52.020 --> 02:45:57.020]  The point is you can get the filters at m4store.com. They're discounted right now. Finally back in stock.
[02:45:57.020 --> 02:46:03.020]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air.
[02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:06.020]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:08.020]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:11.020]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:14.020]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:16.020]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:22.020]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[02:46:22.020 --> 02:46:26.020]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:28.020]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[02:46:28.020 --> 02:46:33.020]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:36.020]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:39.020]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:42.020]  Please don't take Infowars for granted.
[02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:44.020]  We're barely hanging on.
[02:46:44.020 --> 02:46:49.020]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:49.020 --> 02:46:52.020]  So don't procrastinate. Go to infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:56.020]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[02:46:58.020 --> 02:47:03.020]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:03.020 --> 02:47:05.020]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:23.400]  All right, we've only got one segment left with our incredible guest, Scott Bennett.
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:25.080]  Everybody should visit his website.
[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:31.480]  Everybody should bookmark it, GlobalFreedomTV.com.
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:32.480]  I'm on the road.
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:33.480]  I'm back tomorrow.
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:38.160]  And I just noticed, I didn't plug this iPad in like an idiot this morning.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.160]  It was at 100%.
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:40.160]  It's at 5%.
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:41.160]  So this cuts out in a minute.
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:46.160]  Or maybe I'll get up while everyone's talking or while Scott's talking and plug this stupid
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:47.160]  thing in here.
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.600]  But that's a perfect segue when I was about to get into here, Scott.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:55.080]  When we sit here and we talk about the globalists being incompetent and out of control, it's
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:48:01.080]  not like we're saying we're in a great position or we've got all the answers.
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:05.920]  It's more scary to have incompetent, crazy, inbred, pedophiles, psychos.
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:07.920]  So when we say that, it's not like, oh, our enemies are idiots.
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:08.920]  Oh, we're doing great.
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:13.480]  No, our enemies are super dangerous because they're out of control, and that can make
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:20.840]  other adversaries and groups really then be in a posture that could end the world very,
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:21.840]  very, very quickly.
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:22.840]  I know you analyze that.
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:23.840]  You understand that.
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:24.840]  So I want to be very clear.
[02:48:24.840 --> 02:48:29.039]  Just because the globalists are out of control does not mean that they aren't even more dangerous
[02:48:29.039 --> 02:48:30.039]  because of that.
[02:48:30.039 --> 02:48:34.720]  So I wanted to finish up with just that understanding, and then I wanted to get into a little more
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:37.560]  on the power grid because I'm seeing massive pre-programming on that.
[02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:41.680]  And again, they're now saying that right-wing Christians work with the Russians, kind of
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:45.680]  integrating those two lies, the new, we're all white supremacists, ADL is going to get
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:49.760]  you and all this legislation, and then, oh, we work with the Russians, we're going to
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.680]  combine those two giant hoaxes together, they're going to need some pretext to make that sound
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:55.680]  like it's reasonable.
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:48:58.720]  And of course, we'd say that dog won't husk a blow up in your face.
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:00.800]  Well, they just keep doubling down.
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:06.760]  And then I want to segue into Kauai, where I did a work case in the last week and a half
[02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:09.960]  because I wasn't going to Alaska, never been there, but we've been to Kauai quite a few
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:10.960]  times.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.119]  And I said, I want to go back there because Zuckerberg, according to my sources, is building
[02:49:14.119 --> 02:49:18.800]  a big underground base and a submarine base and trying to set up robot defenses.
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:20.279]  He doesn't trust the security people.
[02:49:20.279 --> 02:49:24.760]  So I came here and I met with a lot of construction firms, a lot of other groups, they make them
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:29.720]  sign NDAAs, but we confirmed, and we'll show some just still shots real quick.
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:32.240]  I'm going to show this when I get back to Austin in HD.
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:34.880]  You put those on screen, guys, I'll send them to you.
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:37.119]  This is from a helicopter.
[02:49:37.119 --> 02:49:41.920]  You can see the big dome buildings that they've built.
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:47.240]  And under that, there's just dump trucks going in and out all day as they dig in.
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:49.440]  And then understand how big those are.
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:59.720]  This giant 40,000-square-foot house is just a little box there below one of those facilities.
[02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:05.800]  So just like the NSA builds these big giant hangar bubbles that you could put a 747 in,
[02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:08.520]  just that entrance, then there are also aircraft hangars.
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:11.480]  They've got giant construction going on all over.
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:18.320]  He's got thousands and thousands of acres, and again, there's a big mountain of gourds
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:19.320]  there.
[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:25.039]  This is literally a James Bond villain, or like the Nazis had, underground sub-base.
[02:50:25.039 --> 02:50:29.560]  If you try to get anywhere out 200 yards from the land, drones and armed troops come
[02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:31.640]  out and get in your face, even though it's public property.
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:35.600]  If you get on the beach, they basically assault you.
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:39.320]  And I'm just showing some grainy stuff here before I get back, because people don't want
[02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:40.320]  to see the actual HD.
[02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:44.800]  They love little grainy things, but this is just some of what people are going to be
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:46.199]  seeing and what's happening.
[02:50:46.199 --> 02:50:48.359]  But the big issue is it's feverish now.
[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:50.279]  20-plus billionaires have moved here.
[02:50:50.279 --> 02:50:51.480]  A bunch are affiliated with them.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:52.960]  They're also in Tasmania.
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:56.000]  They're also in northern areas of Canada.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:59.880]  Some of these redoubts are 100 miles from even a small town.
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:03.279]  And now the globalists are—and I've also met with some Bilderberg group members and
[02:51:03.279 --> 02:51:06.240]  others off-record last year.
[02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:09.720]  They said, yeah, they're getting ready for a catastrophic situation.
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:11.359]  What do I think is going to happen with Russia?
[02:51:11.359 --> 02:51:13.000]  So they all get how dangerous this is.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:19.279]  So why are they then not pushing for de-escalation, Scott Bennett, and instead they're going
[02:51:19.279 --> 02:51:22.960]  along with the policy, but at the same time, like turtles, going into their shells?
[02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:26.400]  They've been digging in for a while, but now it's feverish digging in.
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.039]  What's your intel on that?
[02:51:28.039 --> 02:51:32.279]  Well, let me issue a couple of corrections on the website.
[02:51:32.279 --> 02:51:37.720]  A better website we have is patreon.com slash Shell Game, the global freedom we put our
[02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:40.279]  videos on, but all the breaking ones that I just did—
[02:51:40.279 --> 02:51:43.160]  Well, let's slow down then, because I asked the crew to get me last time and this time
[02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:44.160]  the best thing.
[02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:45.160]  So we're going to put it in your bio.
[02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:46.560]  I want you to come back on a routine basis.
[02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:47.560]  I apologize.
[02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:50.480]  I want to get the right URL up here for you.
[02:51:50.480 --> 02:51:54.199]  Okay, so just very slowly, we're going to put it on screen, your lower third.
[02:51:54.199 --> 02:51:57.279]  What is the proper place for people to go to?
[02:51:57.279 --> 02:52:04.840]  Go to patreon.com slash Shell Game, and that has all the videos that I do on Russian TV,
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:08.080]  other international TV, so you get the breaking news.
[02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:12.359]  And then, of course, shellgamewhistleblower.com, they can contact me.
[02:52:12.359 --> 02:52:17.359]  GlobalfreedomTV.com is another channel that we have that we put this up.
[02:52:17.359 --> 02:52:18.359]  And you—
[02:52:18.359 --> 02:52:19.359]  What about the site I gave out?
[02:52:19.359 --> 02:52:23.359]  I mean, the last site I gave out, is that—
[02:52:23.359 --> 02:52:24.359]  Yep, that's good.
[02:52:24.359 --> 02:52:25.359]  That's good.
[02:52:25.359 --> 02:52:26.359]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:52:26.359 --> 02:52:28.359]  That's the one where you put up a lot of our breaking videos.
[02:52:28.359 --> 02:52:32.960]  But again, I want people to find what you're saying, Scott, because it's so dead on.
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:36.400]  Let's say all the URLs one more time.
[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:42.640]  Go to patreon.com slash Shell Game, that's where we put our breaking videos up.
[02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:47.720]  Shellgamewhistleblower.com is how they can contact me and see my story.
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:55.119]  And globalfreedomTV.com is a news TV site that we're erecting and putting my videos
[02:52:55.119 --> 02:52:57.960]  on and putting other videos.
[02:52:57.960 --> 02:53:04.680]  We've got a lot of your good stuff and other good stuff, Mike Brighteon, Dr. Fett, a lot
[02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:06.960]  of good people up there in their different stuff.
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:08.920]  So those are the three websites.
[02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:14.199]  The other thing I'd say in these times, getting your health in order and all the substances
[02:53:14.199 --> 02:53:18.960]  you've got are very important for people to get because if there is an EMT attack, if there
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:25.279]  is a power shortage or a breakdown of the power supply, people need to be able to live for
[02:53:25.279 --> 02:53:26.520]  six months to a year.
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:31.359]  You have to have the supplements and vitamins, never mind the food, and the natural curatives
[02:53:31.359 --> 02:53:32.359]  and stuff.
[02:53:32.960 --> 02:53:37.560]  One of the things that I discovered when I had a skin cancer was Indian black salve.
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:42.600]  Alex, I'll send you the pictures of the cancer that I had, but I put this stuff on it, it
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:45.800]  killed it, and the cancer fell off like a scab.
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:48.720]  So Indian black salve is miraculous.
[02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:57.760]  Now getting back to the business, you identified a very significant factor, the soil that we've
[02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:02.199]  grown these people out of today is very toxic compared to 50 years ago.
[02:54:03.199 --> 02:54:08.320]  One thing people need to be prepared to do is to detach themselves and divorce themselves
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:15.960]  from their psychological moorings and connections and instincts of subservience and obedience
[02:54:15.960 --> 02:54:21.880]  towards political lanyards or claims of power, claims of authority, claims of jurisdiction.
[02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:27.440]  When I was in the army, I was an officer and I was told any order that is unlawful or the
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:33.240]  commander may be crazy or is out of his mind, you don't follow because you are serving
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:34.800]  the Constitution of the United States.
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:36.279]  You are keeping your men alive.
[02:54:36.279 --> 02:54:38.560]  You're not following unlawful orders.
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:42.640]  So these orders that are coming out of the fake President Biden and the crazy Pelosi
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:48.240]  and all the other crazy Democrats and many in the military are unlawful orders.
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:52.520]  No one should be getting a vaccine, a COVID-19 bio jab ever again.
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:56.240]  They shouldn't be getting any vaccines as far as I'm concerned, after listening to Tenpenny
[02:54:56.240 --> 02:54:58.000]  and Mikovits and everybody else.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:03.520]  So their unlawful orders are being advanced and that's where people need to cut themselves
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:09.160]  off and say, no, we're not recognizing the FBI or the ATF or any of these other federal
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:10.720]  agencies that were created.
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:14.000]  We're following the Constitution and we're following our local sheriff.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:20.199]  We're following our local powers and hopefully some strong governors.
[02:55:20.199 --> 02:55:24.600]  So that's going to facilitate the quickening of the regionalization of America is the divorce
[02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:28.640]  from the claims of authority and power that the federal police state has been trying to
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:31.800]  ram down everybody's throats.
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:34.840]  I'll hand it back to you to get back into what other segue you wanted to talk about.
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:38.920]  Well, I mean, that's my question is it was a former intel and science officer who worked
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:39.920]  all over the world.
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:41.680]  It really has a great analysis.
[02:55:41.680 --> 02:55:45.720]  They're losing on every level, but they're pre-programming power outages, cyber attacks
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:48.960]  to blame us to get more Internet control and demonize us.
[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:49.960]  That's clear.
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:50.960]  But it's so obvious.
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:53.439]  Do you think they're really crazy enough to do that?
[02:55:53.439 --> 02:55:56.680]  And what else are they going to try to pull to be the saviors?
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:01.600]  I do think they are crazy because they think and they only expect to survive or escape
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:07.360]  in the in the fire and the smoke of war conflict and the power systems going down and other
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:10.279]  natural disasters, fires, floods.
[02:56:10.279 --> 02:56:16.800]  I anticipate amplification of the weather weapons, you know, being used.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:21.960]  The thing is, every time they're engaging these activities, the righteous are waking
[02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:28.360]  up and more and more disconnecting themselves psychically, emotionally, spiritually, physically
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:32.560]  from the dependence on this matrix.
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:33.760]  Look at the mainstream media.
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:36.060]  It's lost all credibility.
[02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:39.279]  Look at Target and Bud Light, all credibility gone.
[02:56:39.279 --> 02:56:45.199]  Now, I've heard analysis that this is a coordinated weaponization against Target and others to
[02:56:45.199 --> 02:56:49.160]  implode them from within to quicken sort of an economic collapse.
[02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:54.080]  But you see the righteous spirit of Americans rising up when they reject the ideology of
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:59.160]  demonism, lesbian, gay, transgender, humanism, transgenderism, all of that stuff.
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:00.160]  That's not American.
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:01.160]  That's not human.
[02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:06.760]  So we're witnessing the left incapable of adjustment, incapable of backing up, incapable
[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:09.800]  of compromise, incapable of reflection.
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:17.439]  But they are capable like rats in a maze trying to figure out a different route to go.
[02:57:17.439 --> 02:57:18.439]  But it's for self-preservation.
[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:26.920]  The thing is, people need to, like in Zuckerberg, a.k.a. Rothschild kid or whatever, they need
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:32.320]  to understand where they're fleeing to, understand that their time is short.
[02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:33.320]  Do five more minutes with us.
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:34.320]  Hold on, we've got to go break for two minutes.
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:35.320]  Scott Bennett.
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:36.320]  Do five more minutes.
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:37.320]  Exactly.
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:38.320]  I want you to get into the bunker questions because that's exactly where I was going with
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:39.320]  this.
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:40.320]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:50.720]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:57:50.720 --> 02:57:52.800]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:54.840]  It will change your life.
[02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:59.320]  The UN admits, and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:03.560]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:09.080]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:14.800]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:19.120]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:25.200]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:26.200]  effect.
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:30.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months, it's very hard to produce, and
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:32.160]  it's finally back in stock.
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:35.200]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:39.800]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful, you and your family need it, it's 25% off, back
[02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:45.240]  in stock, X3, triiodine, exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:48.120]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:55.080]  TurboForce is back, sold out for eight months, and it's TurboForce+, we made it even stronger.
[02:58:55.080 --> 02:59:00.640]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, TurboForce is back in stock
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:05.720]  at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:05.720 --> 02:59:12.280]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours, should be
[02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:13.880]  called 10-hour energy.
[02:59:13.880 --> 02:59:19.360]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:24.480]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name
[02:59:24.480 --> 02:59:25.480]  it.
[02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:31.680]  It is the super fuel, RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Ultra is great, they're two different
[02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:37.680]  nitrophics, they go good with this, but this is the King Kong, this is the boss.
[02:59:37.680 --> 02:59:44.680]  TurboForce, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com, more power, more strength, more energy.
[02:59:50.680 --> 02:59:55.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:02.680 --> 03:00:09.680]  I want to be clear here in this final segment before our next guest host takes over, that
[03:00:09.680 --> 03:00:14.680]  Owen Schroeder will host the forum today at 6 p.m., double duty here.
[03:00:14.680 --> 03:00:18.680]  In this final segment with Scott Bennett, I want Owen to pop up with any questions or
[03:00:18.680 --> 03:00:22.680]  comments he's got, but I want to just get back to, I told people 20 years ago, the elites
[03:00:22.680 --> 03:00:27.680]  were building on their own mutters and stuff, but in the last five years, they've been accelerating
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:34.680]  to its fever pitch, and then now, they're literally gone into overdrive.
[03:00:34.680 --> 03:00:36.680]  So, what does that say about the establishment?
[03:00:36.680 --> 03:00:41.680]  They're creating a world with more power and vertical integration of the economy, even
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:43.680]  though that creates starvation, death, and crime.
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:48.680]  They defund the police, they defund society, and then they think they're still going to
[03:00:48.680 --> 03:00:54.680]  have money and infrastructure to pay the paramilitary police, and of course, the robots will never
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:55.680]  save them.
[03:00:55.680 --> 03:01:00.680]  So, these people act like they're really smart, and they're in control because they're ruthless,
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:04.680]  but they really only think it looks like one or two dimensionally.
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:07.680]  What am I missing here, and what do you make of all this bunker news?
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:10.680]  Well, I think the bunker news is accurate.
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:17.680]  It follows the infrastructure development that is the escape valve for their delusion.
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:20.680]  They're under a delusion, a demonic delusion.
[03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:27.680]  They're under a predictable future that is entirely different from the reality that's
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:28.680]  coming.
[03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:33.680]  They think in a certain way, and they think there's going to be an inevitability of transhumanism,
[03:01:33.680 --> 03:01:37.680]  that their consciousness is going to be stored in alternative formations, that there's all
[03:01:37.680 --> 03:01:41.680]  sorts of extraterrestrial intervention in this, too.
[03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:49.680]  We know the demonic, nephilim, spiritual reality of that, but they're under a different mythology
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:50.680]  with regards to that.
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:55.680]  I think the X-Files was very good at predicting a lot of this material with regards to viruses
[03:01:55.680 --> 03:02:00.680]  and bees and spreading all sorts of things that would transform human society.
[03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:02.680]  I think they're under the same delusion.
[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:07.680]  So, the bunkers that are being built, I think, are with the expectation that they are going
[03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:15.680]  to trigger Russia or China or both into some sort of a nuclear wasting of the United States.
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:22.680]  Their population control obsession is part of that.
[03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:28.680]  They anticipate Zuckerberg is somehow going to inherit all of the Hawaiian Island or people
[03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:33.680]  moving up into Yellowstone or other places where there's going to be no human beings
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:35.680]  around except them.
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:43.680]  This is part of the delusion, but the bunker creation of subterranean or alternative living
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:51.680]  quarters, I think it's a sign of their expectation that they can trigger and create world-destroying
[03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:56.680]  events, and that the American people are going to be sheep in a pasture and not have any
[03:02:56.680 --> 03:02:58.680]  say in the matter, where I think the opposite is true.
[03:02:58.680 --> 03:03:04.680]  The American people are rising up and casting off this perception.
[03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:10.680]  You're right, not being sheep, because imagine, Scott, I agree, imagine society breaks down,
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:13.680]  everyone literally hates Zuckerberg.
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:14.680]  They all know where he lives.
[03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:16.680]  So, there's a nuclear war and society's falling apart.
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:17.680]  Everybody's starving to death.
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:19.680]  You're going to have everybody going there.
[03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:22.680]  I mean, he's an idiot.
[03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:30.680]  Yeah, his life is already cost and suspect.
[03:03:30.680 --> 03:03:35.680]  I don't see Zuckerberg or any of these people escaping the French Revolution that's coming,
[03:03:35.680 --> 03:03:40.680]  which will hang them by the neck and put their heads on pikes after due process of law,
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:42.680]  and due process of law is coming.
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:52.340]  Well, it looks like we've had the inevitable crash of Alex Jones' iPad here, Scott.
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:54.100]  So great stuff here.
[03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:55.780]  We've got 60 seconds left of this break.
[03:03:55.780 --> 03:03:58.420]  Let people know one more time where they can find your work.
[03:03:58.420 --> 03:04:00.780]  Well, keep fighting the good fight, Owen.
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:01.860]  It's good to be with you, too.
[03:04:01.860 --> 03:04:03.220]  I love the beard.
[03:04:03.220 --> 03:04:05.460]  Go to shellgamewhistleblower.com.
[03:04:05.460 --> 03:04:06.700]  You can email me.
[03:04:06.700 --> 03:04:08.940]  We can get you the information on the Indian black salve.
[03:04:08.940 --> 03:04:09.940]  It's a healer.
[03:04:09.940 --> 03:04:12.060]  It'll cure my cancer.
[03:04:12.060 --> 03:04:13.820]  So I hope it does the same for other people.
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:18.300]  And if you want to see the videos and the news that we put out, go to patreon.com slash
[03:04:18.300 --> 03:04:24.540]  shellgame and globalfreedomtv.com is our news outlet.
[03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:26.100]  So always good to be with you.
[03:04:26.100 --> 03:04:27.100]  All right.
[03:04:27.100 --> 03:04:28.100]  Thank you, Scott.
[03:04:28.100 --> 03:04:30.420]  And Alex's iPod died.
[03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:35.140]  I will say from Alex, thank you a lot for coming on today.
[03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:36.140]  My pleasure, brother.
[03:04:36.140 --> 03:04:37.140]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[03:04:37.140 --> 03:04:38.140]  All right.
[03:04:38.140 --> 03:04:39.140]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:39.140 --> 03:04:43.180]  Now, when we come back, Drew Hernandez is connected.
[03:04:43.180 --> 03:04:46.100]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour of today's transmission.
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:47.580]  I'll be back hosting the war room.
[03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:50.580]  I got so much news, so many video clips to get to.
[03:04:50.580 --> 03:04:58.860]  Do not tune away from the InfoWars live transmissions.
[03:04:58.860 --> 03:05:04.260]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:05:04.260 --> 03:05:05.620]  supply.
[03:05:05.620 --> 03:05:10.300]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:14.500]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[03:05:14.500 --> 03:05:17.320]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:20.660]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:25.860]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:05:25.860 --> 03:05:28.620]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:05:28.620 --> 03:05:35.260]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient
[03:05:35.260 --> 03:05:39.580]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:05:39.580 --> 03:05:48.380]  Our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best pure nascent iodine stabilized
[03:05:48.380 --> 03:05:54.740]  in an activated tri iodine form for a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism.
[03:05:54.740 --> 03:06:04.020]  Get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:04.020 --> 03:06:10.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarriors and based thought criminals worldwide, welcome to the
[03:06:10.500 --> 03:06:12.860]  fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:15.940]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:06:15.940 --> 03:06:23.020]  Well, here we are, June 1st, with what the woke mob likes to call Pride Month, which
[03:06:23.020 --> 03:06:31.300]  is essentially in reality the worship of Lucifer month, because we know that the fall of Lucifer,
[03:06:31.300 --> 03:06:39.700]  the originator of pride, the OG proud one, according to the Bible, Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28,
[03:06:39.700 --> 03:06:47.020]  these various passages, we know that that is essentially the worship of Lucifer.
[03:06:47.020 --> 03:06:50.280]  What's the ultimate Luciferian worship?
[03:06:50.280 --> 03:06:58.980]  Is it running around with 666 everywhere, blood sacrifice, black magic, witchcraft, getting
[03:06:58.980 --> 03:07:02.780]  involved with the occult, pledging your allegiance to Satan?
[03:07:02.780 --> 03:07:09.780]  Yes, all of those things fall under the category of Luciferianism.
[03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:13.260]  And obviously, according to the Bible, I'll be honest with you, the Bible says if you're
[03:07:13.260 --> 03:07:16.580]  not born again, you're a son or a daughter of disobedience.
[03:07:16.580 --> 03:07:19.800]  You are a son or daughter of Lucifer if you're not born again.
[03:07:19.800 --> 03:07:22.820]  You're not with Father God, you're with Father the Devil.
[03:07:22.820 --> 03:07:23.820]  It's that simple.
[03:07:23.820 --> 03:07:24.820]  It's black and white.
[03:07:24.820 --> 03:07:25.820]  All right.
[03:07:25.820 --> 03:07:27.100]  It's that black and white.
[03:07:27.220 --> 03:07:29.140]  It's that simple.
[03:07:29.140 --> 03:07:35.780]  But I'll tell you one thing to specifically highlight an entire month dedicated to one
[03:07:35.780 --> 03:07:50.020]  thing, pride and the absolute opposition towards God's original biological prescribed practice
[03:07:50.020 --> 03:07:51.020]  for humanity.
[03:07:51.020 --> 03:07:52.020]  This goes to Genesis.
[03:07:52.020 --> 03:07:54.940]  This is the Genesis of humanity.
[03:07:54.980 --> 03:08:01.180]  So not only is it a big F you to God, because the Bible makes it very clear, there are seven
[03:08:01.180 --> 03:08:04.260]  things that God hates that he finds are an abomination.
[03:08:04.260 --> 03:08:06.660]  One of those things is God hates a proud look.
[03:08:06.660 --> 03:08:10.900]  That's what the Bible says, means he disdains it, despises it.
[03:08:10.900 --> 03:08:16.820]  When you turn around and you blaspheme God's original design for procreation, you invert
[03:08:16.820 --> 03:08:23.940]  what a marriage is supposed to be between biological male, biological female, not in union of fornication,
[03:08:23.940 --> 03:08:30.300]  but in union of holy matrimony to honor God and for the purpose of procreation.
[03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:33.340]  That's one gigantic offense, okay?
[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:38.860]  But also identifying it and branding it in the name of pride.
[03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:44.900]  Here we are, June 1st, 2023, with all the woke corporations, the groomer corporations
[03:08:44.900 --> 03:08:48.780]  trying to bump up those ESG scores.
[03:08:48.780 --> 03:08:49.780]  Not going well for Target.
[03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:54.180]  I think they lost about $12 billion.
[03:08:54.180 --> 03:09:00.940]  Bud Light is just, they're just grasping for air, like the Titanic going down, like Bud
[03:09:00.940 --> 03:09:01.940]  Light.
[03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:03.580]  And they're still, guys, you see that in the news?
[03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:09.900]  Bud Light is still donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to pro-LGBTQ plus communities in
[03:09:09.900 --> 03:09:18.460]  the midst, in the midst of losing billions of dollars and a boycott over homosexual Dylan
[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:19.460]  Mulvaney.
[03:09:20.140 --> 03:09:21.140]  It's just so insane.
[03:09:21.140 --> 03:09:22.500]  These people are willing to die.
[03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:24.740]  They're willing to die in their depravity.
[03:09:24.740 --> 03:09:29.220]  They're willing to go down with the ship with their degeneracy because these people
[03:09:29.220 --> 03:09:32.060]  are about it.
[03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:37.220]  But the reality of what this month really is, I mean, at the end of the day, it doesn't
[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:39.700]  exist, right?
[03:09:39.700 --> 03:09:41.440]  Today is the day that the Lord has made.
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:43.940]  We will rejoice and we will be glad in it, right?
[03:09:43.940 --> 03:09:45.900]  So God owns the universe.
[03:09:45.900 --> 03:09:47.900]  Christ authored the universe.
[03:09:47.900 --> 03:09:56.100]  He's the author of time and space, mankind, everything inside and outside of time, multidimensional
[03:09:56.100 --> 03:09:57.900]  universe and world that we live in.
[03:09:57.900 --> 03:10:04.180]  Anything, the Bible makes it very clear, Christ has originated and created.
[03:10:04.180 --> 03:10:10.220]  But he's not the pioneer of wickedness and sin and also not the pioneer of lies.
[03:10:10.220 --> 03:10:11.940]  There are things that God cannot do.
[03:10:11.940 --> 03:10:15.740]  He cannot lie and he cannot sin.
[03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:18.300]  And he will not and cannot betray you.
[03:10:18.300 --> 03:10:20.700]  We betray him, but he will not betray us.
[03:10:20.700 --> 03:10:21.980]  Drew, what are you saying?
[03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:28.140]  What I'm saying is humanity is wicked and evil and degenerate and depraved.
[03:10:28.140 --> 03:10:33.740]  And they're branding an entire month dedicated to the one thing that embodies Lucifer from
[03:10:33.740 --> 03:10:34.740]  the very beginning.
[03:10:34.740 --> 03:10:35.740]  All right.
[03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:39.380]  So when you walk into a target, let me be honest with you.
[03:10:39.380 --> 03:10:44.100]  When you walk into a target, you walk into a Walmart, you walk into some corporate American
[03:10:44.460 --> 03:10:48.780]  ESG shill right in 2023.
[03:10:48.780 --> 03:10:55.260]  When you see all of this branding for Pride Month, we are proud in our sexuality and our
[03:10:55.260 --> 03:10:57.580]  degeneracy and spreading disease.
[03:10:57.580 --> 03:11:03.060]  When you walk into that target and you see those aisles, you see those dedicated little
[03:11:03.060 --> 03:11:07.500]  merchandise booths for this specific month, right?
[03:11:07.500 --> 03:11:12.620]  Not only are they ESG corporate shills that really don't care about anybody, they just
[03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:16.100]  utilize the minorities and they want to be good citizens of the new world order to bump
[03:11:16.100 --> 03:11:17.580]  that score up.
[03:11:17.580 --> 03:11:23.620]  But also when you walk into a target and you see that right there, targeting children,
[03:11:23.620 --> 03:11:26.260]  satanic clothing, right?
[03:11:26.260 --> 03:11:33.100]  Pride clothing designed for children that have lost their minds and that have been indoctrinated.
[03:11:33.100 --> 03:11:37.640]  That's not just some kind of dedicated aisle or spot for the LGBTQ plus.
[03:11:37.640 --> 03:11:42.880]  That is an altar to Satan, to Lucifer, all right?
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:46.560]  People ask themselves what idols look like in 2023, well I'll give you one.
[03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:51.240]  These people worship sex, they worship their sexual identity, what they call that, right?
[03:11:51.240 --> 03:11:55.720]  They worship their degeneracy and they're pushing it across corporate America because
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:12:03.200]  it's been tolerated, it's been normalized and now it's going after children, all right?
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:05.920]  Because the rainbow to begin with belongs to God, they stole that.
[03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:10.040]  They always have to just steal everything because they're never original.
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:11.800]  He's not an OG, he's not an original.
[03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:16.640]  The only thing he's an OG of according to the Bible that you see very, very clearly
[03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:21.160]  lies the father and the originator of lies, that's what Jesus said, and pride.
[03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:24.800]  That's what you see in the Bible, all right?
[03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:31.680]  And he plays on the lust of the flesh because he knows what sinful mankind will fall for
[03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:34.080]  and will be tempted by.
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:39.000]  But the one thing that is being normalized and tolerated right now is the one thing that
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:45.040]  is a total abomination, despicable in the eyes of God.
[03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:49.720]  God loves humanity, God wants to see people saved, that's what the gospel is.
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:54.400]  People have the opportunity to turn from their wickedness, all right?
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:57.360]  The born again Christian isn't going to sit here and say, well, I'm just not going to
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:01.760]  address sin because who am I to judge, no, no, no, no.
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:06.680]  The Bible says when Jesus Christ gave the great commission, all authority has been given
[03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:08.960]  unto me, all right?
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:13.280]  And I give it to you, all right, it's been given unto me, all authority that you may
[03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:17.480]  go out into the nations, make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:18.480]  the Holy Spirit.
[03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:20.360]  All right, you got to preach the gospel.
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:27.760]  The authority to speak on righteousness and godliness and the eternal reality of what's
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:33.200]  going to happen to mankind in terms of sin and fallen mankind, that doesn't come from
[03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:37.680]  Drew's authority, that doesn't come from the pastor's authority, that doesn't come from
[03:13:37.680 --> 03:13:39.920]  the human being's authority.
[03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:45.920]  All authority has been given unto Christ and we are born again and that's been passed on
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:46.920]  to us.
[03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:49.240]  We are the messengers, all right?
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:52.880]  We are the messengers and the message never changes.
[03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:58.760]  Yes, you must be above reproach, none of us are perfect, but that doesn't mean that we
[03:13:58.760 --> 03:14:04.920]  cuck out and we back down from speaking biblical truth to a fallen world that's going straight
[03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:07.000]  to hell.
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:08.760]  Do you really love people?
[03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:10.400]  Do you really love people?
[03:14:10.400 --> 03:14:15.040]  Do I really love people, all right?
[03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:18.440]  Open rebuke is better than concealed love.
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:24.640]  That means that you're willing to tell the solid, just sniper headshot right between
[03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:31.800]  the eyes truth that might hurt somebody's feelings, but it may save their soul.
[03:14:31.800 --> 03:14:35.560]  Is that the reality that I live?
[03:14:35.560 --> 03:14:39.240]  Is that where we really are right now in 2023?
[03:14:39.240 --> 03:14:44.260]  Are we just trying to tiptoe around with these cuckservatives and limp-wristed Christians
[03:14:44.260 --> 03:14:48.240]  that they just want to run around and never hurt anybody's feelings?
[03:14:48.240 --> 03:14:50.600]  They just want to be accepted by the new world order.
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:55.520]  We don't want to cause any problems, so what do we have to sacrifice theologically and give
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:15:00.200]  an appearance of godliness, but lack its power thereof, that's what the Bible says, so we
[03:15:00.200 --> 03:15:01.720]  can just be accepted.
[03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:08.480]  No, it's not about being accepted by the world, it's about making sure that you put your faith
[03:15:08.480 --> 03:15:14.660]  in Jesus to be accepted by the Father so your soul is saved and preaching that same heavenly
[03:15:14.660 --> 03:15:20.460]  message to a fallen world that needs the same thing.
[03:15:20.460 --> 03:15:27.300]  You see, we just sit here and we address the one thing in this American culture that needs
[03:15:27.300 --> 03:15:32.340]  to be addressed, that is sending people straight to hell.
[03:15:32.340 --> 03:15:38.640]  That is the reality of what is happening when you take a look at Pride Month, it is satanic
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:43.960]  Luciferian month, even the President of the United States, all these politicians and these
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:52.120]  woke corporations are pushing satanism, Luciferianism, they are pushing the devil on you, your family
[03:15:52.120 --> 03:15:53.120]  and your children.
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:54.120]  Stay away from it.
[03:15:54.120 --> 03:15:55.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:55.120 --> 03:16:11.760]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements because
[03:16:11.760 --> 03:16:13.880]  it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[03:16:13.880 --> 03:16:20.000]  So support InfoWarsStore, listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't
[03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:24.360]  know, I don't know, Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes
[03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:30.160]  and again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything, krill oil.
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:36.320]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements
[03:16:36.320 --> 03:16:40.920]  that will keep you alive and I would urge everyone, maybe you don't take vitamins, maybe
[03:16:40.920 --> 03:16:45.440]  you don't take nutritional supplements but the day will come, vitamin C and zinc, absolutely
[03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:50.720]  imperative for the cold, DNA force, absolutely imperative, mineral fusion, absolutely as
[03:16:50.720 --> 03:16:54.120]  you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[03:16:54.120 --> 03:16:57.200]  You have to have these products.
[03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:01.480]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:03.160]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:05.600]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful, it would never happen.
[03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:09.240]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money, they only had Tucker Carlson on the air because
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:12.400]  they believe they can control him but as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he
[03:17:12.400 --> 03:17:13.400]  was taken off the air.
[03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:18.680]  It's the same thing with Infowars but Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George
[03:17:18.680 --> 03:17:22.080]  Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:27.800]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners and when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:34.800]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros, I'm underwritten by you which
[03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:35.800]  is we the people.
[03:17:36.280 --> 03:17:39.680]  I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand, please
[03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:42.000]  don't take Infowars for granted.
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:43.280]  We're barely hanging on.
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:46.720]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great
[03:17:46.720 --> 03:17:49.080]  products at the same time at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:49.080 --> 03:17:53.640]  So don't procrastinate, go to Infowarsstore.com, get amazing products that keep us on the air
[03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:57.680]  and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:17:57.680 --> 03:18:03.080]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had, I don't think anybody can deny it
[03:18:03.280 --> 03:18:06.560]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:18:06.560 --> 03:18:12.560]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:18:12.560 --> 03:18:17.640]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight and when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen
[03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:23.240]  Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[03:18:23.240 --> 03:18:24.240]  just incredible.
[03:18:24.240 --> 03:18:28.040]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:18:28.040 --> 03:18:32.960]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on the air if you do not
[03:18:32.960 --> 03:18:33.960]  support us.
[03:18:33.960 --> 03:18:37.440]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:18:37.440 --> 03:18:42.320]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great
[03:18:42.320 --> 03:18:46.200]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on the air.
[03:18:46.200 --> 03:18:49.960]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:54.720]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems
[03:18:54.720 --> 03:18:55.720]  will be over.
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:18:56.720]  Please take action now.
[03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:01.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic
[03:19:01.040 --> 03:19:05.320]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future, that is a
[03:19:05.320 --> 03:19:06.320]  hellish future.
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:10.160]  Now you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:14.160]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores,
[03:19:14.160 --> 03:19:16.080]  Amazon or Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:16.080 --> 03:19:20.360]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we
[03:19:20.360 --> 03:19:24.200]  got run out and there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[03:19:24.200 --> 03:19:29.600]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:33.520]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:19:33.520 --> 03:19:37.360]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[03:19:37.360 --> 03:19:39.000]  you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:42.640]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:43.640]  copies.
[03:19:43.640 --> 03:19:47.920]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:52.680]  signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[03:19:52.680 --> 03:19:53.680]  local school.
[03:19:53.680 --> 03:19:54.680]  This is an Infowar.
[03:19:54.680 --> 03:20:04.520]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:17.920]  And we are back, I'm your guest host Drew Hernandez, want to invite you guys to subscribe
[03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:22.840]  and follow me on my personal Rumble channel, they're up on the screen right now or follow
[03:20:22.840 --> 03:20:27.520]  me on Twitter at Drew H Live, click that link in the bio so you can find all my bass transmissions,
[03:20:27.520 --> 03:20:32.680]  I stream about five days a week exclusively on Rumble, but as always you can find me here
[03:20:32.680 --> 03:20:38.280]  Thursdays during the fourth hour of the most banned transmission on the face of planet
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:40.200]  Earth, The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:40.200 --> 03:20:46.400]  Well here we are kicking off Groomer Month, kicking off Luciferian Month, because these
[03:20:46.400 --> 03:20:52.120]  people want to identify with pride, they want to identify with the heart of the serpent,
[03:20:52.120 --> 03:20:57.400]  the ancient dragon, the evil one, so of course these people are going to be serving their
[03:20:57.400 --> 03:21:02.800]  father the devil, and you're going to see this stuff going to overdrive, oh they sit
[03:21:02.800 --> 03:21:06.560]  there and say we just want to love and be loved and do what we want to do behind closed
[03:21:06.560 --> 03:21:11.920]  doors but you know just about a few years later they're going after children, alright,
[03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:18.960]  they're going after innocent kids with their degeneracy and hypersexual curriculums and
[03:21:18.960 --> 03:21:24.760]  showing children pornography and teaching them how to commit acts of sodomy against
[03:21:24.760 --> 03:21:29.360]  each other and lesbionage and of course, of course, of course, because the Bible made
[03:21:29.360 --> 03:21:35.360]  it very clear, when you enter into total depravity you enter humanity into what they
[03:21:35.360 --> 03:21:42.640]  call what God calls the reprobate mind, means you lose your mind entirely, no moral code,
[03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:51.360]  no sense of right or wrong, just totally full blown Lucifer worship, Satan worship, raping
[03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:58.240]  children and pushing all kinds of degeneracy left and right, alright, does that sound familiar,
[03:21:58.240 --> 03:22:02.320]  isn't it just so crazy to me, I mean I don't like to use the word crazy, I guess I use it
[03:22:02.320 --> 03:22:07.320]  in positive light but it's just so wild when you see the Bible and you take a look at
[03:22:07.320 --> 03:22:12.680]  your news cycle and you take a look at your world and it's like God was right and God
[03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:18.520]  will always be right, okay, like it's just, you can't get away from it, there's no confining
[03:22:18.560 --> 03:22:26.720]  this stuff, there's no confining it, mankind cannot confine sin, degeneracy and wickedness,
[03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:32.080]  there's no safe version of any of this stuff, you got to address it at some point just like
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:39.000]  every single human being has to address their own personal sin with a holy God, so must
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:45.760]  this community, so must this society and so must this nation because if it does not we
[03:22:45.760 --> 03:22:53.400]  will further plunge into judgment, America will not be blessed, I'm telling you man,
[03:22:53.400 --> 03:22:59.640]  America will not succeed against the new world order without Christ, without God and how
[03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:05.960]  do we do that, we submit to his principles whether it offends us or it offends a family
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:12.560]  member or whoever's closest to us, Jesus made it clear man, you must be able to forsake
[03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:16.160]  everyone even your own kids, your children, it doesn't mean that you just leave them
[03:23:16.160 --> 03:23:23.160]  by themselves, it just means that no one shall stand between you and Christ.
[03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:30.160]  And Christ said, those who really love me are those that obey me.
[03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:34.560]  Love for Christ is not some kind of emotional trip.
[03:23:34.560 --> 03:23:37.960]  It is simple obedience to his word.
[03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:38.960]  It's that simple, man.
[03:23:38.960 --> 03:23:40.400]  God doesn't make it that hard.
[03:23:40.400 --> 03:23:41.560]  God doesn't make it that hard.
[03:23:41.560 --> 03:23:48.320]  But here we are, here we are, 2023 groomer month, and they are kicking it off strong.
[03:23:48.320 --> 03:23:53.120]  Story number one, the U.S. Department of Education groomers telling children they got
[03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:57.160]  your back to kick off sodomy month.
[03:23:57.160 --> 03:23:58.280]  Oh, perfect timing.
[03:23:58.280 --> 03:23:59.280]  Would you look at that?
[03:23:59.280 --> 03:24:03.680]  They tweeted this this morning, U.S. Department of Education on Twitter.
[03:24:03.680 --> 03:24:09.360]  Everyone in the school community should feel valued for who they are and free to be their
[03:24:09.360 --> 03:24:11.380]  authentic self.
[03:24:11.380 --> 03:24:15.880]  And this is what the U.S. Department of Education is saying to kick off Pride Month.
[03:24:15.880 --> 03:24:23.800]  Our message to LGBTQI plus students, teachers and staff as we begin Hashtag Pride Month,
[03:24:23.800 --> 03:24:25.920]  ED has got your back.
[03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:27.640]  Oh, I bet you do.
[03:24:27.640 --> 03:24:28.640]  All right.
[03:24:28.640 --> 03:24:34.440]  I bet you the United States Department of Education during sodomy month has the backs
[03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:35.440]  of children.
[03:24:35.440 --> 03:24:38.120]  Does that make anybody comfortable?
[03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:43.080]  Like does that just not make you cringe, whether you're straight, gay, whatever, when you read
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:47.480]  something like that during Pride Month where there's a lot of sodomy going on, let's just
[03:24:47.480 --> 03:24:48.480]  be honest, man.
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:49.480]  That's what's going on.
[03:24:49.480 --> 03:24:50.680]  That's what's happening.
[03:24:50.680 --> 03:24:52.840]  They worship their sexual identity.
[03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:53.840]  That's what it represents.
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:54.920]  All right.
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:56.000]  Let's be adults here.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:57.160]  Let's be honest here.
[03:24:57.160 --> 03:24:59.160]  Don't get triggered and run away.
[03:24:59.160 --> 03:25:00.160]  All right.
[03:25:00.160 --> 03:25:05.680]  Isn't it crazy when you identify these people and you describe who they are and what they
[03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:07.880]  do, they just start getting triggered, even the conservatives.
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:09.880]  Oh, my God, that's so disrespectful.
[03:25:09.880 --> 03:25:13.320]  Drew, how could you say that about the sodomites?
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:14.640]  Don't describe what they do.
[03:25:14.640 --> 03:25:15.640]  That's gross.
[03:25:15.640 --> 03:25:18.920]  Yeah, I know, man.
[03:25:18.920 --> 03:25:19.920]  I know.
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:26.120]  But, of course, the United States Department of Education is telling children that they
[03:25:26.120 --> 03:25:28.120]  got their back.
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:36.280]  Oh, God, disgusting, uncomfortable, sus, you know what I mean?
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:39.760]  I mean, take a look at what's happening in California with our second story of the day,
[03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:41.640]  story number two.
[03:25:41.640 --> 03:25:42.640]  Newsom.
[03:25:42.640 --> 03:25:43.640]  All right.
[03:25:43.640 --> 03:25:50.400]  Governor Gavin Newsom is blasting parents opposing a kids school gay pride event as
[03:25:50.400 --> 03:25:52.160]  being far right.
[03:25:52.160 --> 03:25:56.880]  So their opposition towards a gay pride event for children.
[03:25:56.880 --> 03:25:58.240]  All right.
[03:25:58.240 --> 03:26:04.400]  Governor Gavin Newsom is coming out and saying that is just far right opposition.
[03:26:04.400 --> 03:26:08.560]  And he's saying that they're trying to eliminate the existence of minority communities.
[03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:10.400]  You see how this works?
[03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:12.840]  You see how these people do this?
[03:26:12.840 --> 03:26:18.320]  This is at the local, okay, governor's level in Los Angeles.
[03:26:18.320 --> 03:26:25.000]  If you're a parent and you take issue, all right, you take issue with some kind of pride
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:31.480]  night event at a school with children at a high school with minors.
[03:26:31.480 --> 03:26:38.300]  The governor of a woke state is going to come out and accuse you, mom, of being far right
[03:26:38.300 --> 03:26:41.300]  and trying to shut down minority communities.
[03:26:41.300 --> 03:26:45.980]  What does that mean according to the woke globalist satanic mindset?
[03:26:45.980 --> 03:26:52.460]  It means that you're a racist, you're a racist, you're homophobic, you're transphobic, whatever
[03:26:52.460 --> 03:26:55.180]  phobic name they come up with, right?
[03:26:55.180 --> 03:26:59.980]  It's all a psyop to just slander you in front of the entire population to make you look
[03:26:59.980 --> 03:27:06.900]  like you have leprosy and you can't be trusted and you deserve to be thrown in prison.
[03:27:06.900 --> 03:27:11.180]  And we know that DHS, the federal government has been putting out reports saying the same
[03:27:11.180 --> 03:27:18.100]  thing that they're anticipating attacks on LGBTQ events during pride month because people
[03:27:18.100 --> 03:27:22.580]  and parents are taking issue with LGBTQ plus curriculum in schools.
[03:27:22.580 --> 03:27:25.860]  Yeah, that includes stuff like this.
[03:27:25.860 --> 03:27:28.580]  So you will be designated as a terrorist.
[03:27:28.580 --> 03:27:31.780]  You'll be designated as a far right extremist.
[03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:34.980]  You'll be designated as a threat to democracy.
[03:27:34.980 --> 03:27:38.900]  If you guys, if you're a mom watching right now, I don't know, maybe you just found your
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:39.900]  way here.
[03:27:39.900 --> 03:27:41.220]  Maybe you just clicked a random link.
[03:27:41.220 --> 03:27:42.220]  Who knows?
[03:27:42.220 --> 03:27:43.780]  You don't even know who Alex Jones is.
[03:27:43.780 --> 03:27:45.980]  You don't know who Drew Hernandez is.
[03:27:45.980 --> 03:27:47.540]  You're not really into politics.
[03:27:47.540 --> 03:27:49.300]  You're not into any of this stuff.
[03:27:49.300 --> 03:27:52.900]  Maybe this is your red pill moment.
[03:27:52.900 --> 03:27:55.700]  It doesn't matter what your politics are, mom.
[03:27:55.700 --> 03:27:58.120]  It doesn't matter what you believe in, dad.
[03:27:58.120 --> 03:28:02.300]  It does not matter how in the gray area you are.
[03:28:02.300 --> 03:28:06.780]  It doesn't matter if you're totally neutral to any of these beliefs.
[03:28:06.780 --> 03:28:09.740]  I don't really want to pick a bone with the Christians.
[03:28:09.740 --> 03:28:12.980]  I don't really want to pick a bone with the sodomites.
[03:28:12.980 --> 03:28:15.860]  I just kind of want to live my life and do my own thing.
[03:28:15.860 --> 03:28:17.020]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:28:17.020 --> 03:28:19.560]  That's not how it works with these people.
[03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:26.100]  They will force you to make a decision because if you simply just put your children before
[03:28:26.100 --> 03:28:34.220]  the state, you put your children before the pedophile teachers in K-12, you just simply
[03:28:34.220 --> 03:28:38.060]  say this, I am the parent.
[03:28:38.060 --> 03:28:41.060]  You do not have any authority over my children.
[03:28:41.060 --> 03:28:43.180]  That is crossing the line for those people.
[03:28:43.180 --> 03:28:49.060]  You will be designated, regardless of your politics, alt-right, far-right, domestic right-wing
[03:28:49.060 --> 03:28:54.820]  extremist, a threat to the state, call CSP, Child Protective Services, and take the children.
[03:28:54.820 --> 03:28:57.620]  That's what these people do.
[03:28:57.620 --> 03:29:01.460]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of The
[03:29:01.460 --> 03:29:02.460]  Reiss Report.
[03:29:02.460 --> 03:29:06.140]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.

[03:29:14.540 --> 03:29:15.940]  Greg, what do you got there?
[03:29:15.940 --> 03:29:20.100]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[03:29:20.100 --> 03:29:24.980]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[03:29:24.980 --> 03:29:30.500]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[03:29:30.500 --> 03:29:32.020]  Absolutely.
[03:29:32.020 --> 03:29:37.060]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[03:29:37.060 --> 03:29:41.740]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?
[03:29:41.740 --> 03:29:44.820]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[03:29:44.820 --> 03:29:45.820]  Take out your phone.

[03:29:46.820 --> 03:29:48.980]  It'll take you directly to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:29:48.980 --> 03:29:49.980]  Buy something.
[03:29:49.980 --> 03:29:50.980]  Support the Infowars.
[03:29:50.980 --> 03:29:54.380]  Keep Alex Jones, Orrin Schroer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us
[03:29:54.380 --> 03:29:55.380]  on air.
[03:29:55.380 --> 03:29:56.380]  Do it today.
[03:29:56.380 --> 03:29:57.380]  Do it now.
[03:29:57.380 --> 03:29:58.380]  Support the Infowars.
[03:29:58.380 --> 03:30:04.700]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into
[03:30:04.700 --> 03:30:05.700]  the atmosphere.
[03:30:05.700 --> 03:30:08.620]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:30:08.620 --> 03:30:14.980]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to convert these gases
[03:30:14.980 --> 03:30:19.420]  into fluorosilicic acid, still highly toxic but containable.
[03:30:19.420 --> 03:30:24.220]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was no affordable way to
[03:30:24.220 --> 03:30:25.340]  dispose of it.
[03:30:25.340 --> 03:30:30.260]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who
[03:30:30.260 --> 03:30:33.740]  was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time.
[03:30:33.740 --> 03:30:40.260]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated industrial waste product
[03:30:40.260 --> 03:30:42.660]  and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:30:42.660 --> 03:30:47.940]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:30:47.940 --> 03:30:54.380]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a remedy to this madness.
[03:30:54.380 --> 03:30:56.500]  Available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:30:56.500 --> 03:31:02.500]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[03:31:02.500 --> 03:31:04.940]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:04.940 --> 03:31:08.220]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:08.220 --> 03:31:12.620]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:31:13.580 --> 03:31:16.580]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:16.580 --> 03:31:21.580]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every
[03:31:21.580 --> 03:31:26.580]  day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:31:26.580 --> 03:31:29.580]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:29.580 --> 03:31:34.580]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not
[03:31:34.580 --> 03:31:35.580]  support us.
[03:31:35.580 --> 03:31:39.580]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:31:39.740 --> 03:31:44.740]  Most viewers and listeners never go to InfowarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich
[03:31:44.740 --> 03:31:47.740]  and empower your life, all at the same time keeping us on air.
[03:31:47.740 --> 03:31:51.740]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:31:51.740 --> 03:31:56.740]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfowarsStore.com, our funding problems
[03:31:56.740 --> 03:31:57.740]  will be over.
[03:31:57.740 --> 03:31:58.740]  Please take action now.

[03:32:03.900 --> 03:32:10.900]  popular Tooth Whitening Coral Calcium Toothpaste, full of essential oils, back in stock at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:32:58.060 --> 03:33:05.220]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:07.500 --> 03:33:14.500]  These people are never going to stop, by the way.
[03:33:14.500 --> 03:33:20.500]  They can't. They can't let up. They can't let go.
[03:33:20.500 --> 03:33:23.500]  They can't control themselves.
[03:33:23.500 --> 03:33:27.500]  Because wickedness, sin, and degeneracy...
[03:33:27.500 --> 03:33:29.500]  I mean, the Bible is very clear.
[03:33:29.500 --> 03:33:32.500]  That's why the Apostle Paul said, you're a slave to sin.
[03:33:32.500 --> 03:33:35.500]  You've got to be freed. You have no control over this.
[03:33:35.500 --> 03:33:39.500]  There's no control. And especially on a societal level,
[03:33:39.500 --> 03:33:42.500]  with the grooming and the pedophilia,
[03:33:42.500 --> 03:33:47.500]  and the spread of STDs and all this nonsense that we're starting to see in our society,
[03:33:47.500 --> 03:33:50.500]  just the total deterioration from within, alright?
[03:33:50.500 --> 03:33:54.500]  I'll just be the guy to come out and just say it, you know? Whatever.
[03:33:54.500 --> 03:33:57.500]  It's going to take a Christian to really start saying this stuff.
[03:33:57.500 --> 03:33:59.500]  But there's other base Christians out there that are saying it.
[03:33:59.500 --> 03:34:04.500]  But we've all got to really unify and just start calling it for what it is, man.
[03:34:04.500 --> 03:34:07.500]  There's no confining it. There's no restricting it.
[03:34:07.500 --> 03:34:09.500]  You're not going to put a stop to it.
[03:34:09.500 --> 03:34:12.500]  Humans need God. They need Christ.
[03:34:12.500 --> 03:34:14.500]  We need the Holy Spirit, alright?
[03:34:14.500 --> 03:34:18.500]  And that can only be accessed through repentance,
[03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:21.500]  accessed through the Gospel, through what Christ has done on the cross, right?
[03:34:21.500 --> 03:34:23.500]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[03:34:23.500 --> 03:34:25.500]  You want to save your children?
[03:34:25.500 --> 03:34:27.500]  You go to Christ. You go to God.
[03:34:27.500 --> 03:34:30.500]  This is what America has to do.
[03:34:30.500 --> 03:34:31.500]  But, I mean, look at this.
[03:34:31.500 --> 03:34:34.500]  Look how painfully obvious this is.
[03:34:34.500 --> 03:34:37.500]  These people are kicking off Groomer Month,
[03:34:37.500 --> 03:34:40.500]  and they're not letting up at all because they can't.
[03:34:40.500 --> 03:34:44.500]  Bud Light goes down. Target goes down.
[03:34:44.500 --> 03:34:46.500]  Massive corporations go down.
[03:34:46.500 --> 03:34:50.500]  Boycotts are good, but it's going to take some real repentance.
[03:34:50.500 --> 03:34:53.500]  It's going to take America to really come back.
[03:34:53.500 --> 03:34:58.500]  Stop supporting, alright, all of these Luciferian simps.
[03:34:58.500 --> 03:35:00.500]  That's what they are. They're proxies of the devil.
[03:35:00.500 --> 03:35:02.500]  Proxies of the New World Order.
[03:35:02.500 --> 03:35:03.500]  That's what these people are.
[03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:07.500]  And, of course, they are going to go after the innocent.
[03:35:07.500 --> 03:35:09.500]  They have to go after children.
[03:35:09.500 --> 03:35:11.500]  They can't help it.
[03:35:11.500 --> 03:35:13.500]  They can't help it.
[03:35:13.500 --> 03:35:15.500]  And I'm not giving them a pass, saying,
[03:35:15.500 --> 03:35:17.500]  Oh, poor them. They can't help just being a pedophile.
[03:35:17.500 --> 03:35:20.500]  No, what I'm saying is, it's unrestricted.
[03:35:20.500 --> 03:35:21.500]  Stop giving it a pass.
[03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:23.500]  Stop trying to explain it away.
[03:35:23.500 --> 03:35:26.500]  Stop trying to beat around the bush and cucking out
[03:35:26.500 --> 03:35:28.500]  Stop calling it out for what it truly is.
[03:35:28.500 --> 03:35:31.500]  Because until we identify what this really is,
[03:35:31.500 --> 03:35:33.500]  there will be no solutions.
[03:35:33.500 --> 03:35:35.500]  There will be no change.
[03:35:35.500 --> 03:35:39.500]  It will just be listening to freaking Barack Obama on repeat.
[03:35:39.500 --> 03:35:42.500]  Change, change, change, change.
[03:35:42.500 --> 03:35:44.500]  And it only gets worse.
[03:35:44.500 --> 03:35:50.500]  Nothing but lies, mental illness, mental gymnastics.
[03:35:50.500 --> 03:35:53.500]  It's the society we live in, man.
[03:35:53.500 --> 03:35:55.500]  Don't you find it crazy that conservatives
[03:35:55.500 --> 03:35:57.500]  are always jumping through all these, doing these mental gymnastics,
[03:35:57.500 --> 03:36:00.500]  all these hoops just to try to explain away
[03:36:00.500 --> 03:36:02.500]  something that's so black and white in the Bible.
[03:36:02.500 --> 03:36:04.500]  Now, why don't we put a stop to that?
[03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:06.500]  Why don't we get based like Uganda?
[03:36:06.500 --> 03:36:07.500]  You know what I mean?
[03:36:07.500 --> 03:36:08.500]  Why don't we get based like Uganda?
[03:36:08.500 --> 03:36:10.500]  Just do what's necessary.
[03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:15.180]  Traditional marriage is necessary.
[03:36:15.180 --> 03:36:18.780]  If God is going to be honored, that's where things got to go, man.
[03:36:18.780 --> 03:36:23.780]  Call me a bigot, call me filled with hate, call me whatever you want.
[03:36:23.780 --> 03:36:27.900]  Because at the end of the day, I only care what God literally says about me.
[03:36:27.900 --> 03:36:32.500]  And if I'm in line with his word, then we good.
[03:36:32.500 --> 03:36:34.500]  Then we good.
[03:36:34.500 --> 03:36:38.660]  Well, here's our next story of the day.
[03:36:38.660 --> 03:36:42.940]  Our third story of the day, just to give you guys more example of how Groomer Month
[03:36:42.940 --> 03:36:51.260]  is kicking off strong, exclusive, school district tells gym teachers to wear gay flags, use
[03:36:51.260 --> 03:36:54.340]  preferred pronouns to make class more inclusive.
[03:36:54.340 --> 03:36:55.820]  Oh, would you look at that?
[03:36:55.820 --> 03:37:02.420]  A Colorado school district encouraged its physical education PE teachers to don LGBT
[03:37:02.420 --> 03:37:08.260]  pride gear and use preferred pronouns in an effort to display their support for the LGBTQ
[03:37:08.260 --> 03:37:12.780]  community, according to documents obtained by the Daily Caller Foundation through public
[03:37:12.780 --> 03:37:13.780]  records request.
[03:37:13.780 --> 03:37:19.740]  You know, the interesting thing is they could push all this degeneracy on children.
[03:37:19.740 --> 03:37:27.060]  But you say one word about Jesus, you quote one biblical passage to improve somebody's
[03:37:27.060 --> 03:37:28.060]  life.
[03:37:28.060 --> 03:37:33.820]  All the conservatives say, separation of church and state, oh, my God, how dare you tell a
[03:37:33.940 --> 03:37:38.700]  you know, something eternal that could lead them to the salvation of their soul.
[03:37:38.700 --> 03:37:41.460]  But it's OK if you push sodomy on them.
[03:37:41.460 --> 03:37:43.780]  That's fine, because it's not religious.
[03:37:43.780 --> 03:37:49.780]  Push the sodomy on the children because it's not religious.
[03:37:49.780 --> 03:37:50.780]  That's not oppressive.
[03:37:50.780 --> 03:37:54.260]  And then the pedophiles and the groomers come in with the blue and the green hair and the
[03:37:54.260 --> 03:37:55.260]  pink hair.
[03:37:55.260 --> 03:37:56.260]  I hate little kid.
[03:37:56.260 --> 03:37:57.260]  Hmm.
[03:37:57.260 --> 03:37:58.260]  It's groomer month.
[03:37:58.260 --> 03:37:59.260]  Are you ready?
[03:37:59.260 --> 03:38:00.260]  Are you ready to learn about gay sex?
[03:38:00.260 --> 03:38:01.260]  Are you ready?
[03:38:01.260 --> 03:38:03.060]  Are you ready to learn how to be a lesbian?
[03:38:03.300 --> 03:38:04.300]  Oh, little kid.
[03:38:04.300 --> 03:38:07.180]  Oh, you don't feel like you're actually your gender?
[03:38:07.180 --> 03:38:09.140]  I'm glad you asked.
[03:38:09.140 --> 03:38:12.860]  Let's talk about how you could chop your genitals off so you can feel better.
[03:38:12.860 --> 03:38:16.340]  So you don't kill yourself.
[03:38:16.340 --> 03:38:17.340]  All inclusive, right?
[03:38:17.340 --> 03:38:18.780]  No, no, no.
[03:38:18.780 --> 03:38:19.860]  That's Satan.
[03:38:19.860 --> 03:38:20.940]  That's what that is.
[03:38:20.940 --> 03:38:26.660]  That is Satan whispering, whispering and groping children.
[03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:34.679]  But like I said, until it's actually addressed, nothing's going to change.
[03:38:34.679 --> 03:38:36.240]  I'll give you a perfect example of this.
[03:38:36.240 --> 03:38:37.800]  Here's a viral video.
[03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:43.240]  If the team wants to cue this up, this is our fourth story of the day.
[03:38:43.240 --> 03:38:50.119]  California high school teacher instructs students on how to get pleasure from anal sex and to
[03:38:50.119 --> 03:38:52.759]  buy sex toys from Target.
[03:38:52.759 --> 03:38:53.759]  Take a look at this clip.
[03:38:54.759 --> 03:38:56.920]  ...is where the prostate is.
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:38:59.439]  So you don't have to go inside the booty hole.
[03:38:59.439 --> 03:39:06.199]  You can actually just push on the seam and that stimulates the prostate gland as well.
[03:39:06.199 --> 03:39:09.960]  And that, they apparently really like that.
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:17.039]  But yeah, so that's why for male and male, anal sex is still very pleasurable because
[03:39:17.039 --> 03:39:23.740]  of the fact that it hits the prostate and there's a lot of nerve endings in your booty as well.
[03:39:23.740 --> 03:39:29.580]  So the girls, the G-spot, prostate, they're the equivalent to each other.
[03:39:29.580 --> 03:39:35.820]  But apparently that's why if you ever see like, I mean, Target has them now.
[03:39:35.820 --> 03:39:36.820]  Sex toys.
[03:39:36.820 --> 03:39:40.300]  If you go to Target, seriously, if you go to Target and go where the Zampons and Pads
[03:39:40.300 --> 03:39:43.380]  are, they have, they just look like a little box.
[03:39:43.380 --> 03:39:46.300]  But if you open up the, there's like a Velcro front to the box.
[03:39:46.300 --> 03:39:48.820]  You open it up and then bam, sex toy.
[03:39:48.820 --> 03:39:55.699]  And you'll see them, CBS, yes, CBS has them too, a lot of them.
[03:39:55.699 --> 03:40:01.740]  And so, that's why when you look at the toys, a lot of them look like this.
[03:40:01.740 --> 03:40:05.060]  And the reason because is for finding...
[03:40:05.100 --> 03:40:14.100]  Oh! All giddy! All giddy! Hey kids! Hey! You want to learn about anal sex and sodomy?
[03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:19.100]  Ha ha ha! I'm glad you asked! Woo hoo! Did you know that, Target, you can find sex toys?
[03:40:19.100 --> 03:40:23.100]  Ha! You just gotta find them! Yeah, I know where to find them! I'll show you where to find them!
[03:40:23.100 --> 03:40:27.100]  So I can teach you guys how to use sex toys, little kids!
[03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:32.100]  Oh! CVS too! Ha ha ha! Woo hoo! Yay! Yay! Woo!
[03:40:32.100 --> 03:40:35.100]  Sodomy, children! Sodomy, children!
[03:40:35.100 --> 03:40:42.100]  Guys! Guys! This is insane! This is so insane!
[03:40:42.100 --> 03:40:48.100]  But this is what the groomers do! This is what they do! It's all inclusive! It's all inclusive!
[03:40:48.100 --> 03:40:56.100]  No, no! It's okay, guys! Guys! Guys! Hey! Relax! Relax! Alright? Relax!
[03:40:56.100 --> 03:41:05.100]  There's a reason for this! There's a reason why the teacher is explaining the children how to commit acts of sodomy against each other!
[03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:12.100]  And there's a reason why the teacher is leading the children how to find sex toys!
[03:41:12.100 --> 03:41:18.100]  Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't get mad! Don't get righteously angry, you bigot Christians!
[03:41:18.100 --> 03:41:25.100]  Come on, Mom and Dad! Don't you realize it's 2023 and this is just all about being inclusive?
[03:41:25.100 --> 03:41:33.100]  Don't you realize that this is just to make the gay little kids, just to make the little lesbian girls feel like they're okay too?
[03:41:33.100 --> 03:41:38.100]  Guys! Guys! Guys! You got it all wrong! You got it all wrong!
[03:41:38.100 --> 03:41:44.100]  This is just to make them feel acceptable! Don't you understand? Don't you understand?
[03:41:44.100 --> 03:41:46.100]  That's what this is about!
[03:41:46.100 --> 03:41:49.100]  No, I don't understand! I don't understand!
[03:41:49.100 --> 03:41:51.100]  There is no explanation!
[03:41:51.100 --> 03:41:53.100]  That's the depravity, you guys!
[03:41:53.100 --> 03:41:55.100]  That's what it looks like!
[03:41:55.100 --> 03:42:03.100]  Trying to explain away, teaching minors how to sodomize each other and use sex toys in the classroom!
[03:42:03.100 --> 03:42:06.100]  But I can't quote the Ten Commandments!
[03:42:08.100 --> 03:42:11.100]  Because that's evil! No, that's evil!
[03:42:11.100 --> 03:42:13.100]  You get your Jesus the hell out of there!
[03:42:13.100 --> 03:42:18.100]  That's evil! No, no! Jesus is evil, but sodomy is good in the classroom!
[03:42:18.100 --> 03:42:23.100]  Jesus is terrible, but sodomy is great to children in the classroom!
[03:42:23.100 --> 03:42:25.100]  Guys, this is what I'm talking about!
[03:42:25.100 --> 03:42:27.100]  Obviously I'm being sarcastic, okay?
[03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:30.100]  But this is exactly what I'm talking about!
[03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:32.100]  Alright?
[03:42:32.100 --> 03:42:35.100]  Like the Bible said, they will call good evil and evil good.
[03:42:35.100 --> 03:42:37.100]  It's totally backwards!
[03:42:37.100 --> 03:42:43.100]  Reprobate mind, lost their minds, and these people will sit there like I just animated
[03:42:43.100 --> 03:42:52.100]  and try to explain to a parent why it's okay to talk to their children about sodomy and using sex toys!
[03:42:52.100 --> 03:42:54.100]  To minors!
[03:42:54.100 --> 03:42:56.100]  Jesus, we need you!
[03:43:13.100 --> 03:43:17.100]  Chemicals, the most important component of the year is our Activated Charcoal Essential Oil Toothpaste as well!

[03:44:05.100 --> 03:44:10.100]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.

[03:44:57.100 --> 03:45:03.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[03:45:03.100 --> 03:45:06.100]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[03:45:06.100 --> 03:45:16.100]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[03:45:16.100 --> 03:45:29.100]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[03:45:29.100 --> 03:45:39.100]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:45:39.100 --> 03:45:41.100]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[03:45:41.100 --> 03:45:42.100]  You don't absorb it.
[03:45:42.100 --> 03:45:47.100]  We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:50.100]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:45:50.100 --> 03:45:53.100]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[03:45:53.100 --> 03:45:55.100]  X3, back in stock.
[03:45:55.100 --> 03:45:56.100]  Take action now.
[03:45:56.100 --> 03:45:57.100]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:45:57.100 --> 03:46:05.100]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth and they've got our children drinking that.
[03:46:05.100 --> 03:46:08.100]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[03:46:08.100 --> 03:46:09.100]  Period.
[03:46:09.100 --> 03:46:10.100]  Case closed.
[03:46:10.100 --> 03:46:11.100]  Out to get you and your family.
[03:46:11.100 --> 03:46:16.100]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour Group.
[03:46:16.100 --> 03:46:19.100]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:46:19.100 --> 03:46:25.100]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[03:46:25.100 --> 03:46:29.100]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:46:29.100 --> 03:46:32.100]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:46:32.100 --> 03:46:34.100]  But you can go paint two or three times.
[03:46:34.100 --> 03:46:36.100]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:46:37.100 --> 03:46:42.100]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[03:46:42.100 --> 03:46:47.100]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:46:47.100 --> 03:46:49.100]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:46:49.100 --> 03:46:51.100]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:46:51.100 --> 03:46:52.100]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:46:52.100 --> 03:46:55.100]  The point is you can get the filters at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:46:55.100 --> 03:46:56.100]  They're discounted right now.
[03:46:56.100 --> 03:46:57.100]  Finally back in stock.
[03:46:58.100 --> 03:47:02.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.100 --> 03:47:04.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.900 --> 03:47:18.260]  Well, I want to thank you guys for riding with me today, going straight into outer space,
[03:47:18.260 --> 03:47:19.260]  as we always do.
[03:47:19.260 --> 03:47:24.779]  This is the most banned show on the face of the globe, in the universe, on the internet,
[03:47:24.779 --> 03:47:26.180]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.180 --> 03:47:33.020]  I want to invite you guys to come watch my transmissions exclusively on Rumble.
[03:47:33.020 --> 03:47:38.100]  Just go type in Drew Hernandez, go download the Rumble app, or go type in Rumble.com.
[03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:41.340]  Type in Drew Hernandez in the search, you guys can subscribe to me there, I like to
[03:47:41.340 --> 03:47:42.340]  go live.
[03:47:42.340 --> 03:47:51.580]  I'll go live tonight at 10.30pm Pacific, excuse me, 10.30pm Eastern, that's 7.30pm Pacific.

[03:47:54.859 --> 03:47:56.460]  that good stuff.
[03:47:56.460 --> 03:47:57.699]  We get down, we get down.
[03:47:57.699 --> 03:47:58.699]  Just like we do here.
[03:47:58.699 --> 03:48:00.960]  We hold nothing back here, this is banned out video, right?
[03:48:00.960 --> 03:48:03.720]  This is InfoWars.
[03:48:03.720 --> 03:48:08.960]  So just to prove my point even further, with these groomers and these degenerates, that
[03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:12.039]  they just cannot resist going after children.
[03:48:12.039 --> 03:48:16.279]  Not because they're victims and they're minor attracted persons, or they're youth attracted
[03:48:16.279 --> 03:48:21.760]  persons with a sickness, oh, that needs to be cured, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:48:21.760 --> 03:48:29.119]  These are degenerate, wicked, sick perverts, alright, that try to justify their obviously
[03:48:29.119 --> 03:48:35.480]  unhealthy attraction, pedophilic attraction to children, and they hide behind the flag
[03:48:35.480 --> 03:48:37.279]  while they're doing so.
[03:48:37.279 --> 03:48:41.440]  Wolves in sheep's clothing, talk about real wolves in sheep's clothing, right?
[03:48:41.440 --> 03:48:48.760]  Like for real, educators, people that are meant to be trusted, figures in the community, where
[03:48:48.760 --> 03:48:52.240]  else would a demon hide, right?
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:48:59.920]  And the Bible says that the devil masquerades as an angel of light, it's a deception.
[03:48:59.920 --> 03:49:06.800]  The bad guy puts a costume on that looks like the good guy, right?
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:11.640]  It's quite literally that, that's what these people, so of course, Satan's gonna infiltrate
[03:49:11.640 --> 03:49:19.720]  teachers, gonna infiltrate these positions in society, alright, where they get proxies
[03:49:19.720 --> 03:49:24.880]  to be, you know, pushing their agenda, pushing their degeneracy, but they will be in positions
[03:49:24.880 --> 03:49:30.920]  of power, they will be in positions of trust to the public, so that they can target the
[03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:31.920]  innocent.
[03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:37.580]  That's what this is all about, warping and raping a child, not only their mind, but literally
[03:49:37.580 --> 03:49:41.400]  them physically, and they hide behind what?
[03:49:41.400 --> 03:49:48.800]  The rainbow that belongs to God, but they are trying to redefine with anti-God's original
[03:49:48.880 --> 03:49:54.080]  design for biological procreation, traditional marriage, alright?
[03:49:54.080 --> 03:50:00.080]  This is an attack on God, you wanna call yourself a Christian, you gotta address this stuff,
[03:50:00.080 --> 03:50:05.119]  you wanna win the culture war, you gotta really push back on this stuff, you really wanna
[03:50:05.119 --> 03:50:10.600]  be walking with God and be blessed with God, I can guarantee you, this issue is at the
[03:50:10.600 --> 03:50:18.199]  forefront of everything for God, because it's at the forefront of our entire existence, alright?
[03:50:18.199 --> 03:50:21.680]  As a human race, alright?
[03:50:21.680 --> 03:50:25.400]  This is at the forefront of everything.
[03:50:25.400 --> 03:50:30.199]  There's never a blessing for going against God, but there's always a blessing for submitting
[03:50:30.199 --> 03:50:31.760]  to God.
[03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:33.400]  It's that simple.
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:38.359]  But like I said, to prove my point, because these pedophiles can't resist themselves,
[03:50:38.359 --> 03:50:44.279]  let's queue up video 2, if the team has video 2 there, this is a teacher, oh, an LGBTQ plus
[03:50:44.279 --> 03:50:49.640]  ally teacher, oh yes, so great, so inclusive and great, saying that he celebrates pride
[03:50:49.640 --> 03:50:58.000]  month at school by selling trans and progress flags, pride flags, which hopefully lead
[03:50:58.000 --> 03:51:01.600]  to conversations, would you look at that?
[03:51:01.600 --> 03:51:02.600]  Take a look.
[03:51:02.600 --> 03:51:04.199]  It's almost pride month.
[03:51:04.199 --> 03:51:08.320]  Unfortunately, our high school year ends just before June begins.
[03:51:08.320 --> 03:51:10.960]  What's a gender and sexuality alliance sponsored to do?
[03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:15.600]  Our club members wanted a day to feel prideful near the end of the year, so we came up with
[03:51:15.600 --> 03:51:16.920]  the day of love.
[03:51:16.920 --> 03:51:21.600]  The focus of the day of love is simple, to broadcast a message of support and positivity
[03:51:21.600 --> 03:51:27.080]  about our school's LGBTQ population in a fun way, and maybe we can start a few productive
[03:51:27.080 --> 03:51:28.880]  conversations along the way.
[03:51:28.880 --> 03:51:32.920]  From year to year, depending on the size of our membership, we've done a variety of activities
[03:51:32.920 --> 03:51:38.400]  throughout the day of love, but at its most basic, we sell pride flags and crafts, have
[03:51:38.400 --> 03:51:41.680]  productive conversations, and celebrate.
[03:51:41.680 --> 03:51:43.960]  Today let's talk about selling flags and crafts.
[03:51:43.960 --> 03:51:48.440]  Small pride flags are easy to order online, and you can sell them for like a dollar, but
[03:51:48.440 --> 03:51:50.080]  the profit isn't the point.
[03:51:50.080 --> 03:51:54.039]  The point is to give the people in your building an opportunity to display their support for
[03:51:54.039 --> 03:51:56.560]  the community in a highly visible way.
[03:51:56.560 --> 03:52:01.039]  Besides the progressive pride flag, I let our members decide what kind of pride flags
[03:52:01.039 --> 03:52:03.520]  that they wanted to order on our limited budget.
[03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:10.800]  So this year we have classic, progressive pride, pan, trans, bi, and the updated lesbian
[03:52:10.800 --> 03:52:11.800]  flag.
[03:52:11.800 --> 03:52:15.520]  I like to send out a Google form for my colleagues who can't make it down to the cafeteria where
[03:52:15.520 --> 03:52:17.240]  the day of love is happening.
[03:52:17.240 --> 03:52:19.920]  That way our flags can make it all over the school.
[03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:23.080]  When possible, I also like to sell crafts that our members make.
[03:52:23.080 --> 03:52:28.880]  And this year, oh my god, we have little pride frogs that have, oh my gosh, this is amazing,
[03:52:28.880 --> 03:52:29.880]  I'm going to buy them all.
[03:52:29.880 --> 03:52:31.320]  I'm not going to be able to wait.
[03:52:31.320 --> 03:52:36.600]  And we have the flag sales in a central location in our cafeteria so that people come in, and
[03:52:36.600 --> 03:52:39.560]  then that's where part two can happen, the conversations.
[03:52:40.700 --> 03:52:57.700]  Okay, number one, number one. Okay, so the gays are using gay frogs. You can't make this stuff up. The gays are using gay frogs to promote homosexuality to children at school.
[03:52:57.700 --> 03:53:17.700]  Didn't Alex Jones talk about this years ago? Wasn't he demonized for reporting on the fact that they're turning the frogs gay? And now the gays are using gay frogs to promote gayness and homosexuality and sodomy to little kids. You cannot make this stuff up.
[03:53:17.700 --> 03:53:42.700]  The gays are turning the frogs gay. Holy crap. This is so unbelievable. Oh, but Alex Jones was demonized, slandered, looked to make crazy because of legitimate studies going on with amphibians turning homosexual. But here we are. Fast forward. Alex Jones is right again. The gays are turning the frogs gay. You just cannot make this up.
[03:53:42.700 --> 03:54:07.700]  Jeez, dude. Anyways, it just defeats the purpose. This is just one big joke, isn't it? Don't you guys just sit here? Is someone playing a really sick joke on me? This can't possibly be real. This can't possibly be the reality that I live in. Do I really live in this reality? Am I really in this generation?
[03:54:07.700 --> 03:54:36.700]  God, did you really put me here? I'm not complaining like a cuck. I'm just saying, damn, dude. You know what I mean? Don't you ever just feel that way? I'm not complaining. I'm never going to back down. I'm just saying sometimes you see stuff like that. And this is just one big sick joke. This is just one gigantic, sick, twisted joke. You cannot make this stuff up. The gays turning the frogs gay to promote gayness to little gay kids at school.
[03:54:36.700 --> 03:55:05.700]  We're just children. I'm at a loss for words. I really don't know what to say. But anyways, it's interesting when you see these degenerates. They're open about it, right? Oh, we're going to take our pride flags. We are going to use this imagery. I pass it around all the kids at school in hopes of what? Doesn't stop there. Not to just promote our identity. Not to just be proud of who we are and our sodomy and our whatever.
[03:55:06.700 --> 03:55:28.700]  Whatever they're identifying as furries and animals and bestiality, this stuff just never stops, right? No, it doesn't stop there. They don't just want representation and to be seen. No, they openly say the quiet part out loud because they can't help themselves. They could never help themselves. You can't confine it.
[03:55:28.700 --> 03:55:57.700]  So they come out and they say, well, we hope that this is meant to lead to conversations. Oh, what kind of conversations? What kind of conversations? Huh? Conversations about what? Teacher? Sodomy with a little kid? Lesbianage with a little kid? Huh? You want to turn a little girl into a scissorer? Are these the kind of conversations you're having with minors? Huh, groomer? Okay, groomer. Okay, groomer. Yeah, yeah.
[03:55:57.700 --> 03:56:26.700]  You're totally just using this to just have some kind of conversation about what? What is there to talk about when you're promoting degeneracy and all kind of sexual identities? All of these identities have to do with sex acts. Okay. And sexual attractions. So you wave that damn flag at school. You're pushing all your pedophilia. All right. It's like candy. Oh, look at little kid. You want some candy?
[03:56:27.700 --> 03:56:56.700]  Come over to my ice cream truck. Hey, come over here. I'm in my big gay rainbow ice cream truck. Come over here. I got some tasty flavors for you.

Let's have a conversation about your sexuality. Little girl.
[03:56:56.700 --> 03:57:16.700]  Are you a little boy? Are you attracted to other little boys or are you a little boy? And do you think that you're actually a little girl, but you're attracted to little boys? So that just means that you're trans. So now let's discuss chopping your genitals off. Mommy and daddy won't do that, will they? Mommy and daddy like Jesus.
[03:57:17.700 --> 03:57:38.700]  Hey, shh. Don't tell them. But you can come to my house and we can further talk about this and your sexual identity. Because mom and dad are bigots and they like Trump and Jesus. So they hate you and they want you to kill yourself. So come to my house and then we'll really have some fun.

I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right. Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades. Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[03:59:22.700 --> 03:59:39.700]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second. You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
