[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.500 --> 00:09.500]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.500 --> 00:31.500]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[00:31.500 --> 00:44.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. We're here. We're live. It is Sunday, the 7th day of October 2012.
[00:44.500 --> 00:50.500]  And we are going to be live here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[00:50.500 --> 00:57.500]  And back weekdays, of course, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, that's 12 and 3 p.m. Eastern.
[00:57.500 --> 01:06.500]  Look, we talk about this quite a bit and we talk about it to the point of it becoming almost passÃ©.
[01:06.500 --> 01:15.500]  And just some known quantity, an axe hanging above our head, a sort of Damocles hanging above our head.
[01:15.500 --> 01:20.500]  And then we just get accustomed to it being there. We become fatigued to it. We become acclimated.
[01:20.500 --> 01:30.500]  We become prepared, accepting. It becomes a foregone conclusion, a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:30.500 --> 01:40.500]  And it doesn't need to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. We don't need to be mindless spectators that just sit here and let history roll over us.
[01:40.500 --> 01:45.500]  In fact, I keep saying this. You guys keep giving it to me and I keep not covering it on air.
[01:45.500 --> 01:55.500]  You guys print me the Carl Rove History's Actors quote. It was in The New York Times originally, but just New York Times magazine.
[01:55.500 --> 02:03.500]  But it's quoted everywhere, just the part about they control reality. They'll tell us up is down one day and then sideways is down the next.
[02:03.500 --> 02:11.500]  And we'll just believe whatever they say. And yes, if you just sit there and watch television, read the newspaper and don't see them contradicting day to day.
[02:11.500 --> 02:20.500]  Don't see them completely spinning facts. And don't see that there's a public authoritarian agenda going on. You're living in another world.
[02:20.500 --> 02:28.500]  But when I say that we've gotten used to this tyranny, I know I have. Even as by increments, it gets worse and worse.
[02:28.500 --> 02:38.500]  And we become accustomed to now FEMA admitting FEMA camps, admitting reeducation centers, admitting the Rural Affairs Council, the Council of Governors,
[02:38.500 --> 02:49.500]  admitting the gun confiscation plans, the 1.6 billion bullets, the mass grave preparations that we talked about three years ago.
[02:49.500 --> 02:55.500]  We had different county managers and others on and even disguise their voices on air.
[02:55.500 --> 03:04.500]  One from Indiana where they were told prepare for a million dead out of Chicago because they're just 30 miles or so from Chicago.
[03:04.500 --> 03:09.500]  They're on that part of Indiana. And now here it is in Congress.
[03:09.500 --> 03:17.500]  It's passed the House is going to the Senate to codify and fund a preparation for tens of millions of dead.
[03:17.500 --> 03:24.500]  And this story went up Friday afternoon. I've asked Kurt Nemo to repost it up at the top of info wars.com.
[03:24.500 --> 03:33.500]  That's being done right now because some stories come out and just don't get the attention they need. They deserve FEMA to mobilize for mass fatality planning.
[03:33.500 --> 03:39.500]  Bill mandates federal agency to respond to funeral homes, cemeteries and mortuaries being overwhelmed.
[03:39.500 --> 03:42.500]  And that's what we got three years ago was the secret reports.
[03:42.500 --> 03:49.500]  They were getting the funeral homes ready to be federalized and even small cemeteries to hold hundreds of thousands.
[03:49.500 --> 04:02.500]  And then we had the reports coming from all over the country, internal memorandum, not secret but restricted from the different state cemetery regulators from New York to Texas.
[04:02.500 --> 04:09.500]  We were called conspiracy theorists and it was all a big lie. None of it was true. Of course, here it all is now confirming it.
[04:09.500 --> 04:15.500]  So the point is, why is all this being ratcheted up? I mean, some continuity of government's always going on, especially in the Cold War.
[04:15.500 --> 04:21.500]  But this is many magnitudes bigger. So what is the big mobilization and preparation for?
[04:21.500 --> 04:27.500]  I'll be breaking that down, tying it into the designed world financial meltdown that is being engineered.
[04:27.500 --> 04:32.500]  And the fact that there's a war now between Turkey and Syria.
[04:32.500 --> 04:37.500]  It's been a covert war for a while, but now it's getting a lot hotter and a lot more public.
[04:37.500 --> 04:46.500]  And Panetta, the head of the CIA, has come out and said this could turn into a wider giant war, which is exactly what I've been saying.
[04:46.500 --> 04:51.500]  But I'm just saying, well, there's all these wars, but I'm the bad fairmonger. We all know that.
[04:51.500 --> 04:53.500]  Actually, everything's fine in the global economy.
[04:53.500 --> 04:58.500]  The police were saying in Detroit, though, don't visit because it's a war zone and they can't protect you.
[04:58.500 --> 04:59.500]  But, you know...
[04:59.500 --> 05:02.500]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[05:02.500 --> 05:04.500]  But not all silver is equal.
[05:04.500 --> 05:11.500]  Silver Soul is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[05:11.500 --> 05:14.500]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[05:14.500 --> 05:22.500]  Silver Soul resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[05:22.500 --> 05:29.500]  Silver Soul is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[05:29.500 --> 05:35.500]  It can be used internally as well as topically and is highly effective against viruses, bacteria, molds, and yeasts.
[05:35.500 --> 05:41.500]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with supernatural silver.
[05:41.500 --> 05:47.500]  Silver Soul liquid and gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school, or work.
[05:47.500 --> 05:51.500]  Go to supernaturalsilver.com and be prepared for any emergency.

[06:24.500 --> 06:36.500]  It is Sunday, the 7th day of October 2012.
[06:36.500 --> 06:46.500]  I'm Alex Jones, your host coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, now FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas.
[06:46.500 --> 06:50.500]  I love America. I love liberty. I love freedom. I love Texas.
[06:50.500 --> 06:54.500]  I love our constitutional republic. I'm a constitutionalist.
[06:54.500 --> 07:01.500]  I believe in rule of law, due process, the family, private property, and the good Lord above.
[07:01.500 --> 07:16.500]  The Second Amendment and the right to defend yourself and all the basic bedrock cannons of our constitutional republic founded on July 4th, 1776.
[07:16.500 --> 07:23.500]  That is why I've been listed by Homeland Security and leaked and declassified documents as a terrorist.
[07:23.500 --> 07:45.500]  That is why I have been listed as one of the main threats, quote, to the federal government because the federal government itself has been taken over by foreign banking cartels that brag that they've conquered Europe and the United States through derivatives fraud publicly in the Associated Press Reuters Time Magazine Newsweek.
[07:45.500 --> 08:01.500]  CNBC, the Financial Times of London, we've played the clips here, we've read the articles, where they brag and declare in our face that we are slaves and that they are bringing in a private global corporate monopoly capitalist mafia government.
[08:01.500 --> 08:12.500]  And so I've drawn my line in the sand. I have committed to stand up and speak out against these people and to mobilize against this evil.
[08:12.500 --> 08:31.500]  I recognize it historically. They've declared it. I see the general public in a zombie-like trance, and I'm here, along with our wonderful listeners, activists for freedom, attempting to shake the sleeping giant that is free humanity, not just America from its slumber.
[08:31.500 --> 08:49.500]  It is Sunday. It is October 7th, 2012, and we have massive news on the economy and the designed QE unlimited meltdown that will accelerate now. The social unrest exploding across Europe now moving to the United States with the media is keeping it quiet.
[08:49.500 --> 09:04.500]  Though, enter at your own risk, police union says war like Detroit is unsafe for visitors. Other cities are seeing similar situations. That's WWJ television reporting that.
[09:04.500 --> 09:13.500]  We're going to be breaking that down. You're going to see more of that in the future. Crime rates are exploding. The Justice Department has even had to admit that.
[09:13.500 --> 09:28.500]  Many cities have had to admit it. Remember, we're seeing cooked numbers because they want to try to have those numbers be a lot lower, but you need to know, folks, you better lock your house, you better carry a firearm, and you'd better watch your six because crime is absolutely going bonkers.
[09:28.500 --> 09:43.500]  A lot more police are getting killed. Police are getting more paranoid and shot five innocent people unarmed in the last few days, including a veteran in the current National Guard person with no criminal record in New York. They say he cut him off.
[09:43.500 --> 09:50.500]  They pulled him over and killed him. Just a lot of craziness going on out there. We're going to be breaking it all down today.
[09:50.500 --> 10:04.500]  Turkey is now in today what five shelling its neighbor, Syria. Turkey has more conventional arms than even Israel and is a serious member of NATO.
[10:04.500 --> 10:23.500]  And they have been bringing in the last nine months at least when they debate the numbers. 40 to 50,000 al-Qaeda jihadis out of Saudi Arabia and other areas US troops are on record. They're training the jihadis. Many of them wear the black al-Qaeda uniform and the black al-Qaeda patch.
[10:23.500 --> 10:38.500]  We have videos of that up at infowars.com. FSA rebel leader. We won't stop until al-Qaeda flag is raised over the White House. Well, you're running out of the White House, so no need. That's already done. Al-Qaeda was founded by Western intelligence in 1979.
[10:38.500 --> 10:53.500]  He's the guy that did it. So there you have it. They are blowing up churches, blowing up mosques, blowing up the oldest outdoor market in the world, a World Heritage site. You can look all this up.
[10:53.500 --> 11:02.500]  They are admittedly bragging on camera with family cell hostage that they will kill the children if the father doesn't go truck bomb the local police station.
[11:02.500 --> 11:17.500]  Our criminal government has never, this publicly, engaged in crimes like this. Our government and NATO and the UN, they're all run by the same megabanks, are publicly turning Libya over al-Qaeda to engage in ethnic cleansing.
[11:17.500 --> 11:33.500]  They are publicly, in nine months, just absolutely bombing military bases, blowing up the police stations, throwing families on video off the roofs of their houses, going house to house, just murdering en masse.
[11:33.500 --> 11:49.500]  With NATO, special forces, that means U.S. special forces. You notice when troops get killed now, they don't say U.S. troops in Afghanistan, they say NATO forces. And NATO forces are, this is L.A. Times, Reuters, look it up, British SAS, put it on screen.
[11:49.500 --> 12:07.500]  We're also streaming video at prisonplanet.tv and link through at infowars.com. You type in western special forces or MI6 or CIA commanding the Free Syrian Army, who even the Red Cross has had to admit about half of them are al-Qaeda.
[12:07.500 --> 12:19.500]  And the CFR two months ago said, we need al-Qaeda, that was the quote, and how they're really doing a good job, attacking preemptively Syria to overthrow a government who hasn't attacked anybody.
[12:19.500 --> 12:39.500]  This is amazing. And I know I talk a lot about this, but now last Thursday, some small mortars reportedly were fired out of Syria to the south that is being attacked by Turkey, pumping in al-Qaeda, trained by NATO and armed right there.
[12:39.500 --> 12:50.500]  And with even anti-aircraft missiles, you name it. They're also bringing in the anti-aircraft missiles, 10,000 of them, at least 2,000 radar or heat seeking, that's admitted out of Libya.
[12:50.500 --> 13:04.500]  That's al-Qaeda, our government giving them all the weapons Libya had, bringing them in to the area of southern Turkey and then injecting them into Syria.
[13:04.500 --> 13:16.500]  And they came out Thursday night and said, Turkey has apologized, or excuse me, Syria has apologized, for firing a couple mortars into civilian areas in Turkey.
[13:16.500 --> 13:23.500]  In which they have not been responding, they've not been attacking, even though they've been pointing out al-Qaeda's being brought in, because they know Turkey's got a much bigger military.
[13:23.500 --> 13:34.500]  And then Turkey came out and lied and said that Syria had admittedly said they'd attacked them and apologized. Of course, it turned out that wasn't true by Friday.
[13:34.500 --> 13:46.500]  And Syria said al-Qaeda is firing back in as a false flag, that the Pentagon and others have been openly talking about, to have an excuse to then have Turkey go into Syria.
[13:46.500 --> 14:00.500]  And more mortars were fired today. So Turkey is just blasting Syria right now and opening up an even larger wedge to inject more fighters.
[14:00.500 --> 14:11.500]  Imagine, a country is training and massing al-Qaeda jihadis, mainly out of Saudi Arabia, Wahhabist, to inject them into the secular government run system.
[14:11.500 --> 14:21.500]  There were the diverse groups of Jews, Christians, Muslims, Sunnis, Shiite, Alawites, and they are just murdering and killing any Christians or Jews they find.
[14:21.500 --> 14:27.500]  It's on the news in Europe, blowing up churches. It is unbelievable.
[14:27.500 --> 14:37.500]  And we are told that we've got to give up all our rights because al-Qaeda is hiding under every, you know, bed, every desk, every closet, has an al-Qaeda jihadist.
[14:37.500 --> 14:48.500]  And so TSA has got to go in your pants, got to go into your wife's bra, got to drag your children off to a private abuse room because al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[14:48.500 --> 14:52.500]  But al-Qaeda publicly works for the mega banks that run NATO and our government.
[14:52.500 --> 14:58.500]  And it's just hiding in plain view and the government thinks you're so stupid and I'm so stupid that they're doing all of this.
[14:58.500 --> 15:05.500]  Now, I'm going to cover that more in the second hour today and I'm going to cover, they want to make flu shots mandatory.
[15:05.500 --> 15:12.500]  And two states have already moved to make it to law. In fact, it's now been done in Rhode Island.
[15:12.500 --> 15:16.500]  They tried to make it to law but it failed a few years ago in Massachusetts.
[15:16.500 --> 15:26.500]  So this is a big deal because then the big vaccine makers can just mandate, buy off your politicians and then force you to buy their product.
[15:26.500 --> 15:28.500]  Just like they force you to buy government healthcare.
[15:28.500 --> 15:31.500]  And you know the nightmares of these big pharma companies, that's coming up.
[15:31.500 --> 15:37.500]  But first, when we return, I'm going to bring up a topic that is ultimately important.
[15:37.500 --> 15:43.500]  This is up at infowars.com, link through to the White House website, dovetrack.us.
[15:43.500 --> 15:48.500]  FEMA can mobilize for mass fatality planning. Millions of dead Americans.
[15:48.500 --> 15:54.500]  And it ties into the Army now not running patrols but regular checkpoints all over the United States.
[15:54.500 --> 15:56.500]  We'll be breaking that down.
[15:56.500 --> 16:03.500]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[16:03.500 --> 16:09.500]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at infowars.com.
[16:09.500 --> 16:16.500]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[16:16.500 --> 16:21.500]  And that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at infowars.com.
[16:21.500 --> 16:26.500]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[16:26.500 --> 16:29.500]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

[16:40.500 --> 16:44.500]  We're also carrying behind-the-green-mask, U.N. Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[16:44.500 --> 16:47.500]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[16:47.500 --> 16:51.500]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen,
[16:51.500 --> 16:54.500]  exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[16:54.500 --> 16:59.500]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[16:59.500 --> 17:03.500]  Sick of the globalist, you genesis control freaks adding poison to your water

[18:32.500 --> 18:35.500]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[18:35.500 --> 18:36.500]  But here's some good news.

[20:18.500 --> 20:20.500]  We are on the march.
[20:20.500 --> 20:23.500]  The empire is on the run.
[20:23.500 --> 20:28.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[20:32.500 --> 20:39.500]  You probably noticed in the last few years that when you watch the Kentucky Derby or the Super Bowl,
[20:39.500 --> 20:43.500]  you see regular army and Marines searching people.
[20:43.500 --> 20:49.500]  You may have tried to go to a kite festival in Austin, Texas and seen the National Guard out there.
[20:49.500 --> 20:55.500]  You might have gone to the San Antonio Riverwalk and seen Air Force MPs out,
[20:55.500 --> 21:00.500]  not just keeping an eye out for the Air Force people that might be drunk.
[21:00.500 --> 21:02.500]  No, for you.
[21:02.500 --> 21:05.500]  You might have seen US troops up in Canada when they had the Olympics,
[21:05.500 --> 21:12.500]  quote, helping to control the Canadians or Canadian troops over here at large events.
[21:12.500 --> 21:21.500]  Well, here's an article military police used for crowd control in South Carolina by Kurt Nemo and it links through to WISTV.
[21:21.500 --> 21:29.500]  And it was also reported local newspaper that says MPs are just helping set up checkpoints and searching people.
[21:29.500 --> 21:37.500]  Now, it's illegal for police to do that, though they still just keep doing it and doing it no matter how many times the courts throw it out in most states.
[21:37.500 --> 21:38.500]  They don't care.
[21:38.500 --> 21:40.500]  It's just our money they use when they lose them.
[21:40.500 --> 21:42.500]  And the excuses we're keeping you safe.
[21:42.500 --> 21:44.500]  I mean, after all, al-Qaeda is out there.
[21:44.500 --> 21:49.500]  Of course, now we're told it was in documents a decade ago, but now it's public that, oh, it's not about al-Qaeda.
[21:49.500 --> 21:54.500]  It's about gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, but number one enemy.
[21:54.500 --> 21:55.500]  You know it.
[21:55.500 --> 21:59.500]  You've heard it on the news when we broke the documents that a federal marshal gave me.
[21:59.500 --> 22:03.500]  State police officer gave me some of the others four years ago, three and a half years ago.
[22:03.500 --> 22:08.500]  You remember who's the number one terrorist returning veterans?
[22:08.500 --> 22:14.500]  Because they may have actually read the Constitution and they're not afraid to stand up for themselves.
[22:14.500 --> 22:22.500]  And well, they know they've been injected with deadly vaccines and they know that the government's trying to take their second amendment saying they all have PTSD.
[22:22.500 --> 22:25.500]  And oh, they're the number one enemy, but.
[22:25.500 --> 22:38.500]  But it's okay though, because the troops that are currently in their training to confiscate your guns and we have links to all this in these articles where it came out what three months ago, the army manual that says reeducation camps.
[22:38.500 --> 22:44.500]  If you don't believe me, just type in army manual for reeducation camps even uses the name reeducation camps.
[22:44.500 --> 22:46.500]  That's not us using that term.
[22:46.500 --> 22:52.500]  They even use the Soviet term with all the horror that's associated with it.
[22:52.500 --> 23:01.500]  And when I covered it, they had an army spokeswoman, very high level of Colonel come out and she put a press release out from one of the bases.
[23:01.500 --> 23:02.500]  You can go pull it up.
[23:02.500 --> 23:06.500]  It's in our articles and said, well, yes, we do have reeducation camps.
[23:06.500 --> 23:09.500]  The details are classified and that's just the end of it.
[23:09.500 --> 23:14.500]  Yeah, there's the headline army manual for reeducation camps applies to US citizens.
[23:14.500 --> 23:16.500]  Isn't that just special?
[23:16.500 --> 23:21.500]  And but it's not just that it's under COG or continuity of government.
[23:21.500 --> 23:27.500]  We've seen first one billion bullets bought this year and then 1.2 and then 1.4.
[23:27.500 --> 23:31.500]  It's now 1.6 billion bullets hollow points bought.
[23:31.500 --> 23:43.500]  But the last 200 million they bought was different types of 308 sniper rounds and they admitted it said in the federal purchase orders that are public at the federal government's website.
[23:43.500 --> 23:48.500]  Let me pull it up for you at the govetrack.us that it's for sniper training.
[23:48.500 --> 23:51.500]  It's only 1.6 billion. That's 13 times.
[23:51.500 --> 23:57.500]  It was 10 times not 13 times because they were another 200 million, but they ever bought before in one year.
[23:57.500 --> 24:05.500]  And we've had police on the show who've told you that, yeah, they're being told it's for martial law.
[24:05.500 --> 24:11.500]  So my big question here is we saw guns confiscated in Katrina.
[24:11.500 --> 24:14.500]  We now have another army training manual just type into the search engine.
[24:14.500 --> 24:16.500]  I know my crews, they're doing it right now.
[24:16.500 --> 24:18.500]  You're watching on prisonplanet.tv.
[24:18.500 --> 24:20.500]  If you're a radio listener, just type this in.
[24:20.500 --> 24:24.500]  Army manual discusses gun confiscation.
[24:24.500 --> 24:25.500]  You saw what they did in Katrina.
[24:25.500 --> 24:27.500]  Went in the high and dry areas.
[24:27.500 --> 24:29.500]  Wouldn't made everybody go to the sports dome.
[24:29.500 --> 24:31.500]  Superdome wouldn't let anybody walk out on the highways.
[24:31.500 --> 24:39.500]  Made you go there and went to the even rich people's houses and blew the doors off their safes and took their guns, took their jewelry.
[24:39.500 --> 24:46.500]  On ABC news is one of the newscasters type in gun confiscation Katrina.
[24:46.500 --> 24:47.500]  There's ABC NBC Fox CNN.
[24:47.500 --> 24:53.500]  Old ladies getting beat up because they won't give their revolver over people with generators living in $15 million houses.
[24:53.500 --> 24:55.500]  Literally, you know, high and dry.
[24:55.500 --> 24:56.500]  Here come the troops.
[24:56.500 --> 24:57.500]  Here comes the big red one.
[24:57.500 --> 24:58.500]  They were there.
[24:58.500 --> 25:00.500]  Here comes army cavalry.
[25:00.500 --> 25:01.500]  Oh, yeah.
[25:01.500 --> 25:05.500]  Right in to take your guns because that's the default setting.
[25:05.500 --> 25:07.500]  They had a cordon cities.
[25:07.500 --> 25:10.500]  There was that army training manual came out a few months ago.
[25:10.500 --> 25:11.500]  Oathkeepers is so mad.
[25:11.500 --> 25:21.500]  They bought billboards outside the base where the army colonel writing the manuals that have now been adopted says we're preparing for war with the tea party.
[25:21.500 --> 25:22.500]  But wait, it got better.
[25:22.500 --> 25:26.500]  They talk about how to cordon the towns, how to arrest the mayors.
[25:26.500 --> 25:34.500]  Well, they know about, you know, the West Texas mayors and judges have gone public saying they know the takeovers happened.
[25:34.500 --> 25:37.500]  So this is the type of stuff going on.
[25:37.500 --> 25:42.500]  I mean, you know, you've heard about the state judges, county judges, people saying here in Texas, you know, we're not going to go along with this takeover.
[25:42.500 --> 25:45.500]  Well, the army is training.
[25:45.500 --> 25:49.500]  But you know why they said it took on the tea party in that army manual?
[25:49.500 --> 25:57.500]  It said because the tea party is going to link up with al-Qaeda, they predict in North Carolina.
[25:57.500 --> 25:58.500]  That's right.
[25:58.500 --> 25:59.500]  The tea party works with al-Qaeda.
[25:59.500 --> 26:02.500]  No, NATO and the globalists run al-Qaeda, not the tea party.
[26:02.500 --> 26:04.500]  You're like, well, that's ridiculous.
[26:04.500 --> 26:12.500]  The tea party is, oh, yeah, if they come arrest you and say you're with al-Qaeda, folks, you're neighbors who might, you know, play poker with you.
[26:12.500 --> 26:18.500]  They're going to salute as you're taken to a FEMA camp and call for your torture because it's patriotic to torture.
[26:18.500 --> 26:20.500]  It's patriotic to have no due process.
[26:20.500 --> 26:25.500]  It's patriotic to have the NDAA where the government says they'll disappear you in the middle of the night.
[26:25.500 --> 26:28.500]  It's patriotic to have the NSA spy on us without warrants.
[26:28.500 --> 26:34.500]  It's patriotic to pay 22 billion to ship GM to China, Cadillac and Volt plants.
[26:34.500 --> 26:37.500]  It's patriotic to hate America and freedom.
[26:37.500 --> 26:38.500]  Okay?
[26:38.500 --> 26:41.500]  That's why I'm a bad person because I love freedom.
[26:41.500 --> 26:42.500]  All right, continuing.
[26:42.500 --> 26:44.500]  Now, here's the new article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[26:44.500 --> 26:47.500]  We've relinked it at the top of infowars.com.
[26:47.500 --> 26:53.500]  FEMA to mobilize for mass fatality planning.
[26:53.500 --> 26:56.500]  FEMA to mobilize for mass fatality planning.
[26:56.500 --> 26:58.500]  Now, you know, Kurt Nemo wrote this.
[26:58.500 --> 27:01.500]  No, no, Paul Watson wrote this Friday.
[27:01.500 --> 27:08.500]  But I should ask him to relink to our article three and a half years ago where we had the emergency manager.
[27:08.500 --> 27:11.500]  I mean, I knew his name, but we didn't give it on air.
[27:11.500 --> 27:18.500]  Well, they had emergency management in a major county bordering Illinois 30-something miles from Chicago.
[27:18.500 --> 27:25.500]  And he said, all I know is they're giving us millions of bucks and saying, get ready for a million dead people from Chicago alone.
[27:25.500 --> 27:31.500]  And they said, it's not a question of if, but when you will have a million dead Chicagoans that we're going to bury here.
[27:31.500 --> 27:33.500]  We're going to truck in and bury here.
[27:33.500 --> 27:38.500]  And they went over Jews and Muslims must be buried within 48 hours.
[27:38.500 --> 27:41.500]  So we've got to check their IDs and all this stuff.
[27:41.500 --> 27:43.500]  People are like, oh, that's not true.
[27:43.500 --> 27:46.500]  Then I had whistleblowers in New York, Texas, Arizona, California.
[27:46.500 --> 27:48.500]  We've seen our articles.
[27:48.500 --> 27:52.500]  Guys, type in cemeteries prepared for mass casualties infowars.com.
[27:52.500 --> 27:58.500]  It'll actually show Aaron Dykes's article from three and a half years ago with the with the scans from New York and Texas.
[27:58.500 --> 28:02.500]  Then we had mortuaries and what do you call them?
[28:02.500 --> 28:05.500]  Cemetery's send us, you know, the funeral directors.
[28:05.500 --> 28:07.500]  Well, we're not supposed to give this out.
[28:07.500 --> 28:12.500]  But yeah, we got the letters and we got visited by FEMA and they said not a question of if, but when this is going to happen.
[28:12.500 --> 28:14.500]  And it's all in there.
[28:14.500 --> 28:16.500]  So we broke this here.
[28:16.500 --> 28:17.500]  Okay.
[28:17.500 --> 28:20.500]  We broke it here on the air infowars.com.
[28:20.500 --> 28:23.500]  Well, here it is. You can go to govetrack.us.
[28:23.500 --> 28:28.500]  This came out Friday and it's past the house.
[28:28.500 --> 28:34.500]  HR 6566 for mass fatality planning and religious considerations act.
[28:34.500 --> 28:37.500]  And it just says they're preparing for millions of dead bodies and I deal with it.
[28:37.500 --> 28:41.500]  And see, there's a major rat ratcheting up for all of this.
[28:41.500 --> 28:46.500]  Yeah, there's our old report plans for mass graves confirmed government serving cemetery readiness for flu outbreak.
[28:46.500 --> 28:49.500]  And that's going to tie into next hour and the flu.
[28:49.500 --> 28:51.500]  You actually get the flu from the flu vaccine.
[28:51.500 --> 28:53.500]  I even have mainstream news on that.
[28:53.500 --> 28:57.500]  But I want to give the number out when we come back and ask you, what are they gearing up for?
[28:57.500 --> 29:23.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[29:23.500 --> 29:49.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[29:49.500 --> 30:18.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[30:18.500 --> 30:44.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[30:44.500 --> 30:59.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[30:59.500 --> 31:25.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[31:25.500 --> 31:51.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[31:51.500 --> 32:20.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[32:20.500 --> 32:47.500]  What are they gearing up for?
[32:47.500 --> 33:01.500]  See them on the web at 5starsope.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[33:01.500 --> 33:25.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:25.500 --> 33:33.500]  All right, I'm giving the number out here in a moment as you know, we don't screen your calls.
[33:33.500 --> 33:41.500]  But occasionally I say, hey, first time callers or I say, hey, we're wanting calls from police officers who would like to talk about the fact that 1.6 billion bullets have been bought.
[33:41.500 --> 33:50.500]  Or I say, hey, they're going to try to make every first responder take forced inoculations under the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[33:50.500 --> 34:00.500]  In 2002, and it was in the news that sheriffs and fire chiefs and you name it were saying no to forced inoculations of 14 million first responders.
[34:00.500 --> 34:09.500]  EMTs, nurses, doctors, police, state police, county city workers, and that program got stopped.
[34:09.500 --> 34:15.500]  They were giving smallpox shots to the first responders.
[34:15.500 --> 34:16.500]  They started the program.
[34:16.500 --> 34:17.500]  Pure color of law.
[34:17.500 --> 34:18.500]  It wasn't even law.
[34:18.500 --> 34:20.500]  They said, you got to have this to have this job.
[34:20.500 --> 34:22.500]  And so many people died from it.
[34:22.500 --> 34:27.500]  If you go back to the news 10 years ago in 2002, they suspended it.
[34:27.500 --> 34:41.500]  They suspended the program because the LA Times reported they only shot up 6% of the 14 million first responders and hundreds and hundreds died from it.
[34:41.500 --> 34:43.500]  And they had big trouble keeping it quiet.
[34:43.500 --> 34:54.500]  Just like three separate times the last 20 years, they've had more than 20 years, 21 years since 1990, they have done forced inoculations of troops with anthrax shot.
[34:54.500 --> 35:00.500]  You can make troops because they've waived their rights, take an approved vaccine, but not experimental.
[35:00.500 --> 35:02.500]  Why am I digressing off into this?
[35:02.500 --> 35:11.500]  Under this medical tyranny that I'm going to cover next hour that ties into this martial law preparation, they are going to force all the first responders to take shots.
[35:11.500 --> 35:15.500]  And they're starting with nurses saying, you can't work here if you don't.
[35:15.500 --> 35:17.500]  There's no law.
[35:17.500 --> 35:19.500]  They just say, you can't work here.
[35:19.500 --> 35:23.500]  Well, now Rhode Island has passed a law for forced inoculation of nurses.
[35:23.500 --> 35:25.500]  And folks, it's going to be police next.
[35:25.500 --> 35:29.500]  And so you need to understand a lot of you are going to go along.
[35:29.500 --> 35:31.500]  You need to understand why you die, why you get sick.
[35:31.500 --> 35:37.500]  A lot of wives out there and wonder why your husband has a convulsion, you know, coming home from work one day.
[35:37.500 --> 35:42.500]  Well, nobody's going to tell him back at the police station. It's because he went and got the flu shot.
[35:42.500 --> 35:46.500]  I mean, it's on the stinking insert, but it doesn't matter.
[35:46.500 --> 35:49.500]  So we're going to be going over all that in the next hour.
[35:49.500 --> 35:50.500]  Big report on that.
[35:50.500 --> 35:56.500]  Before I get back into this whole martial law situation and give out the number, we're selling out of this again very quickly.
[35:56.500 --> 35:58.500]  I printed 100,000 of these.
[35:58.500 --> 36:01.500]  We put 50,000 of them on the streets of Austin.
[36:01.500 --> 36:09.500]  We've already got people lined up around the block. Great folks as we codify the program to roll out the new info wars magazine in cities all over the country.
[36:09.500 --> 36:11.500]  We're part of the news will be local.
[36:11.500 --> 36:14.500]  But this is kind of the mother ship global edition.
[36:14.500 --> 36:18.500]  And we've now put out two issues of it.
[36:18.500 --> 36:27.500]  The first time I put it out, we put 50,000 on the streets, printed another 40,000, 37,000, 36,000 sold out in a day and a half.
[36:27.500 --> 36:32.500]  This time I printed more than 50,000 extras on top of the 50,000 on the streets.
[36:32.500 --> 36:37.500]  And we've still got some left about, I don't know, 12,000 or so, but they're going quickly.
[36:37.500 --> 36:46.500]  So if you want to buy it in bulk, the new info wars magazine, the new October issue DARPA, the real Skynet October surprise war question mark.
[36:46.500 --> 36:51.500]  The end of humanity rise of the robots, the elites own words, how they plan to replace us with machines.
[36:51.500 --> 36:53.500]  This is an emergency transmission.
[36:53.500 --> 37:00.500]  And then the first issue from September, people that subscribe get this issue as well.
[37:00.500 --> 37:06.500]  And the next 12 and shipping is included free of charge at infowarstore.com.
[37:06.500 --> 37:12.500]  Info wars magazine, the economic collapse bankers plot to destroy the US economy in their own words.
[37:12.500 --> 37:14.500]  Banking cartel conquers America.
[37:14.500 --> 37:16.500]  History of false flag stage terror.
[37:16.500 --> 37:21.500]  Rome burned will we since then they've got fires and riding all over Europe.
[37:21.500 --> 37:23.500]  And we predicted that would happen.
[37:23.500 --> 37:25.500]  Print 2.0, the answer the internet kill switch.
[37:25.500 --> 37:27.500]  These are great.
[37:27.500 --> 37:32.500]  I mean, thick magazines with great graphics to give friends and family to wake them up.
[37:32.500 --> 37:38.500]  I can't say it really supports the broadcast because the subscriptions and buying individual issues at bulk.
[37:38.500 --> 37:45.500]  We're selling them at cost as a as a pamphleteer like the founding fathers did.
[37:45.500 --> 37:56.500]  Or my ancestors that came to Texas, well, my dad's side in 1830, the others in 1825 or so as the Texians shouldn't get off.
[37:56.500 --> 37:58.500]  I visited the Alamo again this weekend with my kids.
[37:58.500 --> 38:04.500]  And it's just really interesting that my family were the folks that brought in the Bibles and all the rest of it really got the rebellion going.
[38:04.500 --> 38:06.500]  But that's a separate, separate whole story.
[38:06.500 --> 38:13.500]  Protestant Bibles weren't allowed in Texas, but that's a side issue.
[38:13.500 --> 38:17.500]  We are living under an incredible tyranny.
[38:17.500 --> 38:24.500]  And if you want to get the magazines and get them out to people, they're available at costs at infowarstore.com.
[38:24.500 --> 38:26.500]  All with the books, the videos, the t-shirts, all the rest of it.
[38:26.500 --> 38:27.500]  They're not at cost.
[38:27.500 --> 38:30.500]  Obviously, that's how we finance ourselves is through the free market.
[38:30.500 --> 38:31.500]  We're not like mainstream media.
[38:31.500 --> 38:36.500]  Most of them they get banker bailout money or stimulus money to give Rachel Maddow raises.
[38:36.500 --> 38:37.500]  Did you read about that?
[38:37.500 --> 38:44.500]  What is it, 500,000 of hundreds of millions that MSNBC got of taxpayer money and stimulus went to her?
[38:44.500 --> 38:48.500]  People are like, Alex, you should have the sell products you believe in to fund your operation.
[38:48.500 --> 38:52.500]  The biggest alternative media organization and most successful in the world now.
[38:52.500 --> 38:56.500]  You should just be more moral and steal taxpayer money.
[38:56.500 --> 38:57.500]  Well, I'm sorry.
[38:57.500 --> 38:58.500]  I don't do that.
[38:58.500 --> 38:59.500]  Okay.
[38:59.500 --> 39:00.500]  I'm ranting.
[39:00.500 --> 39:01.500]  I'm done ranting about that.
[39:01.500 --> 39:07.500]  Yeah, there it is, Labor Department spent 500G and stimulus on green job ad blitz on Oberman and Maddow.
[39:07.500 --> 39:09.500]  Yeah, that's separate from that.
[39:09.500 --> 39:16.500]  There was even another whole other program there and they got half a billion bucks in MSNBC and banker bailout money.
[39:16.500 --> 39:18.500]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[39:18.500 --> 39:29.500]  If you just tuned in, Army Manuals Republic for reeducation camps, master rest, gun confiscation, forced inoculation, type in clergy response teams.
[39:29.500 --> 39:41.500]  Every major church in the country that I know of, unless it's a private evangelical or private individual church has been federalized under 501C3.
[39:41.500 --> 39:52.500]  And if you type in clergy response team, you'll see newscast with preachers saying we've been trained under martial law to tell you to turn your guns in and take shots and go to FEMA camps.
[39:52.500 --> 39:53.500]  I can play newscast.
[39:53.500 --> 39:57.500]  There's multiple newscast with them admitting it and saying it's a good thing.
[39:57.500 --> 40:07.500]  So if you're a new listener and you wonder why your preacher, every Sunday is telling you to give in to government, do what you're told, turn your guns in, doesn't matter if it's Catholic, Baptist.
[40:07.500 --> 40:17.500]  You know, the churches where my parents have gone, they basically teach that, you know, world government's a wonderful thing and Bill and Melinda Gates hung the moon.
[40:17.500 --> 40:19.500]  It's just amazing.
[40:19.500 --> 40:21.500]  I was talking to some friends this weekend.
[40:21.500 --> 40:28.500]  They were talking about the Presbyterian church where they'd gone forever, which is super conservative, hung a red cloth.
[40:28.500 --> 40:32.500]  And this is happening nationwide at Presbyterian churches, not all of them, but most of them.
[40:32.500 --> 40:38.500]  The cross is now bad and hateful so they can't show the cross in Presbyterian churches.
[40:38.500 --> 40:39.500]  I mean, we got taken over.
[40:39.500 --> 40:43.500]  World Council of Churches run by the UN Rockefeller Foundation.
[40:43.500 --> 40:45.500]  They've got consultants at all the churches now.
[40:45.500 --> 40:54.500]  The federal government says if you want faith-based money, taxpayer money, even though Congress can make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,
[40:54.500 --> 40:56.500]  government cannot be involved.
[40:56.500 --> 40:58.500]  That's the separation of church and state.
[40:58.500 --> 41:04.500]  Now government flips it around and says no, government has to run religion and religion doesn't have any independence.
[41:04.500 --> 41:06.500]  That's what Thomas Jefferson said.
[41:06.500 --> 41:08.500]  No, Thomas Jefferson said the opposite.
[41:08.500 --> 41:11.500]  So you can't have state-run religion.
[41:11.500 --> 41:19.500]  But then they twist that and then Christians don't like Thomas Jefferson because they've let the media lie to them about what separation of church and state is.
[41:19.500 --> 41:27.500]  Separation of church and state doesn't mean that first Baptist are the only religion here or Muslims that happen to be Wahhabist or Catholics.
[41:27.500 --> 41:29.500]  It means freedom of religion.
[41:29.500 --> 41:33.500]  That was one of the big things 1776 was about.
[41:33.500 --> 41:39.500]  That's what the Texas Revolution was really about was the fact you couldn't practice anything but Catholicism in Texas.
[41:39.500 --> 41:40.500]  But that's another issue.
[41:40.500 --> 41:43.500]  It's the same fight over and over again.
[41:43.500 --> 41:49.500]  And I was talking, in fact, I'm going to send crews out to these Presbyterian churches.
[41:49.500 --> 41:54.500]  So send us links at whistleblowers.infowars.com or showtipsinfowars.com.
[41:54.500 --> 42:00.500]  Because we've confirmed there's churches right in Central Texas which have now taken the crosses down.
[42:00.500 --> 42:04.500]  Because they're hateful.
[42:04.500 --> 42:09.500]  Oh, in Europe they're banning reading passages out of the Bible they say are hateful.
[42:09.500 --> 42:13.500]  Canada has arrested preachers for saying homosexuality is wrong.
[42:13.500 --> 42:16.500]  Whether you agree with that or not, it's free speech.
[42:16.500 --> 42:18.500]  This is such authoritarianism.
[42:18.500 --> 42:23.500]  Every basic liberty is being overrun right now.
[42:23.500 --> 42:27.500]  Every basic freedom is being abridged right now.
[42:27.500 --> 42:32.500]  At every single level it's happening right now.
[42:32.500 --> 42:35.500]  So I ask you the listeners, why are they gearing up?
[42:35.500 --> 42:38.500]  What is the giant preparation for?
[42:38.500 --> 42:40.500]  Why are they gearing up?
[42:40.500 --> 42:42.500]  The economic collapse giant war with Iran?
[42:42.500 --> 42:44.500]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[42:44.500 --> 42:46.500]  877-789-ALEX.
[42:46.500 --> 42:49.500]  877-789-ALEX.
[42:49.500 --> 42:52.500]  877-789-2539.
[42:52.500 --> 42:54.500]  It's Sunday. We're live.
[42:54.500 --> 42:57.500]  We're going to come back and talk about the preparations for total collapse.
[42:57.500 --> 42:59.500]  Stay with us.
[42:59.500 --> 43:01.500]  Aaron Fullen here.
[43:01.500 --> 43:04.500]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers,
[43:04.500 --> 43:06.500]  Americans are losing access.
[43:06.500 --> 43:08.500]  Not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses,
[43:08.500 --> 43:12.500]  but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[43:12.500 --> 43:16.500]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[43:16.500 --> 43:19.500]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[43:19.500 --> 43:22.500]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history,
[43:22.500 --> 43:27.500]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[43:27.500 --> 43:32.500]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi,
[43:32.500 --> 43:35.500]  and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[43:35.500 --> 43:36.500]  But here's some good news.
[43:36.500 --> 43:42.500]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes,
[43:42.500 --> 43:45.500]  since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[43:45.500 --> 43:48.500]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[43:48.500 --> 43:50.500]  That's fermentationfactor.com.

[43:53.500 --> 43:56.500]  and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[43:56.500 --> 44:00.500]  That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[44:00.500 --> 44:05.500]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional-class product
[44:05.500 --> 44:11.500]  for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[44:41.500 --> 44:46.500]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver,

[44:59.500 --> 45:05.500]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest half-year on record.
[45:05.500 --> 45:08.500]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[45:08.500 --> 45:14.500]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[45:14.500 --> 45:19.500]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[45:19.500 --> 45:23.500]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices
[45:23.500 --> 45:26.500]  by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[45:26.500 --> 45:30.500]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[45:30.500 --> 45:32.500]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[45:32.500 --> 45:36.500]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[45:36.500 --> 45:39.500]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[45:39.500 --> 45:43.500]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today, and because it stores for 25 years,
[45:43.500 --> 45:46.500]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[45:46.500 --> 45:52.500]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[45:52.500 --> 45:57.500]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[45:57.500 --> 45:59.500]  You can bet your life on eFoods direct.
[45:59.500 --> 46:03.500]  Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freak setting poison to your water?
[46:03.500 --> 46:05.500]  And laughing as you get sick and die?
[46:05.500 --> 46:07.500]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[46:07.500 --> 46:13.500]  My friends, I've done a lot of research, and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun, is ProPure.
[46:13.500 --> 46:16.500]  And it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[46:16.500 --> 46:20.500]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth.
[46:20.500 --> 46:24.500]  There's no priming required. It's NSF-42 certified.
[46:24.500 --> 46:27.500]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[46:27.500 --> 46:30.500]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity.
[46:30.500 --> 46:33.500]  Purify water from lake streams, ponds, and wells.
[46:33.500 --> 46:37.500]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[46:37.500 --> 46:41.500]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[46:41.500 --> 46:44.500]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[47:25.500 --> 47:28.500]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[47:31.500 --> 47:35.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:39.500 --> 47:44.500]  Again, I just want to thank all the listeners, sponsors, AM&FM affiliates that make this broadcast possible,
[47:44.500 --> 47:50.500]  and our incredible crew, my wife and family, and of course the good Lord above.
[47:50.500 --> 47:54.500]  I was also talking to people about all the churches they're going to, friends and family.
[47:54.500 --> 47:58.500]  And they were talking about how, yeah, all these big mainline churches now say,
[47:58.500 --> 48:03.500]  we don't say the word Jesus, because that could be offensive at Christian churches.
[48:03.500 --> 48:07.500]  Or if we do, it's not Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ.
[48:07.500 --> 48:11.500]  It's just Jesus, our avatar, our spirit guide.
[48:11.500 --> 48:13.500]  I mean, no wonder the churches are collapsing.
[48:13.500 --> 48:16.500]  They've taken God completely out of it. I don't mean to start preaching here.
[48:16.500 --> 48:21.500]  It's just that this is a government takeover. This isn't happening on its own.
[48:21.500 --> 48:26.500]  We've got a lot of people on hold, Pete, Gary, Dan, Abe, and I don't know,
[48:26.500 --> 48:29.500]  10 or so others that we're getting your names on.
[48:29.500 --> 48:34.500]  I'm going to go to you right now, but you see all these TV shows about the end of the world
[48:34.500 --> 48:39.500]  and revolution and collapse and all this show that when things start collapsing,
[48:39.500 --> 48:44.500]  we're almost ready for it, that we just expect it's normal.
[48:44.500 --> 48:47.500]  But it's being engineered as the globalists have stated.
[48:47.500 --> 48:51.500]  Morey Strong and others, they want a post-industrial world.
[48:51.500 --> 48:54.500]  They want to use poverty to control us.
[48:54.500 --> 48:59.500]  This is all being artificially done, and it doesn't have to happen.
[48:59.500 --> 49:04.500]  And I see the signs of the deep recession we've been in for five years.
[49:04.500 --> 49:06.500]  They say the recession ended four years ago.
[49:06.500 --> 49:10.500]  They put out countless fake economic employment numbers that have improved in fake.
[49:10.500 --> 49:12.500]  John Williams' shadow stats breaks that down.
[49:12.500 --> 49:17.500]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former head of Reagan's operations,
[49:17.500 --> 49:20.500]  head of policy at the Treasury, it's totally fake.
[49:20.500 --> 49:22.500]  It's above 22%.
[49:22.500 --> 49:25.500]  California is above 30%, even 60 minutes to the study on that last year.
[49:25.500 --> 49:27.500]  It's above that now.
[49:27.500 --> 49:31.500]  Areas of Europe, some areas of Spain have 50%.
[49:31.500 --> 49:36.500]  This is a global depression by design that the bankers brag,
[49:36.500 --> 49:41.500]  not the free market bankers, not your corner bank that's being shut down by globalist regulators,
[49:41.500 --> 49:44.500]  but the megabanks.
[49:44.500 --> 49:49.500]  And so FEMA's preparing for millions of debt and getting that lined up with the mortuaries
[49:49.500 --> 49:52.500]  and mass graves and the equipment and the plastic coffins.
[49:52.500 --> 49:54.500]  That's all confirmed now.
[49:54.500 --> 49:56.500]  And they're gearing up.
[49:56.500 --> 49:59.500]  It's not like it's some old program they're continuing.
[49:59.500 --> 50:01.500]  And you've got all these preparations.
[50:01.500 --> 50:02.500]  What do you think this is about?
[50:02.500 --> 50:05.500]  I'll take your calls for about 30 minutes to the next hour.
[50:05.500 --> 50:10.500]  Then I'm going to get into forced inoculations and all of that news.
[50:10.500 --> 50:15.500]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Pete and Rhode Island where they've passed a law
[50:15.500 --> 50:19.500]  showing all the nurses have to take whatever vaccine the government says,
[50:19.500 --> 50:23.500]  basically the flu shots, which I have mainstream articles in Government of Canada
[50:23.500 --> 50:28.500]  says the flu shot doubles your chances of the average flu shot of getting flu the next year.
[50:28.500 --> 50:30.500]  But of course, it gives people the flu in many cases.
[50:30.500 --> 50:32.500]  I have all the mainstream articles I'm going to cover next hour.
[50:32.500 --> 50:36.500]  But is that what you called in about from Rhode Island or something else?
[50:36.500 --> 50:40.500]  Hey, Alex, no, my name's Pete. I'm from Long Island, Long Island, New York.
[50:40.500 --> 50:43.500]  I'm sorry, it said R.I. there, Pete.
[50:43.500 --> 50:45.500]  Okay, so you're from Long Island, not Rhode Island.
[50:45.500 --> 50:47.500]  But it's still in Island. Go ahead.
[50:47.500 --> 50:50.500]  Yeah, I mean, we are in the general area.
[50:50.500 --> 50:52.500]  I'm actually a first responder.
[50:52.500 --> 50:56.500]  I'm an EMT for a major hospital out here in Long Island.
[50:56.500 --> 50:58.500]  I'm a Navy veteran.
[50:58.500 --> 51:00.500]  I was a private investigator for 14 years.
[51:00.500 --> 51:04.500]  I actually met you down at Bilderberg this past June with a couple of buddies of mine.
[51:04.500 --> 51:08.500]  We run a website called Concerned Citizens News Network.
[51:08.500 --> 51:10.500]  Oh, that's right. It was great talking to you guys.
[51:10.500 --> 51:12.500]  Yeah, you guys are doing a great job.
[51:12.500 --> 51:14.500]  Yeah, thanks a lot. And so are you, Alex.
[51:14.500 --> 51:18.500]  Thanks so much for waking everyone up, you know, with people who are concerned.
[51:18.500 --> 51:22.500]  And I just wanted to say that there are some stories out there
[51:22.500 --> 51:25.500]  that they're going to make first responders like myself, EMTs,
[51:25.500 --> 51:31.500]  either get the flu shot or have to wear a surgical mask as we're treating patients.
[51:31.500 --> 51:33.500]  Yeah, let me stop you. It's not a story.
[51:33.500 --> 51:35.500]  Just like Gulf of Tonkin was never a rumor.
[51:35.500 --> 51:37.500]  It came out in Congress that it was staged.
[51:37.500 --> 51:41.500]  There was an investigation and it was in the local San Diego paper
[51:41.500 --> 51:43.500]  when the ships came back in 64.
[51:43.500 --> 51:45.500]  But no one ever had those documents.
[51:45.500 --> 51:48.500]  It became word of mouth and a rumor.
[51:48.500 --> 51:51.500]  It's the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[51:51.500 --> 51:54.500]  They tried to make you all take shots in 02.
[51:54.500 --> 51:59.500]  Then they said they would phase it in by first making first responders wear a mask,
[51:59.500 --> 52:02.500]  then intimidating you into taking it, then passing laws.
[52:02.500 --> 52:06.500]  It's not a rumor. They've now passed it in Rhode Island.
[52:06.500 --> 52:07.500]  Go ahead.
[52:07.500 --> 52:10.500]  It's not just a story. I actually misspoke.
[52:10.500 --> 52:12.500]  It was actually something I read in an article
[52:12.500 --> 52:15.500]  and it's been being passed around throughout the healthcare system
[52:15.500 --> 52:18.500]  that we're either going to have to take the flu shot or wear a surgical mask
[52:18.500 --> 52:20.500]  because, you know, we're treating patients.
[52:20.500 --> 52:23.500]  And it's pure bull. I mean, the idea is you are dirty.
[52:23.500 --> 52:25.500]  You are bad. You have the flu.
[52:25.500 --> 52:28.500]  When the flu vaccine never covers the current flu
[52:28.500 --> 52:32.500]  and it lowers your immunity in major studies, I'm going to read next hour.
[52:32.500 --> 52:34.500]  It's a total hoax, sir.
[52:34.500 --> 52:37.500]  Yes, it is. I firmly believe what you're saying.
[52:37.500 --> 52:41.500]  I firmly believe the stories that are being passed out there through the media.
[52:41.500 --> 52:46.500]  So tell me, what's your take on your fellow first responders' take on this?
[52:46.500 --> 52:48.500]  We're totally against it.
[52:48.500 --> 52:52.500]  I would say in general, it's about a 70-30 split that we're totally against it.
[52:52.500 --> 52:56.500]  It actually goes against the Constitution.
[52:56.500 --> 53:02.500]  They can't force us to do something that it's just against, it's anti-human.
[53:02.500 --> 53:05.500]  You're right. In fact, let me read this to you.
[53:05.500 --> 53:07.500]  This is out of the Providence Journal.
[53:07.500 --> 53:11.500]  Rhode Island becomes first state to mandate flu shots for healthcare workers,
[53:11.500 --> 53:14.500]  breaking news. This just came out Friday evening.
[53:14.500 --> 53:17.500]  And understand something.
[53:17.500 --> 53:20.500]  They cannot make you put things in your body.
[53:20.500 --> 53:24.500]  A, B, they admit that the Civil Liberties Union,
[53:24.500 --> 53:29.500]  the healthcare workers' unions, all of them are against it.
[53:29.500 --> 53:33.500]  And they admit that almost all of the union members are against it.
[53:33.500 --> 53:36.500]  But they don't care. But I read this more closely.
[53:36.500 --> 53:39.500]  It's a mandate. It's not a law.
[53:39.500 --> 53:42.500]  Remember Rick Perry five, six years ago, he said,
[53:42.500 --> 53:46.500]  it's the law. All girls, 11 to 13, must take Gardasil.
[53:46.500 --> 53:48.500]  An experimental vaccine, they couldn't even get approved.
[53:48.500 --> 53:50.500]  But government can quote mandate it.
[53:50.500 --> 53:53.500]  Mandate just means they're saying they want you to take it.
[53:53.500 --> 53:56.500]  And then a bunch of girls died. Well, they died in the test.
[53:56.500 --> 53:58.500]  But by him saying it's mandated,
[53:58.500 --> 54:02.500]  it now got liability protection and access to a $7 billion federal fund.
[54:02.500 --> 54:07.500]  So Merck could dump, who's well known for that, a deadly drug on the market.
[54:07.500 --> 54:09.500]  But, but Perry got destroyed.
[54:09.500 --> 54:12.500]  In fact, a many analysts, even the Washington Post,
[54:12.500 --> 54:17.500]  chalk up his defeat in polls to folks learning about the Gardasil.
[54:17.500 --> 54:22.500]  So this is a, you know, the big pharma can buy people off all day long.
[54:22.500 --> 54:26.500]  Yeah, there it is. Rick Perry's HPV mandate returns to haunt him.
[54:26.500 --> 54:30.500]  Politico. It's also the Associated Press, you name it.
[54:30.500 --> 54:33.500]  So I'm ranting, sir, but it's a hoax.
[54:33.500 --> 54:37.500]  I've now had time to go look at the quote law they passed.
[54:37.500 --> 54:41.500]  And all it is is a mandate where they say it's the law.
[54:41.500 --> 54:44.500]  Have you heard before school every year, they say it's the law to take shots in the school.
[54:44.500 --> 54:47.500]  There is no law. Again, even if you're for the vaccines folks,
[54:47.500 --> 54:50.500]  why are they lying and saying it's the law?
[54:50.500 --> 54:54.500]  I appreciate the policy. Exactly.
[54:54.500 --> 54:57.500]  It's all just a bunch of policy. I appreciate your call.
[54:57.500 --> 55:00.500]  I've had police all over the country. God bless them.
[55:00.500 --> 55:02.500]  You know, they're humans too. They're dumbed down like everybody else.
[55:02.500 --> 55:04.500]  I wanted to live in a free country. I'm not their enemy.
[55:04.500 --> 55:06.500]  Come up and say, you can't videotape.
[55:06.500 --> 55:08.500]  And I'm like, I'm a hundred yards from you.
[55:08.500 --> 55:10.500]  I'm not interfering with you.
[55:10.500 --> 55:13.500]  I just, and they say, well, I'm still going to arrest you.
[55:13.500 --> 55:16.500]  And I have to say to the cops, I go, what's the law?
[55:16.500 --> 55:19.500]  They go, it's our policy. You know, you know, a policy is not a law.
[55:19.500 --> 55:24.500]  Stop it. Well, I'm giving you an order, but is that order lawful officer?
[55:24.500 --> 55:27.500]  They arrest most people when they refuse. They don't know how to talk to them.
[55:27.500 --> 55:30.500]  The cops always back off because they go, listen, I'm going to sue you.
[55:30.500 --> 55:33.500]  You may even beat it, but I don't want to be your enemy,
[55:33.500 --> 55:35.500]  but you cannot violate the sacred first amendment.
[55:35.500 --> 55:38.500]  And the cops are like, every time I've got it on video,
[55:38.500 --> 55:42.500]  you know, get mad and run off. One time the Austin commander had,
[55:42.500 --> 55:46.500]  I was protesting Rick Perry at an event down at the Omni Hotel.
[55:46.500 --> 55:50.500]  And Perry sent the cop, they had the cops getting in their riot gear
[55:50.500 --> 55:52.500]  across the street to intimidate us.
[55:52.500 --> 55:56.500]  And the cop in front of the newspaper and TV station was like,
[55:56.500 --> 55:59.500]  I didn't say I'd arrest you, even though we had it on tape,
[55:59.500 --> 56:01.500]  but he was saying, we're going to arrest you.
[56:01.500 --> 56:03.500]  And you see those riot police with their batons.
[56:03.500 --> 56:06.500]  Imagine being a cop and saying, you see those riot police,
[56:06.500 --> 56:08.500]  you see the batons, like that's going to scare me.
[56:08.500 --> 56:11.500]  And it was the fact that he challenged me that I had to say,
[56:11.500 --> 56:13.500]  okay, go ahead and do whatever you got to do.
[56:13.500 --> 56:15.500]  I'm going to keep protesting. I'm not blocking the street.
[56:15.500 --> 56:18.500]  See, they lied to you and see you have to get a permit to protest,
[56:18.500 --> 56:21.500]  only if you want to shut down streets.
[56:21.500 --> 56:24.500]  See, they get you into procedures.
[56:24.500 --> 56:27.500]  It's just like churches until about 1950.
[56:27.500 --> 56:30.500]  No churches were 501C3 charities.
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.500]  No longer churches, they become charities.
[56:32.500 --> 56:34.500]  It's a bait and switch.
[56:34.500 --> 56:36.500]  I'm ranting here.
[56:36.500 --> 56:38.500]  We're going to go to break and I promise just come back
[56:38.500 --> 56:40.500]  and go to your phone calls.
[56:40.500 --> 56:42.500]  But see, once they tricked the churches over,
[56:42.500 --> 56:45.500]  then churches don't even remember once
[56:45.500 --> 56:47.500]  that they were stand alone outside of government.
[56:47.500 --> 56:49.500]  But then they opt in.
[56:49.500 --> 56:52.500]  Congress can't make a law respecting the establishment of religion
[56:52.500 --> 56:54.500]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[56:54.500 --> 56:57.500]  They have no jurisdiction, federal or state.
[56:57.500 --> 57:00.500]  But by getting the churches to sign on,
[57:00.500 --> 57:02.500]  they go, oh, you have your tax exemption.
[57:02.500 --> 57:04.500]  Just fill out this form for your charity status.
[57:04.500 --> 57:07.500]  They trick you via contract fraud
[57:07.500 --> 57:09.500]  to step into that and wave all rights.
[57:09.500 --> 57:11.500]  Same thing with vaccines.
[57:11.500 --> 57:14.500]  And again, I'm not saying the science of vaccination
[57:14.500 --> 57:16.500]  couldn't have some benefits.
[57:16.500 --> 57:18.500]  It's a 500-year-old technology.
[57:18.500 --> 57:20.500]  It's got its problems.
[57:20.500 --> 57:23.500]  The issue is eugenicist population control groups
[57:23.500 --> 57:26.500]  founded all the big major pharma companies
[57:26.500 --> 57:28.500]  in the last 150 years, look it up.
[57:28.500 --> 57:30.500]  And the Rockefellers funded Hitler.
[57:30.500 --> 57:33.500]  Everything Hitler did is what you call eugenics.
[57:33.500 --> 57:36.500]  And the eugenicists went underground through big pharma
[57:36.500 --> 57:38.500]  and the medical tyranny.
[57:38.500 --> 57:40.500]  They used medical tyranny in the Soviet Union,
[57:40.500 --> 57:42.500]  they used medical tyranny on the political dissidents.
[57:42.500 --> 57:45.500]  That's what we're facing today is a medical tyranny.
[57:45.500 --> 58:14.500]  We'll be right back.
[58:15.500 --> 58:17.500]  We'll be right back.
[58:45.500 --> 58:48.500]  That's www.supernaturalsilver.com
[58:48.500 --> 59:17.500]  and like us on Facebook.
[59:18.500 --> 59:46.500]  We'll be right back.
[59:49.500 --> 59:54.500]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:54.500 --> 59:58.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[59:58.500 --> 1:00:01.500]  Network.
[1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:05.500]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[1:00:05.500 --> 1:00:08.500]  the information war continues.
[1:00:08.500 --> 1:00:13.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:15.500]  Well, the feds are announcing they're going to get
[1:00:15.500 --> 1:00:19.500]  these bioscanners on the highways that claim you've got drugs on you
[1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:20.500]  has probably caused a rash.
[1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:22.500]  The TSA is going to get them.
[1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:25.500]  What a hellish world we're building for the predators to be able to feed on us
[1:00:25.500 --> 1:00:28.500]  while their boss is shipping the narcotics.
[1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:30.500]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:33.500]  Let's talk to Scott in Colorado.
[1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:35.500]  And then we'll go to Gary and others.
[1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:42.500]  Go ahead, Scott, you're on the air.
[1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:45.500]  Hey, Scott, yes, sir, I do hear you.
[1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:47.500]  All right.
[1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:48.500]  Okay.
[1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:49.500]  There's a lot going on.
[1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:50.500]  Yeah, there is.
[1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:51.500]  You're on air.
[1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:52.500]  Go ahead.
[1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:57.500]  So yeah, with these mandatory vaccinations that they're making our service workers take,
[1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:01.500]  it shouldn't be a surprise because they are dumbing down the Stasi force
[1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:03.500]  that Obama's putting in place.
[1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:06.500]  I did go out there and I protested Mitt Romney and Barack Obama
[1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:08.500]  when they came here on the debate.
[1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:11.500]  And like you said, is voting even going to matter?
[1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:14.500]  I was thinking about voting for Gary Johnson.
[1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:19.500]  But more and more, I'm leaning away from not even participating in the corrupt system.
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:24.500]  Because like Gerald Solende says, our Mexicans are every which one,
[1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:28.500]  if we don't participate and there are over 60% of us don't participate,
[1:01:28.500 --> 1:01:33.500]  then we can prove that the Republican, Democrat, corporate parties are the problem
[1:01:33.500 --> 1:01:35.500]  and we can actually change the system then.
[1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:41.500]  I see so many die hard Obaminess and Republicans that look at Mitt Romney
[1:01:41.500 --> 1:01:43.500]  like he's the second coming of Ronald Reagan.
[1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:45.500]  Oh, Obamnius.
[1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:46.500]  I like that.
[1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:48.500]  Obamnius.
[1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:50.500]  Obamnius.
[1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:51.500]  Obamnius.
[1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.500]  Obamni Romnius.
[1:01:53.500 --> 1:01:55.500]  That Freudian flip.
[1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:56.500]  They're both the same.
[1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:57.500]  There's no difference.
[1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:59.500]  Obamnius.
[1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:02.500]  I look at Mitt Romney like he's a Frankenstein douchebag
[1:02:02.500 --> 1:02:08.500]  and then you look at Obama with this condescending, you know, socialistic behavior.
[1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:11.500]  Well, there's no doubt that Obama is worse.
[1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:14.500]  But it doesn't matter because they're still on the same team.
[1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:15.500]  It's incredible.
[1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:17.500]  I appreciate your call.
[1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:20.500]  Let's go to Gary in New Orleans.
[1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:21.500]  Gary, you're on the air.
[1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:22.500]  Go ahead.
[1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:25.500]  Hey, Alex, I know you remember me.
[1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:30.500]  I remember going to your studio in the final days when you're about to move to the other one
[1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:32.500]  to get advice on my own radio show.
[1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:36.500]  Yeah, I remember you and your wife or girlfriend came to visit.
[1:02:36.500 --> 1:02:37.500]  Yeah, what's going on?
[1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:39.500]  I think I've been on your radio show before.
[1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:42.500]  We've been hosting Patriot Radio for five years.
[1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:44.500]  We follow everything.
[1:02:44.500 --> 1:02:48.500]  We listen to you every day and we pretty much promote everything you're talking about.
[1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:52.500]  And you did thank me for taking action back then, but I'm taking more action now.
[1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:57.500]  I'm actually running for Congress of the United States against Steve Scalise
[1:02:57.500 --> 1:03:02.500]  who's voted for the Patriot Act twice, the National Defense Authorization Act,
[1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:05.500]  the Disclosure Act, and the number one maker.
[1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:09.500]  I mean, his number one campaign contributor is now Code,
[1:03:09.500 --> 1:03:12.500]  the makers of the deadly dispersant, corrects it.
[1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:17.500]  And they were the number one supporter or lobbyist for the Restore Act,
[1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:21.500]  which has nothing to do with restoring our coastline.
[1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:26.500]  What they're going to do is take the BP fine money and give it to the federal government.
[1:03:26.500 --> 1:03:33.500]  And it's the usual suspects, the EPA, the ecosystems, fisheries,
[1:03:33.500 --> 1:03:35.500]  just all that kind of stuff.
[1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:37.500]  So I'm calling to ask for your help.
[1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:43.500]  If you want someone who's completely awake, I would like to at least announce my website
[1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:46.500]  and even more, I would like for you to help me out
[1:03:46.500 --> 1:03:51.500]  because I understand everything that you're talking about and the current congressman.
[1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:56.500]  Well, brother, I have certainly tried to help everybody
[1:03:56.500 --> 1:03:58.500]  and I tried to help you out with advice.
[1:03:58.500 --> 1:04:01.500]  I think I met with you for about 30 minutes even though I don't have the time.
[1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:05.500]  But I'm just a regular guy on my shelf, a pretty darn burnout some days.
[1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:07.500]  But, I mean, here you are.
[1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:13.500]  I think everybody listening to us in Louisiana or that area should go get behind you.
[1:04:13.500 --> 1:04:17.500]  I think I've been on your show as a guest and now I've heard a CD of it.
[1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:18.500]  Somebody sent me once at least.
[1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:20.500]  I've been on your show, right?
[1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.500]  Yeah, a couple of times now.
[1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:23.500]  Sure, sure.
[1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:24.500]  So here's the deal.
[1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:27.500]  Give out your website if people don't want to support you.
[1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:28.500]  All right.
[1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:37.500]  My website is type it in the browser www.yourvoiceincongress.org.
[1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:38.500]  Sure.
[1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:40.500]  Your voice in congress.org or just your name.
[1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:42.500]  What your name's Gary King, right?
[1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:43.500]  Gary King.
[1:04:43.500 --> 1:04:45.500]  And if you remember, we met in Dealey Plaza.
[1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:46.500]  We were at the end of Fed Rally.
[1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:48.500]  I'm actually in the Obama discussion.
[1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:49.500]  Sure, brother.
[1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:50.500]  Great job.
[1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:51.500]  Keep it up.
[1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:53.500]  And if everybody did what you were doing, we'd win because just being in the debates,
[1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:56.500]  just going to town halls, you're going to inject real issues.
[1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:57.500]  Beautiful.
[1:04:57.500 --> 1:04:58.500]  Great job.
[1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:23.500]  Thank you.
[1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:49.500]  Thank you.
[1:05:49.500 --> 1:06:09.500]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:21.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:31.500]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:32.500]  We are back.
[1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:37.500]  Second hour of the Sunday transmission here every Sunday live at 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:06:37.500 --> 1:06:42.500]  The Sunday show has just exploded to, I don't know, close to 80 something affiliates, the
[1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:43.500]  weekday broadcast.
[1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:44.500]  I don't know.
[1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:50.500]  It might be getting five affiliates, six affiliates a week, and I mean big stations, 50,000 waters,
[1:06:50.500 --> 1:06:53.500]  you know, but we love every one of them.
[1:06:53.500 --> 1:06:57.500]  The fact that my radio show is becoming more and more accepted because people go and look
[1:06:57.500 --> 1:07:03.500]  up the facts I'm claiming, the fact that my radicalism is now becoming more and more mainstream
[1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:09.500]  shows that America is waking up because I haven't changed other than becoming more and
[1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.500]  more myself over the years.
[1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:14.500]  And people realize there is a world government.
[1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:17.500]  There are foreign banks bragging about conquering us.
[1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:20.500]  They are training the military for gun confiscation.
[1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:22.500]  That's even in mainstream news.
[1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:28.500]  They are running military checkpoints on highways in California and North Carolina.
[1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:30.500]  Here's one right here.
[1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:36.500]  South Carolina, military police used for crowd control in South Carolina on the highways
[1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:37.500]  at football games.
[1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:39.500]  I mean, W-I-S-T-V.
[1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:41.500]  This is so creepy.
[1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.500]  It's all happening.
[1:07:43.500 --> 1:07:44.500]  Why?
[1:07:44.500 --> 1:07:45.500]  People are like, hey, support the troops.
[1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:47.500]  The troops don't want to be on highway checkpoints.
[1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:50.500]  Why are we being acclimated for a collapse?
[1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:52.500]  Why are they training for civil unrest?
[1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:55.500]  Well, now the troops call in and go, well, we've been told we're getting ready for a
[1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:58.500]  financial collapse or hyperinflation or both.
[1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:04.500]  Yeah, and I've been telling you this at least since 1998 with economists like George Humphrey
[1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:05.500]  here on the show.
[1:08:05.500 --> 1:08:07.500]  By the way, I want George Humphrey back on, guys.
[1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:11.500]  I know he lives in like five different countries, such a successful businessman and his owner,
[1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:12.500]  right?
[1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:14.500]  Former city councilman here in Austin, good friend of mine.
[1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:17.500]  But I mean, it was the first guy who said, you know what derivatives are, Alex?
[1:08:17.500 --> 1:08:18.500]  Well, this is who owns them.
[1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:19.500]  This is who runs them.
[1:08:19.500 --> 1:08:20.500]  This is what they're going to do.
[1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:21.500]  I said, how long, George?
[1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:23.500]  Oh, about 10 to 15 years.
[1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:24.500]  Then they'll implode it all.
[1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:26.500]  I mean, it's just, wow, it's all happening.
[1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:28.500]  And so here we are.
[1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:30.500]  What do you think they're gearing up for?
[1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:32.500]  Are you concerned about what's happening?
[1:08:32.500 --> 1:08:36.500]  And after I take a bunch of calls, I'm going to get into all over the country.
[1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:40.500]  They're telling people it's the law to take vaccines when it's not.
[1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:45.500]  Rick Perry came out five years ago and said it was the law for little girls to take Gardasil.
[1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:49.500]  It was all a hoax.
[1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:51.500]  And that destroyed his career.
[1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:55.500]  I agree with AP and Politico and others because they did the polling.
[1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:57.500]  There was no law.
[1:08:57.500 --> 1:08:59.500]  There is no law to take any of these shots.
[1:08:59.500 --> 1:09:00.500]  They're liars.
[1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:02.500]  And I'm going to expose Big Pharma.
[1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:04.500]  But let's go to your calls right now.
[1:09:04.500 --> 1:09:11.500]  Dan Abe, Karen, Leah, Chris, Andrew, Michael, Malcolm, Anonymous, Tobias.
[1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:12.500]  We're getting to all of you.
[1:09:12.500 --> 1:09:16.500]  Dan in Knoxville, Tennessee, where I know we're blasting out.
[1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:19.500]  Tell us what affiliate you're listening to, sir.
[1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:25.500]  We're listening to WNOX 100.3 in Knox, Vegas.
[1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:27.500]  It is a giant blowtorch.
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:28.500]  We're glad to be on there.
[1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:30.500]  What's on your mind today, sir?
[1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:33.500]  Well, first off, I just wanted to thank you, first-time caller.
[1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:40.500]  I just want to thank you for your service to the country, formerly known as America under the Constitutional Republic.
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:41.500]  Yes, sir.
[1:09:41.500 --> 1:09:43.500]  Under the Globalist Rule.
[1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:46.500]  But there's a lot of things I wanted to get to.
[1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:54.500]  But first off, I just wanted to let you know the New York Order is not getting anywhere in Tennessee.
[1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:58.500]  Everybody I've talked to around here, I'm trying to wake people up constantly.
[1:09:58.500 --> 1:10:00.500]  And you're totally right.
[1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:04.500]  The general public is completely dumbed down.
[1:10:04.500 --> 1:10:07.500]  People are either totally dumbed down and not awake or they're awake.
[1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:14.500]  But I've found of all the places in the country, Texas and Tennessee, I've got to say are probably the most awake out there per capita.
[1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:18.500]  That's probably because Tennessee founded Texas, so we all know that.
[1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:22.500]  So, yeah, yesterday there's some Boy Scouts selling popcorn at the grocery store.
[1:10:22.500 --> 1:10:25.500]  And I just asked one of the moms that was out there with the Boy Scouts.
[1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:27.500]  I was like, is that genetically modified corn?
[1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:29.500]  And she goes, I don't know what that is.
[1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:30.500]  And I was like, look it up.
[1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:32.500]  It causes sterilization.
[1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:34.500]  And they're like, OK, we'll look it up.
[1:10:34.500 --> 1:10:36.500]  And I was like, please, really look it up.
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:37.500]  Well, that's what I do.
[1:10:37.500 --> 1:10:38.500]  I mean, I don't just talk on the radio.
[1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:40.500]  I warn people everywhere.
[1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:47.500]  I saw this woman who was a nurse with her kid at Walgreens where they got all the signs with a flu shot.
[1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:49.500]  And I just had to say something to them.
[1:10:49.500 --> 1:10:54.500]  I said, please go look up the Canadian government study and others that when you take the flu shot,
[1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:58.500]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu that year and the next.
[1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:00.500]  And I said, look up flu shots Alzheimer's.
[1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:02.500]  And she said, OK, I will.
[1:11:02.500 --> 1:11:04.500]  But most nurses I talked to already know it.
[1:11:04.500 --> 1:11:06.500]  They're just like, what do we do?
[1:11:06.500 --> 1:11:08.500]  They say, we're fired if we don't take it.
[1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:10.500]  Well, sue them.
[1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:11.500]  Start saying no.
[1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:16.500]  I mean, America had more freedom than any other country because we stood up and demanded it.
[1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:20.500]  You don't get freedom lying down to, quote, authority,
[1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:24.500]  especially when that authority is absolutely tyrannical.
[1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:29.500]  These vaccines and all this aluminum that we're getting from multiple sources is increasing the Alzheimer's.
[1:11:29.500 --> 1:11:31.500]  Not to mention the autism.
[1:11:31.500 --> 1:11:38.500]  But listen, like the writing is on the wall and just to all your listeners, only an idiot wouldn't prepare for this.
[1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:40.500]  It's going to be...
[1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:42.500]  Why do you think they're gearing up for...
[1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:47.500]  I mean, now they admit they're gearing up for what they call civil emergency or martial law.
[1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:49.500]  What do you think is going on?
[1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:58.500]  Well, my personal opinion is that there's no question it's definitely going to be a declared natural emergency
[1:11:58.500 --> 1:12:01.500]  and martial law because of one of three things.
[1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:07.500]  A false flag, number one, a war, number two, or a monetary collapse, number three.
[1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:11.500]  And it's one of those things just like with the QE, unlimited.
[1:12:11.500 --> 1:12:14.500]  We're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't.
[1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:18.500]  So it's just a matter of, you look at Iceland.
[1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:22.500]  They had a peaceful revolution and their economy is rebounding.
[1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:24.500]  They're the only country to throw the bankers out.
[1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:27.500]  The bankers three years ago said, and I appreciate your call for those that don't know,
[1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:30.500]  you can look it up, so we had members of their parliament on.
[1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:35.500]  There's only 400,000 people in the whole country, but very smart, you know, hardworking people.
[1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:39.500]  And they said, oh, you owe, you know, was it $10 billion?
[1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:42.500]  It was like something like 300 something thousand per person.
[1:12:42.500 --> 1:12:43.500]  You can look this up.
[1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:46.500]  And they said no, they protested for over a year.
[1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:51.500]  They just stopped, they just shut society down in Rakiavec, their capital.
[1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:54.500]  And then when they threw out the ministers and arrested the other ministers,
[1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:58.500]  they found out 93% of all the debt was not theirs.
[1:12:58.500 --> 1:12:59.500]  It was foreign banks.
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:01.500]  They'd signed them on to the bankers debt.
[1:13:01.500 --> 1:13:03.500]  Same thing in Europe, same thing here.
[1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:07.500]  The Federal Reserve creates the debt, it's private, and then it signs us on to it
[1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:13.500]  and tells us our $15 trillion debt is the whole debt of 1.5 quadrillion.
[1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:15.500]  99% of the debt is theirs.
[1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:16.500]  It's not ours.
[1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:18.500]  All right, let's just stop right there for just a moment.
[1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:20.500]  I want to keep going to your calls a little bit quicker here,
[1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:24.500]  but while we're talking, the crew is pulling up articles.
[1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:29.500]  They pulled up ABC News, ABC with a major Canadian government study.
[1:13:29.500 --> 1:13:33.500]  There's two of them in Canada alone that the flu shot gives you the flu.
[1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:34.500]  Put that back on screen.
[1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:35.500]  That was great.
[1:13:35.500 --> 1:13:36.500]  That Mercola article is halfway down.
[1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:38.500]  It shows the ABC link.
[1:13:38.500 --> 1:13:39.500]  Move down.
[1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:40.500]  There it is.
[1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:45.500]  New study confirms flu vaccine really does increase your risk of serious pandemic and flu illness.
[1:13:45.500 --> 1:13:50.500]  Folks, it just came out that the major vaccine makers are putting it in the vaccines
[1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:54.500]  to cause the epidemics of MMR, you name it.
[1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:56.500]  That's in mainstream news.
[1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:58.500]  This is not my opinion.
[1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:01.500]  It's over the top, folks.
[1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:03.500]  Let's go ahead and cram in another here.
[1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:07.500]  Abe in Middle Tennessee, another call from Tennessee.
[1:14:07.500 --> 1:14:08.500]  How are you listening, Abe?
[1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:09.500]  Hey, man.
[1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:10.500]  How's it going?
[1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:11.500]  Good.
[1:14:11.500 --> 1:14:12.500]  How are you listening?
[1:14:12.500 --> 1:14:13.500]  I'm listening pretty good.
[1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.500]  I'm listening to that last dude.
[1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:17.500]  Dan, I guess the name was from Knoxville.
[1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:18.500]  Yes, sir.
[1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:20.500]  I'm listening to all of the same radio stations as him.
[1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:26.500]  And for you to know up here in Tennessee, we're not having this stuff, period.
[1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:34.500]  And the point being is that I live in a small town about 90 miles away from Knoxville.
[1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:41.500]  But I live in a town full of, I guess you would say, old country men and women and stuff,
[1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:42.500]  and they're not going to give up nothing.
[1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:47.500]  Well, that's why they're listed by Homeland Security, rural, conservative, libertarian,
[1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:50.500]  and veterans as the number one enemy of the globalist.
[1:14:50.500 --> 1:14:54.500]  Well, that's another point I was going to bring up to you real quick, is that it kind
[1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:58.500]  of freaked me out because I've been listening to you for about two years.
[1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:04.500]  And all of a sudden, I saw in the newspaper in my town I live in, we got a mobile FEMA
[1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:11.500]  trailer in my county, which is like, like maybe 14,000 people in this.
[1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:12.500]  That's a pretty big county.
[1:15:12.500 --> 1:15:15.500]  There's a lot more cows than there are people.
[1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:19.500]  And it kind of struck me like, why would they bring that up here?
[1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:23.500]  And there's a National Guard Armory, too, right down the street from where I live at.
[1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:26.500]  Okay, so we know what you've been talking about.
[1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:32.500]  Oh yeah, just this week they had mass inoculation drills nationwide where they got thousands
[1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:35.500]  of participants to take real shots at the events.
[1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:37.500]  And again, it's medical tyranny.
[1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:46.500]  You can use a bio attack or just a hyped up epidemic as the pretext to bring in more control
[1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:49.500]  and then the emergency never ends.
[1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:53.500]  It's like after 9-11, we never got our liberties back.
[1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:55.500]  Thank you for listening on WNOX out there.
[1:15:55.500 --> 1:16:00.500]  We'll be right back with more of your calls. Stay with us.
[1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:01.500]  Aaron Fullen here.
[1:16:01.500 --> 1:16:05.500]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are
[1:16:05.500 --> 1:16:09.500]  losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home-crafted sources
[1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:12.500]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:16.500]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:19.500]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[1:16:19.500 --> 1:16:23.500]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:27.500]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:32.500]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porches, Koreans eat kamichi, and
[1:16:32.500 --> 1:16:35.500]  in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:36.500]  But here's some good news.
[1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:40.500]  Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:42.500]  foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:45.500]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:48.500]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.
[1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:50.500]  That's fermentationfactor.com.

[1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:37.500]  parts for the life of the unit.

[1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:37.500]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:42.500]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:44.500]  Propure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[1:18:44.500 --> 1:18:46.500]  It's what my family uses.
[1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:49.500]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Propure.

[1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:06.500]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access,
[1:19:06.500 --> 1:19:10.500]  not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods
[1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:12.500]  like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.

[1:20:21.500 --> 1:20:28.500]  That's right, crashing through the lies and disinformation, waging war on corruption.
[1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:30.500]  Thank you for joining us here on the Sunday Transmission.
[1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:40.500]  By the way, when I get into vaccines later, I've got the CDC's own 20-page handout on side effects and deaths.
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:44.500]  And then I'm going to read mainstream news telling you there are no side effects from vaccines.
[1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:49.500]  I mean, it's just all the big hoax, and I'm tired of it.
[1:20:49.500 --> 1:20:54.500]  So that is coming up, and I'm going to tell you where to get this at the CDC website if you're a radio listener.
[1:20:54.500 --> 1:20:58.500]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, you can see it all right there, because it's flu season,
[1:20:58.500 --> 1:21:02.500]  and they are hyping these shots that, well, give you the flu in most cases.
[1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:05.500]  Everybody I know is figuring this out, though, because they're like, yeah, I never had the flu.
[1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:07.500]  I took it and almost killed me.
[1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:09.500]  Yeah, just incredible.
[1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:12.500]  So that is all coming up.
[1:21:12.500 --> 1:21:17.500]  Right now, let's go to Tobias in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[1:21:17.500 --> 1:21:19.500]  Then we'll go to Karen and others.
[1:21:19.500 --> 1:21:21.500]  Tobias calling us from Denmark.
[1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:22.500]  Welcome.
[1:21:22.500 --> 1:21:23.500]  Alex.
[1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:24.500]  Yes.
[1:21:24.500 --> 1:21:26.500]  Okay, yes.
[1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:28.500]  I have three issues.
[1:21:28.500 --> 1:21:30.500]  You turned me into a pro-life.
[1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:32.500]  I used to be for abortion.
[1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:33.500]  I'm not anymore.
[1:21:33.500 --> 1:21:34.500]  I want to thank you.
[1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:36.500]  Thank you, sir.
[1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:49.500]  And I have just seen that my local swings have begun to write the urine all over it and the insignia and how they're helping the world all over the place, while they're not.
[1:21:49.500 --> 1:21:54.500]  I can see from what the reports you're coming with.
[1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:55.500]  Oh, yeah, no, no, no.
[1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:58.500]  I have a cyber news service report, and I went and looked it up.
[1:21:58.500 --> 1:21:59.500]  It's even in mainstream news.
[1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:12.500]  They're now setting up these FEMA core high schoolers that are going to patrol the streets, telling people and writing mock tickets and calling police for environmental infractions and wasting energy.
[1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:14.500]  They're going to be called energy patrols.
[1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:15.500]  Does it?
[1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:18.500]  I mean, Mao Zedong would be proud.
[1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:20.500]  It's insane.
[1:22:20.500 --> 1:22:25.500]  And also the World Health Organization and their vaccines all over the world.
[1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:26.500]  It's insane.
[1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:42.500]  And also one more thing, I have an idea for the army, not any kind of dangerous stuff, but try to circumvent the general elections and hold their own election and show the public which candidate they would support.
[1:22:42.500 --> 1:22:57.500]  By the way, I saw, I saw, I think it was AP guys try to pull it up earlier than we can ever cover it because I had so much on my plate.
[1:22:57.500 --> 1:23:01.500]  For the first time ever, they're just not giving the military the ballots.
[1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:07.500]  They're just not sending them out because they know the military is absolutely against the Obamination.
[1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:14.500]  And again, even if you don't like the other guy, the point is the veterans, the act of duty, don't they have a right to vote as well?
[1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:18.500]  Not according to Obama and his people.
[1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:20.500]  Yeah, yes.
[1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:21.500]  Are you receiving me?
[1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:22.500]  Yes, sir.
[1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:23.500]  I'm sorry.
[1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:24.500]  I'm just adding points.
[1:23:24.500 --> 1:23:26.500]  What else is on your mind there from Denmark?
[1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:39.500]  Oh, yeah, taxes. I mean, we have around a minimum of 40% tax rate and a 25% that weight and a lot of other kinds of taxes.
[1:23:39.500 --> 1:23:42.500]  So I think we should reduce all those.
[1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:51.500]  And one more thing, David, I am looking forward to hear his presentation on the 27th of October.
[1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:59.500]  I can't wait to hear what he has to say about the New World Order and everything that is on his mind.
[1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:06.500]  Well, you have the former Czech Republic president just exposing and he's come out and said, this is an authoritarian takeover.
[1:24:06.500 --> 1:24:13.500]  I could have never imagined when I was fighting the Soviets 20 years ago that we would be taken over by the EU tyranny.
[1:24:13.500 --> 1:24:17.500]  In fact, he just came out a few weeks ago and said that just incredible.
[1:24:17.500 --> 1:24:19.500]  Anything else, sir?
[1:24:19.500 --> 1:24:27.500]  No, I just want to wish you well and I hope you save your republic and spread 76 all over the world.
[1:24:27.500 --> 1:24:30.500]  Well, God bless you, sir, and say hi to everybody over there in Denmark.
[1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:33.500]  My wife lived there for a couple of years.
[1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:37.500]  Her dad was a diplomat and she said it was the most beautiful place she ever lived in.
[1:24:37.500 --> 1:24:38.500]  I've never been there.
[1:24:38.500 --> 1:24:40.500]  I'd like to go there someday.
[1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:42.500]  Let's go ahead and jam in more calls.
[1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:47.500]  Karen in Arizona, formerly Arizona, FEMA Region 9.
[1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:51.500]  Welcome from FEMA Region 9 in occupied United States.
[1:24:51.500 --> 1:24:52.500]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:54.500]  I got a couple of things to mention.
[1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:58.500]  First of all, I think it's going to be a combination of all.
[1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:15.500]  Second of all, that the people are getting educated on the genetic modified organism right now because I went to my local health food store and they're selling seeds of deception.
[1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:22.500]  Also, I went to that sustainability conference on August 17th.
[1:25:22.500 --> 1:25:27.500]  So I just say I didn't see one picketer or protest.
[1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:32.500]  For those that don't know, the UN said this three and a half years ago at Copenhagen at that big meeting.
[1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:37.500]  They said, we can't get Congress to let the US be taken over fully by the UN.
[1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:44.500]  We're going to come in with federal bureaucratic money and buy off the cities and counties every town around Austin.
[1:25:44.500 --> 1:25:49.500]  And where I live in Austin is officially the world model of UN governance.
[1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:58.500]  And I am under UN government in Austin, only county in Texas where we have to pay for the abortions with taxpayer money at the county level.
[1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:00.500]  I mean, it is incredible.
[1:26:00.500 --> 1:26:10.500]  And of course, you were first mentioning for people when you called in because, again, you were kind of communicating like we're just talking privately.
[1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:12.500]  Why don't you flesh out exactly what you were talking about?
[1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:21.500]  Okay, they had a sustainability conference or they called it a retreat at the Prescott Resort in Prescott, Arizona.
[1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:28.500]  So I was hoping to get a lot of people there that would line up on 69 because that would have been perfect.
[1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:40.500]  I went ahead and after work, I went to hear Amanda Reeves talk about how she is getting her law degree in environmentalism
[1:26:40.500 --> 1:26:42.500]  and how she gave her still.
[1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:46.500]  So after that, I talked to her and educated her who really...
[1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:55.500]  You're not going to be able to investigate most of these people because they've gone and gotten degrees to be our minders, to be our bosses, to be the environmental police.
[1:26:55.500 --> 1:26:57.500]  And it's not environmentalism, it's communism.
[1:26:57.500 --> 1:26:58.500]  I appreciate your call.
[1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:00.500]  Great points on that front.
[1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:04.500]  And I'm glad the lady actually commented on my question to listeners.
[1:27:04.500 --> 1:27:06.500]  The big gear up for martial law.
[1:27:06.500 --> 1:27:09.500]  Is it going to be economic, a war, a bio attack?
[1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:12.500]  Part of this is preparations for bio attacks.
[1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:16.500]  But then we know the globalists are the ones that launched an anthrax attack against their own government.
[1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:17.500]  That later came out.
[1:27:17.500 --> 1:27:18.500]  U.S. government strain.
[1:27:18.500 --> 1:27:23.500]  Let's talk to Leah in Austin, Texas.
[1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:25.500]  How are you listening to us?
[1:27:25.500 --> 1:27:26.500]  Oh, of course.
[1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:27.500]  I'm KLBJ.
[1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:28.500]  590 a.m.
[1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:30.500]  Well, welcome.
[1:27:30.500 --> 1:27:31.500]  Thank you.
[1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:33.500]  Alex, long time, long time.
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.500]  Maybe almost a decade listener, but first time callers.
[1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:37.500]  Welcome.
[1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:39.500]  And thank you.
[1:27:39.500 --> 1:27:41.500]  And thank you for all you do.
[1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:42.500]  Certainly woke us up.
[1:27:42.500 --> 1:27:48.500]  But I just wanted to let you know that, you know, with the holidays coming up, I just wanted to let people know.
[1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:58.500]  Last December, we rented a car, hurt, you know, basic standard rent a car to go up to a very important family wedding after many deaths in the family.
[1:27:58.500 --> 1:28:00.500]  So this was our big time for fun.
[1:28:00.500 --> 1:28:07.500]  And we got to outside of St. Louis, we're in Missouri, and we got stopped for speeding.
[1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:10.500]  Apparently, it went from 70 to 60.
[1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.500]  We didn't notice.
[1:28:11.500 --> 1:28:12.500]  The guy was real nice.
[1:28:12.500 --> 1:28:15.500]  He said, you know, you have no tickets.
[1:28:15.500 --> 1:28:16.500]  You have no priors.
[1:28:16.500 --> 1:28:17.500]  You have nothing.
[1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:18.500]  I'm going to write a warning for you.
[1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:19.500]  And let me say this.
[1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:21.500]  My husband is 62.
[1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.500]  I'm 55.
[1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:26.500]  So, you know, okay, great.
[1:28:26.500 --> 1:28:35.500]  So he goes back to get this ticket, this warning, and the cop comes up a little while later and says, I'd like to talk to you about some stuff.
[1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:37.500]  I said, okay, but what can I help you with?
[1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:39.500]  Well, stay there.
[1:28:39.500 --> 1:28:40.500]  Let me guess.
[1:28:40.500 --> 1:28:43.500]  They have a political database, totally illegal.
[1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:44.500]  It's what the Soviet Union had.
[1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:46.500]  And he wanted to ask you about that.
[1:28:46.500 --> 1:28:47.500]  And they fill out these reports.
[1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:52.500]  Guys, print me the Senate report from this week about innocent Americans put on terror list.
[1:28:52.500 --> 1:28:55.500]  I don't know what your point is, man, but we're going to get to it right after this break.
[1:28:55.500 --> 1:28:56.500]  But I'm guessing that's what it is.
[1:28:56.500 --> 1:29:25.500]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:26.500 --> 1:29:52.500]  We'll be right back.
