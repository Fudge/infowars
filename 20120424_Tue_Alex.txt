[08:53.160 --> 09:01.000]  shouting at you it's all about making you think that you're bad it's all about getting
[09:01.000 --> 09:11.760]  in your face that's what this is all about and i see this all the time and they don't
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.640]  even carry of the shampoo bottles the right size they're always changing the rules they
[09:15.640 --> 09:22.040]  can yell at you it's about getting non-criminal people accustomed to being treated like prison
[09:22.040 --> 09:29.320]  inmates because the new world order model is turn everything in to a casualist society
[09:29.320 --> 09:35.000]  totally surveilled police state that's from the daily mail more news on the tsa front
[09:35.000 --> 09:49.160]  tsa leaves note telling passenger to go to hell scrawled comment on complaint form
[09:49.160 --> 09:56.200]  scrawled comment on complaint form after agents tampered with luggage and they had the proper
[09:56.200 --> 10:01.400]  type of locks but it doesn't matter they were angry and broke those off and then told them
[10:01.400 --> 10:08.680]  go to hell a lot of times they write notes about how they like a date or hey nice marijuana
[10:08.680 --> 10:14.440]  in your bag leave it in there if they're not robbing your backs and of course now they
[10:14.440 --> 10:20.520]  put on the news hollywood stars tv stars public figures being grubbed their breasts being grabbed
[10:20.520 --> 10:25.800]  their children being grubbed to turn it into a gladiatorial spectacle for everyone all
[10:25.800 --> 10:31.640]  part of converting us from land of the free home of the brave to freedom is a pervert
[10:34.280 --> 10:40.360]  molesting your family that is the new american flag should be replaced with a potbelly
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.160]  groping a child and that should be it the pellet the pedophile states of america
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.920]  i'm serious i mean that's what we've become we need to admit how pathetic this is and
[10:50.920 --> 10:57.400]  reject it and that's starting to happen but we've got to fully reject their criminal activity by
[10:57.400 --> 11:04.200]  the way the u.s. has gotten so bad that historic wave of mexican immigration at a standstill report
[11:04.200 --> 11:11.560]  says uh illegals are leaving at a record rate and the increase has slowed to now a standstill
[11:11.560 --> 11:18.120]  well that's because the u.s. is in a depression that's because the u.s. is falling apart that's
[11:18.120 --> 11:23.800]  because the cheap labor lowered mexican standard of living in mexico and lowered the u.s. until the
[11:23.800 --> 11:30.280]  u.s. is a burnout husk and what's left of our tax money is paid to general motors to move to china
[11:30.280 --> 11:36.600]  to build the vaults and catalogs there and to brazil and to mexico and to eastern europe
[11:38.120 --> 11:44.520]  you paid 20 plus billion of the bailout to move the factories let me say that again
[11:44.520 --> 11:52.360]  and now the factories are opening and and and what's the new scholarship a homeland security
[11:52.360 --> 12:00.920]  official what's the new job prison guard that's the new economy there's a story that's up at
[12:00.920 --> 12:08.040]  drudgereport.com again from the daily mail um that you know points out that drones launched by
[12:08.040 --> 12:13.880]  texas state university fbi gas and police department georgia tech research institute
[12:13.880 --> 12:21.320]  kansas state us air force arlington police department us army do d dhs department of
[12:21.320 --> 12:26.600]  homeland security against the american people and we have a map of that we can put up on screen if
[12:26.600 --> 12:34.840]  you're watching at prison planet dot tv but everybody is freaking out about this and you should
[12:34.840 --> 12:43.960]  but what's exempt is actual nsa drones and what's exempt is the solar powered blamps that are up
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.440]  in the edge of the atmosphere at over a hundred thousand feet that the news media abc news and
[12:48.440 --> 12:54.360]  others knows not to tell you it's a blimp larry king and abc i've played the clips here just look
[12:54.360 --> 13:01.320]  it up abc you know covers ufo over salt lake it's a blimp a giant blimp roughly two times the size of
[13:01.320 --> 13:12.040]  the uh good year blimp and it has propellers on it and engines and solar arrays on the side
[13:12.600 --> 13:17.800]  and they say that they believe it's aliens and larry king said it was you know aliens over
[13:17.800 --> 13:22.920]  dallas and it was a blimp because you can't say it's a giant secret government blimp so that'd be
[13:22.920 --> 13:29.960]  like if you saw a biplane fly by with the red baron on the side the iron cross and it had surveillance
[13:29.960 --> 13:36.360]  cameras the news would say it's an alien from planet gobble snap with the reptoid flying it
[13:36.360 --> 13:42.600]  because you couldn't have surveillance that doesn't exist in the free country so it's et
[13:45.000 --> 13:50.440]  cnn abc other newscasts as well but i've played the both those here where they go what is it
[13:50.440 --> 13:59.960]  giant cigar shaped craft it's surveillance drones i even went and looked up where the contracts were
[13:59.960 --> 14:07.400]  paid in the late 90s and then in the early 2000s and when they launched some it was actually on msnbc
[14:10.280 --> 14:14.360]  that it was a blimp but still when i have national media call me they say you believe
[14:14.360 --> 14:18.040]  in these blimps and i'm like yeah let me show you they're like no we're not going to look
[14:18.040 --> 14:21.880]  we just want to ask you you believe they exist not that national media repeatedly i go
[14:22.440 --> 14:28.520]  but i want to show you the blimp and they go no it's your opinion why do you believe in these
[14:28.520 --> 14:33.800]  blimps why do you believe the bad men are coming remember jesse ventura when he went to that congressman
[14:33.800 --> 14:38.200]  with the emergency centers establishment act with all the fema camps and the funding
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.920]  and he goes i'd like to know about this bill and he goes the bill where the green aliens come out of
[14:42.920 --> 14:48.440]  the big machines and eat me ventura goes no the bill and he goes they mean with the one with the
[14:48.440 --> 14:53.000]  aliens and ventura looks at me says no here's the bill here here's the bill number and he goes
[14:53.000 --> 15:01.320]  i do remember that bill and then it was so embarrassing for him when the hoax was shown
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.680]  homeland security threatened time-warnered they removed that show and erased it off your dvars
[15:06.680 --> 15:13.800]  again this is the globalist operation there's no world government but you're announcing it in hundreds
[15:13.800 --> 15:19.240]  of papers still isn't there and the american psychological association has put out a new
[15:19.240 --> 15:23.160]  psychological designation last year where if you believe in a world government you're mentally ill
[15:24.040 --> 15:28.520]  doesn't matter if you're reading it out of the economist and out of time magazine news week
[15:28.520 --> 15:32.680]  all of them announcing bankers are going to run everything you'll pay your carbon taxes of them
[15:32.680 --> 15:40.120]  global government global banker it's still it doesn't exist okay do you mean mr vent mr
[15:40.120 --> 15:45.320]  governor the aliens that come out of machines and eat me and he's like no i'm talking about
[15:45.320 --> 15:53.880]  this bill and he goes doesn't exist i control reality hey here's the blimp here's the funding
[15:53.880 --> 15:59.720]  for him doesn't exist hey hey here's the reports that uh all these major vaccines have cancer
[15:59.720 --> 16:05.080]  viruses in them and here's the numbers of the massive increase in cancer no the government's nice
[16:06.520 --> 16:10.360]  hey the tsa is violating laws and aren't even bonded police
[16:10.360 --> 16:14.440]  sticking their hands down your pants you can't do that the body scanners give you cancer
[16:14.440 --> 16:18.680]  no they don't they're good for you john hopkins says really the head of john hopkins says their
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.880]  report says the opposite you're lying we don't grope there's no radiation you're lying we don't
[16:23.880 --> 16:33.480]  script search all women you're lying no we're not extremist dhs uses wartime mega camera to
[16:33.480 --> 16:37.720]  watch border there's one of the blimps yeah usually when they do admit the blimps and stuff
[16:37.720 --> 16:44.840]  that's a little one it's oh it's just for the border that's just a world war one style uh hydrogen
[16:44.840 --> 16:50.760]  or helium system that they use with cameras today they used to put spotters up in them uh for artillery
[16:50.760 --> 16:56.920]  direction that's an artillery direction blip that they've uh rigged uh for the uh
[17:01.320 --> 17:03.560]  when they you know put on these little shows for the border
[17:09.560 --> 17:18.120]  so my point is everybody's freaking out about the drones but what about the blimps and the
[17:18.120 --> 17:24.280]  satellites i mean rockets are going off every week with new satellites some of them giant payloads
[17:24.280 --> 17:29.640]  some of these spy satellites are so big they've got to use russian boosters to get them into orbit
[17:30.440 --> 17:37.480]  and they're the size of two or three school buses up there uh amateur astronomers have used their
[17:37.480 --> 17:43.560]  telescopes and even amateur radio telescopes there's big platforms up in space things that make the
[17:43.560 --> 17:49.720]  see see they've gotten rid of the space shuttle program because it's a 1930s idea of verner ron
[17:49.720 --> 17:55.160]  bron the nazi who then became one of the heads of nasa who was the head of development launched in
[17:55.160 --> 18:01.880]  the early 80s 30 something years ago that's just the public space program and now that you're not
[18:01.880 --> 18:08.040]  into it anymore they're like we don't have a space program go to sleep the real space program 80 plus
[18:08.040 --> 18:14.120]  percent of it has always been a clandestine program and belongs to the bankers with our money
[18:15.640 --> 18:19.480]  and so that's all that's happening now since you're not into the fake space program
[18:20.120 --> 18:25.960]  in the $300 toilet seats and $700 hammers that is really being used for the black site government
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.120]  since you don't even care about anymore they're just like hey congress we're not going to tell
[18:30.120 --> 18:34.520]  you what's at the nsa base we're not going to tell you what's in the pdd 51 and we're not going to
[18:34.520 --> 18:40.120]  tell the public either so sit down and shut up and we're going to shoot your kids up even if you
[18:40.120 --> 18:50.200]  say no is that clear you will take the shot you will die of cancer and the illegals are like leaving
[18:51.160 --> 18:57.480]  in many cases because america is collapsing but they lie to us and say oh america is wonderful
[18:57.480 --> 19:05.960]  the economy has turned around yeah 20 plus billion to ship general motors to china and brazil and
[19:05.960 --> 19:14.120]  mexico and three different eastern european countries man it's great isn't it everything's fine
[19:14.120 --> 19:21.000]  there's nothing wrong with that picture we just don't grasp how it's a great idea
[19:21.000 --> 19:28.440]  the globalist have they openly said they wanted to wreck our economy and post industrial and teach
[19:28.440 --> 19:33.720]  us their enemy by by by destroying our economy and then inducting us into socialism just like

[25:09.800 --> 25:15.240]  footnote in the article or at fairs or on their front porches there'll be little footnotes that
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.440]  well yes witnesses said it was a group of 20 or 30 black people doing it to a white person
[25:20.440 --> 25:27.160]  who begged and pleaded and in some cases the people are dying later and the police will not
[25:27.160 --> 25:34.600]  even say the race in their report that is mind control again because the system wants white
[25:34.600 --> 25:39.160]  guilt not to try to empower and build up black people they want to keep them right where they
[25:39.160 --> 25:45.400]  are on the government reservation the government plantation but so they can say you're guilty

[26:25.400 --> 26:31.480]  cannot say just we're looking for some people it actually gets into that in the article mobile police

[26:39.160 --> 26:44.280]  well he's why he deserves to die what the black panthers say time to burn down american time
[26:44.280 --> 26:49.400]  to start killing some crackers and turned out the justice department was in those protests leading them
[26:49.400 --> 26:54.280]  the justice department that ships guns into mexico to kill two thousand plus mexicans

[33:29.240 --> 33:34.200]  well speaking of msnbc now that they think they've demonized ron paul and they think that he
[33:34.200 --> 33:38.440]  won't win the republican nomination they're trying to gain credibility about reporting what is the
[33:38.440 --> 33:47.000]  fact ron paul did in fact win iowa and minnesota after recounts that was a dead giveaway whenever
[33:47.000 --> 33:53.560]  carl rove went on fox and said some some trucks with the ballots didn't get delivered so uh we we
[33:53.560 --> 33:59.320]  met behind closed doors with the top officials and we decided uh that it would be mit romney and
[33:59.320 --> 34:05.240]  then santorum and then paul i mean that's called hiding it in plain view uh we decided to drop by
[34:05.240 --> 34:12.360]  your house and beat your head in with a baseball bat so he really won main that's even the new
[34:12.360 --> 34:18.280]  work times admits that he won main but the republican officials say we're not giving it to uh he won
[34:18.280 --> 34:24.920]  iowa he won minnesota and see that was all early on he would have gained the momentum he was the
[34:24.920 --> 34:28.680]  frontrunner and they kept saying he can't win he can't win no one wants him forget he's winning
[34:28.680 --> 34:33.080]  the straw polls and scientific polls he's gonna lose he's gonna lose he's gonna lose he can't
[34:33.080 --> 34:39.160]  win and then when he started winning they had to steal those then it began well i guess he
[34:39.160 --> 34:45.320]  didn't gonna win well that's funny all i see is ron paul stickers he's got 10 000 or more people at
[34:45.320 --> 34:51.240]  all his rallies and uh mit romney can't even get 500 and newt genrich can't even get 50 people
[34:51.240 --> 34:56.280]  and santorum can only get about 100 why wow it's just weird and he's he gets all the military
[34:56.280 --> 35:01.800]  donations 70 plus percent and you know you really have thought but i guess and then as they stole
[35:01.800 --> 35:07.160]  all the states nevada he clearly won but we can't 100 prove that we know and now they admitted he
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.360]  won iowa he won main he won minnesota so now admit it but it's like back of the paper yeah
[35:13.480 --> 35:19.240]  she up front they didn't want you to know he wasn't just a contender he was your president
[35:19.240 --> 35:24.760]  he would have gotten the nomination he would have defeated obama they probably would have put
[35:24.760 --> 35:29.400]  a bullet in him and he was ready for that he said he's ready to go all the way but by going through
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.920]  the process showing the cheating showing the manipulation we show the emperor is butt naked
[35:35.880 --> 35:42.120]  he's not wearing a fine coat and he educates people on the federal reserve and we win and he'll
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.840]  be at ut this thursday i bet there's 10 000 people out there i know i'll have news crews out there
[35:46.840 --> 35:56.600]  and you know his son was able to win because he won by fit all the polls showed 15 17 points or so
[35:57.720 --> 36:02.440]  hey bill clinton went and campaigned against him his numbers went up they tried to block him out of
[36:02.440 --> 36:07.480]  early debates you know the republicans went after him and the the democrats went after him
[36:07.480 --> 36:15.480]  but kentucky had such a landslide that they let rand paul in that there's still some places where
[36:15.480 --> 36:19.720]  it can happen you know where ron paul's one congressional seat before by over 80 percent
[36:21.400 --> 36:28.520]  polls are showing he's getting 80 plus percent he wins by 61 you see they can only steal him right
[36:28.520 --> 36:35.480]  now when it's 5 10 points past that and i've had top election fraud experts on from every angle
[36:36.200 --> 36:41.880]  the collier brothers before they died uh the collier brothers uh well one of the collier
[36:41.880 --> 36:48.760]  brothers daughter all the investigators uh bev harris on and on i went and worked at elections
[36:50.600 --> 37:01.800]  in state elections what in 94 96 2000 i was there i saw pat bucannon winning travis county he got
[37:01.800 --> 37:06.440]  i think it was like three four percent i forget on the news at the end of the night
[37:06.440 --> 37:12.280]  he won a rezone of that fraud came out pat bucannon was who people wanted to run against
[37:12.280 --> 37:19.240]  bill clinton and the system's like no we're gonna run a corpse we're gonna run bob dole and he's
[37:19.240 --> 37:23.560]  going to take a fall i mean it would be like putting a 10 year old child in the ring with
[37:23.560 --> 37:30.120]  mike dyson and they did it it was a don king fight it was totally rigged and you know what don king
[37:30.120 --> 37:35.960]  ran enough rig fights people don't watch him anymore pay reviews a joke a new sport came along
[37:35.960 --> 37:41.800]  that was real and not rigged i'll tell you fc is not rigged at all and it's wildly popular like boxing
[37:41.800 --> 37:49.960]  used to be because there's five or six different groups competing and competition with the different
[37:49.960 --> 37:58.680]  leagues brings reality monopolies brings stagnation so hey don king you know arrested for murder all
[37:58.680 --> 38:05.080]  this stuff gangsterism people finally figured out these are staged fights they weren't back
[38:05.080 --> 38:10.920]  during the mohammed ali days but later they became rigged because they wanted to make even more on
[38:10.920 --> 38:15.720]  the rig gambling than they were making on the pay-per-view so you killed the golden goose
[38:16.440 --> 38:23.560]  globalism is the killing of the golden goose mafia insider cronyism is the death of everything good
[38:27.960 --> 38:30.840]  and so we've got the clip it's up at info wars dot com
[38:30.840 --> 38:38.680]  um where uh rachel maddow you know admits mr maddow admits that ron i mean miss maddow or
[38:38.680 --> 38:46.840]  mrs maddow whatever it is or the guy from saturday night live a pat the point is that
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.320]  they're now admitting it after they've done it oh look it was rigged like you're not part of the
[38:55.320 --> 39:01.480]  rigging and the editing of tapes to make zimmerman sound racist i mean you guys are caught okay
[39:02.520 --> 39:07.800]  nobody's coming to your fights anymore nobody's watching you anymore you're a shadow of your
[39:07.800 --> 39:17.240]  former self and soon you'll be a memory of a shadow you're gone so try to shut the web down
[39:17.240 --> 39:21.240]  try to intimidate people blow up some more federal buildings and blame it on us it isn't
[39:21.240 --> 39:26.360]  going to help you new world order it is and you know that that's why brzezinski's new book
[39:26.360 --> 39:30.600]  he elaborates on what he said two years ago he said the people are awake they're aware of the elite
[39:30.600 --> 39:35.880]  and there's a quote in there we can pull it up because it's actually on the amazon synopsis
[39:36.520 --> 39:44.360]  to paraphrase it and this is almost exact he said 30 years ago it was cheaper to just
[39:44.360 --> 39:55.720]  spend a million dollars convincing people to go along with your program now it's cheaper just to
[39:55.720 --> 39:59.960]  pay a million dollars to kill a million people guys pull up the exact quote because i butchered
[39:59.960 --> 40:04.040]  that i'm trying to get exactly right the point is he said it's cheaper just to kill people now
[40:04.600 --> 40:08.280]  so now they're like yeah we've been listening to you yeah we're jacking the food and water
[40:08.280 --> 40:13.480]  yeah we're building secret sites to arrest you yes yes we're federalizing everything you better

[42:57.960 --> 43:03.320]  that they stripped down naked begin screaming their god and that's what the head of county did
[43:04.360 --> 43:06.360]  uh that's what they all do
[43:11.720 --> 43:15.320]  and mike adams of course has put out a story i was going to call paul watson this morning but

[54:25.240 --> 54:31.640]  sign that's the type of action people are taking against this and it's a domino effect as more
[54:31.640 --> 54:36.840]  people do it there's going to be a cascading effect against tyranny speaking of cascading
[54:36.840 --> 54:43.560]  i'm going to cover this later after we take calls for the entire next hour five bill gates top growth
[54:43.560 --> 54:51.800]  picks mcdonald's walmart comcast now mcdonald's has board members on it from monsanto and by his gmo
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.440]  and bill gates is also on the board of monsanto and heavily invested same thing with walmart all
[54:56.440 --> 55:04.200]  these guys and he calls his holding group cascade they know what they're doing and this guy is a
[55:04.200 --> 55:11.800]  flaming eugenicist so erin dykes has got a blurb out on that he's also got a big report out about
[55:11.800 --> 55:18.760]  AIDS virus or the shell of the AIDS virus in biological pharmacological crop corn
[55:18.760 --> 55:23.800]  uh because erin heard me talk about that from eight nine years ago yesterday he went and dug it up
[55:23.800 --> 55:30.200]  and has an article uh out at info wars dot com uh on that right now it's in my stack i'll be covering
[55:30.200 --> 55:36.040]  that later there is so much i haven't even gotten to yet but just getting back to this announcement
[55:36.040 --> 55:43.080]  it's at info wars dot com the war on terror is over but the tsa because you know al-qaeda is now
[55:43.080 --> 55:46.840]  good we're told you know they've been given libya they're going to be given syria well they've
[55:46.840 --> 55:52.840]  been given pretty much control over uh other areas like egypt and it's like oh no they're good
[55:52.840 --> 55:57.960]  the new terrorist as they told us last year is white al-qaeda is domestic conservative libertarian
[55:57.960 --> 56:02.840]  returning veterans i told you four years ago that would be the new enemy and they would segue to that
[56:02.840 --> 56:09.400]  and now they've put out all these homeland security videos some of them are 30 minutes long they're
[56:09.400 --> 56:13.160]  they're little mini documentaries and every terrorist is a white person and every person

[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:34.200]  week go up and you know do normal clinic visits and they've been telling me now they're being forced
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:43.000]  to take new chicken pox vaccines or they're calling it for singles and and by the way there is no
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:47.400]  law that that you go to the the doctor and you've got to take a vaccine but they do more and more
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:54.200]  bullying and say you're gonna take this it's all about being pecked into submission had some back
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:57.960]  surgeries and all of a sudden before another surgery the doctor tells me well it looks like
[1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:04.280]  you're in need of a tetanus shot and i'm like what i why would i need a tetanus like they terrorize
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:11.240]  the doctors and nurses under obama care computers tell them everything and private practice you
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:16.440]  still may be able to survive a while but any of these big operations you're told what you're
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:21.560]  going to give somebody just like under the national health service in england where even if you want
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:26.040]  to go to a private doctor which exists for the elite they have to authorize you even if you want
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:31.240]  to pay for it went around because i've been listening to you now for almost a year and
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:36.840]  i'm so grateful i found you there's we used to be married to a farmer and i went around talked
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:42.280]  to a few of the farmers in the area and all they can grow now is monsanto seeds and these farmers
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:49.160]  had no clue what gmo's were they were unaware of the alternate pesticides that will go in
[1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:53.800]  one batch of seeds to kill you know pet you know the bugs or when all the monsanto chemicals are
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:04:00.200]  doing to the water table definitely i mean i'm like oh it's a new definition of killing yourself to
[1:04:00.200 --> 1:04:06.600]  live exactly and they're like and you had to sign contracts didn't you yeah you know i explained to
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:10.920]  them you know how cross pollination works how they've gone after farmers thing well you stole
[1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:17.000]  their seeds and it's all just a trap i you know i know of one organic farmer left in the area
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:22.760]  you know when i told his brother i said you might want to have him keep his eye out because if he's
[1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:28.120]  next to any other farmers that have to grow monsanto it can cross pollinate and they can come
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:33.640]  after him in a heartbeat and they can sneak people into his farm to take you know whatever crop he's
[1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:39.560]  growing corn usually or soybeans and take a test out of it and say no we found it in your seed
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:44.680]  and by the way it meant that they contaminated you but it's like we don't care we own the

[1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:47.080]  they did that to get everybody look in the other direction as a physicist if i went to the top of
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:55.160]  the uh world trade center threw my keys off in a vacuum those keys would take 9.25 seconds to fall
[1:13:55.160 --> 1:14:01.320]  and hit the ground now according to the 9 11 commission those buildings came down in 10 11
[1:14:01.320 --> 1:14:11.000]  seconds now in a vacuum and that's a physics equation in a vacuum those keys take 9.25 seconds
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:18.600]  those buildings did not fall and the person that really you need to you need to get on is
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:27.640]  dr judy wood who's a physicist and did a forensic study on this whole thing but when they brought
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:33.000]  down the building 7 they got everybody thinking that there were bombs and explosions and all the
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:40.120]  rest of it so the real question is what caused those buildings to dissolve not what caused them to fall
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:50.040]  well all i know is sir the official story is a complete fairy tale and everybody wants to
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:54.200]  argue the science which is a fairy tale what about the government saying they found two
[1:14:54.200 --> 1:15:01.080]  passports that day that survived made up what about us troops massing to invade afghanistan
[1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:07.080]  in the month before and bush signing launch orders the day before to attack afghanistan on
[1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:13.960]  september 10th what about all of that it goes on and on i mean i believe the control demolition
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:20.840]  of building 7 is absolutely key because we have them on video saying we're going to bring down
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:26.440]  building 7 and then blowing it up and then saying they never said that so if you can prove one part
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:35.480]  of it a lie it all falls i appreciate your call let's go ahead and talk to leah in florida you're on
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:42.360]  the air hi alex i'm calling from orange county florida i'm about 20 minutes outside of samford

[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:54.520]  deputy and he told me um that if under any circumstances if you see a suspicious person
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:16:00.040]  vehicle anything in your neighborhood you are to immediately call the police it is going to be the
[1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:07.320]  new quote unquote zimmerin rule we are no longer allowed to defend our property we are officially
[1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:15.000]  in any state because the cop told you and that's what he believes he says if he makes a rule i have
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.400]  a rule you got to let people come in your house and rape you and murder your children we're like

[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:39.080]  article by Paul Joseph Watson secretive Bilderberg group set to meet in Virginia May 31st June 3rd
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:45.880]  we were able to get the scoop last year that it would be in Switzerland and then it was in between
[1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:53.480]  St. Mort's and Geneva and we were able to confirm it was St. Moritz or Mort's and I was able to
[1:33:53.480 --> 1:34:09.880]  send Paul Watson and Aaron Dykes to that I can tell you now
[1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:15.800]  now we're going to go to
[1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:27.080]  Paul Watson here in a moment on this subject but obviously I will be going to Virginia if it is
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:36.600]  confirmed it's there and if they're stupid enough to have it at the same Chantilly Marriott conference
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:42.440]  center that's that's really good because you can you can really bullhorn the daylights out of them
[1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:47.000]  at that facility and maybe the New York Times will say it doesn't exist again
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:51.800]  maybe they'll choose who the president's going to be again at this meeting I mean they had the
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:35:03.160]  Washington Post a week and a half ago come out and say that oh yeah Rubio it looks like
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:07.880]  it's going to be picked by the Bilderberg group at a steering meeting well the presidents in
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:14.360]  South America Rubio is going to be vetted like other vice presidential candidates by Bilderberg
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:21.080]  they're having a steering meeting there so they've gone from saying it doesn't exist and the Washington
[1:35:21.080 --> 1:35:26.360]  Post has always attended since its founding in 54 in Eusterbeck Holland at the Bilderberg Hotel
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:33.400]  and so the fact that they would do that shows that we've basically completely blown their cover now
[1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:38.200]  but this will be a three-ring circus if that's the case now every four years they do have the
[1:35:38.200 --> 1:35:44.040]  meeting in North America four years ago it was Obama and Hillary and the motorcade and the machine
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:50.280]  guns and the plane closed Marines trying to set us up and I'm calling the media going you're looking
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:55.160]  for Obama he's been missing for today secret services drove in here and turned out he was there
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:36:00.920]  and the national media just said we're not interested thank you because they're a bunch of
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:12.040]  controlled sold-out whores I just talked to a national host last week who was at a big meeting
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:16.360]  and he said it's it's all true everything you talked about he was offered the whole deal
[1:36:16.360 --> 1:36:20.680]  but told you don't talk about about the new world order you don't talk about about Bilderberg you
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:26.280]  don't talk about the fellow reserve given the speech I mean of course we're owned by foreign banks
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:31.960]  the country is under a coup d'etat which is French for coup d'etat another attempted lame humor
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:38.040]  I'm gonna go back to your calls I want to hear from Joe who says he was ripped off by
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:42.520]  another global and they admit they did and it's just like we're keeping your money you don't like
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:48.760]  it go to go to a place it's very warm well the tsa worker right and put in the back for no reason
[1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:59.240]  go to Hades but I want to bring up on video skype from England Paul Watson who's broken this news
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:03.320]  and he's gotten it from Tony Gosling who's been a pretty good source of info in the past
[1:37:03.320 --> 1:37:10.920]  would at Bilderberg.org I'm going to check with Tucker or as the French say Tuquier and then I'm
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:15.960]  going to check with Mark Anderson as well one of the editors over American Free Press.net
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:20.200]  but they're always a little more conservative they want to be careful but we'll we'll find out
[1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:24.920]  from them by tomorrow what their take is on this maybe even today we got Lou Rockwell coming up
[1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:35.960]  Paul Watson big story up at infowars.com tell us about it well Alex I've been saying for weeks
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:41.400]  that all this speculation about the meeting in Haifa Israel was probably nonsense because they've
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:46.360]  never met outside of Europe or North America and then of course you had you've got the US
[1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:52.680]  presidential election which they routinely have an influence in picking the VP as in the case of
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:38:03.000]  John Edwards in 2004 and Barack Obama's VP Joe Biden back in 2008 so basically if you go on the
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:12.280]  Westfields Marriott hotel website which of course is where Bilderberg met both in 2002 and 2008 and
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:20.760]  you try and book a hotel room from May 31st which is a Thursday to June the 3rd which is a Sunday
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:26.440]  there are no rooms available if you book either side of those dates there are rooms available
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:33.400]  which suggests although it's not confirmed that that is where the 2012 Bilderberg meeting will
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:41.000]  take place of course they routinely not routinely but occasionally they will book a number of hotels
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:47.720]  as a decoy to try and throw people off the scent and even virtually the day before the Switzerland
[1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:53.480]  meeting last year some people thought it was a different hotel than it actually was so although
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:59.800]  the hotel's not confirmed it seems likely that it will be in Chantilly Virginia and it will be at
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:06.280]  the Westfields Marriott well looks like I'll have to saddle up in the Info Wars command bus and head
[1:39:06.280 --> 1:39:12.440]  my Texas hind in up there Paul perhaps we should get a tradition going and I should fly you into
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:20.040]  the main command base of the New World Order and have you there at the ceremonies this year
[1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:27.720]  well it's interesting because at the end of last year's conference myself and Aaron Dykes were
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:34.040]  having lunch with Mark Anderson and Jim Tucker just before we left the hotel and we were saying
[1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:41.320]  where do you think it's going to be next year and I said I think in regard to the nature walk
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:45.960]  that they had during last year's conference where they were confronted by a legion of
[1:39:45.960 --> 1:39:53.320]  demonstrators and shouted at that this year's event will be in some crap hole authoritarian
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:40:00.120]  country where people can be held back and harassed at the border checkpoints so it looks like that's
[1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:07.080]  the case it's in America so anybody who flies in is going to get the TSA now hold on I can call
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:14.200]  America in its current state of crap hole you can't but England's a crap hole too yeah the people who
[1:40:14.200 --> 1:40:19.480]  run it no no no exactly that's their view of it I understand they want to turn America
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:25.720]  UK and every other country into an agenda 21 uh festering cesspit is a more politically correct
[1:40:25.720 --> 1:40:33.000]  way to say it well yeah but I mean as Gosling points out they're going to be able to stop people
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:37.320]  from getting in and covering it just to shame for them that you know you're going to be there
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:42.440]  I expect we are changed they're going to be there so you know it sounds like a lot of fun
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:48.360]  that they're going to have once again well good job Watson but we're going to make you on assignment
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:54.840]  come here so I don't know whether I'd be better off writing all the articles about it but we can
[1:40:54.840 --> 1:41:01.560]  have that conversation I could be feeding you information you could be filling in on the show
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:13.000]  live coordinating while I am on the ground well yeah either way sounds like a sounds like a good deal
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:23.720]  you there on the air and me there on the ground feeding you feeding me folks that is a guys go
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:31.720]  to YouTube and type in um Dr. Strangelove mandrake feeds machine gun that's we have all this behind
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:37.640]  the scenes like like star wars is cheesy but it's fun to connect things to that but we also do it to
[1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:43.800]  Dr. Strangelove Stanley Kubrick's film and you've got uh mandrake who's the captain from Engel and
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:48.200]  assigned to the strategic air command and you've got general jack t ripper who's completely crazy
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:53.320]  launching a you know nuclear war under plan r and the army's coming to try to stop them to get the
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:58.840]  the recall codes before they bomb Russia and trigger the doomsday device and uh you know they're
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:03.240]  shooting machine guns into the windows and he's going hurry up mandrake the redcoats are coming
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:08.360]  go over that belt boy and feed me that and then later he's trying to get uh jack the ripper to
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:13.160]  a general ripper to give him the codes he's like jack come on boy you know I'm your friend
[1:42:13.160 --> 1:42:18.520]  you there with a gun me on the floor with the belt feeding you jack it's like I don't know how
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:25.640]  to stand up under torture mandrake I that's the idea a little wash in a brush off always gets you
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:31.800]  in the mood to give me the old the old codes Jackie the old codes I'm sorry people haven't seen the
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:38.600]  movie they don't understand anything else Paul yeah just one more thing talking about them possibly
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:43.880]  making it difficult for people to get in and cover it like they did with you in Canada in 2006
[1:42:43.880 --> 1:42:51.480]  Spain has announced or the the European Union has given Spain the green light that they're
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:57.320]  going to seal their border temporarily uh next week they're going to dispense with the Schengen
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:01.880]  agreement which is the free movement of peoples between European countries there's no border
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:09.480]  controls specifically to keep our anti-eu protesters because there's a big ECB summit
[1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:13.800]  in Barcelona where all these technocrats are going to get together and decide how to screw
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:19.320]  the European people even further and so the Spanish government has got the green light from the EU
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:26.040]  to completely revoke the Schengen agreement for a period of one week and so they're going to have
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:31.640]  tight border controls and they say they're going to stop anti-eu protesters from getting in into
[1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:36.680]  Spain well that's always been the plan the the the the border stuff here is to keep us in
[1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:43.880]  then not the people out they want more slaves here in the system and it's the same thing with
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:50.200]  the IRS saying that you know they want to pass this law where you can't travel if they say no
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:55.400]  judge no jury and and by the way this is going to be breaking I talked to Jim Mars this morning
[1:43:55.400 --> 1:44:03.640]  and sure enough it's in the Dallas observer for $110 the book building you know or Oswald
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:09.320]  supposedly shot the tree and all that along with the Kibler elves and killed Kennedy they are taking
[1:44:09.320 --> 1:44:15.480]  over for the two days of the anniversary the 50th next year of the JFK being murdered and no one
[1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:20.520]  is allowed in except the controlled media just like 9-11 they block half the city so you can't
[1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:25.400]  get in and protest it's an inside job now they're so worried everybody's going to come in at their
[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:31.560]  media event they're saying the public park of D. Lee Plaza in its entire hundred year history
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:37.480]  has never been closed it's closed to the public and they're leasing it for $110 and of course there
[1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:44.680]  should be lawsuits now if I can't lease it for $110 but you can't do that again they're so scared
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:50.200]  of us and so now next year at the 50th I'm going to be there and call for thousands to be there
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:53.800]  and and we're going to make it a media event it's going to backfire on them and even the local
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:45:00.360]  paper is saying it's wrong I mean it's pure authoritarianism Paul yeah they want to keep
[1:45:00.360 --> 1:45:06.680]  people out and it's like this EU thing you know the EU grandstands as this 21st century liberal
[1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:12.840]  democracy with a free movement of peoples isn't it ironic that the only time they suspend that right
[1:45:12.840 --> 1:45:19.320]  is to keep anti-EU protesters out of the country again underscoring their fundamentally authoritarian
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:25.400]  raison d'etre and let's be clear that means people from Germany and France and other countries
[1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:30.760]  that are just trying to come to Spain you know during the late spring early summer best time of
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:36.360]  the year to come oh you just can't come in now that's what it's all about it's for us notice Paul
[1:45:36.360 --> 1:45:41.080]  they've announced the war on terror is over but the TSA is going on the streets to search your bags
[1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:46.200]  without warrants and they've just got it started and they say the new threat is white conservative
[1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:54.440]  libertarian veteran al Qaeda yeah they're shifting all apparatus over to the host population of the
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:58.680]  countries that's what the war on terror was or is designed to be and that's what's now happening
[1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:04.600]  with all these drones in america you can go and see where they are now and it's all being focused
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:11.960]  back onto the population well again redlink.infowars.com cigarette builder group set to meet in
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:20.120]  virginia may 31st june 3rd maybe we'll dispatch from the uk as the uk correspondent steve i wonder

[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:34.440]  your hotel room and obviously we'll be checking in a few days early at the hotel and so they can
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:40.360]  throw us out i'm surprised i guess they love that shantilly you know why they like it there
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:45.880]  because they just they have all raytheon and all the big defense contractors circle it and it's just
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:51.560]  total surveillance grid and of course this year when i get followed you know we start chasing the
[1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:57.480]  cars that are following us we slam on our brakes get behind them that the um the plane closed state
[1:46:57.480 --> 1:47:02.200]  department marines start flipping us off and they think they're intimidating us then they pull over
[1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:07.800]  we get out they run and lock themselves in bathrooms that's what the that's what happens when you
[1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:12.920]  ask uh peter powers about seven seven and the drill of the exact same target exact same times
[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:18.600]  what three times on tape he goes and locks himself at the bat in the bathroom i mean these
[1:47:18.600 --> 1:47:24.440]  guys are following us who you got shaved heads oh we're so intimidated and and then they'll pull
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:30.680]  over and run into a into a taco shop in one case and lock themselves in the bathroom i mean you
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:35.000]  know we're americans we're journalists we're covering a bunch of crooks coming into our
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  country meeting in secret okay so take some more vaccines breathe some more du go ahead i'm sorry
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:46.440]  no i'm just saying that's what we did in switzerland we started chasing them and
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:56.120]  just looked like petrified little rats it's very different from holding it halfway up a mountain
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:02.280]  in a in a swiss skiing resort isn't it because the the protesters were so close and they actually
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:07.800]  confronted them that now they're gonna obviously they're gonna have the security even tighter but
[1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:12.040]  then they had members of the leg of the state of the federal government of um
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:19.560]  the members of their parliament their congress show up there they had a torch procession with
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:23.800]  the and a lot of them left the day early they see the villagers with torches they left
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:30.440]  oh yeah they would do a flying in and out on helicopters paid for by taxpayers completely
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:36.200]  illegal and they were exposed in that as well so that's only going to be intensified more so this
[1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:43.080]  year in washington i love it these people are maggots
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:48.840]  paul you've done an exemplary job i really appreciate the work you're doing

[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:45.320]  breaking an info wars dot com right now we broke that it was in the
[1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:51.960]  sweatshirt in last year like no it and it's it's it's in spain or it's and we were right we may be
[1:54:51.960 --> 1:54:58.280]  wrong probably not because they've been to that particular conference place twice by the way it's
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:04.440]  got like weird paintings of children that look like they're dead but it's real subtle it's like
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:09.800]  children with like blue skin whose eyes have black circles around them weird creepy paintings everywhere
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:16.760]  and quite frankly i'm going to check in at that hotel but i'm not looking forward to it because
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:20.040]  we check in a few days before to watch all the security people coming in and stuff and they
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:25.800]  harass us and they try to frame us for stuff but if you don't want to do something you got to do it
[1:55:25.800 --> 1:55:33.400]  there's such a thing as walking into a trap fortune favors the bold and it's not that we
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:39.000]  do anything wrong but i mean i'll be at dinner and and and you know feds will just come sit down
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:44.520]  and go let's attack buildings i'm like come on guys you're what are you with the state department
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:49.640]  we could attack the state department and then you know that turns out who they are
[1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:55.560]  and you're just like no you know you know that's not my mo are you guys planning to do that to us
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:55:59.320]  because that's the kind of stuff they do i mean you know kill a million little brown people in
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:06.200]  iraq set up some journalists you're destroying america you're doing a great job but i intend to
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:12.440]  go up there and cover it because we're on the march the empire is on the run it was bilderberg
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:18.520]  in switzerland that turned tail and left and this is my country you may still say it's yours
[1:56:18.520 --> 1:56:25.240]  and you may squat on top dc like a giant bloated wart covered pig sucking off of us but we're going
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:31.400]  to call you out and expose you and the horror media you own won't report on it fine we've got the
[1:56:31.400 --> 1:56:41.080]  real media we are the media not you and we're committed going back to uh mike and washington
[1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:47.640]  mike you were you were asking me how you can tell the militia is good or not i mean i know buying
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:51.480]  you know coffee with cash makes me the devil instead of wearing blue jeans and having a prepaid
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:56.280]  cell phone but the militia you know i mean i love the constitution i love god i love my country i
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:00.600]  know that hanging out with those dudes as legal and great as it is it sticks my head out a little
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:05.000]  bit i'm not worried about me i'm ready to well here's the problem it is constitutional it's pure
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:12.360]  americana because it is so good it is the most saturated area of feds uh but i mean real militias
[1:57:12.360 --> 1:57:18.600]  are either totally private and are just mutual defense leagues preparation leagues uh or their
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:23.480]  military history leagues things like that there are a lot of military re reenactment groups that
[1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:28.120]  they use as a cover for it and it's not that militias are dirty they just choose to be underground
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:32.680]  but but the point is even in private you're just training with the second amendment as civil defense
[1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:37.800]  so i think militia should just be locally organized there should be an underground militia that's
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:41.640]  just prepared to defend the republic and then there should be an above ground that works with
[1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:47.400]  a sheriff uh and you should get sheriff selected that are patriots and and you should mainly be
[1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:53.560]  given homeless people soup when there's floods responding and and acting as a posse the posse
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:58:01.160]  is the militia the the militia is a general posse that's formed county by county to defend against
[1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:07.960]  invasion okay and so it is america so of course the globalists say it's evil they say everything
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:12.360]  that's good is evil and they've got a lot of sheep believing it you know they they believe
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:18.520]  mother's milk is poison but uh you know aspartame is good you know that they think du's good for them
[1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:25.960]  but you know uh grass fed beef is evil you know i mean they think good is bad and bad is good and so
[1:58:25.960 --> 1:58:32.440]  you know the main thing is uh a lot of times the groups that are out there posing as militias
[1:58:32.440 --> 1:58:38.120]  online quite a few of them are feds trolling for people they can set up that i've been warning

[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:34.920]  you know i see a meme out on the internet now that it's a fairy tale that there's eugenics going
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:40.040]  on but it's a fairy tale that cancer rates are way up and neurological disorders
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:49.640]  and uh they're trying to take hatred of israel and then connect it to me
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:55.400]  and say my eugenics thing is trying to cover up for israel what does that even mean
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:01:00.920]  it's like when i made a film about israel attacking the us's liberty to blame it
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:09.000]  on egypt all these big nazi groups and others came out and said i was covering up for israel
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:13.560]  because i pointed out that trader lbj was involved because that's what all the admirals
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:19.880]  i interviewed and and the the first mate and all them said it was like no america wasn't involved
[2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:25.480]  you're now covering up for israel i'm like no no there's two bank robbers i'm not covering up for
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:29.800]  one of them to say and this guy was involved too but but that isn't what matters i just read that
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:35.960]  it's like it's a total pipe dream i mean it's true that i don't hate israel and think about it
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:41.400]  constantly and obsessed with it and worship it from a hateful position uh i understand there's
[2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:48.840]  evil and evil systems in control basically everywhere uh and and and it's just crazy i'm
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:53.320]  covering eugenics and people are like there's no eugenics going on there then you know that's
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:01:59.560]  happening you work for israel and there's just no connection to reality and whereas i don't like a
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:05.000]  lot of things israel's doing i don't like the people that hate israel either i mean can't you
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:10.760]  get that it's like it's like rabid crowds of people who are like in their gang and then they
[2:02:10.760 --> 2:02:17.800]  want you to choose a side in their gang fight and i'm just like hey mutual aggression truce as long
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:24.280]  as you don't do harm to anybody do whatever you want you want to go blow your brains out go ahead
[2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:29.160]  i'm i don't think you should but go ahead it's your right you want to smoke marijuana and sit in
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:34.360]  your mother's basement eating hot pockets all day hey i don't want cops pulling me over asking
[2:02:34.360 --> 2:02:39.160]  to search my car because you want to blast your brain and i know it's got all the great medical
[2:02:39.160 --> 2:02:43.160]  uses and stuff but i do know a lot of potheds on top of it it does have its downside my point is
[2:02:44.680 --> 2:02:52.840]  that i i want freedom i want team humanity to succeed and the globalist the social controllers
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:59.080]  the crony capitalist use this tribalism this divide and conquer to get us fighting with each other
[2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:06.680]  that's why nbc and msnbc edited the zimmerman tapes and the trayvon martin case to make us
[2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:12.440]  on keys of races that's why they have the feds now admitted the justice department inside the
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:17.080]  protest groups including the new black panther party saying i want florida burning start killing
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:21.320]  whitey and now all over the country i read the articles earlier white people are just for no

[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:44.040]  not two but three new factories to china the 20 plus billion bailout to general motors paid to
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:51.560]  ship it to brazil paid to ship it to china paid to ship it to eastern europe and another
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:57.240]  expansion of facilities so it's actually more than three fact four factories with your money
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:05.560]  20 plus billion of it you paid to have the government take over general motors and ship it
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:10.760]  to china if general motors wants to move to china that's great there shouldn't be tax incentives
[2:04:10.760 --> 2:04:15.080]  it should be a level playing field see that's what globalism is in 21 new world order is
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:20.440]  that's why this book by rosa quarry available at info wars dot com is so important behind the

[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:23.880]  from denying it exists to admitting that they basically are going to pick mit romney's vice
[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:29.640]  president they said that last week they said oh he's going to billeburg steering meeting uh down

[2:09:44.040 --> 2:09:50.040]  then i want to get into all the crazy bills where the irs outside of a jury or court says you can't
[2:09:50.040 --> 2:09:55.000]  travel right out of soviet russia right out of stalinism we've got the announcements of drones
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:00.520]  satellites watching us carbon taxes forbes magazine writers has burned down people's houses
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:05.640]  and they don't agree to uh carbon taxes i feel like a liar when i say that it's so over the top
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:12.520]  but he said it i mean these people you know lou i think the authoritarians know the worm is turning
[2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:16.280]  and they're starting to act like chickens with their heads cut off what do you think about all this
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:22.440]  well they're the worm we're we're not the worm but sure i think people are are beginning to
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:29.080]  wake up uh i think uh right after nine eleven i must say i was concerned that uh you know we were
[2:10:29.080 --> 2:10:33.800]  going to get much more of a totalitarian state i was right in that but i was concerned that
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:37.960]  people wouldn't really be resisting it but i think there is more and more resistance
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:41.480]  especially among the young we see it in the romp all campaign when he gets
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:47.240]  eight thousand students coming out to talk to him at uh at ucla kids hanging in trees
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:51.640]  climbing up in trees and staying there for hours just to just to watch him we can tell there's an
[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:56.760]  intellectual revolution going on among the young and of course among those of us who are not young
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:03.480]  as well um there's i think more and more knowledge of what's happening more and more anger at what's
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:08.280]  going on more and more worry and more and more determination to do something about it and this
[2:11:08.280 --> 2:11:13.240]  is the key if people will withdraw their consent from the government from the establishment from
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:19.800]  the whole regime and uh not play ball then they can't actually do it they can't actually work
[2:11:19.800 --> 2:11:25.320]  their uh dastardly deeds against us well you're right we're trotting on their tyranny now they're
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:30.600]  trying to break our will and so they're trying to lash out their worm is turning to go back to
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:37.080]  the old shakespeare quote uh what do you make of them trying to set up internal checkpoints
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:42.360]  and saying the irs will take your passport away the passport is the proof of the citizenship
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:47.000]  the supreme court has rolled over and over again you cannot revoke citizenship it must be freely
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:52.840]  given up well i just might i might just mention if we go back in in history passport is a relatively
[2:11:52.840 --> 2:11:59.000]  recent thing you know there was a time before before uh the turn of the last century when mostly
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.680]  you could travel wherever you wanted to travel you didn't have to have documents you didn't have to
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:08.120]  get the permission of the of the various governments or police if uh even in one of the most interesting
[2:12:08.120 --> 2:12:13.160]  things john maynard canes wrote and one of the few things that was not a bunch of lies he he looked
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:18.920]  back before world war one and he said what a different uh world this was that if a business
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:24.120]  person in london wanted to go set up a business in paris he just took the train and went over
[2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:29.960]  there and was able to rent a place and start his business and uh the currency was sound it was a
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:35.880]  gold standard and they talked about just how much it's funny i guess even even canes had a conscience
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:41.800]  and he talked about how things were so much better in those days so the passport was invented as a
[2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:48.360]  means of the government to control us to control our travel uh it's it's uh um now of course they're
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:53.800]  putting chips in it as we know and they're they're making it much more of a of an i have a they want
[2:12:53.800 --> 2:12:58.520]  to have an internal passport too whether it'll be the current passport or something else they do
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:05.560]  indeed want to control our travel as you mentioned um barba boxer has a bill that is suggested by the
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:11.320]  irs of course these congress people even the evil ones like boxer are mostly just puppets and so she
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:17.320]  was asked by the treasury department to introduce this bill where if they decide that uh you owe
[2:13:17.320 --> 2:13:23.160]  the money uh they can stop you from leaving the united states you have no right to travel uh maybe
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:28.360]  they'll put you in your house and have a have a uh uh you know device around your ankle to
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:33.320]  keep control of us all too it's always important i think when we're thinking about any of these
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:37.640]  things these horrible things that are going on these days as well as the good things that every
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:43.640]  government would like to be a totalitarian state they that that's always their ambition that's the
[2:13:43.640 --> 2:13:47.800]  ambition of the people going to government and it's the ambition of the big the private interests
[2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:52.200]  that are connected to government and benefit from government they would all like total control
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:58.520]  over those of it over the peons over the mundanes over the the uh the poor slobs as they think of us
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:04.760]  who go and work every day and are the actual producers in the country so uh it's what is it
[2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:10.040]  then that keeps every government from being totalitarian what is it that prevents things like
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:15.240]  what's happened since 9 11 in this country from taking place it's popular resistance so when you
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:21.480]  have something like 9 11 that um so drastically diminished popular resistance to government
[2:14:21.480 --> 2:14:27.240]  government spying government uh intrusions and controls of every sort then the government just
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:33.160]  immediately expands and we know they're expanding in these tremendous ways uh we have a pulker
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:36.840]  roberts pointed out the day and uh and they're pointing out that really china has many ways
[2:14:36.840 --> 2:14:41.880]  freer than the united states that that you know at least in china there's no you don't have the
[2:14:41.880 --> 2:14:46.600]  prime minister saying by the way nobody in china has any rights that we can kill you we can jail
[2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:51.880]  you we can torture you if we decide you're a bad guy even that they don't say that only the u.s.
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:57.480]  says that kind of thing and of course carries it out but again i think there's optimism uh
[2:14:58.200 --> 2:15:02.840]  abroad because of young people and because of just what we see is the we can call it the
[2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:07.400]  ron paul movement although it's actually as ron paul points out broader than himself of course
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:14.680]  it's it's a libertarian movement it's it's a uh a tremendous uh reaction to all the horrendous
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:19.080]  stuff that's going on that doesn't mean we've got an easy path ahead things are going to be very
[2:15:19.080 --> 2:15:23.960]  very difficult much more difficult economically uh obama is of course even worse than bush hard
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:28.920]  to believe anybody could be worse than bush obama is worse than bush and i'm i imagine that romney
[2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:34.680]  will if he's elected will be worse than obama uh if obama is reelected he'll be worse than obama
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:40.920]  the first time so uh you know i'd say we can't look to government as our salvation nothing
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:47.720]  good ever comes out of washington dc uh it's really a carbuncle on the uh on the american body
[2:15:47.720 --> 2:15:53.560]  body politic and so we can't look to them we have to look to ourselves look to our neighbors
[2:15:53.560 --> 2:15:58.760]  we have to make the preparations for troubles ahead personal preparations financial preparations
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:05.320]  also ideological and educational preparations we have to read we have to read books we have to
[2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:10.200]  read the right kind of things on the internet we have to educate ourselves to understand what the
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:15.160]  heck is happening we need to know some economics we need to know some real history we need to know
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:19.800]  actual political science we need to know the nature of the state uh which is as mary rothbard
[2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:25.240]  said a gang of thieves writ large you think of government as a gang of thieves writ large it
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:29.560]  really explains everything and you won't be surprised at what they're trying to do and you
[2:16:29.560 --> 2:16:34.600]  know that the one thing we can do as they're trying to steal everything from us our liberty our money
[2:16:34.600 --> 2:16:40.120]  our lives our children our homes our businesses our communities that we have to resist them
[2:16:40.120 --> 2:16:44.600]  and the first step to resisting them is to know who they are what they are why they're doing what
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:51.000]  they're doing and uh why we should oppose it in fact i want to inject a point on the subject
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:58.920]  that you raise the foundation of what is the state and they those that support big government
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:04.360]  and the monopolies that it creates have created through the control corporate media back when
[2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:11.480]  it's a lead dominance this idea that to not trust the state is unamerican that to not blindly believe
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:22.120]  known certified liars uh is is is somehow insane and that you're a conspiracy theorist if you don't
[2:17:22.120 --> 2:17:27.400]  buy into whatever the system is shoveling at you but if you go back to the founding fathers
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:32.600]  and common sense if you go back thousands of years ago in every culture the population knew
[2:17:32.600 --> 2:17:38.760]  there was a corrupt elite ruling over them and the corrupt elite was in castles with armed forces
[2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:45.480]  basically keeping them in servitude but in comes in the 20th century and now 21st more
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:50.840]  sophisticated propaganda and they create this idea that the state loves you and wants to take
[2:17:50.840 --> 2:17:55.320]  care of you and that it's weird to not out of hand just trust him but take George Washington
[2:17:55.320 --> 2:18:01.720]  he was the first person who ever had executive power like that in in in more modern history
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:07.720]  who did not become king they wanted him to and when he left after two terms and went back to
[2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:12.840]  be a farmer because that's what he really enjoyed uh you know the king of england said today george
[2:18:12.840 --> 2:18:18.600]  washington's the greatest man in the world and it was because no one would give up that type of power
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:25.320]  and so that that original americana idea is so precious and the system claims it's alien and
[2:18:25.320 --> 2:18:31.240]  radical the truth is the system is what is alien and radical i want you to comment on that well
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:35.720]  there was an interesting column in the washington post recently where was moaning and groaning
[2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:42.440]  about the horrible social secret service scandal and the gsa scandal these are so horrible they
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:46.600]  would undermine people's trust in the government well of course people should have no trust in
[2:18:46.600 --> 2:18:51.800]  the government or rather you can trust the government to always do the evil thing i mean
[2:18:51.800 --> 2:18:56.200]  they if they can get away with it if they don't do the evil thing it's because they either haven't
[2:18:56.200 --> 2:19:02.200]  thought of it or they don't think it's in their own interests or they can't get it together to do
[2:19:02.200 --> 2:19:07.800]  it because of course government is the most incompetent agency ever to exist anybody who's
[2:19:07.800 --> 2:19:12.200]  ever been in the military or worked for the the civilian part of the federal government
[2:19:12.200 --> 2:19:16.600]  and is willing to tell the truth uh we'll tell you that they've never seen anything like this i mean
[2:19:16.600 --> 2:19:23.560]  it's just the waste the corruption uh the nastiness the controls and this is what of course they want
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:28.520]  they want the whole they want all of america to be like an airport we're all weighed patiently in
[2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:31.960]  line we're afraid to look them in the eye or maybe we're supposed to look them in the eye or
[2:19:31.960 --> 2:19:36.360]  otherwise you're a terrorist and the blue shirts are uh can do whatever they want to you to you
[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:42.920]  your children your parents uh you just have to go along let them x-ray you let them uh question you
[2:19:42.920 --> 2:19:46.760]  you have no rights and they've got total control so that's what that's you know that's what they
[2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:51.000]  it's off the chart when we come back i'm gonna i'm gonna ask you i don't know yet what's number

[2:24:36.200 --> 2:24:42.520]  is a real expert on that and the fact that ron paul has already won as he wrote a few months ago
[2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:47.960]  in a piece i also want to read a quote out of light and liberty reflections on the pursuit
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:53.560]  of happiness thomas jefferson this book by thomas jefferson re-edited and released
[2:24:54.200 --> 2:24:57.880]  a guy came to my house and put this on my doorstep once my wife got pretty mad but it was a good
[2:24:57.880 --> 2:25:03.240]  book well she had a 357 and told he got to leave he was knocking on our door at 10 o'clock at night
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:07.560]  trying to give me this but i didn't know how close he came but not a good idea to come to my house
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:13.640]  side issue uh let's go back to lou rockwell lou grab bag of everything going on right now what's
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:18.760]  front and center on your radar screen well it's you know so much bad that's happening but i i do
[2:25:18.760 --> 2:25:24.440]  notice ron paul just wrote about this in fact that there's a new remember the sopa bill so pa
[2:25:24.440 --> 2:25:29.880]  that was designed to take control of the internet in the name of so-called intellectual property
[2:25:29.880 --> 2:25:35.480]  that bill was defeated thank goodness now there's another one even a worse one called syspa cis pa
[2:25:35.480 --> 2:25:45.480]  and these bills are both designed by the recording industry and the movie industry to uh and by the
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:51.800]  nsa and the fbi and the cia and all to work together to crush the internet and to make sure
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:57.800]  that the movie industry and the recording industry can get what i would argue are unjust unjust
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:04.280]  profits uh through the government so it's it's in the name of stopping you know quote unquote theft
[2:26:04.280 --> 2:26:08.920]  on the internet that they want to take total control they are before our eyes of course
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:14.760]  they are doing doing more that make us pay for it get rid of due process instead of them going
[2:26:14.760 --> 2:26:20.120]  out and forcing their so-called copyrights yeah i mean it's uh you know i would argue that both
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:24.600]  copyrights and patents are illegitimate grants of government monopoly but the way that it was in
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:29.240]  the constitution everything was standable but starting under the reagan administration this
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:34.760]  was stepped up to such a horrendous uh extent one of the excuses was to keep mickey maus and
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:40.920]  copyright uh by the disney company um and ronald reagan was always sort of a the agent of the
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:47.160]  hollywood mafia among his other roles in life and so he would you know rolled over for them and and
[2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:52.520]  these things were put in it keeps getting worse and worse they keep extending their copyrights and
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:58.760]  um they're trying to say now you can't show a newspaper on tv the lawyers are and of course
[2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:03.240]  it's all made up i a lady called earlier and said the police are telling him you're not allowed to
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:07.880]  defend yourself in your home anymore because of the zimmerman case and that you've got to call
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:14.120]  i mean because a cop said so that's just the way it is we have the in the tsa invading flea markets
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:18.920]  looking for you know allegedly counterfeit shirts that somebody's producing a shirt that might look
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:24.600]  like uh allegedly like uh you know a gucci shirt or uh some expensive shirt they were making an
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:30.040]  inexpensive shirt no judge no jury they just saw just go in seize the property put them in jail
[2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:36.760]  so it's all in a horrendous tyranny and this is right across the the world the u.s. government
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:44.760]  uses this as a uh as a control they're trying to extradite them right now a a boy from england uh
[2:27:44.760 --> 2:27:54.680]  who has uh asperger syndrome and as a teenager um put up a website that had on it links to um bit
[2:27:54.680 --> 2:27:59.240]  torrent sites and other sites where you could download movies so just the fact that he had a
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:03.960]  site which is not illegal in england by the way that had links to other sites the u.s. government
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:09.560]  wants to take this kid bring it back to this country and put him in jail for 12 years 12 years
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:13.400]  and this is another thing going on in this country of course the growth of the prison industrial
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:20.840]  complex uh there was recently a black lady a homeless lady who had enrolled her her child
[2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:26.120]  in a better school district than when she lived in uh they're putting her in jail again for 12 years
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:32.440]  12 years i mean so the one thing we need to we always need to keep in mind is the people who
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:38.520]  work in the government have what st. augustin called the libido dominante the lust to dominate
[2:28:38.520 --> 2:28:43.640]  the lust to rule they like to take us and do this they this is their this is going to get a charge
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:49.080]  out of this they love this so not only is the prison industrial complex uh make a lot of profits
[2:28:49.080 --> 2:28:53.320]  for people a lot of these profits prisons are profitable and of course the government prisons
[2:28:53.320 --> 2:28:57.880]  are built by private industry and so forth so there's always that thing but people who work
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:03.400]  in the government love putting people in jail they love starting wars they like killing people
[2:29:03.400 --> 2:29:08.600]  they like torture they're not good people we don't want them running our lives well that's right i mean
[2:29:08.600 --> 2:29:14.120]  who wants a job at the tsa grabbing women and children's genitals i mean and and it's coming
[2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:21.400]  out that they enjoy it and like it and tell people so well when ron paul was um had his first experience
[2:29:21.400 --> 2:29:27.000]  with this and it was horrendous he has titanium knees so they he has to when he goes to the commercial

[2:33:33.960 --> 2:33:41.800]  to a group that are all anti free market the big fortune 100 sitting on top government sucking
[2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:47.480]  through government off the population and corporate welfare and trying to make the general public
[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:54.600]  dependent and jp morgan administering the welfare cards and the food stamps and it is a nightmare
[2:33:54.600 --> 2:33:58.920]  and and and lou i want you to finish your ron paul story but then i want to just get this question
[2:33:58.920 --> 2:34:05.560]  out now i'll do it after but sure people are waking up but that's people that can tie their
[2:34:05.560 --> 2:34:13.640]  shoelaces one layer the other half the population is on the government mammary gland yeah and of
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:17.880]  course this is you know this is a read up to the ron paul story i'll say a little bit more about
[2:34:17.880 --> 2:34:23.000]  that but i'll just finish that this is the first time he had to go through the full tsa treatment
[2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:28.520]  he has titanium knees therefore even if he wanted to go through the x where he can't they won't let
[2:34:28.520 --> 2:34:37.320]  him and he got them you know extremely intrusive and horrendous examination by the tsa and ron
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:43.240]  said to the man he said how can you how can you stand to do a job like this and the man looked at
[2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:49.400]  him in the eye and said i love doing it so yeah they do of course these are not i mean they must
[2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:54.680]  maybe i'm sure there are some decent people out of the 40 or 50 000 tsa blue shirts who are
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:59.400]  caught up in this they didn't have a job they needed something but really really the kinds
[2:34:59.400 --> 2:35:03.720]  of people get hired by the government if they're decent people it's a mistake it's a mistake
[2:35:03.720 --> 2:35:07.560]  they're in there they don't want decent people in the government they want people again who were
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:13.240]  willing to do this to you that's that's that that's their philosophy listen when like top movie stars
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:19.000]  in lax now it turns out stalkers are battling and doing anything they can to become tsa because
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:24.600]  it's hollywood stars all day coming through and they go crazy and it's like a celebration it's on
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:30.840]  video and photos and they just grope them and grab them and miss usa they go in her pants in dallas
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:37.240]  because they knew who she was and actually in her body and listen i was with jessie ventura they i have
[2:35:37.240 --> 2:35:42.280]  flown out of vegas where i was doing a video shoot with ventura and the guy knew who i was and said i
[2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:47.960]  have quote louie actually said this i have an administrative privilege he said by the way i
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:52.280]  heard your show yesterday from here in vegas and all this and was rubbing on me and getting off on
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:59.400]  the power of it clearly getting off on it and when i flew with ventura out of uh Atlanta they all knew
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:06.200]  who he was we're talking to him and we're taking their time squeezing his genitals and i couldn't
[2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:10.280]  believe it i sort of taking photos and ventura was embarrassed and said stop and he made me erase
[2:36:10.280 --> 2:36:15.160]  him and he later sued him of course and it got thrown out and they actually went i don't i don't
[2:36:15.160 --> 2:36:24.120]  want to go over it the point is exactly they told ron paul i love it they love it they look how many
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:30.840]  are getting busted so go ahead no of course they love it these are the kinds of people who who go
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:35.480]  into the government tend to go into the government not every postman is a bad guy but the people who
[2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:39.720]  tend to go into the government are like this and certainly the people who rise in the government
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:45.720]  if a hayek wrote a great chapter in his book the road to serfdom on why the worst rise to the top
[2:36:45.720 --> 2:36:52.120]  in government unlike in in a private business and uh uh in private life the worst do not tend to
[2:36:52.120 --> 2:36:57.000]  rise to the top but in government the worst people the worst the worst liars the worst power
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:04.200]  mongers the worst war mongers the worst people who are just love all that's evil they are the ones
[2:37:04.200 --> 2:37:09.000]  that with the demagogues they're the ones who rise to the top and get and and become you know
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  president of the united states for example these are not the good guys these are the worst people
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:18.440]  in society and he looked at ron paul yeah he told that story here on air made the drudge report
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:26.120]  he he looked at him and said i love this job indeed well he said no he said i i love it
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:31.800]  ron ron said to him how can you how can you stand doing a job like this and he looked him in the
[2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:37.080]  eye and he said i love it i love it oh yeah there that he took at least he told the truth for that
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:41.560]  moment my guess is he wouldn't tell the truth in public but uh he told the truth with a great
[2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:46.200]  animus too of course these people they also hate us by the way as you put as you point out they
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:50.920]  talk about they're going to care for us as always they're helping the poor they're helping the elderly
[2:37:50.920 --> 2:37:55.720]  they're helping the sick and so forth uh you know they they of course are hurting all these groups
[2:37:56.760 --> 2:38:03.160]  and we can just see you know if we think of the government has passed so many laws very intrusive
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:09.320]  laws in the name of helping the disabled or in preventing assaults on children so where so when
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:14.600]  the government you know is in control of course we see how they treat the disabled in the airports
[2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:19.160]  we see how they treat children in the airports again you can't believe a word they say or rather
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:23.480]  you can typically believe the opposite of what they say so that's uh that's the rule of thumb
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:30.520]  well it's not typically look at the tsa they lie on every subject and get caught and keep lying
[2:38:31.160 --> 2:38:35.960]  and i just can't believe the american people turn their children over to them so that's my next
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:42.520]  question what do you do about half the population that can't survive without a government paycheck
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:47.960]  and who believe it's there it's like that woman who had like nine kids and was getting like all
[2:38:47.960 --> 2:38:53.880]  these dozens of welfare checks and she said i deserve more what are you going to do for me
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:59.560]  well you know we have one of the things that democracy does hunts herman hapa has a great
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:04.200]  book on this democracy the god that failed one of the democracy has been a great invention for
[2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:09.400]  government from a practical standpoint we end up with it you know socialist a or socialist b we
[2:39:09.400 --> 2:39:15.000]  can vote for so they don't they don't worry about who wins the election uh but from a from a ideological
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:19.560]  standpoint they convince people that you know we are the government you hear americans saying
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:25.720]  should we go to mars should we invade syria you know it's not we doing this it's this separate
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:31.480]  and it is parasitical entity that's called the government and the military complex and so forth
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:37.080]  so um democracy has you talked about earlier how in earlier times people saw the government as the
[2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:41.720]  rich people living in the castle and collecting taxes from them and they correctly saw the government
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:47.240]  as something separate from them democracy makes us believe entirely erroneously that we are the
[2:39:47.240 --> 2:39:54.200]  government and it it it uh um blurs that distinction about who is and as john c calhoun said who's the
[2:39:54.200 --> 2:39:59.240]  the taxpayer and who's the tax eater so yeah there are a lot of people who're getting government
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:04.040]  checks the government is still a minority though they can't they can't if they were the majority
[2:40:04.040 --> 2:40:07.880]  uh they would the whole thing would collapse they have to be a small minority that is those who
[2:40:07.880 --> 2:40:13.400]  are entirely living off the government but by making a lot of other people a little bit living off
[2:40:13.400 --> 2:40:17.800]  the government they make them they hope to gain their loyalty and i'm sorry to say they do gain
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:22.360]  their loyalty so people are worried about oh gosh social security is going to go broke or medicare
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:27.000]  is going to go broke uh although those things can't go broke anymore than the pentagon can go broke
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:31.400]  as long as they got the printing press they'll keep everything everything in existence uh because
[2:40:31.400 --> 2:40:36.680]  that the dollar can be worthless but the all these things will will be in existence because
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:41.640]  they exist for purposes of control they don't exist to help people they exist to make people
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:46.360]  subservient to the government dependent on the government mentally dependent on the government
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:52.200]  and never to threaten everything uh everything always to go along uh bathe them believe they're
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:55.560]  baloney whether it's taught in the public schools i mean i asked myself why do people
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:41:00.120]  send their kids to the public schools why would anybody do that some people are forced into it
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:04.520]  financially but a lot of people could easily afford send their children to a decent private
[2:41:04.520 --> 2:41:10.280]  school or to do homeschooling uh they won't do it because they think well this is well i do but
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:17.160]  here's the problem then even good quote christian schools or others want to be accredited so your
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:21.240]  child can quote get the credits to go to college or whatever which is now what more than half of
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:25.480]  college graduates will never even be able to get a job that pays for half of their debt it it is a
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:31.720]  fraud because they ship the jobs out of the country by design but through crony deals and monopoly
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:38.840]  deals but now they are you know giving them stuff about how great barack obama's wife is and you
[2:41:38.840 --> 2:41:43.640]  know what you're supposed to eat under no child left behind even in the private schools that they're
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:47.960]  taking everything over well of course they do want to take over the private school a lot of
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:51.560]  these private schools and you have to be careful a lot of them are what a friend of mine calls
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:56.360]  public schools with tuition so yeah you are you are so i but why homeschooling is really the only
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:02.840]  probably the only thing that can uh where you can entirely be in control of what your children
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:06.200]  are being taught but there are good private schools still there are private schools that
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:10.200]  fight this sort of thing that don't just use the government curriculum but you're right about
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:15.640]  accreditation i mean accreditation as a government scheme as a government control scheme uh as to
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:20.440]  college yeah more and more people as you say are looking into whether uh you know james alcher
[2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:25.080]  points out even the even the what we think of as less expensive colleges it's about a two hundred
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:29.240]  thousand dollar expenditure because you have to take into account the money you're not earning
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:35.400]  during the years you're in college so um it's it's very expensive these kids end up with huge
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:41.800]  amounts of debt uh the government aid government takeover the education system has made impossible
[2:42:41.800 --> 2:42:46.440]  what ron paul for example did when he was in college he worked his way through school now that's a
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:52.120]  science fiction uh uh idea these days nobody can work their way through school because the prices
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:58.600]  have driven so unbelievably high by the government benefiting the faculty benefiting the administration
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:02.760]  benefiting the groups that are connected to them and sticking it to the student
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:07.800]  same thing with medical care doctors do great hospitals do great big pharma do great does great
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:12.840]  patients get hurt so this is again the way the government does these things all these welfare
[2:43:12.840 --> 2:43:18.840]  schemes uh are actually evil they've not and they're not does it's not all it's not uh
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:22.840]  just that they don't turn out the way the government hope they turned out the government's
[2:43:22.840 --> 2:43:31.080]  motives are always wrong they're always evil they always seek control destruction taxes wars all
[2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:36.520]  the stuff they let me stop you let me stop you look at history that sounds horrible to an individual
[2:43:36.520 --> 2:43:40.440]  person why would they do that individuals always think of well why would they want to
[2:43:40.440 --> 2:43:46.040]  have a false flag to take your rights to be the hero uh people always think of things from their
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:51.720]  individual perspective and your point of how they're like we're gonna attack iran no we're not
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:57.480]  the foreign megabanks that run our criminal government are the ones doing that um we're not
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:02.440]  putting fluoride in our water uh big chemical companies are paying government to put a toxic
[2:44:02.440 --> 2:44:07.240]  waste in your water and making you pay for it but when you read this book behind the green mask
[2:44:07.240 --> 2:44:11.800]  it's in 21 by rosa quora that by the way is available at info wars dot com it's all the quotes
[2:44:11.800 --> 2:44:17.480]  it's all the plans it's morey strong they want to post industrial society where no one is allowed
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:23.480]  to operate but them and that raises my next point where do you see this battle going because
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:28.920]  you know head guy a scientist james lovelock has come out reversed himself admitted that it's all
[2:44:28.920 --> 2:44:35.960]  a big hoax man make global warming but that they needed it to basically be able to sell the public
[2:44:35.960 --> 2:44:40.360]  on other things that are good for the environment meanwhile government and social estates always
[2:44:40.360 --> 2:44:44.760]  are the worst take the soviet union now we have as i mentioned the start of the interview forbes
[2:44:44.760 --> 2:44:49.640]  coming out and saying um uh one of their writers let's burn down people's houses let's mark down
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:54.920]  where they live let's go get them and then that's allowed we have the justice department
[2:44:55.800 --> 2:45:01.720]  inside the protest for trevon martin trying to get a riot going confirmed that's been uh leaked
[2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:07.640]  i mean my point is people shouldn't underestimate how authoritarian they are so looking forward
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:13.000]  from history because not just the way things are i want what we're where lou rockwell thinks
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:19.400]  things are going because the authoritarians now every day i see it are calling for violence
[2:45:19.880 --> 2:45:27.320]  are calling uh for dictatorial takeover they know we're waking up so now they're settling the idea
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:32.360]  within their ranks of let's just start arresting people for their speech uh there's going to be a
[2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:38.120]  big dealie plaza protest with 50th anniversary they've announced no protest allowed they're leasing
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:45.320]  to the schoolbook building a museum the entire area for two days for 110 dollars leasing a park
[2:45:45.960 --> 2:45:49.800]  and and they're saying no one allowed there but their people because they know media is going to
[2:45:49.800 --> 2:45:55.560]  be there i mean this is just off the charts well if we think back to what the ancient romans had
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:46:02.280]  as one of their slogans for the for their empire a devided emperor divide and rule divide and conquer
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:07.560]  governments always want to get people fighting against each other i mean whether we look at
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:13.160]  say what you know the u.s. did in in in iraq they broke it up i mean so they caused tremendous
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:16.920]  tensions between the sunnis and the shiites and the curds and so forth this is what they
[2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:21.000]  want to do in syria they're doing it in syria this is what they want to do in iran this is what
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:25.400]  they're doing in our own country so in order to keep people from focusing on their real enemy
[2:46:25.400 --> 2:46:31.160]  which of course is not al-qaeda whatever it's washington dc they want us they want to you know
[2:46:31.160 --> 2:46:36.680]  split us up so of course they promote race war they promote all kinds of horrible things that we
[2:46:36.680 --> 2:46:41.080]  should you know liberal should hate conservatives and all the rest they want that's what they want
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:45.400]  you focusing on that and never to discuss the government you'll notice if we look listen to
[2:46:45.400 --> 2:46:50.600]  the say the neocon you know rush limbaugh or shan hanity or they never discuss the nature of the
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:55.480]  government we're always supposed to focus on all the evil of flag burning or whatever so they
[2:46:55.480 --> 2:47:01.080]  always want you on some other thing that doesn't threaten the government but that divides the people
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:06.600]  so they will not become united you don't have to be united diversity is wonderful of all sorts
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:12.840]  you don't have to be united in any sense except against the enemy where's the enemy the enemy
[2:47:12.840 --> 2:47:19.400]  is in washington dc well so where do you see things going though i mean if you look into a crystal
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:24.040]  ball where do you see america in five ten years well you know first of all you have to be worried
[2:47:24.040 --> 2:47:27.160]  about things like the department that you've talked about about the department of homeland
[2:47:27.160 --> 2:47:34.520]  security buying 450 million rounds of a hollow point 40 caliber ammunition what what are they
[2:47:34.520 --> 2:47:39.560]  doing that's enough to wage a war what what do they plan to do with that uh is it because they
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:45.800]  want to seize our guns and they're buying armored mobile pill boxes for the highways and tsa is
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:51.720]  now nationwide doing gropes and bag searches on street corners and buses i mean totally illegal
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:56.120]  that's right and we've have you know some of the tsa people who said that there should be these
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:48:02.600]  booths at malls uh and at public libraries and in all public schools you should have to you
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:07.640]  should have to be groped to go into you know into anything they decide uh where you know the some
[2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:14.120]  phantom uh terrorist from overseas might be coming when they get the actual terrorists people spy on
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:20.520]  us take our money run our lives try to hurt us are in there are in our own government i'll put
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:26.120]  that in quotes um so where do i see things headed i think there's a battle i mean on the other hand
[2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:31.160]  there has always been a battle between between freedom and state this has always existed in as
[2:48:31.160 --> 2:48:36.440]  long as there's been civilized humanity sometimes the bad guys win and we end up with an egyptian
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:41.720]  system where the god where the god is actually the government and you have to bow down and you
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:46.600]  know be a slave be the slave of the pharaoh on the other hand sometimes we have massive increases
[2:48:46.600 --> 2:48:51.880]  and in liberty it happened in the ancient world it's happened in america and and and other places
[2:48:51.880 --> 2:48:56.840]  now where you know it seems like we're in retreat uh but the battle is i think never is going to be
[2:48:56.840 --> 2:49:02.920]  over uh until the end of the world there's always going to be this struggle so um i think the
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:07.800]  struggle will continue i think we're going to be i would say 10 years from now we will be far
[2:49:07.800 --> 2:49:13.560]  better off than we are today not that we won't have immense troubles we have a lot of economic
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:18.600]  troubles to go through who knows what the federal reserve is going to do to us even who knows what
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:24.520]  the federal reserve has already done to us so we have all the but the thing is government is subject
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:30.280]  to the laws of reality they all think in government that all they have to do use their one tool the
[2:49:30.280 --> 2:49:35.000]  gun put it to your head and say do it but we're going to put you in jail we're going to kill you
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:39.720]  this by the way is what's on the traffic ticket if you don't pay your library fine or anything else
[2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:45.080]  this is the one way the government has to operate but the gun can't actually gun for example is not
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:50.200]  exactly a creative force when it's used when it's used by a private criminal or government criminals
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:54.760]  and they there are a lot of things they cannot actually bring about so i think the fact that
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:50:00.440]  kids are what ron paul you know as i mentioned ron paul has actually already won because of the
[2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:05.800]  millions of minds he's changed not only in this country hearts he's touched not only in this country
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:12.600]  in latin america and asia in europe kids love ron paul all over this there's finally an alternative
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:16.600]  to the status left and status right when we come back i want to jam in a caller to
[2:50:16.600 --> 2:50:21.640]  blue but i also want to bring this up to you they have publicly now announced the war on
[2:50:21.640 --> 2:50:28.120]  terror is over but the tsa of the checkpoints are intensifying and they say now it's now for domestic
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:33.640]  groups and libertarians and people they actually and returning veterans so they're now admitting
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:38.040]  what we warned they're saying don't worry about al-qaeda they work for us in libya they're good
[2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:45.800]  now the enemy is you i mean that's amazing i want to ask you why are they hiding everything in plain
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:50.040]  view now i guess because they know we've been exposing them or they just gotten delusional
[2:50:50.040 --> 2:50:54.440]  we'll get lou rockwell's take on that straight ahead lou rockwell dot com i'm alex jones of info

[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:24.680]  answer as he went to break and now i can't even remember it because during the break curtain
[2:54:24.680 --> 2:54:32.440]  demo said have you seen my new article and info wars dot com and i started reading it and i'd seen
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:37.080]  this call by the white house this is this is racketeering this is discrimination like black
[2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:40.760]  people come and try to buy your house they've got the credit you say i don't sell to black people
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:46.200]  but see when government corporations do it it's supposedly okay bank of america's war on the
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:54.200]  second amendment they're now telling a major ceo of a major gun company they will not let them
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:54:59.400]  do business with them have bank accounts loans whatever bankster giant bank of america has
[2:54:59.400 --> 2:55:03.720]  joined the effort to take down the second amendment and deny americans the right to own and use firearms
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:10.280]  kelly mcmillan the ceo of mcmillan fiberglass stocks mcmillan group international mcmillan
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:14.680]  firearms manufacturer recently wrote on his facebook page the bank of america has refused to do
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:18.680]  business with his companies because they sell firearms and we're seeing where they won't
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:23.080]  take ads and newspapers forum bank of america admitted its decision was political
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:27.320]  his response was to immediately stop doing business bank of america
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.480]  and uh because they're saying that they won't do business with him
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:38.840]  and it goes over at all i mean this is just the so authoritarian lou what was my questions
[2:55:38.840 --> 2:55:44.680]  we went to break do you remember uh well you wanted to talk about what's ahead i i frankly
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:49.800]  i don't remember exactly what you're at no no i mean i got blindsided by this what do you make
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:57.240]  of of just of all the all the authoritarian stuff they're doing it's not stopping people buying
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:01.640]  all-time record five million guns a month and saying it's because they don't like the government
[2:56:01.640 --> 2:56:06.600]  i mean they're losing don't they get it and they're bullying isn't scaring people anymore
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:12.120]  well you can't you know something else you can't trust is the the big banks you can't trust the
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:17.640]  big banks uh these are these are institutions that are inherently corrupt uh they engage in
[2:56:17.640 --> 2:56:22.440]  fractional reserve banking meaning that they're fraudulent they are the government they admit
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:26.680]  in europe that they've taken over europe no and they and they cooperate with the federal reserve
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:30.440]  to bring on the business cycle if it weren't for the big banks and the federal reserve
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:34.680]  and banking i must say in general as it exists in this country we wouldn't have recessions
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:39.480]  and depressions so these are these are not good institutions and they treat you of course like
[2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:44.840]  a like a microbe if you're one of their customers and so as you say they're getting rid of they're
[2:56:44.840 --> 2:56:48.360]  getting rid of one of their business customers because they don't like people owning guns well
[2:56:48.360 --> 2:56:52.520]  i'm sure they don't well people ought to get out of bank hope nobody has an account in bank of america
[2:56:52.520 --> 2:56:57.720]  uh get out of bank of america this is bank of america so disconnected banks exactly small bank
[2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:01.000]  it's gonna be much better off dealing with a small community bank you can check the ratings
[2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:05.880]  uh but you're far you know don't deal with these great big banks and also dealing cash to the
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:11.560]  extent you can the government hates cash the banks of course hate cash because if you're dealing
[2:57:11.560 --> 2:57:16.440]  in cash they don't have that money to be able to pyramid loans on top of it and cause all kinds of
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:21.080]  trouble and and to exacerbate the whole inflation process well that's what i was about to say in
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:25.720]  closings we're almost out of time and of course they don't have time for calls is that they try to
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:30.680]  charge five dollars every time you use your own bank card when they're using your money people said
[2:57:30.680 --> 2:57:36.520]  no but this shows how disconnected bank of america goldman sacks jp morgan the shareholders of the
[2:57:36.520 --> 2:57:41.960]  fellow reserve are they think they're god and are trying to shut down real local banks but one
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:48.360]  small thing you can do again is use cash deal and cash they if you try to get a significant
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:52.280]  amount it's it's actually fun to do it to go into your bank and ask for a significant amount of your
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:57.880]  own cash they hate your guts they'll do everything possible that make you feel bad that you're wanting
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:02.920]  your own money and the reason is because it hurts them when you when you get that cash out you deal
[2:58:02.920 --> 2:58:08.120]  in cash so the extent that everybody can deal in cash deal with a small bank you're hitting them
[2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:12.840]  where it hurt hey i've gotten out less than do i've gotten out less than 10 000 and had bank
[2:58:12.840 --> 2:58:18.600]  managers call me and ask me if i'm a criminal just to make me feel bad yeah of course you're
[2:58:18.600 --> 2:58:23.640]  not here you're not you're not a tool of the banksters you must be a bad guy because they're
[2:58:23.640 --> 2:58:29.320]  the bad guys lou rockwell amazing interview ron paul has already won the hearts and minds that is
