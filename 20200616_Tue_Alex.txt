[00:00.000 --> 00:14.640]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:14.640 --> 00:17.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:17.560 --> 00:23.400]  We will be hearing from Alex Jones today, Owen Troyer in studio again for Alex, a very
[00:23.400 --> 00:27.880]  heavy news day today.
[00:27.880 --> 00:35.840]  And I'll be getting to all the news, a lot of videos to get to, and your phone calls
[00:35.840 --> 00:43.360]  before Paul Joseph Watson takes over at two o'clock central.
[00:43.360 --> 00:51.560]  Well ladies and gentlemen, watching everything play out almost to a tee, how Info Wars told
[00:51.560 --> 01:01.400]  you it was going to play out has an interesting taste to it, an interesting feel to it, because
[01:01.400 --> 01:12.200]  you almost feel handicapped, especially when you have been censored and denied your right
[01:12.200 --> 01:26.640]  to free speech when you have been lied about, slandered and libeled nonstop.
[01:26.640 --> 01:36.920]  And so I saw two things today that really summarize the attack on free speech and the
[01:36.920 --> 01:41.400]  internet censorship, and it's not to make it about us here at Info Wars, except it
[01:41.400 --> 01:44.120]  is about us here at Info Wars.
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.840]  We are the test case.
[01:49.840 --> 01:55.120]  And it's summarized in two ways.
[01:55.120 --> 02:05.720]  You have a study that just got released, a randomized trial on Twitter plus academia,
[02:05.720 --> 02:12.160]  112 papers were randomly chosen to be shared on Twitter by a group with around 58,000 followers
[02:12.160 --> 02:14.200]  or not to be shared.
[02:14.200 --> 02:18.440]  Papers that were tweeted accumulated four times more citations compared to non-tweeted
[02:18.440 --> 02:21.840]  papers over one year.
[02:21.840 --> 02:24.840]  And the study is, does tweeting improve citations?
[02:24.840 --> 02:29.080]  One year results from the TSSMN perspective randomized trial.
[02:29.080 --> 02:37.040]  And so the answer is obviously, yes, big league, huge league.
[02:37.040 --> 02:42.320]  It's like saying, hey, if you play your ad during the Super Bowl, will people see it?
[02:42.320 --> 02:53.080]  Yeah, it's just the most watched televised event in America.
[02:53.080 --> 02:59.280]  So when Info Wars was allowed on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook and everything else,
[02:59.280 --> 03:06.920]  we would get, let's not exaggerate, 10 times, 100 times in some cases, the reach.
[03:06.920 --> 03:08.920]  We've been denied that.
[03:08.920 --> 03:09.920]  Why?
[03:09.920 --> 03:20.160]  Well, we don't plan terrorist attacks or violence or felonious activities like desecrating
[03:20.160 --> 03:27.200]  local objects and monuments, no, we just dare come on here and tell you the truth about
[03:27.200 --> 03:35.360]  what's really going on in America without the mainstream media filter, lies, bias, etc.
[03:35.360 --> 03:41.640]  And for that, and supporting Donald Trump, we aren't allowed on the internet.
[03:41.640 --> 03:45.700]  Of course, thanks to your support at infowarestore.com, we still have banned out video, which leads
[03:45.700 --> 03:55.560]  me to my second point, CIA analyst for Fox News, Buck Sexton puts out a whole thread
[03:55.560 --> 04:01.840]  about how conservatives need a platform that won't be censored, won't be curated and will
[04:01.840 --> 04:03.560]  ultimately be free speech.
[04:03.560 --> 04:10.320]  Now, I like Buck Sexton, if that's his real name.
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.160]  I like his commentary on Fox News, but does he really not know about Info Wars?
[04:14.160 --> 04:16.440]  Does he really not know about banned out video?
[04:16.440 --> 04:18.040]  Do these people really not know?
[04:18.040 --> 04:20.960]  Do they really not know what we've built?
[04:20.960 --> 04:26.040]  Do they really not know this is the mothership?
[04:26.040 --> 04:29.760]  Has the censorship been that successful of Info Wars?
[04:29.760 --> 04:33.040]  Has the chilling of free speech been that successful against Americans?
[04:33.040 --> 04:38.080]  Well, I don't know.
[04:38.080 --> 04:42.960]  Maybe it has, maybe it hasn't, but I do know this.
[04:42.960 --> 04:48.840]  Even in these perilous times, folks, in the land of confusion and insanity, Info Wars
[04:48.840 --> 04:52.760]  isn't going anywhere.
[04:52.760 --> 04:57.120]  I think Barack Obama just cried a little bit, just shed a little tear, because we're not
[04:57.120 --> 04:59.640]  all fair yet.
[04:59.640 --> 05:08.240]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 Spray, available now for 33% off
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.160]  at infowarstore.com.
[05:12.160 --> 05:18.960]  Others have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep
[05:18.960 --> 05:21.960]  earth crystal nascent iodine.
[05:21.960 --> 05:29.200]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine

[05:52.960 --> 06:14.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, June 16, 2020.
[06:14.040 --> 06:19.520]  This is the Alex Jones show, Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones, a lot of news coming
[06:19.520 --> 06:25.160]  up, a lot of video clips coming up, and your phone calls, and hopefully we will be hearing
[06:25.160 --> 06:33.960]  live from our team on the ground from Chaz, or now otherwise known as Chop.
[06:33.960 --> 06:42.440]  Who knows, they may change their nation again before the end of this broadcast, where superheroes
[06:42.440 --> 06:46.120]  are running around in capes and masks.
[06:46.120 --> 06:55.640]  Vigilantes are handing out guns to minors, police can't get through, farmers are trying
[06:55.640 --> 07:05.280]  to grow crops on cardboard, whiteboards with a list of demands and requests all over the
[07:05.280 --> 07:15.000]  town, and when a preacher goes in or a Trump supporter goes in, well, they're not welcome.
[07:15.000 --> 07:23.520]  Coming to the Alex Jones show here today, I got a lot of news that I'm going to be covering,
[07:23.520 --> 07:29.080]  and I hate to see what the media has done to this country.
[07:29.080 --> 07:33.600]  It makes my blood boil.
[07:33.600 --> 07:42.200]  I hate to see that the media in this country has pit American against American, has pit
[07:42.200 --> 07:56.520]  human against human, has pit logic and reasoning against lies and disinformation.
[07:56.520 --> 08:07.240]  These things have side effects, and everything we're witnessing in this country right now
[08:07.240 --> 08:14.880]  are the side effects.
[08:14.880 --> 08:23.560]  Now I don't know if President Trump is going to play the ace of spades that he has before
[08:23.560 --> 08:32.680]  election night 2020, and he actually has a litany of ace of spades that he could play.
[08:32.680 --> 08:39.360]  I don't know if he's planning on doing that.
[08:39.360 --> 08:45.840]  I will tell you that he's planning on placating to the lowest common denominator right now
[08:45.840 --> 08:53.160]  of the Republican Party of the conservative movement, and they are fully buying it.
[08:53.160 --> 08:56.520]  Oh, the jobs report is so great.
[08:56.520 --> 08:57.960]  Oh, look at these numbers.
[08:57.960 --> 08:58.960]  Oh, we're winning.
[08:58.960 --> 09:04.640]  Folks, I'm a big supporter of President Trump, and I want him to make the buzzer-beating
[09:04.640 --> 09:05.640]  game-winning shot.
[09:05.640 --> 09:09.520]  I want him to play the ace of spades, and I want to support him and be proud of that
[09:09.520 --> 09:15.040]  for the rest of my life and everything we've done here to help him get in office and beyond.
[09:15.040 --> 09:21.280]  But I'm no fool, and I'm not going to tell you America's winning right now.
[09:21.280 --> 09:27.040]  Now, is there a silver lining to everything that we're witnessing right now?
[09:27.040 --> 09:33.040]  Of course, and perhaps it's setting us up for a great victory.
[09:33.040 --> 09:37.520]  Maybe in the short term, maybe in the long term.
[09:37.520 --> 09:43.360]  But when I have riding going on for three straight weeks, when I have an economy that
[09:43.360 --> 09:53.400]  is not booming like it should be, I don't care what you print or say, I don't consider
[09:53.400 --> 09:54.560]  that winning.
[09:54.560 --> 09:58.560]  When I have Americans pit against one another because of mainstream media, I don't consider
[09:58.560 --> 09:59.560]  that winning.
[09:59.560 --> 10:07.640]  When I have known felons and purgers and people guilty of insurrection and treason running
[10:07.640 --> 10:12.880]  around this country continuing to engage in all their behavior, I don't consider that
[10:12.880 --> 10:14.400]  winning.
[10:14.400 --> 10:18.600]  But then again, I'm not part of the lowest common denominator Trump supporter that he's
[10:18.600 --> 10:30.640]  clearly trying to reach right now, and I don't think this audience is either.
[10:30.640 --> 10:37.400]  But look, the mainstream news has never been more boldface lying to your face.
[10:37.400 --> 10:43.080]  The hypocrisy has never been more abundant and clear.
[10:43.080 --> 10:50.040]  The disgust of the left and the Democrat Party has never been more clear.
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.600]  Their hatred for America, their hatred for Americans, their hatred for our bill of rights,
[10:54.600 --> 11:00.520]  their hatred for God, their hatred for everything that is good and righteous and true.
[11:00.520 --> 11:07.120]  And of course, their mask is pretending to fight for what is good and righteous is true.
[11:07.120 --> 11:15.880]  But then when they're presented with the facts in accordance to their movement or their protest,
[11:15.880 --> 11:22.600]  well they ignore the facts and they stick with their feelings.
[11:22.600 --> 11:24.920]  But America is definitely witnessing this.
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.680]  There is no doubt.
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.640]  And there is a major political shakeup in this country happening.
[11:33.640 --> 11:43.880]  Now, my concern is that we're not moving swiftly enough against this wholeheartedly.
[11:43.880 --> 11:49.800]  And so even if we do have some political victories in the short term and the long term, we've
[11:49.800 --> 11:59.680]  just lost another portion of the idea of America.
[11:59.680 --> 12:05.760]  We still don't have a fully open country and Democrats are trying to shut it down.
[12:05.760 --> 12:09.840]  I have family in St. Louis.
[12:09.840 --> 12:13.040]  They reopened the St. Louis Zoo, I guess today.
[12:13.040 --> 12:14.040]  Major attraction there.
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.080]  It can't go in without a mask.
[12:18.080 --> 12:19.080]  What?
[12:19.080 --> 12:23.480]  To say it's a requirement.
[12:23.480 --> 12:27.880]  In America, it's a requirement for you to wear a mask because the media faked the pandemic
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.720]  because they don't like the president.
[12:32.720 --> 12:42.280]  And that is what we cannot allow to be cemented into our culture and into our civilization,
[12:42.280 --> 12:51.000]  which is whatever the media wants to put out there, we just go along with it.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  Here's a headline here.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.480]  Thrilled Bear Jumps for Joy as Visitors Return to the St. Louis Zoo.
[12:55.480 --> 12:57.640]  Boy, that's fun.
[12:57.640 --> 13:00.480]  I'd like to go to the zoo.
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.000]  I ain't wearing a mask.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.840]  But that's the hinge on the door.
[13:09.840 --> 13:11.120]  The door is tyranny.
[13:11.120 --> 13:13.680]  The door frame is America.
[13:13.680 --> 13:20.240]  That hinge is the American people.
[13:20.240 --> 13:26.280]  So if you walk into a store or the zoo or whatever the case may be, and they say you need to
[13:26.280 --> 13:34.200]  wear a mask and you just comply, well, then that's the door shutting on America.
[13:34.200 --> 13:35.920]  You as the hinge.
[13:35.920 --> 13:43.880]  But if you, because the hinge is two parts, if you and your other fellow American say,
[13:43.880 --> 13:46.240]  hey, you know what?
[13:46.240 --> 13:47.560]  Why am I wearing this mask?
[13:47.560 --> 13:50.080]  It doesn't make sense.
[13:50.080 --> 13:51.720]  And then the other American says, yeah, you know what?
[13:51.720 --> 13:53.080]  It doesn't make sense to me either.
[13:53.080 --> 13:54.080]  They just make us do it.
[13:54.080 --> 13:56.440]  And then you say, well, you know what?
[13:56.440 --> 13:57.440]  I don't think I'm going to wear it.
[13:57.440 --> 13:58.440]  And they say, you know what?
[13:58.440 --> 14:02.080]  I don't think I'm going to wear it or make you wear it and say, okay, have a good day.
[14:02.080 --> 14:03.760]  The door didn't close.
[14:03.760 --> 14:08.640]  The door remains open and we don't live in a tyrannical nation.
[14:08.640 --> 14:20.160]  But if you accept that notion that you have to wear a mask, if you accept and we consciously
[14:20.160 --> 14:24.880]  agree that because the media said something or reported something and now we're responding
[14:24.880 --> 14:33.040]  to it just to get along, well, then that's how tyranny slams on America.
[14:33.040 --> 14:41.680]  But it takes we, the people as the hinge to decide if the door closes or not.
[14:41.680 --> 14:48.480]  And so all this petty bickering and all this stuff in the streets, again, that's all media
[14:48.480 --> 14:55.040]  derived, but this can all be solved in time.
[14:55.040 --> 15:01.920]  But if we all consciously don't recognize things like a fake pandemic done by the media,
[15:01.920 --> 15:05.960]  things like fake Russian collusion done by the media, oh yeah, they have cohorts as well
[15:05.960 --> 15:06.960]  in the deep state.
[15:06.960 --> 15:09.360]  We know who they are.
[15:09.360 --> 15:16.760]  But let's specifically talk about the media because the media is the syringe.
[15:16.760 --> 15:18.880]  The deep state is the poison.
[15:18.880 --> 15:23.800]  The media is the syringe.
[15:23.800 --> 15:28.080]  And so that's how they get all of this done, folks, and that's why you see all the writing
[15:28.080 --> 15:29.080]  and all the fighting.
[15:29.080 --> 15:33.640]  And by the way, I've got about six videos from this weekend.
[15:33.640 --> 15:35.920]  And I don't even want to be a part of this whole racial division thing.
[15:35.920 --> 15:39.080]  I just had to tell you what's going on.
[15:39.080 --> 15:43.960]  White people are now being targeted all across America for attack and it's being cheered
[15:43.960 --> 15:44.960]  on.
[15:44.960 --> 15:49.600]  I've got about six videos that will roll and it'll just make your heart ache because it's
[15:49.600 --> 15:56.200]  young children now, young children, black children versus white children, all because
[15:56.200 --> 15:57.800]  mainstream media lies.
[15:57.800 --> 16:00.360]  I'm always excited about InfoWars live products.
[16:00.360 --> 16:01.360]  They're amazing.
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.360]  They're cutting edge.
[16:02.360 --> 16:03.360]  You love them.
[16:03.360 --> 16:04.360]  I love them.
[16:04.360 --> 16:06.400]  And they find the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[16:06.400 --> 16:13.000]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[16:13.000 --> 16:20.760]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[16:20.760 --> 16:23.080]  And there's another innovation.
[16:23.080 --> 16:25.080]  It's the Spray Cap.
[16:25.080 --> 16:31.280]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[16:31.280 --> 16:32.680]  it in a really great way.
[16:32.680 --> 16:35.880]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.720]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes, but I just love it.
[16:40.720 --> 16:43.080]  Finally it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[16:43.080 --> 16:44.840]  So this is a real innovation.
[16:44.840 --> 16:48.920]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[16:48.920 --> 16:52.760]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out, smells great.
[16:52.760 --> 16:54.680]  It's so refreshing.
[16:54.680 --> 16:57.760]  This is a big winner.
[16:57.760 --> 17:01.800]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[17:01.800 --> 17:07.560]  The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray
[17:07.560 --> 17:08.560]  bottle.
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.400]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[17:14.400 --> 17:17.560]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[17:17.560 --> 17:21.640]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's great at work, but this
[17:21.640 --> 17:26.800]  is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the throat
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.120]  and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[17:31.120 --> 17:32.600]  We're really excited about it.
[17:32.600 --> 17:34.720]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[17:34.720 --> 17:39.200]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[17:39.200 --> 17:43.280]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[17:43.280 --> 17:46.760]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[17:46.760 --> 17:52.960]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[17:52.960 --> 18:00.920]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[18:00.920 --> 18:16.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:16.920 --> 18:20.080]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[18:20.080 --> 18:27.400]  It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Croyer.
[18:27.400 --> 18:32.640]  I just got to get this off my chest and then I'm going to go to the news, but I just don't
[18:32.640 --> 18:37.960]  understand what the hell President Trump is doing so far this year.
[18:37.960 --> 18:43.080]  I really don't get it.
[18:43.080 --> 18:50.000]  Failed to me on the coronavirus outbreak, didn't close down the borders, didn't make
[18:50.000 --> 18:55.120]  enough of an issue about China, and now people are still wearing masks, now new mask orders
[18:55.120 --> 18:57.000]  are coming out.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.920]  No spread, no virus, all fake.
[18:58.920 --> 19:04.880]  It turns out the Democrats sent them into the nursing homes, literally murdered them.
[19:04.880 --> 19:12.520]  By the way, Steve Scalise, actually we guys find Steve Scalise released an issue or something
[19:12.520 --> 19:20.680]  basically demanding to know why the Democrat governor sent COVID infected patients to the
[19:20.680 --> 19:26.360]  nursing homes, which is responsible for like 80% of the COVID deaths in this country.
[19:26.360 --> 19:31.240]  Democrat governors murdered your grandmother, all for their cause of getting Trump out of
[19:31.240 --> 19:34.200]  office with a pandemic.
[19:34.200 --> 19:41.640]  That's how sick these people are, and they're running rampant.
[19:41.640 --> 19:45.600]  You got riots going on in the streets for three weeks now.
[19:45.600 --> 19:48.720]  Hey, you know what, if Trump measures it, hey, I don't want to step in, I don't want
[19:48.720 --> 19:53.240]  to do it, it's a trap, it's a set up, fine, I can understand that, I'll agree to that.
[19:53.240 --> 20:01.440]  But he should have said Democrat riots 500 times every day by now, so that branding sticks.
[20:01.440 --> 20:06.080]  And then the Democrats won't want to promote their little riots anymore, oh, but nope.
[20:06.080 --> 20:12.600]  And now he's issuing an executive order on police reform, which is a total fail.
[20:12.600 --> 20:21.080]  The police don't need reform folks, the law needs reformed, the media needs reformed,
[20:21.080 --> 20:25.840]  reporting it lightly.
[20:25.840 --> 20:29.600]  It's not about police reform, it's about law reform.
[20:29.600 --> 20:37.600]  It's time to get the police out of our business.
[20:37.600 --> 20:41.280]  But no, we just blame the police instead of the war on drugs.
[20:41.280 --> 20:48.360]  Instead of all these little petty things, police want to bother you about like a seatbelt.
[20:48.360 --> 20:49.640]  Get out of my car.
[20:49.640 --> 20:54.000]  Oh, you're on your cell phone, you have a whole computer screen on your dash.
[20:54.000 --> 20:57.720]  Well you use cell phone, that's a citation.
[20:57.720 --> 21:04.080]  Law reform, by the way, all this law was written, most of it was written by Democrats, mandatory
[21:04.080 --> 21:07.600]  minimums and sentencing and all that stuff.
[21:07.600 --> 21:13.160]  But there's your big one right there, the war on drugs, you want to stop most of this
[21:13.160 --> 21:17.320]  police brutality incidents and the war on drugs.
[21:17.320 --> 21:20.640]  Are crackheads going to go out and do crack and are heroin addicts going to go out and
[21:20.640 --> 21:22.240]  do heroin and ruin their lives?
[21:22.240 --> 21:23.240]  They sure are.
[21:23.240 --> 21:26.840]  It's none of the police's business to stop that.
[21:26.840 --> 21:35.000]  Oh, but you see it's all about pulling in those drugs, making that money.
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.400]  It's just a sick joke and then just blame police.
[21:40.400 --> 21:45.160]  Anyway, again, Trump has all the ace of spades in his hand.
[21:45.160 --> 21:46.520]  Is he going to play them?
[21:46.520 --> 21:54.320]  Bring the troops home, build the wall, cut the taxes, arrest Hillary Clinton, arrest
[21:54.320 --> 22:05.440]  Barack Obama, arrest the leaders of the Democrat Party, which is a domestic terror group.
[22:05.440 --> 22:12.280]  Black Lives Matter is the Democrat Party, Antifa is the Democrat Party, Occupy Wall
[22:12.280 --> 22:13.960]  Street is the Democrat Party.
[22:13.960 --> 22:20.640]  And all the Democrat Party and all of these fake social justice movements, all the funding
[22:20.640 --> 22:27.440]  goes right back to the Democrat Party, all of it, including Planned Parenthood.
[22:27.440 --> 22:36.720]  I mean, can you imagine objectively, let's say an alien actually lands in the United
[22:36.720 --> 22:43.320]  States, just decides, okay, let's see here, oh, what's this Planned Parenthood thing
[22:43.320 --> 22:44.320]  I see?
[22:44.320 --> 22:51.280]  Say, oh, that's just a government funded institution that also gives taxpayer dollars to one political
[22:51.280 --> 22:53.000]  party only the Democrat Party.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.160]  Oh, okay, but what is, what is, what do they do?
[22:56.160 --> 22:58.640]  Oh, they murder babies.
[22:58.640 --> 23:02.760]  Oh, they murder babies.
[23:02.760 --> 23:06.040]  We've got a ray gun up on my spaceship up there.
[23:06.040 --> 23:09.000]  We're going to just go ahead and just blast this country into oblivion, okay?
[23:09.000 --> 23:10.600]  You murdered 50 million babies.
[23:10.600 --> 23:17.520]  You're done, it's all the Democrats, everything.
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.560]  You know, look, folks, it's just unbelievable at this point.
[23:22.560 --> 23:30.900]  And America sees through it, but my fear is, my fear is, if Trump doesn't take the buzzer
[23:30.900 --> 23:36.600]  beating shot, if Trump doesn't play the ace of spades, this country's done.
[23:36.600 --> 23:43.040]  And everybody's so committed and hopeful and faithful in Trump that if he doesn't come
[23:43.040 --> 23:47.400]  through, we, we have no other eggs in the basket.
[23:47.400 --> 23:49.960]  We've put all of our eggs in the Trump basket.
[23:49.960 --> 23:52.720]  Hey, again, I want Trump to come through.
[23:52.720 --> 23:54.800]  He's the greatest president in modern day history, no doubt.
[23:54.800 --> 23:59.600]  But if I put all my eggs in the Trump basket and then that basket gets lit on fire and
[23:59.600 --> 24:05.880]  burns at a Democrat riot and nobody stops it, then I don't have a basket or eggs.
[24:05.880 --> 24:10.720]  So I think it's time for Americans to put eggs in their own basket.
[24:10.720 --> 24:11.920]  What does that mean?
[24:11.920 --> 24:14.520]  Getting prepared, folks.
[24:14.520 --> 24:15.520]  Getting prepared.
[24:15.520 --> 24:21.120]  And so, hey, we've been selling emergency food at infowestore.com for years telling people
[24:21.120 --> 24:23.360]  to get prepared.
[24:23.360 --> 24:28.240]  So this isn't just a, hey, things are getting really bad, no, you can look outside in major
[24:28.240 --> 24:30.280]  cities and see what's going on.
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.680]  Now if you live out in the country in a conservative area and a Republican area, then you're probably
[24:34.680 --> 24:37.680]  not experiencing that.
[24:37.680 --> 24:42.480]  But if you're in a Democrat run area, yeah, you're seeing rioting and looting and arson
[24:42.480 --> 24:46.640]  and rape and murder, regular thing now.
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.960]  And they want to shut down the police, so I don't think it's going to get any better.
[24:50.960 --> 24:55.080]  So if you can't get out or if you can get out, you're going to want to have some emergency
[24:55.080 --> 24:59.880]  food with you because they, the Democrats at the end of this with George Soros in China
[24:59.880 --> 25:06.600]  want to stop our supply chain, which of course would cut out the food supply.
[25:06.600 --> 25:12.760]  Now what do you think is going to happen when the riders and the looters go to Walmart and
[25:12.760 --> 25:17.600]  there's no food left for them to steal because the supply chain has been shut down?
[25:17.600 --> 25:22.280]  Well, they're going to come to your door, folks.
[25:22.280 --> 25:26.680]  So in that respect, this is why we have the second amendment.
[25:26.680 --> 25:30.800]  I'm sure a lot of people that were anti-second amendment are now changing their mind on that.
[25:30.800 --> 25:32.160]  So again, it's overlining.
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.080]  But infowarstore.com, folks, not just the emergency food that we have available right
[25:36.080 --> 25:43.560]  now, but also top supplements are on sale, 60% off some of these top supplements at infowarstore.com.
[25:43.560 --> 25:48.800]  Don't forget about the water filters, the air filters, the brand new survival shield
[25:48.800 --> 25:52.040]  X2 nascent iodine spray.
[25:52.040 --> 25:58.200]  So this is a spray now, if you prefer that way of doing the nascent iodine instead of
[25:58.200 --> 26:03.240]  the dropper, it's both available at infowarstore.com.
[26:03.240 --> 26:07.960]  And if you want to wear your colors loud and proud, we've got t-shirts at infowarstore.com
[26:07.960 --> 26:08.960]  as well.
[26:08.960 --> 26:12.720]  Some of them subtle, some of them loud and in your face with just a bright red InfoWars
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.360]  logo right there on the chest.
[26:14.360 --> 26:20.520]  But it's all possible at infowarstore.com, everything we do here.
[26:20.520 --> 26:27.880]  And so you know that at the end of the day, what we stand for is truth and justice and
[26:27.880 --> 26:32.640]  America and independence, rugged individualism.
[26:32.640 --> 26:36.600]  That's what we stand for.
[26:36.600 --> 26:41.040]  Now my job is to not protect Trump by all means and all costs.
[26:41.040 --> 26:48.280]  My job is to protect America, protect truth, and to just give you all the information without
[26:48.280 --> 26:50.040]  the filter of the mainstream news.
[26:50.040 --> 26:53.000]  Did we just release a onesie from at infowarstore.com?
[26:53.000 --> 26:54.000]  Baby Lives Matter?
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.040]  Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing ever.
[26:56.040 --> 26:58.600]  I was talking to my Patriot supplier, great suppliers.
[26:58.600 --> 27:01.560]  You can now say four weeks on average for storeable food.
[27:01.560 --> 27:04.080]  It's the highest quality, they've got it.
[27:04.080 --> 27:09.080]  Use this little rest we have, hot in the current to come up to the service, get some air before
[27:09.080 --> 27:10.280]  you get sucked back down.
[27:10.280 --> 27:12.800]  I personally am ordering more storeable food.
[27:12.800 --> 27:15.480]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[27:15.480 --> 27:21.280]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully stop the globalists and we've
[27:21.280 --> 27:26.120]  given them a good run and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but we're going
[27:26.120 --> 27:28.520]  to still go down the hard road now.
[27:28.520 --> 27:32.680]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this,
[27:32.680 --> 27:34.400]  but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[27:34.400 --> 27:37.080]  You need to get high quality storeable food, it's something you need.
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.960]  We have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins,
[27:40.960 --> 27:45.800]  so please take care of your storeable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.960]  in now, so you get it, so you have it, it's in great containers, high quality.
[27:49.960 --> 27:53.960]  Last 25 years, get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you
[27:53.960 --> 27:56.840]  ain't seen nothing yet.
[27:56.840 --> 27:59.640]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[27:59.640 --> 28:00.640]  Hello, can you hear me?
[28:00.640 --> 28:01.640]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[28:01.640 --> 28:07.080]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[28:07.080 --> 28:08.320]  be talking right now with you, man.
[28:08.320 --> 28:09.840]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[28:09.840 --> 28:15.280]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver and Tuber
[28:15.280 --> 28:21.680]  Forest has changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we
[28:21.680 --> 28:29.360]  are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola, and
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.000]  I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  for that, man.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.360]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term, high quality energy powder
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.080]  there is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his
[28:42.080 --> 28:45.200]  name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.000]  this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest,
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.760]  but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so
[28:52.760 --> 28:53.760]  that means a lot to me, thank you.
[28:53.760 --> 28:56.000]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.600]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true
[29:00.600 --> 29:02.080]  atomic iodine.
[29:02.080 --> 29:06.320]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[29:06.320 --> 29:10.480]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine, after extensive development, it's finally here.
[29:10.480 --> 29:15.160]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[29:15.160 --> 29:19.440]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[29:19.440 --> 29:23.640]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day, and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[29:23.640 --> 29:25.960]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[29:25.960 --> 29:27.680]  I can personally feel the difference.
[29:27.680 --> 29:32.040]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health, as well as healthy
[29:32.040 --> 29:36.120]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[29:36.120 --> 29:40.680]  Men may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[29:40.680 --> 29:45.120]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine, and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[29:45.120 --> 29:46.120]  today.
[29:46.120 --> 29:51.200]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfowarsStore.com before we sell
[29:51.200 --> 29:53.120]  out of our new limited first shipment.
[29:53.120 --> 30:18.120]  That's InfowarsStore.com.
[30:18.120 --> 30:20.120]  Alright, let's get into some of this news here.
[30:20.120 --> 30:27.120]  We're going to be hearing from Alex Jones coming up in the next segment.
[30:27.120 --> 30:40.200]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we've got our crew that is in CHAS or CHOP, or maybe they've
[30:40.200 --> 30:46.080]  renamed it now, which is up there in Seattle, and so we're going to be hearing from them
[30:46.080 --> 30:47.560]  coming up.
[30:47.560 --> 30:51.880]  But it's amazing, the silence.
[30:51.880 --> 30:52.880]  Are you hearing that?
[30:52.880 --> 30:54.760]  Because I'm not.
[30:54.760 --> 31:03.560]  Where is the left and the Democrats and the media in an uproar?
[31:03.560 --> 31:09.880]  Photos confirm CHAS warlord Ross Simone was running guns from the trunk of his Tesla.
[31:09.880 --> 31:13.000]  And you've got videos of him doing this.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.120]  I'd like to know where he got that Tesla.
[31:16.120 --> 31:23.080]  Now I am pretty sure, last I checked, if you buy a new Tesla, you have to put down a pretty
[31:23.080 --> 31:28.000]  significant down payment to Tesla.
[31:28.000 --> 31:36.680]  Now I didn't realize Ross Simone was that successful of a rapper, but people are questioning
[31:36.680 --> 31:38.720]  the legitimacy of that Tesla.
[31:38.720 --> 31:40.360]  But again, where's David Hogg?
[31:40.360 --> 31:42.800]  Where are all the marchers?
[31:42.800 --> 31:44.640]  Where are the anti-gun marchers?
[31:44.640 --> 31:45.640]  Where are the gun grabbers?
[31:45.640 --> 31:46.640]  Where are the Democrats?
[31:46.640 --> 31:47.640]  Where are the media?
[31:47.640 --> 31:48.640]  Silent.
[31:48.640 --> 31:49.640]  Why?
[31:49.640 --> 32:01.800]  Because this CHAS and a Vigilante gun hander outer, I don't even know what you'd call this,
[32:01.800 --> 32:08.600]  gun disbursement, no, they're silent on that.
[32:08.600 --> 32:12.760]  And you know, I'll be honest with you, I'm kind of a second amendment purist.
[32:12.760 --> 32:16.520]  And so I almost don't even care that he's handing out guns.
[32:16.520 --> 32:22.280]  But the hypocrisy of the left, it just shows that every, every movement that the left is
[32:22.280 --> 32:25.400]  involved in is a fraud.
[32:25.400 --> 32:26.400]  Every movement.
[32:26.400 --> 32:28.240]  They had all these marchers.
[32:28.240 --> 32:30.360]  What were the marchers led by David Hogg?
[32:30.360 --> 32:31.360]  What were they guys?
[32:31.360 --> 32:33.960]  I can't think of the catchphrase.
[32:33.960 --> 32:34.960]  Our lives matter or something.
[32:34.960 --> 32:35.960]  Does anybody remember that?
[32:35.960 --> 32:36.960]  Look at that.
[32:36.960 --> 32:40.200]  I can't even, people don't even remember it.
[32:40.200 --> 32:41.200]  Nobody remembers it.
[32:41.200 --> 32:43.240]  They're handing out it all this.
[32:43.240 --> 32:45.040]  That's how flaky it all is.
[32:45.040 --> 32:46.760]  It was huge for like three months.
[32:46.760 --> 32:49.800]  It was the biggest thing with David Hogg and millions of people marching all around the
[32:49.800 --> 32:54.320]  world and book tours and media tours and everything.
[32:54.320 --> 32:58.440]  But now that their Democrats have taken over Seattle and are just handing out guns to anybody
[32:58.440 --> 33:02.280]  on the street, well, now they're silent.
[33:02.280 --> 33:07.000]  Seriously, what was the name of that David Hogg marches they used to do across the nation?
[33:07.000 --> 33:08.000]  They had them here in Austin.
[33:08.000 --> 33:09.480]  They had them all across the nation, folks.
[33:09.480 --> 33:13.080]  It was a huge thing for about three months.
[33:13.080 --> 33:14.240]  Nobody can even remember.
[33:14.240 --> 33:22.360]  That's how, that's how vapid these leftist movements are.
[33:22.360 --> 33:25.360]  But you see, they're all connected, folks.
[33:25.360 --> 33:27.400]  They're all connected.
[33:27.400 --> 33:29.320]  And the story at info wars.com highlights it.
[33:29.320 --> 33:34.480]  You an official admits coronavirus, black lives matter, climate change, agendas are inseparable.
[33:34.480 --> 33:41.000]  Yeah, because they're all run and funded by the same people.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.600]  Same with their little gun grabbing cult, the little gun merit march cult, March for
[33:46.600 --> 33:47.920]  our lives.
[33:47.920 --> 33:49.160]  That's what it was.
[33:49.160 --> 33:50.880]  I got it.
[33:50.880 --> 33:51.880]  March for our lives.
[33:51.880 --> 33:58.720]  Go ahead guys, plug in March for our lives and you'll get B roll of thousands of people
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.200]  led by the Democrats, led by the leftist media saying how we need to get guns off the streets.
[34:04.200 --> 34:09.720]  We need gun control, we can't have rifles or any of this stuff.
[34:09.720 --> 34:13.520]  And then as soon as the Democrat rioters take over a city and start handing out guns
[34:13.520 --> 34:19.600]  like candy, well, they're silent.
[34:19.600 --> 34:23.200]  Because they're frauds.
[34:23.200 --> 34:33.280]  Every alphabet soup acronym and movement they come up with at the root of it is all the
[34:33.280 --> 34:43.240]  same folks, anti American, the sooner we figure that out and respond accordingly, the better
[34:43.240 --> 34:52.200]  off we will be CNN compiles list of unforgivable statues and place names suggesting they should
[34:52.200 --> 34:54.000]  be changed or removed again.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.320]  What is the ultimate agenda?
[34:55.320 --> 35:02.200]  Where is this slope and well, no more America.
[35:02.200 --> 35:05.560]  No more America.
[35:05.560 --> 35:09.800]  That's where the leftist agenda ultimately ends.
[35:09.800 --> 35:14.280]  But of course now you've got, I mean, I don't believe polls, all these polls that they even
[35:14.280 --> 35:18.400]  run on Fox News saying Biden is beating Trump by like 10 points.
[35:18.400 --> 35:24.840]  Fox News will probably be anti Trump by October, but Gallup poll finds that only a quarter
[35:24.840 --> 35:29.200]  of Democrats are extremely proud to be American.
[35:29.200 --> 35:33.320]  No, they hate America folks.
[35:33.320 --> 35:38.160]  And any of the Democrats that don't hate America, they're leaving the Democrat Party because
[35:38.160 --> 35:45.120]  they realize that that's what the Democrat Party has become is the hate America party.
[35:45.120 --> 35:48.320]  Kind of like the media.
[35:48.320 --> 35:52.760]  Here's the LA Times partygoers have been packing Arizona bars.
[35:52.760 --> 35:57.320]  Now the state is a coronavirus hotspot.
[35:57.320 --> 35:59.560]  You guys are funny.
[35:59.560 --> 36:04.120]  I remember that article you wrote about all the riots and looting and arson and all the
[36:04.120 --> 36:08.360]  protesters of George Floyd saying how they're causing a coronavirus outbreak.
[36:08.360 --> 36:11.480]  Oh, wait, you didn't write that article.
[36:11.480 --> 36:15.920]  It's when there's a Trump rally or Americans wanting to go to a restaurant or a beach that
[36:15.920 --> 36:19.840]  you say, oh, you have to stay inside for coronavirus.
[36:19.840 --> 36:24.520]  But if it's your protesters out burning and looting and rioting and murdering and raping,
[36:24.520 --> 36:25.880]  well then that's just fine.
[36:25.880 --> 36:32.040]  Hey, if I was a coronavirus, I'd want to avoid those people too.
[36:32.040 --> 36:39.080]  Breitbart.com report 34% of Michigan coronavirus deaths linked to nursing homes who sent the
[36:39.080 --> 36:41.240]  COVID into the nursing homes.
[36:41.240 --> 36:52.520]  That bitch Gretchen Wittmer, Wittmer, that is a sick, sick woman.
[36:52.520 --> 36:59.280]  I can't believe we have mass murderers holding governorships right now.
[36:59.280 --> 37:06.520]  Wittmer, Cuomo, these are mass murderers.
[37:06.520 --> 37:14.000]  And you know, quite frankly, folks, the fact that we haven't put these people behind bars
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.640]  is almost so pathetic that we don't even deserve this country anymore.
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.080]  I'm going to be honest.
[37:22.080 --> 37:27.520]  The fact that we don't have 10,000 people marching to have Wittmer hauled into a max
[37:27.520 --> 37:33.200]  security prison and Governor Cuomo hauled into a max security prison, you know, we
[37:33.200 --> 37:39.800]  just brought back federal executions, why don't we start, why don't we send a little
[37:39.800 --> 37:44.200]  COVID nursing home to Andrew Cuomo?
[37:44.200 --> 37:50.800]  Why don't we send a little COVID nursing home to Gretchen Wittmer?
[37:50.800 --> 37:51.800]  What does that translate to?
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.480]  Well, you can make the translation yourself.
[37:55.480 --> 38:02.000]  But no, folks, I really think we deserve to lose this country.
[38:02.000 --> 38:11.240]  If we have premeditated killers in governorships, and it's just right out there in front of
[38:11.240 --> 38:17.960]  you for all to see, and we don't even organize and march against these people in positions
[38:17.960 --> 38:25.320]  of power, but the media has us marching for a felon, a criminal.
[38:25.320 --> 38:36.200]  Well, I don't think we deserve America, quite frankly, 85% of Independence U.S. restaurants
[38:36.200 --> 38:42.240]  may close by year end, storiedinfowars.com, yeah, 24 hour fitness is also closing a bunch
[38:42.240 --> 38:43.240]  of gyms.
[38:43.240 --> 38:45.640]  So, I mean, there's the fascism.
[38:45.640 --> 38:47.160]  Where's the anti fascists?
[38:47.160 --> 38:50.160]  The fascism is the COVID.
[38:50.160 --> 39:01.560]  Oh, but the economy's doing great, saw a report on Fox.
[39:01.560 --> 39:04.800]  And now in California, if you do want to keep your gym open, you basically have to make
[39:04.800 --> 39:11.200]  pods that are separated by some plastic liner or some stupid crap.
[39:11.200 --> 39:16.480]  Yeah, because everybody loves working out in a plastic bag.
[39:16.480 --> 39:19.760]  Really fling to mountain resorts as cities burn.
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.720]  Yeah, there's no doubt there's going to be an exodus from Democrat cities again, folks.
[39:24.720 --> 39:27.360]  I just wonder, hey, look, this is all good.
[39:27.360 --> 39:28.720]  There's silver linings to all this.
[39:28.720 --> 39:33.920]  This is all a long extended political revolution that we're experiencing.
[39:33.920 --> 39:35.560]  I just don't know if we have time.
[39:35.560 --> 39:36.560]  Okay.
[39:36.560 --> 39:37.560]  I really don't.
[39:37.560 --> 39:39.080]  We have a media that fakes Russian collusion.
[39:39.080 --> 39:42.160]  We have just these small lats that fake hate crimes.
[39:42.160 --> 39:43.160]  They fake impeachment.
[39:43.160 --> 39:44.320]  They fake quid pro quo.
[39:44.320 --> 39:45.320]  They fake pandemics.
[39:45.320 --> 39:47.640]  They, I mean, they fake everything, folks.
[39:47.640 --> 39:51.960]  They have governors that premeditatedly send people infected into nursing homes to kill
[39:51.960 --> 39:52.960]  people.
[39:52.960 --> 39:53.960]  I mean, these are, these are hardened criminals.
[39:53.960 --> 39:55.460]  We need to clear up.

[43:58.520 --> 44:13.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:13.360 --> 44:19.640]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[44:19.640 --> 44:24.480]  front lines of the info war.
[44:24.480 --> 44:33.720]  Ed Kuhn Quisling was the prime minister of Norway at the beginning of World War II and
[44:33.720 --> 44:40.720]  he ordered the Norwegian military to stand down and allow Hitler to take over the country
[44:40.720 --> 44:49.720]  and then use that nation as a launch point to launch attacks into other surrounding nations.
[44:49.720 --> 44:55.080]  We get the word quisling from Prime Minister Quisling.
[44:55.080 --> 45:02.240]  It is the modern parlance for someone at a high level in the state apparatus that works
[45:02.240 --> 45:07.600]  for the foreign hostile government to undermine the nation and basically open the drawbridge
[45:07.600 --> 45:13.600]  and allow the enemy in to then set up its own government through the puppet quislings
[45:13.600 --> 45:14.840]  over the population.
[45:14.840 --> 45:21.720]  Again, quisling did not invent high treason far from it, it is just simply a more modern
[45:21.720 --> 45:24.440]  case study example.
[45:24.440 --> 45:29.520]  In fact, Hitler's first big major successes was through quislings.
[45:29.520 --> 45:31.640]  They had quislings inside the Austrian government.
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.200]  They had quislings working inside the Russian government.
[45:36.200 --> 45:42.640]  They had quislings on the greatest scale, not in Norway, but in France.
[45:42.640 --> 45:46.760]  That's why Hitler was able to defeat the French who he couldn't defeat in World War
[45:46.760 --> 45:49.280]  I when he himself was just a corporal.
[45:49.280 --> 45:55.400]  But if you pull back from it and you look at the model of how the Nazis were able to
[45:55.400 --> 46:00.560]  go in and undermine France, they were making deals from the time Hitler got in power in
[46:00.560 --> 46:10.520]  1933 until the time he invaded France in 1940 with the French high command that if they
[46:10.520 --> 46:16.120]  let Hitler take over, Hitler would quietly pay them off before the invasion and would
[46:16.120 --> 46:22.320]  set them up in power, moving the main seat of power from Paris to the south of France
[46:22.320 --> 46:23.800]  in Vichy, France.
[46:23.800 --> 46:29.160]  That's why it's called Vichy, France and the traitors of World War II.
[46:29.160 --> 46:37.280]  That's why the French depitulated was not cowardice of their soldiers, but was high treason
[46:37.280 --> 46:41.480]  in the high command of the French government.
[46:41.480 --> 46:46.080]  That's why it's called high treason because it's going on at the highest levels, either
[46:46.080 --> 46:51.400]  attempting to take out the king, the president, or if a president or a king engages in treason
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.640]  against the nation or the people, that too is high treason.
[46:55.640 --> 46:59.760]  It is betraying the people, it is betraying the country, it is betraying the culture and
[46:59.760 --> 47:03.320]  it is the essence of what we're facing today.
[47:03.320 --> 47:09.040]  Now that we've had just a brief little tiny snapshot of these fascinating parts of history,
[47:09.040 --> 47:17.040]  let's move forward to 1990, 1991, and then 2003 in Iraq.
[47:17.040 --> 47:23.680]  In both cases, it's classified, but much of it's been declassified, that the U.S. military,
[47:23.680 --> 47:27.240]  through contacts they had in the Iraqi military, back from when we'd been allied with them
[47:27.240 --> 47:31.920]  during the Iraqi-Iranian war, or the Iran-Iraq war, as it's probably called, and almost
[47:31.920 --> 47:39.720]  all of Saddam's generals also stood down when the main war started and only a few units
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.160]  and few organizations, like the Republican Guard, put up a fight.
[47:44.160 --> 47:46.480]  So that's how you win a war.
[47:46.480 --> 47:52.320]  In most cases, it is basically infiltrating and buying off the enemy's high command before
[47:52.320 --> 47:57.360]  a shot is ever fired, and then that way you're insured of being able to control the situation.
[47:57.360 --> 47:58.600]  So this is done over and over again.
[47:58.600 --> 48:02.760]  Now, let's look at the United Nations, set up by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds on
[48:02.760 --> 48:03.760]  record.
[48:03.760 --> 48:04.760]  They paid for it.
[48:04.760 --> 48:05.760]  That's on record, folks.
[48:05.760 --> 48:06.760]  Not a conspiracy theory.
[48:06.760 --> 48:07.760]  Look it up.
[48:07.760 --> 48:12.280]  In Presidio, San Francisco, in New York, in The Hague, and the Netherlands.
[48:12.280 --> 48:17.840]  And once they set all of this up, it was believed, for the general public, it was about peace
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.000]  and love and helping starving children, but really it was about setting up a planetary
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.720]  corporate government that could then come back into nation states and begin undermining
[48:26.720 --> 48:32.400]  city, county, and state governments, buying off politicians and piece by piece taking
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.960]  control through a process called unionization by the United Nations and holding all these
[48:38.960 --> 48:45.880]  different organizations and groups together via the megabanks endless fiat currency printing
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.680]  that's given to them to have a monopoly of control is big tech.
[48:51.680 --> 48:55.920]  Five companies funded by the megabanks, funded by the same group that created the United
[48:55.920 --> 49:03.240]  Nations to surveil and control and watch every movement and be able to selectively then only
[49:03.240 --> 49:08.440]  support certain corporations and groups and the key.
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.280]  Sensor and suppress the population being able to communicate and try to throw off the bonds
[49:13.280 --> 49:19.000]  of globalism and international corporate fascist control and the communist models they try
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.440]  to impose over their slave colonies.
[49:22.440 --> 49:28.680]  This is the greatest authoritarian system the planet's ever seen, it is the most cold
[49:28.680 --> 49:31.320]  blooded, it is the most wicked.
[49:31.320 --> 49:38.680]  Now I'll list some of the other sectors of this system that ties together with the axes
[49:38.680 --> 49:44.800]  of tyrannies supporting it in the fascist structure and that's where we are today, all
[49:44.800 --> 49:51.280]  the major mega corporations, the entire Fortune 100, all the major central banks, all the
[49:51.280 --> 49:57.400]  major entertainment companies, all the major universities, the communist Chinese, the unelected
[49:57.400 --> 50:05.200]  tyrannical EU, the America Hating Hollywood, the out of control grounds and command bases
[50:05.200 --> 50:11.240]  of oppression and anti-free speech, Marxist, london's evil universities are all completely
[50:11.240 --> 50:16.960]  unified behind open world government and the end of the west and you notice as the globalist
[50:16.960 --> 50:23.840]  launch their full worldwide takeover, the Pope is now a Marxist-Leninist, actually undermining
[50:23.840 --> 50:31.040]  classic canon law of the Catholic Church, 180 degrees overthrowing it, every major
[50:31.040 --> 50:38.440]  sector has been taken control of by the globalist and this is 21st century modern warfare but
[50:38.440 --> 50:44.040]  the way to defeat it is to understand it's a full spectrum takeover because the central
[50:44.040 --> 50:49.280]  banks control the money and are owned by a handful of families, all the other corporations,
[50:49.280 --> 50:53.720]  all the other big tech companies, all the other media outlets get in line and so that's
[50:53.720 --> 50:58.400]  why you're seeing communist Chinese level censorship all across the western world against
[50:58.400 --> 51:03.360]  anybody that questions dangerous vaccines, anybody that questions open borders, anybody
[51:03.360 --> 51:08.200]  that questions abortion or even forced abortion, anybody that questions censorship, anybody
[51:08.200 --> 51:13.800]  that wants to have sovereignty because this is the new old order emerging, they've gone
[51:13.800 --> 51:19.480]  as David Ike properly says from hiding it to selling it and so remember that's why
[51:19.480 --> 51:24.800]  you see at the United Nations in New York and that's why you see on CNN, that's why
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.440]  you see in the news, of course the UN is going to run things, of course the WHO tells us
[51:29.440 --> 51:36.440]  how to handle the COVID hoax, of course we have the strong city program set up by Obama
[51:36.440 --> 51:41.600]  where the UN is in our cities basically taking over the police forces but first they've got
[51:41.600 --> 51:47.120]  to sabotage them, undermine them, focus on a few bad cases to demonize the police in
[51:47.120 --> 51:51.960]  general to begin the defunding of them to break their will so they will then become
[51:51.960 --> 51:57.640]  clients of the globalist just as they did in Europe but in the case of Europe, Hitler
[51:57.640 --> 52:02.480]  was set up to set up the EU with Edward VIII the king of England, he was told in secret
[52:02.480 --> 52:06.680]  British treaties that have now come out that he would be allowed to do that, the Nazis
[52:06.680 --> 52:12.760]  who were bad guys were set up, they were taken down, Europe was imploded and then the new
[52:12.760 --> 52:17.600]  EU original plan could later be brought forward but that's how they got control of the nation
[52:17.600 --> 52:22.240]  states of Europe, that's how they got control of the nation states, other parts of the world
[52:22.240 --> 52:27.440]  was first setting up war, setting up economic collapse to then knock out the nation state
[52:27.440 --> 52:33.400]  and bring in martial plan type operations to reorganize those countries under debt that
[52:33.400 --> 52:37.800]  the IMF and World Bank, the International Bank of Settlements would give them and all
[52:37.800 --> 52:42.800]  this is written about in books by Brzezinski and by Kissinger and by Quigley and in the
[52:42.800 --> 52:48.440]  Council on Foreign Relations, bi-monthly publication, foreign affairs, it's all there and we sit
[52:48.440 --> 52:53.120]  here like ignorant morons wondering why it's all so coordinated and why it's so out of
[52:53.120 --> 52:59.120]  control and why there's open high treason going on and open collaboration at the UN
[52:59.120 --> 53:04.480]  facility with former US Attorney Generals like Loretta Lynch saying the UN is our boss
[53:04.480 --> 53:08.160]  and we're taking over at the city level and once we get rid of the police and put our
[53:08.160 --> 53:12.960]  own people in, then they're coming for the guns and then they're going to isolate the
[53:12.960 --> 53:16.940]  countryside and they're going to take full control, I mean this is a very systematic
[53:16.940 --> 53:22.040]  plan similar to what the Bolsheviks did but much more high tech and that's why they put
[53:22.040 --> 53:25.480]  their people in the military leadership positions, that's why they've got this whole thing set
[53:25.480 --> 53:29.840]  up, there is an American resistance and all of you are part of this and there's a resistance
[53:29.840 --> 53:34.080]  in Australia and Brazil and Europe but we have to really get aggressive and call these
[53:34.080 --> 53:39.520]  people out for what they are, globalist traders that are trying to set up a Chinese communist
[53:39.520 --> 53:45.520]  model where billionaires sit offshore, pay no taxes, run slave shops, deindustrialize
[53:45.520 --> 53:51.440]  our countries and totally dominate and control us in the name of political correctness simply
[53:51.440 --> 53:56.000]  playing different ethnic groups off against each other, it's a classical great game like
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.120]  the British used in India, divide and conquer strategy, alright this is my report on the
[54:02.120 --> 54:06.080]  real meaning of quisling, all of you don't need to be useful idiots, you need to be the
[54:06.080 --> 54:09.800]  leaders you are and I know you are, you're the core of the resistance that understands
[54:09.800 --> 54:14.480]  this, so please take this live report and share it once we archive it at Band-Aid video,
[54:14.480 --> 54:17.920]  take it and share it because people need to understand why this is all happening, the
[54:17.920 --> 54:25.200]  COVID lockdown round two, all of it is about siege, strangling America, bringing star knees
[54:25.200 --> 54:29.960]  under UN control, we are now inside world government, we need to declare we're under
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.940]  world government and declare that it's illegitimate just like we did on July 4th 1776 with the
[54:35.940 --> 54:39.920]  Declaration of Independence, we need a new Declaration of Independence against this tyranny
[54:39.920 --> 54:44.320]  but only you can be the standard bearers and carry this message if you choose to be free,
[54:44.320 --> 54:45.320]  God bless and good luck.
[54:45.320 --> 54:54.600]  The first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray
[54:54.600 --> 55:01.480]  bottle, the next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing survival shield X2 spray,
[55:01.480 --> 55:05.480]  the great part about the X2 spray is it's great on the go, when you've got it in the
[55:05.480 --> 55:10.200]  dropper it's great at your house, it's great at work but this is great for the car, it's
[55:10.200 --> 55:15.600]  great to keep with you and again it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects
[55:15.600 --> 55:20.800]  of iodine not to just ingest it into the stomach, we're really excited about it, it's 33% off
[55:20.800 --> 55:25.680]  out of the gates, it was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that
[55:25.680 --> 55:29.640]  had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes
[55:29.640 --> 55:34.480]  it and delivers it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way, get your survival
[55:34.480 --> 55:40.960]  shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and experience the power
[55:40.960 --> 55:47.140]  of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[55:47.140 --> 55:54.080]  This is the end my friends, my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end of
[55:54.080 --> 56:02.000]  everything that stands the end, the safety, the delusion, it's all over ladies and gentlemen
[56:02.000 --> 56:08.800]  because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and partying and living like children
[56:08.800 --> 56:15.240]  ever growing up, ever caring about other people, this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[56:15.240 --> 56:19.360]  just like the history book show was just like the bible states, every time Israel became
[56:19.360 --> 56:24.600]  corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity because their
[56:24.600 --> 56:31.320]  people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved,
[56:31.320 --> 56:37.000]  we are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.920]  absolute bondage, info wars has decided to fight for freedom, info wars has had great
[56:42.920 --> 56:49.560]  victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[56:49.560 --> 57:05.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:05.760 --> 57:09.200]  Alright folks Alex Jones is coming up in the next segment, I want to play some videos
[57:09.200 --> 57:13.320]  here before we get to the rest of the news and then I'm hoping we hear from our crew
[57:13.320 --> 57:19.680]  boots on the ground from ChazzChop and then also your phone calls in the third hour, I
[57:19.680 --> 57:27.560]  want to dedicate the entire third hour to your phone calls.
[57:27.560 --> 57:35.920]  Let me just roll some of this b-roll, first let's go to the one in the audio, in clip
[57:35.920 --> 57:46.560]  7 I assume we have this censored guys, so folks this is sad but the media is bringing
[57:46.560 --> 57:55.240]  back racism and it's specifically being aimed and targeted against white people and so this
[57:55.240 --> 58:01.120]  weekend alone you had a series of hate crime attacks if you believe in that notion when
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.720]  it comes to race and skin color against white people, now I want to just show an example
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.000]  of these one with audio and then we'll just read the b-roll but listen this is a young
[58:11.000 --> 58:17.960]  black guy who is either watching these kids or somehow with these kids and there's one
[58:17.960 --> 58:22.600]  white kid and three young black kids and then one older kid recording encouraging the black
[58:22.600 --> 58:39.160]  kids to beat up the white kid and steal his bike, here's the video, steal his bike kicking
[58:39.160 --> 58:48.920]  him on the head on the ground stomping on him and it's all being encouraged by the guy
[58:48.920 --> 59:04.360]  who's filming it who's obviously an older kid and the guy's just standing there watching
[59:04.360 --> 59:12.160]  it encouraging it, it's all been justified and it's all been instigated by the media,
[59:12.160 --> 59:18.440]  alright guys go ahead and pull it down, I don't take pleasure watching this or reporting
[59:18.440 --> 59:23.360]  this to you folks, I don't like getting involved with all the race baiting and all the division
[59:23.360 --> 59:28.080]  but they're never going to show you this on the mainstream news because this is the product
[59:28.080 --> 59:32.440]  of the mainstream news, let's just go ahead and roll some of this other stuff, let's go
[59:32.440 --> 59:42.880]  just roll clip one, this was at a Maryland pier and you had a bunch of people out there
[59:42.880 --> 59:48.520]  BLM protesters for George Floyd and then all of a sudden the crowd just decided to aim
[59:48.520 --> 59:53.160]  itself against whatever white people they could find and so if God forbid you were
[59:53.160 --> 59:59.600]  one of the white people in this crowd of mostly black people you got targeted for getting
[59:59.600 --> 1:00:04.880]  your ass beat and so this is all on footage here and you can tell not everybody wants
[1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:08.600]  to get involved, in fact a lot of the people are like hey don't do this stuff man we're
[1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:15.280]  not out here to be racist but just like what happens with every other mob the most vitriolic
[1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:21.880]  and violent ones always seem to take the lead and so there you go there's another victim
[1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:30.480]  of racism, the white guy gets targeted for being white, okay so again that was from this
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:39.800]  weekend, let's see what else do we have here, what is clip 2 guys I don't even know, doesn't
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:48.440]  seem, oh oh yeah let's roll clip 2 here's a nice here's a here's a nice young man who
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:52.840]  sees a 92 year old white woman walking down the street a black young black kid punches
[1:00:52.840 --> 1:01:00.440]  her in the face and then she falls over this happened in New York this weekend, now it's
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:06.440]  not the media going to show you that, wonder why he did that, why do you think he punched
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:11.720]  that old white lady, I'm sure it wasn't because she was white, he probably just didn't like
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:22.080]  her pink sweater, he thought oh oh he thought she was with the rival gang oh easy mistake
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:25.360]  easy mistake to make that 92 year old white woman she could have been with that rival
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:29.640]  gang and so he punched her in the face knocked her over that's nice, guys go ahead and just
[1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:35.200]  roll clip 3 as we go out, heck roll clip 5, you know this is just some of the peaceful
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:40.720]  protesting we're seeing from Black Lives Matter, very very peaceful, go ahead and roll clip
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:45.720]  5 guys let's get a little clip 5 in here, just show it a little here, oh oh this was
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:51.200]  the guy, oh oh this guy did not get treated too well when he went into Trump country as
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:02:03.480]  a liberal they kicked him out, globalists have gotten away with their russia gate hoax,
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:12.840]  their ukraine hoax, their covid-19 hoax and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020, we've
[1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:16.840]  got to ask ourselves what's coming next, well I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of
[1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:22.560]  big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war, it's going to be economic
[1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:28.760]  collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it, the globalists are attacking
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:33.400]  on every front, that's why now more than ever we have to realize they tried to censor
[1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:38.320]  employers off the air because they knew when they watched this whole situation that they
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:43.520]  didn't want the people's voice to still be on air but thanks to you and our crew we are
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:49.240]  still on air, so let's boost that transmission like the batman's signal now more than ever
[1:02:49.240 --> 1:03:19.160]  info wars dot com lives, this is the heart of 1776, it's also what happens when you
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:35.520]  listen to the radio host Alex Jones, info wars helped fuel the rumor that President
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:57.100]  Obama is an ISIS supporter, it's been a cozy relationship from the beginning, the post
[1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:05.560]  humanists built their worldwide architecture of control and surveillance in quasi-secret
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:10.720]  circumstances but now that they're going to implement the actual control grid and leave
[1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:16.920]  beta and go into operational they're out in the open, there's an article from the London
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:24.760]  Guardian linked to info wars dot com with an extensive report by RT where the top UN
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:32.780]  official over a major UN department admits that this is all just a dress rehearsal practicing
[1:04:32.780 --> 1:04:39.340]  clamping down on society and that the COVID response has been directed by the WHO and
[1:04:39.340 --> 1:04:44.820]  yes of course the response to saying America's racist and evil and taking control of police
[1:04:44.820 --> 1:04:51.260]  departments is also being directed by the UN, go read the interview in the London Guardian
[1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:56.380]  for yourself and that's what's so frustrating about this, Republicans on average barely
[1:04:56.380 --> 1:05:00.540]  know the three branches of government, Democrat voters can't find their errands with both
[1:05:00.540 --> 1:05:06.780]  hands and when you actually know the architecture of the planet, when I even talk to Congress
[1:05:06.780 --> 1:05:12.980]  people off record they can't believe I know all this, why wouldn't I know who rules the
[1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:18.180]  earth especially when you find out they're a bunch of murdering control freaks who are
[1:05:18.180 --> 1:05:22.900]  setting up a planetary government to carry out forced depopulation, dumbing down the
[1:05:22.900 --> 1:05:29.820]  breakdown of the family, their operating system is Satanism and pedophilia and they're now
[1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:35.100]  externalizing it all over the news all over TV saying Democrats kill babies as an act
[1:05:35.100 --> 1:05:40.180]  of power we enjoy it we love the devil, suddenly Satanists are coming out of one of their rocks
[1:05:40.180 --> 1:05:44.780]  all over the place, businesses in Austin are saying no Christians allowed we worship Satan
[1:05:44.780 --> 1:05:52.380]  I mean it's on folks, it's on but still people are fat dumb and happy we'll wait till the
[1:05:52.380 --> 1:05:56.820]  clear evidence of the depression hits, let me read over this article, UN official admits
[1:05:56.820 --> 1:06:01.980]  coronavirus black lives matter climate change agendas are inseparable, calls coronavirus
[1:06:01.980 --> 1:06:08.220]  pandemic a fire drill for what's coming, remember Bill Gates said that about a month
[1:06:08.220 --> 1:06:12.900]  and a half ago on co-bearer all these other globalists have said it, we said it first
[1:06:12.900 --> 1:06:17.140]  because we could see their pre-planning, word for word though we said it was a drill, now
[1:06:17.140 --> 1:06:22.060]  they admit it is, the global response and fallout from the coronavirus pandemic serves
[1:06:22.060 --> 1:06:28.140]  as a dress rehearsal for a worldwide climate catastrophe, the head of the UN Sustainable
[1:06:28.140 --> 1:06:33.100]  Business Agency has warned and again just like the WHO's over all your healthcare this
[1:06:33.100 --> 1:06:37.020]  is over what your business is allowed to do and what sustainability is, wonder why you
[1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:41.420]  got all those paper straws now, it's these folks, they don't care about China dumping
[1:06:41.420 --> 1:06:45.460]  90% of the waste in the ocean that's actually killing everything, they just don't want you
[1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:53.100]  to have plastic, Lice Kingo executive director of the UN Global Compact insisted in an interview
[1:06:53.100 --> 1:06:58.540]  with Guardian that there were very very clear connections linking the current health crisis
[1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:02.700]  climate change issues and the black lives matter protests that has spread across the
[1:07:02.700 --> 1:07:07.140]  globe, the coronavirus pandemic is quote just a fire drill for what's coming, she told
[1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:12.060]  the news outlet, government actions purportedly taking to stop the spread of the virus have
[1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:17.060]  crippled economies across the globe and it's been attributed to widespread social unrest
[1:07:17.060 --> 1:07:24.060]  making her warning particularly sobering, wrote the Guardian, according to the UN official
[1:07:24.060 --> 1:07:29.380]  who just always know what's coming because they're behind it, issues surrounding inequality
[1:07:29.380 --> 1:07:35.860]  are quote part of the sustainable development agenda, again they shut down the economy in
[1:07:35.860 --> 1:07:39.420]  the third world and first world create mass death and then they manage the crisis into
[1:07:39.420 --> 1:07:44.540]  the next leg, she added that their only way forward is to create a world that leaves no
[1:07:44.540 --> 1:07:48.860]  one behind when the UN again is literally exterminating people out of the planet for
[1:07:48.860 --> 1:07:54.100]  their land and running policies to kill them, Kingo also argued that the death in Minneapolis
[1:07:54.100 --> 1:07:59.260]  of George Floyd at the hands of police exposed a horrible racism, meanwhile the UN killed
[1:07:59.260 --> 1:08:03.780]  over a million people in Africa in Rwanda alone, in the world and that human rights
[1:08:03.780 --> 1:08:09.740]  were inseparable, I want to say something right now, black lives matter only matter if
[1:08:09.740 --> 1:08:14.580]  white people are involved, but when the UN is murdering people, most of the peacekeepers
[1:08:14.580 --> 1:08:19.620]  by the way are not white, it's wonderful and loving, this is sick, black lives matter
[1:08:19.620 --> 1:08:23.780]  only when white people are involved, but again she said George Floyd at the hands of police
[1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:28.420]  exposed horrible racism in the world and that human rights were inseparable from dealing
[1:08:28.420 --> 1:08:33.100]  with climate issues, she encouraged CEOs, that's run the UN, and business owners to
[1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:37.620]  become social activists, which you all see them doing in unison, claiming that young
[1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:42.100]  people would not want to work for them unless they understand social equality, it's actually
[1:08:42.100 --> 1:08:45.860]  the corporations making you understand the social equality, Tim Cook runs giant slave
[1:08:45.860 --> 1:08:50.460]  camps at Apple, but he tells you black lives matter need to overthrow the United States,
[1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:53.900]  although she didn't elaborate on exactly how black lives matter demonstrations relate
[1:08:53.900 --> 1:08:58.100]  to climate change, it appears that many activists have already made the connection, last week
[1:08:58.100 --> 1:09:03.380]  climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion targeted Cambridge University's analyzing
[1:09:03.380 --> 1:09:08.100]  college building and protesting against a memorial for alleged racist statistician Ronald
[1:09:08.100 --> 1:09:12.060]  Fisher, although hell is one of the most important figures of the 20th century, statistics,
[1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:18.060]  Fisher was an outspoken proponent of eugenics and even postulated that civilization fall
[1:09:18.060 --> 1:09:21.900]  because of people low genetic value have more children than people with high genetic value,
[1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:26.300]  but wait a minute, it's the actual eugenicists that are running this operation, but it's
[1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:29.980]  an even higher level eugenics where they actually target the smartest people and then believe
[1:09:29.980 --> 1:09:34.340]  they'll just call the dumb off once they've captured and taken control of the intelligent
[1:09:34.340 --> 1:09:38.260]  so that they can control the future, but first the globalists want to win that leg of the
[1:09:38.260 --> 1:09:42.780]  attack and I think one of my greatest contributions has been exposing that real paradigm, but
[1:09:42.780 --> 1:09:49.860]  here's the bottom line, there are huge articles up on infowars.com and newswars.com right now
[1:09:49.860 --> 1:09:54.900]  that detail what's really happening, 85% of independent US restaurants are going to close
[1:09:54.900 --> 1:09:59.780]  by the end of the year, the major restaurant association is saying that's the plan, but
[1:09:59.780 --> 1:10:06.020]  the big corporations, they all just get basically free loans and they are just stand by and
[1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:10.580]  then make you buy at their grocery stores, their restaurants, their facilities, but they're
[1:10:10.580 --> 1:10:13.580]  going to add social controls to what you can do.
[1:10:13.580 --> 1:10:18.340]  This is about knocking out not just the underground economy, but the middle class infrastructure
[1:10:18.340 --> 1:10:23.300]  which has been the main globalist goal all along, meanwhile they will ban the second
[1:10:23.300 --> 1:10:28.220]  amendment in all the blue zones, but then allow their operatives to operate above the
[1:10:28.220 --> 1:10:32.700]  law, another big article up on infowars.com.
[1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:39.620]  Photos confirmed Chas Warlord Raz Simone was running guns from the truck of his Tesla,
[1:10:39.620 --> 1:10:44.420]  but that's okay, illegally selling guns out of the back of the car so you can then set
[1:10:44.420 --> 1:10:48.700]  up checkpoints and enslave people and get extortion money is okay because it's actual
[1:10:48.700 --> 1:10:54.260]  racketeering, actual mafia, actual terrorism, but when good citizens come out in their neighborhoods
[1:10:54.260 --> 1:10:58.300]  and stop looting by simply being armed, they're terrorist on the news, you say well this doesn't
[1:10:58.300 --> 1:11:02.500]  make sense, there's a war on logic saying there's not two sexes, saying Trump can't
[1:11:02.500 --> 1:11:05.620]  have a rally, but Democrats can all have rallies.
[1:11:05.620 --> 1:11:11.140]  This system is run by twisted psychologists and psychiatrists and they understand that
[1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:14.820]  what they're pushing isn't logical for the general public, it's enslavement, so they
[1:11:14.820 --> 1:11:20.300]  are burning out your receptor sites, they are conditioning you to just see absolutely
[1:11:20.300 --> 1:11:26.780]  insane mad hat or tea party stuff, so you finally just get desensitized and go into
[1:11:26.780 --> 1:11:28.340]  learn helplessness.
[1:11:28.340 --> 1:11:32.140]  That's why you can't just tune out from it, it's designed to make you tune out.
[1:11:32.140 --> 1:11:37.020]  Then the weight crushes you mentally and spiritually and culturally, you must energize against
[1:11:37.020 --> 1:11:42.740]  the threat, use it as psychological and psychic weight that you then push and then like a
[1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:47.940]  crossfitter or somebody that exercises a lot, you get stronger, not weaker.
[1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:50.540]  That's what this is all about.
[1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:55.740]  You adapt and you overcome, you don't adapt by submitting, because in the end game, this
[1:11:55.740 --> 1:11:59.980]  is not where you're just going along to get along, like Confucius said, like grass in
[1:11:59.980 --> 1:12:05.860]  the wind, this is stopping the grass all being burned down and completely destroyed.
[1:12:05.860 --> 1:12:12.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, think about what we just covered, the UN head official out of UNESCO
[1:12:12.860 --> 1:12:17.460]  setting the policies worldwide for businesses under sustainability that really just mean
[1:12:17.460 --> 1:12:21.740]  feudalism and that they control what you can do, is saying that this is about teaching
[1:12:21.740 --> 1:12:25.300]  you to have less because the third world doesn't have anything.
[1:12:25.300 --> 1:12:30.660]  When in truth, when you shut off the first world's economy, it destroys the third world.
[1:12:30.660 --> 1:12:34.380]  But now that the populations are dying in mass in the third world, 100 plus million
[1:12:34.380 --> 1:12:39.380]  starving us now, according to UN themselves, now they're going to open the borders up more
[1:12:39.380 --> 1:12:42.620]  and hit us with these giant starving third world populations and then, quote, make us
[1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:48.020]  take care of the very people they just disenfranchised and all of it built on a Bill and Melinda
[1:12:48.020 --> 1:12:54.580]  Gates, NGO, WHO, COVID-19 galactic sized fruit.
[1:12:54.580 --> 1:12:59.500]  House flies defecate every four to five minutes, spreading diseases and germs.

[1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:26.340]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:31.500]  And so, populist movements are throwing the globalist out of their countries.
[1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:35.980]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people
[1:13:35.980 --> 1:13:41.340]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[1:13:41.340 --> 1:13:43.300]  essential services.
[1:13:43.300 --> 1:13:48.460]  This is an attempt to have society collapse and the globalist, as they've done in the
[1:13:48.460 --> 1:13:51.220]  third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:56.980]  He must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the EU openly saying defund
[1:13:56.980 --> 1:13:57.980]  the police.
[1:13:57.980 --> 1:13:59.460]  The police have a lot of problems.
[1:13:59.460 --> 1:14:00.860]  We all have a lot of problems.
[1:14:00.860 --> 1:14:03.580]  This is our government and our localist tabulary.
[1:14:03.580 --> 1:14:08.260]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country, they are going to put in a real
[1:14:08.260 --> 1:14:10.540]  police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:14.340]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:16.460]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[1:14:16.460 --> 1:14:23.300]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed, infowars.com.
[1:14:23.300 --> 1:14:27.900]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true
[1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:29.380]  atomic iodine.
[1:14:29.380 --> 1:14:33.620]  Scientists have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[1:14:33.620 --> 1:14:35.860]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[1:14:35.860 --> 1:14:37.820]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:42.460]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[1:14:42.460 --> 1:14:46.740]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[1:14:46.740 --> 1:14:50.940]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[1:14:50.940 --> 1:14:53.260]  of true nascent iodine working for my body.
[1:14:53.260 --> 1:14:54.980]  I can personally feel the difference.
[1:14:54.980 --> 1:14:59.380]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy
[1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:03.420]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels and healthy cognitive function.
[1:15:03.420 --> 1:15:07.980]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.

[1:15:18.860 --> 1:15:20.380]  our new limited first shipment.
[1:15:20.380 --> 1:15:26.220]  That's infowarsstore.com.
[1:15:26.220 --> 1:15:44.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:49.260]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[1:15:49.260 --> 1:15:51.020]  Do you want to stop tyranny?
[1:15:51.020 --> 1:16:02.060]  Well so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:16:02.060 --> 1:16:07.580]  I know Roger Stone personally, I've known him for many years and I was there when WikiLeaks
[1:16:07.580 --> 1:16:13.460]  refused to talk to him when he tried to get messages to Julian Assange through Randy
[1:16:13.460 --> 1:16:22.620]  Creditco and now because he helped get President Trump elected three and a half years ago,
[1:16:22.620 --> 1:16:29.220]  he is facing a prison sentence for thought crime and has been ordered by the corrupt
[1:16:29.220 --> 1:16:37.780]  evil judge, Judge Amy Berman Jackson in DC, the swamp creature to a quote COVID infested
[1:16:37.780 --> 1:16:43.580]  prison when Harvey Weinstein, always other people convicted of rape have been let out
[1:16:43.580 --> 1:16:46.660]  of jail because of COVID-19.
[1:16:46.660 --> 1:16:49.500]  Now again, we know COVID-19 is massively exaggerated.
[1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:53.940]  We know that if you have your zinc and you have your vitamin D3 and you have things that's
[1:16:53.940 --> 1:16:58.180]  very hard to get it, but it is a bad pneumonia and the point is they're letting hardened
[1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:04.580]  criminals out of jail and sending Roger Stone is almost 70 and does have some health issues
[1:17:04.580 --> 1:17:05.580]  into prison.
[1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:12.260]  And on top of the fact that he's done nothing wrong shows you the total and complete hypocrisy.
[1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:16.980]  We need attention on this very, very important story.
[1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:23.540]  So from now until the day he reports to prison, the next 15 days we'll have a daily countdown
[1:17:23.540 --> 1:17:28.180]  at newswars.com and infowars.com and articles on the site explaining what's happening because
[1:17:28.180 --> 1:17:31.380]  they can do this to him, they can do it to anybody.
[1:17:31.380 --> 1:17:36.420]  We need him to be pardoned or he needs clemency now and the illegal orders of the judge silencing
[1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:38.180]  him need to stop.
[1:17:38.180 --> 1:17:40.540]  We need to say no political prisoners in America.
[1:17:40.540 --> 1:17:43.220]  Oh, abolish the police, the Democrats say.
[1:17:43.220 --> 1:17:44.740]  They just mean have the UN take it over.
[1:17:44.740 --> 1:17:49.940]  But be sure and throw everybody else in prison who's only stood up for this country.
[1:17:49.940 --> 1:17:50.940]  That's his only crime.
[1:17:50.940 --> 1:17:55.780]  15 days countdown to the deep state death sentence unless President Trump intervenes
[1:17:55.780 --> 1:18:02.300]  with a pardon or if he commutes the sentence of Roger Stone, he will be sent to COVID-19
[1:18:02.300 --> 1:18:07.780]  if I said prison at a 67 where they hope he will die.
[1:18:07.780 --> 1:18:10.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, we need to stand up for Roger.
[1:18:10.780 --> 1:18:12.100]  We just stand up for Julian Assange.
[1:18:12.100 --> 1:18:15.300]  We just stand up for so many other political prisoners.
[1:18:15.300 --> 1:18:18.460]  Once they shut down what's left of the media under this total censorship, they're going
[1:18:18.460 --> 1:18:19.460]  to come after everybody.
[1:18:19.460 --> 1:18:24.780]  Tucker Carlson was absolutely right when he said when the George Soros funded BLM is
[1:18:24.780 --> 1:18:28.380]  done overthrowing the police, they're going to come for all of us next.
[1:18:28.380 --> 1:18:31.300]  Not the black people, but the globalists that control it.
[1:18:31.300 --> 1:18:32.300]  That's what this is.
[1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:33.300]  It's a takeover.
[1:18:33.300 --> 1:18:38.940]  The UN has even come out and admitted that they're behind BLM and behind the COVID hoax.
[1:18:38.940 --> 1:18:41.100]  It's absolutely incredible.
[1:18:41.100 --> 1:18:43.380]  And again, not that the virus isn't real.
[1:18:43.380 --> 1:18:48.060]  The response is a hoax clamping down on our freedoms, staying six feet apart.
[1:18:48.060 --> 1:18:51.820]  All of this is designed to destroy the economy that the UN head official gave an interview
[1:18:51.820 --> 1:18:53.780]  to the Guardian and admitted it.
[1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:55.860]  They said it's about lowering our carbon footprint.
[1:18:55.860 --> 1:18:56.860]  It's incredible.
[1:18:56.860 --> 1:19:04.300]  But again, Roger Stone, 15 days, 15 days until he faces that potential death sentence.
[1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:07.860]  We will continue to have the countdown here every day on the Alex Jones show.
[1:19:07.860 --> 1:19:14.060]  All right, we'll be hearing again from Alex coming up in the next segment.
[1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:20.060]  Want to remind folks about the specials at infowarstore.com, 60% off some of the top-selling
[1:19:20.060 --> 1:19:26.460]  top-rated supplements at infowarstore.com, like the real red pill and the real red pill

[1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:36.460]  Don't forget about the t-shirts, don't forget about the emergency food supplies, don't forget
[1:19:36.460 --> 1:19:40.780]  about the water filters, the air filters, the shower filters.
[1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:45.780]  It's all available at infowarstore.com and it's your support at infowarstore.com that
[1:19:45.780 --> 1:19:56.260]  keeps us on air because you know that television news is untrustable.
[1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:02.980]  And you know, really at this point, most television news is completely, most mainstream
[1:20:02.980 --> 1:20:07.340]  news is just completely irredeemable, folks, what they've done.
[1:20:07.340 --> 1:20:14.540]  And so that's why it's so important to support infowarstore.com as we are the most attacked
[1:20:14.540 --> 1:20:19.260]  and villainized by the establishment in the news media.
[1:20:19.260 --> 1:20:31.580]  That's because we are the biggest stop gap in the way of total media control over the
[1:20:31.580 --> 1:20:39.900]  narrative and over reality, which they have pretty strong control over folks.
[1:20:39.900 --> 1:20:44.860]  And the censorship that we've endured has not helped.
[1:20:44.860 --> 1:20:48.580]  And so we'll get to that in a second.
[1:20:48.580 --> 1:20:54.220]  And Alex Jones is coming back, but you know, I can't help but laugh.
[1:20:54.220 --> 1:20:59.060]  This is a real story from the New York Times today.
[1:20:59.060 --> 1:21:00.060]  Try to bear with me.
[1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:07.660]  See if you can wrap your mind around this headline, flushing the toilet may fling coronavirus
[1:21:07.660 --> 1:21:17.580]  aerosols all over.
[1:21:17.580 --> 1:21:23.620]  Here's one more behavior to be hyper aware of in order to prevent coronavirus transmission.
[1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:26.460]  What to do after you use the toilet?
[1:21:26.460 --> 1:21:29.500]  Scientists have found that in addition to clearing out whatever business you've left
[1:21:29.500 --> 1:21:40.620]  behind, flushing a toilet can generate a cloud of aerosol droplets that rises nearly 3 feet.
[1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:45.060]  These droplets may linger in the air long enough to be inhaled by a shared toilet's next user
[1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:51.100]  or land on surfaces in the bathroom.
[1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:53.580]  This toilet plume isn't just gross.
[1:21:53.580 --> 1:21:58.780]  In simulations, it can carry infectious coronavirus particles that are already present in the
[1:21:58.780 --> 1:22:03.820]  surrounding air or recently shed in a person's stool.
[1:22:03.820 --> 1:22:07.740]  New York Times literally writing about poop.
[1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:11.620]  The research published Tuesday in the journal Physics of Fluids adds to growing evidence
[1:22:11.620 --> 1:22:15.980]  that the coronavirus can be passed not only through respiratory droplets but through virus
[1:22:15.980 --> 1:22:23.020]  laden feces too.
[1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:26.580]  What will they do next?
[1:22:26.580 --> 1:22:27.580]  What will they do next?
[1:22:27.580 --> 1:22:32.220]  The funny thing about this, I remember reading, this is so long ago, I remember reading a
[1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:40.580]  story about this, how basically feces droplets end up all over in the bathroom and that's
[1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:43.580]  why you shouldn't leave your toothbrush out.
[1:22:43.580 --> 1:22:48.900]  But this is next level, so hey, you know what?
[1:22:48.900 --> 1:22:55.980]  We should probably just ban going to the bathroom altogether.
[1:22:55.980 --> 1:22:57.900]  I think that's the only answer.
[1:22:57.900 --> 1:23:03.860]  Or maybe the only safe place to go to the bathroom is out in the woods and so once you
[1:23:03.860 --> 1:23:10.420]  finish your business, you just shovel some dirt over it because if you go to the bathroom
[1:23:10.420 --> 1:23:14.820]  and you use modern day plumbing, well, that's probably white privilege but you're also spreading
[1:23:14.820 --> 1:23:19.940]  COVID.
[1:23:19.940 --> 1:23:26.540]  And you know, if you dare, if you dare fart ever, you're probably spreading COVID.
[1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:28.020]  So think about that now.
[1:23:28.020 --> 1:23:33.380]  We're talking about rectum, rectal transmission of COVID now.
[1:23:33.380 --> 1:23:38.460]  We're talking about fart transplants.
[1:23:38.460 --> 1:23:47.260]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the New York Times is warning you not to flush your toilet because
[1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:56.420]  you could be getting some feces droplets that contain COVID.
[1:23:56.420 --> 1:24:02.180]  If this isn't the clown world, I really don't know what is.
[1:24:02.180 --> 1:24:06.060]  Coming back on the other side, Alex Jones is going to be breaking down a powerful Tucker
[1:24:06.060 --> 1:24:14.060]  Carlson segment but folks, the left is out of control.
[1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:18.260]  It's time to start preparing yourselves, whatever that means.
[1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:21.300]  Getting on your knees and praying to God, getting more guns, getting emergency food.
[1:24:21.300 --> 1:24:22.300]  Now's the time.
[1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:25.860]  Hello, Rob Do here with infowarrestore.com and I've got some good news and some bad

[1:25:35.100 --> 1:25:41.900]  Others have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep

[1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:26.980]  What info wars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your
[1:26:26.980 --> 1:26:32.460]  word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:39.780]  This is the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being established
[1:26:39.780 --> 1:26:43.580]  with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[1:26:43.580 --> 1:26:47.700]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[1:26:47.700 --> 1:26:51.660]  You must decide which side you're on.
[1:26:51.660 --> 1:26:56.260]  Living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you
[1:26:56.260 --> 1:26:59.700]  into misery, destruction and finally death.
[1:26:59.700 --> 1:27:05.060]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:07.780]  The delusions must end now.
[1:27:07.780 --> 1:27:13.140]  Info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:16.340]  Most people that are aware of the new order decide to join it out of fear.
[1:27:16.340 --> 1:27:18.260]  They are truly fools.
[1:27:18.260 --> 1:27:25.100]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[1:27:25.100 --> 1:27:52.260]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:52.260 --> 1:27:56.180]  Black Lives Matter is now more popular than the president of the United States and not
[1:27:56.180 --> 1:28:00.060]  slightly more popular than the president, much more popular.
[1:28:00.060 --> 1:28:02.620]  Dr. Carlson is right.
[1:28:02.620 --> 1:28:08.580]  Black Lives Matter has always been a political party openly funded by George Soros and the
[1:28:08.580 --> 1:28:09.580]  Democratic Party.
[1:28:09.580 --> 1:28:14.620]  That's why the majority of the money raised by Black Lives Matter and George Floyd is
[1:28:14.620 --> 1:28:19.780]  being directed to the Democratic Party publicly as campaign donations.
[1:28:19.780 --> 1:28:25.420]  It's because we've put up with the criminal activity of the DNC, Soros and others for
[1:28:25.420 --> 1:28:26.980]  decades.
[1:28:26.980 --> 1:28:30.340]  They act above the law.
[1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:36.180]  And then they have all the Republican establishment types come out and endorse Black Lives Matter
[1:28:36.180 --> 1:28:42.100]  and the statistically almost non-existent event of a police officer wrongly shooting
[1:28:42.100 --> 1:28:43.500]  and killing a black man.
[1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:46.980]  Again, happens about 14 times a year on average.
[1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:53.060]  It's in the FBI's own statistics, but just like COVID-19, it is a giant hoax.
[1:28:53.060 --> 1:28:57.940]  And so the entire political agenda of BLM, Planned Parenthood, exterminating mainly
[1:28:57.940 --> 1:29:05.020]  black people, open borders, globalism, an end of the nuclear family, these are all official
[1:29:05.020 --> 1:29:12.180]  Black Lives Matter policies, abolishing the police, they mean having the UN take it over.
[1:29:12.180 --> 1:29:20.140]  These are all globalist UN New World Order operations, and the UN head of sustainability
[1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:23.420]  has even come out and said they're directing it.
[1:29:23.420 --> 1:29:24.860]  And they're directing COVID.
[1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:27.820]  So yes, Tucker Carlson's right.
[1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:30.060]  Black Lives Matter is a political party.
[1:29:30.060 --> 1:29:34.660]  It's a political party of the UN and the globalist and their client party, the Democrats, just
[1:29:34.660 --> 1:29:40.620]  like their client party in England, Labor, that are overthrowing the nation state and
[1:29:40.620 --> 1:29:45.740]  exacerbating racial tensions and blaming local government when things go wrong, knowing
[1:29:45.740 --> 1:29:48.180]  all the police have body cams.
[1:29:48.180 --> 1:29:52.220]  And every few weeks or so, there's going to be a tragic event.
[1:29:52.220 --> 1:29:57.260]  They can then blow that up, project that onto anybody that's white, and the average white
[1:29:57.260 --> 1:30:02.180]  American goes, well, I'm not racist, sure, I'll say Black Lives Matter.
[1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:03.180]  Not all lives matter.
[1:30:03.180 --> 1:30:08.980]  I'll say that Black Lives Matter, the political party has total power and control.
[1:30:08.980 --> 1:30:11.980]  I won't question anything it says.
[1:30:11.980 --> 1:30:16.660]  So it's really megacorporations that run slave camps around the country and around the world,
[1:30:16.660 --> 1:30:21.780]  like Nike and Apple and all the rest of it, deflecting away from the fact that they're
[1:30:21.780 --> 1:30:24.860]  total tyrants and getting us all to fight with each other.
[1:30:24.860 --> 1:30:27.380]  So here's part of Tucker Carlson's powerful report.
[1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:30.660]  The full report's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:30:30.660 --> 1:30:35.340]  We'll go back to Owen Shroyer and the great crew and all the work they're doing, but this
[1:30:35.340 --> 1:30:36.340]  is fundamental.
[1:30:36.340 --> 1:30:40.980]  It's not just a political party that's got a almost 70% approval rating.
[1:30:40.980 --> 1:30:47.500]  It is a movement, a globalist system to destroy our country and to make you swear allegiance
[1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:50.780]  to it and even get on your knees or your belly.
[1:30:50.780 --> 1:30:51.780]  It's called slavery.
[1:30:51.780 --> 1:30:54.860]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[1:30:54.860 --> 1:30:58.380]  Here's some bracing news we never expected to report.
[1:30:58.380 --> 1:31:02.300]  Black Lives Matter is now more popular than the president of the United States and not
[1:31:02.300 --> 1:31:06.300]  slightly more popular than the president, much more popular.
[1:31:06.300 --> 1:31:12.140]  A survey this week by Rasmussen, a right-leaning pollster, found that 62% of likely voters
[1:31:12.140 --> 1:31:15.460]  now have a favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter.
[1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:19.420]  The same time Rasmussen found that Donald Trump's approval rating was 43%.
[1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:20.940]  That's almost 20 points lower.
[1:31:20.940 --> 1:31:22.900]  And by the way, Trump was not alone.
[1:31:22.900 --> 1:31:26.660]  Black Lives Matter is far more popular than Joe Biden is, too.
[1:31:26.660 --> 1:31:30.300]  It's more popular than America's religious institutions, all of them.
[1:31:30.300 --> 1:31:33.900]  It's more popular than the media, the Congress, and big business.
[1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:39.140]  Black Matter is more popular by double digits than both the Democratic and the Republican
[1:31:39.140 --> 1:31:40.140]  parties.
[1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:42.340]  It's almost as popular as the U.S. military.
[1:31:42.340 --> 1:31:45.260]  It's much more popular than the Pope.
[1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:49.620]  The numbers are astounding, but the polls are not the only measure of it.
[1:31:49.620 --> 1:31:53.380]  Here's a Black Lives Matter rally from over the weekend in New York.
[1:31:53.380 --> 1:31:54.980]  Look at that picture.
[1:31:54.980 --> 1:31:57.580]  That is an ocean of people.
[1:31:57.580 --> 1:32:00.940]  Act yourself the last time you saw a candidate for office who was able to draw a crowd like
[1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:01.940]  that.
[1:32:01.940 --> 1:32:06.260]  The media and their relentlessly fawning coverage usually describe Black Lives Matter as an
[1:32:06.260 --> 1:32:09.460]  activist group or a protest movement.
[1:32:09.460 --> 1:32:11.380]  But that's deception by understatement.
[1:32:11.380 --> 1:32:14.420]  Black Lives Matter is not a collection of marchers with signs.
[1:32:14.420 --> 1:32:18.260]  It's not a conventional political lobby like Planned Parenthood or the NRA.
[1:32:18.260 --> 1:32:21.980]  It's not pressuring Congress to pass some narrow new set of laws.
[1:32:21.980 --> 1:32:24.980]  Black Lives Matter is far more ambitious than that.
[1:32:24.980 --> 1:32:28.580]  It is working to remake the country and then to control it.
[1:32:28.580 --> 1:32:30.220]  It's a political party.
[1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:34.100]  As of tonight, Black Lives Matter may be the single most powerful political party in the
[1:32:34.100 --> 1:32:35.460]  United States.
[1:32:35.460 --> 1:32:39.220]  Nobody says that out loud, but politicians understand it perfectly well.
[1:32:39.220 --> 1:32:41.100]  Nothing else, they understand power.
[1:32:41.100 --> 1:32:43.100]  They can smell it at great distances.
[1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:47.300]  And that's why they're lining up to bow before Black Lives Matter.
[1:32:47.300 --> 1:32:54.060]  You can't really reform a department that is rotten to the root.
[1:32:54.060 --> 1:32:59.620]  We've heard our people cry out, I can't breathe.
[1:32:59.620 --> 1:33:03.220]  We've heard our people speak out, Black Lives Matter.
[1:33:03.220 --> 1:33:08.780]  This is a systemic problem that requires a comprehensive solution.
[1:33:08.780 --> 1:33:13.220]  And what I would say is that there is a legitimacy to this anger.
[1:33:13.220 --> 1:33:16.620]  There's a legitimacy to this outrage.
[1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:19.300]  None of what you just saw is a stretch for Democrats.
[1:33:19.300 --> 1:33:23.020]  They believe their long-term goals align with those of Black Lives Matter.
[1:33:23.020 --> 1:33:26.860]  And in fact, at times, the group functions as an arm of the Democratic Party.
[1:33:26.860 --> 1:33:30.860]  More telling, though, and more ominous is the response from many Republicans.
[1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:35.180]  They've been happy to go along as well, or in Mitt Romney's case, even mouth the same
[1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:36.180]  slogans.
[1:33:36.180 --> 1:33:41.860]  No way to end violence and brutality, and to make sure that people understand the Black
[1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:44.780]  Lives Matter.
[1:33:44.780 --> 1:33:49.020]  That was the former Republican nominee for president, let that sink in.
[1:33:49.020 --> 1:33:53.580]  If there was ever an indicator of how powerful Black Lives Matter has become, you just saw
[1:33:53.580 --> 1:33:54.580]  it.
[1:33:54.580 --> 1:33:57.820]  Republican leaders brag about their strong conservative convictions, but mostly they
[1:33:57.820 --> 1:34:00.540]  just want to be on the winning team, whatever that is.
[1:34:00.540 --> 1:34:02.740]  That's why they pause before offending China.
[1:34:02.740 --> 1:34:06.420]  It's why when Black Lives Matter tells them to take a knee, they do.
[1:34:06.420 --> 1:34:09.060]  It's all pretty strange when you think about it.
[1:34:09.060 --> 1:34:14.420]  If the leaders of Black Lives Matter are political actors, and they are, then by definition,
[1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:18.620]  you're allowed to have any opinion you want to have about them.
[1:34:18.620 --> 1:34:22.300]  Black Lives Matter wants to run the country, therefore you can freely criticize Black Lives
[1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:23.300]  Matter.
[1:34:23.300 --> 1:34:27.180]  Those are the rules of our system, but not anymore.
[1:34:27.180 --> 1:34:30.820]  Imagine a world where you are punished for questioning the behavior of the president,
[1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:32.380]  or for insulting your local mayor.
[1:34:32.380 --> 1:34:37.020]  You probably can't imagine that, it's too bizarre, it's un-American, but that's where
[1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:38.340]  we are right now.
[1:34:38.340 --> 1:34:43.380]  Black Lives Matter has changed the rules, and here's their first new rule, no criticizing
[1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:44.780]  Black Lives Matter.
[1:34:44.780 --> 1:34:49.500]  You can be fired from your job if you disobey, many Americans have been.
[1:34:49.500 --> 1:34:53.140]  On Friday, for example, the principal of a public school in Windsor, Vermont was dismissed
[1:34:53.140 --> 1:34:57.420]  from her job for posting the following words on her personal Facebook page, quote,
[1:34:57.420 --> 1:35:02.180]  While I understand the urgency to feel compelled to advocate for Black Lives, what about our
[1:35:02.180 --> 1:35:03.860]  fellow law enforcement?
[1:35:03.860 --> 1:35:08.660]  Just because I don't walk around with a BLM sign should not mean I'm a racist.
[1:35:08.660 --> 1:35:09.660]  End quote.
[1:35:09.660 --> 1:35:14.060]  Unfortunately, the principal's boss disagreed, the superintendent of Windsor schools described
[1:35:14.060 --> 1:35:18.020]  the quote you just heard as, quote, outright racist.
[1:35:18.020 --> 1:35:21.700]  Windsor, Vermont, by the way, is more than 97% white.
[1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:25.420]  Also on Friday, an economist called Harold Eulig lost his job at the Federal Reserve
[1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:30.220]  Bank of Chicago for daring to offer even milder criticism than that.
[1:35:30.220 --> 1:35:34.780]  On Twitter, Eulig noted that Black Lives Matter had, quote, just torpedoed itself with its
[1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:38.180]  full-fledged support of hashtag defund the police.
[1:35:38.180 --> 1:35:42.660]  Now is the time, Eulig noted, quote, for sensible adults to enter back into the room
[1:35:42.660 --> 1:35:46.180]  and have serious, earnest, respectful conversations about it all.
[1:36:12.660 --> 1:36:17.220]  Chop for short, which stands for the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or the Capitol Hill
[1:36:17.220 --> 1:36:19.900]  Occupied Protest.
[1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:22.940]  But what is this new area and what does it stand for?
[1:36:22.940 --> 1:36:27.580]  This autonomous zone was taken by Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters in response to
[1:36:27.580 --> 1:36:32.180]  the anti-police movement sweeping America, with protesters taking over six blocks of
[1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:37.860]  downtown Seattle, including the East Precinct of the Seattle Police Department.
[1:36:37.860 --> 1:36:42.060]  Protesters then overtook the police department, ultimately pushing them out of the area,
[1:36:42.060 --> 1:36:51.820]  declaring it a cop-free zone, and naming it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.
[1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:56.460]  The citizens share that this is an autonomous territory outside of the U.S. and have attempted
[1:36:56.460 --> 1:37:02.820]  to create their own socialist utopia, complete with free food, clothes, a farm, and most importantly,
[1:37:02.820 --> 1:37:04.220]  no police.
[1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:07.420]  But what is life like inside of this zone and how has this week-long experience been
[1:37:07.420 --> 1:37:22.340]  resolved?
[1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:24.820]  United States is not communist China.
[1:37:24.820 --> 1:37:27.740]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[1:37:27.740 --> 1:37:29.620]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:37:29.620 --> 1:37:32.820]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[1:37:32.820 --> 1:37:39.020]  But all of the news, we see the UN, billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[1:37:39.020 --> 1:37:42.140]  praising communist China for their response.
[1:37:42.140 --> 1:37:46.460]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and asks
[1:37:46.460 --> 1:37:49.540]  robots controlling people, well then gee, we've got to do that.
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:53.660]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll arrest you if you
[1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:55.380]  say Chinese virus.
[1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:58.700]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:03.860]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[1:38:03.860 --> 1:38:07.820]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[1:38:07.820 --> 1:38:08.940]  power grab.
[1:38:08.940 --> 1:38:13.260]  The resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:17.300]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors, throats, and then we'll be able to defeat
[1:38:17.300 --> 1:38:20.660]  their operation that much quicker.
[1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:24.700]  Aerodyne technology delivery system.
[1:38:24.700 --> 1:38:30.500]  The first of its kind, pure nascent atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray
[1:38:30.500 --> 1:38:31.500]  bottle.
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:37.340]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing survival shield X2 spray.
[1:38:37.340 --> 1:38:40.420]  The great part about the X2 spray is it's great on the go.
[1:38:40.420 --> 1:38:44.580]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's great at work, but this
[1:38:44.580 --> 1:38:49.140]  is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the
[1:38:49.140 --> 1:38:54.020]  throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[1:38:54.020 --> 1:38:57.700]  We're really excited about it, it's 33% off out of the gates.
[1:38:57.700 --> 1:39:02.180]  It was listeners idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:06.220]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[1:39:06.220 --> 1:39:09.700]  it to the body in a new and in some ways even better way.
[1:39:09.700 --> 1:39:15.940]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[1:39:15.940 --> 1:39:20.700]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:26.500]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, great suppliers, you can now say four weeks on average
[1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:30.020]  for storable food, it's the highest quality that got it.
[1:39:30.020 --> 1:39:34.020]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service, get some
[1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:36.220]  air before you get sucked back down.
[1:39:36.220 --> 1:39:38.740]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[1:39:38.740 --> 1:39:45.140]  I have to now start going into defense posture, 80% offense but I've always been 100% offense
[1:39:45.140 --> 1:39:49.220]  trying to fully stop the globalists and we've given them a good run and I think down the
[1:39:49.220 --> 1:39:54.500]  road they'll be defeated but we're going to still go down the hard road now.
[1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:58.660]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down but we've mitigated some of this but
[1:39:58.660 --> 1:40:00.380]  it's still going to be bad in my view.
[1:40:00.380 --> 1:40:03.060]  You need to get high quality storeable food, it's something you need.
[1:40:03.060 --> 1:40:06.940]  We have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins
[1:40:06.940 --> 1:40:11.780]  so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarsstore.com and get your orders
[1:40:11.780 --> 1:40:16.340]  in now so you get it, so you have it, it's in great containers, high quality, last 25
[1:40:16.340 --> 1:40:20.100]  years get it while you can because if you think things are about to let up you ain't
[1:40:20.100 --> 1:40:22.780]  seen nothing yet.
[1:40:22.780 --> 1:40:25.620]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[1:40:25.620 --> 1:40:26.620]  Hello, can you hear me?
[1:40:26.620 --> 1:40:27.620]  I sure can sir, thank you.
[1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:33.020]  Hey Alex, before I start man I just wanted to talk to you bro and it's a pleasure to
[1:40:33.020 --> 1:40:34.300]  be talking right now with you man.
[1:40:34.300 --> 1:40:35.820]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you brother.
[1:40:35.820 --> 1:40:41.180]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut and I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver and two
[1:40:41.180 --> 1:40:46.740]  before I have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple
[1:40:46.740 --> 1:40:54.660]  of us, we are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull and
[1:40:54.660 --> 1:40:58.780]  Rolla and I have lost weight because I started drinking all that sugar and I just want to
[1:40:58.780 --> 1:40:59.780]  thank you for that man.
[1:40:59.780 --> 1:41:04.340]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder
[1:41:04.340 --> 1:41:08.060]  there is so this was designed by one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his
[1:41:08.060 --> 1:41:11.180]  name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for
[1:41:11.180 --> 1:41:15.020]  this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best, strongest but
[1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:18.940]  healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so that means
[1:41:18.940 --> 1:41:19.940]  a lot to me, thank you.
[1:41:19.940 --> 1:41:25.100]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[1:41:25.100 --> 1:41:46.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:46.100 --> 1:41:53.220]  Waging war on corruption, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host,
[1:41:53.220 --> 1:41:55.220]  Owen Troyer.
[1:41:55.220 --> 1:42:05.700]  Alright, it's 1047 local in the nation of Chazistan, Chapistan as it's 1247 here, central
[1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:10.820]  time in Austin, Texas so it's apparently bright and early, this is still a bright and
[1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:17.660]  early morning at 1047 as the people of Chaz are just starting to wrestle themselves out
[1:42:17.660 --> 1:42:24.500]  of their tents and sewer holes, we're joined by Rob who is out there boots on the ground,
[1:42:24.500 --> 1:42:31.740]  another night in Chaz, Chaz Chap Nation of Chaz, what is it like now?
[1:42:31.740 --> 1:42:35.900]  You've been there for three or four nights, you're out there on the ball field, it's totally
[1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:36.900]  empty though.
[1:42:36.900 --> 1:42:42.260]  Yeah man, we've been here for about, I think about three or four days somewhere around
[1:42:42.260 --> 1:42:45.940]  there, three days maybe, you know it's Chaz man, they don't even have clocks out here,
[1:42:45.940 --> 1:42:49.180]  you know when you're worried about time.
[1:42:49.180 --> 1:42:51.100]  Clocks are illegal in Chaz, it's like Neverland.
[1:42:51.100 --> 1:42:55.660]  It is man, yeah it's funny we bring up clocks because you know how flavor flavored, where's
[1:42:55.660 --> 1:43:01.700]  that big old clock, well actually we have white folks out here wearing art, it's art
[1:43:01.700 --> 1:43:05.940]  with a fist on there and it's like a necklace but it's a piece of art that hangs there on
[1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:12.060]  that high and that's there, that's the new acclaimed fame out here is art necklaces,
[1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:18.220]  I don't know, it's weird man, so is this just the eternal way of life now?
[1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:27.460]  Yeah dude, it's just you go with the flow man, you know, but there's seems to be some
[1:43:27.460 --> 1:43:32.820]  construction happening behind you, did somebody hijack a forklift or what is that?
[1:43:32.820 --> 1:43:39.780]  No dude, I think they're kind of shrinking the autonomous zone, they're having some kind
[1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:44.020]  of issues with the actual business owners and homeowners out here that they're starting
[1:43:44.020 --> 1:43:47.860]  to kind of come to some kind of agreement that they need to get to work, they need to
[1:43:47.860 --> 1:43:51.740]  get to, you know, they need to work and they need to get in and out of their garages, a
[1:43:51.740 --> 1:43:55.700]  lot of the garages are being blocked because of the autonomous zone being out in front
[1:43:55.700 --> 1:44:00.380]  of their entryways, so they're kind of bringing that back a little bit and I want to say they're
[1:44:00.380 --> 1:44:04.500]  probably scaling this down to maybe a four block radius and they're adding, right now
[1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:08.820]  they're adding cement blocks, so I think that they're starting to make more of the long
[1:44:08.820 --> 1:44:14.780]  term plans as far as the first couple days out here, it was really a tourist scene man
[1:44:14.780 --> 1:44:19.420]  and a lot of people didn't want to be interviewed and I could see why because they didn't know
[1:44:19.420 --> 1:44:23.660]  how to describe this, they were in their home city and this was like they were sad that
[1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:28.820]  people were excited that this was going on and a lot of them, I got a lady off camera
[1:44:28.820 --> 1:44:34.180]  and she was just devastated man, a lot of these people out here don't understand the
[1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:38.620]  other lives are actually impacting because they want to make this political statement.
[1:44:38.620 --> 1:44:44.500]  A lot of them say it's justified because of the racial, the systematic racism in this
[1:44:44.500 --> 1:44:48.900]  country, which by the way, as a black American, I have never felt oppressed, I have never
[1:44:48.900 --> 1:44:55.140]  felt like I haven't been able to achieve anything else anybody else hasn't achieved.
[1:44:55.140 --> 1:45:00.780]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's saying something like that, that's hate speech in jazz.
[1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:04.300]  That's why I'm kind of in the middle of the field today and not over by the precinct man
[1:45:04.300 --> 1:45:08.300]  because I'm tired of kind of holding my tongue out here, there's so many people who are brain
[1:45:08.300 --> 1:45:14.260]  washed and it's starting to affect me man, I don't, in Austin, you know, it's not as
[1:45:14.260 --> 1:45:17.540]  bad as out here, but when you're in here for a couple of days and you see that the mental
[1:45:17.540 --> 1:45:21.940]  issues a lot of these people have that aren't getting addressed, you see like this gentleman
[1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:26.620]  over here is one of the guys who actually yelled at the, he was yelling at the guy who
[1:45:26.620 --> 1:45:31.060]  was walking around in the Trump flag yesterday and he was calling the other guys suicidal
[1:45:31.060 --> 1:45:35.500]  and deranged and while he was foaming at the mouth saying he was suicidal and deranged.
[1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:39.180]  Yeah, when that guy, all that guy did, you guys have the footage, it's a banned out video,
[1:45:39.180 --> 1:45:43.220]  he was just walking around, he wasn't even saying much, if anything at all, just holding
[1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:44.460]  an American flag.
[1:45:44.460 --> 1:45:50.540]  Yeah, he didn't, and that was one of the arguments he made before he left and to tell you the
[1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:55.900]  truth, if we didn't have these cameras as close as we did and we weren't there the entire
[1:45:55.900 --> 1:45:58.820]  time, this guy might have not made it out of here.
[1:45:58.820 --> 1:46:02.460]  When he got to the end, you know, he was getting into an altercation with one of the black
[1:46:02.460 --> 1:46:06.020]  guys, well, one of the black guys who was getting into an altercation from is one of
[1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:10.620]  the people that we have on video sitting at the couch with guns.
[1:46:10.620 --> 1:46:17.500]  So he almost made it out and until that kind of altercation came and he actually, earlier
[1:46:17.500 --> 1:46:21.860]  in the situation, he actually had to pay somebody, like he pretty much like our headline was
[1:46:21.860 --> 1:46:25.580]  not lying, he did get robbed just to leave out of here alive.
[1:46:25.580 --> 1:46:30.340]  So basically it's like paying off the mafia to put harassing you or whatever.
[1:46:30.340 --> 1:46:34.740]  Yeah, if you don't believe in their ideology, definitely, definitely, man, and we were lucky
[1:46:34.740 --> 1:46:39.180]  to get a tour, you know, you know how infowars is we're here for the people.
[1:46:39.180 --> 1:46:42.380]  So when we explained them, like this is why we're so close because they're gonna, they're
[1:46:42.380 --> 1:46:46.980]  gonna ABC back there who's listening and complying is gonna chop this up and they're gonna look
[1:46:46.980 --> 1:46:48.060]  like the bad guy.
[1:46:48.060 --> 1:46:50.100]  I was like, we have to be here for a reason.
[1:46:50.100 --> 1:46:53.540]  And after that, they kind of understood and they're kind of like backed off on us.
[1:46:53.540 --> 1:46:57.300]  But there's still those people who aren't, who are here to create chaos and those are
[1:46:57.300 --> 1:47:00.540]  the people who are driving him out, those are the people who are ripping his flag.
[1:47:00.540 --> 1:47:04.540]  Those are the people who, like there's people here who understood this little, this black
[1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:08.500]  lady was like, as a black lady, he's, I don't believe why he's here, but I believe he has
[1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:10.060]  the right to be here.
[1:47:10.060 --> 1:47:13.420]  And she explained that it wasn't a black person who ripped that flag out of that guy's off
[1:47:13.420 --> 1:47:15.220]  that guy's flagpole.
[1:47:15.220 --> 1:47:18.540]  And they stole his hat twice, but they did return his hat.
[1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:23.220]  They stole his flag twice and they returned it twice, but he had to pay for, yeah, well,
[1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:26.340]  you gotta pay the mafia, you know, you gotta pay off the mafia.
[1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:27.540]  So they got to get their cut.
[1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:33.020]  You know, it's funny though, because this whole thing, these people think they're anti-establishment
[1:47:33.020 --> 1:47:36.460]  and they really may be in their belief, but they don't understand how they're a pawn of
[1:47:36.460 --> 1:47:37.460]  the establishment.
[1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:42.140]  I mean, when you're talking to these people, I guess that ask you about info wars or when
[1:47:42.140 --> 1:47:47.820]  you bring that up, I mean, do they understand like info wars is the epitome of anti-establishment?
[1:47:47.820 --> 1:47:52.340]  Like there is no head tip of the spear against the establishment like inforce.
[1:47:52.340 --> 1:47:55.580]  Even if they don't like some of our politics, do they understand that?
[1:47:55.580 --> 1:47:57.220]  No, they don't, man.
[1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:00.980]  It's literally, it's still one side of the other out here.
[1:48:00.980 --> 1:48:06.020]  There's not really the conversation that they, they're a little conversation they do have.
[1:48:06.020 --> 1:48:10.300]  It's one, it's one sided, it's either one, I mean, it's, it's, you know, it's the same
[1:48:10.300 --> 1:48:13.060]  side of the two sides of the same coin.
[1:48:13.060 --> 1:48:17.660]  And yesterday I would admit they did have two like circle rallies, kind of where they
[1:48:17.660 --> 1:48:23.420]  actually spoke about, you know, their, their feelings and how, what kind of change should
[1:48:23.420 --> 1:48:25.060]  be, should come about.
[1:48:25.060 --> 1:48:28.660]  And we have one clip of one guy who was actually able to speak the truth.
[1:48:28.660 --> 1:48:32.260]  They literally the same stuff that we would say, but he was black, so he was able to say
[1:48:32.260 --> 1:48:34.660]  it to them and they were able to applause.
[1:48:34.660 --> 1:48:38.820]  But as far as all the partying, I mean, it's more of right now, over the weekend, it was
[1:48:38.820 --> 1:48:42.380]  a tourist, the people who came, they were like, right now they'd be full of drunk people
[1:48:42.380 --> 1:48:43.380]  out here.
[1:48:43.380 --> 1:48:47.500]  Right now, as you can see, it's just the people who actually staying here for a good amount
[1:48:47.500 --> 1:48:48.800]  of time.
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:53.500]  And those are the people who, they know how the system works, nobody will speak on Rassamone.
[1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:58.540]  Like you, you might have even, even in general conversation, not even on camera, you bring
[1:48:58.540 --> 1:49:01.220]  it up and they're like, well, we're not speaking about that, man.
[1:49:01.220 --> 1:49:05.100]  And I got shut down about four times and when, when they actually brought up Rassamone, they,
[1:49:05.100 --> 1:49:07.980]  they actually like stopped the whole conversation.
[1:49:07.980 --> 1:49:09.780]  I just changed the subject.
[1:49:09.780 --> 1:49:15.260]  So, you know, and I kind of assumed this guy organically just decided to take over, but
[1:49:15.260 --> 1:49:20.340]  it's getting a little more suspicious with, with the hush money and the payoffs and then
[1:49:20.340 --> 1:49:25.460]  the Tesla and the guns, that's, that's kind of odd stuff.
[1:49:25.460 --> 1:49:27.420]  And yes, dude, it really, really is.
[1:49:27.420 --> 1:49:31.980]  And what's, what's crazy about that is how secretive that little part is, but we do have
[1:49:31.980 --> 1:49:37.500]  a big kind of break about that because yesterday we were able to talk, we kind of got in with
[1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:40.180]  two heads of security yesterday, actually three.
[1:49:40.180 --> 1:49:44.860]  And two of them, one of them gave us a tour and one of them last night, he kind of explained
[1:49:44.860 --> 1:49:50.340]  the whole Rass situation, um, along with, uh, Jack, so big.
[1:49:50.340 --> 1:49:55.980]  And we have on record of the head of security out here saying that Jack was so big is lying
[1:49:55.980 --> 1:49:57.940]  and that he's, uh, making up these allegations.
[1:49:57.940 --> 1:50:00.580]  Um, they might have some type of video of a tussle.
[1:50:00.580 --> 1:50:04.460]  There was because that guy was, you know, being very disrespectful, but the whole outlook
[1:50:04.460 --> 1:50:11.940]  on Roz, um, has kind of been, um, he's, he's for the people, but as far as the business
[1:50:11.940 --> 1:50:13.940]  section, no one talks about.
[1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:18.620]  So you know, we, we, we do have exclusive, uh, of audio, uh, from, from that, from the
[1:50:18.620 --> 1:50:22.820]  actual head of security out here explaining, you know, the fire situation and the theft
[1:50:22.820 --> 1:50:24.740]  situation of Roz.
[1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:28.820]  So that's really as far as it, as far out as the information we've been able to gather
[1:50:28.820 --> 1:50:33.220]  about Roz is that he's for the people, but he's, uh, he's actually, you know, but he's
[1:50:33.220 --> 1:50:34.220]  honest.
[1:50:34.220 --> 1:50:36.220]  He's for his own business as well.
[1:50:36.220 --> 1:50:39.580]  Well, and look, I'm, I mean, I'm kind of a second amendment purist.
[1:50:39.580 --> 1:50:42.860]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and attack the guy, I guess for distributing weapons
[1:50:42.860 --> 1:50:44.860]  to the people, uh, I'm not the left.
[1:50:44.860 --> 1:50:50.100]  It's anti second amendment that's now been totally proven as, uh, as just another hypocrisy
[1:50:50.100 --> 1:50:51.100]  of the left.
[1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:55.940]  Um, but you know, it's funny because I see the scenes there and I see the scenes behind
[1:50:55.940 --> 1:51:00.420]  you and I see some of the scenes and you know, here's what I don't understand.
[1:51:00.420 --> 1:51:05.580]  If you want to live that life and you want to be a lazy bum and live in a, in a situation
[1:51:05.580 --> 1:51:06.580]  like this, then you know what?
[1:51:06.580 --> 1:51:07.580]  Fine.
[1:51:07.580 --> 1:51:08.580]  I feel like fine, you can do that.
[1:51:08.580 --> 1:51:11.580]  Live in a tent, live in the woods, live in a dilapidated city, live in the sewer, live
[1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:12.580]  under a bridge.
[1:51:12.580 --> 1:51:17.740]  If you want to do, I want to live, I want to have nice things like you want to have
[1:51:17.740 --> 1:51:20.660]  nice things like we want to live in an advanced civilization.
[1:51:20.660 --> 1:51:26.020]  It's like they don't even want to allow us that they don't even want to allow anyone
[1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:31.140]  in America to have an advanced civilization, advanced culture of unity.
[1:51:31.140 --> 1:51:33.140]  It's like they want to live in a crap hole.
[1:51:33.140 --> 1:51:35.700]  So they want everyone to live in a crap hole with them.
[1:51:35.700 --> 1:51:36.700]  Yes, man.
[1:51:36.700 --> 1:51:37.700]  Exactly.
[1:51:37.700 --> 1:51:41.860]  And that's the sigh about here because we have one of, one of the altercations yesterday
[1:51:41.860 --> 1:51:46.260]  there was a lot of infighting because they are upset.
[1:51:46.260 --> 1:51:50.500]  The people who are here all day are upset that the people who are here in the mornings,
[1:51:50.500 --> 1:51:54.700]  they talk about protesting and they talk about don't do drugs and they'll do party, but yet
[1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.620]  they leave at three o'clock.
[1:51:56.620 --> 1:51:58.420]  So the people who are here are frustrated.
[1:51:58.420 --> 1:51:59.900]  So they're infighting, they're doing this.
[1:51:59.900 --> 1:52:00.900]  Let's come back.
[1:52:00.900 --> 1:52:02.100]  We've got a short break here.
[1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:04.460]  Come back and expand on that for five minutes.
[1:52:04.460 --> 1:52:08.220]  I guess they're going to start making like a citizenship thing now.
[1:52:08.220 --> 1:52:11.660]  You can only come in if you're a citizen of chess.

[1:53:12.460 --> 1:53:17.060]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true
[1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:18.540]  atomic iodine.
[1:53:18.540 --> 1:53:22.800]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[1:53:22.800 --> 1:53:24.980]  deep-earth crystal nascent iodine.
[1:53:24.980 --> 1:53:26.940]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[1:53:26.940 --> 1:53:31.620]  Our proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine

[1:53:44.140 --> 1:53:48.500]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy
[1:53:48.500 --> 1:53:52.580]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[1:53:52.580 --> 1:53:57.140]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.

[1:54:09.620 --> 1:54:14.620]  That's infowarstore.com.
[1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:38.100]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:38.100 --> 1:54:48.260]  I guess the eternal question is, should you care about the Chazz Zone and Ra's running
[1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:49.420]  Seattle?
[1:54:49.420 --> 1:54:50.420]  Should you care?
[1:54:50.420 --> 1:54:53.980]  If you're not in Seattle, should it bother you?
[1:54:53.980 --> 1:54:58.580]  If you're not in a major Democrat city that may descend into this, should it bother you?
[1:54:58.580 --> 1:55:01.100]  Should we just let this happen?
[1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:03.900]  I think there's a fair debate on both sides.
[1:55:03.900 --> 1:55:10.900]  I think it was also a setup for President Trump that he did not take the bait on, so
[1:55:10.900 --> 1:55:13.260]  I would at least agree with the non-response there.
[1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:16.220]  I'm more upset with the president for not arresting the treasonous actors, but that's
[1:55:16.220 --> 1:55:18.220]  a side issue.
[1:55:18.220 --> 1:55:22.180]  He's letting the left destroy its own cities, and I think that's what they deserve.
[1:55:22.180 --> 1:55:25.700]  Now, Rob, you've broken some news here.
[1:55:25.700 --> 1:55:34.380]  The Chazz Chop Zone has actually gotten a little smaller from four blocks to six blocks,
[1:55:34.380 --> 1:55:41.140]  but also that, I guess as time goes on, the whole agenda or the whole purpose of everything
[1:55:41.140 --> 1:55:44.340]  is kind of getting lost, and then they realize, you know what, most people are just coming
[1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:47.620]  in here to party during the day or during the night, and then they leave.
[1:55:47.620 --> 1:55:52.340]  People are taking that personally, so where do you see this situation going, and what
[1:55:52.340 --> 1:55:55.420]  else do you need to report right now?
[1:55:55.420 --> 1:56:00.340]  I don't see how much longer they can last.
[1:56:00.340 --> 1:56:03.060]  Like I said, yesterday, there was a lot of in-fighting, and they called out each other
[1:56:03.060 --> 1:56:07.220]  for not being able to shower, not being prepared.
[1:56:07.220 --> 1:56:12.900]  They explained that if, honestly, like you said, it's a good no-response from Trump,
[1:56:12.900 --> 1:56:15.740]  because if you want to come in here and take these people out, like the ones who are still
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:19.780]  here right now, they're defenseless, they're helpless, like, you're going to have to take
[1:56:19.780 --> 1:56:24.740]  most of them to the state hospital, which are closed, so I don't...
[1:56:24.740 --> 1:56:26.380]  There is no long run here.
[1:56:26.380 --> 1:56:29.340]  They know that this is not going to last forever, especially that one of the security
[1:56:29.340 --> 1:56:33.180]  guards that was talking yesterday, they're like, yeah, we know we're not ready, because
[1:56:33.180 --> 1:56:37.460]  this might not even last forever, but we need to get our point across.
[1:56:37.460 --> 1:56:42.420]  And I was telling Dario, man, like, Jack Mesovic, he's not allowed in here, ABC, they're probably
[1:56:42.420 --> 1:56:43.820]  not going to let back in here.
[1:56:43.820 --> 1:56:48.380]  There's a lot of these news organizations who are coming in here and not are putting gas
[1:56:48.380 --> 1:56:53.900]  to their fire, and kind of making it worse for them being here because they're making
[1:56:53.900 --> 1:56:55.700]  it seem like a war zone.
[1:56:55.700 --> 1:56:59.420]  That's only going to tempt people to, oh, why isn't Trump doing anything?
[1:56:59.420 --> 1:57:04.340]  Like, if people were to come out here, it's like, right now, they'd be like, well, ah,
[1:57:04.340 --> 1:57:08.940]  this is a morning of wood stock, like, it's actually just clean, that's all it is.
[1:57:08.940 --> 1:57:12.980]  So the people are going to get tired of giving donations, people are going to get tired of
[1:57:12.980 --> 1:57:16.140]  helping each other out, and like you said, you hit it right on the nail, they don't want
[1:57:16.140 --> 1:57:17.940]  to live in advanced civilization.
[1:57:17.940 --> 1:57:22.220]  So what happens when they're like, damn, I miss kind of laying in my own bed, I miss
[1:57:22.220 --> 1:57:25.780]  laying in my, you know, taking a bath, having a shower.
[1:57:25.780 --> 1:57:26.780]  Yeah.
[1:57:26.780 --> 1:57:27.780]  What's this?
[1:57:27.780 --> 1:57:28.780]  They can't take showers.
[1:57:28.780 --> 1:57:30.580]  No, there's not a shower set up out here at all.
[1:57:30.580 --> 1:57:31.940]  There's a hand washing station.
[1:57:31.940 --> 1:57:33.900]  That is one hand washing station.
[1:57:33.900 --> 1:57:35.100]  Like, that's it.
[1:57:35.100 --> 1:57:37.500]  They don't really have running water.
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:39.580]  It's literally all awful donations.
[1:57:39.580 --> 1:57:45.160]  It's like a third world country who knows kind of how to clean up after each other or themselves.
[1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:48.220]  But they're only the only people who are cleaning are the volunteers.
[1:57:48.220 --> 1:57:53.500]  So I don't, I don't see this lasting long.
[1:57:53.500 --> 1:57:57.780]  We had the average music festival like will go the longest, like a week, you know, people
[1:57:57.780 --> 1:57:59.060]  get burned out or whatever.
[1:57:59.060 --> 1:58:02.060]  I mean, is that kind of like where the energy you're feeling right now?
[1:58:02.060 --> 1:58:03.940]  It's just like, okay, we're kind of getting burned out.
[1:58:03.940 --> 1:58:05.340]  This was fun.
[1:58:05.340 --> 1:58:09.700]  But there's no, there's nowhere this can really go from here.
[1:58:09.700 --> 1:58:10.780]  That's what I feel.
[1:58:10.780 --> 1:58:14.700]  But these guys are, are, are amped up, man.
[1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:18.380]  I just, I will say this for sure, man.
[1:58:18.380 --> 1:58:22.260]  I wouldn't be able to be giving you this interview right now or we weren't being able to stay
[1:58:22.260 --> 1:58:27.380]  up as late as we did last night if I didn't have turbo force, like turbo force is the
[1:58:27.380 --> 1:58:30.180]  best thing that we probably have in my opinion at the store.
[1:58:30.180 --> 1:58:33.220]  Wait, are you on turbo force right now?
[1:58:33.220 --> 1:58:34.220]  Right now.
[1:58:34.220 --> 1:58:38.700]  Like that was one of the first things I did before I even brushed my teeth and took a
[1:58:38.700 --> 1:58:39.700]  shower.
[1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:40.700]  You know, we have a hotel guys.
[1:58:40.700 --> 1:58:43.980]  I'm not like, we stayed here maybe pretty late last night.
[1:58:43.980 --> 1:58:48.060]  Yeah, I could have stayed, stayed the night, but now we went to take a shower.
[1:58:48.060 --> 1:58:51.420]  But yeah, man, definitely turbo force.
[1:58:51.420 --> 1:58:55.820]  I can go for another literally five, six hours without eating, no problem, get some energy
[1:58:55.820 --> 1:58:57.820]  from eating and keep going.
[1:58:57.820 --> 1:58:59.900]  But it really has died down here, man.
[1:58:59.900 --> 1:59:05.300]  And I think that maybe after they wake up and you know, things get going yesterday around
[1:59:05.300 --> 1:59:06.300]  two o'clock.
[1:59:06.300 --> 1:59:07.300]  We gotta take a break.
[1:59:07.300 --> 1:59:08.300]  Stay right there.
[1:59:08.300 --> 1:59:09.300]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[1:59:09.300 --> 1:59:10.300]  You've got the turbo force energy.
[1:59:10.300 --> 1:59:14.860]  So let's keep Rob with us for another segment here on the Alex Jones show, breaking news
[1:59:14.860 --> 1:59:20.500]  live boots on the ground from chop, jazz nation.

[2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:32.020]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[2:00:32.020 --> 2:00:46.300]  And now your host, Owen Troyer, apparently that's a thing I don't even know.
[2:00:46.300 --> 2:00:53.340]  All right, we got Rob Boots on the ground from chop, jazz, chop, so Jeff, you do the
[2:00:53.340 --> 2:01:02.020]  jazz chop with me.
[2:01:02.020 --> 2:01:06.700]  Maybe that's what the chopchass needs to kind of reunify and reenergize because apparently
[2:01:06.700 --> 2:01:11.820]  the movement is starting to die down as the food shortages and the lack of showering and
[2:01:11.820 --> 2:01:15.260]  such and people are just getting burnt out.
[2:01:15.260 --> 2:01:18.740]  But let me ask you this question, Rob, is you're live on the boots on the ground there
[2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:20.580]  from Chazz Chop.
[2:01:20.580 --> 2:01:25.620]  The president signed an executive order today on police reform.
[2:01:25.620 --> 2:01:29.380]  Some of the president's most ardent supporters and a lot of conservative commentators are
[2:01:29.380 --> 2:01:33.820]  saying that it's not a victory for President Trump, a huge victory for Democrats and for
[2:01:33.820 --> 2:01:35.820]  the left who are not going to vote for him anyway.
[2:01:35.820 --> 2:01:39.300]  But I'm curious and maybe they're not awake yet.
[2:01:39.300 --> 2:01:41.540]  So they may not know about this executive order.
[2:01:41.540 --> 2:01:44.700]  But Trump signs an executive order on police reform.
[2:01:44.700 --> 2:01:47.580]  This is right along the lines of what these people want.
[2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:49.140]  Do you think there'll be any give?
[2:01:49.140 --> 2:01:50.500]  Do you think there'll be any praise?
[2:01:50.500 --> 2:01:54.180]  Do you think they'll even hear about this?
[2:01:54.180 --> 2:01:58.780]  They won't hear about it and they won't care because they don't want reform.
[2:01:58.780 --> 2:02:01.340]  They want abolishment.
[2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:08.060]  Even like what's crazy is some of the sweetest people we've talked to and they cold hearted
[2:02:08.060 --> 2:02:12.060]  like just volunteers, they're like, so what do you think they should do?
[2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:13.060]  What kind of reform?
[2:02:13.060 --> 2:02:14.060]  Oh, we don't need reform.
[2:02:14.060 --> 2:02:15.660]  They just need to be gone.
[2:02:15.660 --> 2:02:16.660]  They need to be gone.
[2:02:16.660 --> 2:02:19.780]  They need to let these people and it's funny because they literally say these people, they
[2:02:19.780 --> 2:02:22.660]  need to let these people take care of themselves.
[2:02:22.660 --> 2:02:29.220]  And it just shocks me how many people are for abolishing and just total disbandment of
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:30.900]  the police department.
[2:02:30.900 --> 2:02:34.020]  And it's like, okay, so what do you want like state government, you want federal government?
[2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:35.860]  They're like, I don't know.
[2:02:35.860 --> 2:02:37.420]  All we need is the local police to be gone.
[2:02:37.420 --> 2:02:38.660]  We don't care.
[2:02:38.660 --> 2:02:41.420]  And it's like, you can tell they only know those talking points.
[2:02:41.420 --> 2:02:47.940]  So honestly, I guess they don't want this precinct back open as an actual precinct at
[2:02:47.940 --> 2:02:48.940]  all.
[2:02:48.940 --> 2:02:50.140]  They want it to be a community center.
[2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:54.100]  So some people say they're not leaving until that's a community center.
[2:02:54.100 --> 2:02:58.140]  And some people are saying, well, we just want some type of changes.
[2:02:58.140 --> 2:03:01.500]  So the ones who are actually living here, they want abolishment.
[2:03:01.500 --> 2:03:03.140]  They don't want reform.
[2:03:03.140 --> 2:03:06.140]  Have they been able to think down the line with this?
[2:03:06.140 --> 2:03:10.580]  I mean, does that put rise in charge or do they get their own guns or is there no law
[2:03:10.580 --> 2:03:11.580]  enforcement?
[2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:14.860]  Is it just anarchy or what do they even think about that?
[2:03:14.860 --> 2:03:16.220]  They're mindless, dude.
[2:03:16.220 --> 2:03:17.220]  There is no thinking.
[2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:20.660]  You can't lodge who you think ahead.
[2:03:20.660 --> 2:03:24.500]  That's like I was telling, I might have told you or Harrison yesterday, but standing in
[2:03:24.500 --> 2:03:29.260]  the middle of the crowd during the weekend, it's you're surrounded by a crowd of zombies.
[2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:30.540]  No one knows where to go.
[2:03:30.540 --> 2:03:32.740]  No one knows what they're doing, why they're there.
[2:03:32.740 --> 2:03:33.740]  They're just in the shop.
[2:03:33.740 --> 2:03:34.740]  They're like, holy shit.
[2:03:34.740 --> 2:03:35.740]  Oh, excuse me.
[2:03:35.740 --> 2:03:39.420]  But like, it's, it's just, they don't know what he's in shop jazz.
[2:03:39.420 --> 2:03:42.500]  It's, you know, it's, you know, it's got a little mouthy over there.
[2:03:42.500 --> 2:03:45.060]  It's the new language they're developing.
[2:03:45.060 --> 2:03:48.940]  It's just crazy how many people, it's okay.
[2:03:48.940 --> 2:03:50.420]  You were speaking chop for a second.
[2:03:50.420 --> 2:03:51.420]  We get it.
[2:03:51.420 --> 2:03:52.420]  Yeah.
[2:03:52.420 --> 2:03:54.460]  But it's just how many people are mindless, man.
[2:03:54.460 --> 2:03:55.460]  It's getting frustrating.
[2:03:55.460 --> 2:04:01.460]  Well, here's, here's what I don't understand and this is just basic common sense.
[2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:05.340]  It's like, if we're just, like if Rob and I are say, you know, just hanging out after
[2:04:05.340 --> 2:04:08.460]  work or, you know, having to drink at a bar or something, we're just having, just having
[2:04:08.460 --> 2:04:09.460]  a conversation.
[2:04:09.460 --> 2:04:13.220]  It's like, we don't even get like modern common sense in conversation anymore.
[2:04:13.220 --> 2:04:16.020]  It's like, okay, well, there are some issues with police and stuff.
[2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:17.020]  We could reform some stuff.
[2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:18.460]  I'd be down to reform some stuff.
[2:04:18.460 --> 2:04:26.220]  I'd say all nonviolent criminals that are currently in jail, you know, should be released.
[2:04:26.220 --> 2:04:28.020]  Nonviolent criminals should not be behind bars.
[2:04:28.020 --> 2:04:29.020]  Okay.
[2:04:29.020 --> 2:04:32.700]  There's some reform that would, that would help, I think, and would appease some people.
[2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:33.700]  Okay.
[2:04:33.700 --> 2:04:34.700]  Let's end the war on drugs.
[2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:38.300]  Let's get police stop from pulling us over for not having a seat belt or being on our
[2:04:38.300 --> 2:04:40.380]  cell phone or some other such nonsense.
[2:04:40.380 --> 2:04:45.340]  Let's just stop giving police these tiny tic-tac reasons to get involved in our lives and bother
[2:04:45.340 --> 2:04:46.340]  us.
[2:04:46.340 --> 2:04:47.340]  Hey, that, that's reform.
[2:04:47.340 --> 2:04:51.060]  I think everybody could get behind, but no, now we just attacked the police and now we
[2:04:51.060 --> 2:04:54.220]  open it up for the, for the left to get even more violent.
[2:04:54.220 --> 2:04:55.220]  Yes, man.
[2:04:55.220 --> 2:05:00.500]  And what do you think, what do you think these criminals that they let go because of coronavirus
[2:05:00.500 --> 2:05:01.500]  are going to go?
[2:05:01.500 --> 2:05:04.500]  Oh, to the land where there's no laws.
[2:05:04.500 --> 2:05:08.940]  I mean, what happens when these places start popping up all over the United States and
[2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:10.380]  they call in these protests?
[2:05:10.380 --> 2:05:15.460]  Like what happens when they take over Congress and, you know, 35, what happens when they
[2:05:15.460 --> 2:05:17.820]  shut down the highway before the autonomous zone?
[2:05:17.820 --> 2:05:20.260]  And then we have just illegals.
[2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:23.500]  We have all these felons, like they're all living in this crazy area.
[2:05:23.500 --> 2:05:27.020]  Like, you're right, dude, it's just going to be anarchy and they, they, they don't see
[2:05:27.020 --> 2:05:28.020]  that.
[2:05:28.020 --> 2:05:30.660]  And what you're talking about reform right now, I just, I just saw some police reform
[2:05:30.660 --> 2:05:31.660]  right now.
[2:05:31.660 --> 2:05:36.220]  This guy literally stole a whole thing of donuts from one of the places and they were, they
[2:05:36.220 --> 2:05:37.220]  started chasing them.
[2:05:37.220 --> 2:05:38.220]  They're like, no, don't chase them.
[2:05:38.220 --> 2:05:39.540]  He's not well.
[2:05:39.540 --> 2:05:44.060]  And it's like, so you can steal as long as you just say you're not well, like it's,
[2:05:44.060 --> 2:05:45.060]  Oh boy.
[2:05:45.060 --> 2:05:50.180]  The liberal start plans to steal everything, which they're already doing exactly, man.
[2:05:50.180 --> 2:05:55.140]  And even though we, we tracked down that business that supposedly got looted and the guy was
[2:05:55.140 --> 2:05:59.580]  like, no, the windows were already broken.
[2:05:59.580 --> 2:06:01.860]  And he, I was like, do you want to tell a story about, there's no story.
[2:06:01.860 --> 2:06:07.260]  Like they did this couple of days ago and it's like, okay, like they, it's just so many
[2:06:07.260 --> 2:06:10.220]  people are so misunderstanding the whole situation over here.
[2:06:10.220 --> 2:06:13.620]  Like it's a war zone, but at the same time they are letting these people do whatever
[2:06:13.620 --> 2:06:14.620]  they want.
[2:06:14.620 --> 2:06:20.660]  Um, they say they have a medics and doctors who are official who are just undercover.
[2:06:20.660 --> 2:06:24.340]  And it's like, man, so many mentally ill people are out here.
[2:06:24.340 --> 2:06:25.340]  There's no doctors out here.
[2:06:25.340 --> 2:06:26.340]  Man, there's people.
[2:06:26.340 --> 2:06:27.340]  Yeah.
[2:06:27.340 --> 2:06:28.340]  That's not a recipe for disaster.
[2:06:28.340 --> 2:06:29.340]  Oh yeah.
[2:06:29.340 --> 2:06:30.340]  I'm a doctor here.
[2:06:30.340 --> 2:06:31.340]  Come have some surgery.
[2:06:31.340 --> 2:06:32.340]  Yeah.
[2:06:32.340 --> 2:06:33.340]  You never see your liver again.
[2:06:33.340 --> 2:06:37.140]  Uh, what about, uh, there were rumors that bikers for Trump or some other Trump groups
[2:06:37.140 --> 2:06:38.660]  were headed up or into the zone.
[2:06:38.660 --> 2:06:40.540]  Have you seen or heard any of that?
[2:06:40.540 --> 2:06:41.740]  No, man.
[2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:46.220]  I, um, I did have some people reach out and say that, uh, one said that they were coming
[2:06:46.220 --> 2:06:51.300]  and then another said that they're, they're planning a fourth of July, uh, cleanup celebration
[2:06:51.300 --> 2:06:52.300]  over here.
[2:06:52.300 --> 2:06:55.820]  So they're saying if this is still going on around the fourth of July, that they are
[2:06:55.820 --> 2:07:00.260]  going to come up here and they're going to peacefully clean up the trash that has been
[2:07:00.260 --> 2:07:02.420]  occupying the space.
[2:07:02.420 --> 2:07:07.260]  So that's going to be an interesting event, um, comes July 4th.
[2:07:07.260 --> 2:07:11.980]  But as of right now, uh, it's already no action yesterday, you know, Patriot prayer
[2:07:11.980 --> 2:07:16.940]  showed up and they really didn't, they didn't really hassle them too much.
[2:07:16.940 --> 2:07:24.000]  We also got, um, a breakdown of why the, that other pastor who was, uh, who was assaulted
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:25.620]  like he, his name was actually Matthew.
[2:07:25.620 --> 2:07:29.820]  We met, we met his friend and the guy is mentally ill and he was running around, putting
[2:07:29.820 --> 2:07:32.140]  his speaker inside people's ears.
[2:07:32.140 --> 2:07:34.780]  That's what they were trying to take a speaker from him and the people who were beating him
[2:07:34.780 --> 2:07:39.140]  up or supposedly beat him up or his own people because they were, he was going around and
[2:07:39.140 --> 2:07:40.540]  trying to hurt other people.
[2:07:40.540 --> 2:07:45.020]  Well, explain this because, because that's a, I'm glad that you broke this story cause
[2:07:45.020 --> 2:07:47.340]  a lot of people wouldn't have heard that.
[2:07:47.340 --> 2:07:51.580]  I mean, cause, cause it sounds to me like they're pretty much rejecting most, if not
[2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:53.300]  all media.
[2:07:53.300 --> 2:07:57.460]  So how do they expect the truth to get out when they're not letting media in and, and
[2:07:57.460 --> 2:08:00.900]  stories can easily be distorted or twisted.
[2:08:00.900 --> 2:08:02.980]  That's exactly what we broke down to them.
[2:08:02.980 --> 2:08:05.900]  And when we said that to them, it was just like a eye-opening event.
[2:08:05.900 --> 2:08:10.140]  They were like, Oh, you know what, yeah, let him go, let him through, let him through.
[2:08:10.140 --> 2:08:14.940]  So it's, when you're genuine with these people, when you actually have a conversation and
[2:08:14.940 --> 2:08:19.500]  they see that you're not here out to like make them look bad, then it's kind of a whole
[2:08:19.500 --> 2:08:20.900]  different outlook.
[2:08:20.900 --> 2:08:24.860]  But you know, CBS and ABC who were out here, you know, they're out here for their money
[2:08:24.860 --> 2:08:25.860]  shots.
[2:08:25.860 --> 2:08:29.100]  So they're trying to get in and the security that they do have here, you know, they bumps
[2:08:29.100 --> 2:08:36.420]  heads with him and they got to the point to where the CBS camera man bodyguard, he threatened
[2:08:36.420 --> 2:08:42.260]  to sue somebody because they touched his, they touched his camera man.
[2:08:42.260 --> 2:08:46.220]  And the guy that he said that to, he just let, he stopped and he looked at me left.
[2:08:46.220 --> 2:08:48.700]  He goes, where are the cops going to come for you, bro?
[2:08:48.700 --> 2:08:54.340]  And that camera man and the bodyguard had this like, Oh, you know, like, Oh, yeah, there's
[2:08:54.340 --> 2:08:55.340]  no cops coming.
[2:08:55.340 --> 2:08:58.580]  He's like, yeah, so you better listen or you better you're going to get knocked out.
[2:08:58.580 --> 2:09:00.020]  And they backed up and they were off.
[2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:04.860]  So it's like, if you're not really accepted in this community, they will treat you.
[2:09:04.860 --> 2:09:08.620]  You know, as you saw with the guy with the Trump flag, you know, they, they, they didn't
[2:09:08.620 --> 2:09:09.620]  treat him too nice.
[2:09:09.620 --> 2:09:12.660]  So if they don't like you out here, they definitely will, will make you get out.
[2:09:12.660 --> 2:09:17.980]  Well, I would say that, you know, chop Chaz's a stand is, is the epitome of what the left
[2:09:17.980 --> 2:09:20.260]  wants for every city in America.
[2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:21.780]  And so it's kind of a test run.
[2:09:21.780 --> 2:09:28.100]  And so we'll give them the test run and we'll see how successful or how lack of successful
[2:09:28.100 --> 2:09:29.100]  it is.
[2:09:29.100 --> 2:09:30.100]  All right, Rob.
[2:09:30.100 --> 2:09:33.340]  Anything else you want to report before we let you go?
[2:09:33.340 --> 2:09:34.340]  Not much, man.
[2:09:34.340 --> 2:09:38.900]  We're going to be here all day and all night and we'll be checked, you know, at the daily
[2:09:38.900 --> 2:09:43.940]  Chaz we'll be giving you daily updates, videos and pictures of the day of the day's, you
[2:09:43.940 --> 2:09:45.860]  know, course and what's going on out here.
[2:09:45.860 --> 2:09:49.780]  So we'll bring you all the news we can out here as long as we are out here.
[2:09:49.780 --> 2:09:50.780]  All right.
[2:09:50.780 --> 2:09:53.700]  The people of chop have spoken.
[2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:57.460]  He's kind of got like a HBV one chop visa.
[2:09:57.460 --> 2:09:58.460]  It's unofficial.
[2:09:58.460 --> 2:10:03.780]  Rob has the HBV one chop visa for, for, he's allowed to work there for another couple days
[2:10:03.780 --> 2:10:07.460]  and then they're going to have to renew his application process so that he's allowed to
[2:10:07.460 --> 2:10:10.220]  stay in the chop Chaz's a stand country.
[2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:11.220]  All right.
[2:10:11.220 --> 2:10:15.700]  When we come back, I'm going to open up the phone lines and cover some of this news and
[2:10:15.700 --> 2:10:16.700]  take your calls.
[2:10:16.700 --> 2:10:29.340]  Yeah, globalists have gotten away with their Russia gate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their
[2:10:29.340 --> 2:10:30.340]  COVID-19 hoax.
[2:10:30.340 --> 2:10:36.060]  And now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[2:10:36.060 --> 2:10:39.180]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[2:10:39.180 --> 2:10:44.180]  Well, I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even
[2:10:44.180 --> 2:10:45.500]  a bigger race war.
[2:10:45.500 --> 2:10:51.220]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[2:10:51.220 --> 2:10:53.820]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[2:10:53.820 --> 2:10:58.060]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor inflores off
[2:10:58.060 --> 2:11:02.980]  the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want
[2:11:02.980 --> 2:11:05.140]  the people's voice to still be on air.
[2:11:05.140 --> 2:11:09.340]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[2:11:09.340 --> 2:11:17.180]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now, more than ever, infowars.com
[2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:18.260]  lives.
[2:11:18.260 --> 2:11:22.940]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[2:11:22.940 --> 2:11:28.180]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:31.980]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[2:11:31.980 --> 2:11:39.300]  And now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[2:11:39.300 --> 2:11:44.740]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[2:11:44.740 --> 2:11:47.460]  You must decide which side you're on.
[2:11:47.460 --> 2:11:52.020]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you
[2:11:52.020 --> 2:11:55.420]  into misery, destruction, and finally death.
[2:11:55.420 --> 2:12:00.780]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[2:12:00.780 --> 2:12:03.500]  The delusions must end now.
[2:12:03.500 --> 2:12:08.900]  Info wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[2:12:08.900 --> 2:12:11.980]  The people that are aware of the new will decide to join it out of fear.
[2:12:11.980 --> 2:12:21.660]  They are truly fools, we must fight this or lose our souls.
[2:12:21.660 --> 2:12:36.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:36.740 --> 2:12:44.220]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[2:12:44.220 --> 2:12:47.580]  All right, I said I'd take your call, so I'm going to open up the phone lines, but we're
[2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:50.780]  really only going to have one segment to do it, but we'll just do that anyway.
[2:12:50.780 --> 2:12:54.900]  And then Alex Jones is going to be coming back before Paul Joseph Watson takes over
[2:12:54.900 --> 2:12:55.900]  in the fourth hour.
[2:12:55.900 --> 2:13:05.260]  So the phone number to call if you want to get in 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539 in the meantime,
[2:13:05.260 --> 2:13:11.820]  I will do some news coverage here, New York police department disbands, plain closed units
[2:13:11.820 --> 2:13:13.380]  involved in many shootings.
[2:13:13.380 --> 2:13:15.620]  Well, that's a misnomer.
[2:13:15.620 --> 2:13:24.580]  What they did was they disbanded the anti-crime units, which were actually the most responsible
[2:13:24.580 --> 2:13:31.220]  for gun arrests for illegal guns and criminals that had guns that weren't supposed to.
[2:13:31.220 --> 2:13:35.700]  So I'm sure that'll go really well for New York.
[2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:40.260]  Federal execution set to resume after nearly two decade hiatus.
[2:13:40.260 --> 2:13:44.220]  Did John Brennan just crap his britches?
[2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:49.380]  Next LGBTQ rights legal battle looms after Supreme Court victory.
[2:13:49.380 --> 2:13:52.100]  Oh, this is such a joke.
[2:13:52.100 --> 2:13:55.940]  In fact, I think I'm going to go all the way, would this be considered extreme right-wingism
[2:13:55.940 --> 2:13:58.340]  or extreme left-wingism?
[2:13:58.340 --> 2:14:04.060]  I now declare, I think that it should be legal for you to discriminate in your place of business.
[2:14:04.060 --> 2:14:05.060]  Why not?
[2:14:05.060 --> 2:14:07.860]  Hell, you can discriminate against a conservative or a whitey.
[2:14:07.860 --> 2:14:11.220]  Why not just say you can discriminate against everybody?
[2:14:11.220 --> 2:14:17.660]  So now everybody has minority or special protections.
[2:14:17.660 --> 2:14:22.700]  And based on that ideology, I can literally just claim I'm a woman right now, but they
[2:14:22.700 --> 2:14:25.540]  won't allow that because they realize how ridiculous it is.
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:29.460]  But it's nice that the Supreme Court is now up here, you know, talking about sex again
[2:14:29.460 --> 2:14:33.740]  and talking about wee-wees and PPs while the country is being burned to the ground.
[2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:35.380]  Real good job, Supreme Court.
[2:14:35.380 --> 2:14:38.700]  You guys are just right on the money.
[2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:43.140]  Yeah, let's talk about gay sex at the Supreme Court.
[2:14:43.140 --> 2:14:45.180]  All right, that'll be the big issue.
[2:14:45.180 --> 2:14:49.260]  Let's protect, let's protect people that chopped their wieners off.
[2:14:49.260 --> 2:14:53.100]  Yeah, can't discriminate against them.
[2:14:53.100 --> 2:14:54.100]  What a joke.
[2:14:54.100 --> 2:14:59.020]  U.S. casinos push for cashless gambling payments, siding virus.
[2:14:59.020 --> 2:15:00.020]  There you go.
[2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:01.020]  Cashless society.
[2:15:01.020 --> 2:15:04.420]  Now, if you remember, I gave you, it was like the phase 10 or nine phase plan or whatever
[2:15:04.420 --> 2:15:06.580]  it was for the New World Order.
[2:15:06.580 --> 2:15:08.220]  And that was one of them, the cashless society.
[2:15:08.220 --> 2:15:11.420]  Now they're go ahead and rolling it out.
[2:15:11.420 --> 2:15:14.380]  FDA releases this coronavirus update.
[2:15:14.380 --> 2:15:18.980]  FDA revokes emergency use, authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
[2:15:18.980 --> 2:15:20.540]  Another misnomer.
[2:15:20.540 --> 2:15:23.180]  It was never meant as a reactive measure.
[2:15:23.180 --> 2:15:24.660]  It was a preventative measure.
[2:15:24.660 --> 2:15:26.540]  So they're lying about it again.
[2:15:26.540 --> 2:15:27.540]  These people are sick, man.
[2:15:27.540 --> 2:15:30.420]  The FDA, I guess they just want you to die.
[2:15:30.420 --> 2:15:32.900]  I guess that's just how that goes.
[2:15:32.900 --> 2:15:33.900]  Yeah.
[2:15:33.900 --> 2:15:37.540]  Yeah, just wear your mask and get hypoxia too.
[2:15:37.540 --> 2:15:38.540]  It's all good.
[2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:44.700]  Oh, did you see Malik Obama, the brother of Barack Obama, tweeted out a birth certificate
[2:15:44.700 --> 2:15:50.220]  and claimed that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, which would of course make him an illegitimate
[2:15:50.220 --> 2:15:56.460]  president and therefore everything he did illegitimate and thus proving the left to
[2:15:56.460 --> 2:15:59.460]  be the dumbest people in American history.
[2:15:59.460 --> 2:16:03.020]  But we'll see if anything of that pans out.
[2:16:03.020 --> 2:16:07.900]  Buck Sexton says, how long do you think it will be before someone gets canceled for wearing
[2:16:07.900 --> 2:16:09.340]  a t-shirt that says Fox News?
[2:16:09.340 --> 2:16:14.540]  Now this is all because Mike Gundy, who is an outspoken football coach at Oklahoma State,
[2:16:14.540 --> 2:16:19.020]  which is one of the most conservative states in the union, had an OAN shirt on like, oh,
[2:16:19.020 --> 2:16:20.020]  wow.
[2:16:20.020 --> 2:16:24.380]  But, you know, here's this whole notion like somehow Fox News is beyond reproach, but if
[2:16:24.380 --> 2:16:28.180]  you're OAN or Info Wars or something else is on the fringe like, yeah, you wear that
[2:16:28.180 --> 2:16:29.340]  t-shirt, you deserve it.
[2:16:29.340 --> 2:16:30.340]  But don't come after Fox.
[2:16:30.340 --> 2:16:31.340]  No, not us.
[2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:34.100]  We're above it.
[2:16:34.100 --> 2:16:37.260]  That notion is BS.
[2:16:37.260 --> 2:16:43.220]  That's the totalitarianism of Fox to control the conservative movement, folks.
[2:16:43.220 --> 2:16:46.500]  And again, it was Buck Sexton complaining that there's no mothership for conservatives
[2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:47.580]  where you can't get banned.
[2:16:47.580 --> 2:16:51.020]  I guess you've never heard of Info Wars or banned video.
[2:16:51.020 --> 2:16:56.020]  Queen Latifah, let gone with the wind be gone with the wind.
[2:16:56.020 --> 2:16:59.940]  So they're banning gone with the wind, folks.
[2:16:59.940 --> 2:17:04.780]  You know what this is really about.
[2:17:04.780 --> 2:17:08.460]  This isn't about racism.
[2:17:08.460 --> 2:17:09.460]  Have you seen gone with the wind?
[2:17:09.460 --> 2:17:14.540]  Now, it's been a while since I've seen it, but you understand that gone with the wind,
[2:17:14.540 --> 2:17:20.780]  the quote unquote racism and gone with the wind, you realize that's the Democrat party.
[2:17:20.780 --> 2:17:28.780]  It literally tells the story about the KKK converting to Democrats and their racism.
[2:17:28.780 --> 2:17:34.420]  So the reason why Google is rewriting history claiming that Democrat and Dixie Crats are
[2:17:34.420 --> 2:17:38.380]  Republicans, the reason why they're getting rid of HBO gone with the wind is because they
[2:17:38.380 --> 2:17:40.940]  don't want you to know the truth about the Democrats.
[2:17:40.940 --> 2:17:42.420]  The Democrats were the party, the KKK.
[2:17:42.420 --> 2:17:47.500]  In fact, I'm now almost convinced that Biden is the head of the KKK.
[2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:50.140]  I'm not even joking.
[2:17:50.140 --> 2:17:54.100]  I think the Democrats are still to this day running KKK operations.
[2:17:54.100 --> 2:17:56.020]  I'm not even kidding you.
[2:17:56.020 --> 2:17:57.780]  And Biden may be the leader.
[2:17:57.780 --> 2:18:05.860]  Folks, you can go look up when the Republicans launched their platform after freeing the
[2:18:05.860 --> 2:18:16.580]  slaves, the Democrats put out propaganda for their candidates or for their politics.
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:22.220]  Literally on the pamphlets, it was attacking black people, calling them the N word, depicting
[2:18:22.220 --> 2:18:23.220]  them as clowns.
[2:18:23.220 --> 2:18:25.660]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[2:18:25.660 --> 2:18:27.060]  That's the damn Democrats.
[2:18:27.060 --> 2:18:31.100]  They're erasing that history, folks.
[2:18:31.100 --> 2:18:38.660]  People and the establishment are erasing the Democrat history of their racism of slavery
[2:18:38.660 --> 2:18:41.020]  of the KKK.
[2:18:41.020 --> 2:18:45.460]  Joe Biden is the leader of the KKK.
[2:18:45.460 --> 2:18:48.820]  Charles Barkley warns of slippery slope when it comes to NFL kneeling.
[2:18:48.820 --> 2:18:52.980]  I'm done with the NFL, sad to say I've been a big NFL fan.
[2:18:52.980 --> 2:18:55.900]  I love watching football, especially on Sundays.
[2:18:55.900 --> 2:18:58.380]  They won't get another dime from me.
[2:18:58.380 --> 2:19:00.100]  I will never go to an NFL game.
[2:19:00.100 --> 2:19:05.420]  They won't get another minute of my time if they ever do kick off their season.
[2:19:05.420 --> 2:19:08.940]  Done with all these leagues done with the NBA.
[2:19:08.940 --> 2:19:14.020]  Now I haven't gotten any BS from the NHL or the MLB as far as some virtue signaling left
[2:19:14.020 --> 2:19:15.020]  this BS.
[2:19:15.020 --> 2:19:18.620]  But the moment I do, I'm done with them as well.
[2:19:18.620 --> 2:19:24.140]  I'm done with anybody who's promoting propaganda in my face done.
[2:19:24.140 --> 2:19:28.740]  Mayor Adler puts this out today here in Austin, wearing face coverings in public helps prevent
[2:19:28.740 --> 2:19:30.340]  the spread of COVID-19.
[2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:33.300]  You can kiss my ass.
[2:19:33.300 --> 2:19:35.420]  This simple action makes a big difference in our community.
[2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:38.260]  In our community, help each other wear your masks.
[2:19:38.260 --> 2:19:39.260]  Shut the hell up.
[2:19:39.260 --> 2:19:42.060]  I'm not wearing a damn mask.
[2:19:42.060 --> 2:19:47.980]  Oh, oh, by the way, Mayor Adler and the city of Austin are now not only funding Planned
[2:19:47.980 --> 2:19:53.700]  Parenthood and giving them free rent on a building that would be millions annually.
[2:19:53.700 --> 2:20:01.580]  Now your taxpayer dollars are going to transportation for people to get an abortion.
[2:20:01.580 --> 2:20:03.500]  Wow.
[2:20:03.500 --> 2:20:04.940]  Put your tax dollars here in Austin.
[2:20:04.940 --> 2:20:05.940]  Don't stop there.
[2:20:05.940 --> 2:20:11.060]  They've now painted Black Austin matters on Congress Avenue.
[2:20:11.060 --> 2:20:15.940]  We're being ripped off and stolen and robbed from Seven Ways to Sunday by the Democrats,
[2:20:15.940 --> 2:20:16.940]  folks.
[2:20:16.940 --> 2:20:19.220]  Makes me sick.
[2:20:19.220 --> 2:20:21.300]  Tessa Majors.
[2:20:21.300 --> 2:20:25.260]  For her, no, probably not, just a white girl who was murdered in the park by Black men
[2:20:25.260 --> 2:20:26.660]  because she was white.
[2:20:26.660 --> 2:20:28.660]  Nobody heard about her.
[2:20:28.660 --> 2:20:31.500]  So that sentencing is going down right now.
[2:20:31.500 --> 2:20:32.660]  Oh, how about this?
[2:20:32.660 --> 2:20:37.500]  New York police finds no criminality after officers sickened at Shake Shack.
[2:20:37.500 --> 2:20:40.500]  Appears to be accidental.
[2:20:40.500 --> 2:20:42.100]  It appears to be accidental.
[2:20:42.100 --> 2:20:46.740]  Oh, the only three customers that got sick all day long at Shake Shack happened to be
[2:20:46.740 --> 2:20:53.460]  three police officers that had bleach in their shakes, but oh, that's just a coincidence.
[2:20:53.460 --> 2:20:57.580]  They didn't intentionally try to poison those officers, even though Shake Shack put out BLM
[2:20:57.580 --> 2:20:59.420]  propaganda just days before.
[2:20:59.420 --> 2:21:04.580]  No, no, no, no, no, no, folks, you understand the left is literally getting away with everything.
[2:21:04.580 --> 2:21:06.220]  Next will be murder.
[2:21:06.220 --> 2:21:07.420]  You think that's a joke.
[2:21:07.420 --> 2:21:09.180]  You think that sounds crazy.
[2:21:09.180 --> 2:21:10.540]  They've gone this far.
[2:21:10.540 --> 2:21:14.700]  The left will get away with murder next if we don't stop them now.
[2:21:14.700 --> 2:21:15.700]  This is attempted murder.
[2:21:15.700 --> 2:21:17.860]  They tried to murder police.
[2:21:17.860 --> 2:21:27.380]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:21:27.380 --> 2:21:35.140]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[2:21:35.140 --> 2:21:42.180]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[2:21:42.180 --> 2:21:43.180]  in males.
[2:21:43.180 --> 2:21:49.100]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[2:21:49.100 --> 2:21:53.820]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:21:53.820 --> 2:22:01.380]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[2:22:01.380 --> 2:22:06.540]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[2:22:06.540 --> 2:22:07.980]  So what are you waiting for?
[2:22:07.980 --> 2:22:10.020]  Go to the Info War store.
[2:22:10.020 --> 2:22:12.900]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:22:12.900 --> 2:22:17.380]  We're male vitality at infostore.com.
[2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:19.900]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, great suppliers.
[2:22:19.900 --> 2:22:22.860]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[2:22:22.860 --> 2:22:23.980]  It's the highest quality.
[2:22:23.980 --> 2:22:25.380]  They've got it.
[2:22:25.380 --> 2:22:29.420]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service, get some
[2:22:29.420 --> 2:22:31.580]  air before you get sucked back down.
[2:22:31.580 --> 2:22:34.100]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[2:22:34.100 --> 2:22:36.700]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[2:22:36.700 --> 2:22:42.580]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully stop the globalists and we've
[2:22:42.580 --> 2:22:47.420]  given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but we're going
[2:22:47.420 --> 2:22:49.820]  to still go down the hard road now.
[2:22:49.820 --> 2:22:53.980]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this,
[2:22:53.980 --> 2:22:55.700]  but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[2:22:55.700 --> 2:22:57.140]  You need to get high quality, storeable food.
[2:22:57.140 --> 2:22:58.380]  It's something you need.

[2:24:20.140 --> 2:24:46.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:46.900 --> 2:24:50.940]  The black babies killed in the abortions clinics matter, right?
[2:24:50.940 --> 2:24:51.940]  Thought so.
[2:24:51.940 --> 2:24:57.740]  The black, the black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[2:24:57.740 --> 2:24:58.740]  Okay.
[2:24:58.740 --> 2:25:01.820]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter.
[2:25:01.820 --> 2:25:02.820]  Do they?
[2:25:02.820 --> 2:25:03.820]  Medical people.
[2:25:03.820 --> 2:25:07.180]  Do their lives matter?
[2:25:07.180 --> 2:25:10.020]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:11.020]  Huh?
[2:25:11.020 --> 2:25:12.020]  What's up?
[2:25:12.020 --> 2:25:13.020]  What's up?
[2:25:13.020 --> 2:25:15.020]  All for quiet now, aren't they?
[2:25:15.020 --> 2:25:16.020]  Uh huh.
[2:25:16.020 --> 2:25:19.700]  I don't care if we kill them in the womb, right?
[2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:23.140]  But you have a problem when we, you don't seem to really have a problem when we kill
[2:25:23.140 --> 2:25:24.140]  them on the streets.
[2:25:24.140 --> 2:25:25.140]  Yes.
[2:25:25.140 --> 2:25:27.260]  Well, we know they're the same issue.
[2:25:27.260 --> 2:25:32.660]  If we don't, if we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them
[2:25:32.660 --> 2:25:37.220]  and fight for them, our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[2:25:37.220 --> 2:25:40.300]  And there's the ultimate truth right there, ladies and gentlemen, and it just shows you
[2:25:40.300 --> 2:25:41.940]  how brainwashed the masses are.
[2:25:41.940 --> 2:25:43.020]  You say black lives matter.
[2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:44.100]  They are all.
[2:25:44.100 --> 2:25:48.540]  And then he's like, yeah, what about the black men killing black men like in Chicago?
[2:25:48.540 --> 2:25:49.540]  Silent.
[2:25:49.540 --> 2:25:50.780]  What about the black babies that are aborted?
[2:25:50.780 --> 2:25:51.780]  Silent.
[2:25:51.780 --> 2:25:53.100]  What about the black police that got murdered?
[2:25:53.100 --> 2:25:54.100]  Silent.
[2:25:54.100 --> 2:25:55.580]  These people don't care about black lives.
[2:25:55.580 --> 2:26:00.920]  They care about just the destruction of America and whatever front fraud group that they can
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:04.540]  use to bring that down on us.
[2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:07.580]  We're going to go to your phone calls real quick.
[2:26:07.580 --> 2:26:12.700]  Uh, I'm just sickened at what I'm seeing and the president said we get sick of winning.
[2:26:12.700 --> 2:26:16.340]  We realize that people who are defending themselves right now from these leftist mobs are all
[2:26:16.340 --> 2:26:17.340]  being arrested.
[2:26:17.340 --> 2:26:24.700]  Do you realize that makes me sick, including a man who was attacked for defending a statue.
[2:26:24.700 --> 2:26:26.200]  He shot one individual.
[2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:29.140]  He was violently attacked, but now he's the criminal.
[2:26:29.140 --> 2:26:31.940]  Uh, that's been happening nationwide.
[2:26:31.940 --> 2:26:35.100]  Harvard professor, defunding police is not a solution could cost thousands of black
[2:26:35.100 --> 2:26:36.100]  lives.
[2:26:36.100 --> 2:26:37.100]  It doesn't matter.
[2:26:37.100 --> 2:26:38.100]  Black lives matter.
[2:26:38.100 --> 2:26:39.100]  Doesn't care about black lives.
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:40.980]  It's a front group to destroy America.
[2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:45.540]  Scientists who said white racists are the enemy at a protest, leaves the protest and
[2:26:45.540 --> 2:26:50.260]  is then molested and murdered by a black man.
[2:26:50.260 --> 2:26:55.220]  Woke mobs destroying statues of anti-slavery figures.
[2:26:55.220 --> 2:27:01.620]  There's also some conflict happening around the world, India and China at the border there.
[2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:07.140]  North Africa as well and France and Seoul or Seoul and North Korea.
[2:27:07.140 --> 2:27:11.860]  There's some, uh, something, uh, was exploded over there, so, uh, it's just crazy protest
[2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:12.860]  everywhere.
[2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:13.860]  It's just, this is globalism folks.
[2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:14.860]  All right.
[2:27:14.860 --> 2:27:19.260]  Let's go to the callers and go to Ken in South Carolina.
[2:27:19.260 --> 2:27:20.260]  Go ahead, Ken.
[2:27:20.260 --> 2:27:23.260]  Hey, it was great to be with you.
[2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:24.260]  Thanks for calling.
[2:27:24.260 --> 2:27:26.700]  Um, I want to address the shooting at Atlanta, Georgia.
[2:27:26.700 --> 2:27:27.700]  I believe Ray Shard.
[2:27:27.700 --> 2:27:30.940]  I don't even remember his last name off hand because I'm, yeah, the guy that abused women
[2:27:30.940 --> 2:27:32.420]  and beat a child.
[2:27:32.420 --> 2:27:38.020]  Oh, no, no, he's an innocent bystander shot dead as he fled from cops.
[2:27:38.020 --> 2:27:39.020]  Oh, yeah.
[2:27:39.020 --> 2:27:41.020]  The guy that fought police and shot him with a taser.
[2:27:41.020 --> 2:27:44.700]  Well, I don't know if he landed that punch, but Doug gone and he was pretty good in the
[2:27:44.700 --> 2:27:48.580]  one cop try to jujitsu move, but didn't know how to execute a rear naked choke.
[2:27:48.580 --> 2:27:49.580]  But that's my point.
[2:27:49.580 --> 2:27:52.860]  I, I see a systematic problem on both sides of the coin.
[2:27:52.860 --> 2:27:56.460]  Now, personally, I've won a badge and a gun in a very short time and most of my arrests
[2:27:56.460 --> 2:27:57.460]  were drunk.
[2:27:57.460 --> 2:28:01.020]  So I fought the two police officers, even though they were respectful and nice.
[2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:04.180]  Before they were going to arrest him, they should have made sure that he knew he couldn't
[2:28:04.180 --> 2:28:07.500]  escape and they should have both had one arm ready to cuff and the cuff should have been
[2:28:07.500 --> 2:28:08.500]  hidden behind their back.
[2:28:08.500 --> 2:28:12.660]  That's what you do because nine out of 10 drunks, they're out of their mind and they're
[2:28:12.660 --> 2:28:14.580]  going to run or they're going to wrestle with you.
[2:28:14.580 --> 2:28:16.300]  So they were the worst calls we ever had.
[2:28:16.300 --> 2:28:20.340]  And that's mostly what I had to arrest 300 arrests, never had to draw my gun on those
[2:28:20.340 --> 2:28:22.620]  arrests and no problem.
[2:28:22.620 --> 2:28:23.620]  But here's the thing.
[2:28:23.620 --> 2:28:24.620]  Let me count the felonies.
[2:28:24.620 --> 2:28:28.500]  Oh, and he committed no less than four felonies at night.
[2:28:28.500 --> 2:28:34.140]  And people have to realize that we have empowered police with the privilege of shooting a fleeing
[2:28:34.140 --> 2:28:37.420]  felon in order to stop their escape.
[2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:38.420]  You know the law.
[2:28:38.420 --> 2:28:41.500]  You can't, you and I can't shoot a fleeing felon because we don't have a badge right
[2:28:41.500 --> 2:28:42.500]  now.
[2:28:42.500 --> 2:28:45.780]  So if someone commits a felony and breaks contact and runs, we have to give chase, but
[2:28:45.780 --> 2:28:47.060]  we cannot shoot them.
[2:28:47.060 --> 2:28:53.060]  But we give the special privilege of shooting felonies in order to stop an escaping felon
[2:28:53.060 --> 2:28:54.060]  to the police.
[2:28:54.060 --> 2:28:56.460]  That is a special privilege that they're given.
[2:28:56.460 --> 2:29:01.620]  So you cannot let people think, I don't care if they're white, black, brown, whatever.
[2:29:01.620 --> 2:29:06.020]  You can't brace a man or slap a man or punch a man with a gun, let alone commit the felony
[2:29:06.020 --> 2:29:11.900]  of disarming a police officer, assaulting felonious assault on the police officer, felonious
[2:29:11.900 --> 2:29:17.780]  resisting arrest and obviously felony DUI and then not expect something to happen.
[2:29:17.780 --> 2:29:19.460]  The shoot is righteous, whether we like it or not.
[2:29:19.460 --> 2:29:22.780]  Now personally, I witnessed shot the guy, but I'm Monday morning quarterbacking it.
[2:29:22.780 --> 2:29:26.100]  My thing is, if I have his wallet already, he can run all he wants to.
[2:29:26.100 --> 2:29:27.340]  I've got him on drunkenness.
[2:29:27.340 --> 2:29:28.340]  He can't get his car.
[2:29:28.340 --> 2:29:31.260]  So I'm going to let him go and we're going to go get four felonies against him and send
[2:29:31.260 --> 2:29:35.100]  the sheriff's department to go pick him up nice and peaceably when he's sober.
[2:29:35.100 --> 2:29:36.100]  And I would agree with that.
[2:29:36.100 --> 2:29:37.100]  The officer was within his right.
[2:29:37.100 --> 2:29:41.060]  He was within his authority, whether we like it or not.
[2:29:41.060 --> 2:29:46.540]  And that's just the use of deadly force written into law, which nobody seems to be talking
[2:29:46.540 --> 2:29:47.540]  about.
[2:29:47.540 --> 2:29:51.660]  But again, why do they sit here and if the media is going to make an event every time
[2:29:51.660 --> 2:29:55.700]  a black guy is shot by a white guy or a police officer, then this country is never going
[2:29:55.700 --> 2:29:57.980]  to stop having riots and protests, folks.
[2:29:57.980 --> 2:29:59.660]  And it looks like that's the media agenda.
[2:29:59.660 --> 2:30:05.140]  And if they, if they prop up Floyd as a martyr, who was the farthest thing from an example
[2:30:05.140 --> 2:30:11.580]  of a good man, in my opinion, and this guy who had a history of beating child's children
[2:30:11.580 --> 2:30:17.220]  and women, and now he's the next martyr, the media is not going to stop doing this.
[2:30:17.220 --> 2:30:18.900]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[2:30:18.900 --> 2:30:22.740]  Let's go to, let's take another Ken in Texas.
[2:30:22.740 --> 2:30:23.740]  Go ahead, Ken.
[2:30:23.740 --> 2:30:26.500]  Yo, what's up, boy?
[2:30:26.500 --> 2:30:27.500]  Go ahead.
[2:30:27.500 --> 2:30:28.500]  Yo, what's up, man?
[2:30:28.500 --> 2:30:33.420]  I just want to say it's like over here in Dallas, I don't think we have a lot of, like,
[2:30:33.420 --> 2:30:36.100]  I think we haven't had a lot of out of state influence.
[2:30:36.100 --> 2:30:42.780]  So I've been watching like the protest, trying to get violent, like in California, New York.
[2:30:42.780 --> 2:30:44.980]  I just say, man, like, what do we do down here?
[2:30:44.980 --> 2:30:49.860]  Because I feel like you get a lot of people, a lot of people with just the sleep really
[2:30:49.860 --> 2:30:52.940]  down over here in Dallas, man.
[2:30:52.940 --> 2:30:55.260]  So, I mean, what do states like that do?
[2:30:55.260 --> 2:31:00.380]  Well, I mean, like I said, if you're in this area, I would just suggest moving out.
[2:31:00.380 --> 2:31:01.980]  I mean, I don't know what else to tell you, man.
[2:31:01.980 --> 2:31:05.220]  The Democrats are going to let these people burn your city to the ground, and they're
[2:31:05.220 --> 2:31:08.500]  not going to let you open up a business or do anything because of COVID.
[2:31:08.500 --> 2:31:13.580]  So that's just the Democrat operating system right now.
[2:31:13.580 --> 2:31:18.220]  That's insane, dude.
[2:31:18.220 --> 2:31:19.820]  I mean, I don't know what to tell you, Ken.
[2:31:19.820 --> 2:31:20.980]  I mean, you can't defend yourself.
[2:31:20.980 --> 2:31:21.980]  You get arrested.
[2:31:21.980 --> 2:31:23.300]  You can't have your gun out.
[2:31:23.300 --> 2:31:24.300]  You get arrested.
[2:31:24.300 --> 2:31:27.780]  I mean, literally, people who are just defending themselves from these violent mobs are getting
[2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:29.980]  arrested.
[2:31:29.980 --> 2:31:30.980]  It's awful.
[2:31:30.980 --> 2:31:36.060]  I saw another picture of, they were claiming they were proud boys.
[2:31:36.060 --> 2:31:40.300]  I haven't proven that, it could just be a fake news report, but it was guys who were
[2:31:40.300 --> 2:31:45.140]  armed trying to protect the business from mob riots over the weekend, and all three
[2:31:45.140 --> 2:31:47.060]  of them got arrested.
[2:31:47.060 --> 2:31:48.060]  And then what happens?
[2:31:48.060 --> 2:31:51.620]  The mob and rioting continues to happen after you arrest the good guys.
[2:31:51.620 --> 2:31:52.620]  They're sick.
[2:31:52.620 --> 2:31:57.660]  And so, and so, again, what motivation does a cop have now to do his job?
[2:31:57.660 --> 2:32:01.740]  What motivation does a citizen have now to defend himself?
[2:32:01.740 --> 2:32:04.540]  You just got to get away from these Democrat hell holes, sadly.
[2:32:04.540 --> 2:32:08.260]  That's sadly, I don't know what else to say, Ken.
[2:32:08.260 --> 2:32:14.620]  The Democrats have turned their cities into complete hell holes and crap holes of no law,
[2:32:14.620 --> 2:32:19.300]  no justice, no order, just total chaos and death and rape, and that's everything the
[2:32:19.300 --> 2:32:20.300]  left is.
[2:32:20.300 --> 2:32:22.860]  Let's take one more call, Ryan in Oklahoma.
[2:32:22.860 --> 2:32:23.860]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[2:32:23.860 --> 2:32:27.140]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:32:27.140 --> 2:32:33.060]  I just want to, I know that Noam Chomsky's name is mud and all of these circles and the
[2:32:33.060 --> 2:32:38.340]  conservative circles, but back in 1988, him and Edward Herman wrote a book called Manufacturing
[2:32:38.340 --> 2:32:43.140]  Consent, and that's what's going on right now.
[2:32:43.140 --> 2:32:44.820]  That's exactly what's going on right now.
[2:32:44.820 --> 2:32:54.660]  The media's manufacturing consent to the public through quieting your voices and Alex's voices
[2:32:54.660 --> 2:32:57.580]  and not allowing for there to be choice in the media.
[2:32:57.580 --> 2:32:58.580]  Oh, yeah.
[2:32:58.580 --> 2:33:02.540]  And then showing George Floyd for three straight weeks, exactly.
[2:33:02.540 --> 2:33:07.580]  So, I wish that people would go and take a look at that, check out the five filters
[2:33:07.580 --> 2:33:11.740]  of editorial bias, and I would really like for Alex Jones, I'd love to know his take
[2:33:11.740 --> 2:33:15.020]  on it because this is fundamental info war.
[2:33:15.020 --> 2:33:18.060]  Well, and you know, that's kind of the craziest thing about this, Ryan.
[2:33:18.060 --> 2:33:19.060]  Thank you for the call.
[2:33:19.060 --> 2:33:20.060]  And I mentioned that yesterday.
[2:33:20.060 --> 2:33:27.740]  It's like, we have to, I mean, it's like he said, everything that's happening, it's
[2:33:27.740 --> 2:33:29.340]  like we've already predicted all this.
[2:33:29.340 --> 2:33:30.700]  We've already showed you the blueprint.
[2:33:30.700 --> 2:33:34.180]  We already told you all this was going to happen, so it's like, there's no point in
[2:33:34.180 --> 2:33:38.140]  us being redundant saying, hey, we told you, hey, this is how it's going.
[2:33:38.140 --> 2:33:42.300]  It's like, now we have to have the plan of action, what to do.
[2:33:42.300 --> 2:33:44.300]  And I don't want to call for a violent offensive front.
[2:33:44.300 --> 2:33:47.020]  I don't think we have to go there yet.
[2:33:47.020 --> 2:33:52.220]  Maybe inevitable, but I mean, right now, if you can get out of Democrat run cities, get
[2:33:52.220 --> 2:33:58.060]  out of inner cities, I mean, I'm serious, folks, you need to get as far away from progressive
[2:33:58.060 --> 2:33:59.580]  liberals and Democrats as possible.
[2:33:59.580 --> 2:34:05.060]  They are a direct threat to your life, your liberty, your pursuit of happiness, everything.
[2:34:05.060 --> 2:34:06.660]  These are dangerous people.
[2:34:06.660 --> 2:34:08.540]  They're mentally disturbed.
[2:34:08.540 --> 2:34:12.060]  They're being fumed and fueled by the media.
[2:34:12.060 --> 2:34:17.260]  It's a very dangerous powder keg that the Democrats and the media are lighting off.
[2:34:17.260 --> 2:34:18.260]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[2:34:18.260 --> 2:34:19.260]  You're on the air.
[2:34:19.260 --> 2:34:20.260]  Thanks for holding.
[2:34:20.260 --> 2:34:21.260]  Hello, can you hear me?
[2:34:21.260 --> 2:34:22.260]  I sure can, sir.
[2:34:22.260 --> 2:34:23.260]  Thank you.
[2:34:23.260 --> 2:34:24.260]  Hey, Alex.
[2:34:24.260 --> 2:34:27.500]  Before I start, man, I just, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[2:34:27.500 --> 2:34:28.900]  be talking right now with you, man.
[2:34:28.900 --> 2:34:30.900]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[2:34:30.900 --> 2:34:34.260]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in.
[2:34:34.260 --> 2:34:38.460]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive.
[2:34:38.460 --> 2:34:42.100]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us.
[2:34:42.100 --> 2:34:45.100]  We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[2:34:45.100 --> 2:34:51.380]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola, and I have lost weight because I stopped
[2:34:51.380 --> 2:34:54.140]  drinking all that sugar, and I just want to thank you for that, man.
[2:34:54.140 --> 2:34:58.780]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[2:34:58.780 --> 2:34:59.780]  there is.
[2:34:59.780 --> 2:35:02.060]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[2:35:02.060 --> 2:35:05.060]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a
[2:35:05.060 --> 2:35:08.420]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the
[2:35:08.420 --> 2:35:12.540]  best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your
[2:35:12.540 --> 2:35:13.540]  life better.
[2:35:13.540 --> 2:35:14.540]  So that means a lot to me.
[2:35:14.540 --> 2:35:15.540]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[2:35:15.540 --> 2:35:16.540]  We love you.
[2:35:16.540 --> 2:35:24.100]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System, the first of its kind, pure, nascent, atomic iodine
[2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:26.700]  that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[2:35:26.700 --> 2:35:32.780]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here, introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[2:35:32.780 --> 2:35:35.940]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[2:35:35.940 --> 2:35:40.020]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house, it's great at work, but this
[2:35:40.020 --> 2:35:45.220]  is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the throat
[2:35:45.220 --> 2:35:49.540]  and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[2:35:49.540 --> 2:35:53.140]  We're really excited about it, it's 33% off out of the gates.
[2:35:53.140 --> 2:35:57.620]  It was listeners' idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to
[2:35:57.620 --> 2:36:01.700]  the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers
[2:36:01.700 --> 2:36:05.180]  it to the body in a new and in some ways, even better way.
[2:36:05.180 --> 2:36:11.380]  Get your Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[2:36:11.380 --> 2:36:17.220]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[2:36:17.220 --> 2:36:22.700]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism, and so, populous movements are throwing the
[2:36:22.700 --> 2:36:25.620]  globalist out of their countries.
[2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:30.100]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division, and telling the people
[2:36:30.100 --> 2:36:35.460]  that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying
[2:36:35.460 --> 2:36:37.420]  essential services.
[2:36:37.420 --> 2:36:42.580]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the
[2:36:42.580 --> 2:36:45.660]  third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[2:36:45.660 --> 2:36:50.740]  They must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying they
[2:36:50.740 --> 2:36:52.260]  fund the police.
[2:36:52.260 --> 2:36:56.060]  The police have a lot of problems, we all have a lot of problems, but this is our government
[2:36:56.060 --> 2:37:00.660]  and our localist tabulary, and believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[2:37:00.660 --> 2:37:04.660]  they are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:09.260]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world, and they are orchestrating
[2:37:09.260 --> 2:37:10.580]  this entire thing.
[2:37:10.580 --> 2:37:26.620]  The people helping them are collaborators, and are idiots, and must be opposed, infowars.com.
[2:37:26.620 --> 2:37:48.180]  Thank you very much for watching this video, and don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe
[2:37:48.180 --> 2:38:16.860]  to the channel.
[2:38:18.180 --> 2:38:36.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:36.860 --> 2:38:42.100]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are about to hear from Alex Jones, and then Paul Joseph
[2:38:42.100 --> 2:38:45.060]  Watson will be taking over.
[2:38:45.060 --> 2:38:49.420]  Sure, infowarsstore.com, ladies and gentlemen, that's how all of this is possible.
[2:38:49.420 --> 2:38:54.420]  Our reporters on the ground in Seattle, all the live shows that we have here, from David
[2:38:54.420 --> 2:38:58.440]  Knight to Alex Jones to the War Room that I'm normally hosting, guest host today, Savannah
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:02.700]  Hernandez, to Band-Aught Video, to all the things we do, folks.
[2:39:02.700 --> 2:39:05.940]  It's all possible with your support at infowarsstore.com.
[2:39:05.940 --> 2:39:10.540]  So remember that, and remember folks, the emergency food still in stock.
[2:39:10.540 --> 2:39:14.780]  The Democrats and the deep state and the globalists are going to launch another big
[2:39:14.780 --> 2:39:19.460]  devastating event against this country, and there's going to be a rush on storeable food.
[2:39:19.460 --> 2:39:20.900]  There is zero doubt about that.
[2:39:20.900 --> 2:39:28.060]  So get in your orders for emergency storeable food at infowarsstore.com before another rush
[2:39:28.060 --> 2:39:34.260]  happens, whether it's a second fake pandemic, a real one, riots and looting all around the
[2:39:34.260 --> 2:39:35.600]  United States.
[2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:38.340]  Get prepared with emergency storeable food at infowarsstore.com.
[2:39:38.340 --> 2:39:44.660]  Now here, Alex Jones.
[2:39:44.660 --> 2:39:49.900]  The megacorporations that are establishing planetary world government want to destroy
[2:39:49.900 --> 2:39:55.580]  the model of open free societies because it competes with their centralized model.
[2:39:55.580 --> 2:39:58.620]  They never wanted to merge the planet and create a Kumbaya system.
[2:39:58.620 --> 2:40:07.060]  They actually plan to use the three planetary regions with 10 subregions to further balkanize
[2:40:07.060 --> 2:40:13.700]  what was left of the once great nation states by exacerbating ethnic, religious and historical
[2:40:13.700 --> 2:40:14.700]  fissures.
[2:40:14.700 --> 2:40:22.140]  They talk about, when they finally complete this, having armored citadels that are sovereign
[2:40:22.140 --> 2:40:27.740]  states, corporate states above the law, similar to what the Vatican is, or the city of London,
[2:40:27.740 --> 2:40:29.220]  financial center within London.
[2:40:29.220 --> 2:40:39.240]  There they will be high tech reservations with huge walls, combat drones, very little
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:43.580]  need for even a human security force, and outside of it will be everybody else.
[2:40:43.580 --> 2:40:46.500]  And this is how the globalists have already set up a corporate world government.
[2:40:46.500 --> 2:40:50.820]  They're transferring all the money, all the energy, all the science through the IMF and
[2:40:50.820 --> 2:40:55.540]  World Bank and all these scams they're running on record to vertically integrate things as
[2:40:55.540 --> 2:40:57.220]  a form of war.
[2:40:57.220 --> 2:41:02.780]  They're not just greedily establishing this because they want all of the quote resources
[2:41:02.780 --> 2:41:09.860]  so that they personally are richer or have a higher number of digits in their bank account.
[2:41:09.860 --> 2:41:15.260]  It's done so they can economically dictate your total surrender.
[2:41:15.260 --> 2:41:20.260]  They are erasing the social contract of the renaissance that made us fat, dumb and happy.
[2:41:20.260 --> 2:41:25.260]  They've decided under social Darwinism that we don't deserve all of this because we've
[2:41:25.260 --> 2:41:26.580]  become fat, dumb and happy.
[2:41:26.580 --> 2:41:31.780]  So they're just going to grease the skids for us to slide over the edge into oblivion.
[2:41:31.780 --> 2:41:35.580]  You can look it all up for yourself.
[2:41:35.580 --> 2:41:38.980]  My film end game, blueprint for global enslavement, lays it out.
[2:41:38.980 --> 2:41:42.580]  We've made hundreds and hundreds of other special reports and articles showing their
[2:41:42.580 --> 2:41:44.900]  own quotes and their own statements.
[2:41:44.900 --> 2:41:51.820]  That's how I was able 20 plus years ago to lay out what the future would look like because
[2:41:51.820 --> 2:41:57.620]  I was reading you their own white papers and their own economic theories and their own
[2:41:57.620 --> 2:41:58.900]  stated goals.
[2:41:58.900 --> 2:42:03.020]  Well, now they've brought us to where they said they would 20 years ago and if they bring
[2:42:03.020 --> 2:42:07.620]  us the next few legs, there aren't going to be many people left and that's what the
[2:42:07.620 --> 2:42:11.980]  lockdowns are for, they're training you to behave yourself and see nothing happen.
[2:42:11.980 --> 2:42:13.820]  It wasn't a big deal.
[2:42:13.820 --> 2:42:20.700]  And then progressively more deadly, real bio weapons are released, but you behave and
[2:42:20.700 --> 2:42:23.500]  sit in your home and die.
[2:42:23.500 --> 2:42:26.940]  And it's not just going to be bioattacks, it's going to be electrochemical, it's going
[2:42:26.940 --> 2:42:34.500]  to be electromagnetic, it's going to be chemical, it's going to be radiological and they'll
[2:42:34.500 --> 2:42:36.660]  have these overlapping fields of fire.
[2:42:36.660 --> 2:42:41.940]  They will then introduce new diseases, new treatment regimes through the UN that have
[2:42:41.940 --> 2:42:46.500]  nothing to do with what you're actually getting sick from because it'll actually be a binary
[2:42:46.500 --> 2:42:51.180]  or even more than two different things that are combined to create what they've actually
[2:42:51.180 --> 2:42:52.180]  hit you with.
[2:42:52.180 --> 2:42:56.940]  And then also, they will also have a treatment regimen just like with HIV or COVID-19 that
[2:42:56.940 --> 2:42:59.780]  actually exacerbates it or makes it worse or actually kills you.
[2:42:59.780 --> 2:43:06.420]  And of course, it was fouchy, very evil, eugenicist who oversaw the HIV bio weapon rollout response
[2:43:06.420 --> 2:43:12.540]  and the AZT and all the big drugs that actually killed people, not the HIV virus and of course
[2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:15.060]  all of that came out as well.
[2:43:15.060 --> 2:43:21.500]  They know what they're doing and they can be defeated though because psychotics and their
[2:43:21.500 --> 2:43:26.700]  servant sociopaths are very OCD and follow the same patterns over and over again and
[2:43:26.700 --> 2:43:34.420]  also like to codify their battle plans in very thinly veiled reports and drills and
[2:43:34.420 --> 2:43:39.060]  tabletop exercises and then real world exercises and that's what Gates has said, Bill Gates
[2:43:39.060 --> 2:43:44.260]  is that this is event 201, this is really just a drill.
[2:43:44.260 --> 2:43:50.340]  He said that on Colbert, not even veiled a few months ago, but that the bigger ones
[2:43:50.340 --> 2:43:54.780]  are coming and of course will be the savior there and dictate to us how we live and how
[2:43:54.780 --> 2:43:55.860]  we behave.
[2:43:55.860 --> 2:44:01.540]  As for black lives matter, it doesn't matter if it's 12, 14 black men that questionably
[2:44:01.540 --> 2:44:05.380]  get killed by the cops every year in the United States, it doesn't matter if that's one of
[2:44:05.380 --> 2:44:09.940]  the rarest forms of death for black men, the left knows that under what's left of America's
[2:44:09.940 --> 2:44:17.500]  Christian ethos that we like to be guilty and so the new religion is hating ourselves
[2:44:17.500 --> 2:44:21.700]  and prostrating ourselves and showing that we're bad and saying, you know, just agree
[2:44:21.700 --> 2:44:22.940]  that black lives matter.
[2:44:22.940 --> 2:44:27.420]  What you're really agreeing to is Planned Parenthood and George Soros that fund black
[2:44:27.420 --> 2:44:30.180]  lives matter, they're actually carrying out the extermination of black people.
[2:44:30.180 --> 2:44:32.580]  It's the perfect obscene cover.
[2:44:32.580 --> 2:44:37.700]  Meanwhile, the Clintons oversaw the Rwandan massacre where over a million African Christians
[2:44:37.700 --> 2:44:42.420]  were killed and the UN didn't just oversee it, it turned out they actually directed and
[2:44:42.420 --> 2:44:47.260]  did most the massacring themselves as they were bringing in other African tribes that
[2:44:47.260 --> 2:44:49.860]  were anti-Christian and could be controlled by the United Nations.
[2:44:49.860 --> 2:44:54.140]  They were destroying one of the only stable governments in Africa that black Christians
[2:44:54.140 --> 2:44:58.380]  had set up because that's the name of the game, destabilization, destruction, but oh,
[2:44:58.380 --> 2:45:03.180]  when I just talk about 800,000 to a million and a half, the numbers vary of dead black
[2:45:03.180 --> 2:45:04.180]  people.
[2:45:04.180 --> 2:45:06.620]  That's just, oh, come on, John, you're a white supremacist.
[2:45:06.620 --> 2:45:08.580]  That's the middle programming.
[2:45:08.580 --> 2:45:11.980]  They won't go show you the videos and photos of UN troops raping children or burning over
[2:45:11.980 --> 2:45:12.980]  fires.
[2:45:12.980 --> 2:45:16.940]  I mean, I made a film, Exposed at America's Robot Design, but see, Google doesn't want
[2:45:16.940 --> 2:45:19.180]  you to see it, so it's banned.
[2:45:19.180 --> 2:45:22.220]  Just like Tim Cook gives 100 million dollars or pledges it to black lives matter, he needs
[2:45:22.220 --> 2:45:26.260]  revolution in America and then what does Tim Cook do?
[2:45:26.260 --> 2:45:31.380]  He runs the worst factories, contracts them out in China with 3 million Uighurs building
[2:45:31.380 --> 2:45:34.260]  many of the Apple components and he knows damn well what he's doing.
[2:45:34.260 --> 2:45:35.260]  He loves it.
[2:45:35.260 --> 2:45:39.980]  Communist China a few years ago said, would you pay workers a little bit more and maybe
[2:45:39.980 --> 2:45:41.740]  they'd actually have houses to live in?
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:46.540]  He said, no, we'll leave, but see it's okay because Tim Cook's trendy and he talks with
[2:45:46.540 --> 2:45:54.340]  a lisp and as long as you talk with a lisp, it's all a camouflage cover for these psychotic
[2:45:54.340 --> 2:45:55.660]  monsters.
[2:45:55.660 --> 2:45:59.540]  School psychos, the high functioning ones always have a gimmick.
[2:45:59.540 --> 2:46:04.180]  Oh, they're driving an ice cream truck, oh, they've got a puppy, oh, they've got a little
[2:46:04.180 --> 2:46:09.660]  yellow Volkswagen, they're not threatening, we'd like to take you for a Coca-Cola young
[2:46:09.660 --> 2:46:14.380]  16-year-old girl, well, they just do it on a mass scale.
[2:46:14.380 --> 2:46:19.460]  They're not trolling like some of the people you've seen at Penn State, you know, they're
[2:46:19.460 --> 2:46:24.620]  at the elementary school, no, no, no, these are the individuals that do this on a mass
[2:46:24.620 --> 2:46:31.740]  scale scientifically and then have armies of lawyers and politicians and PR firms roll
[2:46:31.740 --> 2:46:36.820]  it out with a cover story of why they're doing it, but you scratch the surface, they're cold
[2:46:36.820 --> 2:46:37.820]  blooded chillers.
[2:46:37.820 --> 2:46:43.940]  But the good news is Congressman Scalise has sent letters that they're starting an investigation
[2:46:43.940 --> 2:46:45.660]  to these Democrat governors.
[2:46:45.660 --> 2:46:51.340]  Now it's Tim confirmed they were not told by Trump, they were not told by his administration
[2:46:51.340 --> 2:46:52.700]  to put people in nursing homes.
[2:46:52.700 --> 2:46:57.820]  They were following of the UN directive of the WHO because they knew they had to hit
[2:46:57.820 --> 2:47:02.500]  some real death numbers, so they could put people with pneumonia and with flus who also
[2:47:02.500 --> 2:47:05.380]  test positive for COVID, the tests that Gates put out are fraud, he's been shut down with
[2:47:05.380 --> 2:47:09.380]  the FDA for it, just total proof, see right there, even the FDA, that he pretty much controls
[2:47:09.380 --> 2:47:13.140]  still shut his ass down at such fraud because he was creating a stereo with all his fake
[2:47:13.140 --> 2:47:14.140]  tests.
[2:47:14.140 --> 2:47:15.140]  His tests are sheltered by the millions.
[2:47:15.140 --> 2:47:17.380]  They had to send people that were actually sick in nursing homes knowing it's a death
[2:47:17.380 --> 2:47:23.540]  sentence, the default position is never allow someone into a nursing home who actually doesn't
[2:47:23.540 --> 2:47:24.540]  need the nursing.
[2:47:24.540 --> 2:47:29.020]  Remember, healthy patients put the tested positive, oh, but they've got a virus, stick
[2:47:29.020 --> 2:47:31.940]  them in there, bring a bunch of people in there, bring a bunch of homeless people and
[2:47:31.940 --> 2:47:37.100]  folks in that have got a whole bunch of different bacteria and viruses and kill off the old
[2:47:37.100 --> 2:47:41.700]  folks, then slap COVID on it and the hospitals and nursing homes will go along with it because
[2:47:41.700 --> 2:47:46.700]  they're getting an extra 52 plus grand on average for carrying out the mafia hit.
[2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:50.260]  And the best hit men, you know, kill people for that type of money.
[2:47:50.260 --> 2:47:54.300]  So this is hit man money, now 60,000 people that died in the nursing homes.
[2:47:54.300 --> 2:47:58.980]  So think about the diabolical premeditated nature of them not letting their families
[2:47:58.980 --> 2:48:02.460]  in to see them saying you might have something but bringing people in that they knew were
[2:48:02.460 --> 2:48:03.460]  positive.
[2:48:03.460 --> 2:48:07.140]  Those are in the same state, same protocols, same buildings, and they have monsters funded
[2:48:07.140 --> 2:48:12.620]  by Soros and put into power by the New York Attorney General, Leticia James, who ordered
[2:48:12.620 --> 2:48:17.540]  and threatened to arrest any nursing home owners or directors that didn't submit and
[2:48:17.540 --> 2:48:21.180]  didn't join her in the criminal activity and in the murder.
[2:48:21.180 --> 2:48:26.900]  And the premeditation goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[2:48:26.900 --> 2:48:31.380]  and it's all coordinated, it's all in battle plans, it's all drawn up by these sick, evil
[2:48:31.380 --> 2:48:35.860]  people by Gates who's always out there telling you, oh, you know, kill an old lady and you
[2:48:35.860 --> 2:48:39.020]  can hire 10 teachers, which is all just made up, baloney as well.
[2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:41.820]  He's teaching you that you get ahead by others dying.
[2:48:41.820 --> 2:48:42.820]  It's eugenics.
[2:48:42.820 --> 2:48:43.820]  It's death cult programming.
[2:48:43.820 --> 2:48:46.820]  All right, folks, back to the live transmission.
[2:48:46.820 --> 2:48:48.100]  Got more special reports coming up.
[2:48:48.100 --> 2:48:49.860]  They're extremely critical.
[2:48:49.860 --> 2:48:51.220]  Please spread the word about the live transmission.
[2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:53.260]  We can overpower these monsters, but you've got to get excited.
[2:48:53.260 --> 2:48:56.180]  You've got to get aggressive and you've got to realize you are the Paul Revere.
[2:48:56.180 --> 2:48:57.180]  That's not rhetoric.
[2:48:57.180 --> 2:48:58.180]  That's fact.
[2:48:58.180 --> 2:48:59.540]  You are just as important as this broadcast.
[2:48:59.540 --> 2:49:00.540]  You don't take action.
[2:49:00.540 --> 2:49:01.540]  They win.
[2:49:01.540 --> 2:49:02.540]  You want them to win.
[2:49:02.540 --> 2:49:03.540]  Get aggressive.
[2:49:03.540 --> 2:49:05.860]  Spread the word by any means legally necessary.
[2:49:05.860 --> 2:49:06.860]  Back to the live transmission.
[2:49:06.860 --> 2:49:11.620]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[2:49:11.620 --> 2:49:15.260]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[2:49:15.260 --> 2:49:19.540]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[2:49:19.540 --> 2:49:20.540]  world.
[2:49:20.540 --> 2:49:25.740]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[2:49:25.740 --> 2:49:26.740]  to be.
[2:49:26.740 --> 2:49:31.860]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[2:49:31.860 --> 2:49:32.860]  economy.
[2:49:32.860 --> 2:49:33.860]  That's what we've always said.
[2:49:33.860 --> 2:49:38.060]  It's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want
[2:49:38.060 --> 2:49:41.580]  to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[2:49:41.580 --> 2:49:44.020]  They've admitted all of this.
[2:49:44.020 --> 2:49:49.620]  So remember, how does infall wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able
[2:49:49.620 --> 2:49:52.060]  to predict things before they happen?
[2:49:52.060 --> 2:49:56.900]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes, it's dystopic
[2:49:56.900 --> 2:49:58.340]  and yes, it's scary.
[2:49:58.340 --> 2:50:02.500]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[2:50:02.500 --> 2:50:13.660]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[2:50:13.660 --> 2:50:19.300]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax
[2:50:19.300 --> 2:50:25.340]  and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[2:50:25.340 --> 2:50:28.340]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[2:50:28.340 --> 2:50:33.300]  I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even
[2:50:33.300 --> 2:50:34.580]  a bigger race war.
[2:50:34.580 --> 2:50:39.500]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong.
[2:50:39.500 --> 2:50:42.940]  You name it, the globalists are attacking on every front.
[2:50:42.940 --> 2:50:47.220]  That's why now, more than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor infall wars off
[2:50:47.220 --> 2:50:52.220]  the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation, they didn't want the
[2:50:52.220 --> 2:50:54.260]  people's voice to still be on air.
[2:50:54.260 --> 2:50:58.460]  Thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[2:50:58.460 --> 2:51:04.500]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now, more than ever, InfallWars.com
[2:51:04.500 --> 2:51:28.500]  lives.
[2:51:28.500 --> 2:51:45.860]  As you know, Chaz, the Seattle Autonomous Protest Zone, the occupied area of downtown
[2:51:45.860 --> 2:51:52.380]  Seattle, which is occupied by armed left-wing extremists and Black Lives Matter demonstrators,
[2:51:52.380 --> 2:51:58.860]  has seen a spate of violence, 300% increase in violent crime according to the police.
[2:51:58.860 --> 2:52:03.340]  People who live nearby say they hear screams like they've never heard screams before.
[2:52:03.340 --> 2:52:06.260]  These are not the screams of protesters.
[2:52:06.260 --> 2:52:08.340]  We've seen violent attacks.
[2:52:08.340 --> 2:52:12.980]  We've seen teenagers being handed assault rifles, completely illegal.
[2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:15.020]  We've seen mob justice.
[2:52:15.020 --> 2:52:16.660]  We've seen routine fights.
[2:52:16.660 --> 2:52:21.060]  We've seen people chase down the street being accused of theft, whether they've burgled
[2:52:21.060 --> 2:52:22.720]  anyone or not.
[2:52:22.720 --> 2:52:28.180]  People dragged to the floor, choked out, of course, the police response times have tripled
[2:52:28.180 --> 2:52:32.620]  if they're even able to get near the area at all.
[2:52:32.620 --> 2:52:36.140]  It's basically a mobocracy of left-wing extremists.
[2:52:36.140 --> 2:52:42.060]  They literally tried to engage in a game of dodgeball a couple of nights ago, and they
[2:52:42.060 --> 2:52:47.740]  couldn't even get through a game of dodgeball without ending in a massive fight.
[2:52:47.740 --> 2:52:51.620]  We see violence on a daily basis, and how does the media report it?
[2:52:51.620 --> 2:52:58.180]  Well, of course, the mayor of Seattle got up on CNN and said it was peaceful, that it
[2:52:58.180 --> 2:53:03.300]  was not an armed takeover despite numerous video footage and images showing that that's
[2:53:03.300 --> 2:53:04.540]  exactly what it was.
[2:53:04.540 --> 2:53:09.300]  Of course, the first thing they did was build a wall to keep anyone out they didn't like.
[2:53:09.300 --> 2:53:14.460]  That hasn't really worked very well, because every day at this point, people march through
[2:53:14.460 --> 2:53:18.180]  the area carrying American flags and almost get lynched.
[2:53:18.180 --> 2:53:23.940]  CNN said it was peaceful, numerous TikTok bloggers have said it's peaceful, and now this
[2:53:23.940 --> 2:53:30.100]  from Bloomberg Business Week, community not anarchy inside Seattle's protest zone.
[2:53:30.100 --> 2:53:34.500]  The cops are gone, but the area hasn't devolved into violent disorder, as President Trump
[2:53:34.500 --> 2:53:35.500]  Trump claims.
[2:53:35.500 --> 2:53:40.180]  Either you're blind or you're lying, because that's exactly what happened.
[2:53:40.180 --> 2:53:44.380]  How many videos do we need to see of people getting dragged to the ground, punched in
[2:53:44.380 --> 2:53:45.380]  the face?
[2:53:45.380 --> 2:53:49.860]  And these aren't even Trump people, these aren't right-wing infiltrators, these are
[2:53:49.860 --> 2:53:52.700]  their own people that they're beating up on a daily basis.
[2:53:52.700 --> 2:53:58.420]  Oh, but it's so peaceful, rape has gone through the roof, people are hearing the screams of
[2:53:58.420 --> 2:54:03.580]  women being sexually assaulted, but it's a summer of love, according to the mayor of
[2:54:03.580 --> 2:54:05.620]  Seattle, and she wouldn't lie to you at all, would she?
[2:54:05.620 --> 2:54:10.660]  And they're even targeting her, even though she's fully on board with them.
[2:54:10.660 --> 2:54:17.220]  Meanwhile, CNN has compiled a list of unforgivable statues and place names, obviously painting
[2:54:17.220 --> 2:54:21.860]  a giant target on their back for the mob to drag them down to.
[2:54:21.860 --> 2:54:26.180]  I mean, it's not enough that dozens of people have already died as a result of these riots,
[2:54:26.180 --> 2:54:31.020]  it's not enough that a statue literally landed on somebody's head and put him in a coma.
[2:54:31.020 --> 2:54:35.340]  No, they want more chaos, they want more bedlam.
[2:54:35.340 --> 2:54:39.980]  Knockout game, 92-year-old woman assaulted in broad daylight in Manhattan, African American
[2:54:39.980 --> 2:54:45.060]  male just knocks out a 92-year-old white woman with a stroller on the street, is the news
[2:54:45.060 --> 2:54:51.500]  media even reporting it, barely if at all, not the right narrative.
[2:54:51.500 --> 2:54:55.340]  Rioters tearing down statue, chase man down the street and attack him, man shoots a silent
[2:54:55.340 --> 2:55:00.580]  and self-defense, it obviously was self-defense, again, that's not getting much play in the
[2:55:00.580 --> 2:55:04.500]  media, despite the fact you would think that they could hijack that, being the narrative
[2:55:04.500 --> 2:55:11.580]  of this random militia man they claim, shooting up Black Lives Matter protesters, you think
[2:55:11.580 --> 2:55:16.540]  they'd be on top of that, well, not really, because he's viciously attacked in the moments
[2:55:16.540 --> 2:55:21.500]  before he shoots at them, not the brightest idea to try and viciously assault somebody
[2:55:21.500 --> 2:55:25.180]  who is armed with a gun, but again, these aren't the brightest people.
[2:55:25.180 --> 2:55:29.620]  Olympia Mayor who supported Black Lives Matter calls protest vandalism at her home domestic
[2:55:29.620 --> 2:55:34.380]  terrorism, gonna get into that, it's absolutely hilarious.
[2:55:34.380 --> 2:55:39.140]  The Boston Mayor is saying he's gonna remove a statue of Abraham Lincoln, the man who literally
[2:55:39.140 --> 2:55:41.980]  fought a war to end slavery.
[2:55:41.980 --> 2:55:45.940]  Woke mobs are now destroying statues, are leading anti-slavery figures, they don't care because
[2:55:45.940 --> 2:55:51.300]  it's not about slavery, it's about overthrowing America, it's not about the Confederacy, it's
[2:55:51.300 --> 2:55:53.380]  about America.
[2:55:53.380 --> 2:55:58.340]  Police officer shot in the head during BLM protest is paralyzed from the neck down, again,
[2:55:58.340 --> 2:56:03.700]  not too many mainstream media headlines about him, and now de Blasio in New York is literally
[2:56:03.700 --> 2:56:08.420]  welding shut gates and Jewish areas because there's not kids in there, meanwhile, advocating
[2:56:08.420 --> 2:56:13.700]  mass gatherings of tens of thousands of people, we'll get into it all on the other side, summit.news.go
[2:56:13.700 --> 2:56:15.300]  way.
[2:56:15.300 --> 2:56:20.420]  It's finally here, introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic
[2:56:20.420 --> 2:56:21.420]  iodine.
[2:56:21.420 --> 2:56:25.660]  Listers have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive
[2:56:25.660 --> 2:56:27.860]  deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[2:56:27.860 --> 2:56:29.820]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[2:56:29.820 --> 2:56:34.460]  The proprietary new aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine
[2:56:34.460 --> 2:56:38.780]  crystals from 7,000 feet below the earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[2:56:38.780 --> 2:56:42.940]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power
[2:56:42.940 --> 2:56:46.980]  of true nascent iodine working for my body, I can personally feel the difference.
[2:56:46.980 --> 2:56:51.220]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy
[2:56:51.220 --> 2:56:55.420]  metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[2:56:55.420 --> 2:56:59.980]  You may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[2:56:59.980 --> 2:57:04.420]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine
[2:57:04.420 --> 2:57:05.420]  today.
[2:57:05.420 --> 2:57:10.780]  Get the new survival shield X2 spray for 33% off at infowarstore.com before we sell out
[2:57:10.780 --> 2:57:12.460]  of our new limited first shipment.
[2:57:12.460 --> 2:57:30.180]  Transmuting worldwide from the summit.newstudiosintheunitedkingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:57:30.180 --> 2:57:36.260]  So as you know, last Monday, left wing extremists took over an area of downtown Seattle and
[2:57:36.260 --> 2:57:37.740]  named it Chazz.
[2:57:37.740 --> 2:57:43.580]  They later renamed it to Chop because they wanted to send a message that anyone who resisted
[2:57:43.580 --> 2:57:45.940]  as people did in the French Revolution.
[2:57:45.940 --> 2:57:50.980]  That's how they would be dealt with by getting the chop literally by getting their heads
[2:57:50.980 --> 2:57:51.980]  chopped off.
[2:57:51.980 --> 2:57:54.140]  But CNN says it's peaceful.
[2:57:54.140 --> 2:57:56.700]  The mayor of Seattle says it's a summer of love.
[2:57:56.700 --> 2:58:04.180]  We've literally got armed SoundCloud rappers and their gang members patrolling this area
[2:58:04.180 --> 2:58:10.380]  armed with semi-automatics, handing out semi-automatics to teenagers, calling it chop.
[2:58:10.380 --> 2:58:13.980]  They have fights every night with each other.
[2:58:13.980 --> 2:58:17.940]  Whenever anyone tries to walk through there with an American flag or a MAGA hat, they
[2:58:17.940 --> 2:58:20.140]  almost get lynched.
[2:58:20.140 --> 2:58:23.180]  The routine fights again with each other every single night.
[2:58:23.180 --> 2:58:28.660]  There was a Christian preacher who was dragged to the ground and choked out.
[2:58:28.660 --> 2:58:35.260]  The crime is up 300% residents who live in the area, there was a guy who did an interview
[2:58:35.260 --> 2:58:40.460]  with the Daily Caller who said this, so that they hear screams like they've never heard
[2:58:40.460 --> 2:58:41.460]  screams before.
[2:58:41.460 --> 2:58:45.540]  They hear gunshots in the night like they've never heard before.
[2:58:45.540 --> 2:58:51.540]  This is basically turning into Chicago on steroids, Chirac on steroids.
[2:58:51.540 --> 2:58:52.700]  They've got mob justice.
[2:58:52.700 --> 2:58:56.820]  They chase people down the street to accuse the best whether they are or not.
[2:58:56.820 --> 2:58:59.820]  They beat them up on many occasions.
[2:58:59.820 --> 2:59:00.900]  They beat each other up.
[2:59:00.900 --> 2:59:02.340]  This is a mobocracy.
[2:59:02.340 --> 2:59:04.500]  This is absolute bedlam.
[2:59:04.500 --> 2:59:08.140]  The police can't even get near it on many occasions.
[2:59:08.140 --> 2:59:10.260]  People are overdosing on drugs.
[2:59:10.260 --> 2:59:13.420]  They're lucky to get out of there as you see here from the clip.
[2:59:13.420 --> 2:59:17.260]  Guy walked through with a MAGA hat, almost got lynched.
[2:59:17.260 --> 2:59:19.540]  How's the media reporting it?
[2:59:19.540 --> 2:59:23.500]  Well, here's a headline from Bloomberg Business Week.
[2:59:23.500 --> 2:59:27.340]  See, not anarchy inside Seattle's protest zone.
[2:59:27.340 --> 2:59:32.540]  The cops are gone, but the area hasn't devolved into violent disorder as President Trump claims.
[2:59:32.540 --> 2:59:34.340]  Yes, it has.
[2:59:34.340 --> 2:59:39.380]  How many videos do we need to see if people get punched in the face, dragged off the stage,
[2:59:39.380 --> 2:59:41.260]  dragged to the ground?
[2:59:41.260 --> 2:59:46.340]  Most of the violence is protestor on protester.
[2:59:46.340 --> 2:59:49.500]  In fact, there's a clip in my latest video.
[2:59:49.500 --> 2:59:54.420]  It shows how it's devolved not only into a violent communist dystopia, but also a kind
[2:59:54.420 --> 3:00:00.180]  of Lord of the Flies anarchy, where they're bickering amongst each other.
[3:00:00.180 --> 3:00:04.220]  They can't even get a sentence out without somebody bickering and arguing and disagreeing
[3:00:04.220 --> 3:00:07.220]  and them screaming at each other on a regular basis.
[3:00:07.220 --> 3:00:11.700]  If this is their communist utopia, I say, let them get on with it.
[3:00:11.700 --> 3:00:13.420]  Don't send the police back in.
[3:00:13.420 --> 3:00:16.300]  Let it devolve into absolute bedlam and anarchy.
[3:00:16.300 --> 3:00:20.140]  They keep complaining about how they can't get enough food in there.
[3:00:20.140 --> 3:00:23.940]  This is their attempt at gardening, just a giant mound of dirt.
[3:00:23.940 --> 3:00:26.820]  I say, leave them to it.
[3:00:26.820 --> 3:00:30.340]  But according to the media, it's going great.
[3:00:30.340 --> 3:00:33.980]  This article says, the Dasha Turner liked what she saw.
[3:00:33.980 --> 3:00:37.380]  Looking at the vegetable garden that had just been planted, she said she felt good about
[3:00:37.380 --> 3:00:40.380]  her decision to bring her six-year-old daughter.
[3:00:40.380 --> 3:00:42.380]  You're bringing your daughter to this.
[3:00:42.380 --> 3:00:47.900]  A part of Seattle that President Trump recently described as being taken over by ugly anarchists,
[3:00:47.900 --> 3:00:51.820]  which is precisely what happened, and they are ugly as well, by the way.
[3:00:51.820 --> 3:00:56.260]  On Sunday, the park and many surrounding blocks in the city's capital-ill neighborhood
[3:00:56.260 --> 3:00:58.220]  have been turned over to art.
[3:00:58.220 --> 3:01:02.940]  What happens is, all these mainstream journalists and all these TikTok bloggers and all these
[3:01:02.940 --> 3:01:11.460]  idiot blue checkmarks go there for like two hours in the day, like 12 midday to 2 p.m.
[3:01:11.460 --> 3:01:15.100]  and they're not all screaming at each other, drunk and beating each other up.
[3:01:15.100 --> 3:01:20.540]  They walk around the main bit, the safest bit, for about an hour and a half.
[3:01:20.540 --> 3:01:24.540]  They come along and say, oh, it's so peaceful, it's just like a big farmer's market.
[3:01:24.540 --> 3:01:31.660]  As soon as night falls, they're all trying to break into whatever business is left open.
[3:01:31.660 --> 3:01:36.860]  Any business that dares to remain open, that even virtue signals with all the BLM signs
[3:01:36.860 --> 3:01:40.860]  in the window, now they're getting smashed up.
[3:01:40.860 --> 3:01:46.220]  Groming mobs handing out semi-automatic guns to teenagers, completely illegal.
[3:01:46.220 --> 3:01:51.380]  Again, they had a dodgeball game, which ended up in a massive argument, punching each other
[3:01:51.380 --> 3:01:52.380]  in the face.
[3:01:52.380 --> 3:01:56.500]  Oh, but it's peaceful, it's just like a giant farmer's market.
[3:01:56.500 --> 3:01:59.580]  You can take your kids.
[3:01:59.580 --> 3:02:04.180]  People lounged on the ball fields as the DJ spun records.
[3:02:04.180 --> 3:02:07.460]  Parents pushed baby strollers, there was more than one labradoodle.
[3:02:07.460 --> 3:02:08.460]  Nowhere to be found.
[3:02:08.460 --> 3:02:09.460]  The police.
[3:02:09.460 --> 3:02:13.900]  There's literally graffiti on every wall saying, kill the police, so peaceful.
[3:02:13.900 --> 3:02:15.820]  So tolerant.
[3:02:15.820 --> 3:02:19.220]  This is what a true community looks like, said Turner.
[3:02:19.220 --> 3:02:21.540]  This is why we're a threat to President Trump.
[3:02:21.540 --> 3:02:23.780]  You're a threat to each other.
[3:02:23.780 --> 3:02:26.900]  People literally shooting at each other.
[3:02:26.900 --> 3:02:29.300]  Hasn't somebody died already as well?
[3:02:29.300 --> 3:02:33.500]  Since the Seattle Police Department vacated its East precinct last week, vacated, they
[3:02:33.500 --> 3:02:37.540]  were literally chased out of there by a violent mob.
[3:02:37.540 --> 3:02:43.140]  The area is taken on the vibe of a street festival.
[3:02:43.140 --> 3:02:47.940]  They literally give speeches saying people who anger us, people who are dissidents, will
[3:02:47.940 --> 3:02:49.820]  get their heads chopped off.
[3:02:49.820 --> 3:02:54.700]  It's a street festival headline.
[3:02:54.700 --> 3:02:59.900]  Chas occupiers suggest rounding up all the white people into work brigades.
[3:02:59.900 --> 3:03:00.900]  What if they don't want to?
[3:03:00.900 --> 3:03:03.580]  Well, just maybe just do what happened in the French Revolution.
[3:03:03.580 --> 3:03:08.540]  The post that appeared on the subreddit for Seattle Chas Autonomous Zone now renamed
[3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:11.140]  CHOP because they want to chop people's heads off, so peaceful.
[3:03:11.140 --> 3:03:15.260]  That has been taken over by left-wing extremists to just rounding up all the white people
[3:03:15.260 --> 3:03:18.020]  and organizing them into forced work brigades.
[3:03:18.020 --> 3:03:20.460]  So tolerant.
[3:03:20.460 --> 3:03:22.620]  Manual labor, gulags.
[3:03:22.620 --> 3:03:23.620]  So progressive.
[3:03:23.620 --> 3:03:24.620]  That's right.
[3:03:24.620 --> 3:03:30.100]  Some of the very same people protesting against racism and slavery want to enslave people
[3:03:30.100 --> 3:03:32.020]  based on their skin color.
[3:03:32.020 --> 3:03:34.260]  So progressive.
[3:03:34.260 --> 3:03:38.740]  The discussion appears to be focused around identifying potential white supremacists who
[3:03:38.740 --> 3:03:43.380]  are trying to infiltrate Chas, which is basically anyone but themselves, a six-block area of
[3:03:43.380 --> 3:03:48.380]  downtown Seattle occupied by Antifa and BLM supporters.
[3:03:48.380 --> 3:03:52.780]  The area has now been renamed CHOP as I just discussed because the French Revolutionaries
[3:03:52.780 --> 3:03:54.980]  are so peaceful.
[3:03:54.980 --> 3:04:00.660]  And then it gets to this Reddit post where somebody says, I can help keep a lookout for
[3:04:00.660 --> 3:04:01.660]  them.
[3:04:01.660 --> 3:04:02.660]  That's right.
[3:04:02.660 --> 3:04:06.780]  They're talking about imaginary white supremacists, which they think are everywhere.
[3:04:06.780 --> 3:04:08.140]  What are the signs to identify them?
[3:04:08.140 --> 3:04:10.780]  I would think going up to ask them is dangerous.
[3:04:10.780 --> 3:04:12.740]  Anyone that is white, said a respondent.
[3:04:12.740 --> 3:04:16.980]  So anyone that's white is a white supremacist.
[3:04:16.980 --> 3:04:22.300]  And then this other person said, quote, I genuinely don't understand why we don't just round up
[3:04:22.300 --> 3:04:27.980]  all the white people in Chas and put them to work tending the crops and other such tasks.
[3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:32.020]  Things would be far more efficient with a large workforce and it would act as a way
[3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:36.220]  of keeping the white menace under control.
[3:04:36.220 --> 3:04:43.700]  Literally most of the people there, probably about 60% are white, if not more.
[3:04:43.700 --> 3:04:48.700]  So put like 67% of them on work gulag forms, great.
[3:04:48.700 --> 3:04:52.540]  We can have an armed supervisor to watch over them as they work so there's no risk of any
[3:04:52.540 --> 3:04:53.820]  racist backlash.
[3:04:53.820 --> 3:04:58.860]  They're literally describing the equivalent of putting slaves to work in cotton fields
[3:04:58.860 --> 3:05:02.700]  overwatched by armed white supremacists.
[3:05:02.700 --> 3:05:05.700]  It's literally the reverse.
[3:05:05.700 --> 3:05:11.700]  But still the same thing was previously revealed that BLM occupiers were demanding white people
[3:05:11.700 --> 3:05:15.700]  each hand over $10 to their Chas comrades as a form of reparations.
[3:05:15.700 --> 3:05:16.780]  No, that's not enough.
[3:05:16.780 --> 3:05:21.820]  You need to make them tend the crops in forced gulags.
[3:05:21.820 --> 3:05:23.820]  That's progressive.
[3:05:23.820 --> 3:05:27.780]  And again, we know they're not progressive and if you said that to them, they would
[3:05:27.780 --> 3:05:31.220]  tell you no, we're not progressive, we're violent radicals, we want to overthrow the
[3:05:31.220 --> 3:05:32.220]  government.
[3:05:32.220 --> 3:05:34.420]  They'll be honest with you in many cases.
[3:05:34.420 --> 3:05:35.420]  That's not my problem.
[3:05:35.420 --> 3:05:41.420]  The problem is the media, Bloomberg Business Week, the cops are gone but the area hasn't
[3:05:41.420 --> 3:05:43.420]  devolved into violent disorder.
[3:05:43.420 --> 3:05:46.300]  Yes it has and it's going to get a lot worse.
[3:05:46.300 --> 3:05:50.940]  They'll probably send the police in within a week or so.
[3:05:50.940 --> 3:05:52.500]  I say leave them to it.
[3:05:52.500 --> 3:05:53.500]  It's hilarious.
[3:05:53.500 --> 3:05:56.500]  The content out of this is just never ending.
[3:05:56.500 --> 3:05:59.300]  Chas is the gift that keeps on giving.
[3:05:59.300 --> 3:06:03.580]  Man wearing MAGA hat carrying American flag walks through Chas.
[3:06:03.580 --> 3:06:10.740]  Now to their credit, because some of the individuals in this area are aware of optics and aware
[3:06:10.740 --> 3:06:14.660]  of the fact that it doesn't look too great if they're literally pommeling and beating
[3:06:14.660 --> 3:06:18.100]  up Trump supporters on a daily basis.
[3:06:18.100 --> 3:06:23.740]  Some of these individuals that you see here, the minority as you can see, desperately try
[3:06:23.740 --> 3:06:27.260]  to keep the mob away from lynching this guy.
[3:06:27.260 --> 3:06:33.500]  He walks through the entire area, gets his flag stolen by some white Antifa, gets his
[3:06:33.500 --> 3:06:36.300]  hat stolen by some white Antifa.
[3:06:36.300 --> 3:06:38.940]  They managed to get it back.
[3:06:38.940 --> 3:06:43.740]  He eventually gets to this area where they just pin him up against this fence and the
[3:06:43.740 --> 3:06:49.620]  only way he can get out of the area with any degree of respect, I guess, although it takes
[3:06:49.620 --> 3:06:52.380]  a lot of courage to walk through there.
[3:06:52.380 --> 3:06:56.020]  Even if you're not carrying an American flag, if you don't identify with them, he has to
[3:06:56.020 --> 3:07:02.380]  sell the flag and then finally, as he's being berated and almost lynched, he's finally able
[3:07:02.380 --> 3:07:03.900]  to leave the area.
[3:07:03.900 --> 3:07:04.900]  This is Chas.
[3:07:04.900 --> 3:07:05.900]  It's so peaceful.
[3:07:05.900 --> 3:07:07.060]  It's so progressive.
[3:07:07.060 --> 3:07:09.740]  It's so tolerant according to the mainstream media.
[3:07:09.740 --> 3:07:10.740]  Don't go away.
[3:07:10.740 --> 3:07:12.740]  We'll be right back to summit.news.
[3:07:12.740 --> 3:07:17.140]  Hello, Rob Do here with infowarstore.com and I've got some good news and some bad news.

[3:08:06.540 --> 3:08:07.540]  stack.

[3:08:12.820 --> 3:08:16.580]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[3:08:16.580 --> 3:08:20.740]  Coffee and energy drinks provide a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[3:08:20.740 --> 3:08:25.260]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go, Turbo Force.
[3:08:25.260 --> 3:08:30.900]  Turbo Force from info wars life utilizes vitamins, amino acids and extracts used across the globe
[3:08:30.900 --> 3:08:34.460]  to provide focus, clarity and a boost of energy when you need it.
[3:08:34.460 --> 3:08:38.860]  Turbo Force is a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable and tasty energy.
[3:08:38.860 --> 3:08:43.340]  Try adding this to your daily routine and revolutionize your day today.
[3:08:43.340 --> 3:08:46.980]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[3:08:46.980 --> 3:08:50.860]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the
[3:08:50.860 --> 3:08:54.020]  info wars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[3:08:54.020 --> 3:08:57.580]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy and delicious drinking
[3:08:57.580 --> 3:08:58.580]  water.
[3:08:58.580 --> 3:09:01.620]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with the healthier source of water, the Alexa Pure
[3:09:01.620 --> 3:09:05.020]  Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[3:09:05.020 --> 3:09:09.300]  This groundbreaking, gravity fed water filtration system is like no other.
[3:09:09.300 --> 3:09:15.540]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[3:09:15.540 --> 3:09:41.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:41.540 --> 3:09:49.420]  Twenty-two people have died as a result of the riots after the death of George Floyd.
[3:09:49.420 --> 3:09:54.460]  Twenty-two people, nineteen of those from gunshots and there was almost another death
[3:09:54.460 --> 3:09:55.460]  yesterday.
[3:09:55.460 --> 3:10:00.580]  And that death toll includes protesters and police by the way.
[3:10:00.580 --> 3:10:05.380]  This headline out of information liberation video, rioters tearing down statue, chase
[3:10:05.380 --> 3:10:10.340]  man down and attack him, man shoots a saline in self defense.
[3:10:10.340 --> 3:10:16.020]  This is the second time that somebody has almost died as a result of the absolute anarchy
[3:10:16.020 --> 3:10:22.900]  chaos and bedlam from this violent angry mob trying to tear down statues.
[3:10:22.900 --> 3:10:27.020]  Violent mob of rioters trying to tear down a statue in Albuquerque, New Mexico and they
[3:10:27.020 --> 3:10:31.820]  did on Monday were filmed chasing down a man in the streets and attacking him with fists
[3:10:31.820 --> 3:10:36.260]  and a skateboard only for the man to shoot one himself defense.
[3:10:36.260 --> 3:10:43.620]  Now this guy, to be fair, was being belligerent before he was assaulting people in the crowd.
[3:10:43.620 --> 3:10:49.460]  Then he was subjected to an assault himself as he saw whacked with a skateboard, chased
[3:10:49.460 --> 3:10:50.460]  down the street.
[3:10:50.460 --> 3:10:55.300]  I think at the last point there's two or three or four of them trying to beat him to death.
[3:10:55.300 --> 3:10:58.500]  He probably, people have been killed from this.
[3:10:58.500 --> 3:10:59.500]  People have been killed.
[3:10:59.500 --> 3:11:03.380]  You know, the police captain who's killed, others have been killed from being beaten
[3:11:03.380 --> 3:11:04.380]  up in the streets.
[3:11:04.380 --> 3:11:07.980]  His life was on the line and he acted in total self defense.
[3:11:07.980 --> 3:11:13.260]  The media is not really picking up on this because they can't use their victimhood narrative.
[3:11:13.260 --> 3:11:17.180]  The media and Twitter article were reporting on the story as a white supremacist attack
[3:11:17.180 --> 3:11:19.380]  on peaceful protesters.
[3:11:19.380 --> 3:11:23.500]  The narrative collapsed after video surfaced showing the lynch mob chasing the man down
[3:11:23.500 --> 3:11:26.540]  pulling him, throwing him to the ground and bashing him with a skateboard.
[3:11:26.540 --> 3:11:30.140]  The man then fired back in self defense.
[3:11:30.140 --> 3:11:34.860]  Unconfirmed reports claim the man was trying to protect the statue, which was probably
[3:11:34.860 --> 3:11:39.620]  a fall on task, given that he was on his own, and could have been part of a patriot group
[3:11:39.620 --> 3:11:41.500]  called the New Mexico Civil Guard.
[3:11:41.500 --> 3:11:45.260]  If that was the case, where were the other members of the group?
[3:11:45.260 --> 3:11:49.620]  Democratic New Mexico Governor Michelle Grisham issued a statement after the above video surfaced
[3:11:49.620 --> 3:11:54.500]  where she sided with the mob, or the shocker convicted the patriot group without evidence
[3:11:54.500 --> 3:11:55.500]  or trial.
[3:11:55.500 --> 3:12:00.060]  I saw many tweets saying that this alleged patriot group doesn't even exist, by the
[3:12:00.060 --> 3:12:03.940]  way, neglected to mention that the writers were tearing down a statue and said she's
[3:12:03.940 --> 3:12:08.740]  praying for the attacker and suggested it doesn't matter who strikes first.
[3:12:08.740 --> 3:12:13.580]  Of course, that victimhood narrative, perpetual victimhood, it doesn't matter who strikes
[3:12:13.580 --> 3:12:14.580]  first.
[3:12:14.580 --> 3:12:17.860]  They can be beating you to a pulp on the streets, and it's your fault because you're white,
[3:12:17.860 --> 3:12:18.860]  you're racist.
[3:12:18.860 --> 3:12:21.420]  So someone almost died from that.
[3:12:21.420 --> 3:12:26.900]  A BLM activist did die, not at the hands of a white supremacist, but at the hands of
[3:12:26.900 --> 3:12:29.140]  a black man.
[3:12:29.140 --> 3:12:30.620]  That doesn't really fit the narrative either.
[3:12:30.620 --> 3:12:31.620]  Does it?
[3:12:31.620 --> 3:12:36.460]  Again, Information Liberation reports BLM activists who said white racists are the enemy, allegedly
[3:12:36.460 --> 3:12:39.900]  murdered by black men in Tallahassee.
[3:12:39.900 --> 3:12:45.300]  Career criminal Aaron Glee Jr. 49 was arrested over the weekend by the Orlando Police Department
[3:12:45.300 --> 3:12:50.180]  or warrants out of Leon County in connection with the deaths of black lives matter activists.
[3:12:50.180 --> 3:12:57.020]  No chance of pronouncing that name, 19 years old, an ALP volunteer victorious in 75.
[3:12:57.020 --> 3:13:01.900]  Dalau was a BLM activist who recently told protesters to remember that white racists
[3:13:01.900 --> 3:13:04.420]  are the enemy.
[3:13:04.420 --> 3:13:09.820]  Then I had saw this on Twitter a couple of days ago, people was hyperventilating over
[3:13:09.820 --> 3:13:13.340]  a black lives matter activists has been killed.
[3:13:13.340 --> 3:13:18.580]  When it came out, she was killed by a black man, kind of disappeared in a hurry.
[3:13:18.580 --> 3:13:24.780]  Meanwhile, the Blaze reports Olympian Bear who supported black lives matter calls protest
[3:13:24.780 --> 3:13:28.700]  vandalism at her home, domestic terrorism.
[3:13:28.700 --> 3:13:34.060]  You can't but not laugh at this that she does a picture of the front of her house or a residence,
[3:13:34.060 --> 3:13:39.900]  whatever it is, mayors residence, I guess she's got a BLM sign in the window.
[3:13:39.900 --> 3:13:47.380]  She's got an LGBT rainbow flag hung outside and yet her property still gets vandalized.
[3:13:47.380 --> 3:13:52.980]  And it looks like he's literally spray painting BLM on the wall of her house and she's already
[3:13:52.980 --> 3:13:55.900]  got a sign that says BLM in the window.
[3:13:55.900 --> 3:14:00.780]  So even she, she double caved, she's got the BLM sign.
[3:14:00.780 --> 3:14:03.060]  She's got the LGBT flag.
[3:14:03.060 --> 3:14:04.500]  Not good enough.
[3:14:04.500 --> 3:14:05.500]  Not good enough.
[3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:10.460]  Her home was vandalized by the mob, the mayor of Olympia, Washington express support for
[3:14:10.460 --> 3:14:15.860]  the black lives matter cause, but she's literally got all the accrued tramons of virtue signaling
[3:14:15.860 --> 3:14:18.260]  she's publicly express support.
[3:14:18.260 --> 3:14:20.460]  No, not good enough.
[3:14:20.460 --> 3:14:24.180]  But when her own home was vandalized, she called it similar to domestic terrorism.
[3:14:24.180 --> 3:14:25.780]  It's like the tweet of that guy.
[3:14:25.780 --> 3:14:31.500]  I think he was some kind of sports presenter who in response to the original Minneapolis
[3:14:31.500 --> 3:14:34.620]  riots tweeted, burn it all down.
[3:14:34.620 --> 3:14:38.740]  And then they turned up at his gated community and he suddenly had a hissy fit and did a
[3:14:38.740 --> 3:14:40.420]  complete 180.
[3:14:40.420 --> 3:14:44.380]  It was one of the Twitter moments of 2020.
[3:14:44.380 --> 3:14:45.980]  This is similar.
[3:14:45.980 --> 3:14:50.900]  Mayor Cheryl Selby made the comments after her home was vandalized on Friday with black
[3:14:50.900 --> 3:14:55.660]  lives matter graffiti, though she already displayed support for the movement.
[3:14:55.660 --> 3:14:57.700]  She said, I'm really trying to process this.
[3:14:57.700 --> 3:14:59.180]  It's like domestic terrorism.
[3:14:59.180 --> 3:15:01.860]  It's unfair.
[3:15:01.860 --> 3:15:07.500]  So everything they've done in the past four weeks, literally 22 people dead, attacking
[3:15:07.500 --> 3:15:14.860]  and taking over police stations, choking people half to death, stalking people, going to their
[3:15:14.860 --> 3:15:16.300]  houses, trying to attack them.
[3:15:16.300 --> 3:15:21.100]  That's not domestic terrorism, but as soon as somebody paints a BLM tag, the graffiti
[3:15:21.100 --> 3:15:24.420]  tag on the front of her house, then it's domestic terrorism.
[3:15:24.420 --> 3:15:29.140]  Because the vandalism was part of the process that turned to rioting in downtown Olympia.
[3:15:29.140 --> 3:15:33.180]  Businesses were vandalized with spray paint, flags burned, windows were smashed.
[3:15:33.180 --> 3:15:39.620]  But only when her house was vandalized did she suddenly have a massive change of heart.
[3:15:39.620 --> 3:15:45.820]  Boston Mayor backs removal of Lincoln statue, this is out of Breitbart, opposes renaming
[3:15:45.820 --> 3:15:48.820]  Fennel Hall despite slave history.
[3:15:48.820 --> 3:15:52.740]  This is the Boston Mayor Marcy Walsh, who's come out in favor of removing a statue of
[3:15:52.740 --> 3:15:56.060]  Abraham Lincoln, not like he fought a war to end slavery, is it?
[3:15:56.060 --> 3:16:03.460]  No, he has to go to, because again, it's not about slavery, it's about over-growing America.
[3:16:03.460 --> 3:16:09.300]  A statue that has stood in the city for more than a century, but he's opposed to renaming
[3:16:09.300 --> 3:16:14.060]  Fennel Hall, which is named for a slave owner and is on the site of a slave market.
[3:16:14.060 --> 3:16:16.980]  Left-wing activists trying to have a statue of Abraham Lincoln removed from Park Square
[3:16:16.980 --> 3:16:21.820]  after nearly 150 years, because they find the depiction of an emancipated slave in the
[3:16:21.820 --> 3:16:23.500]  sculpture to be offensive.
[3:16:23.500 --> 3:16:29.860]  So the statue celebrates Abraham Lincoln for emancipating the slaves, celebrates a freed
[3:16:29.860 --> 3:16:35.740]  slave in the statue, but now even that's too offensive, that's got to go.
[3:16:35.740 --> 3:16:37.940]  Again, because it's a historical monument.
[3:16:37.940 --> 3:16:42.700]  It's about overturning history has nothing to do with slavery.
[3:16:42.700 --> 3:16:45.580]  It's about the long march through the institutions.
[3:16:45.580 --> 3:16:46.580]  Now they control them.
[3:16:46.580 --> 3:16:50.740]  Now they control the media, which says all this is peaceful and progressive.
[3:16:50.740 --> 3:16:56.060]  They can get away with murder, literally in some cases, murder.
[3:16:56.060 --> 3:17:00.900]  We've seen the rioters not being charged, even after they do get arrested.
[3:17:00.900 --> 3:17:02.860]  We've seen the bail money being stolen.
[3:17:02.860 --> 3:17:07.620]  I'm going to get into that story in a moment, but this says the statue has stood there since
[3:17:07.620 --> 3:17:13.420]  1879 as a replica of an original statue built with funds contributed by freed slaves.
[3:17:13.420 --> 3:17:19.300]  Though the freed slaves actually contribute to the statue, no, it's still got to go.
[3:17:19.300 --> 3:17:23.260]  Mayor Walsh's office told the Boston Globe he favours removing the Lincoln statue and
[3:17:23.260 --> 3:17:26.260]  replacing it with one that recognizes equality.
[3:17:26.260 --> 3:17:31.100]  Again, whatever that means, he literally freed the slave, literally fought a war, millions
[3:17:31.100 --> 3:17:32.300]  of dead to free the slaves.
[3:17:32.300 --> 3:17:33.300]  No, we've got to go.
[3:17:33.300 --> 3:17:35.180]  He's got to go.
[3:17:35.180 --> 3:17:39.420]  Now we'll suppose renamed Fennel Hall a major tourist attraction.
[3:17:39.420 --> 3:17:42.060]  So again, looks like Abraham Lincoln's days are numbered.
[3:17:42.060 --> 3:17:45.460]  Of course, now they're talking about blowing up Mount Rushmore.
[3:17:45.460 --> 3:17:49.740]  That's likely partly going to become part of the debate shortly.
[3:17:49.740 --> 3:17:54.420]  Woke mobs now destroying statues of leading anti-slavery figures will get into that after
[3:17:54.420 --> 3:17:55.420]  the break.
[3:17:55.420 --> 3:18:01.100]  We're also going to get into how Rick Wilson was humiliated by Domino's Pizza Company
[3:18:01.100 --> 3:18:05.540]  after mistaking a tweet, a modern tweet for an eight-year-old tweet, we're going to get
[3:18:05.540 --> 3:18:07.660]  into that and more on the other side.
[3:18:07.660 --> 3:18:09.140]  Breaking news at summit.news.
[3:18:09.140 --> 3:18:10.140]  Don't go away.
[3:18:10.140 --> 3:18:11.140]  We'll be right back.
[3:18:11.140 --> 3:18:13.660]  I was talking to my patron supplier, great suppliers.
[3:18:13.660 --> 3:18:16.620]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[3:18:16.620 --> 3:18:17.700]  It's the highest quality.
[3:18:17.700 --> 3:18:19.140]  They've got it.
[3:18:19.140 --> 3:18:23.140]  Use this little rest we have caught in the current to come up to the service, get some
[3:18:23.140 --> 3:18:25.340]  air before you get sucked back down.
[3:18:25.340 --> 3:18:27.860]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[3:18:27.860 --> 3:18:30.580]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[3:18:30.580 --> 3:18:36.140]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense trying to fully, you know, stop the globalist
[3:18:36.140 --> 3:18:40.820]  and we've given them a good run and I think down the road, they'll be defeated, but we
[3:18:40.820 --> 3:18:43.580]  are going to still go down the hard road now.
[3:18:43.580 --> 3:18:44.580]  There were a lot worse roads.
[3:18:44.580 --> 3:18:48.620]  We'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad
[3:18:48.620 --> 3:18:49.620]  in my view.
[3:18:49.620 --> 3:18:50.900]  You need to get high quality sort of food.
[3:18:50.900 --> 3:18:52.140]  It's something you need.
[3:18:52.140 --> 3:18:56.060]  We have high quality ready to get out to you and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins.
[3:18:56.060 --> 3:19:00.860]  So please take care of your storeable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders
[3:19:00.860 --> 3:19:01.860]  in now.
[3:19:01.860 --> 3:19:02.860]  So you get it.
[3:19:02.860 --> 3:19:03.860]  So you have it.
[3:19:03.860 --> 3:19:04.860]  It's in great containers.
[3:19:04.860 --> 3:19:05.860]  High quality.
[3:19:05.860 --> 3:19:06.860]  Last 25 years.
[3:19:06.860 --> 3:19:07.860]  Get it while you can.
[3:19:07.860 --> 3:19:10.460]  Because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[3:19:10.460 --> 3:19:14.300]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen
[3:19:14.300 --> 3:19:18.460]  to a song and telling you all these horrible things, but you notice almost everything we've
[3:19:18.460 --> 3:19:21.060]  talked about horrible has come true.
[3:19:21.060 --> 3:19:24.900]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[3:19:24.900 --> 3:19:28.020]  It's like telling somebody if you've got a pool, put a fence around it.
[3:19:28.020 --> 3:19:31.780]  If you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and
[3:19:31.780 --> 3:19:32.780]  drown.
[3:19:32.780 --> 3:19:33.780]  People don't listen.
[3:19:33.780 --> 3:19:34.780]  They go out and their kids dead in the pool.
[3:19:34.780 --> 3:19:38.420]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the
[3:19:38.420 --> 3:19:39.420]  first world.
[3:19:39.420 --> 3:19:44.780]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've
[3:19:44.780 --> 3:19:46.020]  orchestrated it.
[3:19:46.020 --> 3:19:50.620]  They admit it's good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and
[3:19:50.620 --> 3:19:55.900]  they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[3:19:55.900 --> 3:20:00.900]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public
[3:20:00.900 --> 3:20:03.340]  because it's their operations manual.
[3:20:03.340 --> 3:20:08.180]  I wish this wasn't the case, but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major
[3:20:08.180 --> 3:20:11.100]  institutions and we've got to stop them.
[3:20:11.100 --> 3:20:19.660]  It's finally here, introducing the new survival shield X2 spray, available now for 33% off

[3:21:14.500 --> 3:21:25.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:21:25.020 --> 3:21:34.740]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:21:34.740 --> 3:21:40.260]  While the media continues to tell us that BLM is a peaceful movement, we have to remember
[3:21:40.260 --> 3:21:45.660]  that the very founding of BLM, of course, I've talked about this several times before,
[3:21:45.660 --> 3:21:50.940]  the inspiration, the ideological guru behind Black Lives Matter is a woman called a Sartre
[3:21:50.940 --> 3:21:56.220]  Chakour who is literally on the FBI's top 10 most wanted terrorist list.
[3:21:56.220 --> 3:21:57.220]  So peaceful.
[3:21:57.220 --> 3:22:01.620]  She's a convicted cop killer in exile in Cuba.
[3:22:01.620 --> 3:22:09.380]  We have to remember that the last round of Black Lives Matter inspired protests or riots
[3:22:09.380 --> 3:22:16.140]  back in 2016 ended with five Dallas police officers being shot dead by a Black Lives
[3:22:16.140 --> 3:22:17.140]  Matter supporter.
[3:22:17.140 --> 3:22:20.620]  Everyone seems to have forgotten about that.
[3:22:20.620 --> 3:22:22.460]  Now we have this headline.
[3:22:22.460 --> 3:22:27.140]  Police officers shot in the head during BLM protests is paralyzed from the neck down.
[3:22:27.140 --> 3:22:30.380]  The police officer was shot in the head during the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Las
[3:22:30.380 --> 3:22:31.380]  Vegas.
[3:22:31.380 --> 3:22:34.380]  It's paralyzed from the neck down according to a statement.
[3:22:34.380 --> 3:22:39.740]  AP reports officer Shane Michelonis has been tentatively accepted at a spine rehabilitation
[3:22:39.740 --> 3:22:40.740]  center.
[3:22:40.740 --> 3:22:43.500]  He was expected to stay on a ventilator.
[3:22:43.500 --> 3:22:50.780]  20-year-old Edgar Samiego, Sam and Ego, has been charged with the shooting, the judge
[3:22:50.780 --> 3:22:54.820]  declaring in the video shows him walking by taking out a gun and firing at officers
[3:22:54.820 --> 3:22:55.820]  during the unrest.
[3:22:55.820 --> 3:22:59.260]  So you have the Black Lives Matter supporter literally just walking along and firing at
[3:22:59.260 --> 3:23:00.260]  police officers.
[3:23:00.260 --> 3:23:01.260]  So peaceful.
[3:23:01.260 --> 3:23:02.700]  So progressive.
[3:23:02.700 --> 3:23:10.180]  And yet the polls show that support for Black Lives Matter is higher than ever, significantly
[3:23:10.180 --> 3:23:14.660]  more support for Black Lives Matter than President Trump as Tucker Carlson explains
[3:23:14.660 --> 3:23:17.380]  in this video, which we're going to roll right now.
[3:23:17.380 --> 3:23:18.380]  Here it is.
[3:23:18.380 --> 3:23:21.580]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[3:23:21.580 --> 3:23:25.060]  Here's some bracing news we never expected to report.
[3:23:25.060 --> 3:23:29.020]  Black Lives Matter is now more popular than the president of the United States and not
[3:23:29.020 --> 3:23:33.020]  slightly more popular than the president, much more popular.
[3:23:33.020 --> 3:23:38.860]  A survey this week by Rasmussen, a right-leaning pollster, found that 62% of likely voters
[3:23:38.860 --> 3:23:42.220]  now have a favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter.
[3:23:42.220 --> 3:23:46.500]  The same time Rasmussen found that Donald Trump's approval rating was 43%, that's almost
[3:23:46.500 --> 3:23:47.660]  20 points lower.
[3:23:47.660 --> 3:23:51.540]  And by the way, Trump was not alone, Black Lives Matter is far more popular than Joe
[3:23:51.540 --> 3:23:53.380]  Biden is too.
[3:23:53.380 --> 3:23:57.060]  It's more popular than America's religious institutions, all of them.
[3:23:57.060 --> 3:24:00.660]  It's more popular than the media, the Congress, and big business.
[3:24:00.660 --> 3:24:05.540]  Black Matter is more popular by double digits than both the Democratic and the Republican
[3:24:05.540 --> 3:24:06.540]  parties.
[3:24:06.540 --> 3:24:09.100]  It's almost as popular as the U.S. military.
[3:24:09.100 --> 3:24:12.020]  It's much more popular than the Pope.
[3:24:12.020 --> 3:24:16.340]  The numbers are astounding, but the polls are not the only measure of it.
[3:24:16.340 --> 3:24:20.140]  Here's a Black Lives Matter rally from over the weekend in New York.
[3:24:20.140 --> 3:24:21.740]  Look at that picture.
[3:24:21.740 --> 3:24:24.300]  That is an ocean of people.
[3:24:24.300 --> 3:24:27.660]  Ask yourself the last time you saw a candidate for office who was able to draw a crowd like
[3:24:27.660 --> 3:24:28.660]  that.
[3:24:28.660 --> 3:24:33.580]  The media and their relentlessly fawning coverage usually describe Black Lives Matter as an activist
[3:24:33.580 --> 3:24:36.180]  group or a protest movement.
[3:24:36.180 --> 3:24:38.100]  But that's deception by understatement.
[3:24:38.100 --> 3:24:41.140]  Black Lives Matter is not a collection of marchers with signs.
[3:24:41.140 --> 3:24:44.980]  It's not a conventional political lobby like Planned Parenthood or the NRA.
[3:24:44.980 --> 3:24:48.700]  It's not pressuring Congress to pass some narrow new set of laws.
[3:24:48.700 --> 3:24:51.700]  Black Lives Matter is far more ambitious than that.
[3:24:51.700 --> 3:24:55.260]  It is working to remake the country and then to control it.
[3:24:55.260 --> 3:24:56.900]  It's a political party.
[3:24:56.900 --> 3:25:00.780]  As of tonight, Black Lives Matter may be the single most powerful political party in the
[3:25:00.780 --> 3:25:02.340]  United States.
[3:25:02.340 --> 3:25:05.540]  Nobody says that out loud, but politicians understand it perfectly well.
[3:25:05.540 --> 3:25:07.820]  If nothing else, they understand power.
[3:25:07.820 --> 3:25:09.820]  They can smell it at great distances.
[3:25:09.820 --> 3:25:14.020]  And that's why they're lining up to bow before Black Lives Matter.
[3:25:14.020 --> 3:25:20.780]  You can't really reform a department that is rotten to the root.
[3:25:20.780 --> 3:25:26.340]  We've heard our people cry out, I can't breathe.
[3:25:26.340 --> 3:25:31.340]  We've heard our people speak out, Black Lives Matter.
[3:25:31.340 --> 3:25:35.500]  This is a systemic problem that requires a comprehensive solution.
[3:25:35.500 --> 3:25:39.940]  And what I would say is that there is a legitimacy to this anger.
[3:25:39.940 --> 3:25:42.060]  There's a legitimacy to this outrage.
[3:25:42.060 --> 3:25:46.020]  None of what you just saw is a stretch for Democrats.
[3:25:46.020 --> 3:25:49.740]  They believe their long-term goals align with those of Black Lives Matter.
[3:25:49.740 --> 3:25:53.580]  And in fact, at times, the group functions as an arm of the Democratic Party.
[3:25:53.580 --> 3:25:57.580]  More telling, though, and more ominous, is the response from many Republicans.
[3:25:57.580 --> 3:26:01.500]  They've been happy to go along as well, or in Mitt Romney's case, even mowed the same
[3:26:01.500 --> 3:26:02.500]  slogans.
[3:26:02.500 --> 3:26:08.580]  The way to end violence and brutality, and to make sure that people understand the Black
[3:26:08.580 --> 3:26:11.500]  Lives Matter.
[3:26:11.500 --> 3:26:15.740]  That was the former Republican nominee for president, let that sink in.
[3:26:15.740 --> 3:26:20.300]  If there was ever an indicator of how powerful Black Lives Matter has become, you just saw
[3:26:20.300 --> 3:26:21.300]  it.
[3:26:21.300 --> 3:26:24.580]  Republican leaders brag about their strong conservative convictions, but mostly they
[3:26:24.580 --> 3:26:27.260]  just want to be on the winning team, whatever that is.
[3:26:27.260 --> 3:26:29.460]  That's why they pause before offending China.
[3:26:29.460 --> 3:26:33.100]  It's why when Black Lives Matter tells them to take a knee, they do.
[3:26:33.100 --> 3:26:35.780]  It's all pretty strange when you think about it.
[3:26:35.780 --> 3:26:41.140]  If the leaders of Black Lives Matter are political actors, and they are, then by definition,
[3:26:41.140 --> 3:26:45.340]  you're allowed to have any opinion you want to have about them.
[3:26:45.340 --> 3:26:49.060]  Black Lives Matter wants to run the country, therefore you can freely criticize Black Lives
[3:26:49.060 --> 3:26:50.300]  Matter.
[3:26:50.300 --> 3:26:53.900]  Those are the rules of our system, but not anymore.
[3:26:53.900 --> 3:26:57.580]  Imagine a world where you are punished for questioning the behavior of the president,
[3:26:57.580 --> 3:26:59.060]  or for insulting your local mayor.
[3:26:59.060 --> 3:27:00.900]  You probably can't imagine that.
[3:27:00.900 --> 3:27:02.300]  It's too bizarre.
[3:27:02.300 --> 3:27:05.060]  It's un-American, but that's where we are right now.
[3:27:05.060 --> 3:27:10.100]  Black Lives Matter has changed the rules, and here's their first new rule, no criticizing
[3:27:10.100 --> 3:27:11.500]  Black Lives Matter.
[3:27:11.500 --> 3:27:14.420]  You can be fired from your job if you disobey.
[3:27:14.420 --> 3:27:16.220]  Many Americans have been.
[3:27:16.220 --> 3:27:19.860]  On Friday, for example, the principal of a public school in Windsor, Vermont, was dismissed
[3:27:19.860 --> 3:27:23.940]  from her job for posting the following words on her personal Facebook page.
[3:27:23.940 --> 3:27:28.660]  While they understand the urgency to feel compelled to advocate for Black Lives, what
[3:27:28.660 --> 3:27:30.580]  about our fellow law enforcement?
[3:27:30.580 --> 3:27:35.380]  Just because I don't walk around with a BLM sign should not mean I'm a racist.
[3:27:35.380 --> 3:27:36.380]  And quote.
[3:27:36.380 --> 3:27:38.780]  Unfortunately, the principal's boss disagreed.
[3:27:38.780 --> 3:27:44.780]  The superintendent of Windsor schools described the quote you just heard as quote, outright racist.
[3:27:44.780 --> 3:27:48.460]  Windsor, Vermont, by the way, is more than 97% white.
[3:27:48.460 --> 3:27:52.180]  Also on Friday, an economist called Harold Eulig lost his job at the Federal Reserve
[3:27:52.180 --> 3:27:56.980]  Bank of Chicago for daring to offer even milder criticism than that.
[3:27:56.980 --> 3:28:01.380]  On Twitter, Eulig noted that Black Lives Matter had quote, just torpedoed itself with
[3:28:01.380 --> 3:28:04.940]  its full-fledged support of hashtag defund the police.
[3:28:04.940 --> 3:28:09.660]  Now is the time, Eulig noted, quote, for sensible adults to enter back into the room and have
[3:28:09.660 --> 3:28:14.220]  serious earnest respectful conversations about it all.
[3:28:14.220 --> 3:28:20.860]  Meanwhile, the polls show support for Black Lives Matter over 60% amongst Americans.
[3:28:20.860 --> 3:28:25.660]  Of course, according to the most generous polls, Trump is hovering around 40%.
[3:28:25.660 --> 3:28:27.340]  Are they blind?
[3:28:27.340 --> 3:28:28.580]  They cave to the mob?
[3:28:28.580 --> 3:28:33.900]  Well, it's a bit of both, but where's the money gone is another question.
[3:28:33.900 --> 3:28:38.940]  Headline out of Newsweek, Minnesota Freedom Fund reveals only $200,000 of millions in
[3:28:38.940 --> 3:28:41.860]  donations has been spent to bail out protesters.
[3:28:41.860 --> 3:28:46.540]  Remember the campaign from the celebrities, many of which donated their own money to bail
[3:28:46.540 --> 3:28:52.100]  out the protesters, the rioters, the criminal rioters who were locked up and should have
[3:28:52.100 --> 3:28:54.780]  remained locked up for a very long time.
[3:28:54.780 --> 3:29:00.940]  They raised $35 million to bail out these rioters.
[3:29:00.940 --> 3:29:06.380]  They've only spent $200,000 of it actually bailing people out.
[3:29:06.380 --> 3:29:07.980]  Where's the money gone?
[3:29:07.980 --> 3:29:10.260]  Joe Biden's campaign, surely.
[3:29:10.260 --> 3:29:13.860]  The Minnesota Freedom Fund faced social media backlash after it revealed on Twitter has
[3:29:13.860 --> 3:29:18.780]  spent around $200,000 to bail out protesters, despite receiving millions in donations in
[3:29:18.780 --> 3:29:19.780]  recent weeks.
[3:29:19.780 --> 3:29:22.220]  So nobody knows where that money's gone.
[3:29:22.220 --> 3:29:28.700]  Meanwhile, Bill de Blasio in New York is having the gates of parks and Jewish areas welded
[3:29:28.700 --> 3:29:29.700]  shut.
[3:29:29.700 --> 3:29:36.580]  Meanwhile, advocating black trans lives matter protesters in New York, gathered, occupied,
[3:29:36.580 --> 3:29:40.220]  attended by tens of thousands of people.
[3:29:40.220 --> 3:29:45.700]  This is after New York City told COVID contact tracers not to ask people if they attended
[3:29:45.700 --> 3:29:51.980]  BLM protests, they're literally telling the people tasked with doing this contact tracing
[3:29:51.980 --> 3:29:58.020]  for potential coronavirus infectees, don't ask them if they attended a black lives matter
[3:29:58.020 --> 3:29:59.780]  protest.
[3:29:59.780 --> 3:30:02.940]  Why don't they want that information to be in the record?
[3:30:02.940 --> 3:30:08.860]  Because if there is a second wave of COVID-19, if it's because of these mass gatherings which
[3:30:08.860 --> 3:30:14.300]  people like Bill de Blasio have advocated and openly supported, then they can avoid
[3:30:14.300 --> 3:30:21.020]  blame because that information is not going to be in the system, blatant, blatant cover-up.
[3:30:21.020 --> 3:30:26.940]  Meanwhile in the UK on the same issue, thousands signed petition to close Bista Village over
[3:30:26.940 --> 3:30:28.260]  COVID-19 concerns.
[3:30:28.260 --> 3:30:33.140]  So we had the same thing, we had the mayor of London, we had all these officials advocating
[3:30:33.140 --> 3:30:37.020]  the mass gathering of tens of thousands of people in central London.
[3:30:37.020 --> 3:30:43.220]  The same people are now angrily signing a petition to close a small shopping village
[3:30:43.220 --> 3:30:48.140]  in the UK because they were offended because people were too close to each other and not
[3:30:48.140 --> 3:30:52.260]  practicing proper social distancing.
[3:30:52.260 --> 3:30:57.660]  You've literally just advocated tens of thousands of people gathering in major cities and now
[3:30:57.660 --> 3:31:04.340]  you're upset about a few hundred people standing too close together outside a shop, completely
[3:31:04.340 --> 3:31:06.780]  absurd and ridiculous.
[3:31:06.780 --> 3:31:36.740]  Don't go away, we'll be right back.
[3:31:36.740 --> 3:31:41.620]  And again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to
[3:31:41.620 --> 3:31:43.020]  just ingest it into the stomach.
[3:31:43.020 --> 3:31:48.540]  We're really excited about it, it's 33% off out of the gates, it was listeners idea asking
[3:31:48.540 --> 3:31:52.740]  for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers
[3:31:52.740 --> 3:31:56.740]  and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and
[3:31:56.740 --> 3:31:58.820]  in some ways even better way.
[3:31:58.820 --> 3:32:05.020]  Get your survival shield X2 nascent iodine spray now at 33% off at infowarstore.com and
[3:32:05.020 --> 3:32:09.780]  experience the power of aerosolized X2 nascent iodine for yourself.
[3:32:09.780 --> 3:32:15.620]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot
[3:32:15.620 --> 3:32:20.620]  an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run
[3:32:20.620 --> 3:32:28.420]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards, they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and
[3:32:28.420 --> 3:32:29.420]  through their veins.
[3:32:29.420 --> 3:32:35.220]  All of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[3:32:35.220 --> 3:32:38.340]  Then you go bag them and haul them back in.
[3:32:38.340 --> 3:32:42.620]  Well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic
[3:32:42.620 --> 3:32:48.660]  numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's
[3:32:48.660 --> 3:32:52.780]  going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[3:32:52.780 --> 3:32:55.660]  Well for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according to
[3:32:55.660 --> 3:33:00.460]  the UN and I believe their numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[3:33:00.460 --> 3:33:02.300]  to depopulate the third world.
[3:33:02.300 --> 3:33:05.460]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're
[3:33:05.460 --> 3:33:09.260]  a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[3:33:09.260 --> 3:33:14.660]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[3:33:14.660 --> 3:33:15.660]  Hello, can you hear me?
[3:33:15.660 --> 3:33:16.660]  I sure can sir, thank you.
[3:33:16.660 --> 3:33:22.100]  Hey Alex, before I start man, I just wanted to talk to you bro and it's a pleasure to
[3:33:22.100 --> 3:33:23.500]  be talking right now here man.
[3:33:23.500 --> 3:33:24.900]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you brother.
[3:33:24.900 --> 3:33:28.620]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut and I just want to plug in.
[3:33:28.620 --> 3:33:34.620]  I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers
[3:33:34.620 --> 3:33:35.620]  that drive.
[3:33:35.620 --> 3:33:41.900]  There's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster
[3:33:41.900 --> 3:33:47.260]  and Red Bull and Rolla and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and
[3:33:47.260 --> 3:33:48.780]  I just want to thank you for that man.
[3:33:48.780 --> 3:33:53.380]  Well brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder
[3:33:53.380 --> 3:33:54.380]  there is.
[3:33:54.380 --> 3:33:57.420]  So this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name on
[3:33:57.420 --> 3:34:00.220]  it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this
[3:34:00.220 --> 3:34:04.020]  formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best, strongest, but
[3:34:04.020 --> 3:34:07.940]  healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so that means
[3:34:07.940 --> 3:34:08.940]  a lot to me, thank you.
[3:34:08.940 --> 3:34:10.660]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[3:34:10.660 --> 3:34:13.220]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[3:34:13.220 --> 3:34:15.900]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them and they fund the
[3:34:15.900 --> 3:34:19.260]  InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[3:34:19.260 --> 3:34:25.860]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[3:34:25.860 --> 3:34:33.620]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it and
[3:34:33.620 --> 3:34:37.940]  there's another innovation, it's the spray cap.
[3:34:37.940 --> 3:34:44.140]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo goo but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[3:34:44.140 --> 3:34:45.500]  it in a really great way.
[3:34:45.500 --> 3:34:50.060]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face, it's got organic alcohol in
[3:34:50.060 --> 3:34:54.220]  it so spray it right in your eyes but I just love it, personally, it has something that's
[3:34:54.220 --> 3:34:55.900]  a moisturizer as well.
[3:34:55.900 --> 3:34:59.460]  So, this is a real innovation, I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with
[3:34:59.460 --> 3:35:04.620]  a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out, smells
[3:35:04.620 --> 3:35:05.620]  great.
[3:35:05.620 --> 3:35:13.980]  It's so refreshing, this is a big winner.
[3:35:13.980 --> 3:35:26.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:26.940 --> 3:35:33.940]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul
[3:35:33.940 --> 3:35:34.940]  Joseph Watson.

[3:36:42.060 --> 3:36:46.460]  Headline up on some of the news, Rick Wilson humiliated after trying to politicize eight
[3:36:46.460 --> 3:36:48.820]  year old Domino's Pizza Tweet.
[3:36:48.820 --> 3:36:55.860]  Yes, this is the Rick Wilson, Neocon Never Trumpa, the guy who literally wished that
[3:36:55.860 --> 3:37:02.660]  Melania Trump would be infected with coronavirus, he's a pleasant individual, absolutely humiliated
[3:37:02.660 --> 3:37:05.100]  and owned by a pizza company.
[3:37:05.100 --> 3:37:11.380]  This is absolutely hilarious, Neocon Never Trumpa, Rick Wilson was humiliated after he
[3:37:11.380 --> 3:37:16.380]  attempted to politicize a thank you tweet sent by Domino's Pizza to White House Press
[3:37:16.380 --> 3:37:22.180]  Secretary Haley McKennany, apparently not realizing the tweet was eight years old.
[3:37:22.180 --> 3:37:27.980]  Now even if the tweet wasn't eight years old, how much of a tribalist hack do you need to
[3:37:27.980 --> 3:37:34.780]  be to get angry and try to whip up the outrage hate mob against somebody because they said
[3:37:34.780 --> 3:37:41.060]  I like your pizza, literally anything they will try and pick up and whip up a contrived
[3:37:41.060 --> 3:37:43.220]  outrage over.
[3:37:43.220 --> 3:37:47.740]  Wilson who is billed as a Republican strategist yet constantly amplifies left-wing rhetoric,
[3:37:47.740 --> 3:37:53.060]  he's one of these Republican Uncle Tom's who gets to sit on the peanut gallery on CNN
[3:37:53.060 --> 3:37:58.340]  and they pat him on the head as he says, orange man bad every night.
[3:37:58.340 --> 3:38:03.980]  Which is why his Twitter following, by the way, is full of far left resistance members,
[3:38:03.980 --> 3:38:08.380]  was responding to an exchange between McKennany and Domino's in which McKennany tweeted fun
[3:38:08.380 --> 3:38:12.180]  fact Domino's is way better than any New York City pizza.
[3:38:12.180 --> 3:38:14.300]  Domino's responded, that's one heck of a compliment.
[3:38:14.300 --> 3:38:15.300]  Thanks for the love.
[3:38:15.300 --> 3:38:16.700]  We appreciated it.
[3:38:16.700 --> 3:38:21.340]  This prompted Wilson to wade in an attempt to politicize the interaction by tweeting
[3:38:21.340 --> 3:38:24.620]  at Domino's, you just killed your brand.
[3:38:24.620 --> 3:38:30.180]  He literally tried to cancel Domino's pizza over a tweet.
[3:38:30.180 --> 3:38:35.460]  The problem is, he didn't appear to realize that the original exchange between McKennany
[3:38:35.460 --> 3:38:44.580]  and Domino's took place in 2012, eight years ago, long before Donald Trump was even president.
[3:38:44.580 --> 3:38:50.860]  And then what made it even more succulent was Domino's pizza came in, which to be fair
[3:38:50.860 --> 3:38:56.540]  is brave of them, given the current state of corporate virtue signaling in America.
[3:38:56.540 --> 3:39:01.380]  And they compounded the humiliation by responding to Wilson, well, it's unfortunate that thanking
[3:39:01.380 --> 3:39:05.700]  a customer for a compliment back in 2012 would be viewed as political.
[3:39:05.700 --> 3:39:08.780]  Guess that's 2020 for you.
[3:39:08.780 --> 3:39:13.180]  So they literally sent a tweet in response to the current White House press secretary
[3:39:13.180 --> 3:39:16.460]  when she was in college eight years ago.
[3:39:16.460 --> 3:39:21.940]  And this idiot, for some reason, got confused and thought it was a modern tweet and tried
[3:39:21.940 --> 3:39:29.540]  to cancel Domino's pizza because they responded to her saying, thank you, I like your pizza.
[3:39:29.540 --> 3:39:34.340]  How much of a tribalist hack do you need to be to engage in that kind of behavior?
[3:39:34.340 --> 3:39:39.180]  Even if it was a 2020 tweet, the same rules would apply.
[3:39:39.180 --> 3:39:44.060]  But because it was eight years old, he got absolutely humiliated on top of it.
[3:39:44.060 --> 3:39:48.020]  And Newsbusters reports this isn't the first major gaffe Wilson committed in his ongoing
[3:39:48.020 --> 3:39:50.860]  Twitter war with the president.
[3:39:50.860 --> 3:39:55.580]  Wilson made a sorry attempt to play gotcha over the coronavirus-induced market dip March
[3:39:55.580 --> 3:40:00.340]  9 by sharing a tweet the same day that appeared to be from Trump in 2015.
[3:40:00.340 --> 3:40:04.500]  The tweet he shared called for the punishment of a sitting president if the Dow Jones industrial
[3:40:04.500 --> 3:40:08.700]  average fell below 1,000 points in a single day.
[3:40:08.700 --> 3:40:13.220]  The tweet called it the Dow Jones, J-O-A-N-S.
[3:40:13.220 --> 3:40:16.940]  Wilson commented, I agree, Mr. President, the problem.
[3:40:16.940 --> 3:40:20.100]  Wilson agreed with a fact-checked fake tweet.
[3:40:20.100 --> 3:40:25.900]  And just as in this case, when he got probably thousands of thousands of retweets for a completely
[3:40:25.900 --> 3:40:30.380]  fraudulent fake tweet, there's no retraction whatsoever.
[3:40:30.380 --> 3:40:33.100]  They only ever double down.
[3:40:33.100 --> 3:40:35.580]  This happens all the time.
[3:40:35.580 --> 3:40:41.180]  Last week, somebody on Twitter claimed that President Trump had personally DM'd him.
[3:40:41.180 --> 3:40:47.260]  And then when the response wasn't likable to President Trump, he blocked the person,
[3:40:47.260 --> 3:40:51.860]  completely fake, and this idiot got up on Twitter and tried to legitimately claim that
[3:40:51.860 --> 3:40:59.060]  President Trump had personally DM'd just him to try and enlist his support, and then blocked
[3:40:59.060 --> 3:41:00.060]  him.
[3:41:00.060 --> 3:41:03.860]  And it literally got like 200,000 likes.
[3:41:03.860 --> 3:41:04.860]  Completely fake.
[3:41:04.860 --> 3:41:07.140]  Where's the Twitter fact-check on that?
[3:41:07.140 --> 3:41:08.140]  Non-existent.
[3:41:08.140 --> 3:41:11.980]  I remind you that we had this headline out of Fox News.
[3:41:11.980 --> 3:41:17.500]  Sequence CNN guest Rick Wilson mocks Melania Trump to, quote, hashtag, be infected with
[3:41:17.500 --> 3:41:18.500]  coronavirus.
[3:41:18.500 --> 3:41:22.780]  He's a very pleasant individual, and he's being completely humiliated today.
[3:41:22.780 --> 3:41:25.300]  He couldn't have happened to a better person.
[3:41:25.300 --> 3:41:28.420]  Meanwhile, coronavirus is back.
[3:41:28.420 --> 3:41:29.420]  Great.
[3:41:29.420 --> 3:41:30.420]  Just what we needed.
[3:41:30.420 --> 3:41:34.540]  Chinese capital and provinces impose travel curbs as coronavirus cases.
[3:41:34.540 --> 3:41:39.780]  Mount Chinese capital of Beijing banned high-risk people from leaving and curbed public transport
[3:41:39.780 --> 3:41:44.140]  on Tuesday to stop the spread of the most serious coronavirus flare-ups in February,
[3:41:44.140 --> 3:41:47.460]  which has stoked fears of a second wave of infections.
[3:41:47.460 --> 3:41:53.420]  Shanghai demanded some travelers from Beijing be quarantined for two weeks as 27 new COVID-19
[3:41:53.420 --> 3:41:58.500]  cases took the capital's current outbreaks 106 since Thursday.
[3:41:58.500 --> 3:42:01.580]  So they've banned people traveling.
[3:42:01.580 --> 3:42:04.380]  They're starting to shut down some of the airports.
[3:42:04.380 --> 3:42:06.620]  They're starting to shut down some of the schools.
[3:42:06.620 --> 3:42:10.940]  And guess where the virus came from? Oh, it came from another seafood market, the same
[3:42:10.940 --> 3:42:15.300]  ones that you're not allowed to criticize because that's racist.
[3:42:15.300 --> 3:42:18.860]  You're not allowed to call it the Wuhan virus, even though it came from Wuhan, that's racist.
[3:42:18.860 --> 3:42:20.940]  The exact same thing has happened again.
[3:42:20.940 --> 3:42:22.780]  They've got another outbreak.
[3:42:22.780 --> 3:42:28.500]  If this gets any worse, if they don't get it under control very swiftly, we need to block
[3:42:28.500 --> 3:42:33.780]  all incoming flights coming into the United States and the UK and every other Western
[3:42:33.780 --> 3:42:37.340]  country from China, and it needs to happen soon.
[3:42:37.340 --> 3:42:43.820]  There is no way the economy can withstand yet another bout of this situation, whether
[3:42:43.820 --> 3:42:46.540]  you believe coronavirus was exaggerated or not.
[3:42:46.540 --> 3:42:48.540]  You know what they're going to do if there's a second wave.
[3:42:48.540 --> 3:42:50.620]  They're going to try and lock down everything again.
[3:42:50.620 --> 3:42:56.660]  And of course, that is drastically harmful, not just in terms of the economy, but in terms
[3:42:56.660 --> 3:42:57.660]  of people's lives.
[3:42:57.660 --> 3:43:04.380]  In the UK, we've already had predicted 50,000 excess cancer deaths because people can't
[3:43:04.380 --> 3:43:08.260]  get treatment in hospitals because they devoted them all to COVID.
[3:43:08.260 --> 3:43:11.780]  Of course, the hospitals ended up being half empty.
[3:43:11.780 --> 3:43:15.060]  The nurses ended up dancing around in TikTok videos.
[3:43:15.060 --> 3:43:20.900]  They'll probably roll that out again while allowing people to travel all over the world
[3:43:20.900 --> 3:43:26.900]  because the free movement of people is vastly more important than saving lives, vastly more
[3:43:26.900 --> 3:43:31.900]  important than preserving the economy because globalism overrallies.
[3:43:31.900 --> 3:43:39.660]  Meanwhile, NBC News reports, Google bans two websites from its ad platform over protest
[3:43:39.660 --> 3:43:42.900]  articles.
[3:43:42.900 --> 3:43:48.340]  The Federalist and Zero Hedge will no longer be able to generate revenue from any advertisements
[3:43:48.340 --> 3:43:50.500]  served by Google ads.
[3:43:50.500 --> 3:43:51.900]  Why?
[3:43:51.900 --> 3:43:53.540]  Because of the content of their websites.
[3:43:53.540 --> 3:43:56.220]  Again, this is financially punishing people.
[3:43:56.220 --> 3:44:01.980]  This is an attack on NBC News' competition for one and all these other little tattletales
[3:44:01.980 --> 3:44:06.220]  who probably created the wave, which led to this deplatforming.
[3:44:06.220 --> 3:44:12.740]  Of course, a few days ago, surprisingly, Zero Hedge got back on Twitter.
[3:44:12.740 --> 3:44:16.580]  That's one of the unprecedented few examples where they actually admitted that banning
[3:44:16.580 --> 3:44:19.340]  them was a mistake and allowed them back on.
[3:44:19.340 --> 3:44:23.100]  But now Google has banned two far right websites.
[3:44:23.100 --> 3:44:26.940]  The Federalist is literally like a libertarian conservative website.
[3:44:26.940 --> 3:44:29.940]  It's hardly the daily stormer, is it?
[3:44:29.940 --> 3:44:35.500]  From its advertising platform, after research revealed, the tech giant was profiting from
[3:44:35.500 --> 3:44:41.420]  articles pushing unsubstantiated claims about Black Lives Matter protests.
[3:44:41.420 --> 3:44:46.420]  Unsubstantiated claims means telling the truth about the fact that it's violent, anarchistic
[3:44:46.420 --> 3:44:48.460]  and out of control.
[3:44:48.460 --> 3:44:49.940]  That's what they mean by that.
[3:44:49.940 --> 3:44:54.740]  Oh, by the way, guess whose article Zero Hedge carries on a daily basis multiple times
[3:44:54.740 --> 3:44:55.740]  a day?
[3:44:55.740 --> 3:44:56.740]  Yours truly.
[3:44:56.740 --> 3:45:01.300]  The two sites, Zero Hedge and the Federalist, will no longer be able to generate revenue
[3:45:01.300 --> 3:45:04.300]  from any advertisements served by Google Ants.
[3:45:04.300 --> 3:45:08.540]  A Google spokesperson said in an email, it took action after determining the website
[3:45:08.540 --> 3:45:11.780]  violated its policies on content related to race.
[3:45:11.780 --> 3:45:13.460]  You know what that content is?
[3:45:13.460 --> 3:45:19.140]  It's saying that 50% of violent crimes are committed by 13% of the population.
[3:45:19.140 --> 3:45:21.540]  Those kind of hate facts are not allowed.
[3:45:21.540 --> 3:45:28.100]  Of course, Infowars was completely banned by Google Ads what nearly two years ago now.
[3:45:28.100 --> 3:45:31.660]  Others are now on the receiving end of that financial punishment.
[3:45:31.660 --> 3:45:34.140]  It's about strangling competition.
[3:45:34.140 --> 3:45:38.140]  It's about top-down Silicon Valley censorship.
[3:45:38.140 --> 3:45:40.220]  They broke their own search engine.
[3:45:40.220 --> 3:45:43.740]  They broke YouTube search engine to de-platform people.
[3:45:43.740 --> 3:45:47.500]  So it's no surprise that they're now de-platforming people financially.
[3:45:47.500 --> 3:45:49.980]  It's going to wrap it up for now.
