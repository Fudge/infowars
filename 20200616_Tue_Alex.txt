[00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:06.272]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:17.518]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.279]  We will be hearing from Alex Jones today.
[00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.420]  Owen Troyer in studio again for Alex.
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.783]  A very heavy news day today.
[00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:29.384]  And I'll be getting to all the news.
[00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:43.278]  A lot of videos to get to and your phone calls before Paul Joseph Watson takes over at two o'clock central.
[00:00:43.278 --> 00:00:56.921]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, watching everything play out almost to a tee, how InfoWars told you it was going to play out, has an interesting
[00:00:57.984 --> 00:00:59.125]  Taste to it.
[00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.207]  An interesting feel to it.
[00:01:01.207 --> 00:01:06.351]  Because you almost feel handicapped.
[00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:15.158]  Especially when you have been censored and denied your right to free speech.
[00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:26.607]  When you have been lied about, slandered and libeled non-stop.
[00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:26.927]  And so,
[00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:37.989]  I saw two things today that really summarize the attack on free speech and the internet censorship.
[00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:44.054]  And it's not to make it about us here at InfoWars, except it is about us here at InfoWars.
[00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:49.759]  We are the test case.
[00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.140]  And it's summarized in two ways.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.584]  You have a study that just got released.
[00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:06.127]  A randomized trial on Twitter plus academia.
[00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:13.931]  112 papers were randomly chosen to be shared on Twitter by a group with around 58,000 followers or not to be shared.
[00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:20.115]  Papers that were tweeted accumulated four times more citations compared to non-tweeted papers over one year.
[00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:24.779]  And the study is, does tweeting improve citations?
[00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:28.981]  One-year results from the TSSMN perspective randomized trial.
[00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:33.683]  And so, the answer is obviously, yes!
[00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:35.484]  Big league.
[00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:36.864]  Huge league.
[00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:43.827]  It's like saying, hey, if you play your ad during the Super Bowl, will people see it?
[00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:47.769]  Yeah, it's just the most watched televised event in America.
[00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:06.855]  So, when InfoWars was allowed on YouTube and Twitter and Facebook and everything else, we would get, let's not exaggerate, ten times, a hundred times in some cases, the reach.
[00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:09.136]  We've been denied that.
[00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:09.436]  Why?
[00:03:09.436 --> 00:03:18.460]  Well, we don't plan terroristic attacks or violence or felonious activities like desecrating
[00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:21.682]  venerable objects and monuments.
[00:03:21.682 --> 00:03:35.308]  No, we just dare come on here and tell you the truth about what's really going on in America without the mainstream media filter, lies, bias, etc.
[00:03:35.308 --> 00:03:41.631]  And for that, and supporting Donald Trump, we aren't allowed on the Internet.
[00:03:41.631 --> 00:03:48.134]  Of course, thanks to your support at InfoWareStore.com, we still have banned video, which leads me to my second point.
[00:03:48.134 --> 00:03:48.514]  CIA
[00:03:50.484 --> 00:04:04.029]  Analyst for Fox News, Buck Sexton, puts out a whole thread about how conservatives need a platform that won't be censored, won't be curated, and will ultimately be free speech.
[00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:10.412]  Now, I like Buck Sexton, if that's his real name.
[00:04:10.412 --> 00:04:14.134]  I like his commentary on Fox News, but does he really not know about InfoWars?
[00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:16.374]  Does he really not know about Banned.Video?
[00:04:16.374 --> 00:04:17.515]  Do these people really not know?
[00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.879]  Do they really not know what we've built?
[00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.923]  Do they really not know this is the mothership?
[00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:29.686]  Has the censorship been that successful of InfoWars?
[00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:36.591]  Has the chilling of free speech been that successful against Americans?
[00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:37.912]  Well, I don't know.
[00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:42.795]  Maybe it has, maybe it hasn't, but I do know this.
[00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:44.697]  Even in these perilous times, folks,
[00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:50.765]  In the land of confusion and insanity, InfoWars isn't going anywhere.
[00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:52.786]  Oop!
[00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:55.628]  I think Barack Obama just cried a little bit.
[00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.650]  Just shed a little tear, because we're not all fair yet.
[00:04:59.554 --> 00:05:01.215]  It's finally here.
[00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:05.316]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:11.658]  Available now for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.635]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, June 16, 2020.
[00:06:13.905 --> 00:06:16.026]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:18.606]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:23.527]  A lot of news coming up, a lot of video clips coming up, and your phone calls.
[00:06:23.527 --> 00:06:33.950]  And hopefully, we'll be hearing live from our team on the ground from Chaz, or now otherwise known as Chop.
[00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:40.352]  Who knows, they may change their nation again before the end of this broadcast.
[00:06:40.352 --> 00:06:40.572]  We're
[00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.131]  Superheroes are running around in capes and masks.
[00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:51.493]  Vigilantes are handing out guns to miners.
[00:06:51.493 --> 00:06:54.834]  Police can't get through.
[00:06:54.834 --> 00:07:00.056]  Farmers are trying to grow crops on cardboard.
[00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:05.678]  Whiteboards with a list of demands and requests all over the town.
[00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:14.776]  And when a preacher goes in or a Trump supporter goes in, well, they're not welcome.
[00:07:14.776 --> 00:07:16.497]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show here today.
[00:07:16.497 --> 00:07:23.301]  I got a lot of news that I'm going to be covering.
[00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:29.024]  And I hate to see what the media has done to this country.
[00:07:29.024 --> 00:07:33.647]  It makes my blood boil.
[00:07:33.647 --> 00:07:34.748]  I hate to see that the
[00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:56.286]  Media in this country has pit American against American, has pit human against human, has pit logic and reasoning against lies and disinformation.
[00:07:56.286 --> 00:08:00.488]  These things have side effects.
[00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:14.790]  And everything we're witnessing in this country right now are the side effects.
[00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:26.492]  Now, I don't know if President Trump is going to play the Ace of Spades that he has before election night 2020.
[00:08:26.492 --> 00:08:30.073]  And he actually has a litany of Ace of Spades that he could play.
[00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:39.433]  I don't know if he's planning on doing that.
[00:08:39.433 --> 00:08:54.664]  I will tell you that he's planning on placating to the lowest common denominator right now of the Republican Party, of the conservative movement, and they are fully buying it.
[00:08:54.664 --> 00:08:56.705]  Oh, the jobs report is so great.
[00:08:56.705 --> 00:08:58.086]  Oh, look at these numbers.
[00:08:58.086 --> 00:08:59.967]  Oh, we're winning.
[00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:01.789]  Folks, I'm a big supporter of President Trump.
[00:09:02.605 --> 00:09:05.647]  And I want him to make the buzzer-beating, game-winning shot.
[00:09:05.647 --> 00:09:07.349]  I want him to play the Ace of Spades.
[00:09:07.349 --> 00:09:14.935]  And I want to support him and be proud of that for the rest of my life and everything we've done here to help him get in office and beyond.
[00:09:14.935 --> 00:09:18.338]  But I'm no fool.
[00:09:18.338 --> 00:09:22.161]  And I'm not going to tell you America's winning right now.
[00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:26.624]  Now, is there a silver lining to everything that we're witnessing right now?
[00:09:26.624 --> 00:09:29.046]  Perhaps.
[00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:31.108]  And perhaps it's setting us up for a great victory.
[00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:37.299]  Maybe in the short term, maybe in the long term.
[00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:54.490]  But when I have rioting going on for three straight weeks, when I have an economy that is not booming like it should be, I don't care what you print or say, I don't consider that winning.
[00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.133]  When I have Americans pit against one another because of mainstream media, I don't consider that winning.
[00:09:59.133 --> 00:09:59.914]  When I have known
[00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:14.265]  Felons and perjurers and people guilty of insurrection and treason running around this country continuing to engage in all their behavior, I don't consider that winning.
[00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:25.433]  But then again, I'm not part of the lowest common denominator Trump supporter that he's clearly trying to reach right now.
[00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:26.794]  And I don't think this audience is either.
[00:10:30.538 --> 00:10:37.342]  But look, the mainstream news has never been more bold-faced lying to your face.
[00:10:37.342 --> 00:10:43.026]  The hypocrisy has never been more abundant and clear.
[00:10:43.026 --> 00:10:49.951]  The disgust of the left and the Democrat Party has never been more clear.
[00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:59.717]  Their hatred for America, their hatred for Americans, their hatred for our Bill of Rights, their hatred for God, their hatred for everything that is good and righteous and true.
[00:11:01.596 --> 00:11:22.524]  And of course their mask is pretending to fight for what is good and righteous is true, but then when they're presented with the facts in accordance to their movement or their protest, well they ignore the facts and they stick with their feelings.
[00:11:22.524 --> 00:11:24.785]  But America is definitely witnessing this.
[00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:25.545]  There is no doubt.
[00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:34.272]  And there is a major political shakeup in this country happening.
[00:11:34.272 --> 00:11:43.815]  Now, my concern is that we're not moving swiftly enough against this wholeheartedly.
[00:11:43.815 --> 00:11:54.638]  And so, even if we do have some political victories in the short term, in the long term, we've just lost another portion of the idea of America.
[00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:03.074]  We still don't have a fully open country and Democrats are trying to shut it down.
[00:12:03.074 --> 00:12:09.196]  I have family in St.
[00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:09.816]  Louis.
[00:12:09.816 --> 00:12:11.096]  They reopened the St.
[00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:12.837]  Louis Zoo, I guess, today.
[00:12:12.837 --> 00:12:14.197]  Major attraction there.
[00:12:14.197 --> 00:12:17.978]  You can't go in without a mask.
[00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:20.359]  What?
[00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:23.499]  Hey, it's a requirement.
[00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:29.081]  In America, it's a requirement for you to wear a mask because the media faked the pandemic because they don't like the president.
[00:12:32.608 --> 00:12:50.874]  And that is what we cannot allow to be cemented into our culture and into our civilization, which is whatever the media wants to put out there, we just go along with it.
[00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:51.775]  Here's a headline here.
[00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:54.476]  Thrilled Bear Jumps for Joy as Visitors Return to the St.
[00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:56.076]  Louis Zoo.
[00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:58.017]  Boy, that's fun.
[00:12:58.017 --> 00:12:59.137]  I'd like to go to the zoo.
[00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:01.418]  I ain't wearing a mask.
[00:13:04.943 --> 00:13:09.826]  But that's the hinge on the door.
[00:13:09.826 --> 00:13:11.127]  The door is tyranny.
[00:13:11.127 --> 00:13:13.569]  The doorframe is America.
[00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:20.213]  That hinge is the American people.
[00:13:20.213 --> 00:13:30.820]  So, if you walk into a store, or the zoo, or whatever the case may be, and they say you need to wear a mask, and you just comply, well then that's the door.
[00:13:32.153 --> 00:13:35.695]  Shutting on America, you as The Hinge.
[00:13:35.695 --> 00:13:46.202]  But, if you, because The Hinge is two parts, if you and your other fellow American say, hey, you know what?
[00:13:46.202 --> 00:13:47.563]  Why am I wearing this mask?
[00:13:47.563 --> 00:13:50.024]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:13:50.024 --> 00:13:51.805]  And then the other American says, yeah, you know what?
[00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:53.086]  Doesn't make sense to me either.
[00:13:53.086 --> 00:13:54.006]  They just make us do it.
[00:13:54.006 --> 00:13:55.507]  And then you say, well, you know what?
[00:13:55.507 --> 00:13:56.368]  I don't think I'm going to wear it.
[00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:57.809]  And they say, you know what?
[00:13:57.809 --> 00:13:59.550]  I don't think I'm going to wear it or make you wear it.
[00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.891]  Say, OK, have a good day.
[00:14:02.062 --> 00:14:03.723]  The door didn't close!
[00:14:03.723 --> 00:14:06.105]  The door remains open.
[00:14:06.105 --> 00:14:08.466]  And we don't live in a tyrannical nation.
[00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:28.599]  But, if you accept that notion that you have to wear a mask, if you accept and we consciously agree that because the media said something or reported something and now we're responding to it just to get along, well then that's how tyranny
[00:14:30.501 --> 00:14:32.962]  Slams on America.
[00:14:32.962 --> 00:14:43.606]  But it takes we, the people, as the hinge to decide if the door closes or not.
[00:14:43.606 --> 00:14:50.569]  And so all this petty bickering and all this stuff in the streets, again, that's all media derived.
[00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:54.951]  But this can all be solved in time.
[00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.972]  But if we all consciously don't recognize
[00:14:59.158 --> 00:15:01.760]  Things like a fake pandemic done by the media.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.722]  Things like fake Russian collusion done by the media.
[00:15:04.722 --> 00:15:06.703]  Oh yeah, they have cohorts as well in the deep state.
[00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:09.305]  We know who they are.
[00:15:09.305 --> 00:15:16.730]  But let's specifically talk about the media because the media is the syringe.
[00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.831]  The deep state is the poison.
[00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:20.192]  The media is the syringe.
[00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:26.557]  And so that's how they get all of this done, folks.
[00:15:26.557 --> 00:15:28.859]  And that's why you see all the rioting and all the fighting.
[00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:33.562]  And by the way, I've got about six videos from this weekend.
[00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:36.144]  And I don't even want to be a part of this whole racial division thing.
[00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.866]  I just have to tell you what's going on.
[00:15:38.866 --> 00:15:44.249]  White people are now being targeted all across America for attack, and it's being cheered on.
[00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:49.293]  And I've got about six videos that will roll, and it'll just make your heart ache.
[00:15:49.293 --> 00:15:51.154]  Because it's young children now.
[00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:51.935]  Young children.
[00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:57.909]  Black children versus white children, all because mainstream media lies.
[00:15:57.909 --> 00:16:00.272]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[00:16:00.272 --> 00:16:06.240]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.206]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[00:16:11.331 --> 00:16:12.992]  That is amazing.
[00:16:12.992 --> 00:16:20.656]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[00:16:20.656 --> 00:16:22.978]  And there's another innovation.
[00:16:22.978 --> 00:16:25.059]  It's the spray cap.
[00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:30.482]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[00:16:30.482 --> 00:16:32.663]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[00:16:32.663 --> 00:16:33.564]  I like to put it on my hands.
[00:16:34.304 --> 00:16:35.825]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[00:16:35.825 --> 00:16:38.628]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[00:16:38.628 --> 00:16:43.032]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[00:16:43.032 --> 00:16:44.873]  So, this is a real innovation.
[00:16:44.873 --> 00:16:51.179]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:52.700]  It smells great.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.542]  It's so refreshing.
[00:16:54.542 --> 00:16:55.403]  This is a big winner.
[00:16:57.773 --> 00:16:58.974]  We're good to go!
[00:17:20.546 --> 00:17:22.768]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[00:17:22.768 --> 00:17:24.769]  It's great to keep with you.
[00:17:24.769 --> 00:17:31.013]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:32.754]  We're really excited about it.
[00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:34.756]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:17:34.756 --> 00:17:46.244]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[00:17:46.704 --> 00:18:00.755]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[00:18:00.755 --> 00:18:03.397]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:16.852 --> 00:18:18.032]  You found it.
[00:18:18.032 --> 00:18:20.073]  The tip of the spear.
[00:18:20.073 --> 00:18:27.514]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:18:27.514 --> 00:18:31.355]  I just got to get this off my chest and I'm going to go to the news.
[00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:38.016]  But I just don't understand what the hell President Trump is doing so far this year.
[00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:42.817]  I really don't get it.
[00:18:42.817 --> 00:18:45.158]  Failed to me on the coronavirus outbreak.
[00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:46.358]  Didn't close down the borders.
[00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:52.435]  Didn't make enough of an issue about China.
[00:18:52.435 --> 00:18:56.957]  And now where people are still wearing masks, now new mask orders are coming out.
[00:18:56.957 --> 00:18:58.898]  No spread, no virus, all fake.
[00:18:58.898 --> 00:19:04.840]  It turns out the Democrats sent them into the nursing homes, literally murdered them.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:13.864]  By the way, Steve Scalise, actually, we got his file, Steve Scalise released an issue or something basically demanding
[00:19:16.274 --> 00:19:25.976]  To know why the Democrat governor sent COVID infected patients to the nursing homes, which is responsible for like 80% of the COVID deaths in this country.
[00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:29.677]  Democrat governors murdered your grandmother.
[00:19:29.677 --> 00:19:34.059]  All for their cause of getting Trump out of office with a pandemic.
[00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:36.659]  That's how sick these people are.
[00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:41.580]  And they're running rampant.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.201]  You got riots going on in the streets.
[00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:45.828]  For three weeks now.
[00:19:45.828 --> 00:19:46.768]  Hey, you know what?
[00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:53.150]  If Trump measures it, hey, I don't want to step in, I don't want to do it, it's a trap, it's a setup, fine, I can understand that, I'll agree to that.
[00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.751]  But he should have said, Democrat riots, 500 times, every day by now.
[00:19:58.751 --> 00:20:01.391]  So that that branding sticks.
[00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:04.252]  And then the Democrats won't want to promote their little riots anymore!
[00:20:04.252 --> 00:20:05.992]  Oh, but, nope.
[00:20:05.992 --> 00:20:11.373]  And now he's issuing an executive order on police reform, which is a total fail.
[00:20:12.585 --> 00:20:14.246]  The police don't need reform, folks.
[00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:16.908]  The law needs reformed.
[00:20:16.908 --> 00:20:20.991]  The media needs reformed.
[00:20:20.991 --> 00:20:25.774]  Putting it lightly.
[00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:27.115]  It's not about police reform.
[00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:28.756]  It's about law reform.
[00:20:28.756 --> 00:20:37.522]  It's time to get the police out of our business.
[00:20:37.522 --> 00:20:40.824]  But no, we just blame the police instead of the war on drugs.
[00:20:42.739 --> 00:20:48.240]  Instead of all these little petty things police want to bother you about, like a seatbelt.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.681]  Get out of my car!
[00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:51.861]  Oh, you're on your cell phone.
[00:20:51.861 --> 00:20:53.841]  You have a whole computer screen on your dash.
[00:20:53.841 --> 00:20:54.802]  Well, you use cell phone.
[00:20:54.802 --> 00:20:57.562]  That's a citation.
[00:20:57.562 --> 00:20:59.043]  Law reform.
[00:20:59.043 --> 00:21:03.523]  By the way, all this law was written, most of it was written by Democrats.
[00:21:03.523 --> 00:21:05.644]  Mandatory minimums and sentencing and all that stuff.
[00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:09.991]  But there's your big one right there.
[00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:11.312]  The war on drugs.
[00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:17.258]  You want to stop most of this police brutality incidents and the war on drugs.
[00:21:17.258 --> 00:21:22.182]  Are crackheads going to go out and do crack and are heroin addicts going to go out and do heroin and ruin their lives?
[00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:23.063]  They sure are.
[00:21:23.063 --> 00:21:28.167]  It's none of the police's business to stop that.
[00:21:28.167 --> 00:21:32.691]  Oh, but you see it's all about pulling in those drugs.
[00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:33.532]  Making that money.
[00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:37.894]  It's just a sick joke.
[00:21:37.894 --> 00:21:40.836]  I didn't just blame police.
[00:21:40.836 --> 00:21:42.597]  Anyway.
[00:21:42.597 --> 00:21:45.078]  Again, Trump has all the ace of spades in his hand.
[00:21:45.078 --> 00:21:46.338]  Is he going to play them?
[00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:47.399]  Bring the troops home?
[00:21:47.399 --> 00:21:49.800]  Build the wall?
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.361]  Cut the taxes?
[00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:53.781]  Arrest Hillary Clinton?
[00:21:53.781 --> 00:21:59.164]  Arrest Barack Obama?
[00:21:59.164 --> 00:22:03.966]  Arrest the leaders of the Democrat Party, which is a domestic terror group?
[00:22:05.233 --> 00:22:07.695]  Black Lives Matter is the Democrat Party.
[00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:11.678]  Antifa is the Democrat Party.
[00:22:11.678 --> 00:22:13.859]  Occupy Wall Street is the Democrat Party.
[00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:16.241]  It's all the Democrat Party.
[00:22:16.241 --> 00:22:23.026]  And all of these fake social justice movements, all the funding goes right back to the Democrat Party.
[00:22:23.026 --> 00:22:25.447]  All of it!
[00:22:25.447 --> 00:22:27.489]  Including Planned Parenthood!
[00:22:27.489 --> 00:22:31.572]  I mean, can you imagine?
[00:22:34.204 --> 00:22:35.025]  Objectively?
[00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:38.028]  Let's say an alien actually lands in the United States.
[00:22:38.028 --> 00:22:41.331]  Just decides, okay, let's see here.
[00:22:41.331 --> 00:22:44.334]  Oh, what's this Planned Parenthood thing I see?
[00:22:44.334 --> 00:22:53.502]  Say, oh, that's just a government-funded institution that also gives taxpayer dollars to one political party only, the Democrat Party.
[00:22:53.502 --> 00:22:56.725]  Oh, okay, but what is, what do they do?
[00:22:56.725 --> 00:22:59.128]  Oh, they murder babies.
[00:22:59.128 --> 00:22:59.208]  Oh!
[00:23:00.794 --> 00:23:02.655]  They murder babies.
[00:23:02.655 --> 00:23:05.958]  We've got a ray gun up on my spaceship up there.
[00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:08.940]  We're gonna just go ahead and just blast this country into oblivion, okay?
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.501]  You murdered 50 million babies.
[00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:10.901]  You're done.
[00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:15.764]  It's all the Democrats.
[00:23:15.764 --> 00:23:22.489]  Everything... You know, look, I... Folks, it's just unbelievable at this point.
[00:23:22.489 --> 00:23:28.013]  And America sees through it, but my fear is... My fear is...
[00:23:29.488 --> 00:23:36.513]  If Trump doesn't take the buzzer-beating shot, if Trump doesn't play the ace of spades, this country's done.
[00:23:36.513 --> 00:23:37.374]  It's done.
[00:23:37.374 --> 00:23:47.321]  And everybody's so committed and hopeful and faithful in Trump that if he doesn't come through, we have no other eggs in the basket.
[00:23:47.321 --> 00:23:50.924]  We've put all of our eggs in the Trump basket.
[00:23:50.924 --> 00:23:52.665]  Hey, again, I want Trump to come through.
[00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:54.546]  He's the greatest president in modern-day history, no doubt.
[00:23:55.683 --> 00:24:05.827]  If I put all my eggs in the Trump basket, and then that basket gets lit on fire and burns at a Democrat riot and nobody stops it, then I don't have a basket or eggs.
[00:24:05.827 --> 00:24:10.629]  So I think it's time for Americans to put eggs in their own basket.
[00:24:10.629 --> 00:24:11.770]  What does that mean?
[00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.371]  Getting prepared, folks.
[00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:16.092]  Getting prepared.
[00:24:16.092 --> 00:24:21.694]  And so, hey, we've been selling emergency food at Infowarsstore.com for years, telling people to get prepared.
[00:24:23.311 --> 00:24:26.172]  So this isn't just a, hey, things are getting really bad.
[00:24:26.172 --> 00:24:30.233]  No, you can look outside in major cities and see what's going on.
[00:24:30.233 --> 00:24:37.556]  Now, if you live out in the country in a conservative area, in a Republican area, then you're probably not experiencing that.
[00:24:37.556 --> 00:24:44.018]  But if you're in a Democrat-run area, yeah, you're seeing rioting and looting and arson and rape and murder.
[00:24:44.018 --> 00:24:46.499]  It's a regular thing now.
[00:24:46.499 --> 00:24:49.240]  And they want to shut down the police, so I don't think it's going to get any better.
[00:24:50.919 --> 00:25:04.248]  So, if you can't get out, or if you can get out, you're going to want to have some emergency food with you because they, the Democrats at the end of this, with George Soros and China, want to stop our supply chain.
[00:25:04.248 --> 00:25:06.549]  Which, of course, would cut out the food supply.
[00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:18.677]  Now, what do you think is going to happen when the rioters and the looters go to Walmart and there's no food left for them to steal because the supply chain has been shut down?
[00:25:18.677 --> 00:25:20.218]  Well, they're going to come to your door, folks.
[00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:26.601]  So, in that respect, this is why we have the Second Amendment.
[00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:30.723]  And I'm sure a lot of people that were anti-Second Amendment are now changing their mind on that.
[00:25:30.723 --> 00:25:32.064]  So again, a silver lining.
[00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:43.330]  But InfoWarsTore.com, folks, not just the emergency food that we have available right now, but also top supplements are on sale, 60% off some of these top supplements at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:50.954]  Don't forget about the water filters, the air filters, the brand new Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray.
[00:25:51.994 --> 00:25:53.035]  So this is a spray now.
[00:25:53.035 --> 00:26:03.120]  If you prefer that way of doing the nascent iodine instead of the dropper, it's both available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.464]  And if you want to wear your colors loud and proud, we've got t-shirts at InfoWarsStore.com as well.
[00:26:08.464 --> 00:26:14.247]  Some of them subtle, some of them loud and in your face with just a bright red InfoWars logo right there on the chest.
[00:26:14.247 --> 00:26:18.569]  But it's all possible at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:26:18.569 --> 00:26:20.471]  Everything we do here.
[00:26:20.471 --> 00:26:20.731]  And so
[00:26:21.883 --> 00:26:32.449]  You know that at the end of the day what we stand for is truth and justice and America and independence, rugged individualism.
[00:26:32.449 --> 00:26:36.551]  That's what we stand for.
[00:26:36.551 --> 00:26:41.013]  Now my job is to not protect Trump by all means and all costs.
[00:26:41.013 --> 00:26:41.554]  My job
[00:26:42.794 --> 00:26:49.958]  is to protect America, protect truth, and to just give you all the information without the filter of the mainstream news.
[00:26:49.958 --> 00:26:54.101]  Did we just release a onesie at InfoRestore.com, Baby Lives Matter?
[00:26:54.101 --> 00:26:56.122]  Oh my gosh, this is the greatest thing ever.
[00:26:56.122 --> 00:26:58.563]  I was talking to my Patriot Supplier, Great Suppliers.
[00:26:58.563 --> 00:27:01.485]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[00:27:01.485 --> 00:27:02.585]  It's the highest quality.
[00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:03.106]  They've got it.
[00:27:03.986 --> 00:27:10.393]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[00:27:10.393 --> 00:27:12.915]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[00:27:12.915 --> 00:27:16.258]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[00:27:16.258 --> 00:27:21.123]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[00:27:21.123 --> 00:27:27.450]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but we're gonna still go down the hard road now.
[00:27:28.439 --> 00:27:34.343]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still gonna be bad in my view.
[00:27:34.343 --> 00:27:35.845]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[00:27:35.845 --> 00:27:37.045]  It's something you need.
[00:27:37.045 --> 00:27:40.388]  We have high-quality, ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast.
[00:27:40.388 --> 00:27:48.074]  And 360 wins, so please take care of your storable food needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[00:27:48.074 --> 00:27:50.876]  It's in great containers, high-quality, lasts 25 years.
[00:27:50.876 --> 00:27:54.879]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.464]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:27:58.464 --> 00:27:58.924]  You're on the air.
[00:27:58.924 --> 00:27:59.485]  Thanks for holding.
[00:27:59.485 --> 00:28:00.547]  Can you hear me?
[00:28:00.547 --> 00:28:01.168]  I sure can, sir.
[00:28:01.168 --> 00:28:01.628]  Thank you.
[00:28:01.628 --> 00:28:02.269]  Hey, Alex.
[00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:05.454]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro.
[00:28:05.454 --> 00:28:08.498]  It's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[00:28:08.498 --> 00:28:09.840]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.443]  I'm calling from New Brent, Connecticut.
[00:28:12.484 --> 00:28:13.946]  I just want to plug in.
[00:28:13.946 --> 00:28:18.370]  I'm a truck driver and two befores have changed the way I drive.
[00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:24.997]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[00:28:24.997 --> 00:28:33.046]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[00:28:33.126 --> 00:28:39.408]  Well brother we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:28:39.408 --> 00:28:41.689]  So this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:55.154]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your truck drivers we love you.
[00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:56.955]  It's finally here.
[00:28:56.955 --> 00:29:01.798]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[00:29:01.798 --> 00:29:08.423]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[00:29:08.423 --> 00:29:10.465]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[00:29:10.465 --> 00:29:19.291]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:26.058]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[00:29:26.058 --> 00:29:27.620]  I can personally feel the difference.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:35.509]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[00:29:35.749 --> 00:29:40.570]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:45.571]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[00:29:45.571 --> 00:29:53.032]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:58.773]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:58.773 --> 00:30:01.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:09.312 --> 00:30:14.796]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Schroer.
[00:30:14.796 --> 00:30:17.578]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:17.578 --> 00:30:19.620]  Alright, let's get into some of this news here.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:30.688]  We're going to be hearing from Alex Jones coming up in the next segment.
[00:30:30.688 --> 00:30:32.490]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.693]  We've got our crew that is in Chaz.
[00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:44.904]  Or CHOP, or maybe they've renamed it now, which is up there in Seattle.
[00:30:44.904 --> 00:30:51.870]  And so we're going to be hearing from them coming up, but it's amazing the silence.
[00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.751]  Are you hearing that?
[00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:54.593]  Because I'm not.
[00:30:54.593 --> 00:31:00.778]  Where is the left and the Democrats and the media in an uproar?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.803]  Photos confirm Chaz Warlord Razz Simone was running guns from the trunk of his Tesla.
[00:31:09.803 --> 00:31:13.024]  And you've got videos of him doing this.
[00:31:13.024 --> 00:31:16.086]  I'd like to know where he got that Tesla.
[00:31:16.086 --> 00:31:27.911]  Now, I'm pretty sure, last I checked, if you buy a new Tesla, you have to put down a pretty significant down payment to Tesla.
[00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:28.051]  Now,
[00:31:30.232 --> 00:31:38.616]  I didn't realize Raz Simone was that successful of a rapper, but people are questioning the legitimacy of that Tesla.
[00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:40.217]  But again, where's David Hogg?
[00:31:40.217 --> 00:31:42.638]  Where are all the marchers?
[00:31:42.638 --> 00:31:44.499]  Where are the anti-gun marchers?
[00:31:44.499 --> 00:31:45.519]  Where are the gun grabbers?
[00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:46.380]  Where are the Democrats?
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.500]  Where are the media?
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.140]  Silent.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:48.461]  Why?
[00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:57.725]  Because this, Chazz, and a vigilante gun
[00:31:59.235 --> 00:32:00.115]  Hand her out-er.
[00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:01.616]  I don't even know what you'd call this.
[00:32:01.616 --> 00:32:04.236]  Gun disbursement.
[00:32:04.236 --> 00:32:08.517]  No, they're silent on that.
[00:32:08.517 --> 00:32:09.777]  And you know, I'll be honest with you.
[00:32:09.777 --> 00:32:12.698]  I'm kind of a Second Amendment purist.
[00:32:12.698 --> 00:32:16.419]  And so, I almost don't even care that he's handing out guns.
[00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:25.181]  But the hypocrisy of the left, it just shows that every movement that the left is involved in is a fraud.
[00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:26.001]  Every movement!
[00:32:27.128 --> 00:32:28.129]  They had all these marches.
[00:32:28.129 --> 00:32:30.050]  What were the marches led by David Hogg?
[00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.591]  What were they guys?
[00:32:31.591 --> 00:32:33.913]  I can't think of the catchphrase.
[00:32:33.913 --> 00:32:35.054]  Our Lives Matter or something.
[00:32:35.054 --> 00:32:37.856]  Does anybody remember that?
[00:32:37.856 --> 00:32:40.038]  People don't even remember it.
[00:32:40.038 --> 00:32:40.738]  Nobody remembers it.
[00:32:40.738 --> 00:32:43.100]  That's how in and out it all is.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.021]  That's how flaky it all is.
[00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:46.923]  It was huge for like three months.
[00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:52.587]  It was the biggest thing with David Hogg and millions of people marching all around the world and book tours and media tours and everything.
[00:32:54.244 --> 00:33:03.326]  But now that their Democrats have taken over Seattle and are just handing out guns to anybody on the street, well, now they're silent.
[00:33:03.326 --> 00:33:06.987]  Seriously, what was the name of that David Ogg marches they used to do across the nation?
[00:33:06.987 --> 00:33:09.587]  They had them here in Austin, they had them all across the nation, folks.
[00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:12.788]  It was a huge thing for about three months.
[00:33:12.788 --> 00:33:14.048]  Nobody can even remember.
[00:33:14.048 --> 00:33:22.270]  That's how... That's how vapid these leftist movements are.
[00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.810]  But you see, they're all connected, folks.
[00:33:25.247 --> 00:33:27.249]  They're all connected.
[00:33:27.249 --> 00:33:29.291]  And the story at Infowars.com highlights it.
[00:33:29.291 --> 00:33:34.896]  UN official admits coronavirus, Black Lives Matter, climate change agendas are inseparable.
[00:33:34.896 --> 00:33:40.842]  Yeah, because they're all run and funded by the same people.
[00:33:40.842 --> 00:33:42.484]  Same with their little gun-grabbing cult.
[00:33:43.766 --> 00:33:46.227]  The little gun march cult.
[00:33:46.227 --> 00:33:47.667]  March for our lives!
[00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:49.247]  That's what it was!
[00:33:49.247 --> 00:33:50.648]  I got it!
[00:33:50.648 --> 00:33:52.468]  March for our lives!
[00:33:52.468 --> 00:34:08.332]  Go ahead guys, plug in March for our lives and you'll get b-roll of thousands of people led by the Democrats, led by the leftist media saying how we need to get guns off the streets, we need gun control, we can't have rifles or any of this stuff.
[00:34:09.605 --> 00:34:19.352]  And then as soon as the Democrat rioters take over a city and start handing out guns like candy, well, they're silent.
[00:34:19.352 --> 00:34:22.975]  Because they're frauds.
[00:34:22.975 --> 00:34:34.504]  Every alphabet soup acronym and movement they come up with at the root of it is all the same, folks.
[00:34:34.504 --> 00:34:35.905]  Anti-American.
[00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:47.752]  The sooner we figure that out and respond accordingly, the better off we will be.
[00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:53.435]  CNN compiles list of unforgivable statues and place names suggesting they should be changed or removed.
[00:34:53.435 --> 00:34:55.176]  Again, what is the ultimate agenda?
[00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:57.478]  Where does this slope end?
[00:34:57.478 --> 00:35:02.181]  Well, no more America.
[00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:05.322]  No more America.
[00:35:05.322 --> 00:35:05.603]  That's
[00:35:06.752 --> 00:35:09.714]  Where the leftist agenda ultimately ends.
[00:35:09.714 --> 00:35:18.281]  But of course now you've got, I mean, I don't believe polls, all these polls, they even run on Fox News saying Biden is beating Trump by like 10 points.
[00:35:18.281 --> 00:35:21.423]  Fox News will probably be anti-Trump by October.
[00:35:21.423 --> 00:35:29.149]  But Gallup Poll finds that only a quarter of Democrats are extremely proud to be American.
[00:35:29.149 --> 00:35:30.610]  No.
[00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.192]  They hate America, folks.
[00:35:33.192 --> 00:35:35.514]  And any of the Democrats that don't hate America,
[00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:44.998]  They're leaving the Democrat Party because they realize that that's what the Democrat Party has become, is the Hate America Party.
[00:35:44.998 --> 00:35:48.221]  Kind of like the media.
[00:35:48.221 --> 00:35:50.082]  Here's the LA Times.
[00:35:50.082 --> 00:35:52.645]  Partygoers have been packing Arizona bars.
[00:35:52.645 --> 00:35:55.067]  Now the state is a coronavirus hotspot.
[00:35:55.067 --> 00:35:57.249]  Oh!
[00:35:57.249 --> 00:35:58.130]  You guys are funny!
[00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:09.778]  I remember that article you wrote about all the riots and looting and arson and all the protesters of George Floyd saying how they're causing a coronavirus outbreak.
[00:36:09.778 --> 00:36:11.399]  Oh wait, you didn't write that article.
[00:36:11.399 --> 00:36:19.745]  It's when there's a Trump rally or Americans wanting to go to a restaurant or a beach that you say, oh, you have to stay inside for coronavirus.
[00:36:19.745 --> 00:36:26.730]  But if it's your protesters out burning and looting and rioting and murdering and raping, well, then that's just fine.
[00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.892]  Hey, if I was a coronavirus, I'd want to avoid those people too.
[00:36:31.854 --> 00:36:38.216]  Breitbart.com, report 34% of Michigan coronavirus deaths linked to nursing homes.
[00:36:38.216 --> 00:36:41.056]  Who sent the COVID into the nursing homes?
[00:36:41.056 --> 00:36:45.357]  That bitch, Gretchen Whitmer.
[00:36:45.357 --> 00:36:50.078]  Whitmer.
[00:36:50.078 --> 00:36:52.599]  That is a sick, sick woman.
[00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:59.481]  I can't believe we have mass murderers holding governorships right now.
[00:36:59.481 --> 00:37:00.801]  Whitmer, Cuomo,
[00:37:02.827 --> 00:37:06.469]  These are mass murderers.
[00:37:06.469 --> 00:37:17.115]  And you know, quite frankly, folks, the fact that we haven't put these people behind bars is almost so pathetic that we don't even deserve this country anymore.
[00:37:17.115 --> 00:37:22.078]  I'm gonna be honest.
[00:37:22.078 --> 00:37:28.382]  The fact that we don't have 10,000 people marching to have Whitmer hauled into a max security prison,
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.961]  And Governor Cuomo hauled into a Mac security prison.
[00:37:32.961 --> 00:37:37.883]  You know, we just brought back federal executions.
[00:37:37.883 --> 00:37:44.105]  Why don't we send a little COVID nursing home to Andrew Cuomo?
[00:37:44.105 --> 00:37:48.726]  Why don't we send a little COVID nursing home to Gretchen Whitmer?
[00:37:48.726 --> 00:37:51.827]  What does that translate to?
[00:37:51.827 --> 00:37:55.389]  Well, you can make the translation yourself.
[00:37:55.389 --> 00:37:56.509]  But no, folks.
[00:37:58.441 --> 00:38:01.963]  I really think we deserve to lose this country.
[00:38:01.963 --> 00:38:23.293]  If we have premeditated killers in governorships and it's just right out there in front of you for all to see, and we don't even organize and march against these people in positions of power, but the media has us marching for a felon, a criminal,
[00:38:27.895 --> 00:38:30.077]  Well, I don't think we deserve America, quite frankly.
[00:38:30.077 --> 00:38:35.802]  85% of independent U.S.
[00:38:35.802 --> 00:38:38.404]  restaurants may close by year-end.
[00:38:38.404 --> 00:38:39.905]  Story at Infowars.com.
[00:38:39.905 --> 00:38:45.450]  Yeah, 24 Hour Fitness is also closing a bunch of gyms, so... I mean, there's the fascism.
[00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.171]  Where's the anti-fascists?
[00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:48.793]  The fascism is the COVID.
[00:38:56.661 --> 00:38:58.163]  Oh, but the economy's doing great.
[00:38:58.163 --> 00:39:01.506]  That's all I'll report on Fox.
[00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:11.555]  And now in California, if you do want to keep your gym open, you basically have to make pods that are separated by some plastic liner or some stupid crap.
[00:39:11.555 --> 00:39:16.240]  Yeah, because everybody loves working out in a plastic bag.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.523]  Wealthy fleeing to mountain resorts as cities burn.
[00:39:20.663 --> 00:39:25.068]  Yeah, there's no doubt there's going to be an exodus from Democrat cities again, folks.
[00:39:25.068 --> 00:39:33.979]  I just wonder, hey look, this is all good, there's silver linings to all this, this is all a long extended political revolution that we're experiencing.
[00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:35.821]  I just don't know if we have time, okay?
[00:39:36.687 --> 00:39:37.327]  I really don't.
[00:39:37.327 --> 00:39:39.049]  We have a media that fakes Russian collusion.
[00:39:39.049 --> 00:39:42.131]  We have Jussie Smolletts that fake hate crimes.
[00:39:42.131 --> 00:39:43.092]  They fake impeachment.
[00:39:43.092 --> 00:39:44.292]  They fake quid pro quo.
[00:39:44.292 --> 00:39:46.154]  They fake pandemics.
[00:39:46.154 --> 00:39:47.615]  I mean, they fake everything, folks.
[00:39:47.615 --> 00:39:52.218]  They have governors that premeditatedly send people infected into nursing homes to kill people.
[00:39:52.218 --> 00:39:54.500]  I mean, these are hardened criminals we need to clear up.
[00:39:55.382 --> 00:39:57.023]  It's finally here.
[00:39:57.023 --> 00:40:01.126]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[00:43:58.316 --> 00:44:00.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:13.152 --> 00:44:21.639]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:44:27.244 --> 00:44:49.622]  John Quisling was the Prime Minister of Norway at the beginning of World War II and he ordered the Norwegian military to stand down and allow Hitler to take over the country and then use that nation as a launch point to launch attacks into other surrounding nations.
[00:44:49.622 --> 00:44:52.044]  We get the word Quisling from
[00:44:53.186 --> 00:44:55.052]  Prime Minister Quisling.
[00:44:55.052 --> 00:44:59.045]  It is the modern parlance for someone at a high level.
[00:45:00.071 --> 00:45:15.161]  In the state apparatus that works for the foreign hostile government to undermine the nation and basically open the drawbridge and allow the enemy in to then set up its own government through the puppet quislings over the population.
[00:45:15.161 --> 00:45:18.504]  Again, quisling did not invent high treason.
[00:45:18.504 --> 00:45:19.704]  Far from it.
[00:45:19.704 --> 00:45:24.408]  It is just simply a more modern case study example.
[00:45:24.408 --> 00:45:27.070]  In fact, Hitler's first big major successes
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.441]  Was through Quislings.
[00:45:29.441 --> 00:45:31.601]  They had Quislings inside the Austrian government.
[00:45:31.601 --> 00:45:36.143]  They had Quislings working inside the Russian government.
[00:45:36.143 --> 00:45:42.466]  They had Quislings on the greatest scale, not in Norway, but in France.
[00:45:42.466 --> 00:45:49.189]  That's why Hitler was able to defeat the French, who he couldn't defeat in World War I, when he himself was just a corporal.
[00:45:49.189 --> 00:45:56.832]  But if you pull back from it, and you look at the model of how the Nazis were able to go in and undermine France,
[00:45:57.552 --> 00:46:23.731]  They were making deals from the time Hitler got in power in 1933 until the time he invaded France in 1940 with the French High Command, that if they let Hitler take over, Hitler would quietly pay them off before the invasion and would set them up in power, moving the main seat of power from Paris to the south of France in Vichy France.
[00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:24.512]  That's why it's called
[00:46:25.526 --> 00:46:28.979]  Vichy France and the traitors of World War Two.
[00:46:28.979 --> 00:46:30.425]  That's why the French...
[00:46:31.448 --> 00:46:41.376]  capitulated was not cowardice of their soldiers but was high treason in the high command of the French government.
[00:46:41.376 --> 00:46:45.999]  That's why it's called high treason because it's going on at the highest levels.
[00:46:45.999 --> 00:46:53.565]  Either attempting to take out the king, the president, or of a president or a king engaged in treason against the nation or the people.
[00:46:53.565 --> 00:46:55.607]  That too is high treason.
[00:46:55.607 --> 00:47:00.251]  It is betraying the people, it is betraying the country, it is betraying the culture and it is the
[00:47:01.613 --> 00:47:01.793]  Yes.
[00:47:18.877 --> 00:47:22.579]  It's classified, but much of it's been declassified, that the U.S.
[00:47:22.579 --> 00:47:44.108]  military, through contacts they had in the Iraqi military, back from when we'd been allied with them during the Iraqi-Iranian War, or the Iran-Iraq War, as it was properly called, and almost all of Saddam's generals also stood down when the main war started, and only a few units and few organizations, like the Republican Guard, put up a fight.
[00:47:44.108 --> 00:47:45.369]  So that's how you win a war.
[00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:54.035]  In most cases, is basically infiltrating and buying off the enemy's high command before a shot is ever fired.
[00:47:54.035 --> 00:47:57.297]  That way, you're insured of being able to control the situation.
[00:47:57.297 --> 00:47:58.558]  So this is done over and over again.
[00:47:58.558 --> 00:48:00.979]  Now, let's look at the United Nations.
[00:48:00.979 --> 00:48:03.581]  Set up by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds on record.
[00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:04.181]  They paid for it.
[00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.121]  That's on record, folks.
[00:48:05.121 --> 00:48:05.902]  Not a conspiracy theory.
[00:48:05.902 --> 00:48:06.963]  Look it up.
[00:48:06.963 --> 00:48:08.443]  In Presidio, San Francisco.
[00:48:08.443 --> 00:48:09.784]  In New York.
[00:48:09.784 --> 00:48:10.805]  In The Hague and The Netherlands.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:19.903]  And once they set all of this up, it was believed for the general public it was about peace and love and helping starving children.
[00:48:19.903 --> 00:48:37.911]  But really it was about setting up a planetary corporate government that could then come back into nation states and begin undermining city, county, and state governments, buying off politicians, and piece by piece taking control through a process called munialization by the United Nations.
[00:48:37.911 --> 00:48:41.253]  And holding all these different organizations and groups together.
[00:48:42.455 --> 00:49:06.924]  via the megabanks endless fiat currency printing that's given to them to have a monopoly of control is big tech five companies funded by the megabanks funded by the same group that created the United Nations to surveil and control and watch our every movement and be able to selectively then only support certain corporations and groups and the key
[00:49:08.127 --> 00:49:22.331]  Censor and suppress the population being able to communicate and try to throw off the bonds of globalism and international corporate fascist control and the communist models they try to impose over their slave colonies.
[00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:27.632]  This is the greatest authoritarian system the planet's ever seen.
[00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:29.073]  It is the most cold-blooded.
[00:49:29.073 --> 00:49:31.313]  It is the most wicked.
[00:49:31.313 --> 00:49:36.515]  Now I'll list some of the other sectors of this system that ties together
[00:49:37.506 --> 00:49:42.611]  With the axes of tyranny supporting it in the fascist structure.
[00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:44.614]  And that's where we are today.
[00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:46.435]  All the major megacorporations.
[00:49:46.435 --> 00:49:48.978]  The entire Fortune 100.
[00:49:48.978 --> 00:49:51.080]  All the major central banks.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.782]  All the major entertainment companies.
[00:49:53.943 --> 00:50:09.829]  All the major universities, the communist Chinese, the unelected tyrannical EU, the America-hating Hollywood, the out-of-control grounds and command bases of oppression and anti-free speech, Marxist-Leninist evil universities, are all
[00:50:10.749 --> 00:50:15.512]  Completely unified behind open world government and the end of the West.
[00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:30.362]  And you notice, as the globalists launch their full worldwide takeover, the Pope is now a Marxist-Leninist, actually undermining classic canon law of the Catholic Church, 180 degrees overthrowing it.
[00:50:30.362 --> 00:50:35.005]  Every major sector has been taken control of by the globalists, and this is 21st century modern
[00:50:37.549 --> 00:51:00.419]  Warfare, but the way to defeat it is to understand it's a full-spectrum Takeover because the central banks control the money and are owned by a handful of families All the other corporations all the other big tech companies all the other media outlets get in line And so that's why you're seeing communist Chinese level censorship all across the Western world against anybody that questions dangerous vaccines
[00:51:00.999 --> 00:51:03.001]  Is anybody that questions open borders?
[00:51:03.001 --> 00:51:06.264]  Is anybody that questions abortion or even forced abortion?
[00:51:06.264 --> 00:51:07.805]  Or anybody that questions censorship?
[00:51:07.805 --> 00:51:09.647]  Or anybody that wants to have sovereignty?
[00:51:09.647 --> 00:51:13.350]  Because this is the new old order emerging.
[00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.833]  They've gone, as David Icke properly says, from hiding it to selling it.
[00:51:17.745 --> 00:51:22.649]  And so remember, that's why you see at the United Nations in New York.
[00:51:22.649 --> 00:51:24.570]  And that's why you see on CNN.
[00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.891]  That's why you see in the news.
[00:51:25.891 --> 00:51:28.093]  Of course, the UN is going to run things.
[00:51:28.093 --> 00:51:31.595]  Of course, the WHO tells us how to handle the COVID hoax.
[00:51:31.595 --> 00:51:40.442]  Of course, we have the strong city program set up by Obama, where the UN is in our cities, basically taking over the police forces.
[00:51:40.962 --> 00:51:55.691]  But first, they've got to sabotage them, undermine them, focus in on a few bad cases, to demonize the police in general, to begin the defunding of them, to break their will, so they will then become clients of the globalists, just as they did in Europe.
[00:51:55.691 --> 00:52:01.515]  But in the case of Europe, Hitler was set up to set up the EU with Edward VIII, the King of England.
[00:52:01.515 --> 00:52:05.558]  He was told in secret British treaties that have now come out, that he would be allowed to do that.
[00:52:06.178 --> 00:52:07.279]  The Nazis were bad guys.
[00:52:23.513 --> 00:52:37.505]  Setting up war, setting up economic collapse, to then knock out the nation state and bring in Marshall Plan type operations to reorganize those countries under debt that the IMF and World Bank, the International Bank of Settlements would give them.
[00:52:37.505 --> 00:52:45.811]  And all this is written about in books by Brzezinski and by Kissinger and by Quigley and in the Council on Foreign Relations bi-monthly publication Foreign Affairs.
[00:52:45.811 --> 00:52:47.092]  It's all there.
[00:52:47.913 --> 00:53:08.818]  And we sit here like ignorant morons wondering why it's all so coordinated and why it's so out of control and why there's open high treason going on and open collaboration at the UN facility with former US Attorney Generals like Loretta Lynch saying the UN is our boss and we're taking over at the city level and once we get rid of the police and put our own people in,
[00:53:10.489 --> 00:53:11.851]  Then they're coming for the guns.
[00:53:11.851 --> 00:53:13.594]  And then they're going to isolate the countryside.
[00:53:13.594 --> 00:53:14.736]  They're going to take full control.
[00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:21.346]  I mean, this is a very systematic plan, similar to what the Bolsheviks did, but much more high-tech.
[00:53:21.346 --> 00:53:24.311]  And that's why they put their people in the military leadership positions.
[00:53:24.311 --> 00:53:25.653]  That's why they've got this whole thing set up.
[00:53:26.783 --> 00:53:35.333]  There is an American resistance, and all of you are part of this, and there's a resistance in Australia and Brazil and Europe, but we have to really get aggressive and call these people out for what they are.
[00:53:35.333 --> 00:53:43.702]  Globalist traitors that are trying to set up a Chinese communist model where billionaires sit offshore, pay no taxes, run slave shops.
[00:53:44.724 --> 00:53:54.055]  Deindustrialize our countries and totally dominate and control us in the name of political correctness, simply playing different ethnic groups off against each other.
[00:53:54.055 --> 00:53:58.660]  It's classical, great game, like the British used in India, divide and conquer strategy.
[00:53:59.582 --> 00:54:03.763]  All right, this is my report on the real meaning of Quisling.
[00:54:03.763 --> 00:54:05.364]  All of you don't need to be useful idiots.
[00:54:05.364 --> 00:54:07.805]  You need to be the leaders you are, and I know you are.
[00:54:07.805 --> 00:54:10.325]  You're the core of the resistance that understands this.
[00:54:10.325 --> 00:54:14.367]  So please, take this live report and share it once we archive it at Bandock Video.
[00:54:14.367 --> 00:54:17.868]  Take it and share it because people need to understand why this is all happening.
[00:54:17.868 --> 00:54:26.690]  The COVID lockdown, round two, all of it is about siege, strangling America, bringing Sardines under UN control.
[00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:28.231]  We are now inside world government.
[00:54:29.005 --> 00:54:37.168]  We need to declare we're under world government and declare that it's illegitimate just like we did on July 4th, 1776 with the Declaration of Independence.
[00:54:37.168 --> 00:54:39.970]  We need a new Declaration of Independence against this tyranny.
[00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:44.331]  But only you can be the standard bearers and carry this message if you choose to be free.
[00:54:44.331 --> 00:54:45.132]  God bless and good luck.
[00:54:45.692 --> 00:54:48.815]  Technology Delivery System.
[00:54:48.815 --> 00:54:50.377]  The first of its kind.
[00:54:50.377 --> 00:54:55.362]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[00:54:55.362 --> 00:54:58.365]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[00:54:58.365 --> 00:55:01.468]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[00:55:01.468 --> 00:55:04.571]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[00:55:04.571 --> 00:55:07.054]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[00:55:07.614 --> 00:55:09.815]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[00:55:09.815 --> 00:55:11.836]  It's great to keep with you.
[00:55:11.836 --> 00:55:18.119]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[00:55:18.119 --> 00:55:19.660]  We're really excited about it.
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.801]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:55:21.801 --> 00:55:33.306]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[00:55:33.766 --> 00:55:47.050]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at Infowarsstore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself.
[00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.350]  This is the end, my friends.
[00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.491]  My only friend's the end.
[00:55:51.491 --> 00:55:54.051]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[00:55:54.051 --> 00:55:57.212]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[00:55:57.212 --> 00:55:58.313]  The safety.
[00:55:58.313 --> 00:55:58.913]  The delusion.
[00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:05.234]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety.
[00:56:05.234 --> 00:56:11.539]  Movies and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[00:56:11.539 --> 00:56:15.242]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[00:56:15.242 --> 00:56:23.287]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states, every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity.
[00:56:24.306 --> 00:56:26.287]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:57:05.762 --> 00:57:08.364]  Alright folks, Alex Jones is coming up in the next segment.
[00:57:08.364 --> 00:57:13.548]  I want to play some videos here before we get to the rest of the news and then I'm hoping we hear from our crew.
[00:57:13.548 --> 00:57:16.390]  Boots on the ground from Chaz Chop.
[00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:19.592]  And then also your phone calls in the third hour.
[00:57:19.592 --> 00:57:24.616]  I want to dedicate the entire third hour to your phone calls.
[00:57:24.616 --> 00:57:27.638]  Let me just
[00:57:31.528 --> 00:57:33.049]  Roll some of this B-roll.
[00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:36.270]  First, let's go to the one in the audio, in clip seven.
[00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:39.731]  I assume we have this censored, guys.
[00:57:39.731 --> 00:57:49.794]  So, folks, this is sad, but the media is bringing back racism.
[00:57:49.794 --> 00:57:54.535]  And it's specifically being aimed and targeted against white people.
[00:57:54.535 --> 00:57:56.316]  And so this weekend alone,
[00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:04.314]  You had a series of hate crime attacks, if you believe in that notion, when it comes to race and skin color, against white people.
[00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:09.456]  Now, I want to just show an example of these, one with audio, and then we'll just read the B-roll.
[00:58:09.456 --> 00:58:25.844]  But listen, this is a young black guy who is either watching these kids or somehow with these kids, and there's one white kid and three young black kids, and then one older kid recording, encouraging the black kids to beat up the white kid and steal his bike.
[00:58:25.844 --> 00:58:26.505]  Here's the video.
[00:58:27.714 --> 00:58:29.295]  Bitch, I'm an honest bitch!
[00:58:29.295 --> 00:58:35.177]  I don't have a problem with you.
[00:58:35.177 --> 00:58:38.038]  So then the young girl starts beating him.
[00:58:38.038 --> 00:58:42.619]  Steal his bike, kicking him in the head on the ground.
[00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:44.980]  Stomping on him, and it's all being encouraged.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.161]  He rode off that nigga bike!
[00:58:48.161 --> 00:58:51.762]  By the guy who's filming it, who's obviously an older kid.
[00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:06.691]  And the guy's just standing there watching it, encouraging it.
[00:59:06.691 --> 00:59:12.833]  It's all been justified and it's all been instigated by the media.
[00:59:12.833 --> 00:59:14.173]  Alright guys, go ahead and pull that down.
[00:59:14.173 --> 00:59:20.415]  I don't take pleasure watching this or reporting this to you folks.
[00:59:20.415 --> 00:59:23.696]  I don't like getting involved with all the race baiting and all the division, but
[00:59:24.718 --> 00:59:30.047]  They're never going to show you this on the mainstream news because this is the product of the mainstream news.
[00:59:30.047 --> 00:59:31.870]  Let's just go ahead and roll some of this other stuff.
[00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:34.635]  Let's go, just roll clip one.
[00:59:34.635 --> 00:59:38.241]  This was at a Maryland pier.
[00:59:40.505 --> 00:59:51.690]  And you had a bunch of people out there, BLM protesters for George Floyd, and then all of a sudden the crowd just decided to aim itself against whatever white people they could find.
[00:59:51.690 --> 01:00:01.815]  And so if God forbid you were one of the white people in this crowd of mostly black people, you got targeted for getting your ass beat.
[01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:03.656]  And so this is all on footage here.
[01:00:03.656 --> 01:00:06.097]  And you can tell not everybody wants to get involved.
[01:00:06.097 --> 01:00:08.518]  In fact, a lot of the people are like, hey, don't do this stuff, man.
[01:00:08.518 --> 01:00:09.619]  We're not out here to be racist.
[01:00:11.254 --> 01:00:19.339]  Just like what happens with every other mob, the most vitriolic and violent ones always seem to take the lead.
[01:00:19.339 --> 01:00:24.843]  And so there you go, there's another victim of racism.
[01:00:24.843 --> 01:00:28.705]  The white guy gets targeted for being white.
[01:00:28.705 --> 01:00:31.647]  Okay, so again, that was from this weekend.
[01:00:31.647 --> 01:00:36.270]  Let's see, what else do we have here?
[01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.471]  What is clip two, guys?
[01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:38.172]  I don't even know.
[01:00:38.172 --> 01:00:40.013]  This doesn't seem...
[01:00:43.613 --> 01:00:44.433]  Oh!
[01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:46.454]  Oh yeah, let's roll clip two.
[01:00:46.454 --> 01:00:51.176]  Here's a nice young man who sees a 92-year-old white woman walking down the street.
[01:00:51.176 --> 01:00:55.998]  A young black kid punches her in the face and then she falls over.
[01:00:55.998 --> 01:01:00.220]  This happened in New York this weekend.
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:01.620]  Now, isn't the media going to show you that?
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:05.562]  I wonder why he did that.
[01:01:05.562 --> 01:01:08.283]  Why do you think he punched that old white lady?
[01:01:08.283 --> 01:01:10.804]  I'm sure it wasn't because she was white.
[01:01:10.804 --> 01:01:12.505]  He probably just didn't like her pink sweater.
[01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:19.172]  He thought, oh, oh, he thought she was with the rival gang.
[01:01:19.172 --> 01:01:20.653]  Oh.
[01:01:20.653 --> 01:01:22.234]  Easy mistake.
[01:01:22.234 --> 01:01:23.094]  Easy mistake to make.
[01:01:23.094 --> 01:01:28.038]  That 92-year-old white woman, she could have been with that rival gang, and so he punched her in the face and knocked her over.
[01:01:28.038 --> 01:01:29.099]  That's nice.
[01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:32.281]  Guys, go ahead and just roll clip 3 as we go out.
[01:01:32.281 --> 01:01:33.142]  Heck, roll clip 5.
[01:01:33.142 --> 01:01:38.065]  You know, this is just some of the peaceful protesting we're seeing from Black Lives Matter.
[01:01:38.065 --> 01:01:39.406]  Very, very peaceful.
[01:01:39.406 --> 01:01:41.408]  Go ahead and roll clip 5, guys.
[01:01:41.408 --> 01:01:42.589]  Let's get a little clip 5 in here.
[01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:44.190]  Let's show it a little here.
[01:01:45.104 --> 01:01:46.525]  Oh, oh, this was the guy.
[01:01:46.525 --> 01:01:52.310]  Oh, oh, this guy did not get treated too well when he went into Trump country as a liberal.
[01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:54.912]  They kicked him out.
[01:01:54.912 --> 01:02:11.645]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the race riot hoax of 2020.
[01:02:13.462 --> 01:02:15.023]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:21.769]  Well, I can tell you, it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:27.093]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[01:02:27.093 --> 01:02:29.575]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[01:02:29.575 --> 01:02:30.396]  That's why now,
[01:02:31.036 --> 01:02:41.027]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[01:02:41.027 --> 01:02:45.191]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[01:02:45.191 --> 01:02:49.436]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[01:02:49.436 --> 01:02:52.439]  InfoWars.com lives!
[01:03:14.801 --> 01:03:22.885]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:03:22.885 --> 01:03:23.765]  Move bitch!
[01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:24.405]  Get out the way!
[01:03:26.963 --> 01:03:33.128]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[01:03:33.128 --> 01:03:37.391]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:03:37.391 --> 01:03:41.214]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:03:41.214 --> 01:03:42.535]  I will not let you down.
[01:03:42.535 --> 01:03:45.658]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:47.339]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:03:47.339 --> 01:03:49.361]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:03:49.361 --> 01:03:53.064]  This means that Donald Trump will be supporting Alex Jones.
[01:03:56.536 --> 01:04:15.682]  The post-humanists built their world-wide architecture of control and surveillance in quasi-secret circumstances, but now that they're going to implement the actual control grid and leave beta and go into operational, they're out in the open.
[01:04:15.682 --> 01:04:21.564]  There's an article from the London Guardian linked at InfoWars.com with an extensive report by RT
[01:04:23.442 --> 01:04:47.422]  We're the top UN official over a major UN department admits that this is all just a dress rehearsal practicing clamping down on society and that the COVID response have been directed by the WHO and yes of course the response to saying America's racist and evil and taking control of police departments is also being directed by the UN.
[01:04:47.422 --> 01:04:48.744]  Go read the interview
[01:04:50.325 --> 01:04:50.625]  I think?
[01:05:05.643 --> 01:05:10.207]  When I even talk to Congress people off record, they can't believe I know all this.
[01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:14.091]  Why wouldn't I know who rules the Earth?
[01:05:14.091 --> 01:05:25.983]  Especially when you find out they're a bunch of murdering control freaks who are setting up a planetary government to carry out forced depopulation, dumbing down the breakdown of the family, their operating system,
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:31.404]  It's satanism and pedophilia and they're now externalizing it.
[01:05:31.404 --> 01:05:35.768]  All over the news, all over TV saying Democrats kill babies as an act of power.
[01:05:35.768 --> 01:05:36.549]  We enjoy it.
[01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:37.310]  We love the devil.
[01:05:38.248 --> 01:05:41.609]  Suddenly Satanists are coming out in front of their rocks all over the place.
[01:05:41.609 --> 01:05:43.910]  Businesses in Austin are saying, no Christians allowed.
[01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:44.911]  We worship Satan.
[01:05:44.911 --> 01:05:47.512]  I mean, it's on, folks.
[01:05:47.512 --> 01:05:48.692]  It's on.
[01:05:48.692 --> 01:05:50.433]  But still people are fat, dumb, and happy.
[01:05:50.433 --> 01:05:53.714]  We'll wait till the clear evidence of the depression hits.
[01:05:53.714 --> 01:05:55.875]  Let me read over this article.
[01:05:55.875 --> 01:06:01.157]  UN official admits coronavirus, Black Lives Matter, climate change agendas are inseparable.
[01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:02.518]  Calls coronavirus pandemic.
[01:06:03.895 --> 01:06:04.235]  I think?
[01:06:20.547 --> 01:06:28.689]  And again, just like the WHO is over all your health care, this is over what your business is allowed to do and what sustainability is.
[01:06:28.689 --> 01:06:31.890]  Wonder why you've got all those paper straws now?
[01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:32.330]  It's these folks.
[01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:44.584]  They don't care about China dumping 90% of the waste in the ocean that's actually killing everything.
[01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.645]  They just don't want you to have plastic.
[01:06:46.645 --> 01:07:03.472]  Lise Kingo, Executive Director of the UN Global Compact, insisted in an interview with Guardian that there were very, very clear connections linking the current health crisis, climate change issues, and the Black Lives Matter protests that have spread across the globe.
[01:07:03.472 --> 01:07:07.694]  The coronavirus pandemic is, quote, just a fire drill for what's coming, she told the New Zealand.
[01:07:08.174 --> 01:07:21.658]  Government actions purportedly taken to stop the spread of the virus have crippled economies across the globe, and it's been attributed to widespread social unrest, making her warning particularly sobering, wrote the Guardian.
[01:07:21.658 --> 01:07:32.581]  According to the UN official, who just always know what's coming because they're behind it, issues surrounding inequality are, quote, part of the sustainable development agenda.
[01:07:33.996 --> 01:07:40.442]  Again, they shut down the economy in the third world and first world, create mass death, and then they manage the crisis into the next leg.
[01:07:40.442 --> 01:07:51.433]  She added that their only way forward is to create a world that leaves no one behind when the UN, again, is literally exterminating people all over the planet for their land and running policies to kill them.
[01:07:51.433 --> 01:07:57.640]  Kim Goh also argued that the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd at the hands of police exposed a horrible racism.
[01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:05.411]  Meanwhile, the UN killed over a million people in Africa, in Rwanda alone, in the world, and that human rights were inseparable.
[01:08:05.411 --> 01:08:06.853]  I want to say something right now.
[01:08:06.853 --> 01:08:10.759]  Black lives matter only matter if white people are involved.
[01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:17.295]  But when the UN is murdering people, most of the peacekeepers by the way are not white, it's wonderful and loving.
[01:08:17.295 --> 01:08:18.756]  This is sick.
[01:08:18.756 --> 01:08:21.258]  Black lives matter only when white people are involved.
[01:08:21.258 --> 01:08:29.505]  But again, she said George Floyd at the hands of police exposed horrible racism in the world and that human rights were inseparable from dealing with climate issues.
[01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:36.491]  She encouraged CEOs, that's who run the UN, and business owners to become social activists, which you all see them doing in unison, claiming that
[01:08:37.472 --> 01:08:41.675]  Young people would not want to work for them unless they understand social equality.
[01:08:41.675 --> 01:08:44.797]  It's actually the corporations making you understand the social equality.
[01:08:44.797 --> 01:08:50.420]  Tim Cook runs giant slave camps at Apple, but he tells you Black Lives Matter need to overthrow the United States.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:57.724]  Although she didn't elaborate on exactly how Black Lives Matter demonstrations relate to climate change, it appears that many activists have already made the connection.
[01:08:57.724 --> 01:09:05.309]  Last week, climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion targeted Cambridge University's vandalizing a college building and protesting against a memorial
[01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:05.969]  We're good.
[01:09:16.055 --> 01:09:21.958]  Postulated that civilization fall because of people low genetic value have more children than people with high genetic value.
[01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:22.919]  But wait a minute.
[01:09:22.919 --> 01:09:26.041]  It's the actual eugenicists that are running this operation.
[01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:29.563]  But it's an even higher level eugenics where they actually target the smartest people.
[01:09:29.563 --> 01:09:35.966]  And then believe they'll just call the dumb off once they've captured and taken control of the intelligent so that they can control the future.
[01:09:35.966 --> 01:09:38.728]  But first the globalists want to win that leg of the attack.
[01:09:38.728 --> 01:09:42.230]  And I think one of my greatest contributions has been exposing that real paradigm.
[01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:43.511]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:09:43.991 --> 01:09:52.614]  There are huge articles up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com right now that detail what's really happening.
[01:09:52.614 --> 01:09:53.635]  85% of independent U.S.
[01:09:53.635 --> 01:09:58.336]  restaurants are going to close by the end of the year, the major restaurant association is saying.
[01:09:58.336 --> 01:09:59.717]  That's the plan.
[01:09:59.717 --> 01:10:04.999]  But the big corporations, they all just get basically free loans and they are just standby.
[01:10:05.919 --> 01:10:13.502]  And then make you buy their grocery stores, their restaurants, their facilities, but they're going to add social controls to what you can do.
[01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:21.344]  This is about knocking out not just the underground economy, but the middle class infrastructure, which has been the main globalist goal all along.
[01:10:21.344 --> 01:10:29.027]  Meanwhile, they will ban the Second Amendment in all the blue zones, but then allow their operatives to operate above the law.
[01:10:29.027 --> 01:10:31.288]  Another big article up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:32.248 --> 01:10:39.552]  Photos confirm Chaz Warlord, Raz Simone, was running guns from the truck of his Tesla.
[01:10:39.552 --> 01:10:40.912]  But that's okay.
[01:10:40.912 --> 01:10:47.996]  Illegally selling guns out of the back of the car, so you can then set up checkpoints and enslave people and get extortion money, is okay.
[01:10:47.996 --> 01:10:51.758]  Because it's actual racketeering, actual mafia, actual terrorism.
[01:10:52.278 --> 01:10:57.602]  But when good citizens come out in their neighborhoods and stop looting by simply being armed, they're terrorists on the news.
[01:10:57.602 --> 01:10:58.843]  You say, well, this doesn't make sense.
[01:10:58.843 --> 01:11:05.488]  There's a war on logic saying there's not two sexes, saying Trump can't have a rally, but Democrats can all have rallies.
[01:11:05.488 --> 01:11:13.475]  This system is run by twisted psychologists and psychiatrists, and they understand that what they're pushing isn't logical for the general public.
[01:11:13.475 --> 01:11:14.576]  It's enslavement.
[01:11:14.576 --> 01:11:15.937]  So they are burning out
[01:11:16.437 --> 01:11:28.190]  Your receptor sites, they are conditioning you to just see absolutely insane Mad Hatter Tea Party stuff, so you finally just get desensitized and go into learned helplessness.
[01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.232]  That's why you can't just tune out from it.
[01:11:30.232 --> 01:11:31.574]  It's designed to make you tune out.
[01:11:32.034 --> 01:11:35.315]  Then the weight crushes you mentally, spiritually, and culturally.
[01:11:35.315 --> 01:11:38.016]  You must energize against the threat.
[01:11:38.016 --> 01:11:41.697]  Use it as psychological and psychic weight that you then push.
[01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:47.699]  And then, like a CrossFitter or somebody that exercises a lot, you get stronger, not weaker.
[01:11:47.699 --> 01:11:50.480]  That's what this is all about.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.021]  You adapt and you overcome.
[01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:54.282]  You don't adapt by submitting.
[01:11:54.282 --> 01:12:00.344]  Because in the endgame, this is not where you're just going along to get along, like Confucius said, like grass in the wind.
[01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:05.729]  This is stopping the grass all being burned down and completely destroyed.
[01:12:05.729 --> 01:12:08.172]  Ladies and gentlemen, think about what we just covered.
[01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:25.197]  The UN head official, out of UNESCO, setting the policies worldwide for businesses under sustainability that really just mean feudalism, that they control what you can do, is saying that this is about teaching you to have less because the third world doesn't have anything.
[01:12:25.197 --> 01:12:30.559]  When in truth, when you shut off the first world's economy, it destroys the third world.
[01:12:30.559 --> 01:12:36.422]  But now that the populations are dying in mass in the third world, 100 plus million starving to death now, according to the UN themselves,
[01:12:37.617 --> 01:12:53.219]  Now they're going to open the borders up more and hit us with these giant starving third world populations and then quote make us take care of the very people they just disenfranchised and all of it built on a Bill and Melinda Gates NGO, WHO, COVID-19, galactic-sized fraud.
[01:12:54.449 --> 01:12:59.113]  House flies defecate every four to five minutes, spreading diseases and germs.
[01:12:59.113 --> 01:13:02.895]  Protect your food and your health with Bug Assault.

[01:13:22.325 --> 01:13:26.269]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:31.355]  And so, populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[01:13:31.355 --> 01:13:42.266]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:51.474]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[01:13:51.474 --> 01:13:58.100]  He must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.401]  The police have a lot of problems.
[01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:00.762]  We all have a lot of problems.
[01:14:00.762 --> 01:14:03.525]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[01:14:03.525 --> 01:14:05.607]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[01:14:06.445 --> 01:14:10.469]  They are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[01:14:10.469 --> 01:14:14.253]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[01:14:14.253 --> 01:14:16.415]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[01:14:16.415 --> 01:14:20.880]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.921]  InfoWars.com
[01:14:23.211 --> 01:14:24.231]  It's finally here.
[01:14:24.231 --> 01:14:29.073]  Introducing the first of its kind, nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:35.695]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[01:14:35.695 --> 01:14:37.735]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[01:14:37.735 --> 01:14:46.558]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[01:14:46.818 --> 01:14:53.325]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[01:14:53.325 --> 01:14:54.906]  I can personally feel the difference.
[01:14:54.906 --> 01:15:03.034]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[01:15:03.034 --> 01:15:07.459]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.

[01:15:26.153 --> 01:15:28.775]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:45.512]  Big Brother.
[01:15:45.512 --> 01:15:47.313]  Mainstream media.
[01:15:47.313 --> 01:15:49.194]  Government cover-ups.
[01:15:49.194 --> 01:15:50.895]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:15:50.895 --> 01:15:52.556]  Well, so does he.
[01:15:52.556 --> 01:15:57.239]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:16:02.137 --> 01:16:03.619]  I know Roger Stone personally.
[01:16:03.619 --> 01:16:14.650]  I've known him for many years and I was there when WikiLeaks refused to talk to him when he tried to get messages to Julian Assange through Randy Credico.
[01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:21.397]  And now because he helped get President Trump elected three and a half years ago,
[01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:44.657]  He is facing a prison sentence for thought crime that has been ordered by the corrupt evil judge, Judge Amy Berman Jackson in D.C., the swamp creature, to a quote COVID infested prison when Harvey Weinstein, all his other people convicted of rape have been let out of jail because of COVID-19.
[01:16:46.599 --> 01:16:49.442]  Now again, we know COVID-19 is massively exaggerated.
[01:16:49.442 --> 01:16:54.806]  We know that if you have your zinc and you have your vitamin D3 and you have things, that's very hard to get it.
[01:16:54.806 --> 01:16:56.588]  But it is a bad pneumonia.
[01:16:56.588 --> 01:17:00.732]  And the point is they're letting hardened criminals out of jail.
[01:17:00.732 --> 01:17:02.113]  And sending Roger Stone is almost 70.
[01:17:03.479 --> 01:17:05.320]  It does have some health issues in the prison.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:12.222]  That on top of the fact that he's done nothing wrong shows you the total and complete hypocrisy.
[01:17:12.222 --> 01:17:16.924]  We need attention on this very, very important story.
[01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:29.489]  So from now until the day he reports to prison, the next 15 days we'll have a daily countdown at newswars.com and infowars.com and articles on the site explaining what's happening because they can do this to him.
[01:17:29.489 --> 01:17:30.169]  They can do it to anybody.
[01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:34.733]  We need him to be pardoned, or he needs clemency now.
[01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:38.155]  And the illegal orders of the judge silencing him need to stop.
[01:17:38.155 --> 01:17:41.217]  We need to say no political prisoners in America.
[01:17:41.217 --> 01:17:43.218]  Oh, abolish the police, the Democrats say.
[01:17:43.218 --> 01:17:44.099]  They just mean have the U.N.
[01:17:44.099 --> 01:17:44.979]  take it over.
[01:17:44.979 --> 01:17:49.842]  But be sure and throw everybody else in prison who's only stood up for this country.
[01:17:49.842 --> 01:17:51.023]  That's his only crime.
[01:17:51.023 --> 01:17:51.923]  Fifteen days.
[01:17:51.923 --> 01:17:57.247]  Countdown to the deep state death sentence unless President Trump intervenes with a pardon or
[01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:07.674]  If he commutes the sentence of Roger Stone, he will be sent to COVID-19-infested prison at age 67, where they hope he will die.
[01:18:07.674 --> 01:18:10.735]  Ladies and gentlemen, we need to stand up for Roger.
[01:18:10.735 --> 01:18:12.015]  We need to stand up for Julian Assange.
[01:18:12.015 --> 01:18:15.276]  We need to stand up for so many other political prisoners.
[01:18:15.276 --> 01:18:18.978]  Once they shut down what's left of the media under this total censorship, they're going to come after everybody.
[01:18:19.878 --> 01:18:28.303]  Tucker Carlson was absolutely right when he said, when the George Soros funded BLM is done overthrowing the police, they're going to come for all of us next.
[01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:31.105]  Not the black people, but the globalists that control it.
[01:18:31.105 --> 01:18:32.286]  That's what this is.
[01:18:32.286 --> 01:18:33.026]  It's a takeover.
[01:18:33.026 --> 01:18:37.850]  The UN has even come out and admitted that they're behind BLM and behind the COVID hoax.
[01:18:39.162 --> 01:18:41.043]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:18:41.043 --> 01:18:43.323]  And again, not that the virus isn't real.
[01:18:43.323 --> 01:18:45.064]  The response is a hoax.
[01:18:45.064 --> 01:18:48.004]  Clamping down on our freedoms, staying six feet apart.
[01:18:48.004 --> 01:18:50.065]  All of this is designed to destroy the economy.
[01:18:50.065 --> 01:18:53.746]  The UN head official gave an interview to The Guardian and admitted it.
[01:18:53.746 --> 01:18:55.766]  They said it's about lowering our carbon footprint.
[01:18:55.766 --> 01:18:56.986]  It's incredible.
[01:18:56.986 --> 01:19:00.227]  But again, Roger Stone, 15 days.
[01:19:00.227 --> 01:19:04.208]  15 days until he faces that potential death sentence.
[01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:07.129]  We'll continue to have the countdown here every day on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:09.019 --> 01:19:12.290]  Alright, we'll be hearing again from Alex coming up in the next segment.
[01:19:13.971 --> 01:19:18.754]  I want to remind folks about the specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:32.023]  60% off some of the top-selling, top-rated supplements at InfoWarsStore.com, like the Real Red Pill and the Real Red Pill Plus, Bio, True, Selenium, TurboForce, and other supplements at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:32.023 --> 01:19:33.724]  Don't forget about the t-shirts.
[01:19:33.724 --> 01:19:36.186]  Don't forget about the emergency food supplies.
[01:19:36.186 --> 01:19:40.029]  Don't forget about the water filters, the air filters, the shower filters.
[01:19:40.689 --> 01:20:05.818]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com and it's your support at InfoWarsStore.com that keeps us on air because you know that television news is untrustable and you know really at this point most television news is completely most mainstream news is just completely irredeemable folks what they've done
[01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:19.134]  And so that's why it's so important to support InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com as we are the most attacked and villainized by the establishment in the news media.
[01:20:19.134 --> 01:20:35.499]  That's because we are the biggest stopgap in the way of total media control over the narrative and over reality, which they have
[01:20:36.886 --> 01:20:39.727]  Pretty strong control over, folks.
[01:20:39.727 --> 01:20:44.768]  And the censorship that we've endured has not helped.
[01:20:44.768 --> 01:20:48.489]  And so, we'll get to that in a second.
[01:20:48.489 --> 01:20:49.770]  And Alex Jones is coming back.
[01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:54.151]  But you know, I can't help but laugh.
[01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:58.992]  This is a real story from the New York Times today.
[01:20:58.992 --> 01:21:00.553]  Try to bear with me.
[01:21:00.553 --> 01:21:01.853]  See if you can wrap your mind around this.
[01:21:03.049 --> 01:21:09.594]  Headline Flushing the toilet may fling coronavirus aerosols all over.
[01:21:17.383 --> 01:21:23.488]  Here's one more behavior to be hyper aware of in order to prevent coronavirus transmission.
[01:21:23.488 --> 01:21:26.030]  What to do after you use the toilet.
[01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:40.481]  Scientists have found that in addition to clearing out whatever business you've left behind, flushing a toilet can generate a cloud of aerosol droplets that rises nearly three feet.
[01:21:40.481 --> 01:21:47.066]  These droplets may linger in the air long enough to be inhaled by a shared toilet's next user or land on surfaces in the bathroom.
[01:21:50.996 --> 01:21:53.537]  This toilet plume isn't just gross.
[01:21:53.537 --> 01:22:03.801]  In simulations, it can carry infectious coronavirus particles that are already present in the surrounding air or recently shed in a person's stool.
[01:22:03.801 --> 01:22:07.703]  New York Times literally writing about poop.
[01:22:07.703 --> 01:22:17.287]  The research, published Tuesday in the journal Physics of Fluids, adds to growing evidence that the coronavirus can be passed not only through respiratory droplets but through virus-laden feces too.
[01:22:22.811 --> 01:22:26.413]  What will they do next?
[01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:27.314]  What will they do next?
[01:22:27.314 --> 01:22:43.484]  You know, the funny thing about this, I remember reading, this is so long ago, I remember reading a story about this, um, how basically feces droplets end up all over in the bathroom, and that's why you shouldn't leave your toothbrush out.
[01:22:43.484 --> 01:22:44.804]  But this is next level.
[01:22:44.804 --> 01:22:47.106]  So, hey, you know what?
[01:22:48.849 --> 01:22:52.492]  We should probably just ban going to the bathroom altogether.
[01:22:52.492 --> 01:22:57.736]  I think that's the only answer.
[01:22:57.736 --> 01:23:02.640]  Or maybe the only safe place to go to the bathroom is like out in the woods.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:08.425]  And so once you finish your business, you just, you know, shovel some dirt over it.
[01:23:08.425 --> 01:23:16.772]  Because if you go to the bathroom and you use modern day plumbing, well, that's probably white privilege, but you're also spreading COVID.
[01:23:19.904 --> 01:23:26.486]  And you know, if you dare, if you dare fart ever, you're probably spreading COVID.
[01:23:26.486 --> 01:23:29.307]  So think about that now.
[01:23:29.307 --> 01:23:34.289]  We're talking about rectum, rectal transmission of COVID now.
[01:23:34.289 --> 01:23:40.110]  We're talking about fart transplants.
[01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:47.873]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the New York Times is warning you not to flush your toilet because you could be
[01:23:49.278 --> 01:23:56.383]  Getting some feces droplets that contain COVID.
[01:23:56.383 --> 01:24:02.026]  If this isn't the clown world, I really don't know what is.
[01:24:02.026 --> 01:24:07.109]  Coming back on the other side, Alex Jones is going to be breaking down a powerful Tucker Carlson segment.
[01:24:12.082 --> 01:24:13.964]  Folks, the left is out of control.
[01:24:13.964 --> 01:24:16.927]  It's time to start preparing yourselves.
[01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:18.068]  Whatever that means.
[01:24:18.068 --> 01:24:21.851]  Getting on your knees and praying to God, getting more guns, getting emergency food, now's the time.
[01:24:21.851 --> 01:24:26.255]  Hello, Rob Dew here with InfoWarsStore.com and I've got some good news and some bad news.
[01:24:26.255 --> 01:24:30.019]  The bad news is our original mega flash specials have ended at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:25:16.384 --> 01:25:21.590]  Our original Mega Flash specials have ended, but our new DE specials have launched at InfoWareStore.com!
[01:25:22.529 --> 01:25:24.171]  It's finally here.
[01:25:24.171 --> 01:25:28.295]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[01:25:28.295 --> 01:25:34.641]  Available now for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:25:34.641 --> 01:25:44.069]  Listeners have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive Deep Earth Crystal Nascent Iodine.
[01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:59.395]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into the ultimate spray formula.
[01:25:59.395 --> 01:26:07.478]  Iodine is an essential mineral that helps support thyroid health, healthy metabolism, and healthy cognitive function.
[01:26:08.158 --> 01:26:15.742]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 Spray for 33% off intro pricing at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:26:15.742 --> 01:26:19.704]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:26:22.441 --> 01:26:32.370]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[01:26:32.370 --> 01:26:36.213]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[01:26:36.213 --> 01:26:42.819]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[01:26:43.539 --> 01:26:48.942]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[01:26:48.942 --> 01:26:51.543]  You must decide which side you're on.
[01:26:51.543 --> 01:26:59.808]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[01:26:59.808 --> 01:27:05.031]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:06.592]  The delusions must end now.
[01:27:07.552 --> 01:27:12.935]  InfoWars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[01:27:12.935 --> 01:27:16.878]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[01:27:16.878 --> 01:27:18.218]  They are truly fools.
[01:27:18.218 --> 01:27:24.902]  We must fight this, or lose our souls.
[01:27:24.902 --> 01:27:27.524]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:34.985 --> 01:27:39.170]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:27:39.170 --> 01:27:41.933]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:27:52.068 --> 01:27:55.970]  Black Lives Matter is now more popular than the President of the United States.
[01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.811]  And not slightly more popular than the President.
[01:27:58.811 --> 01:28:00.552]  Much more popular.
[01:28:00.552 --> 01:28:02.473]  Tucker Carlson is right.
[01:28:02.473 --> 01:28:09.377]  Black Lives Matter has always been a political party openly funded by George Soros and the Democratic Party.
[01:28:10.097 --> 01:28:19.727]  That's why the majority of the money raised by Black Lives Matter and George Floyd is being directed to the Democratic Party publicly as campaign donations.
[01:28:19.727 --> 01:28:25.934]  It's because we've put up with the criminal activity of the DNC, Soros, and others for decades.
[01:28:26.915 --> 01:28:30.197]  They act above the law.
[01:28:30.197 --> 01:28:43.666]  And then they have all the Republican establishment types come out and endorse Black Lives Matter and the statistically almost non-existent event of a police officer wrongly shooting and killing a black man.
[01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:46.888]  Again, happens about 14 times a year on average.
[01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.850]  It's in the FBI's own statistics.
[01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:52.973]  But just like COVID-19, it is a giant hoax.
[01:28:52.973 --> 01:28:56.715]  And so the entire political agenda of BLM, Planned Parenthood,
[01:28:57.095 --> 01:28:59.658]  Exterminating mainly black people.
[01:28:59.658 --> 01:29:00.459]  Open borders.
[01:29:00.459 --> 01:29:01.560]  Globalism.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.122]  An end of the nuclear family.
[01:29:04.122 --> 01:29:07.786]  These are all official Black Lives Matter policies.
[01:29:07.786 --> 01:29:09.407]  Abolishing the police.
[01:29:09.407 --> 01:29:10.769]  They mean having the UN take it over.
[01:29:11.966 --> 01:29:24.774]  These are all globalist UN New World Order operations, and the UN head of sustainability has even come out and said they're directing it, and they're directing COVID.
[01:29:24.774 --> 01:29:27.635]  So yes, Tucker Carlson's right.
[01:29:27.635 --> 01:29:29.977]  Black Lives Matter is a political party.
[01:29:29.977 --> 01:29:36.861]  It's a political party of the UN and the globalists, and their client party, the Democrats, just like their client party in England, Labor.
[01:29:38.211 --> 01:29:51.280]  That are overthrowing the nation state and exacerbating racial tensions and blaming local government when things go wrong knowing all the police have body cams and every few weeks or so there's going to be a tragic event.
[01:29:52.188 --> 01:29:58.954]  They can then blow that up, project that onto anybody that's white, and the average white American goes, well, I'm not racist.
[01:29:58.954 --> 01:29:59.695]  Sure.
[01:29:59.695 --> 01:30:02.037]  I'll say Black Lives Matter.
[01:30:02.037 --> 01:30:03.178]  Not all lives matter.
[01:30:03.178 --> 01:30:08.923]  I'll say that Black Lives Matter, the political party, has total power and control.
[01:30:08.923 --> 01:30:11.165]  I won't question anything it says.
[01:30:11.886 --> 01:30:24.792]  So it's really mega-corporations that run slave camps around the country and around the world, like Nike and Apple and all the rest of it, deflecting away from the fact that they're total tyrants and getting us all to fight with each other.
[01:30:24.792 --> 01:30:27.334]  So here's part of Tucker Carlson's powerful report.
[01:30:27.334 --> 01:30:30.535]  The full report's on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:30:30.535 --> 01:30:34.597]  We'll go back to Owen Schroyer and the great crew and all the work they're doing.
[01:30:34.597 --> 01:30:36.178]  But this is fundamental.
[01:30:36.178 --> 01:30:40.040]  It's not just a political party that's got an almost 70% approval rating.
[01:30:40.931 --> 01:30:50.731]  It is a movement, a globalist system to destroy our country and to make you swear allegiance to it and even get on your knees or your belly.
[01:30:50.731 --> 01:30:51.553]  It's called slavery.
[01:30:52.568 --> 01:30:54.750]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:58.174]  Here's some bracing news we never expected to report.
[01:30:58.174 --> 01:31:02.078]  Black Lives Matter is now more popular than the President of the United States.
[01:31:02.078 --> 01:31:06.362]  And not slightly more popular than the President, much more popular.
[01:31:06.362 --> 01:31:10.606]  A survey this week by Rasmussen, a right-leaning pollster, found that 62% of likely voters
[01:31:12.168 --> 01:31:15.391]  Now have a favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter.
[01:31:15.391 --> 01:31:18.533]  At the same time, Rasmussen found that Donald Trump's approval rating was 43%.
[01:31:18.533 --> 01:31:21.396]  That's almost 20 points lower.
[01:31:21.396 --> 01:31:22.777]  And by the way, Trump was not alone.
[01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:26.580]  Black Lives Matter is far more popular than Joe Biden is, too.
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.322]  It's more popular than America's religious institutions.
[01:31:29.322 --> 01:31:30.263]  All of them.
[01:31:30.263 --> 01:31:33.166]  It's more popular than the media, the Congress, and big business.
[01:31:33.806 --> 01:31:39.632]  Black Matters is more popular by double digits than both the Democratic and the Republican parties.
[01:31:39.632 --> 01:31:41.414]  It's almost as popular as the U.S.
[01:31:41.414 --> 01:31:42.255]  military.
[01:31:42.255 --> 01:31:45.238]  It's much more popular than the Pope.
[01:31:45.238 --> 01:31:49.522]  The numbers are astounding, but the polls are not the only measure of it.
[01:31:49.522 --> 01:31:52.505]  Here's a Black Lives Matter rally from over the weekend in New York.
[01:31:53.305 --> 01:31:54.887]  Look at that picture.
[01:31:54.887 --> 01:31:57.411]  That is an ocean of people.
[01:31:57.411 --> 01:32:01.838]  Ask yourself the last time you saw a candidate for office who was able to draw a crowd like that.
[01:32:01.838 --> 01:32:08.748]  The media, in their relentlessly fawning coverage, usually describe Black Lives Matter as an activist group or a protest movement.
[01:32:09.369 --> 01:32:11.231]  But that's deception by understatement.
[01:32:11.231 --> 01:32:14.334]  Black Lives Matter is not a collection of marchers with signs.
[01:32:14.334 --> 01:32:18.197]  It's not a conventional political lobby like Planned Parenthood or the NRA.
[01:32:18.197 --> 01:32:21.841]  It's not pressuring Congress to pass some narrow new set of laws.
[01:32:21.841 --> 01:32:24.943]  Black Lives Matter is far more ambitious than that.
[01:32:24.943 --> 01:32:28.467]  It is working to remake the country and then to control it.
[01:32:28.467 --> 01:32:30.128]  It's a political party.
[01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:34.692]  As of tonight, Black Lives Matter may be the single most powerful political party in the United States.
[01:32:35.413 --> 01:32:38.896]  Nobody says that out loud, but politicians understand it perfectly well.
[01:32:38.896 --> 01:32:41.018]  If nothing else, they understand power.
[01:32:41.018 --> 01:32:42.980]  They can smell it at great distances.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:47.224]  And that's why they're lining up to bow before Black Lives Matter.
[01:32:47.224 --> 01:32:53.950]  You can't really reform a department that is rotten to the root.
[01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:56.773]  We've heard our people cry out, I can't breathe.
[01:32:59.534 --> 01:33:01.176]  We've heard our people speak out.
[01:33:01.176 --> 01:33:04.561]  Black lives matter.
[01:33:04.561 --> 01:33:09.126]  This is a systemic problem that requires a comprehensive solution.
[01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:13.112]  What I would say is that there is a legitimacy to this anger.
[01:33:13.112 --> 01:33:14.754]  There's a legitimacy to this outrage.
[01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:19.252]  None of what you just saw is a stretch for Democrats.
[01:33:19.252 --> 01:33:23.294]  They believe their long-term goals align with those of Black Lives Matter.
[01:33:23.294 --> 01:33:26.757]  And in fact, at times, the group functions as an arm of the Democratic Party.
[01:33:26.757 --> 01:33:30.779]  More telling, though, and more ominous, is the response from many Republicans.
[01:33:30.779 --> 01:33:36.623]  They've been happy to go along as well, where in Mitt Romney's case, even mouthed the same slogans.
[01:33:36.623 --> 01:33:42.507]  A way to end violence and brutality, and to make sure that people understand that Black Lives Matter.
[01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:47.493]  That was the former Republican nominee for president.
[01:33:47.493 --> 01:33:48.955]  Let that sink in.
[01:33:48.955 --> 01:33:54.080]  If there was ever an indicator of how powerful Black Lives Matter has become, you just saw it.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:00.427]  Republican leaders brag about their strong conservative convictions, but mostly they just want to be on the winning team, whatever that is.
[01:34:00.427 --> 01:34:02.629]  That's why they pause before offending China.
[01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:05.752]  It's why when Black Lives Matter tells them to take a knee, they do.
[01:34:06.903 --> 01:34:09.005]  It's all pretty strange when you think about it.
[01:34:09.005 --> 01:34:18.473]  If the leaders of Black Lives Matter are political actors, and they are, then by definition you are allowed to have any opinion you want to have about them.
[01:34:18.473 --> 01:34:23.457]  Black Lives Matter wants to run the country, therefore you can freely criticize Black Lives Matter.
[01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:25.319]  Those are the rules of our system.
[01:34:25.319 --> 01:34:26.840]  But not anymore.
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:32.104]  Imagine a world where you are punished for questioning the behavior of the president or for insulting your local mayor.
[01:34:32.785 --> 01:34:34.127]  You probably can't imagine that.
[01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:35.469]  It's too bizarre.
[01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:36.651]  It's un-American.
[01:34:36.651 --> 01:34:38.213]  But that's where we are right now.
[01:34:38.213 --> 01:34:40.296]  Black Lives Matter has changed the rules.
[01:34:40.296 --> 01:34:42.359]  And here's their first new rule.
[01:34:42.359 --> 01:34:44.702]  No criticizing Black Lives Matter.
[01:34:44.702 --> 01:34:47.587]  You can be fired from your job if you disobey.
[01:34:47.587 --> 01:34:48.688]  Many Americans have been.
[01:34:49.449 --> 01:34:56.992]  On Friday, for example, the principal of a public school in Windsor, Vermont was dismissed from her job for posting the following words on her personal Facebook page, quote,
[01:35:08.576 --> 01:35:09.677]  End quote.
[01:35:09.677 --> 01:35:11.998]  Unfortunately, the principal's boss disagreed.
[01:35:11.998 --> 01:35:17.922]  The superintendent of Windsor schools described the quote you just heard as quote, outright racist.
[01:35:17.922 --> 01:35:19.483]  Windsor, Vermont, by the way, is more than 97% white.
[01:35:21.525 --> 01:35:30.207]  Also on Friday, an economist called Harold Eulig lost his job at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for daring to offer even milder criticism than that.
[01:35:30.207 --> 01:35:38.149]  On Twitter, Eulig noted that Black Lives Matter had, quote, just torpedoed itself with its full-fledged support of hashtag defund the police.
[01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:46.111]  Now is the time, Eulig noted, quote, for sensible adults to enter back into the room and have serious, earnest, respectful conversations about it all.
[01:36:00.622 --> 01:36:02.704]  2020 has been a wild ride.
[01:36:02.704 --> 01:36:18.258]  From a global pandemic to riots sweeping the nation, and now we have seen in live time the creation of a brand new autonomous zone within America's own borders, called CHAZ or CHOP for short, which stands for the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone or the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest.
[01:36:19.741 --> 01:36:22.863]  But what is this new area and what does it stand for?
[01:36:22.863 --> 01:36:37.353]  This autonomous zone was taken by Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters in response to the anti-police movement sweeping America, with protesters taking over six blocks of downtown Seattle, including the East Precinct of the Seattle Police Department.
[01:36:37.353 --> 01:36:46.099]  Protesters then overtook the police department, ultimately pushing them out of the area, declaring it a cop-free zone and naming it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.
[01:36:51.789 --> 01:36:55.870]  The citizens share that this is an autonomous territory outside of the U.S.
[01:36:55.870 --> 01:37:04.132]  and have attempted to create their own socialist utopia, complete with free food, clothes, a farm, and most importantly, no police.
[01:37:04.132 --> 01:37:07.373]  But what is life like inside of this zone, and how has this week-long experience played out?
[01:37:07.373 --> 01:37:11.575]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the full report from Savannah Hernandez can be found at band.video.
[01:37:11.575 --> 01:37:19.817]  When we come back, we'll go live to our crew from the Democrat-run craphole in Seattle.
[01:37:22.148 --> 01:37:24.752]  The United States is not Communist China.
[01:37:24.752 --> 01:37:27.676]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[01:37:27.676 --> 01:37:29.579]  We don't blow up churches.
[01:37:29.579 --> 01:37:32.743]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[01:37:32.743 --> 01:37:38.031]  But all over the news, we see the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, mainstream
[01:37:40.657 --> 01:37:40.977]  I think so.
[01:38:03.314 --> 01:38:03.734]  I don't know.
[01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:24.711]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[01:38:24.711 --> 01:38:26.272]  The first of its kind.
[01:38:26.272 --> 01:38:31.255]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[01:38:31.255 --> 01:38:34.257]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[01:38:34.257 --> 01:38:37.359]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[01:38:37.359 --> 01:38:40.460]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.962]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[01:38:43.502 --> 01:38:45.703]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[01:38:45.703 --> 01:38:47.723]  It's great to keep with you.
[01:38:47.723 --> 01:38:54.065]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[01:38:54.065 --> 01:38:55.706]  We're really excited about it.
[01:38:55.706 --> 01:38:57.706]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[01:38:57.706 --> 01:39:09.190]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:20.061]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at infowarestore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[01:39:22.096 --> 01:39:24.538]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[01:39:24.538 --> 01:39:27.479]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[01:39:27.479 --> 01:39:28.540]  It's the highest quality.
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:29.961]  They've got it.
[01:39:29.961 --> 01:39:36.385]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[01:39:36.385 --> 01:39:38.907]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[01:39:38.907 --> 01:39:41.828]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[01:39:41.828 --> 01:39:47.092]  80% is offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globalists.
[01:39:47.092 --> 01:39:50.414]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[01:39:51.647 --> 01:39:54.408]  We're going to still go down the hard road now.
[01:39:54.408 --> 01:40:00.329]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[01:40:00.329 --> 01:40:01.830]  You need to get high quality storable food.
[01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:03.030]  It's something you need.
[01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:14.033]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360 wins, so please take care of your storable foods needs at InfoWarstore.com and get your orders in now so you get it, so you have it.
[01:40:14.033 --> 01:40:16.834]  It's in great containers, high quality, last 25 years.
[01:40:16.834 --> 01:40:20.835]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:40:22.677 --> 01:40:24.439]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[01:40:24.439 --> 01:40:24.879]  You're on the air.
[01:40:24.879 --> 01:40:26.520]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.161]  I sure can, sir.
[01:40:27.161 --> 01:40:28.142]  Thank you.
[01:40:28.142 --> 01:40:31.325]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:40:38.471 --> 01:40:58.916]  I just want to plug in I'm a truck driver and two before us have changed the way I drive me and me and my my brothers that drive a couple of us we are Hispanics Cubans Puerto Ricans we used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I start drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[01:40:58.936 --> 01:40:59.737]  Thank you for that, man.
[01:40:59.737 --> 01:41:05.381]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:07.683]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[01:41:07.683 --> 01:41:10.145]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[01:41:10.145 --> 01:41:12.827]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[01:41:12.827 --> 01:41:16.850]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:18.651]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[01:41:18.651 --> 01:41:19.392]  So that means a lot to me.
[01:41:19.392 --> 01:41:19.732]  Thank you.
[01:41:19.732 --> 01:41:24.896]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[01:41:24.896 --> 01:41:27.518]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:45.976 --> 01:41:48.259]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:41:48.259 --> 01:41:51.584]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:51.584 --> 01:41:55.029]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:41:55.029 --> 01:42:01.658]  Alright, it's 1047 local in the nation of Chazistan, Choppistan.
[01:42:03.715 --> 01:42:06.877]  As it's 1247 here Central Time in Austin, Texas.
[01:42:06.877 --> 01:42:09.658]  So it's apparently bright and early.
[01:42:09.658 --> 01:42:20.424]  This is still a bright and early morning at 1047 as the people of Chaz are just starting to wrestle themselves out of their tents and sewer holes.
[01:42:20.424 --> 01:42:24.506]  We're joined by Rob, who is out there, boots on the ground.
[01:42:24.506 --> 01:42:27.688]  Another night in Chaz Chop Nation of Chaz.
[01:42:30.249 --> 01:42:31.671]  Uh, what, uh, what is it like now?
[01:42:31.671 --> 01:42:33.593]  You've been there for three or four nights.
[01:42:33.593 --> 01:42:34.994]  You're out there on the ball field.
[01:42:34.994 --> 01:42:38.397]  It's, uh, it's totally empty though.
[01:42:38.397 --> 01:42:42.481]  Yeah, man, we've been here for about, uh, I don't know, about three or four days, somewhere around there.
[01:42:42.481 --> 01:42:43.182]  Three days, maybe.
[01:42:43.646 --> 01:42:44.566]  You know, it's Chaz, man.
[01:42:44.566 --> 01:42:45.907]  They don't even have clocks out here.
[01:42:45.907 --> 01:42:48.907]  You know, we ain't worried about time.
[01:42:48.907 --> 01:42:50.388]  Clocks are illegal in Chaz.
[01:42:50.388 --> 01:42:51.148]  It's like Neverland.
[01:42:51.148 --> 01:42:52.408]  It is, man.
[01:42:52.408 --> 01:42:56.909]  Yeah, it's funny we bring up clocks because you know how Flavor Flav wears that big ol' clock?
[01:42:56.909 --> 01:43:01.191]  Well, actually, we have white folks out here wearing art.
[01:43:01.191 --> 01:43:02.791]  It's art with a fist on there.
[01:43:02.791 --> 01:43:06.912]  And it's like a necklace, but it's a piece of art that hangs there on that high.
[01:43:06.912 --> 01:43:09.633]  And that's the new claim to fame out here.
[01:43:10.723 --> 01:43:11.984]  As art necklaces.
[01:43:11.984 --> 01:43:12.545]  I don't know.
[01:43:12.545 --> 01:43:13.786]  It's weird, man.
[01:43:13.786 --> 01:43:15.607]  But the vibe is definitely different.
[01:43:15.607 --> 01:43:18.850]  Yeah, is this just the eternal way of life now?
[01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:19.570]  Yeah, dude.
[01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.392]  It's just, you go with the flow, man.
[01:43:21.392 --> 01:43:24.514]  You know.
[01:43:24.514 --> 01:43:28.958]  Hold on, there seems to be some construction happening behind you.
[01:43:28.958 --> 01:43:31.320]  Did somebody hijack a forklift or what is that?
[01:43:32.782 --> 01:43:38.504]  No, dude, they're actually, I think they're kind of shrinking the autonomous zone.
[01:43:38.504 --> 01:43:51.427]  They're having some kind of issues with the actual business owners and homeowners out here that they're starting to kind of come to some kind of agreement that they need to get to work, they need to get to, you know, they need to work and they need to get in and out of their garages.
[01:43:51.427 --> 01:43:56.889]  A lot of the garages are being blocked because of the autonomous zone being out in front of their entryways.
[01:43:57.569 --> 01:44:22.146]  So they're kind of bringing that back a little bit and I want to say they're probably scaling this down to maybe a four block radius and they're adding right now they're adding uh cement blocks so I think that they're starting to make more of the long-term plans as as far as you know the first couple days out here it was really a tourist scene man and a lot of people didn't want to be interviewed and I could see why because they they didn't know how to describe this they were in their home city and this was
[01:44:22.706 --> 01:44:26.049]  Like, they were sad that people were excited that this was going on.
[01:44:26.049 --> 01:44:31.154]  And a lot of them, I got a lady off camera and she was just devastated, man.
[01:44:31.154 --> 01:44:38.641]  A lot of these people out here who don't understand the other lives are actually impacting because they want to make this political statement.
[01:44:38.641 --> 01:44:44.446]  A lot of them say it's justified because of the racial, the systematic racism in this country.
[01:44:45.607 --> 01:44:48.529]  Which, by the way, as a black American, I have never felt oppressed.
[01:44:48.529 --> 01:44:55.553]  I have never felt, you know, like I haven't been able to achieve anything else anybody else has hasn't achieved.
[01:44:55.553 --> 01:44:56.113]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:44:56.113 --> 01:45:00.676]  That's, that, that, saying something like that, that's hate speech in jazz.
[01:45:00.676 --> 01:45:07.119]  That's why I'm kind of in the middle of the field today and not over by the precinct, man, because I'm tired of kind of holding my tongue out here.
[01:45:07.119 --> 01:45:11.382]  There's so many people who are brainwashed and it's, it's, it's starting to affect me, man.
[01:45:11.382 --> 01:45:11.782]  I don't,
[01:45:13.188 --> 01:45:28.295]  In Austin, you know, it's not as bad as out here, but when you're in here for a couple of days and you see the mental issues a lot of these people have that aren't getting addressed, you see, like, this gentleman over here is one of the guys who actually yelled at the guy who was walking around in the Trump flag yesterday.
[01:45:29.075 --> 01:45:35.518]  And he was calling the other guy suicidal and deranged and while he was foaming at the mouth saying he was suicidal and deranged.
[01:45:35.518 --> 01:45:45.182]  Yeah, when that guy, all that guy did, you guys have the footage, it's a banned out video, he was just walking around, he wasn't even saying much, if anything at all, just holding an American flag.
[01:45:45.182 --> 01:45:50.904]  Yeah, he didn't, and that was one of the arguments he made before he left, and to tell you the truth,
[01:45:51.508 --> 01:45:58.753]  If we didn't have these cameras as close as we did, and we weren't there the entire time, this guy might have not made it out of here.
[01:45:58.753 --> 01:46:03.176]  When he got to the end, he was getting into an altercation with one of the black guys.
[01:46:03.176 --> 01:46:10.601]  Well, one of the black guys he was getting into an altercation from is one of the people that we have on video sitting at the couch with guns.
[01:46:10.601 --> 01:46:12.502]  So, he almost made it out.
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:20.188]  And until that kind of altercation came, and he actually, earlier in the situation, he actually had to pay somebody.
[01:46:20.188 --> 01:46:23.051]  Like, he pretty much, like, our headline was not lying.
[01:46:23.051 --> 01:46:25.434]  He did get robbed just to leave out of here alive.
[01:46:25.434 --> 01:46:29.899]  It's like paying off the mafia to quit harassing you or whatever.
[01:46:30.799 --> 01:46:33.441]  Yeah, if you don't believe in their ideology, definitely.
[01:46:33.441 --> 01:46:34.122]  Definitely, man.
[01:46:34.122 --> 01:46:36.144]  And we were lucky to get a tour.
[01:46:36.144 --> 01:46:37.846]  You know how InfoWars is.
[01:46:37.846 --> 01:46:39.127]  We're here for the people.
[01:46:39.127 --> 01:46:48.135]  So when we explained to them, like, this is why we're so close, because they're gonna... ABC back there, who's listening and complying, is gonna chop this up, and they're gonna look like the bad guy.
[01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:50.037]  I was like, we have to be here for a reason.
[01:46:50.037 --> 01:46:53.460]  And after that, they kind of understood, and they kind of, like, backed off on us.
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:56.623]  But there's still those people who are here to create chaos.
[01:46:57.003 --> 01:46:58.705]  And those are the people who are driving him out.
[01:46:58.705 --> 01:47:00.406]  Those are the people who are ripping his flag.
[01:47:00.406 --> 01:47:09.995]  Those are the people who, uh, like there was people here who understood this little, this, this black lady was like, as a black lady, he's, I don't believe why he's here, but I believe he has a right to be here.
[01:47:09.995 --> 01:47:15.060]  And she explained that it wasn't a black person who ripped that flag out of that guy's, uh, off that guy's flagpole.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:18.483]  And dude, they stole his hat twice, but they did return his hat.
[01:47:18.483 --> 01:47:19.664]  They stole his flag twice.
[01:47:20.117 --> 01:47:25.020]  And I returned it twice, but he had to pay for his freedom to get out of here.
[01:47:33.035 --> 01:47:37.138]  And they really may be in their belief, but they don't understand how they're a pawn of the establishment.
[01:47:37.138 --> 01:47:47.725]  I mean, when you're talking to these people, I guess, that ask you about InfoWars, or when you bring that up, I mean, do they understand, like, InfoWars is the epitome of anti-establishment?
[01:47:47.725 --> 01:47:52.228]  Like, there is no head, tip of the spear against the establishment like InfoWars.
[01:47:52.228 --> 01:47:54.850]  Even if they don't like some of our politics, do they understand that?
[01:47:55.993 --> 01:47:57.134]  No, they don't, man.
[01:47:57.134 --> 01:48:00.837]  It's literally, it's still one side of the other out here.
[01:48:00.837 --> 01:48:07.402]  There's not really, the conversation that they, the little conversation they do have, it's one, it's one-sided.
[01:48:07.402 --> 01:48:12.025]  It's either one, I mean, it's, it's, it tells, you know, it's the same side of the, two sides of the same coin.
[01:48:12.936 --> 01:48:34.650]  And yesterday I will admit they did have two like circle rallies kind of where they actually spoke about you know their their feelings and how what kind of change should be should come about and we have one clip of one guy who was actually able to speak the truth literally the same stuff that we would say but he was black so he was able to say it to them and they were able to applause but
[01:48:35.091 --> 01:48:42.834]  As far as all the partying, I mean, it's more of, right now, over the weekend, over the tourists, the people who came, they, like, right now, they'd be full of drunk people out here.
[01:48:42.834 --> 01:48:48.657]  Right now, as you can see, it's just the people who are actually staying here for a good amount of time.
[01:48:48.657 --> 01:48:51.858]  And those are the people who, they know how the system works.
[01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:54.239]  Nobody will speak on Rastamon.
[01:48:54.239 --> 01:49:00.502]  Like, you might, even in general conversation, not even on camera, you bring it up and they're like, we're not speaking about that, man.
[01:49:01.122 --> 01:49:08.009]  And I got shut down about four times, and when I actually brought up Rasmone, they actually like stopped the whole conversation.
[01:49:08.009 --> 01:49:09.731]  I just changed the subject.
[01:49:09.731 --> 01:49:22.944]  So... You know, and look, I kind of assume this guy organically just decided to take over, but it's getting a little more suspicious with the hush money and the payoffs and then the Tesla and the guns.
[01:49:22.944 --> 01:49:24.025]  That's kind of odd stuff.
[01:49:25.336 --> 01:49:49.288]  And uh yes dude it really really is and what's what's crazy about that is how secretive that little part is but we do have a big kind of break about that because yesterday we were able to talk um we kind of got in with two heads of security yesterday actually three and um two of them one of them gave us a tour and one of them last night he kind of explained the whole Raz situation um along with uh Jack Posobiec
[01:49:50.243 --> 01:49:58.628]  And we have on record of the head of security out here saying that Jack Pasovic is lying and that he's making up these allegations.
[01:49:58.628 --> 01:50:00.489]  They might have some type of video of a tussle.
[01:50:00.489 --> 01:50:03.691]  There was because that guy was, you know, being very disrespectful.
[01:50:03.691 --> 01:50:09.074]  But the whole outlook on Roz has kind of been.
[01:50:09.074 --> 01:50:13.236]  He's he's for the people, but as far as the business section, no one talks about.
[01:50:13.892 --> 01:50:24.698]  So, you know, we do have exclusive audio from the actual head of security out here explaining, you know, the fire situation and the theft situation of Roz.
[01:50:24.698 --> 01:50:33.843]  So that's really as far out as the information we've been able to gather about Roz is that he's for the people, but he's actually, you know, but he's honest.
[01:50:33.843 --> 01:50:35.644]  He's for his own business as well.
[01:50:36.874 --> 01:50:39.597]  Well, look, I'm kind of a Second Amendment purist.
[01:50:39.597 --> 01:50:44.082]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and attack the guy, I guess, for distributing weapons to the people.
[01:50:44.082 --> 01:50:52.050]  I'm not the left that's anti-Second Amendment that's now been totally proven as just another hypocrisy of the left.
[01:50:52.050 --> 01:50:59.318]  But, you know, it's funny because I see the scenes there and I see the scenes behind you and I see some of the scenes and, you know, here's what I don't understand.
[01:51:00.413 --> 01:51:06.536]  If you want to live that life, and you want to be a lazy bum, and live in a situation like this, then you know what?
[01:51:06.536 --> 01:51:06.877]  Fine.
[01:51:06.877 --> 01:51:07.657]  I feel like fine.
[01:51:07.657 --> 01:51:14.020]  You can do that, live in a tent, live in the woods, live in a dilapidated city, live in the sewer, live under a bridge, if that's what you want to do.
[01:51:14.020 --> 01:51:16.562]  I want to have nice things.
[01:51:16.562 --> 01:51:18.463]  Like, you want to have nice things.
[01:51:18.463 --> 01:51:20.624]  Like, we want to live in an advanced civilization.
[01:51:20.624 --> 01:51:23.966]  It's like, they don't even want to allow us that.
[01:51:24.246 --> 01:51:31.088]  They don't even want to allow anyone in America to have an advanced civilization, advanced culture of unity.
[01:51:31.088 --> 01:51:36.430]  It's like they want to live in a crap hole, so they want everyone to live in a crap hole with them.
[01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:41.592]  Yes, man, exactly, and that's the sign up out here because we have one of the altercations.
[01:51:41.592 --> 01:51:42.892]  Yesterday there was a lot of infighting.
[01:51:43.453 --> 01:51:46.234]  Because they are upset.
[01:51:46.234 --> 01:51:56.579]  The people who are here all day are upset that the people who are here in the mornings, they talk about protesting and they talk about don't do drugs and don't do partying, but yet they leave at three o'clock.
[01:51:56.579 --> 01:51:58.380]  So the people who are here are frustrated.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.820]  So they're infighting, they're doing this.
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:00.821]  Let's come back.
[01:52:00.821 --> 01:52:02.041]  We've got a short break here.

[01:52:05.803 --> 01:52:08.284]  I guess they're going to start making like a citizenship thing now.

[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.881]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[01:53:26.881 --> 01:53:35.705]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[01:53:35.965 --> 01:53:42.492]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[01:53:42.492 --> 01:53:44.054]  I can personally feel the difference.
[01:53:44.054 --> 01:53:51.942]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[01:53:52.182 --> 01:53:56.986]  Iodine may also support your body and healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[01:53:56.986 --> 01:54:02.010]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[01:54:02.010 --> 01:54:09.476]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[01:54:09.476 --> 01:54:14.401]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:54:14.401 --> 01:54:17.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:25.410 --> 01:54:27.311]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:54:27.311 --> 01:54:34.153]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:34.153 --> 01:54:37.154]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:54:37.154 --> 01:54:49.258]  You know, I guess the eternal question is, should you care about the Chazz Zone and Roz running Seattle?
[01:54:49.258 --> 01:54:50.058]  Should you care?
[01:54:50.058 --> 01:54:51.879]  If you're not in Seattle, should it bother you?
[01:54:53.324 --> 01:54:58.526]  If you're not in a major Democrat city that may descend into this, should it bother you?
[01:54:58.526 --> 01:55:01.147]  Should we just let this happen?
[01:55:01.147 --> 01:55:03.967]  I think there's a fair debate on both sides.
[01:55:03.967 --> 01:55:08.549]  I think it was also a setup for President Trump that he did not take the bait on.
[01:55:08.549 --> 01:55:13.430]  So, I would at least agree with the non-response there.
[01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:18.132]  I'm more upset with the President for not arresting the treasonous actors, but that's a side issue.
[01:55:18.132 --> 01:55:21.153]  He's letting the left destroy its own cities, and I think that's what they deserve.
[01:55:22.921 --> 01:55:25.002]  Rob, you've broken some news here.
[01:55:25.002 --> 01:55:31.187]  One, the Chazz Chop Zone has actually gotten a little smaller.
[01:55:32.455 --> 01:55:34.156]  I don't see how much longer they can last.
[01:56:00.207 --> 01:56:07.154]  Like I said, yesterday there was a lot of infighting and they called out each other for not being able to shower, not being prepared.
[01:56:07.154 --> 01:56:18.266]  They explained that if, if honestly, like you said, there was, it's a good no response from Trump because if he wasn't coming here and take these people out, like the ones who are still here right now, they're, they're defenseless.
[01:56:18.266 --> 01:56:18.927]  They're helpless.
[01:56:18.927 --> 01:56:20.969]  Like he's going to have to take most of them to the state hospital.
[01:56:21.454 --> 01:56:24.597]  Which I closed.
[01:56:24.597 --> 01:56:26.298]  There is no long run here.
[01:56:26.298 --> 01:56:28.220]  They know that this is not going to last forever.
[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:32.904]  Especially that one of the security guards that I was talking to yesterday, they're like, yeah, we know we're not ready.
[01:56:32.904 --> 01:56:34.846]  Because this might not even last forever.
[01:56:34.846 --> 01:56:36.167]  But we need to get our point across.
[01:56:38.604 --> 01:56:41.605]  I was telling Dario, man, like, Jaco Sobic, he's not allowed in here.
[01:56:41.605 --> 01:56:43.686]  ABC, they're probably not gonna let back in here.
[01:56:43.686 --> 01:56:55.489]  There's a lot of these news organizations who are coming in here and not, you know, are putting gas to their fire and kind of making it worse for them being here because they're making it seem like a war zone.
[01:56:55.489 --> 01:56:59.310]  That's only gonna tempt people to, oh, why isn't Trump doing anything?
[01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:05.752]  Like, if people were to come out here, it's like right now, they'd be like, well, this is a morning of Woodstock.
[01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:07.553]  Like, it's actually just clean.
[01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:08.153]  That's all it is.
[01:57:08.897 --> 01:57:12.099]  So the people are going to get tired of giving donations.
[01:57:12.099 --> 01:57:14.280]  People are going to get tired of helping each other out.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.680]  And like you said, you hit it right on the nail.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:17.881]  They don't want to live in advanced civilization.
[01:57:17.881 --> 01:57:21.543]  So what happens when they're like, damn, I miss kind of laying in my own bed.
[01:57:21.543 --> 01:57:24.985]  I miss laying in my, you know, uh, taking a bath.
[01:57:24.985 --> 01:57:25.945]  Having a shower.
[01:57:25.945 --> 01:57:26.185]  Yeah.
[01:57:26.185 --> 01:57:26.526]  What's this?
[01:57:26.526 --> 01:57:28.446]  They can't even take showers?
[01:57:28.446 --> 01:57:30.547]  No, there's not a shower set up out here at all.
[01:57:30.547 --> 01:57:31.828]  There's a hand washing station.
[01:57:31.828 --> 01:57:33.669]  That's is one hand washing station.
[01:57:34.335 --> 01:57:35.035]  Like, that's it.
[01:57:35.035 --> 01:57:37.397]  They don't really have running water.
[01:57:37.397 --> 01:57:39.518]  It's literally all off of donations.
[01:57:39.518 --> 01:57:43.861]  It's like a third world country who knows kind of how to clean up after each other.
[01:57:43.861 --> 01:57:45.062]  Or themselves.
[01:57:45.062 --> 01:57:48.164]  But the only people who are cleaning are the volunteers.
[01:57:48.164 --> 01:57:51.646]  So, I don't see this lasting long.
[01:57:53.452 --> 01:58:01.997]  We have the average music festival like will go long as like a week, you know people get burned out or whatever I mean, is that kind of like where the energy you're feeling right now?
[01:58:01.997 --> 01:58:02.757]  It's just like okay.
[01:58:02.757 --> 01:58:03.838]  We're kind of getting burned out.
[01:58:03.838 --> 01:58:14.684]  This was fun But there's no there's no where this can really go from here that's so what I feel but these guys are are amped up man and I
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:18.542]  I just, I will say this for sure, man.
[01:58:18.542 --> 01:58:25.146]  I wouldn't be able to be giving you this interview right now, or we weren't being able to stay up as late as we did last night if I didn't have Turbo Force.
[01:58:25.146 --> 01:58:30.229]  Like, Turbo Force is the best thing that we probably have, in my opinion, at the store.
[01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:32.990]  Wait, are you on Turbo Force right now?
[01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.791]  Right now.
[01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:39.415]  Like, that was one of the first things I did before I even brushed my teeth and took a shower.
[01:58:39.415 --> 01:58:40.656]  You know, we have a hotel, guys.
[01:58:40.656 --> 01:58:44.019]  I'm not, like, we stayed here maybe pretty late last night.
[01:58:44.019 --> 01:58:47.903]  I could have stayed the night, but now, you know, we went to take a shower.
[01:58:47.903 --> 01:58:51.506]  But yeah, man, definitely Turbo Force.
[01:58:51.506 --> 01:58:55.350]  I can go for another literally five, six hours without eating, no problem.
[01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:57.652]  Get some energy from eating and keep going.
[01:58:57.652 --> 01:58:59.714]  But it really has died down here, man.
[01:59:00.382 --> 01:59:04.504]  I think that maybe after they wake up and, you know, things get going.
[01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:06.745]  Yesterday around 2 o'clock... Alright, we gotta take a break.
[01:59:06.745 --> 01:59:07.325]  Stay right there.
[01:59:07.325 --> 01:59:08.786]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[01:59:08.786 --> 01:59:14.288]  You've got the TurboForce Energy, so let's keep Rob with us for another segment here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:14.288 --> 01:59:15.309]  Breaking news live.
[01:59:15.309 --> 01:59:17.630]  Boots on the ground from Chop Chaz Nation.
[01:59:20.393 --> 01:59:22.035]  It's finally here.
[01:59:22.035 --> 01:59:26.139]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[02:00:26.673 --> 02:00:30.734]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:00:30.734 --> 02:00:34.956]  Today and now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:42.964 --> 02:00:44.269]  Apparently that's a thing, I don't even know.
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:50.721]  Alright, we got Rob Boots on the ground from Chop Chaz.
[02:00:50.721 --> 02:00:53.062]  Chaz Chop!
[02:00:53.062 --> 02:01:01.904]  You do the Chaz Chop with me?
[02:01:01.904 --> 02:01:05.785]  Maybe that's what the Chop Chaz needs to kind of reunify and re-energize.
[02:01:05.785 --> 02:01:12.706]  Because apparently the movement is starting to die down as the food shortage is and the lack of showering and such.
[02:01:12.706 --> 02:01:14.007]  And people are just getting burnt out.
[02:01:15.208 --> 02:01:19.655]  But let me ask you this question, Rob, as you're live on the boots on the ground there from Chaz Chop.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.524]  The president signed an executive order today on police reform.
[02:01:25.524 --> 02:01:35.752]  Some of the president's most ardent supporters and a lot of conservative commentators are saying that it's not a victory for President Trump, a huge victory for Democrats and for the left, who are not going to vote for him anyway.
[02:01:35.752 --> 02:01:44.639]  But I'm curious, and maybe they're not awake yet, so they may not know about this executive order, but Trump signs an executive order on police reform.
[02:01:44.639 --> 02:01:47.081]  This is right along the lines of what these people want.
[02:01:47.561 --> 02:01:49.103]  Do you think there'll be any give?
[02:01:49.103 --> 02:01:50.465]  Do you think there'll be any praise?
[02:01:50.465 --> 02:01:53.909]  Do you think they'll even hear about this?
[02:01:53.909 --> 02:01:58.734]  Um, they won't hear about it and they won't care because they don't want reform.
[02:01:58.734 --> 02:02:00.857]  They want abolishment.
[02:02:00.857 --> 02:02:05.102]  Um, even like what's crazy is some of the Swedish people we've talked to, man, and they
[02:02:06.286 --> 02:02:09.527]  Cold hearted, I mean warm hearted, like just volunteers.
[02:02:09.527 --> 02:02:11.867]  They're like, so what do you think they should do?
[02:02:11.867 --> 02:02:12.887]  What kind of reform?
[02:02:12.887 --> 02:02:13.868]  Oh, we don't need reform.
[02:02:13.868 --> 02:02:15.368]  They just need to be gone.
[02:02:15.368 --> 02:02:16.328]  They need to be gone.
[02:02:16.328 --> 02:02:22.429]  They need to let these people, and it's funny because they literally say these people, they need to let these people take care of themselves.
[02:02:22.429 --> 02:02:30.031]  And it just shocks me how many people are for abolishing and just total disbandment of the police department.
[02:02:30.786 --> 02:02:32.067]  And it's like, okay, so what do you want?
[02:02:32.067 --> 02:02:33.108]  Like state government?
[02:02:33.108 --> 02:02:34.449]  You want federal government?
[02:02:34.449 --> 02:02:35.510]  They're like, I don't know.
[02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:37.371]  All we need is the local police to be gone.
[02:02:37.371 --> 02:02:37.832]  We don't care.
[02:02:37.832 --> 02:02:41.334]  And it's like, you can tell they only know those talking points.
[02:02:41.334 --> 02:02:48.620]  So honestly, like I said, they don't want this precinct back open as an actual precinct at all.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:50.101]  They want it to be a community center.
[02:02:50.101 --> 02:02:54.024]  So some people say they're not leaving until that's a community center.
[02:02:54.024 --> 02:02:57.627]  And some people are saying, well, we just want some type of changes.
[02:02:58.075 --> 02:03:01.437]  So, the ones who are actually living here, they want abolishment.
[02:03:01.437 --> 02:03:03.038]  They don't want reform.
[02:03:03.038 --> 02:03:06.119]  Have they been able to think down the line with this?
[02:03:06.119 --> 02:03:08.161]  I mean, does that put Ra's in charge?
[02:03:08.161 --> 02:03:09.621]  Or do they get their own guns?
[02:03:09.621 --> 02:03:11.302]  Or is there no law enforcement?
[02:03:11.302 --> 02:03:12.383]  Is it just anarchy?
[02:03:12.383 --> 02:03:15.285]  Or what do they even think about that?
[02:03:15.285 --> 02:03:16.145]  They're mindless, dude.
[02:03:16.145 --> 02:03:16.985]  There is no thinking.
[02:03:16.985 --> 02:03:19.707]  They can't logically think ahead.
[02:03:20.458 --> 02:03:29.184]  That's, like I was telling, I might have told you or Harrison yesterday, but standing in the middle of the crowd during the weekend, you're surrounded by a crowd of zombies.
[02:03:29.184 --> 02:03:32.646]  No one knows where to go, no one knows what they're doing, why they're there.
[02:03:32.646 --> 02:03:35.427]  They're just in the shop, they're like, holy shit, like, holy, excuse me.
[02:03:35.427 --> 02:03:38.449]  But like, it's just... They don't know what they're doing, man.
[02:03:38.449 --> 02:03:39.350]  He's in shop, Chaz.
[02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:41.011]  It's, you know, it's... That's what it is.
[02:03:41.011 --> 02:03:42.412]  They got a little mouthy over there.
[02:03:42.412 --> 02:03:44.994]  It's a new language they're developing.
[02:03:44.994 --> 02:03:47.055]  We forgive your Chaz action, it's okay.
[02:03:48.863 --> 02:03:50.387]  You were speaking chop for a second.
[02:03:50.387 --> 02:03:52.571]  We get it.
[02:03:52.571 --> 02:03:54.435]  But it's just how many people are mindless, man.
[02:03:54.435 --> 02:03:56.520]  It's getting frustrating.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:58.243]  Well, here's what I don't understand.
[02:03:59.848 --> 02:04:01.409]  And this is just basic common sense.
[02:04:01.409 --> 02:04:13.217]  It's like, if we're just, like, if Rob and I are, say, you know, just hanging out after work or, you know, having a drink at a bar or something, we're just having, just having a conversation, it's like, we don't even get, like, modern common sense in conversation anymore.
[02:04:13.217 --> 02:04:15.979]  It's like, okay, well, there are some issues with police and stuff.
[02:04:15.979 --> 02:04:16.960]  We could reform some stuff.
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.601]  I'd be down to reform some stuff.
[02:04:18.601 --> 02:04:25.585]  I'd say, uh, all non-violent criminals that are currently in jail, you know, should be released.
[02:04:25.585 --> 02:04:28.147]  Non-violent criminals should not be behind bars.
[02:04:28.147 --> 02:04:29.288]  Okay, there's some reform.
[02:04:29.868 --> 02:04:32.789]  That would help, I think, and would appease some people.
[02:04:32.789 --> 02:04:34.370]  Okay, let's end the war on drugs.
[02:04:34.370 --> 02:04:40.272]  Let's get police stopped from pulling us over for not having a seatbelt or being on our cell phone or some other such nonsense.
[02:04:40.272 --> 02:04:45.773]  Let's just stop giving police these tiny tic-tac reasons to get involved in our lives and bother us.
[02:04:45.773 --> 02:04:48.334]  Hey, that's reform I think everybody could get behind.
[02:04:48.334 --> 02:04:53.636]  But no, now we just attack the police and now we open it up for the left to get even more violent.
[02:04:55.307 --> 02:05:02.095]  Yes man, and what do you think these criminals that they let go because of coronavirus are gonna go?
[02:05:02.095 --> 02:05:04.577]  Oh, to the land where there's no laws?
[02:05:04.577 --> 02:05:10.284]  I mean, what happens when these places start popping up all over the United States and they call in these protests?
[02:05:10.284 --> 02:05:13.207]  Like, what happens if they take over Congress and, um...
[02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:15.013]  You know, in 35.
[02:05:15.013 --> 02:05:17.735]  What happens when they shut down the highway for the autonomous zone?
[02:05:17.735 --> 02:05:20.057]  And then we have just illegals.
[02:05:20.057 --> 02:05:23.800]  Uh, we have, uh, all these felons, like they're all living in this crazy area.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:24.481]  Like you're right, dude.
[02:05:24.481 --> 02:05:25.742]  It's just going to be anarchy.
[02:05:25.742 --> 02:05:27.504]  And they, they, they don't see that.
[02:05:27.504 --> 02:05:29.145]  And what you're talking about reform right now.
[02:05:29.145 --> 02:05:31.027]  I just, I just saw some police reform right now.
[02:05:31.027 --> 02:05:35.530]  This guy literally stole a whole thing of donuts from one of the places.
[02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:37.052]  And they were, they started chasing them.
[02:05:37.052 --> 02:05:38.172]  They're like, no, don't chase them.
[02:05:38.172 --> 02:05:39.454]  He's not well.
[02:05:39.454 --> 02:05:39.894]  And it's like,
[02:05:40.621 --> 02:05:44.383]  So you can steal as long as you say you're not well.
[02:05:44.383 --> 02:05:49.146]  Oh boy, that gives the Liberals carte blanche to steal everything, which they're already doing.
[02:05:49.146 --> 02:05:51.367]  Exactly, man.
[02:05:51.367 --> 02:05:59.372]  We tracked down that business that supposedly got looted, and the guy was like, nah, the windows were already broken.
[02:05:59.372 --> 02:06:01.053]  And I was like, do you want to tell a story?
[02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:01.913]  But there's no story.
[02:06:01.913 --> 02:06:03.634]  They did this a couple of days ago.
[02:06:03.634 --> 02:06:04.514]  It's like, okay.
[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:11.467]  It's just, so many people are so misunderstanding the whole situation over here, like it's a war zone.
[02:06:11.467 --> 02:06:14.231]  But at the same time, they are letting these people do whatever they want.
[02:06:15.249 --> 02:06:20.570]  They say they have medics and doctors who are official who are just undercover.
[02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:24.271]  And it's like, man, so many mentally ill people are out here.
[02:06:24.271 --> 02:06:25.631]  There's no doctors out here, man.
[02:06:25.631 --> 02:06:28.272]  Yeah, that's not a recipe for disaster.
[02:06:28.272 --> 02:06:29.452]  Oh yeah, I'm a doctor.
[02:06:29.452 --> 02:06:30.652]  Here, come have some surgery.
[02:06:30.652 --> 02:06:32.773]  Yeah, you never see your liver again.
[02:06:32.773 --> 02:06:38.594]  What about, there were rumors that bikers for Trump or some other Trump groups were headed up or into the zone.
[02:06:38.594 --> 02:06:39.774]  Have you seen or heard any of that?
[02:06:41.081 --> 02:06:52.267]  No man, I did have some people reach out and say that one said that they weren't coming and then another said that they're planning a 4th of July cleanup celebration over here.
[02:06:52.267 --> 02:07:01.432]  So they're saying if this is still going on around the 4th of July that they are going to come up here and they're going to peacefully clean up the trash that has been occupying the space.
[02:07:03.323 --> 02:07:10.585]  That's going to be an interesting event come July 4th, but as of right now, there's really no action.
[02:07:10.585 --> 02:07:16.866]  Yesterday, Patriot Prayer showed up and they didn't really hassle them too much.
[02:07:16.866 --> 02:07:25.588]  We also got a breakdown of why that other pastor who was assaulted, his name was actually Matthew.
[02:07:25.588 --> 02:07:31.489]  We met his friend and that guy is mentally ill and he was running around putting his speaker inside people's ears.
[02:07:32.008 --> 02:07:40.670]  That's why they were trying to take a speaker from him and the people who were beating him up or supposedly beat him up were his own people because he was going around and trying to hurt other people.
[02:07:40.670 --> 02:07:46.312]  Well, explain this because I'm glad that you broke this story because a lot of people wouldn't have heard that.
[02:07:46.312 --> 02:07:53.253]  I mean, because it sounds to me like they're pretty much rejecting most, if not all, media.
[02:07:53.253 --> 02:07:59.375]  So how do they expect the truth to get out when they're not letting media in and stories can easily be distorted or twisted?
[02:08:00.710 --> 02:08:02.890]  That's exactly what we broke down to them.
[02:08:02.890 --> 02:08:06.031]  And when we said that to them, it was just like an eye-opening event, dude.
[02:08:06.031 --> 02:08:07.751]  They were like, Oh, you know what?
[02:08:07.751 --> 02:08:08.571]  Yeah, let him boot.
[02:08:08.571 --> 02:08:09.051]  Let him through.
[02:08:09.051 --> 02:08:10.072]  Let him through.
[02:08:10.072 --> 02:08:20.713]  So when you're genuine with these people, when you actually have a conversation and they see that you're not here out to like, make them look bad, then it's kind of a whole different outlook.
[02:08:20.713 --> 02:08:25.634]  But, you know, CBS and ABC who were out here, you know, they're out here for their money shots.
[02:08:25.634 --> 02:08:29.615]  So they're trying to get in and the security that they do have here, you know, they bumped heads with them.
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:41.626]  And they got to the point to where the CBS cameraman bodyguard, he threatened to sue somebody because they touched his, they touched his cameraman.
[02:08:42.131 --> 02:08:44.792]  And the guy that he said that to, he just laughed.
[02:08:44.792 --> 02:08:46.172]  He stopped and he looked at him, he laughed.
[02:08:46.172 --> 02:08:48.453]  He goes, where are the cops going to come for you, bro?
[02:08:48.453 --> 02:08:55.374]  And that cameraman and the bodyguard had this like, oh, you know, like, oh yeah, there's no cops coming.
[02:08:55.374 --> 02:08:58.415]  He's like, yeah, so you better listen or you're going to get knocked out.
[02:08:58.415 --> 02:08:59.955]  And they backed up and they were off.
[02:08:59.955 --> 02:09:06.717]  So it's like, if you're not really accepted in this community, they will treat you, you know, as you saw with the guy with the Trump flag.
[02:09:07.278 --> 02:09:13.059]  You know, they didn't treat him too nice, so if they don't like you out here, they definitely will make you get out.
[02:09:13.059 --> 02:09:21.721]  Well, I would say that, you know, Chop Chazistan is the epitome of what the left wants for every city in America, and so it's kind of a test run.
[02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:28.722]  And so we'll give him the test run and we'll see how successful or how lack of successful it is.
[02:09:28.722 --> 02:09:30.963]  Alright, Rob, anything else you want to report before we let you go?
[02:09:33.064 --> 02:09:33.864]  Uh, not much, man.
[02:09:33.864 --> 02:09:36.125]  We're gonna be here all day and all night.
[02:09:36.125 --> 02:09:39.307]  And, uh, we'll be checking, you know, at the Daily Chazz.
[02:09:39.307 --> 02:09:45.789]  We'll be giving you daily updates, videos, and pictures of, uh, the day, of the days, you know, of course, and what's going on out here.
[02:09:45.789 --> 02:09:50.211]  So, uh, we'll bring you all the news we can out here as long as we are out here.
[02:09:50.211 --> 02:09:50.751]  All right.
[02:09:50.751 --> 02:09:52.152]  The people of CHOP have spoken.
[02:09:53.615 --> 02:09:57.397]  He's kind of got like a HBV-1 CHOP visa.
[02:09:57.397 --> 02:09:58.317]  It's unofficial.
[02:09:58.317 --> 02:10:01.518]  Rob has the HBV-1 CHOP visa.
[02:10:01.518 --> 02:10:10.482]  He's allowed to work there for another couple days, and then they're going to have to renew his application process so that he's allowed to stay in the CHOP, Shazestan country.
[02:10:10.482 --> 02:10:16.365]  All right, when we come back, I'm going to open up the phone lines and cover some of this news and take your calls.
[02:10:16.365 --> 02:10:16.805]  We'll be right back.
[02:10:23.965 --> 02:10:32.159]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:35.741]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[02:10:35.741 --> 02:10:39.124]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[02:10:39.124 --> 02:10:45.388]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[02:10:45.388 --> 02:10:51.192]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[02:10:51.192 --> 02:10:53.673]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[02:10:53.673 --> 02:10:54.494]  That's why now
[02:10:55.134 --> 02:11:05.117]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation, they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[02:11:05.117 --> 02:11:09.278]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[02:11:09.278 --> 02:11:13.519]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[02:11:13.519 --> 02:11:16.520]  InfoWars.com lives!
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:28.069]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[02:11:28.069 --> 02:11:31.933]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[02:11:31.933 --> 02:11:38.539]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[02:11:39.259 --> 02:11:44.662]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[02:11:44.662 --> 02:11:47.243]  You must decide which side you're on.
[02:11:47.243 --> 02:11:56.188]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[02:11:56.188 --> 02:12:00.751]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[02:12:00.751 --> 02:12:02.292]  The delusions must end now.
[02:12:03.252 --> 02:12:08.655]  InfoWars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[02:12:08.655 --> 02:12:12.596]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[02:12:12.596 --> 02:12:13.937]  They are truly fools.
[02:12:13.937 --> 02:12:21.461]  We must fight this, or lose our souls.
[02:12:21.461 --> 02:12:24.062]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:36.687 --> 02:12:39.928]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:12:39.928 --> 02:12:44.729]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:12:44.729 --> 02:12:50.711]  Alright, I said I'd take your call, so I'm going to open up the phone lines, but we're really only going to have one segment to do it, but we'll just do that anyway.
[02:12:50.711 --> 02:12:55.992]  And then Alex Jones is going to be coming back before Paul Joseph Watson takes over in the fourth hour.
[02:12:55.992 --> 02:12:57.632]  So the phone number to call if you want to get in, 877-789-2539.
[02:12:57.632 --> 02:12:57.752]  877-789-2539.
[02:12:57.752 --> 02:12:58.372]  In the meantime,
[02:13:05.362 --> 02:13:08.784]  I will do some news coverage here.
[02:13:08.784 --> 02:13:13.566]  New York Police Department disbands plainclothes units involved in many shootings.
[02:13:13.566 --> 02:13:15.547]  Well, that's a misnomer.
[02:13:15.547 --> 02:13:31.195]  What they did was they disbanded the anti-crime units, which were actually the most responsible for gun arrests, for illegal guns and criminals that had guns that weren't supposed to.
[02:13:31.195 --> 02:13:33.776]  So, I'm sure that'll go really well for New York.
[02:13:35.424 --> 02:13:40.167]  Federal execution set to resume after nearly two-decade hiatus.
[02:13:40.167 --> 02:13:44.010]  Did John Brennan just crap his britches?
[02:13:44.010 --> 02:13:48.713]  Next LGBTQ rights legal battle looms after Supreme Court victory.
[02:13:48.713 --> 02:13:50.475]  Oh!
[02:13:50.475 --> 02:13:52.076]  This is such a joke.
[02:13:52.076 --> 02:13:54.037]  In fact, I think I'm going to go all the way.
[02:13:54.037 --> 02:13:58.680]  Would this be considered extreme right-wingism or extreme left-wingism?
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:04.004]  I now declare I think that it should be legal for you to discriminate in your place of business.
[02:14:04.004 --> 02:14:04.465]  Why not?
[02:14:05.458 --> 02:14:11.149]  Hell, you can discriminate against a conservative or a whitey, why not just say you can discriminate against everybody?
[02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.590]  So now...
[02:14:14.356 --> 02:14:17.558]  Everybody has minority or special protections.
[02:14:17.558 --> 02:14:21.901]  And based on that ideology, I can literally just claim I'm a woman right now.
[02:14:21.901 --> 02:14:25.444]  But they won't allow that because they realize how ridiculous it is.
[02:14:25.444 --> 02:14:33.550]  But it's nice that the Supreme Court is now up here, you know, talking about sex again and talking about wee-wees and pee-pees while the country is being burned to the ground.
[02:14:33.550 --> 02:14:35.331]  Real good job, Supreme Court.
[02:14:35.331 --> 02:14:37.993]  You guys are just right on the money.
[02:14:39.025 --> 02:14:39.746]  Yeah.
[02:14:39.746 --> 02:14:43.089]  Let's talk about gay sex at the Supreme Court.
[02:14:43.089 --> 02:14:44.129]  Alright.
[02:14:44.129 --> 02:14:45.090]  That'll be the big issue.
[02:14:45.090 --> 02:14:48.833]  Let's protect, let's protect people that chop their wieners off.
[02:14:48.833 --> 02:14:49.734]  Yeah.
[02:14:49.734 --> 02:14:52.957]  Can't discriminate against them.
[02:14:52.957 --> 02:14:53.758]  What a joke.
[02:14:54.770 --> 02:14:55.010]  U.S.
[02:14:55.010 --> 02:14:58.914]  casinos push for cashless gambling payments, citing virus.
[02:14:58.914 --> 02:15:00.496]  There you go, Cashless Society.
[02:15:00.496 --> 02:15:08.203]  Now, if you remember, I gave you, it was like the phase 10 or 9 phase plan or whatever it was, for the New World Order, and that was one of them, the Cashless Society.
[02:15:08.203 --> 02:15:09.945]  Now they're, go ahead and enrolling it out.
[02:15:12.305 --> 02:15:13.366]  FDA releases this.
[02:15:13.366 --> 02:15:14.446]  Coronavirus update.
[02:15:14.446 --> 02:15:18.787]  FDA revokes emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
[02:15:18.787 --> 02:15:20.528]  Another misnomer.
[02:15:20.528 --> 02:15:23.189]  It was never meant as a reactive measure.
[02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:24.649]  It was a preventative measure.
[02:15:24.649 --> 02:15:26.469]  So they're lying about it again.
[02:15:26.469 --> 02:15:27.490]  These people are sick, man.
[02:15:27.490 --> 02:15:30.511]  The FDA, I guess they just want you to die.
[02:15:30.511 --> 02:15:32.171]  I guess that's just how that goes.
[02:15:32.171 --> 02:15:33.312]  Yeah.
[02:15:33.312 --> 02:15:35.212]  Yeah.
[02:15:35.212 --> 02:15:37.473]  Just wear your mask and get hypoxia too.
[02:15:37.473 --> 02:15:37.893]  It's all good.
[02:15:39.252 --> 02:15:59.387]  Oh, did you see Malik Obama, the brother of Barack Obama, tweeted out a birth certificate and claimed that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, which would of course make him an illegitimate president, and therefore everything he did illegitimate, and thus proving the left to be the dumbest people in American history.
[02:15:59.387 --> 02:16:02.889]  But we'll see if any of that pans out.
[02:16:02.889 --> 02:16:03.570]  Buck Sexton.
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:09.303]  Says, how long do you think it will be before someone gets cancelled for wearing a t-shirt that says Fox News?
[02:16:09.303 --> 02:16:18.627]  Now, this is all because Mike Gundy, who is an outspoken football coach at Oklahoma State, which is one of the most conservative states in the union, had an OAN shirt on.
[02:16:18.627 --> 02:16:20.048]  Like, oh wow, it's so bad.
[02:16:20.048 --> 02:16:29.293]  But, you know, here's this, this whole notion, like somehow Fox News is beyond reproach, but if you're OAN or InfoWars or something else on the fringe, like, yeah, you wear that t-shirt, you deserve it.
[02:16:29.293 --> 02:16:30.714]  But don't come after Fox!
[02:16:30.714 --> 02:16:32.055]  No, not us!
[02:16:32.055 --> 02:16:32.615]  We're above it!
[02:16:34.002 --> 02:16:37.125]  That notion is BS.
[02:16:37.125 --> 02:16:43.190]  That's the totalitarianism of Fox to control the conservative movement, folks.
[02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:47.854]  And again, it was Buck Sexton complaining that there's no mothership for conservatives where you can't get banned.
[02:16:47.854 --> 02:16:50.836]  I guess you've never heard of InfoWars or Banned.Video.
[02:16:50.836 --> 02:16:52.638]  Queen Latifah!
[02:16:52.638 --> 02:16:55.981]  Let gone with the wind be gone with the wind!
[02:16:55.981 --> 02:16:59.824]  So they're banning gone with the wind, folks.
[02:16:59.824 --> 02:17:01.065]  Do you know what this is really about?
[02:17:04.704 --> 02:17:08.385]  This isn't about racism.
[02:17:08.385 --> 02:17:09.686]  Have you seen Gone With The Wind?
[02:17:09.686 --> 02:17:20.750]  Now, it's been a while since I've seen it, but you understand that Gone With The Wind, the quote-unquote racism in Gone With The Wind, you realize that's the Democrat Party.
[02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:27.592]  It literally tells the story about the KKK converting to Democrats and their racism.
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:40.890]  So, the reason why Google is rewriting history, claiming that Democrat and Dixiecrats are Republicans, the reason why they're getting rid of HBO, gone with the wind, is because they don't want you to know the truth about the Democrats.
[02:17:40.890 --> 02:17:42.971]  The Democrats were the party of the KKK.
[02:17:42.971 --> 02:17:47.535]  In fact, I'm now almost convinced that Biden is the head of the KKK.
[02:17:47.535 --> 02:17:50.217]  I'm not even joking.
[02:17:50.217 --> 02:17:54.220]  I think the Democrats are still, to this day, running KKK operations.
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:55.942]  I'm not even kidding you.
[02:17:55.942 --> 02:17:57.063]  And Biden may be the leader.
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:20.751]  Folks, you can go look up, when the Republicans launched their platform, after freeing the slaves, the Democrats put out propaganda for their candidates, or for their politics, literally on the pamphlets it was attacking black people.
[02:18:20.751 --> 02:18:22.972]  Calling them the N-word, depicting them as clowns.
[02:18:22.972 --> 02:18:23.733]  Yeah, there it is right there!
[02:18:25.503 --> 02:18:26.945]  That's the damn Democrats!
[02:18:26.945 --> 02:18:30.710]  They're erasing that history, folks!
[02:18:30.710 --> 02:18:41.004]  Google and the establishment are erasing the Democrat history of their racism, of slavery, of the KKK!
[02:18:41.004 --> 02:18:42.647]  Joe Biden is the leader of the KKK!
[02:18:45.424 --> 02:18:48.907]  Charles Barkley warns of slippery slope when it comes to NFL kneeling.
[02:18:48.907 --> 02:18:51.148]  I'm done with the NFL.
[02:18:51.148 --> 02:18:52.990]  Sad to say, I've been a big NFL fan.
[02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:55.872]  I love watching football, especially on Sundays.
[02:18:55.872 --> 02:18:58.294]  They won't get another dime from me.
[02:18:58.294 --> 02:19:00.055]  I will never go to an NFL game.
[02:19:00.055 --> 02:19:03.698]  They won't get another minute of my time if they ever do kick off their season.
[02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:06.784]  Done with all these leagues.
[02:19:06.784 --> 02:19:08.904]  Done with the NBA.
[02:19:08.904 --> 02:19:14.846]  Now I haven't gotten any BS from the NHL or the MLB as far as some virtue signaling leftist BS.
[02:19:14.846 --> 02:19:18.667]  But the moment I do, I'm done with them as well.
[02:19:18.667 --> 02:19:22.049]  I'm done with anybody who's promoting propaganda in my face.
[02:19:22.049 --> 02:19:24.069]  Done.
[02:19:24.069 --> 02:19:26.390]  Mayor Adler puts this out today here in Austin.
[02:19:26.390 --> 02:19:30.231]  Wearing face coverings in public helps prevent the spread of COVID-19.
[02:19:30.231 --> 02:19:31.832]  You can kiss my ass.
[02:19:33.203 --> 02:19:36.365]  This simple action makes a big difference in our community.
[02:19:36.365 --> 02:19:39.147]  Help each other, wear your masks, shut the hell up!
[02:19:39.147 --> 02:19:43.351]  I'm not wearing a damn mask.
[02:19:43.351 --> 02:20:02.065]  Oh, oh, by the way, Mayor Adler and the City of Austin are now not only funding Planned Parenthood and giving them free rent on a building that would be millions annually, now your taxpayer dollars are going to transportation for people to get an abortion.
[02:20:02.065 --> 02:20:02.305]  Wow.
[02:20:03.407 --> 02:20:04.808]  Put your tax dollars here in Austin.
[02:20:04.808 --> 02:20:05.749]  Don't stop there.
[02:20:05.749 --> 02:20:10.953]  They've now painted Black Austin Matters on Congress Avenue.
[02:20:10.953 --> 02:20:16.578]  We're being ripped off and stolen and robbed from seven ways to Sunday by the Democrats, folks.
[02:20:16.578 --> 02:20:19.160]  Makes me sick.
[02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:21.041]  Tessa Majors.
[02:20:21.041 --> 02:20:21.822]  Remember her?
[02:20:21.822 --> 02:20:22.563]  No, probably not.
[02:20:22.563 --> 02:20:26.486]  Just a white girl who was murdered in the park by black men because she was white.
[02:20:26.486 --> 02:20:28.628]  Nobody heard about her.
[02:20:28.628 --> 02:20:31.190]  So that sentencing is going down right now.
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:32.620]  Oh, how about this?
[02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:37.183]  New York police finds no criminality after officers sickened at Shake Shack.
[02:20:37.183 --> 02:20:38.763]  Appears to be accidental.
[02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:40.444]  Ha!
[02:20:40.444 --> 02:20:42.265]  It appears to be accidental!
[02:20:42.265 --> 02:20:53.390]  Oh, the only three customers that got sick all day long at Shake Shack happened to be three police officers that had bleach in their shakes, but... Oh, that's just a coincidence!
[02:20:53.390 --> 02:20:59.533]  They didn't intentionally try to poison those officers, even though Shake Shack put out BLM propaganda just days before.
[02:20:59.533 --> 02:21:00.234]  No, no, no, no, no!
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:04.361]  Folks, you understand, the left is literally getting away with everything.
[02:21:04.361 --> 02:21:06.162]  Next will be murder.
[02:21:06.162 --> 02:21:07.363]  You think that's a joke?
[02:21:07.363 --> 02:21:09.083]  You think that sounds crazy?
[02:21:09.083 --> 02:21:10.504]  They've gone this far.
[02:21:10.504 --> 02:21:14.606]  The left will get away with murder next if we don't stop them now.
[02:21:14.606 --> 02:21:15.486]  This is attempted murder.
[02:21:15.486 --> 02:21:17.807]  They tried to murder police.
[02:21:17.807 --> 02:21:26.011]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:21:27.287 --> 02:21:32.030]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:34.372]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:21:34.372 --> 02:21:43.238]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:21:43.238 --> 02:21:54.086]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:21:54.386 --> 02:21:55.067]  Yes.
[02:21:55.067 --> 02:21:59.970]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:21:59.970 --> 02:22:06.675]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:22:06.675 --> 02:22:07.956]  What are you waiting for?
[02:22:07.956 --> 02:22:09.818]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:22:09.818 --> 02:22:12.620]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:16.122]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:22:17.403 --> 02:22:19.844]  I was talking to my Patriots supplier, Great Suppliers.
[02:22:19.844 --> 02:22:25.285]  You can now say, four weeks on average for storable food, it's the highest quality, they've got it.
[02:22:25.285 --> 02:22:31.667]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[02:22:31.667 --> 02:22:34.208]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[02:22:34.208 --> 02:22:37.129]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[02:22:37.129 --> 02:22:40.510]  80% is offense, but I've always been 100% offense.
[02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:42.391]  Trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[02:22:42.391 --> 02:22:45.732]  I mean, giving them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[02:22:46.957 --> 02:22:49.738]  We are going to still go down the hard road now.
[02:22:49.738 --> 02:22:55.620]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still going to be bad in my view.
[02:22:55.620 --> 02:22:57.140]  You need to get high quality storable food.
[02:22:57.140 --> 02:22:58.341]  It's something you need.
[02:22:58.341 --> 02:23:09.365]  We have high quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast and 360Win, so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarrestore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[02:23:09.365 --> 02:23:12.146]  It's in great containers, high quality, lasts 25 years.
[02:23:12.146 --> 02:23:16.147]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.

[02:23:49.754 --> 02:23:51.077]  Mmmmm.

[02:24:11.263 --> 02:24:19.950]  Our original Mega Flash specials have ended, but our new GE specials have launched at InfoWarsStore.com!
[02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:22.612]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:36.857 --> 02:24:41.159]  Black lives matter or just some black lives?
[02:24:41.159 --> 02:24:45.260]  The black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:46.841]  Yes?
[02:24:46.841 --> 02:24:50.743]  The black babies killed in the abortion clinics matter, right?
[02:24:50.743 --> 02:24:51.923]  Thought so.
[02:24:51.923 --> 02:24:57.946]  The black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[02:24:57.946 --> 02:24:58.606]  Okay.
[02:24:58.606 --> 02:25:02.648]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter, do they?
[02:25:02.648 --> 02:25:04.708]  Medical people.
[02:25:04.708 --> 02:25:05.709]  Do their lives matter?
[02:25:07.011 --> 02:25:10.213]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[02:25:10.213 --> 02:25:11.033]  Huh?
[02:25:11.033 --> 02:25:11.914]  What's up?
[02:25:11.914 --> 02:25:12.374]  What's up?
[02:25:12.374 --> 02:25:13.775]  Awful quiet now, aren't they?
[02:25:13.775 --> 02:25:15.736]  Uh-huh.
[02:25:15.736 --> 02:25:19.619]  It's okay if we kill them in the womb, right?
[02:25:19.619 --> 02:25:24.902]  But you have a problem when we, you don't seem to really have a problem when we kill them on the streets.
[02:25:24.902 --> 02:25:27.243]  Yes, well we know they're the same issue.
[02:25:27.243 --> 02:25:36.409]  If we don't, if we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them, our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:39.531]  And there's the ultimate truth right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:39.531 --> 02:25:41.891]  And it just shows you how brainwashed the masses are.
[02:25:41.891 --> 02:25:45.172]  You say Black Lives Matter, they're all, ah, woo-wee!
[02:25:45.172 --> 02:25:48.453]  And then he's like, yeah, what about the black men killing black men, like in Chicago?
[02:25:48.453 --> 02:25:49.013]  Silent.
[02:25:49.013 --> 02:25:50.734]  What about the black babies that are aborted?
[02:25:50.734 --> 02:25:51.134]  Silent.
[02:25:51.134 --> 02:25:52.834]  What about the black police that got murdered?
[02:25:52.834 --> 02:25:53.595]  Silent.
[02:25:53.595 --> 02:25:55.535]  These people don't care about black lives.
[02:25:55.535 --> 02:26:04.458]  They care about just the destruction of America and whatever front fraud group that they can use to bring that down on us.
[02:26:04.458 --> 02:26:05.858]  We're gonna go to your phone calls real quick.
[02:26:08.014 --> 02:26:10.437]  I'm just sickened at what I'm seeing.
[02:26:10.437 --> 02:26:12.379]  And the President said we get sick of winning.
[02:26:12.379 --> 02:26:17.003]  Do you realize that people who are defending themselves right now from these leftist mobs are all being arrested?
[02:26:17.003 --> 02:26:19.986]  Do you realize that?
[02:26:19.986 --> 02:26:21.207]  Makes me sick.
[02:26:21.207 --> 02:26:24.691]  Including a man who was attacked for defending a statue.
[02:26:24.691 --> 02:26:26.192]  He shot one individual.
[02:26:26.192 --> 02:26:27.894]  He was violently attacked, but now he's the criminal.
[02:26:30.073 --> 02:26:31.714]  That's been happening nationwide.
[02:26:31.714 --> 02:26:35.656]  Harvard professor, defunding police is not a solution, could cost thousands of black lives.
[02:26:35.656 --> 02:26:37.818]  Doesn't matter, Black Lives Matter doesn't care about black lives.
[02:26:37.818 --> 02:26:40.560]  It's a front group to destroy America.
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:50.086]  Activist who said white racists are the enemy at a protest, leaves the protest and is then molested and murdered by a black man.
[02:26:50.086 --> 02:26:53.729]  Woke mobs destroying statues of anti-slavery figures.
[02:26:55.095 --> 02:26:58.317]  There's also some conflict happening around the world.
[02:26:58.317 --> 02:27:01.499]  India and China at the border there.
[02:27:01.499 --> 02:27:07.063]  North Africa as well, and France, and Seoul, and North Korea.
[02:27:07.063 --> 02:27:11.465]  There's something that was exploded over there, so it's just crazy.
[02:27:11.465 --> 02:27:12.546]  Protests everywhere.
[02:27:12.546 --> 02:27:14.247]  This is globalism, folks.
[02:27:14.247 --> 02:27:19.110]  Alright, let's go to the callers and go to Ken in South Carolina.
[02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:21.732]  Go ahead, Ken.
[02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:22.192]  Hey, Owen.
[02:27:22.192 --> 02:27:23.152]  Great to be with you.
[02:27:23.152 --> 02:27:23.673]  Thanks for calling.
[02:27:24.642 --> 02:27:26.683]  I want to address the shooting in Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:27:26.683 --> 02:27:29.265]  I believe Rayshard, I don't even remember his last name off hand.
[02:27:29.265 --> 02:27:33.267]  Yeah, the guy that abused women and beat a child.
[02:27:33.267 --> 02:27:33.968]  Oh no, no.
[02:27:33.968 --> 02:27:38.310]  He's an innocent bystander, shot dead as he fled from cops.
[02:27:38.310 --> 02:27:40.752]  Oh yeah, the guy that fought police and shot him with a taser.
[02:27:41.735 --> 02:27:44.596]  Well, I don't know if he landed that punch, but doggone it, he was pretty good.
[02:27:44.596 --> 02:27:48.478]  And the one cop tried a jiu-jitsu move, but didn't know how to execute a rear naked choke.
[02:27:48.478 --> 02:27:50.359]  But that's my point.
[02:27:50.359 --> 02:27:52.900]  I see a systematic problem on both sides of the coin.
[02:27:52.900 --> 02:27:56.942]  Now, personally, I've worn a badge and a gun in a very short time, and most of my arrests were drunk.
[02:27:56.942 --> 02:28:08.308]  So, I fault the two police officers, even though they were respectful and nice, before they were going to arrest him, they should have made sure that he knew he couldn't escape, and they should have both had one arm ready to cuff, and the cuff should have been hidden behind their back.
[02:28:08.308 --> 02:28:09.148]  That's what you do.
[02:28:09.148 --> 02:28:10.829]  Because nine out of ten drunks
[02:28:11.505 --> 02:28:14.526]  They're out of their mind and they're gonna run or they're gonna wrestle with you.
[02:28:14.526 --> 02:28:18.088]  So they were the worst calls we ever had and that's mostly what I had to arrest.
[02:28:18.088 --> 02:28:22.570]  300 arrests, never had to draw my gun on those arrests and no problem.
[02:28:22.570 --> 02:28:25.131]  But here's the thing, let me count the felonies.
[02:28:25.131 --> 02:28:28.452]  Oh, and he committed no less than four felonies that night.
[02:28:28.452 --> 02:28:36.776]  And people have to realize that we have empowered police with the privilege of shooting a fleeing felon in order to stop their escape.
[02:28:37.316 --> 02:28:37.997]  You know the law.
[02:28:37.997 --> 02:28:42.101]  You can't, you and I can't shoot a fleeing felon because we don't have a badge right now.
[02:28:42.101 --> 02:28:46.945]  So if someone commits a felony and breaks contact and runs, we have to give chase, but we cannot shoot them.
[02:28:46.945 --> 02:28:51.910]  But we give the special privilege of shooting felonies in order to stop an escaping felon.
[02:28:53.012 --> 02:28:53.914]  To the police.
[02:28:53.914 --> 02:28:56.378]  That is a special privilege that they're given.
[02:28:56.378 --> 02:29:01.526]  So you cannot let people think, I don't care if they're white, black, brown, whatever.
[02:29:01.526 --> 02:29:07.576]  You can't brace a man or slap a man or punch a man with a gun, let alone commit the felony of disarming a police officer.
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:15.865]  Assaulting, felonious assault on a police officer, felonious resisting arrest, and obviously felony DUI.
[02:29:15.865 --> 02:29:17.727]  And then not expect something to happen.
[02:29:17.727 --> 02:29:19.408]  The shoot is righteous, whether we like it or not.
[02:29:19.408 --> 02:29:22.730]  Now personally, I wouldn't have shot the guy, but I'm Monday morning quarterbacking it.
[02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:33.858]  My thing is, if I have his wallet already, he can run all he wants to, I've got him on drunkenness, he can't get his car, so I'm gonna let him go, and we're gonna go get four felonies against him and send the Sheriff's Department to go pick him up nice and peaceably when he's sober.
[02:29:34.758 --> 02:29:35.998]  And I would agree with that.
[02:29:35.998 --> 02:29:37.199]  That officer was within his right.
[02:29:37.199 --> 02:29:40.980]  It was within his authority to do it, whether we like it or not.
[02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:47.302]  And that's just the use of deadly force written into law, which nobody seems to be talking about.
[02:29:47.302 --> 02:29:49.723]  But again, why do they sit here?
[02:29:49.723 --> 02:29:57.885]  If the media is going to make an event every time a black guy is shot by a white guy or a police officer, then this country is never going to stop having riots and protests, folks.
[02:29:57.885 --> 02:30:00.026]  And it looks like that's the media agenda.
[02:30:00.026 --> 02:30:02.427]  And if they prop up Floyd as a martyr,
[02:30:02.927 --> 02:30:03.567]  Yo, what's up, man?
[02:30:03.567 --> 02:30:06.330]  I just want to say, it's like, over here in Dallas, I don't think we have a lot of
[02:30:33.243 --> 02:30:36.044]  Like, I think we haven't had a lot of out-of-state influence.
[02:30:36.044 --> 02:30:42.827]  So I've been watching, like, the protests trying to get violent, like, in California and New York.
[02:30:42.827 --> 02:30:45.468]  I just say, man, like, what do we do down here?
[02:30:45.468 --> 02:30:52.890]  Because I feel like you get a lot of people, a lot of people are just asleep, really, down over here in Dallas, man.
[02:30:52.890 --> 02:30:54.731]  So, I mean, what do states like that do?
[02:30:55.660 --> 02:31:00.544]  Well, I mean, like I said, if you're in this area, I would just suggest moving out.
[02:31:00.544 --> 02:31:01.966]  I mean, I don't know what else to tell you, man.
[02:31:01.966 --> 02:31:08.471]  The Democrats are going to let these people burn your city to the ground, and they're not going to let you open up a business or do anything because of COVID.
[02:31:08.471 --> 02:31:12.575]  So that's just the Democrat operating system right now.
[02:31:18.275 --> 02:31:19.836]  I mean, I don't know what to tell you, Ken.
[02:31:19.836 --> 02:31:22.157]  I mean, you can't defend yourself, you get arrested.
[02:31:22.157 --> 02:31:23.858]  You can't have your gun out, you get arrested.
[02:31:23.858 --> 02:31:29.920]  I mean, literally, people who are just defending themselves from these violent mobs are getting arrested.
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:31.041]  It's awful.
[02:31:31.041 --> 02:31:36.483]  I saw another picture of, they were claiming they were Proud Boys.
[02:31:36.483 --> 02:31:37.803]  I haven't proven that.
[02:31:37.803 --> 02:31:45.947]  It could just be a fake news report, but it was guys who were armed trying to protect the business from mob riots over the weekend, and all three of them got arrested.
[02:31:46.980 --> 02:31:47.841]  And then what happens?
[02:31:47.841 --> 02:31:51.546]  The mob and rioting continues to happen after you arrest the good guys.
[02:31:51.546 --> 02:31:53.208]  It's sick!
[02:31:53.208 --> 02:31:57.514]  And so again, what motivation does a cop have now to do his job?
[02:31:57.514 --> 02:32:00.939]  What motivation does a citizen have now to defend himself?
[02:32:01.960 --> 02:32:04.362]  We've got to get away from these Democrat hellholes, sadly.
[02:32:04.362 --> 02:32:08.244]  That's, sadly, I don't know what else to say, Ken.
[02:32:08.244 --> 02:32:18.710]  The Democrats have turned their cities into complete hellholes and crapholes of no law, no justice, no order, just total chaos and death and rape.
[02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:20.331]  And that's everything the left is.
[02:32:20.331 --> 02:32:21.552]  Let's take one more call.
[02:32:21.552 --> 02:32:22.813]  Ryan in Oklahoma.
[02:32:22.813 --> 02:32:25.054]  Go ahead, Ryan.
[02:32:25.054 --> 02:32:27.196]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:32:27.196 --> 02:32:29.897]  I just wanted, I know that Noam Chomsky's name is mud.
[02:32:31.678 --> 02:32:40.326]  In all these circles, in the conservative circles, but back in 1988, him and Edward Herman wrote a book called Manufacturing Consent.
[02:32:40.326 --> 02:32:42.988]  And that's what's going on right now.
[02:32:42.988 --> 02:32:44.770]  That's exactly what's going on right now.
[02:32:44.770 --> 02:32:53.998]  The media is manufacturing consent to the public through quieting your voices and Alex's voices.
[02:32:55.070 --> 02:32:57.732]  And not allowing for there to be choice in the media.
[02:32:57.732 --> 02:33:03.095]  Oh yeah, and then showing George Floyd for three straight weeks, exactly.
[02:33:03.095 --> 02:33:15.523]  So, I wish that people would go and take a look at that, check out the five filters of editorial bias, and I would really like for Alex Jones, I'd love to know his take on it, because this is fundamental info war.
[02:33:15.523 --> 02:33:17.924]  Well, and you know, that's kind of the craziest thing about this, Ryan.
[02:33:17.924 --> 02:33:18.885]  Thank you for the call.
[02:33:18.885 --> 02:33:19.966]  And I mentioned that yesterday.
[02:33:19.966 --> 02:33:23.108]  It's like, we have to, I mean,
[02:33:25.759 --> 02:33:29.281]  It's like you said, everything that's happening, it's like we've already predicted all this.
[02:33:29.281 --> 02:33:30.662]  We've already showed you the blueprint.
[02:33:30.662 --> 02:33:32.283]  We already told you all this was going to happen.
[02:33:32.283 --> 02:33:38.086]  So it's like, there's no point in us being redundant saying, hey, we told you, hey, this is how it's going.
[02:33:38.086 --> 02:33:41.308]  It's like now we have to have the plan of action, what to do.
[02:33:42.188 --> 02:33:44.329]  And I don't want to call for a violent offensive front.
[02:33:44.329 --> 02:33:46.810]  I don't think we have to go there yet.
[02:33:46.810 --> 02:33:52.072]  Maybe inevitable, but I mean, right now, if you can, get out of Democrat-run cities.
[02:33:52.072 --> 02:33:53.273]  Get out of inner cities.
[02:33:53.273 --> 02:33:55.914]  I mean, I'm serious, folks.
[02:33:55.914 --> 02:33:59.556]  You need to get as far away from progressive liberals and Democrats as possible.
[02:33:59.556 --> 02:34:04.958]  They are a direct threat to your life, your liberty, your pursuit of happiness, everything.
[02:34:04.958 --> 02:34:06.559]  These are dangerous people.
[02:34:06.559 --> 02:34:08.440]  They're mentally disturbed.
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:08.860]  They're being...
[02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:11.921]  Fumed and fueled by the media.
[02:34:11.921 --> 02:34:17.125]  It's a very dangerous powder keg that the Democrats and the media are lighting off.
[02:34:17.125 --> 02:34:18.886]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:34:18.886 --> 02:34:19.366]  You're on the air.
[02:34:19.366 --> 02:34:20.967]  Thanks for calling.
[02:34:20.967 --> 02:34:21.607]  I sure can, sir.
[02:34:21.607 --> 02:34:21.968]  Thank you.
[02:34:21.968 --> 02:34:24.709]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:34:32.934 --> 02:34:34.375]  I just want to plug in.
[02:34:34.375 --> 02:34:38.798]  I'm a truck driver and 2x4s have changed the way I drive.
[02:34:38.798 --> 02:34:45.442]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[02:34:45.442 --> 02:34:53.387]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[02:34:53.467 --> 02:34:54.188]  Thank you for that, man.
[02:34:54.188 --> 02:34:59.854]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:34:59.854 --> 02:35:02.136]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:35:02.136 --> 02:35:04.598]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[02:35:04.598 --> 02:35:07.281]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:35:07.281 --> 02:35:11.305]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[02:35:11.305 --> 02:35:13.107]  And you're saying that it's made your life better.
[02:35:13.107 --> 02:35:13.848]  So that means a lot to me.
[02:35:13.848 --> 02:35:14.188]  Thank you.
[02:35:14.188 --> 02:35:15.610]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[02:35:16.110 --> 02:35:20.132]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[02:35:20.132 --> 02:35:21.713]  The first of its kind.
[02:35:21.713 --> 02:35:26.676]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[02:35:26.676 --> 02:35:29.697]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[02:35:29.697 --> 02:35:32.779]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[02:35:32.779 --> 02:35:35.900]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:38.502]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[02:35:38.502 --> 02:35:38.582]  It's
[02:35:38.942 --> 02:35:41.164]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car.
[02:35:41.164 --> 02:35:43.166]  It's great to keep with you.
[02:35:43.166 --> 02:35:49.452]  And, again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[02:35:49.452 --> 02:35:51.253]  We're really excited about it.
[02:35:51.253 --> 02:35:53.155]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[02:35:53.155 --> 02:36:04.646]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new and, in some ways, even better way.
[02:36:05.086 --> 02:36:15.507]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself!
[02:36:17.196 --> 02:36:25.503]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[02:36:25.503 --> 02:36:36.432]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[02:36:37.193 --> 02:36:45.639]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[02:36:45.639 --> 02:36:52.244]  He must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[02:36:52.244 --> 02:36:53.565]  The police have a lot of problems.
[02:36:53.565 --> 02:36:54.926]  We all have a lot of problems.
[02:36:54.926 --> 02:36:57.688]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[02:36:57.688 --> 02:36:59.770]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[02:37:00.609 --> 02:37:04.631]  They are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[02:37:04.631 --> 02:37:08.392]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[02:37:08.392 --> 02:37:10.573]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[02:37:10.573 --> 02:37:15.035]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[02:37:15.035 --> 02:37:19.037]  InfoWars.com.
[02:37:19.037 --> 02:37:22.418]  What are champions made of?

[02:38:28.465 --> 02:38:42.661]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, you are about to hear from Alex Jones and then Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:38:43.542 --> 02:38:44.763]  We'll be taking over.
[02:38:44.763 --> 02:38:49.366]  Remember, InfoWarsStore.com, ladies and gentlemen, that's how all this is possible.
[02:38:49.366 --> 02:38:57.492]  Our reporters on the ground in Seattle, all the live shows that we have here from David Knight to Alex Jones to the War Room that I'm normally hosting.
[02:38:57.492 --> 02:39:02.616]  Guest host today, Savannah Hernandez, to Bandop Video, to all the things we do, folks.
[02:39:02.616 --> 02:39:06.658]  It's all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com, so remember that.
[02:39:06.658 --> 02:39:09.761]  And remember, folks, the emergency food, still in stock.
[02:39:10.501 --> 02:39:19.344]  The Democrats and the Deep State and the Globalists are going to launch another big devastating event against this country, and there's going to be a rush on storable food.
[02:39:19.344 --> 02:39:20.824]  There is zero doubt about that.
[02:39:20.824 --> 02:39:29.067]  So get in your orders for emergency storable food at InfoWarsStore.com before another rush happens.
[02:39:29.067 --> 02:39:38.290]  Whether it's a second fake pandemic, a real one, riots and looting all around the United States, get prepared with emergency storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:39:38.290 --> 02:39:39.450]  Now, here, Alex Jones.
[02:39:44.625 --> 02:39:55.532]  The megacorporations that are establishing planetary world government want to destroy the model of open free societies because it competes with their centralized model.
[02:39:55.532 --> 02:39:59.194]  They never wanted to merge the planet and create a kumbaya system.
[02:39:59.194 --> 02:40:06.198]  They actually plan to use the three planetary regions with ten sub-regions to further balkanize
[02:40:07.239 --> 02:40:15.104]  What was left of the once great nation-states by exacerbating ethnic, religious, and historical fissures.
[02:40:15.104 --> 02:40:28.973]  They talk about, when they finally complete this, having armored citadels that are sovereign states, corporate states above the law, similar to what the Vatican is, or the City of London, financial center within London.
[02:40:28.973 --> 02:40:32.375]  There they will be high-tech reservations.
[02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:34.851]  We're good to go.
[02:40:50.066 --> 02:40:57.108]  Through the IMF and World Bank and all these scams they're running on record to vertically integrate things as a form of war.
[02:40:57.108 --> 02:41:09.772]  They're not just greedily establishing this because they want all of the quote resources so that they personally are richer or have a higher number of digits in the bank account.
[02:41:09.772 --> 02:41:14.234]  It's done so they can economically dictate your total surrender.
[02:41:15.174 --> 02:41:20.182]  They are erasing the social contract of the Renaissance that made us fat, dumb, and happy.
[02:41:20.182 --> 02:41:31.017]  They've decided under Social Darwinism that we don't deserve all of this because we've become fat, dumb, and happy, so they're just going to grease the skids for us to slide over the edge into oblivion.
[02:41:31.698 --> 02:41:35.542]  You can look it all up for yourself.
[02:41:35.542 --> 02:41:38.865]  My film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, lays it out.
[02:41:38.865 --> 02:41:44.630]  We've made hundreds and hundreds of other special reports and articles showing their own quotes and their own statements.
[02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:50.335]  That's how I was able, 20 plus years ago, to lay out what the future would look like.
[02:41:50.335 --> 02:41:50.795]  Because...
[02:41:51.957 --> 02:41:59.399]  I was reading you their own white papers and their own economic theories and their own stated goals.
[02:41:59.399 --> 02:42:02.080]  Well, now they've brought us to where they said they would 20 years ago.
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:07.202]  And if they bring us the next few legs, there aren't going to be many people left.
[02:42:07.202 --> 02:42:08.422]  And that's what the lockdowns are for.
[02:42:08.422 --> 02:42:11.984]  They're training you to behave yourself and see nothing happen.
[02:42:11.984 --> 02:42:13.704]  It wasn't a big deal.
[02:42:13.704 --> 02:42:18.686]  And then progressively more deadly real bio weapons are released.
[02:42:19.844 --> 02:42:23.407]  But you behave and sit in your home and die.
[02:42:23.407 --> 02:42:24.428]  And it's not just going to be bio attacks.
[02:42:24.428 --> 02:42:26.730]  It's going to be electrochemical.
[02:42:26.730 --> 02:42:28.892]  It's going to be electromagnetic.
[02:42:28.892 --> 02:42:31.574]  It's going to be chemical.
[02:42:31.574 --> 02:42:34.256]  It's going to be radiological.
[02:42:34.256 --> 02:42:36.618]  And they'll have these overlapping fields of fire.
[02:42:36.618 --> 02:42:40.121]  They will then introduce new diseases, new treatment regimes through the UN.
[02:42:41.738 --> 02:42:52.140]  They have nothing to do with what you're actually getting sick from because it'll actually be a binary or even more than two different things that are combined to create what they've actually hit you with.
[02:42:52.140 --> 02:43:00.021]  And then also, they will also have a treatment regimen, just like with HIV or COVID-19, that actually exacerbates it or makes it worse or actually kills you.
[02:43:00.021 --> 02:43:09.983]  And of course it was Fauci, very evil eugenicist, who oversaw the HIV bioweapon rollout response and the AZT and all the big drugs that actually killed people
[02:43:11.178 --> 02:43:15.020]  Not the HIV virus and of course all of that came out as well.
[02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:37.630]  They know what they're doing and they can be defeated though because psychotics and their servant sociopaths are very OCD and follow the same patterns over and over again and also like to codify their battle plans in very thinly veiled reports and drills and tabletop exercises and then real world exercises.
[02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:39.411]  And that's what Gates has said, Bill Gates, is that
[02:43:40.410 --> 02:43:42.892]  This is Event 201.
[02:43:42.892 --> 02:43:44.233]  This is really just a drill.
[02:43:44.233 --> 02:43:50.937]  He said that on Colbert, not even veiled, a few months ago, but that the bigger ones are coming.
[02:43:50.937 --> 02:43:55.581]  And of course, they'll be the savior there and dictate to us how we live and how we behave.
[02:43:55.581 --> 02:44:03.907]  You know, as for Black Lives Matter, it doesn't matter if it's 12, 14 black men that questionably get killed by the cops every year in the United States.
[02:44:03.907 --> 02:44:06.728]  It doesn't matter if that's one of the rarest forms of death for black men.
[02:44:07.609 --> 02:44:22.865]  The left knows that under what's left of America's Christian ethos that we like to be guilty and so the new religion is hating ourselves and prostrating ourselves and showing that we're bad and saying, you know, just agree that black lives matter.
[02:44:22.865 --> 02:44:24.006]  What you're really agreeing to is
[02:44:25.270 --> 02:44:30.112]  Planned Parenthood and George Soros that fund Black Lives Matter, they're actually carrying out the extermination of black people.
[02:44:30.112 --> 02:44:32.773]  It's the perfect, obscene cover.
[02:44:32.773 --> 02:44:39.056]  Meanwhile, the Clintons oversaw the Rwandan massacre where over a million African Christians were killed.
[02:44:39.056 --> 02:44:44.719]  And the UN didn't just oversee it, it turned out they actually directed and did most of the massacring themselves.
[02:44:45.419 --> 02:44:49.782]  As they were bringing in other African tribes that were anti-Christian and could be controlled by the United Nations.
[02:44:49.782 --> 02:44:55.726]  They were destroying one of the only stable governments in Africa that black Christians had set up.
[02:44:55.726 --> 02:44:58.028]  Because that's the name of the game, destabilization, destruction.
[02:44:58.028 --> 02:45:06.393]  But oh, when I just talk about 800,000 to a million and a half, the numbers vary, of dead black people, that's just, oh come on Jones, you're a white supremacist.
[02:45:06.393 --> 02:45:08.555]  That's the middle programming.
[02:45:08.555 --> 02:45:12.457]  They won't go show you the videos and photos of you and troops raping children or burning over fires.
[02:45:12.457 --> 02:45:14.859]  I mean, I made a film exposing America's robot design.
[02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:19.042]  But see, Google doesn't let you see it, so it's banned.
[02:45:19.042 --> 02:45:22.025]  Just like Tim Cook does $100 million or pledges it to Black Lives Matter.
[02:45:22.025 --> 02:45:24.527]  He needs revolution in America.
[02:45:24.527 --> 02:45:26.128]  And then what does Tim Cook do?
[02:45:26.128 --> 02:45:32.834]  Runs the worst factories, contracts them out in China with 3 million Uyghurs building many of the Apple components.
[02:45:32.834 --> 02:45:34.235]  And he knows damn well what he's doing.
[02:45:34.235 --> 02:45:34.736]  He loves it.
[02:45:35.902 --> 02:45:41.725]  Communist China a few years ago said, would you pay workers a little bit more, and maybe they'd actually have houses to live in.
[02:45:41.725 --> 02:45:43.566]  He said, no, we'll leave.
[02:45:43.566 --> 02:45:47.028]  But see, it's okay, because Tim Cook's trendy, and he talks with a lisp.
[02:45:47.028 --> 02:45:55.452]  And as long as you talk with a lisp, it's all a camouflage cover for these psychotic monsters.
[02:45:55.452 --> 02:45:59.334]  Real psychos, the high-functioning ones, always have a gimmick.
[02:46:00.374 --> 02:46:01.997]  Oh, they're driving an ice cream truck.
[02:46:01.997 --> 02:46:03.218]  Oh, they've got a puppy.
[02:46:03.218 --> 02:46:05.722]  Oh, they've got a little yellow Volkswagen.
[02:46:05.722 --> 02:46:06.743]  They're non-threatening.
[02:46:06.743 --> 02:46:12.151]  We'd like to take you for, you know, a Coca-Cola, young 16-year-old girl.
[02:46:12.151 --> 02:46:14.294]  Well, they just do it on a mass scale.
[02:46:14.294 --> 02:46:15.195]  They're not trolling.
[02:46:16.147 --> 02:46:21.211]  Like some of the people you've seen at Penn State, you know, there at the elementary school.
[02:46:21.211 --> 02:46:21.851]  No, no, no.
[02:46:21.851 --> 02:46:35.261]  These are the individuals that do this on a mass scale, scientifically, and then have armies of lawyers and politicians and PR firms roll it out with a cover story of why they're doing it.
[02:46:35.261 --> 02:46:38.103]  But you scratch the surface, they're cold-blooded killers.
[02:46:38.103 --> 02:46:42.887]  But the good news is, Congressman Scalise has sent letters that they're starting an investigation.
[02:46:44.025 --> 02:46:45.626]  To these Democrat governors.
[02:46:45.626 --> 02:46:47.428]  Now it's 10 confirmed.
[02:46:47.428 --> 02:46:48.869]  They were not told by Trump.
[02:46:48.869 --> 02:46:52.671]  They were not told by his administration to put people in nursing homes.
[02:46:52.671 --> 02:46:54.573]  They were following the U.N.
[02:46:54.573 --> 02:46:56.714]  directive of the W.H.O.
[02:46:56.714 --> 02:47:03.579]  because they knew they had to hit some real death numbers so they could put people with pneumonias and with flus to also test positive for COVID.
[02:47:03.579 --> 02:47:04.840]  The tests that Gates put out are fraud.
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:06.001]  He's been shut down by the FDA for it.
[02:47:06.001 --> 02:47:06.962]  Just total proof.
[02:47:06.962 --> 02:47:07.702]  See right there?
[02:47:07.702 --> 02:47:10.825]  Even the FDA that he pretty much controls still shut his ass down on such fraud.
[02:47:11.365 --> 02:47:13.468]  Because he was creating hysteria with all his fake tests.
[02:47:13.468 --> 02:47:14.910]  His tests are sheltered by the millions.
[02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:17.854]  They had to send people who are actually sick to the nursing homes knowing it's a death sentence.
[02:47:17.854 --> 02:47:24.163]  The default position is never allow someone into a nursing home who actually doesn't need the nursing.
[02:47:24.163 --> 02:47:24.583]  Remember?
[02:47:24.583 --> 02:47:26.586]  Healthy patients, but that it tested positive.
[02:47:26.586 --> 02:47:26.646]  Oh.
[02:47:27.307 --> 02:47:28.808]  But they've got a virus.
[02:47:28.808 --> 02:47:39.531]  Stick them in there, bring a bunch of people in there, bring a bunch of homeless people and folks in that have got a whole bunch of different bacteria and viruses and kill off the old folks, then slap COVID on it.
[02:47:39.531 --> 02:47:46.593]  And the hospitals and nursing homes will go along with it because they're getting an extra 52 plus grand on average for carrying out the mafia hit.
[02:47:46.593 --> 02:47:50.194]  And the best hitmen, you know, kill people for that type of money.
[02:47:50.194 --> 02:47:51.695]  So this is hitman money.
[02:47:51.695 --> 02:47:53.735]  Now 60,000 people that died in the nursing homes.
[02:47:55.496 --> 02:48:03.259]  Think about the diabolical, premeditated nature of them not letting their families in to see them, saying you might have something, but bringing people in that they knew were positive.
[02:48:03.259 --> 02:48:21.145]  Those are the same states, same protocols, same buildings, and they have monsters funded by Soros and put into power by the New York Attorney General, Letitia James, who ordered and threatened to arrest any nursing home owners or directors that didn't submit and didn't join her in the criminal activity and in the murder.
[02:48:21.145 --> 02:48:24.206]  And the premeditation goes on and on and on and on.
[02:48:26.988 --> 02:48:28.249]  And it's all coordinated.
[02:48:28.249 --> 02:48:29.749]  It's all in battle plans.
[02:48:29.749 --> 02:48:38.974]  It's all drawn up by these sick, evil people by Gates, who's always out there telling you, oh, you know, kill an old lady, you can hire 10 teachers, which is all just made up baloney as well.
[02:48:38.974 --> 02:48:41.795]  He's teaching you that you get ahead by others dying.
[02:48:41.795 --> 02:48:42.576]  It's eugenics.
[02:48:42.576 --> 02:48:44.156]  It's death cult programming.
[02:48:44.156 --> 02:48:46.738]  All right, folks, back to the live transmission.
[02:48:46.738 --> 02:48:48.018]  Got more special reports coming up.
[02:48:48.018 --> 02:48:48.899]  They're extremely critical.
[02:48:49.739 --> 02:48:51.180]  Please spread the word about the live transmission.
[02:48:51.180 --> 02:48:56.043]  We can overpower these monsters, but you've got to get excited, you've got to get aggressive, and you've got to realize you are the Paul Revere.
[02:48:56.043 --> 02:48:57.404]  That's not rhetoric, that's fact.
[02:48:57.404 --> 02:48:59.485]  You are just as important as this broadcast.
[02:48:59.485 --> 02:49:00.986]  You don't take action, they win.
[02:49:00.986 --> 02:49:02.267]  You want them to win.
[02:49:02.267 --> 02:49:05.789]  Get aggressive, spread the word, by any means legally necessary.
[02:49:05.789 --> 02:49:06.570]  Back to the live transmission.
[02:49:06.570 --> 02:49:11.113]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms.
[02:49:11.734 --> 02:49:15.582]  ...is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[02:49:15.582 --> 02:49:19.570]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[02:49:20.233 --> 02:49:26.100]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:32.747]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[02:49:32.747 --> 02:49:41.216]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[02:49:42.057 --> 02:49:43.918]  They've admitted all of this.
[02:49:43.918 --> 02:49:51.561]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen?
[02:49:51.561 --> 02:49:55.742]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[02:49:55.742 --> 02:49:56.963]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[02:49:56.963 --> 02:49:58.223]  And yes, it's scary.
[02:49:58.223 --> 02:50:02.445]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[02:50:02.445 --> 02:50:05.446]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[02:50:13.021 --> 02:50:21.299]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[02:50:23.030 --> 02:50:24.871]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[02:50:24.871 --> 02:50:28.234]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[02:50:28.234 --> 02:50:34.998]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[02:50:34.998 --> 02:50:40.301]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[02:50:40.301 --> 02:50:42.783]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[02:50:42.783 --> 02:50:43.624]  That's why now
[02:50:44.244 --> 02:50:54.092]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation, they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[02:50:54.092 --> 02:50:58.395]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[02:50:58.395 --> 02:51:02.659]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[02:51:02.659 --> 02:51:09.925]  InfoWars.com lives!
[02:51:09.925 --> 02:51:12.547]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:17.665 --> 02:51:28.412]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:51:28.412 --> 02:51:33.175]  We are live on this Tuesday edition of the 4th Hour.
[02:51:33.175 --> 02:51:37.758]  We're going to get into a ton of news stories on the other side of the break.
[02:51:37.758 --> 02:51:39.399]  I'll let Sut through some of them now.
[02:51:40.279 --> 02:51:55.342]  As you know, CHAZ, the Seattle Autonomous Protest Zone, the occupied area of downtown Seattle, which is occupied by armed left-wing extremists and Black Lives Matter demonstrators, has seen a spate of violence.
[02:51:55.342 --> 02:51:58.643]  300% increase in violent crime, according to the police.
[02:51:58.643 --> 02:52:03.264]  People who live nearby say they hear screams like they've never heard screams before.
[02:52:03.264 --> 02:52:05.164]  These are not the screams of protesters.
[02:52:06.181 --> 02:52:08.262]  We've seen violent attacks.
[02:52:08.262 --> 02:52:12.903]  We've seen teenagers being handed assault rifles, completely illegal.
[02:52:12.903 --> 02:52:14.943]  We've seen mob justice.
[02:52:14.943 --> 02:52:16.584]  We've seen routine fights.
[02:52:16.584 --> 02:52:22.505]  We've seen people chased down the street, being accused of theft, whether they've burgled anyone or not.
[02:52:22.505 --> 02:52:25.426]  People dragged to the floor, choked out.
[02:52:25.426 --> 02:52:30.847]  Of course, the police response times have tripled, if they're even able to get near the area at all.
[02:52:32.535 --> 02:52:36.078]  It's basically a mobocracy of left-wing extremists.
[02:52:36.078 --> 02:52:47.709]  They literally tried to engage in a game of dodgeball a couple of nights ago and they couldn't even get through a game of dodgeball without it ending in a massive fight.
[02:52:47.709 --> 02:52:51.553]  We see violence on a daily basis and how does the media report it?
[02:52:51.553 --> 02:52:54.836]  Well of course the mayor of Seattle got up on CNN
[02:52:55.740 --> 02:53:04.967]  And said it was peaceful, that it was not an armed takeover, despite numerous video footage and images showing that that's exactly what it was.
[02:53:04.967 --> 02:53:09.291]  Of course, the first thing they did was build a wall to keep anyone out they didn't like.
[02:53:09.291 --> 02:53:11.592]  That hasn't really worked very well.
[02:53:11.592 --> 02:53:17.277]  Because every day at this point, people march through the area carrying American flags and almost get lynched.
[02:53:19.105 --> 02:53:20.687]  CNN said it was peaceful.
[02:53:20.687 --> 02:53:23.391]  Numerous TikTok bloggers have said it's peaceful.
[02:53:23.391 --> 02:53:25.614]  And now this from Bloomberg Businessweek.
[02:53:26.730 --> 02:53:30.071]  Community not anarchy inside Seattle's protest zone.
[02:53:30.071 --> 02:53:35.933]  The cops are gone but the area hasn't devolved into violent disorder as President Trump claims.
[02:53:35.933 --> 02:53:40.094]  Either you're blind or you're lying because that's exactly what happened.
[02:53:40.094 --> 02:53:45.436]  How many videos do we need to see of people getting dragged to the ground, punched in the face?
[02:53:45.436 --> 02:53:47.556]  And these aren't even Trump people.
[02:53:47.556 --> 02:53:49.557]  These aren't right-wing infiltrators.
[02:53:49.557 --> 02:53:52.938]  These are their own people that they're beating up on a daily basis.
[02:53:52.938 --> 02:53:53.278]  Oh but it's
[02:53:53.898 --> 02:53:55.079]  So peaceful.
[02:53:55.079 --> 02:53:56.719]  Rape has gone through the roof.
[02:53:56.719 --> 02:54:05.763]  People are hearing the screams of women being sexually assaulted, but it's a summer of love, according to the mayor of Seattle, and she wouldn't lie to you at all, would she?
[02:54:05.763 --> 02:54:10.565]  And they're even targeting her, even though she's fully on board with them.
[02:54:10.565 --> 02:54:20.490]  Meanwhile, CNN has compiled a list of unforgivable statues and place names, obviously painting a giant target on their back for the mob to drag them down to.
[02:54:21.940 --> 02:54:26.162]  I mean, it's not enough that dozens of people have already died as a result of these riots.
[02:54:26.162 --> 02:54:31.684]  It's not enough that a statue literally landed on somebody's head and put him in a coma.
[02:54:31.684 --> 02:54:32.885]  No, they want more chaos.
[02:54:32.885 --> 02:54:34.946]  They want more Bedlam.
[02:54:34.946 --> 02:54:35.746]  Knockout game!
[02:54:35.746 --> 02:54:39.227]  92-year-old woman assaulted in broad daylight in Manhattan.
[02:54:39.227 --> 02:54:44.650]  African-American male just knocks out a 92-year-old white woman with a stroller on the street.
[02:54:44.650 --> 02:54:46.451]  Is the news media even reporting it?
[02:54:46.451 --> 02:54:48.571]  Barely, if at all.
[02:54:48.571 --> 02:54:49.732]  Not the right narrative.
[02:54:51.050 --> 02:54:54.474]  Rioters tearing down statue, chase man down the street and attack him.
[02:54:54.474 --> 02:54:56.195]  Man shoots assailant in self-defense.
[02:54:56.195 --> 02:54:58.998]  It obviously was self-defense.
[02:54:58.998 --> 02:55:01.481]  Again, that's not getting much play in the media.
[02:55:01.481 --> 02:55:11.290]  Despite the fact you would think that they could hijack that, being the narrative of this, you know, random militia man, they claim, shooting up Black Lives Matter protesters.
[02:55:11.290 --> 02:55:12.572]  You think they'd be on top of that?
[02:55:12.572 --> 02:55:12.692]  Well,
[02:55:13.504 --> 02:55:17.865]  Not really, because he's viciously attacked in the moments before he shoots at them.
[02:55:17.865 --> 02:55:25.187]  Not the brightest idea to try and viciously assault somebody who is armed with a gun, but again, these aren't the brightest people.
[02:55:25.187 --> 02:55:31.328]  Olympia Mayer, who supported Black Lives Matter, calls protest vandalism at her home domestic terrorism.
[02:55:31.328 --> 02:55:34.389]  Gonna get into that, it's absolutely hilarious.
[02:55:34.389 --> 02:55:40.730]  The Boston Mayor is saying he's gonna remove a statue of Abraham Lincoln, the man who literally fought a war to end slavery.
[02:55:41.798 --> 02:55:45.241]  Woke mobs are now destroying statues of leading anti-slavery figures.
[02:55:45.241 --> 02:55:49.405]  They don't care because it's not about slavery, it's about overthrowing America.
[02:55:49.405 --> 02:55:53.229]  It's not about the Confederacy, it's about America.
[02:55:53.229 --> 02:55:57.133]  Police officer shot in the head during BLM protest is paralysed from the neck down.
[02:55:57.133 --> 02:56:00.536]  Again, not too many mainstream media headlines about him.
[02:56:01.630 --> 02:56:10.925]  And now de Blasio in New York is literally welding shut gates in Jewish areas because he doesn't want kids in there, meanwhile advocating mass gatherings of tens of thousands of people.
[02:56:10.925 --> 02:56:13.369]  We'll get into it all on the other side, summit.news.go away.
[02:56:15.242 --> 02:56:16.242]  It's finally here.
[02:56:16.242 --> 02:56:21.105]  Introducing the first of its kind nascent iodine spray with true atomic iodine.
[02:56:21.105 --> 02:56:27.707]  Lister's have been asking us for months to develop an iodine spray made with our exclusive deep earth crystal nascent iodine.
[02:56:27.707 --> 02:56:29.768]  After extensive development, it's finally here.
[02:56:29.768 --> 02:56:38.572]  Our proprietary new Aerodyne technology allows us to harness the full power of ancient iodine crystals from 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface into an ultimate spray formula.
[02:56:38.852 --> 02:56:45.358]  I have been using the new X2 spray every day and I feel good knowing that I have the power of truthnascent iodine working for my body.
[02:56:45.358 --> 02:56:46.919]  I can personally feel the difference.
[02:56:46.919 --> 02:56:55.046]  We know iodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health as well as healthy metabolism, healthy hormone levels, and healthy cognitive function.
[02:56:55.046 --> 02:56:59.470]  Iodine may also support your body in healthy response to environmental and dietary toxins.
[02:56:59.870 --> 02:57:04.873]  Get your daily dose of essential iodine and experience the benefits of true nascent iodine today.
[02:57:04.873 --> 02:57:12.338]  Get the new Survival Shield X2 spray for 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com before we sell out of our new limited first shipment.
[02:57:12.338 --> 02:57:18.222]  That's InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:18.222 --> 02:57:27.769]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:37.683]  So as you know, last Monday, left-wing extremists took over an area of downtown Seattle and named it Chaz.
[02:57:37.683 --> 02:57:51.989]  They later renamed it to Chop because they wanted to send a message that anyone who resisted, as people did in the French Revolution, that's how they would be dealt with by getting the chop, literally by getting their heads chopped off.
[02:57:51.989 --> 02:57:54.130]  But CNN says it's peaceful.
[02:57:54.130 --> 02:57:56.631]  The mayor of Seattle says it's a summer of love.
[02:57:56.631 --> 02:57:57.431]  We've literally got
[02:57:58.477 --> 02:58:10.319]  Armed SoundCloud rappers and their gang members patrolling this area, armed with semi-automatics, handing out semi-automatics to teenagers, calling it chop.
[02:58:10.319 --> 02:58:13.740]  They have fights every night with each other.
[02:58:13.740 --> 02:58:20.041]  Whenever anyone tries to walk through there with an American flag or a MAGA hat, they almost get lynched.
[02:58:20.041 --> 02:58:22.401]  They're routine fights, again, with each other.
[02:58:22.401 --> 02:58:27.422]  Every single night there was a Christian preacher who was dragged to the ground and choked out.
[02:58:28.314 --> 02:58:31.476]  Violent crime is up 300%.
[02:58:31.476 --> 02:58:41.403]  Residents who live in the area, there was a guy who did an interview with the Daily Caller who said this, say that they hear screams like they've never heard screams before.
[02:58:41.403 --> 02:58:45.446]  They hear gunshots in the night like they've never heard before.
[02:58:45.446 --> 02:58:48.928]  This is basically turning into Chicago on steroids.
[02:58:48.928 --> 02:58:50.329]  Chirac on steroids.
[02:58:51.468 --> 02:58:56.771]  They've got mob justice, they chase people down the streets who are accused of theft, whether they are or not.
[02:58:56.771 --> 02:58:59.773]  They beat them up on many occasions.
[02:58:59.773 --> 02:59:00.813]  They beat each other up.
[02:59:00.813 --> 02:59:02.274]  This is a mobocracy.
[02:59:02.274 --> 02:59:04.495]  This is absolute bedlam.
[02:59:04.495 --> 02:59:07.917]  The police can't even get near it on many occasions.
[02:59:07.917 --> 02:59:10.098]  People are overdosing on drugs.
[02:59:10.098 --> 02:59:13.340]  They're lucky to get out of there, as you see here from the clip.
[02:59:13.340 --> 02:59:16.021]  Guy walked through with a MAGA hat.
[02:59:16.021 --> 02:59:16.922]  Almost got lynched.
[02:59:18.041 --> 02:59:19.422]  How's the media reporting it?
[02:59:19.422 --> 02:59:23.004]  Well, here's a headline from Bloomberg Businessweek.
[02:59:23.004 --> 02:59:27.307]  Community not anarchy inside Seattle's protest zone.
[02:59:27.307 --> 02:59:32.791]  The cops are gone but the area hasn't devolved into violent disorder as president Trump claims.
[02:59:32.791 --> 02:59:34.272]  Yes, it has!
[02:59:34.272 --> 02:59:37.834]  How many videos do we need to see of people getting punched in the face?
[02:59:37.834 --> 02:59:39.375]  Dragged off the stage?
[02:59:39.375 --> 02:59:40.956]  Dragged to the ground?
[02:59:40.956 --> 02:59:45.179]  Most of the violence is protester on protester.
[02:59:46.289 --> 02:59:49.456]  In fact, there's a clip in my latest video.
[02:59:49.456 --> 02:59:57.292]  It shows how it's devolved not only into a violent communist dystopia, but also a kind of Lord of the Flies anarchy.
[02:59:58.419 --> 03:00:00.141]  Where they're bickering amongst each other.
[03:00:00.141 --> 03:00:07.167]  They can't even get a sentence out without somebody bickering and arguing and disagreeing and them screaming at each other on a regular basis.
[03:00:07.167 --> 03:00:11.431]  If this is their communist utopia, I say let them get on with it.
[03:00:11.431 --> 03:00:13.312]  Don't send the police back in.
[03:00:13.312 --> 03:00:16.275]  Let it devolve into absolute bedlam and anarchy.
[03:00:16.275 --> 03:00:20.078]  They keep complaining about how they can't get food, enough food in there.
[03:00:20.078 --> 03:00:24.122]  This is their attempt at gardening, just a giant mound of dirt.
[03:00:24.122 --> 03:00:25.343]  I say leave them to it!
[03:00:26.721 --> 03:00:30.262]  But according to the media, it's going great!
[03:00:30.262 --> 03:00:33.763]  This article says, Dasha Turner liked what she saw.
[03:00:33.763 --> 03:00:40.285]  Looking at the vegetable garden that had just been planted, she said she felt good about her decision to bring her six-year-old daughter.
[03:00:40.285 --> 03:00:43.005]  You're bringing your daughter to this?
[03:00:43.005 --> 03:00:47.827]  To a part of Seattle that President Trump recently described as being taken over by ugly anarchists.
[03:00:47.827 --> 03:00:49.587]  Which is precisely what happened.
[03:00:49.587 --> 03:00:51.808]  And they are ugly as well, by the way.
[03:00:51.808 --> 03:00:52.328]  On Sunday,
[03:00:53.382 --> 03:00:58.086]  The park and many surrounding blocks in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood have been turned over to art.
[03:00:58.086 --> 03:01:15.081]  What happens is all these mainstream journalists and all these TikTok bloggers and all these idiot blue check marks go there for like two hours in the day, like 12 midday to 2pm, when they're not all screaming at each other drunk and beating each other up.
[03:01:15.081 --> 03:01:17.824]  They walk around the main bit, the safest bit,
[03:01:18.379 --> 03:01:20.420]  For about an hour and a half.
[03:01:20.420 --> 03:01:24.562]  And they come along and say, oh it's so peaceful, it's just like a big farmer's market.
[03:01:24.562 --> 03:01:31.586]  As soon as night falls, they're all like trying to break into the, whatever businesses are left open.
[03:01:31.586 --> 03:01:38.069]  Any business that dares to remain open, that even Virtue signals with all the BLM signs in the window.
[03:01:38.069 --> 03:01:40.510]  Now they're getting smashed up.
[03:01:40.510 --> 03:01:45.673]  Mob, roaming mobs handing out semi-automatic guns to teenagers, completely illegal.
[03:01:47.043 --> 03:01:50.184]  Again, they had a dodgeball game which ended up in a massive argument.
[03:01:50.184 --> 03:01:52.725]  They're punching each other in the face.
[03:01:52.725 --> 03:01:53.725]  Oh, but it's peaceful.
[03:01:53.725 --> 03:01:56.426]  It's just like a giant farmer's market.
[03:01:56.426 --> 03:01:59.287]  You can take your kids.
[03:01:59.287 --> 03:02:03.929]  People lounged on the ball fields as the DJ spun records.
[03:02:03.929 --> 03:02:05.270]  Parents pushed baby strollers.
[03:02:05.270 --> 03:02:07.430]  There was more than one labradoodle.
[03:02:07.430 --> 03:02:08.331]  Nowhere to be found.
[03:02:08.331 --> 03:02:09.471]  The police.
[03:02:09.471 --> 03:02:12.332]  There's literally graffiti on every wall saying, kill the police.
[03:02:12.332 --> 03:02:13.853]  It's so peaceful.
[03:02:13.853 --> 03:02:14.533]  So tolerant.
[03:02:15.703 --> 03:02:19.126]  This is what a true community looks like, said Turner.
[03:02:19.126 --> 03:02:21.448]  This is why we're a threat to President Trump.
[03:02:21.448 --> 03:02:22.730]  You're a threat to each other!
[03:02:22.730 --> 03:02:25.272]  People are literally shooting at each other.
[03:02:25.272 --> 03:02:29.136]  Hasn't somebody died already as well?
[03:02:29.136 --> 03:02:35.822]  Since the Seattle Police Department vacated its East Precinct last week, vacated, they were literally chased out of there by a violent mob.
[03:02:35.822 --> 03:02:40.266]  The area has taken on the vibe of a street festival.
[03:02:43.075 --> 03:02:49.759]  They literally give speeches saying people who anger us, people who are dissidents, will get their heads chopped off.
[03:02:49.759 --> 03:02:52.220]  It's a street festival.
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:54.461]  Headline.
[03:02:54.461 --> 03:02:59.784]  Chas occupier suggests rounding up all the white people into work brigades.
[03:02:59.784 --> 03:03:00.885]  What if they don't want to?
[03:03:00.885 --> 03:03:03.426]  Well, just maybe just do what happened in the French Revolution.
[03:03:04.104 --> 03:03:17.971]  A post that appeared on the subreddit for Seattle Chas Autonomous Zone, now renamed CHOP because they want to chop people's heads off so peaceful, that has been taken over by left-wing extremists suggests rounding up all the white people and organizing them into forced work brigades.
[03:03:17.971 --> 03:03:20.132]  So tolerant!
[03:03:20.132 --> 03:03:22.573]  Manual labor gulags!
[03:03:22.573 --> 03:03:24.374]  So progressive!
[03:03:24.374 --> 03:03:31.998]  That's right, some of the very same people protesting against racism and slavery want to enslave people based on their skin color.
[03:03:31.998 --> 03:03:33.099]  So progressive!
[03:03:34.252 --> 03:03:42.395]  The discussion appears to be focused around identifying potential white supremacists who are trying to infiltrate CHAZ, which is basically anyone but themselves.
[03:03:42.395 --> 03:03:48.357]  A six-block area of downtown Seattle, occupied by Antifa and BLM supporters.
[03:03:48.357 --> 03:03:54.919]  The area has now been renamed CHOP, as I just discussed, because the French revolutionaries were so peaceful.
[03:03:54.919 --> 03:03:56.680]  And then it gets to this Reddit post.
[03:03:58.078 --> 03:04:00.939]  Where somebody says, I can help keep a lookout for them.
[03:04:00.939 --> 03:04:01.759]  What do they look like?
[03:04:01.759 --> 03:04:05.561]  They're talking about imaginary white supremacists, which they think are everywhere.
[03:04:05.561 --> 03:04:08.182]  What are the signs to identify them?
[03:04:08.182 --> 03:04:10.522]  I would think going up to ask them is dangerous.
[03:04:10.522 --> 03:04:13.183]  Anyone that is white, said a respondent.
[03:04:13.183 --> 03:04:16.904]  So anyone that's white is a white supremacist.
[03:04:16.904 --> 03:04:26.868]  And then this other person said, quote, I genuinely don't understand why we don't just round up all the white people in Chas and put them to work tending the crops and other such tasks.
[03:04:27.802 --> 03:04:35.844]  Things would be far more efficient with a large workforce and it would act as a way of keeping the white menace under control.
[03:04:35.844 --> 03:04:43.666]  Literally most of the people there, probably about 60% all white, if not more.
[03:04:43.666 --> 03:04:48.668]  So put like 67% of them on work gulag forms, great.
[03:04:48.668 --> 03:04:53.569]  We can have an armed supervisor to watch over them as they work so there's no risk of any racist backlash.
[03:04:54.167 --> 03:05:02.671]  They're literally describing the equivalent of putting slaves to work in cotton fields overwatched by armed white supremacists.
[03:05:02.671 --> 03:05:05.572]  It's literally the reverse.
[03:05:05.572 --> 03:05:06.833]  But still the same thing.
[03:05:06.833 --> 03:05:15.697]  It was previously revealed that BLM occupiers were demanding white people each hand over $10 to their Chas comrades as a form of reparations.
[03:05:15.697 --> 03:05:16.737]  No, that's not enough.
[03:05:16.737 --> 03:05:21.539]  You need to make them tend the crops in forced gulags.
[03:05:21.539 --> 03:05:22.860]  That's progressive.
[03:05:23.760 --> 03:05:30.343]  And again, we know they're not progressive, and if you said that to them, they would tell you, no, we're not progressive, we're violent radicals.
[03:05:30.343 --> 03:05:31.903]  We want to overthrow the government.
[03:05:31.903 --> 03:05:34.204]  They'll be honest with you in many cases.
[03:05:34.204 --> 03:05:35.265]  That's not my problem.
[03:05:35.265 --> 03:05:37.346]  The problem is the media.
[03:05:37.346 --> 03:05:39.647]  Bloomberg Businessweek.
[03:05:39.647 --> 03:05:43.268]  The cops are gone, but the area hasn't devolved into violent disorder.
[03:05:43.268 --> 03:05:46.229]  Yes, it has, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[03:05:46.229 --> 03:05:48.850]  They'll probably send the police in.
[03:05:48.850 --> 03:05:49.851]  Within a week or so.
[03:05:51.039 --> 03:05:52.400]  I say leave them to it.
[03:05:52.400 --> 03:05:53.641]  It's hilarious.
[03:05:53.641 --> 03:05:56.223]  The content out of this is just never-ending.
[03:05:56.223 --> 03:05:59.165]  Chaz is the gif that keeps on giving.
[03:05:59.165 --> 03:06:03.548]  Man wearing MAGA hat carrying American flag walks through Chaz.
[03:06:03.548 --> 03:06:19.720]  Now to their credit, because some of the individuals in this area are aware of optics and aware of the fact that it doesn't look too great if they're literally pummeling and beating up Trump supporters on a daily basis, some of these individuals that you see here
[03:06:20.896 --> 03:06:27.240]  The minority, as you can see, desperately try to keep the mob away from lynching this guy.
[03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:36.247]  He walks through the entire area, gets his flag stolen by some white Antifa, gets his hat stolen by some white Antifa.
[03:06:36.247 --> 03:06:38.868]  They manage to get it back.
[03:06:38.868 --> 03:06:42.311]  He eventually gets to this area where they just pin him up against this fence.
[03:06:43.303 --> 03:06:57.252]  And the only way he can get out of the area with any degree of respect, I guess, although it takes a lot of courage to walk through there, even if you're not carrying an American flag, if you don't identify with them, he has to sell the flag.
[03:06:57.252 --> 03:07:03.816]  And then finally, as he's being berated and almost lynched, he's finally able to leave the area.
[03:07:03.816 --> 03:07:04.817]  This is Chas.
[03:07:04.817 --> 03:07:05.838]  It's so peaceful.
[03:07:05.838 --> 03:07:06.998]  It's so progressive.
[03:07:06.998 --> 03:07:10.060]  It's so tolerant, according to the mainstream media.
[03:07:10.060 --> 03:07:10.641]  Don't go away.
[03:07:10.641 --> 03:07:11.621]  We'll be right back.
[03:07:11.621 --> 03:07:12.502]  Summit.News.

[03:07:45.717 --> 03:07:46.978]  Mmm.
[03:07:46.978 --> 03:07:50.360]  I just devoured your cousin's M415 Protein Bar.

[03:08:12.717 --> 03:08:16.259]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[03:08:16.259 --> 03:08:20.541]  Coffee and energy drinks provide a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[03:08:20.541 --> 03:08:24.823]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go, TurboForce.
[03:08:25.123 --> 03:08:34.294]  TurboForce from Infowars Life utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used across the globe to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[03:08:34.294 --> 03:08:38.779]  TurboForce is a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[03:08:38.779 --> 03:08:42.444]  Try adding this to your daily routine and revolutionize your day today!
[03:08:43.243 --> 03:08:46.884]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[03:08:46.884 --> 03:08:53.966]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[03:08:53.966 --> 03:08:57.947]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy, and delicious drinking water.
[03:08:57.947 --> 03:09:04.209]  Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with a healthier source of water, the Alexa Pure Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities.
[03:09:04.209 --> 03:09:09.210]  This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[03:09:09.210 --> 03:09:12.111]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[03:09:15.345 --> 03:09:18.446]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:09:18.446 --> 03:09:36.995]  Live from the Summit.News Headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:09:41.749 --> 03:09:49.692]  22 people have died as a result of the riots after the death of George Floyd.
[03:09:49.692 --> 03:09:55.694]  22 people, 19 of those from gunshots, and there was almost another death yesterday.
[03:09:55.694 --> 03:10:00.495]  And that death toll includes protesters and police, by the way.
[03:10:00.495 --> 03:10:07.557]  This headline out of Information Liberation video, rioters tearing down statue, chase man down and attack him.
[03:10:07.557 --> 03:10:09.638]  Man shoots assailant in self-defense.
[03:10:10.273 --> 03:10:22.460]  This is the second time that somebody has almost died as a result of the absolute anarchy, chaos and bedlam from this violent, angry mob trying to tear down statues.
[03:10:22.460 --> 03:10:28.564]  A violent mob of rioters trying to tear down a statue in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and they did.
[03:10:28.564 --> 03:10:36.248]  On Monday, a film chasing down a man in the streets and attacking him with fists and a skateboard only for the man to shoot one in self-defense.
[03:10:36.248 --> 03:10:37.009]  Now, this guy
[03:10:37.768 --> 03:10:39.928]  To be fair, was being belligerent before.
[03:10:39.928 --> 03:10:43.469]  He was assaulting people in the crowd.
[03:10:43.469 --> 03:10:50.151]  Then he was subjected to an assault himself, as he saw whacked with a skateboard, chased down the street.
[03:10:50.151 --> 03:10:55.272]  I think at the last point, there's two or three or four of them trying to beat him to death.
[03:10:55.272 --> 03:10:58.292]  He probably... People have been killed from this.
[03:10:58.292 --> 03:10:59.113]  People have been killed.
[03:10:59.113 --> 03:11:00.713]  You know the police captain who was killed?
[03:11:01.736 --> 03:11:04.157]  Others have been killed from being beaten up in the streets.
[03:11:04.157 --> 03:11:08.559]  His life was on the line, and he acted in total self-defence.
[03:11:08.559 --> 03:11:13.161]  The media's not really picking up on this, because they can't use their victimhood narrative.
[03:11:13.161 --> 03:11:19.284]  But the media and Twitter arty were reporting on the story as a white supremacist attack on peaceful protesters.
[03:11:19.284 --> 03:11:26.507]  But the narrative collapsed after video surfaced showing the lynch mob chasing the man down, pulling him, throwing him to the ground and bashing him with a skateboard.
[03:11:26.507 --> 03:11:28.688]  The man then fired back in self-defence.
[03:11:29.998 --> 03:11:41.481]  Unconfirmed reports claim the man was trying to protect the statue, which was probably a forlorn task given that he was on his own, and could have been part of a patriot group called the New Mexico Civil Guard.
[03:11:41.481 --> 03:11:44.702]  If that was the case, where were the other members of the group?
[03:11:44.702 --> 03:11:51.024]  Democratic New Mexico Governor Michelle Grisham issued a statement after the above video had surfaced where she sided with the mob.
[03:11:51.024 --> 03:11:52.744]  What a shocker.
[03:11:52.744 --> 03:11:55.005]  Convicted the patriot group without evidence or trial,
[03:11:56.443 --> 03:12:00.667]  I saw many tweets saying that this alleged patriot group doesn't even exist, by the way.
[03:12:00.667 --> 03:12:08.794]  Neglected to mention that the rioters were tearing down a statue and said she's praying for the attacker and suggested it doesn't matter who strikes first.
[03:12:08.794 --> 03:12:11.236]  Of course, that victimhood narrative.
[03:12:11.236 --> 03:12:12.557]  Perpetual victimhood.
[03:12:12.557 --> 03:12:13.838]  It doesn't matter who strikes first.
[03:12:13.838 --> 03:12:16.520]  They can be beating you to a pulp on the streets.
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:17.841]  It's your fault because you're white.
[03:12:17.841 --> 03:12:18.982]  You're racist.
[03:12:18.982 --> 03:12:20.563]  So someone almost died from that.
[03:12:20.563 --> 03:12:23.406]  A BLM activist did die.
[03:12:24.221 --> 03:12:28.985]  Not at the hands of a white supremacist, but at the hands of a black man.
[03:12:28.985 --> 03:12:31.186]  That doesn't really fit the narrative either, does it?
[03:12:31.186 --> 03:12:39.713]  Again, Information Liberation reports, BLM activists who said white racists are the enemy, allegedly murdered by black men in Tallahassee.
[03:12:39.713 --> 03:12:49.320]  Korea criminal Aaron Lee Jr., 49, was arrested over the weekend by the Orlando Police Department on warrants out of Leon County in connection with the deaths of Black Lives Matter activists
[03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:51.701]  No chance of pronouncing that name.
[03:12:51.701 --> 03:12:53.242]  19 years old.
[03:12:53.242 --> 03:12:56.965]  An ARP volunteer, Victoria Sims, 75.
[03:12:56.965 --> 03:13:04.450]  Salau was a BLM activist who recently told protesters to remember that white racists are the enemy.
[03:13:04.450 --> 03:13:07.472]  I saw this on Twitter a couple of days ago.
[03:13:07.472 --> 03:13:13.256]  People were hyperventilating over a Black Lives Matter activist as being killed.
[03:13:13.256 --> 03:13:15.577]  When it came out, she was killed by a black man.
[03:13:15.577 --> 03:13:18.680]  Kind of disappeared in a hurry.
[03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:19.160]  Meanwhile,
[03:13:20.802 --> 03:13:28.668]  The Blaze reports Olympian Mayor who supported Black Lives Matter calls protest vandalism at her home domestic terrorism.
[03:13:28.668 --> 03:13:30.450]  You can't but not laugh at this.
[03:13:30.450 --> 03:13:34.953]  There's a picture of the front of her house or a residence, whatever it is.
[03:13:34.953 --> 03:13:36.575]  Mayor's residence, I guess.
[03:13:36.575 --> 03:13:39.777]  She's got a BLM sign in the window.
[03:13:39.777 --> 03:13:46.563]  She's got an LGBT rainbow flag hung outside and yet her property still gets vandalized.
[03:13:47.296 --> 03:13:52.437]  And it looks like he's literally spray painting BLM on the wall of her house.
[03:13:52.437 --> 03:13:55.838]  And she's already got a sign that says BLM in the window.
[03:13:55.838 --> 03:13:58.559]  So she double caved.
[03:13:58.559 --> 03:14:00.680]  You've got the BLM sign.
[03:14:00.680 --> 03:14:02.900]  She's got the LGBT flag.
[03:14:02.900 --> 03:14:04.341]  Not good enough.
[03:14:04.341 --> 03:14:05.221]  Not good enough.
[03:14:05.221 --> 03:14:08.002]  Her home was vandalized by the mob.
[03:14:08.002 --> 03:14:11.703]  The mayor of Olympia, Washington, expressed support for the Black Lives Matter cause.
[03:14:12.515 --> 03:14:15.977]  She's literally got all the accoutrements of virtue signalling.
[03:14:15.977 --> 03:14:18.218]  She's publicly expressed support.
[03:14:18.218 --> 03:14:20.379]  No, not good enough.
[03:14:20.379 --> 03:14:24.061]  But when her own home was vandalised, she called it similar to domestic terrorism.
[03:14:24.061 --> 03:14:25.501]  It's like the tweet of that guy.
[03:14:25.501 --> 03:14:28.583]  I think he was some kind of sports presenter.
[03:14:29.608 --> 03:14:34.532]  Who in response to the original Minneapolis riots tweeted, burn it all down!
[03:14:34.532 --> 03:14:40.417]  And then they turned up at his gated community and he suddenly had a hissy fit and did a complete 180.
[03:14:40.417 --> 03:14:44.260]  It was one of the Twitter moments of 2020.
[03:14:44.260 --> 03:14:45.862]  This is similar.
[03:14:45.862 --> 03:14:52.507]  Mayor Cheryl Selby made the comments after her home was vandalized on Friday with Black Lives Matter graffiti.
[03:14:52.507 --> 03:14:54.729]  Though she already displayed support for the movement.
[03:14:55.598 --> 03:14:57.619]  She said, I'm really trying to process this.
[03:14:57.619 --> 03:14:59.100]  It's like domestic terrorism.
[03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:01.822]  It's unfair.
[03:15:01.822 --> 03:15:16.110]  So, everything they've done in the past four weeks, literally 22 people dead, attacking and taking over police stations, choking people half to death, stalking people, going to their houses, trying to attack them.
[03:15:16.110 --> 03:15:17.491]  That's not domestic terrorism.
[03:15:17.491 --> 03:15:24.135]  But as soon as somebody paints a BLM tag, a graffiti tag on the front of their house, then it's domestic terrorism.
[03:15:25.294 --> 03:15:29.216]  Vandalism was part of a process that turned to rioting in downtown Olympia.
[03:15:29.216 --> 03:15:33.118]  Businesses were vandalized with spray paint, flags were burned, windows were smashed.
[03:15:33.118 --> 03:15:39.602]  But only when her house was vandalized did she suddenly have a massive change of heart.
[03:15:39.602 --> 03:15:42.043]  Boston Mayor backs removal of Lincoln statue.
[03:15:42.043 --> 03:15:48.026]  Mrs. Zettelbreitbart opposes renaming Faneuil Hall despite slave history.
[03:15:48.720 --> 03:15:53.802]  This is the Boston Mayor, Marcy Walsh, who's come out in favour of removing a statue of Abraham Lincoln.
[03:15:53.802 --> 03:15:55.943]  Not like he fought a war to end slavery, is it?
[03:15:55.943 --> 03:15:57.283]  No, he has to go too!
[03:15:57.283 --> 03:16:03.506]  Because again, it's not about slavery, it's about overthrowing America.
[03:16:03.506 --> 03:16:06.347]  A statue that has stood in the city for more than a century.
[03:16:07.523 --> 03:16:13.852]  But he's opposed to renaming Faneuil Hall, which is named for a slave owner and is on the site of a slave market.
[03:16:13.852 --> 03:16:22.986]  Left-wing activists are trying to have a statue of Abraham Lincoln removed from Park Square after nearly 150 years because they find the depiction of an emancipated slave in the sculpture to be offensive.
[03:16:23.466 --> 03:16:34.495]  So the statue celebrates Abraham Lincoln for emancipating the slaves, celebrates a freed slave in the statue, but now even that's too offensive.
[03:16:34.495 --> 03:16:35.536]  That's got to go.
[03:16:35.536 --> 03:16:37.898]  Again, because it's a historical monument.
[03:16:37.898 --> 03:16:39.479]  It's about overturning history.
[03:16:39.479 --> 03:16:41.361]  It has nothing to do with slavery.
[03:16:42.631 --> 03:16:45.534]  It's about the long march through the institutions.
[03:16:45.534 --> 03:16:46.495]  Now they control them.
[03:16:46.495 --> 03:16:50.699]  Now they control the media, which says all this is peaceful and progressive.
[03:16:50.699 --> 03:16:52.961]  They can get away with murder.
[03:16:52.961 --> 03:16:55.964]  Literally, in some cases, murder.
[03:16:55.964 --> 03:17:00.829]  We've seen the rioters not being charged, even after they do get arrested.
[03:17:00.829 --> 03:17:02.891]  We've seen the bail money being stolen.
[03:17:02.891 --> 03:17:04.493]  I'm going to get into that story in a moment.
[03:17:05.583 --> 03:17:13.328]  But this says, the statue has stood there since 1879 is a replica of an original statue built with funds contributed by freed slaves.
[03:17:13.328 --> 03:17:17.291]  So they actually, the freed slaves actually contributed to the statue.
[03:17:17.291 --> 03:17:18.332]  No, it's still got to go.
[03:17:18.332 --> 03:17:26.637]  Mayor Walsh's office told the Boston Globe he favours removing the Lincoln statue and replacing it with one that recognises equality.
[03:17:26.637 --> 03:17:28.358]  Again, whatever that means.
[03:17:28.358 --> 03:17:32.281]  He literally freed the slave, literally fought a war, millions of dead to free the slaves.
[03:17:32.281 --> 03:17:33.121]  No, we've got to go.
[03:17:33.121 --> 03:17:33.642]  He's got to go.
[03:17:35.106 --> 03:17:39.349]  Mayor Walter Pose renamed Faneuil Hall a major tourist attraction.
[03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:42.050]  So again, looks like Abraham Lincoln's days are numbered.
[03:17:42.050 --> 03:17:45.272]  Of course, now they're talking about blowing up Mount Rushmore.
[03:17:45.272 --> 03:17:49.555]  That's likely partly going to become part of the debate shortly.
[03:17:49.555 --> 03:17:53.337]  Woke mobs now destroying statues of leading anti-slavery figures.
[03:17:53.337 --> 03:17:54.958]  We'll get into that after the break.
[03:17:54.958 --> 03:18:00.502]  We're also going to get into how Rick Wilson was humiliated by Domino's Pizza Company.
[03:18:01.192 --> 03:18:04.881]  After mistaking a tweet, a modern tweet, for an eight-year-old tweet.
[03:18:04.881 --> 03:18:07.488]  We're going to get into that and more on the other side.
[03:18:07.488 --> 03:18:09.152]  Breaking news at Summit.News.
[03:18:09.152 --> 03:18:09.773]  Don't go away.
[03:18:09.773 --> 03:18:10.555]  Be right back.
[03:18:11.175 --> 03:18:13.616]  I was talking to my Patriot supplier, Great Suppliers.
[03:18:13.616 --> 03:18:16.557]  You can now say four weeks on average for storable food.
[03:18:16.557 --> 03:18:17.637]  It's the highest quality.
[03:18:17.637 --> 03:18:19.057]  They've got it.
[03:18:19.057 --> 03:18:25.459]  Use this little rest we have, caught in the current, to come up to the surface, get some air, before you get sucked back down.
[03:18:25.459 --> 03:18:27.980]  I personally am ordering more storable food.
[03:18:27.980 --> 03:18:31.341]  I have to now start going into defense posture.
[03:18:31.341 --> 03:18:36.182]  80% offense, but I've always been 100% offense, trying to fully, you know, stop the Globeless.
[03:18:36.182 --> 03:18:39.503]  And we've given them a good run, and I think down the road they'll be defeated, but
[03:18:40.746 --> 03:18:43.507]  We're gonna still go down the hard road now.
[03:18:43.507 --> 03:18:49.409]  There were a lot worse roads we'd probably go down, but we've mitigated some of this, but it's still gonna be bad in my view.
[03:18:49.409 --> 03:18:50.929]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[03:18:50.929 --> 03:18:52.110]  It's something you need.
[03:18:52.110 --> 03:18:55.411]  We have high-quality ready to get out to you, and it supports the broadcast.
[03:18:55.411 --> 03:19:03.134]  The 360 wins, so please take care of your storable foods needs at infowarstore.com and get your orders in now, so you get it, so you have it.
[03:19:03.134 --> 03:19:05.935]  It's in great containers, high-quality, lasts 25 years.
[03:19:05.935 --> 03:19:09.936]  Get it while you can, because if you think things are about to let up, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[03:19:10.535 --> 03:19:16.878]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things.
[03:19:16.878 --> 03:19:21.019]  But you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true.
[03:19:21.019 --> 03:19:24.821]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[03:19:24.821 --> 03:19:29.503]  It's like telling somebody if you got a pool, put a fence around it if you have little kids.
[03:19:29.503 --> 03:19:32.244]  Because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[03:19:32.244 --> 03:19:34.545]  People don't listen, they go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[03:19:35.365 --> 03:19:39.508]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[03:19:39.508 --> 03:19:43.371]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists.
[03:19:43.371 --> 03:19:45.972]  And they admit they've orchestrated it.
[03:19:45.972 --> 03:19:48.434]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the earth.
[03:19:48.434 --> 03:19:50.375]  And they're teaching us to be more frugal.
[03:19:50.375 --> 03:19:55.339]  And they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[03:19:55.999 --> 03:20:03.490]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[03:20:03.490 --> 03:20:09.579]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[03:20:11.004 --> 03:20:12.666]  It's finally here.
[03:20:12.666 --> 03:20:16.770]  Introducing the new Survival Shield X2 Spray.

[03:21:04.242 --> 03:21:14.310]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:21:14.310 --> 03:21:16.912]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:24.878 --> 03:21:34.500]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:21:34.500 --> 03:21:44.843]  And while the media continues to tell us that BLM is a peaceful movement, we have to remember that the very foundings of BLM, of course, I've talked about this several times before,
[03:21:45.603 --> 03:21:56.170]  The inspiration, the ideological guru behind Black Lives Matter is a woman called Assata Shakur, who is literally on the FBI's top 10 most wanted terrorists list.
[03:21:56.170 --> 03:21:57.451]  So peaceful.
[03:21:57.451 --> 03:22:01.573]  She's a convicted cop killer in exile in Cuba.
[03:22:01.573 --> 03:22:08.258]  We have to remember that the last round of Black Lives Matter inspired protests or riots
[03:22:09.372 --> 03:22:17.557]  Back in 2016 ended with five Dallas police officers being shot dead by a Black Lives Matter supporter.
[03:22:17.557 --> 03:22:20.558]  Everyone seems to have forgotten about that.
[03:22:20.558 --> 03:22:22.279]  Now we have this headline.
[03:22:22.279 --> 03:22:27.162]  Police officer shot in the head during BLM protest is paralyzed from the neck down.
[03:22:27.162 --> 03:22:30.784]  A police officer was shot in the head during the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Las Vegas.
[03:22:31.542 --> 03:22:34.524]  It's paralyzed from the neck down, according to a statement.
[03:22:34.524 --> 03:22:40.188]  AP reports officer Shea McLonis has been tentatively accepted at a spine rehabilitation center.
[03:22:40.188 --> 03:22:43.010]  She's expected to stay on a ventilator.
[03:22:43.010 --> 03:22:49.055]  20-year-old Edgar Samigo, Sam and Ego, I must say, has been charged with the shooting.
[03:22:50.558 --> 03:22:55.842]  The judge declaring in the video shows him walking by, taking out a gun and firing at officers during the unrest.
[03:22:55.842 --> 03:23:00.065]  So you have a Black Lives Matter supporter literally just walking along and firing at police officers.
[03:23:00.065 --> 03:23:01.246]  So peaceful.
[03:23:01.246 --> 03:23:02.647]  So progressive.
[03:23:02.647 --> 03:23:09.392]  And yet, the polls show that support for Black Lives Matter is higher than ever.
[03:23:09.392 --> 03:23:17.318]  Significantly more support for Black Lives Matter than President Trump, as Tucker Carlson explains in this video, which we're going to roll right now.
[03:23:17.318 --> 03:23:17.738]  Here it is.
[03:23:19.292 --> 03:23:21.474]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.
[03:23:21.474 --> 03:23:24.898]  Here's some bracing news we never expected to report.
[03:23:24.898 --> 03:23:28.803]  Black Lives Matter is now more popular than the President of the United States.
[03:23:28.803 --> 03:23:33.088]  And not slightly more popular than the President, much more popular.
[03:23:33.088 --> 03:23:37.352]  A survey this week by Rasmussen, a right-leaning pollster, found that 62% of likely voters
[03:23:38.894 --> 03:23:42.116]  Now, I have a favorable opinion of Black Lives Matter.
[03:23:42.116 --> 03:23:45.278]  At the same time, Rasmussen found that Donald Trump's approval rating was 43%.
[03:23:45.278 --> 03:23:48.120]  That's almost 20 points lower.
[03:23:48.120 --> 03:23:49.521]  And by the way, Trump was not alone.
[03:23:49.521 --> 03:23:53.324]  Black Lives Matter is far more popular than Joe Biden is, too.
[03:23:53.324 --> 03:23:56.046]  It's more popular than America's religious institutions.
[03:23:56.046 --> 03:23:56.987]  All of them.
[03:23:56.987 --> 03:23:59.909]  It's more popular than the media, the Congress, and big business.
[03:24:00.529 --> 03:24:06.374]  Black Matters is more popular by double digits than both the Democratic and the Republican parties.
[03:24:06.374 --> 03:24:08.155]  It's almost as popular as the U.S.
[03:24:08.155 --> 03:24:08.996]  military.
[03:24:08.996 --> 03:24:11.958]  It's much more popular than the Pope.
[03:24:11.958 --> 03:24:16.241]  The numbers are astounding, but the polls are not the only measure of it.
[03:24:16.241 --> 03:24:19.244]  Here's a Black Lives Matter rally from over the weekend in New York.
[03:24:20.029 --> 03:24:21.631]  Look at that picture.
[03:24:21.631 --> 03:24:24.154]  That is an ocean of people.
[03:24:24.154 --> 03:24:28.560]  Ask yourself the last time you saw a candidate for office who was able to draw a crowd like that.
[03:24:28.560 --> 03:24:35.468]  The media, in their relentlessly fawning coverage, usually describe Black Lives Matter as an activist group or a protest movement.
[03:24:36.089 --> 03:24:37.970]  But that's deception by understatement.
[03:24:37.970 --> 03:24:41.050]  Black Lives Matter is not a collection of marchers with signs.
[03:24:41.050 --> 03:24:44.911]  It's not a conventional political lobby like Planned Parenthood or the NRA.
[03:24:44.911 --> 03:24:48.572]  It's not pressuring Congress to pass some narrow new set of laws.
[03:24:48.572 --> 03:24:51.673]  Black Lives Matter is far more ambitious than that.
[03:24:51.673 --> 03:24:55.194]  It is working to remake the country and then to control it.
[03:24:55.194 --> 03:24:56.855]  It's a political party.
[03:24:56.855 --> 03:25:01.416]  As of tonight, Black Lives Matter may be the single most powerful political party in the United States.
[03:25:02.156 --> 03:25:05.619]  Nobody says that out loud, but politicians understand it perfectly well.
[03:25:05.619 --> 03:25:07.741]  If nothing else, they understand power.
[03:25:07.741 --> 03:25:09.723]  They can smell it at great distances.
[03:25:09.723 --> 03:25:13.947]  And that's why they're lining up to bow before Black Lives Matter.
[03:25:13.947 --> 03:25:20.674]  You can't really reform a department that is rotten to the root.
[03:25:20.674 --> 03:25:23.497]  We've heard our people cry out, I can't breathe.
[03:25:26.257 --> 03:25:27.899]  We've heard our people speak out.
[03:25:27.899 --> 03:25:31.284]  Black lives matter.
[03:25:31.284 --> 03:25:35.870]  This is a systemic problem that requires a comprehensive solution.
[03:25:35.870 --> 03:25:39.835]  What I would say is that there is a legitimacy to this anger.
[03:25:39.835 --> 03:25:41.478]  There's a legitimacy to this outrage.
[03:25:43.294 --> 03:25:45.975]  None of what you just saw is a stretch for Democrats.
[03:25:45.975 --> 03:25:50.018]  They believe their long-term goals align with those of Black Lives Matter.
[03:25:50.018 --> 03:25:53.499]  And in fact, at times, the group functions as an arm of the Democratic Party.
[03:25:53.499 --> 03:25:57.502]  More telling, though, and more ominous, is the response from many Republicans.
[03:25:57.502 --> 03:26:03.185]  They've been happy to go along as well, where in Mitt Romney's case, even mouthed the same slogans.
[03:26:03.185 --> 03:26:09.228]  A way to end violence and brutality, and to make sure that people understand that Black Lives Matter.
[03:26:11.394 --> 03:26:14.235]  That was the former Republican nominee for president.
[03:26:14.235 --> 03:26:15.675]  Let that sink in.
[03:26:15.675 --> 03:26:20.816]  If there was ever an indicator of how powerful Black Lives Matter has become, you just saw it.
[03:26:20.816 --> 03:26:27.138]  Republican leaders brag about their strong conservative convictions, but mostly they just want to be on the winning team, whatever that is.
[03:26:27.138 --> 03:26:29.338]  That's why they pause before offending China.
[03:26:29.338 --> 03:26:32.459]  It's why when Black Lives Matter tells them to take a knee, they do.
[03:26:33.609 --> 03:26:35.731]  It's all pretty strange when you think about it.
[03:26:35.731 --> 03:26:45.198]  If the leaders of Black Lives Matter are political actors, and they are, then by definition you are allowed to have any opinion you want to have about them.
[03:26:45.198 --> 03:26:50.181]  Black Lives Matter wants to run the country, therefore you can freely criticize Black Lives Matter.
[03:26:50.181 --> 03:26:52.043]  Those are the rules of our system.
[03:26:52.043 --> 03:26:53.564]  But not anymore.
[03:26:53.564 --> 03:26:58.828]  Imagine a world where you are punished for questioning the behavior of the president or for insulting your local mayor.
[03:26:59.508 --> 03:27:00.850]  You probably can't imagine that.
[03:27:00.850 --> 03:27:02.191]  It's too bizarre.
[03:27:02.191 --> 03:27:03.373]  It's un-American.
[03:27:03.373 --> 03:27:04.935]  But that's where we are right now.
[03:27:04.935 --> 03:27:07.018]  Black Lives Matter has changed the rules.
[03:27:07.018 --> 03:27:09.080]  And here's their first new rule.
[03:27:09.080 --> 03:27:11.423]  No criticizing Black Lives Matter.
[03:27:11.423 --> 03:27:14.307]  You can be fired from your job if you disobey.
[03:27:14.307 --> 03:27:15.408]  Many Americans have been.
[03:27:16.169 --> 03:27:30.417]  On Friday, for example, the principal of a public school in Windsor, Vermont, was dismissed from her job for posting the following words on her personal Facebook page, quote, While I understand the urgency to feel compelled to advocate for black lives, what about our fellow law enforcement?
[03:27:30.417 --> 03:27:36.420]  Just because I don't walk around with a BLM sign should not mean I'm a racist, end quote.
[03:27:36.420 --> 03:27:38.742]  Unfortunately, the principal's boss disagreed.
[03:27:38.742 --> 03:27:43.985]  The superintendent of Windsor schools described the quote you just heard as, quote, outright racist.
[03:27:44.645 --> 03:27:48.246]  Windsor, Vermont, by the way, is more than 97% white.
[03:27:48.246 --> 03:27:56.949]  Also on Friday, an economist called Harold Eulig lost his job at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for daring to offer even milder criticism than that.
[03:27:56.949 --> 03:28:04.871]  On Twitter, Eulig noted that Black Lives Matter had, quote, just torpedoed itself with its full-fledged support of hashtag defund the police.
[03:28:04.871 --> 03:28:12.854]  Now is the time, Eulig noted, quote, for sensible adults to enter back into the room and have serious, earnest, respectful conversations about it all.
[03:28:15.382 --> 03:28:20.845]  Meanwhile, the polls show support for Black Lives Matter over 60% amongst Americans.
[03:28:20.845 --> 03:28:24.546]  Of course, according to the most generous polls, Trump is hovering around 40%.
[03:28:24.546 --> 03:28:27.327]  Are they blind?
[03:28:27.327 --> 03:28:29.168]  They cave to the mob?
[03:28:29.168 --> 03:28:32.710]  Well, it's a bit of both, but where's the money gone is another question.
[03:28:33.823 --> 03:28:41.549]  Headline out of Newsweek, Minnesota Freedom Fund reveals only $200,000 of millions in donations has been spent to bail out protesters.
[03:28:41.549 --> 03:28:54.780]  Remember the campaign from the celebrities, many of which donated their own money, to bail out the protesters, the rioters, the criminal rioters, who are locked up and should have remained locked up for a very long time.
[03:28:54.780 --> 03:28:56.101]  They raised $35 million
[03:28:59.167 --> 03:29:00.908]  To bail out these rioters.
[03:29:00.908 --> 03:29:06.190]  They've only spent $200,000 of it actually bailing people out.
[03:29:06.190 --> 03:29:07.991]  Where's the money gone?
[03:29:07.991 --> 03:29:10.252]  Joe Biden's campaign, surely.
[03:29:10.252 --> 03:29:19.796]  The Minnesota Freedom Fund faced social media backlash after it revealed on Twitter it spent around $200,000 to bail out protesters, despite receiving millions in donations in recent weeks.
[03:29:19.796 --> 03:29:21.857]  So, nobody knows where that money's gone.
[03:29:21.857 --> 03:29:25.099]  Meanwhile, Bill de Blasio in New York is having
[03:29:25.916 --> 03:29:29.677]  The gates of parks and Jewish areas welded shut.
[03:29:29.677 --> 03:29:40.142]  Meanwhile, advocating Black Trans Lives Matter protesters in New York, gathered, occupied, attended by tens of thousands of people.
[03:29:40.142 --> 03:29:47.404]  This is after New York City told COVID contact tracers not to ask people if they attended BLM protests.
[03:29:47.404 --> 03:29:48.705]  They're literally telling the
[03:29:49.577 --> 03:29:59.707]  People tasked with doing this contact tracing for potential coronavirus infectees, don't ask them if they attended a Black Lives Matter protest.
[03:29:59.707 --> 03:30:02.730]  Why don't they want that information to be in the record?
[03:30:02.730 --> 03:30:05.593]  Because if there is a second wave of COVID-19,
[03:30:06.909 --> 03:30:17.673]  If it's because of these mass gatherings which people like Bill de Blasio have advocated and openly supported, then they can avoid blame because that information is not going to be in the system.
[03:30:17.673 --> 03:30:20.714]  Blatant, blatant cover-up.
[03:30:20.714 --> 03:30:28.216]  Meanwhile in the UK on the same issue, thousands signed petition to close Bicester Village over Covid-19 concerns.
[03:30:28.216 --> 03:30:36.319]  So we had the same thing, we had the Mayor of London, we had all these officials advocating the mass gathering of tens of thousands of people in central London.
[03:30:37.020 --> 03:30:52.212]  The same people are now angrily signing a petition to close a small shopping village in the UK because they were offended because people were too close to each other and not practicing proper social distancing.
[03:30:52.212 --> 03:31:02.920]  You've literally just advocated tens of thousands of people gathering in major cities and now you're upset about a few hundred people standing too close together outside a shop.
[03:31:03.504 --> 03:31:06.606]  Completely absurd and ridiculous.
[03:31:06.606 --> 03:31:07.567]  Don't go away.
[03:31:07.567 --> 03:31:09.728]  We'll be right back.
[03:31:09.728 --> 03:31:13.771]  Aerodyne Technology Delivery System.
[03:31:13.771 --> 03:31:15.352]  The first of its kind.
[03:31:15.352 --> 03:31:20.315]  Pure, nascent, atomic iodine that can be delivered through a spray bottle.
[03:31:20.315 --> 03:31:23.317]  The next level of innovation of X2 is here.
[03:31:23.317 --> 03:31:26.419]  Introducing Survival Shield X2 Spray.
[03:31:26.419 --> 03:31:29.521]  The great part about the X2 Spray is it's great on the go.
[03:31:29.521 --> 03:31:32.023]  When you've got it in the dropper, it's great at your house.
[03:31:32.563 --> 03:31:43.028]  You know, great at work, but this is great for the car, it's great to keep with you, and again, it's also good for the throat and mouth to get the effects of iodine, not to just ingest it into the stomach.
[03:31:43.028 --> 03:31:44.609]  We're really excited about it.
[03:31:44.609 --> 03:31:46.770]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[03:31:46.770 --> 03:31:58.255]  It was a listener's idea asking for us to come up with a spray bottle that had us talk to the scientists and developers and come up with a system that aerosolizes it and delivers it to the body in a new, and in some ways, even better way.
[03:31:58.735 --> 03:32:09.845]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine Spray now at 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com and experience the power of aerosolized X2 Nascent Iodine for yourself.
[03:32:09.845 --> 03:32:20.655]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run.
[03:32:22.016 --> 03:32:29.119]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards, they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins.
[03:32:29.119 --> 03:32:35.122]  But all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over, and they die.
[03:32:35.122 --> 03:32:37.323]  Then you go back them and haul them back in.
[03:32:38.183 --> 03:32:41.706]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[03:32:41.706 --> 03:32:47.572]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[03:32:47.572 --> 03:32:52.657]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[03:32:52.657 --> 03:32:56.881]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[03:32:57.441 --> 03:33:02.222]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[03:33:02.222 --> 03:33:11.685]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[03:33:11.685 --> 03:33:13.466]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[03:33:13.466 --> 03:33:14.486]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:33:14.486 --> 03:33:15.546]  Hello, can you hear me?
[03:33:15.546 --> 03:33:16.627]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[03:33:16.627 --> 03:33:23.469]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[03:33:23.469 --> 03:33:24.989]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:33:24.989 --> 03:33:26.850]  I'm calling from New Brink, Connecticut, and
[03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:28.951]  I just want to plug in.
[03:33:28.951 --> 03:33:33.375]  I'm a truck driver and Turbo Force has changed the way I drive.
[03:33:33.375 --> 03:33:40.000]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:48.046]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[03:33:48.766 --> 03:33:54.409]  Well brother we put more in this than any other long-term high-quality energy powder there is.
[03:33:54.409 --> 03:33:56.691]  So this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country.
[03:33:56.691 --> 03:34:10.158]  He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your truck drivers we love you.
[03:34:10.754 --> 03:34:13.118]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[03:34:13.118 --> 03:34:19.107]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[03:34:19.107 --> 03:34:23.053]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[03:34:24.201 --> 03:34:25.842]  That is amazing.
[03:34:25.842 --> 03:34:33.505]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[03:34:33.505 --> 03:34:35.846]  And there's another innovation.
[03:34:35.846 --> 03:34:37.926]  It's the spray cap.
[03:34:37.926 --> 03:34:43.349]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[03:34:43.349 --> 03:34:45.509]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[03:34:45.509 --> 03:34:46.430]  I like to put it on my hands.
[03:34:47.170 --> 03:34:48.670]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[03:34:48.670 --> 03:34:51.491]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[03:34:51.491 --> 03:34:53.071]  But I just love it.
[03:34:53.071 --> 03:34:55.892]  Personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[03:34:55.892 --> 03:34:57.672]  So, this is a real innovation.
[03:34:57.672 --> 03:35:04.214]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[03:35:04.214 --> 03:35:05.554]  Smells great.
[03:35:05.554 --> 03:35:07.375]  It's so refreshing.
[03:35:07.375 --> 03:35:08.255]  This is a big winner.
[03:35:13.800 --> 03:35:26.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:26.554 --> 03:35:35.283]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:35:37.651 --> 03:35:39.332]  Go live in the final segment.
[03:35:39.332 --> 03:35:42.194]  Gonna hit some final news stories here in a second.

[03:36:20.012 --> 03:36:22.033]  Who could have seen that coming?
[03:36:22.033 --> 03:36:25.154]  Also got the limited edition InfoWars face mask.

[03:36:41.984 --> 03:36:48.170]  Headline up on Summit News, Rick Wilson humiliated after trying to politicize eight-year-old Domino's pizza tweet.
[03:36:49.065 --> 03:36:51.807]  Yes, this is THE Rick Wilson.
[03:36:51.807 --> 03:36:53.849]  Neocon Never Trumper.
[03:36:53.849 --> 03:36:58.673]  The guy who literally wished that Melania Trump would be infected with coronavirus.
[03:36:58.673 --> 03:37:00.874]  He's a pleasant individual.
[03:37:00.874 --> 03:37:05.058]  Absolutely humiliated and owned by a pizza company.
[03:37:05.058 --> 03:37:06.879]  This is absolutely hilarious.
[03:37:06.879 --> 03:37:08.641]  Neocon Never Trumper.
[03:37:08.641 --> 03:37:10.082]  Rick Wilson was humiliated.
[03:37:11.144 --> 03:37:22.166]  After he attempted to politicise a thank you tweet sent by Domino's Pizza to White House Press Secretary Hayley McEnany, apparently not realising the tweet was eight years old.
[03:37:22.166 --> 03:37:33.489]  Now even if the tweet wasn't eight years old, how much of a tribalist hack do you need to be to get angry and try to whip up the outrage hate mob against somebody
[03:37:34.102 --> 03:37:36.723]  Because they said, I like your pizza.
[03:37:36.723 --> 03:37:42.845]  Literally anything they will try and pick up and whip up a contrived outrage over.
[03:37:42.845 --> 03:37:58.290]  Wilson, who is billed as a Republican strategist, yet constantly amplifies left-wing rhetoric, he's one of these Republican Uncle Toms who gets to sit on the peanut gallery on CNN and they pat him on the head as he says, Orange Man bad every night.
[03:37:58.290 --> 03:38:02.351]  Which is why his Twitter following, by the way, is full of far-left resistance members.
[03:38:03.948 --> 03:38:13.034]  Was responding to an exchange between McEnany and Domino's in which McEnany tweeted, This prompted Wilson to wade in and attempt to politicize the interaction by tweeting at Domino's, He literally tried to cancel Domino's pizza over a tweet.
[03:38:13.034 --> 03:38:13.334]  Problem is,
[03:38:31.644 --> 03:38:44.508]  He didn't appear to realise that the original exchange between McEnany and Domino's took place in 2012, eight years ago, long before Donald Trump was even President.
[03:38:44.508 --> 03:38:55.372]  And then what made it even more succulent was Domino's Pizza came in, which to be fair is brave of them, given the current state of corporate virtue signalling in America.
[03:38:56.454 --> 03:39:05.496]  And they compounded the humiliation by responding to Wilson, Well, it's unfortunate that thanking a customer for a compliment back in 2012 would be viewed as political.
[03:39:05.496 --> 03:39:08.696]  Guess that's 2020 for you.
[03:39:08.696 --> 03:39:23.019]  So they literally sent a tweet in response to the current White House Press Secretary when she was in college eight years ago and this idiot for some reason got confused and thought it was a modern tweet and tried to cancel
[03:39:23.976 --> 03:39:29.498]  Domino's Pizza, because they responded to her saying, thank you, I liked your pizza.
[03:39:29.498 --> 03:39:34.200]  How much of a tribalist hack do you need to be to engage in that kind of behavior?
[03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:39.122]  Even if it was a 2020 tweet, the same rules would apply.
[03:39:39.122 --> 03:39:44.065]  But because it was eight years old, he got absolutely humiliated on top of it.
[03:39:44.065 --> 03:39:49.527]  And Newsbusters reports, this isn't the first major gaffe Wilson committed in his ongoing Twitter war with the President.
[03:39:50.586 --> 03:40:00.314]  Wilson made a sorry attempt to play gotcha over the coronavirus-induced market dip March 9th by sharing a tweet the same day that appeared to be from Trump in 2015.
[03:40:00.314 --> 03:40:08.660]  The tweet he shared called for the punishment of a sitting president if the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 1,000 points in a single day.
[03:40:08.660 --> 03:40:10.642]  The tweet called it the Dow Jones.
[03:40:10.642 --> 03:40:12.944]  J-O-A-N-S.
[03:40:12.944 --> 03:40:15.006]  Wilson commented, I agree, Mr. President.
[03:40:15.006 --> 03:40:15.426]  The problem?
[03:40:16.627 --> 03:40:20.009]  Wilson agreed with a fact-checked fake tweet.
[03:40:20.009 --> 03:40:30.315]  And just as in this case, when he got probably thousands of thousands of retweets for a completely fraudulent fake tweet, there's no retraction whatsoever.
[03:40:30.315 --> 03:40:33.037]  They only ever double down.
[03:40:33.037 --> 03:40:35.398]  This happens all the time.
[03:40:35.398 --> 03:40:40.221]  Last week, somebody on Twitter claimed that President Trump had personally DM'd him.
[03:40:41.115 --> 03:40:47.178]  And then when the response wasn't likeable to President Trump, he blocked the person.
[03:40:47.178 --> 03:40:48.259]  Completely fake.
[03:40:48.259 --> 03:40:59.445]  And this idiot got up on Twitter and tried to legitimately claim that President Trump had personally DM'd just him to try and enlist his support, and then blocked him.
[03:40:59.445 --> 03:41:03.307]  And it literally got like 200,000 likes.
[03:41:03.307 --> 03:41:04.827]  Completely fake.
[03:41:04.827 --> 03:41:06.988]  Where's the Twitter fact check on that?
[03:41:06.988 --> 03:41:07.849]  Non-existent.
[03:41:09.713 --> 03:41:12.394]  I remind you that we had this headline out of Fox News Frequency.
[03:41:12.394 --> 03:41:18.236]  CNN guest Rick Wilson mocks Melania Trump to quote, hashtag be infected with coronavirus.
[03:41:18.236 --> 03:41:22.938]  He's a very pleasant individual and he's being completely humiliated today.
[03:41:22.938 --> 03:41:25.239]  Couldn't have happened to a better person.
[03:41:25.239 --> 03:41:28.600]  Meanwhile, coronavirus is back!
[03:41:28.600 --> 03:41:29.000]  Great!
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:30.100]  Just what we needed.
[03:41:30.100 --> 03:41:34.402]  Chinese capital and provinces imposed travel curbs as coronavirus cases mount.
[03:41:35.484 --> 03:41:47.414]  Chinese capital of Beijing banned high-risk people from leaving and curbed public transport on Tuesday to stop the spread of the most serious coronavirus flare-up since February, which has stoked fears of a second wave of infections.
[03:41:47.414 --> 03:41:58.463]  Shanghai demanded some travellers from Beijing be quarantined for two weeks as 27 new COVID-19 cases took the capital's current outbreak to 106 since Thursday.
[03:41:58.463 --> 03:42:03.668]  So they've banned people travelling, they're starting to shut down some of the airports,
[03:42:04.269 --> 03:42:06.530]  They're starting to shut down some of the schools.
[03:42:06.530 --> 03:42:08.410]  And guess where the virus came from?
[03:42:08.410 --> 03:42:10.631]  Oh, it came from another seafood market.
[03:42:10.631 --> 03:42:15.192]  The same ones that you're not allowed to criticise because that's racist.
[03:42:15.192 --> 03:42:18.814]  You're not allowed to call it the Wuhan virus, even though it came from Wuhan, that's racist.
[03:42:18.814 --> 03:42:20.814]  The exact same thing has happened again.
[03:42:20.814 --> 03:42:22.715]  They've got another outbreak.
[03:42:22.715 --> 03:42:26.396]  If this gets any worse, if they don't get it under control very swiftly,
[03:42:27.398 --> 03:42:37.245]  We need to block all incoming flights coming into the United States and the UK and every other Western country from China and it needs to happen soon.
[03:42:37.245 --> 03:42:43.650]  There is no way the economy can withstand yet another bout of this situation.
[03:42:43.650 --> 03:42:48.774]  Whether you believe coronavirus was exaggerated or not, you know what they're going to do if there's a second wave.
[03:42:48.774 --> 03:42:51.396]  They're going to try and lock down everything again and of course that is
[03:42:52.108 --> 03:42:58.152]  Drastically harmful, not just in terms of the economy, but in terms of people's lives.
[03:42:58.152 --> 03:43:08.259]  In the UK, we've already had predicted 50,000 excess cancer deaths because people can't get treatment in hospitals because they devoted them all to Covid.
[03:43:08.259 --> 03:43:11.781]  Of course, the hospitals ended up being half empty.
[03:43:11.781 --> 03:43:14.984]  The nurses ended up dancing around in TikTok videos.
[03:43:14.984 --> 03:43:16.725]  They'll probably roll that out again.
[03:43:17.498 --> 03:43:32.726]  While allowing people to travel all over the world because the free movement of people is vastly more important than saving lives, vastly more important than preserving the economy, because globalism uber-alias.
[03:43:32.726 --> 03:43:40.610]  Meanwhile, NBC News reports, Google bans two websites from its ad platform over protest articles.
[03:43:42.888 --> 03:43:51.089]  The Federalist and Zero Hedge will no longer be able to generate revenue from any advertisement served by Google Ads.
[03:43:51.089 --> 03:43:51.710]  Why?
[03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:53.630]  Because of the content of their websites.
[03:43:53.630 --> 03:43:56.150]  Again, this is financially punishing people.
[03:43:56.150 --> 03:44:07.752]  This is an attack on NBC News' competition for one, and all these other little tattletales who probably created the wave which led to this deplatforming, of course.
[03:44:07.752 --> 03:44:11.933]  A few days ago, surprisingly, Zero Hedge got back on Twitter.
[03:44:12.648 --> 03:44:19.312]  That's one of the unprecedented few examples where they actually admitted that banning them was a mistake and allowed them back on.
[03:44:19.312 --> 03:44:22.954]  But now Google has banned two far-right websites.
[03:44:22.954 --> 03:44:26.896]  Like, the Federalist is literally like a libertarian conservative website.
[03:44:26.896 --> 03:44:29.877]  It's hardly the Daily Stormer, is it?
[03:44:29.877 --> 03:44:34.240]  From its advertising platform, after research revealed the tech giant was profiting,
[03:44:35.413 --> 03:44:40.355]  From articles pushing unsubstantiated claims about Black Lives Matter protests.
[03:44:40.355 --> 03:44:48.278]  Unsubstantiated claims means telling the truth about the fact that it's violent, anarchistic and out of control.
[03:44:48.278 --> 03:44:50.159]  That's what they mean by that.
[03:44:50.159 --> 03:44:55.201]  Oh, by the way, guess whose articles Zero Hedge carries on a daily basis, multiple times a day?
[03:44:55.201 --> 03:44:56.561]  Yours truly.
[03:44:56.561 --> 03:45:03.924]  The two sites, Zero Hedge and The Federalist, will no longer be able to generate revenue from any advertisements served by Google Ads.
[03:45:04.707 --> 03:45:11.649]  Google spokesperson said in an email it took action after determining the website violated its policies on content related to race.
[03:45:11.649 --> 03:45:13.389]  You know what that content is?
[03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:18.950]  It's saying that 50% of violent crimes are committed by 13% of the population.
[03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:21.511]  Those kind of hate facts are not allowed.
[03:45:21.511 --> 03:45:27.052]  Of course, InfoWars was completely banned by Google Ads, what, nearly two years ago now?
[03:45:27.868 --> 03:45:31.570]  Others are now on the receiving end of that financial punishment.
[03:45:31.570 --> 03:45:34.051]  It's about strangling competition.
[03:45:34.051 --> 03:45:37.833]  It's about top-down Silicon Valley censorship.
[03:45:37.833 --> 03:45:40.174]  They broke their own search engine.
[03:45:40.174 --> 03:45:43.675]  They broke YouTube's search engine to de-platform people.
[03:45:43.675 --> 03:45:47.377]  So it's no surprise that they're now de-platforming people financially.
[03:45:48.604 --> 03:45:49.847]  It's gonna wrap it up for now.
[03:45:49.847 --> 03:45:51.631]  Coming up next is The War Room.
[03:45:51.631 --> 03:45:52.734]  That's gonna wrap it up for me though.
