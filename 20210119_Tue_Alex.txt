[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  It is projected to reach 11 billion by the end of the century, feeding that many people
[00:16.000 --> 00:23.000]  will be a challenge, and it is further complicated by the impact of climate change on agriculture.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  That is why some people advocate an unusual way to boost the food supply and feed people
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  sustainably by eating less meat and more insects.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  We have to prepare for a more angry world and how to prepare.
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  It means to take the necessary action to create the fair world.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  The global government reset wanting to make you poor, wanting to make you sick,
[00:46.000 --> 00:48.000]  wanting to make you dead is out in the open.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  And we're going to fight back, not with deadly poison vaccines, not with Kim Trails,
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  not with pedophilia, not with all the aggressive new world order that the globalist attack us with,
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  but with love and justice and freedom and boycotts and civil disobedience and promoting the truth and free speech.
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  Gatti exposes Twitter's plans to scale the censorship that we are currently experiencing here in the U.S. globally.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  Gatti says they're doing this because of the violence that has unfolded as a result of, quote,
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  either misleading information or coded rhetoric.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  We wonder which leaders will we band next?
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  I have a question that we saw was just around the global application of this and how we can ensure the consistency of the appeal.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  Just what's happening in the U.S. right now.
[01:30.000 --> 01:39.000]  Yeah, Ashley, one of the interesting things is a lot of the work that we've been doing over the last week is work that we've built on
[01:39.000 --> 01:49.000]  in other places around the world where we've seen violence unfold as a result of either misleading information or coded rhetoric.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  So a lot of our learnings here have come from other markets.
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  So in that sense, you know, we do feel like it is, this is our global approach.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  We need to be very focused on being able to enforce any of these policies or enforcement decisions we make at scale.
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  So they had hundreds of thousands of people there.
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  Trump said go to the Capitol, be peaceful.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  None of the media shows you that.
[02:11.000 --> 02:21.000]  I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.000]  Hundreds of thousands came to the Capitol.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  They're there.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  Antio was already there in the morning before Trump even spoke, starting a fight.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  Trump's a mile and a half away.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  They begin to attack.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  And then the Boogaloo's, which again are quote right wing, but they're against the Proud Boys and they want a civil war.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  This is the Boogaloo Boys, the guys behind me, myself, we're out here supporting the local BLM scene and the Boogaloo Boys.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  And we're probably going to piss off a bunch of Trumpers today, but it's easy to piss them off though.
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  Posing as them, they then come and attack and hand out weapons and knock the few cops down that had been had their numbers cut that day.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  They've been told to be on traffic control around the city.
[03:00.000 --> 03:08.000]  And then the crowd of hundreds of thousands doesn't know what's going on, but we have all the videos of patriots beating up Antifa and Boogaloo's, not letting them get in.
[03:08.000 --> 03:09.000]  But it didn't matter.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  Once the doors were open, the people went in a few hundred.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  They followed the velvet ropes.
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  Here is the goofy guy, you know, with the bison horns on his head that was nonviolent.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  Maybe he gets a trespassing ticket, 500 bucks.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.000]  Maybe he does a week of community service.
[03:26.000 --> 03:27.000]  No, he's still in jail.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  Last time I heard he's charged with all sorts of evil.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  Here he is walking into the Senate.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  F***ing A, man.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  Glad to see you guys.
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  You guys are f***ing patriots.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  Look at this guy.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  He's got covered in blood.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  God bless you.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  Yes.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  You good, sir?
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  Do you need medical attention?
[03:43.000 --> 03:44.000]  I'm good.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  Thank you.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  You alright?
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  I got shot in the face.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic mullet.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate?
[03:55.000 --> 03:57.000]  Wait, wait, wait.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  I may not be sure that interest is back in the place.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  Okay.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  I just want to let you guys know this is like the sacredest place.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  It's sacred.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  And so, because it's the will of the people, right?
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  And a few minutes later, another desert shall show up, but the one cop is able to get him to leave.
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  So, you just saw the most deadly attack in U.S. history.
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  You just saw something bigger than the Trojan War, bigger than World War II, bigger than
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  the Civil War, you just saw what America has to end.
[04:25.000 --> 04:54.000]  Okay.
[04:55.000 --> 05:02.000]  Thank you.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  Q is a Bolshevik operation.
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  Q is a relaunch of operation trust that the Soviets used in the 1920s to identify who their
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.000]  opposition was.
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  That's when George Arwell wrote 1984 that was about a futuristic, Stalinistic world
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  government system.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  He talked about Emmanuel Goldstein, who was the supposed leader of the resistance, but
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  really worked for the controllers to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  That's what's happening.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  So, the storm of Q is real.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  It's a globalist martial law takeover of America.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but you have been had.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on, but did not realize it was the main thrust.
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  The main thrust, the globalist takeover, is Operation Trust 2.0.
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  We're covering it all live on the air at m4wars.com and newswars.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.000]  We'll have reporters on the ground covering the inauguration of the Communist Chinese spy
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  bite.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  The globalists are planning false flags.
[05:57.000 --> 06:23.000]  We pray we can stop them.
[06:28.000 --> 06:39.000]  We are now exactly 24 hours out from the globalist, shy com, new world order, pedophile agent,
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  Joe Biden, after stealing the election, being installed as a 46th president of the United
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.000]  States.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.400]  And the globalists are going to come after us in ways you have never even imagined they
[06:50.400 --> 06:56.840]  are going to indent the population, shut down all the major infrastructures, and consolidate
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.840]  power.
[06:57.840 --> 07:01.840]  If you think in the last year with the whole COVID martial law hoax, big tech doubling its
[07:01.840 --> 07:07.640]  money and the big banks doubling their profits, if you think that was bad, just wait until
[07:07.640 --> 07:11.040]  you see what is coming next.
[07:11.040 --> 07:17.480]  Now, this is a report that the great Harrison Smith put together two and a half years ago
[07:17.480 --> 07:21.320]  that is more pertinent now than it was back then, and then I'm going to go over all the
[07:21.320 --> 07:25.080]  latest news and developments and what is about to unfold.
[07:25.080 --> 07:29.320]  These titles, this is why they banned Alex Jones, we're going to play it in a moment.
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.320]  This was all in one rant, in one segment.
[07:33.320 --> 07:36.800]  Basically unedited, he just added documents and videos to it.
[07:36.800 --> 07:42.160]  And you can see when I lay out this brainstorm that that's where we are today and how they
[07:42.160 --> 07:47.200]  are training us and maneuvering us for total tyranny.
[07:47.200 --> 07:51.680]  They were just on Fox News announcing that now big tech is going to ban more presidents
[07:51.680 --> 07:57.000]  and prime ministers from the Internet, and that only the UN is allowed to speak and only
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.280]  major corporations.
[07:58.280 --> 08:04.160]  This is a planetary takeover, and now the UN is out saying they need hundreds of billions
[08:04.160 --> 08:12.080]  of dollars right now to feed the billions that are on the verge of starvation that millions
[08:12.080 --> 08:19.440]  have already died because of the COVID lockdown and that the third world is now collapsing
[08:19.440 --> 08:23.200]  and they are the ones that engineered this with the communist Chinese and the Bill and
[08:23.200 --> 08:24.880]  Melinda Gates Foundation on record.
[08:24.880 --> 08:31.120]  It's called Operation Lockstep, and the whole rollout of the global ID and the vaccine travel
[08:31.120 --> 08:35.520]  passports and all of this is designed by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[08:35.520 --> 08:41.680]  That was in the New York Times this week, I told you this a year ago, but there they
[08:41.680 --> 08:44.320]  are running our lives.
[08:44.320 --> 08:45.320]  It's unbelievable.
[08:45.320 --> 08:50.760]  Meanwhile, John Hopkins has come out, it's actually run by the Gates operation, and admitted
[08:50.760 --> 08:56.920]  that the lockdown is killing more people than it saves, and admitting that we're going into
[08:56.920 --> 09:01.080]  a global economic depression.
[09:01.080 --> 09:03.760]  So out of one side of their mouth in the fine print, they admit what they're doing, but
[09:03.760 --> 09:05.160]  then they continue it.
[09:05.160 --> 09:09.120]  This is murderous modern warfare all laid out.
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.040]  Claus Schwab set this four years ago.
[09:13.040 --> 09:16.920]  I remember reading 15 years ago about Agenda 21, 20 years ago.
[09:16.920 --> 09:22.720]  They rolled it out back in 1992 at Rio de Janeiro, but I remember people really got into it.
[09:22.720 --> 09:28.120]  25 years ago, I had Dr. Michael Kaufman on, rest his soul, great professor and patriot,
[09:28.120 --> 09:34.520]  and he would lay out all of the plans to have transgenders and break up the family and take
[09:34.520 --> 09:41.000]  us off the land and make us obsolete and put us in 200 square foot apartments and how they
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.240]  would use disease, the threat of disease, to have forced inoculations and how they were
[09:45.240 --> 09:49.720]  going to collapse the borders and bring in world government because of the crisis, because
[09:49.720 --> 09:52.960]  they admit all of this.
[09:52.960 --> 09:55.000]  He just brought the documents to my attention.
[09:55.000 --> 10:02.960]  The UN is public about all of this, so don't live in denial.
[10:02.960 --> 10:08.000]  You are under assault, and it's all about you thinking the people that are attacking are
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  actually your friends.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.520]  If you launch the attacks, they get rich, they consolidate power, and you get totally
[10:13.520 --> 10:14.520]  enslaved.
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.880]  So we're going to air this report, and then I'm going to come back and lay out the cold
[10:19.880 --> 10:20.880]  heart facts.
[10:20.880 --> 10:21.880]  Trump's going to leave tomorrow.
[10:21.880 --> 10:24.400]  You're going to see him leave.
[10:24.400 --> 10:25.640]  There's not mass arrests happening.
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.240]  If there's any mass arrests, it'll be a patriot once Biden's in.
[10:30.240 --> 10:37.240]  This whole thing was a giant setup, a pacification operation, Operation Trust 2.0, and I have
[10:37.240 --> 10:41.600]  a lot of people mad at me, but you won't be mad tomorrow when you see that I told you
[10:41.600 --> 10:42.600]  the truth.
[10:42.600 --> 10:43.600]  You'll be very, very sad.
[10:43.600 --> 10:48.520]  We had a poll on infowars.com over the weekend with tens of thousands of people that clicked
[10:48.520 --> 10:49.520]  on it.
[10:49.520 --> 10:50.520]  I don't know if we ever had a chance to pull that up.
[10:50.520 --> 10:55.040]  We should have an article about it where we can repost it and have people voting in,
[10:55.040 --> 11:00.800]  and over 45% thought that everyone's being mass arrested and Trump's going to stay in
[11:00.800 --> 11:01.800]  office.
[11:01.800 --> 11:06.760]  Absolutely incredible that, you know, 27% thought Biden will get in but then be removed
[11:06.760 --> 11:11.120]  or this percent thought that, but 40 plus percent, 45 plus percent of tens of thousands
[11:11.120 --> 11:19.680]  of people that voted believe that Trump is going to be still there in office.
[11:19.680 --> 11:22.240]  It's not true.
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.760]  And the election was stolen and they are putting a chica image in that no one likes.
[11:26.760 --> 11:27.760]  It's totally unpopular.
[11:27.760 --> 11:32.920]  They're having hundreds of thousands of flags put up to represent people and his full inauguration.
[11:32.920 --> 11:34.320]  Everything's virtual now.
[11:34.320 --> 11:36.840]  This is the mass gaslighting.
[11:36.840 --> 11:45.360]  So we're going to have to wake up to the facts and just realize that we have to dig in now
[11:45.360 --> 11:50.320]  and fight the globalist because we're going under agenda 20, 30.
[11:50.320 --> 11:53.720]  We're going under the Great Reset and the enemy just thinks we're idiots and they're
[11:53.720 --> 11:54.720]  just going to carry it out.
[11:54.720 --> 11:55.760]  This is a mass crime.
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.200]  We need our legislatures.
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.640]  We need our good Congress people.
[11:58.640 --> 11:59.640]  We need our pastors.
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.240]  We need our fathers and mothers and everybody to mobilize against this now while there is
[12:04.240 --> 12:05.760]  still time.
[12:05.760 --> 12:09.360]  It's only going to get worse the more we play along with each phase of it that rolls out
[12:09.360 --> 12:10.360]  its takeover.
[12:10.360 --> 12:11.360]  So here's the report.
[12:11.360 --> 12:13.360]  It's also posted at band.video.
[12:13.360 --> 12:16.440]  This is why they banned Alex Jones from two plus years ago.
[12:16.440 --> 12:20.560]  Transmissions from deep in the heart of Texas and U.S. resistance against a global corporate
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.840]  combine empowered and funded by communist China ally with the big mega banks that set
[12:24.840 --> 12:27.440]  up communist China in 1949.
[12:27.440 --> 12:31.760]  The communist Chinese have taken control of U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.
[12:31.760 --> 12:33.920]  The communist Chinese are taking control of Hollywood.
[12:33.920 --> 12:36.320]  The communist Chinese are taking control of the main universities.
[12:36.320 --> 12:37.320]  This is all confirmed.
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.520]  This is not a drill.
[12:38.520 --> 12:42.400]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the communist Chinese government.
[12:42.400 --> 12:44.360]  They've officially become state run.
[12:44.360 --> 12:49.640]  Apple 100 percent Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total
[12:49.640 --> 12:50.640]  worldwide censorship.
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.480]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man a demonized version of Alex Jones
[12:55.480 --> 12:56.480]  to do that.
[12:56.480 --> 12:57.480]  This is happening.
[12:57.480 --> 13:01.960]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship
[13:01.960 --> 13:05.680]  thinking you would adapt the censorship by just putting up with it now.
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.600]  This attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous
[13:10.600 --> 13:11.600]  attacks.
[13:11.600 --> 13:17.200]  This is a tight traded dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.200]  subversion paradigm manipulation in layman's terms.
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.200]  They are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[13:24.200 --> 13:27.720]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[13:27.720 --> 13:33.600]  Now when the mega ton hits us of the total takeover we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[13:33.600 --> 13:38.240]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[13:38.240 --> 13:42.360]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control
[13:42.360 --> 13:43.360]  system.
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.480]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders
[13:48.480 --> 13:53.280]  inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[13:53.280 --> 13:57.840]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai con slash big tech begging combine
[13:57.840 --> 13:58.840]  emergency situation.
[13:58.840 --> 14:02.600]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[14:02.600 --> 14:05.480]  battering ramming it out as much as I can.
[14:05.480 --> 14:11.360]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[14:11.360 --> 14:14.240]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.760]  So they take what I've said being sincere built me into an insincere person in the straw
[14:18.760 --> 14:19.760]  man.
[14:19.760 --> 14:22.560]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[14:22.560 --> 14:27.400]  And so they make me a herder of children and they build me into this lie to then set the
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.960]  distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[14:32.960 --> 14:38.160]  So even if I didn't sell out to them they now use me as an archetype to serve them by
[14:38.160 --> 14:39.960]  being the main distraction.
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.880]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum has being used
[14:44.880 --> 14:45.880]  against you.
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.480]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[14:50.480 --> 14:57.120]  I have given you the transmission now break free.
[14:57.120 --> 15:04.400]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[15:04.400 --> 15:06.000]  the mind of man.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.880]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.880]  All right I want to talk about the big issues when we come back and then specifically what's
[15:17.880 --> 15:21.960]  about to happen in the Capitol and the incredible reports and footage that our team on the ground
[15:21.960 --> 15:25.160]  there is getting.
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.840]  But being delusional and thinking that Donald Trump can save us is not going to happen.
[15:30.840 --> 15:33.760]  We got Trump elected despite their fraud.
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.480]  We have the populist movement worldwide and so many people that were kind of new to waking
[15:38.480 --> 15:44.240]  up are now about to have an incredibly rude awakening when Trump is gone tomorrow.
[15:44.240 --> 15:49.120]  And I suspect they will get even more delusional and think that Joe Biden is a hologram or
[15:49.120 --> 15:51.480]  something that Trump is still president.
[15:51.480 --> 15:52.480]  This has happened before.
[15:52.480 --> 16:10.480]  I am going to break it down when we come back.
[16:10.480 --> 16:27.760]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[16:27.760 --> 16:35.760]  But the new website is theresistence.video.
[16:35.760 --> 16:40.760]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[16:40.760 --> 16:45.760]  So the new URL that links right to Bandot Video, and all of our videos, and all of our documentaries,
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.760]  and all the special reports, and all the suppressed information, is at TheResistance.Video.
[16:50.760 --> 16:55.760]  Share the link. TheResistance.Video. TheResistance.Video.
[16:55.760 --> 16:58.760]  The best product. I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now.
[16:58.760 --> 17:00.760]  If you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[17:00.760 --> 17:03.760]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[17:03.760 --> 17:06.760]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[17:06.760 --> 17:10.760]  That was a crazy week. I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go,
[17:10.760 --> 17:13.760]  TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to
[17:13.760 --> 17:16.760]  taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[17:16.760 --> 17:19.760]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[17:19.760 --> 17:22.760]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[17:22.760 --> 17:24.760]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[17:24.760 --> 17:27.760]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day
[17:27.760 --> 17:30.760]  trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[17:30.760 --> 17:33.760]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[17:33.760 --> 17:35.760]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me.
[17:35.760 --> 17:36.760]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[17:36.760 --> 17:39.760]  Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[17:39.760 --> 17:42.760]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[17:42.760 --> 17:45.760]  I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[17:45.760 --> 17:48.760]  I want to take control of my health, and that's why I need to go to Infowars.com,
[17:48.760 --> 17:50.760]  take control of your health right now and support the Resistance.
[17:50.760 --> 17:53.760]  Don't buy into the group, think. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the TurboForce.
[17:53.760 --> 17:55.760]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[17:55.760 --> 17:58.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:13.760 --> 18:15.760]  Monday through Friday.
[18:15.760 --> 18:18.760]  From 8 a.m. in the morning until 6 p.m. in the evening,
[18:18.760 --> 18:22.760]  Infowars has live transmissions with Harrison Smith.
[18:22.760 --> 18:26.760]  There's truly Alex Jones. 11 to 3.
[18:26.760 --> 18:29.760]  Owen Schreuer. 3 to 6.
[18:29.760 --> 18:33.760]  And we are going to add some more broadcasts and more shows, hopefully, in the future.
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.760]  But right now, we are just dealing with the martial law globalist takeover.
[18:38.760 --> 18:40.760]  Who knows that we'll be here soon?
[18:40.760 --> 18:45.760]  I mean, it's that bad when there are censoring presidents and prime ministers around the world,
[18:45.760 --> 18:49.760]  when Big Tech is spying on everyone, when the U.N. is in control.
[18:49.760 --> 18:53.760]  I mean, we're in world government. We've been hit by this attack,
[18:53.760 --> 18:56.760]  and we have to recognize that we've been hit by this attack
[18:56.760 --> 19:00.760]  and declare our independence against it and say we'll not submit to it.
[19:00.760 --> 19:05.760]  When I say 1776 versus 1984,
[19:05.760 --> 19:12.760]  I mean a culture of liberty and freedom worldwide versus this Orwellian 1984 system.
[19:12.760 --> 19:18.760]  I've seen the Boogaloo's that are, you know, pro-BLM and pro-revolution,
[19:18.760 --> 19:26.760]  pro-civil war say that, you know, well, Jones, you say 1776?
[19:26.760 --> 19:29.760]  Yes, and I've been very clear about what 1776 means.
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.760]  If you think ransacking the Capitol and acting like idiots and beating up some cops
[19:34.760 --> 19:39.760]  made us look good and advance the ball for freedom in this country and the world,
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.760]  well, then I can't even try to tell you which side is up.
[19:43.760 --> 19:45.760]  I mean, I can't help you.
[19:45.760 --> 19:49.760]  But we know the feds are leading these organizations and groups provocaturing them.
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.760]  Have you seen any arrest of the Boogaloo's
[19:54.760 --> 19:57.760]  when they're on Twitter and we're able to operate saying we're going to go
[19:57.760 --> 19:59.760]  and we're going to take over the Capitol?
[19:59.760 --> 20:01.760]  And then they went and they did it.
[20:01.760 --> 20:05.760]  And there are really a leftist group, the media calls right wing, that works with BLM.
[20:05.760 --> 20:08.760]  They go, oh, we're just for BLM's, you know, free speech and everything.
[20:08.760 --> 20:10.760]  Well, great, they got their free speech.
[20:10.760 --> 20:13.760]  They got $10.6 billion. George Soros created them.
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.760]  They're an arm of the Democratic Party.
[20:15.760 --> 20:17.760]  And now you're their paramilitary security.
[20:17.760 --> 20:19.760]  Wow, that's great. You're really the resistance.
[20:19.760 --> 20:22.760]  Yeah, you're really the rebellion.
[20:22.760 --> 20:25.760]  The rebellion against God and humanity and freedom.
[20:25.760 --> 20:27.760]  Accelerationist.
[20:27.760 --> 20:32.760]  Oh, we saw your accelerationism at the Capitol, didn't we?
[20:32.760 --> 20:36.760]  And it set us back light years.
[20:36.760 --> 20:39.760]  But you're the security for the Democratic Party's BLM.
[20:39.760 --> 20:44.760]  So, oh, and then when the governor, Whitmer, looks like she's having a problem at Michigan.
[20:44.760 --> 20:48.760]  Oh, you get some, you're wound up idiots to go out and try to kidnap her.
[20:48.760 --> 20:50.760]  So she can look like a hero.
[20:50.760 --> 20:56.760]  You're there to help the deep state run false flags, period.
[20:56.760 --> 20:59.760]  I'm done talking about that.
[20:59.760 --> 21:02.760]  You notice they arrested and Ray Kataria, who's a good guy.
[21:02.760 --> 21:07.760]  You notice there, you know, set the FBI out for Joe Biggs, all the rest of the stuff going on.
[21:07.760 --> 21:09.760]  Because they didn't do anything.
[21:09.760 --> 21:11.760]  Because they're innocent.
[21:11.760 --> 21:14.760]  I'll guarantee you the FBI runs Antifa.
[21:14.760 --> 21:17.760]  And I guarantee you that's why they say that they don't exist.
[21:17.760 --> 21:18.760]  Antifa doesn't exist.
[21:18.760 --> 21:25.760]  And that's why they first said through a false statement that they were attracted to the Proud Boys or a terrorist group.
[21:25.760 --> 21:30.760]  Because anybody that stands up for this country legitimately against the CHICOM takeover is shut down.
[21:30.760 --> 21:35.760]  Those that serve the system are protected and defended.
[21:35.760 --> 21:37.760]  So we are the resistance to the New World Order.
[21:37.760 --> 21:38.760]  We are the rebels.
[21:38.760 --> 21:40.760]  We are 1776.
[21:40.760 --> 21:41.760]  We're against the shutdowns.
[21:41.760 --> 21:42.760]  We're against the lockdowns.
[21:42.760 --> 21:44.760]  We're against the gun confiscation.
[21:44.760 --> 21:49.760]  We're against the pedophile rings that have all been exposed by Trump and by us.
[21:49.760 --> 21:52.760]  Jeffrey Epstein, the rest of it.
[21:52.760 --> 21:53.760]  Who we got coming on today?
[21:53.760 --> 22:02.760]  James Sullivan, brother of John Sullivan, the Antifa ringleader that said he was going to bring 100 Antifa to D.C. to overthrow the Capitol.
[22:02.760 --> 22:04.760]  He did it.
[22:04.760 --> 22:10.760]  And out of hundreds of thousands of people, he got a couple hundred to go in with him and kind of take selfies and the rest of it.
[22:10.760 --> 22:11.760]  You know the rest of the story.
[22:11.760 --> 22:18.760]  But the reason I'm harping on this is they're going to use the narrative that patriots did the Capitol and call it the biggest insurrection in history.
[22:18.760 --> 22:29.760]  When it was a dud, thank God, and turn that around to turn the entire anti-terrorism apparatus on us and ban free speech completely, even in the streets of America.
[22:29.760 --> 22:31.760]  And we can't allow that to happen.
[22:31.760 --> 22:46.760]  And we can't abut a bunch of accelerationists, FBI informants, and PSIOP experts from the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL, go out and wind up a bunch of idiots into Tim McVeigh, Part 2, Elohim City.
[22:46.760 --> 22:51.760]  I cut my teeth exposing all this.
[22:51.760 --> 22:52.760]  I cut my teeth.
[22:52.760 --> 23:00.760]  People like General Parton, the former head of Air Force weapons development, that came on the ground to expose Oklahoma City as a staged event.
[23:00.760 --> 23:11.760]  I got interviews with people on death row that no one else got with McVeigh about how he was in a secret army unit and set up with the bombing.
[23:11.760 --> 23:19.760]  I know this inside and out one way, another, every angle you can imagine.
[23:19.760 --> 23:21.760]  And that's the bottom line.
[23:21.760 --> 23:33.760]  I know what I'm seeing, I know what's going on, and that's going to be Biden's strategy, just like it was a Clinton strategy and the Obama strategy, but on steroids, to stage bombings and shootings and blame it on the Liberty Movement.
[23:33.760 --> 23:35.760]  You get ready for that.
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.760]  That's the next phase.
[23:38.760 --> 23:43.760]  And so we've got to get out front on this now.
[23:43.760 --> 23:45.760]  Now to the Q people.
[23:45.760 --> 23:54.760]  I'm going to explain something to you. I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
[23:54.760 --> 23:59.760]  When 9-11 happened and there was evidence the government bare minimum let it happen, I went on air and I exposed it.
[23:59.760 --> 24:04.760]  Not because it was popular, say that, but because it was true.
[24:04.760 --> 24:05.760]  Yeah.
[24:05.760 --> 24:08.760]  The Unabomber CIA mind control program.
[24:08.760 --> 24:13.760]  I tell people that they go, Jones, you're crazy.
[24:13.760 --> 24:16.760]  And then they look it up and turns out it's true.
[24:16.760 --> 24:27.760]  Or the Delta Force in 1999, the Seattle riots was actually running Antifa so they could attack the peaceful crowds by putting provocateurs in.
[24:27.760 --> 24:35.760]  That even came out in the newspaper and was declassified because the Delta forces are the command of Bill Clinton then and they take the orders of the president.
[24:35.760 --> 24:40.760]  This is the real world people.
[24:40.760 --> 24:45.760]  And so Q was there to pacify you so you wouldn't get involved.
[24:45.760 --> 24:48.760]  So you thought everything was taken care of.
[24:48.760 --> 25:02.760]  And then as soon as they got ready to use Q and blow up the Liberty movement, then they banned Q because you're going to wake up and realize it's a fraud and then use your networks you created to reform a resistance.
[25:02.760 --> 25:09.760]  So they got rid of all your accounts and shut your networks down once you were no longer useful to them.
[25:09.760 --> 25:12.760]  Do you understand?
[25:12.760 --> 25:17.760]  That is the reality.
[25:17.760 --> 25:20.760]  And so I'm very sad that Trump's leaving.
[25:20.760 --> 25:22.760]  I'm very sad they stole the election.
[25:22.760 --> 25:38.760]  He wanted a million people in DC to peacefully demonstrate so that we would show we had more numbers than they did and to show that Biden couldn't fill a parking lot and Trump could get a million people there that Trump was coming to speak at a stage that was set up on the other side.
[25:38.760 --> 25:40.760]  But it was all a setup.
[25:40.760 --> 25:43.760]  That stage was there the night before it was broken down by the time we got there.
[25:43.760 --> 25:45.760]  Oh, we were totally set up.
[25:45.760 --> 25:48.760]  We walked completely into a trap with people inside his administration.
[25:48.760 --> 25:56.760]  We know now that set Trump up and told him that it's Jones's idea to march the Capitol and all this stuff.
[25:56.760 --> 25:57.760]  And it's a great idea.
[25:57.760 --> 26:03.760]  You should tell him to lead it because they intended for me to go in there and lead that thing so they could throw my ass in prison.
[26:03.760 --> 26:06.760]  But of course, by the time I got there, I saw it was happening and tried to stop it.
[26:06.760 --> 26:10.760]  This is the real world, people.
[26:10.760 --> 26:12.760]  I want to get Trump's given her farewell address.
[26:12.760 --> 26:14.760]  Trump will give a farewell address.
[26:14.760 --> 26:15.760]  He better.
[26:15.760 --> 26:18.760]  A bunch of pardons are set to happen.
[26:18.760 --> 26:26.760]  But I got to tell you, we had a poll on info wars where 40 something percent of the people think Trump's going to stay in office.
[26:26.760 --> 26:33.760]  What an incredible, incredible sigh.
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.760]  So Matt Drudge just tweeted.
[26:37.760 --> 26:39.760]  Well, that's all for the Republic.
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.760]  But I'm not giving up because the Republic can be resurrected and we've got positive things we can do.
[26:44.760 --> 26:46.760]  The globalists are actually in trouble in many ways.
[26:46.760 --> 26:51.760]  I'm going to lay that out when we come back and break down the latest on the COVID martial law that's the tip of the enemy spear.
[26:51.760 --> 26:53.760]  We'll be right back.
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.760]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[26:57.760 --> 27:07.760]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big farmer are all pushing the COVID's most deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold.
[27:07.760 --> 27:10.760]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[27:10.760 --> 27:13.760]  That's why you see somebody dying into other nursing homes.
[27:13.760 --> 27:25.760]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bio weapons that are super deadly.
[27:25.760 --> 27:28.760]  Now they're having to resuscitate people that die, basically.
[27:28.760 --> 27:31.760]  When they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines.
[27:31.760 --> 27:34.760]  They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die.
[27:34.760 --> 27:36.760]  And that's on the record. It does that.
[27:36.760 --> 27:41.760]  Guillain-Barre's, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you, save and effective.
[27:41.760 --> 27:43.760]  No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory.
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.760]  And then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly.
[27:46.760 --> 27:56.760]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[27:56.760 --> 27:59.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts.
[27:59.760 --> 28:01.760]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[28:01.760 --> 28:07.760]  And now, only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent, it's all coming into place.
[28:07.760 --> 28:09.760]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[28:09.760 --> 28:18.760]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop. It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[28:18.760 --> 28:22.760]  And now, use the already martial law in place for COVID-19.
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.760]  And that's what it is, to then be expanded and become political and become permanent.
[28:27.760 --> 28:30.760]  They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked.
[28:30.760 --> 28:33.760]  They train you to do what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels.
[28:33.760 --> 28:35.760]  And now they launch the storm.
[28:35.760 --> 28:39.760]  The storm is heat. It's a globalist storm.
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.760]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump. There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.760]  They're trying to set you up. Don't be involved in violence.
[28:46.760 --> 28:50.760]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[28:50.760 --> 28:53.760]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[28:53.760 --> 29:04.760]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[29:04.760 --> 29:10.760]  Where did it come from?

[29:46.760 --> 29:56.760]  Other systems just don't compare.
[29:56.760 --> 30:04.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[30:04.760 --> 30:22.760]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God.
[30:22.760 --> 30:29.760]  Resistance to Tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[30:29.760 --> 30:31.760]  Alright, here's the deal.
[30:31.760 --> 30:37.760]  I've got Nick Cointes who disagrees with me. He thinks the Capitol is the most beautiful thing ever.
[30:37.760 --> 30:43.760]  And we're glad to disagree. I think Nick overall is not a bad guy. I get his perspective, but I disagree with him.
[30:43.760 --> 30:45.760]  I understand where he's coming from.
[30:45.760 --> 30:50.760]  But I'm going to try to get him to see things my way. We'll see what happens. He's coming in.
[30:50.760 --> 30:58.760]  James Sullivan, the brother of John Sullivan, the Antifa leader that successfully pulled this thing off and bragged about it before and did it.
[30:58.760 --> 31:02.760]  And was working with CNN and Anderson Goober.
[31:02.760 --> 31:09.760]  He is the master conspirator. Evidence is mounting, working with some of the other leftist paramilitary groups posing as conservatives.
[31:09.760 --> 31:12.760]  And then we also have Paul Joseph Watson, host of the Fourth Hour, the Noah Shroyer.
[31:12.760 --> 31:20.760]  Tomorrow we kick off at 8 a.m. with Harrison Smith and American Journal, which is mainly a call-in show, and he's doing a splendid job.
[31:20.760 --> 31:22.760]  So you get a chance to really sound off.
[31:22.760 --> 31:28.760]  But we're going to go commercial free at 11 a.m. Central, 12 noon for the inauguration tomorrow.
[31:28.760 --> 31:34.760]  Stations will still have their tones fired, meaning the stations aren't going to be censoring us.
[31:34.760 --> 31:40.760]  A lot of these stations don't have somebody at the board all the time, so a satellite sends a code down, a tone.
[31:40.760 --> 31:47.760]  And others have digitized systems, but the point is you'll hear me talking or things going on, and we're not going to have a lot of music or a lot of intros or outros.
[31:47.760 --> 31:51.760]  We're just going to be covering the inauguration commercial free, like a lot of other stations are.
[31:51.760 --> 31:54.760]  A lot of our stations actually will want this to be commercial free.
[31:54.760 --> 31:58.760]  And then if there's any terror attacks, any provocateur, false flags, we'll be here covering it.
[31:58.760 --> 32:02.760]  And we're going to be here until at least 10 at night, commercial free.
[32:02.760 --> 32:04.760]  We'll still take some breaks here and there.
[32:04.760 --> 32:07.760]  Still air some promos so people can get something to eat or go to the bathroom.
[32:07.760 --> 32:09.760]  But there are some special reports.
[32:09.760 --> 32:15.760]  But I'm going to be up here throughout the evening.
[32:15.760 --> 32:17.760]  I'm going to be up here throughout the evening with Owen Shroyer.
[32:17.760 --> 32:19.760]  We're going to have Roger Stone on.
[32:19.760 --> 32:23.760]  We're going to have Bob Barnes on.
[32:23.760 --> 32:25.760]  We're going to have Gerald Salente on.
[32:25.760 --> 32:27.760]  We're going to get Matt Bracken on.
[32:27.760 --> 32:29.760]  We're going to have your calls.
[32:29.760 --> 32:35.760]  It's going to be a lot of times it will take an hour of calls, and then we're going to have an hour of guests.
[32:35.760 --> 32:43.760]  An hour of calls, hour of guests is really what our plan is to really intensely take your calls and then have an hour of guests take your calls, hour of guests.
[32:43.760 --> 32:44.760]  So that is tomorrow.
[32:44.760 --> 32:52.760]  Okay, I've got so much incredible news and information, but really the big picture is this.
[32:52.760 --> 32:56.760]  I want to be positive here.
[32:56.760 --> 33:01.760]  The globalists have been planning this takeover for 100 years, really long.
[33:01.760 --> 33:02.760]  You can debate.
[33:02.760 --> 33:09.760]  I mean, 1850s they had the basic plan under Galton, Wedgwood and Huxley.
[33:09.760 --> 33:13.760]  Those are the grandparents of like Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley.
[33:13.760 --> 33:24.760]  And then by 1900, H.C. Wells was the leader of the Illuminati, and they had more of the modern plan all dialed up and ready.
[33:24.760 --> 33:27.760]  It was all extremely visionary, just ultra visionary.
[33:27.760 --> 33:31.760]  They're always 30, 40 years ahead of everybody, which is why they say they have the right to do this.
[33:31.760 --> 33:32.760]  And I understand their perspective.
[33:32.760 --> 33:36.760]  I mean, I'm not going to join them because I could feel my immortal soul is in danger.
[33:36.760 --> 33:38.760]  I can feel it, but I understand why they're doing it.
[33:38.760 --> 33:39.760]  It makes a lot of sense.
[33:39.760 --> 33:42.760]  I mean, the public's so dumb, they can openly take everything away from you and kill you.
[33:42.760 --> 33:44.760]  And you put up with it, you deserve to die.
[33:44.760 --> 33:51.760]  I mean, the difference is I'm not going to join them, though I am going to be meeting with the top globalists the next month, top globalists.
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.760]  So I will be entertaining, at least what they have to say, because it's important to have to keep those dialogues going.
[33:56.760 --> 34:00.760]  But this is very serious, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:00.760 --> 34:03.760]  This is your life, your soul, your children's future.
[34:03.760 --> 34:08.760]  And you just have to understand that I'm not going to sit here and debate and argue with people about this stuff.
[34:08.760 --> 34:11.760]  It's all out in the open, like a red light's a red light, a green light's a green light.
[34:11.760 --> 34:13.760]  A yellow light's a yellow light.
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.760]  It's on its face, prima facia.
[34:18.760 --> 34:22.760]  So the good news is the globalist plan has met major opposition.
[34:22.760 --> 34:27.760]  Humanity is starting to wake up and actually be who they should be and say no to it.
[34:27.760 --> 34:31.760]  And then the globalists don't get to play the social Darwin game.
[34:31.760 --> 34:38.760]  But if you don't recognize what they're doing, if you don't have an open dialogue with the globalist and talk to them person to person and say,
[34:38.760 --> 34:45.760]  I know what you're doing, you don't have a right, I'm going to resist you, then they have no respect for you and will run over you.
[34:45.760 --> 34:49.760]  They metaphysically need you to acquiesce and submit.
[34:49.760 --> 34:51.760]  They always have to leave you an escape valve.
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.760]  It is a rule of the universe that God has put down and they follow these rules.
[34:56.760 --> 35:01.760]  And if you won't study what they're up to, and if you won't study their plan versus God's plan,
[35:01.760 --> 35:12.760]  and if you won't make a spiritual, cultural, economic, and physical decision who you're with, then you are fair game to them.
[35:12.760 --> 35:17.760]  I don't take pleasure watching the public mutate into goblin like creatures.
[35:17.760 --> 35:19.760]  I don't take pleasure watching the IQ is plummet.
[35:19.760 --> 35:22.760]  I don't take pleasure watching cancer explode.
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.760]  I don't take enjoyment seeing how screwed up and falling apart humanity is.
[35:26.760 --> 35:39.760]  But the plan is to make humanity so dysfunctional that those of us that aren't part of it are going to basically have to either commit suicide or join with the globalist and wipe your asses out.
[35:39.760 --> 35:43.760]  Because, I mean, if you won't stand up for yourself, then I can't help you.
[35:43.760 --> 35:46.760]  And I'm not going to join the globalist.
[35:46.760 --> 35:50.760]  And I've openly had dialogues with some of their next to top level people.
[35:50.760 --> 35:54.760]  And I've had some dialogue with their top people and they want me to stop.
[35:54.760 --> 35:56.760]  And they are not going to be able to convince me.
[35:56.760 --> 35:59.760]  I'm going to try to convince them.
[35:59.760 --> 36:02.760]  But this is the real world folks, okay.
[36:02.760 --> 36:05.760]  I talk directly to the globalist.
[36:05.760 --> 36:13.760]  You know, these intelligence people and military people pretending like they're at the highest levels and they come on the shows and make little jokes about how they control them for worse.
[36:13.760 --> 36:15.760]  That's all a complete joke.
[36:15.760 --> 36:23.760]  The only thing that's real in this universe is information and how much information you have and your energy and what you resonate with.
[36:23.760 --> 36:25.760]  Goodness or badness.
[36:25.760 --> 36:27.760]  Just like they say in Cadet Shack.
[36:27.760 --> 36:29.760]  Danny, Danny, Danny, Danny.
[36:29.760 --> 36:32.760]  There's two kinds of people in this world, good people and bad people.
[36:32.760 --> 36:35.760]  Are you for goodness or are you for badness, Danny?
[36:35.760 --> 36:38.760]  But what is goodness and what is badness?
[36:38.760 --> 36:41.760]  I mean, Judge Schmales is a hypocrite and a fraud and a joke.
[36:41.760 --> 36:43.760]  He's not goodness.
[36:43.760 --> 36:44.760]  That's why he's a joke.
[36:44.760 --> 36:55.760]  So these globalists with all their power and all their money playing God are a joke and they know it at the end of the day.
[36:55.760 --> 36:59.760]  And they've been bullied into what they're doing by their grandparents and their grandparents.
[36:59.760 --> 37:04.760]  People are born into this and you don't easily get out of it.
[37:04.760 --> 37:09.760]  So if you want to know how to get out of this, you have free will.
[37:09.760 --> 37:14.760]  And God has put me here and many others here so that you get a chance to hear the truth and decide which side you're on.
[37:14.760 --> 37:15.760]  But that's it.
[37:15.760 --> 37:17.760]  That's it.
[37:17.760 --> 37:20.760]  If you live in denial and say, oh, I'm not sure if this is real.
[37:20.760 --> 37:22.760]  I'm not sure if this is then I can't help you.
[37:22.760 --> 37:24.760]  It's all over the top real.
[37:24.760 --> 37:25.760]  Everything we cover is real.
[37:25.760 --> 37:27.760]  Everything we cover is verifiable.
[37:27.760 --> 37:34.760]  All right, I'm going to hit the martial law COVID news and go through the stacks and we hit the next segment and we got these big guests coming up separately.
[37:34.760 --> 37:36.760]  Very exciting news to fund our operation.

[37:44.760 --> 37:47.760]  It's a ritual at the Jones house since this came out four years ago.

[38:18.760 --> 38:26.760]  I won't get more of this in for eight weeks is when our next orders set will come in because of all the lockdowns and problems we got half the order we asked for.
[38:26.760 --> 38:31.760]  So this will sell out in about four weeks at 50% off.
[38:31.760 --> 38:36.760]  But I am going to keep it there until it sells out because I want you to get it.
[38:36.760 --> 38:42.760]  It is 50% off vitamin mineral fusion, 96%.

[43:09.760 --> 43:12.760]  and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.

[43:20.760 --> 43:26.760]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates and our first product got rave reviews.

[44:19.760 --> 44:32.760]  Here we are.
[44:32.760 --> 44:40.760]  We are 23 hours and 13 minutes away from the Communist Chinese agent, Joe Biden, being installed.
[44:40.760 --> 44:41.760]  It's unbelievable.
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.760]  The president tried to turn the economy back on and did so many great things.
[44:45.760 --> 44:52.760]  He did prison reform, the list just goes on and on, stood up to Communist China, transferred jobs back.
[44:52.760 --> 44:54.760]  He's being rejected by the voters.
[44:54.760 --> 44:56.760]  No, he's not rejected by the voters.
[44:56.760 --> 44:58.760]  The globalists stole it.
[44:58.760 --> 45:00.760]  So how are they now going to install this fraud?
[45:00.760 --> 45:02.760]  No one's going to be in his inauguration.
[45:02.760 --> 45:06.760]  They're going to have all these American flags out there because they're non-Americans.
[45:06.760 --> 45:07.760]  They're globalists.
[45:07.760 --> 45:13.760]  So they have to again, overdo it that, oh, look, all these flags represent you.
[45:13.760 --> 45:18.760]  But what they really brought you is martial law.
[45:18.760 --> 45:28.760]  They've got American flags all the way from the capital halfway down towards the Washington Monument,
[45:28.760 --> 45:35.760]  but then everywhere else they have the flags of the world in a big United Nations push.
[45:35.760 --> 45:45.760]  And then they have a whole section of United Nations flags that then make up a map of the United States.
[45:45.760 --> 45:52.760]  So they've got all these displays set up while it's surrounded by hundreds of armored vehicles
[45:52.760 --> 46:00.760]  and 40,000 police and now 35,000 troops, including thousands and thousands that are regular army.
[46:00.760 --> 46:07.760]  We've seen units that the news has not reported are there. Our crews have shown them.
[46:07.760 --> 46:13.760]  The first mountain division, the list goes on and on.
[46:13.760 --> 46:15.760]  So they've got all their people.
[46:15.760 --> 46:19.760]  They're the urban warriors, the mountain divisions, everybody.
[46:19.760 --> 46:26.760]  And we're told, oh, this is to arrest all the pedophiles.
[46:26.760 --> 46:31.760]  Yes, Hillary has been in Gitmo for three years.
[46:31.760 --> 46:34.760]  Trust the plan.
[46:34.760 --> 46:37.760]  Let's go over some of the news here.
[46:37.760 --> 46:41.760]  Overhead shot, please. This is in FullWars.com. Steve Watson.
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.760]  California issues alarm over unusually high number of allergic reactions to Moderna vaccine.
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.760]  A lot of people died, but they're saying, oh, the vaccine didn't do it,
[46:50.760 --> 46:53.760]  but they thought maybe there's some bad lots of the vaccine.
[46:53.760 --> 46:56.760]  You know, Bill Gates told us it's going to be really strong,
[46:56.760 --> 46:59.760]  and a lot of people are going to die and get sick.
[46:59.760 --> 47:01.760]  And they have this New York Times go, Jones lies.
[47:01.760 --> 47:04.760]  Bill Gates does not say that, and then Joe Rogan plays a clip on a show.
[47:04.760 --> 47:09.760]  I mean, they metaphysically have to tell you what they're going to do.
[47:09.760 --> 47:14.760]  If you like convulsions, if you like narcolepsy, if you like yamber rays,
[47:14.760 --> 47:19.760]  if you like Bell's palsy, if you like cancer, then you're going to love this.
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.760]  mRNA, baby. And they go, well, Jones is technically wrong.
[47:24.760 --> 47:27.760]  It doesn't go into your mitochondria and reprogram them.
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.760]  It goes into the surface of the cells and then programs the other sectors
[47:33.760 --> 47:37.760]  to then go into the cell and program it. Same thing.
[47:37.760 --> 47:39.760]  It's ridiculous.
[47:39.760 --> 47:46.760]  Continuing, Israeli man reportedly dies of heart attack hours after getting COVID vaccine.
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.760]  There's just dozens of these articles over there. 88-year-old dies hours after COVID vaccination.
[47:51.760 --> 47:54.760]  They're saying so many old people are dying now after they take it.
[47:54.760 --> 47:57.760]  In some hospitals in New York, they'll have like 100 people and 12 die after they get it.
[47:57.760 --> 47:59.760]  But it's like, it's not related.
[47:59.760 --> 48:06.760]  But then in other European countries, they go, actually, it is killing people, but it's worth it.
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.760]  Two people in India died after receiving COVID jab at Barot.
[48:12.760 --> 48:16.760]  The text says, vaccine too risky for some. Oh, yeah, it even says on the insert,
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.760]  if you have allergic reactions, you're allergic to peanuts or bees or really anything,
[48:20.760 --> 48:24.760]  you shouldn't take it because it creates such an allergic reaction.
[48:24.760 --> 48:28.760]  When they go in and reprogram your mitochondria.
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.760]  But that's foreign countries restricting it. You're going to get yours, don't worry.
[48:33.760 --> 48:38.760]  And it's all an exercise of just, okay, a couple people died on the block getting their shot.
[48:38.760 --> 48:40.760]  No big deal. We just all die now.
[48:40.760 --> 48:43.760]  And of course, there's no long-term studies of what this does.
[48:43.760 --> 48:47.760]  They already actually did them in animals and we know the long-term reactions gives you cancer.
[48:47.760 --> 48:53.760]  But that's okay to send in synthetic nano-tech to reprogram yourselves. No big deal.
[48:53.760 --> 48:57.760]  23 die in Norway after receiving COVID vaccine.
[48:57.760 --> 49:00.760]  Of course, they underreport. They save every death attributed.
[49:00.760 --> 49:03.760]  They probably, it's actually 100 more.
[49:03.760 --> 49:09.760]  Duke, Harvard and John Hopkins experts say COVID lockdowns will cause
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.760]  1 million excess deaths for not getting medical treatment, suicide,
[49:13.760 --> 49:17.760]  and the rest goes on from there. That's just in the United States alone.
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.760]  So they contribute everybody that dies of other diseases and car wrecks to COVID.
[49:21.760 --> 49:23.760]  They said 400,000 approaching.
[49:23.760 --> 49:28.760]  And but in a year though, a million excess deaths because of all of the problems.
[49:28.760 --> 49:31.760]  But that's okay.
[49:31.760 --> 49:35.760]  Because it's for the greater good and Bill Gates says so.
[49:35.760 --> 49:41.760]  Continuing. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's science, bro.
[49:41.760 --> 49:45.760]  Experts now claim you should wear two masks, not one. Yes.
[49:45.760 --> 49:48.760]  Oh, and no amount of vaccines ever takes the mask off.
[49:48.760 --> 49:52.760]  She didn't report it again last night. The mask are never coming off.
[49:52.760 --> 49:55.760]  And they're going to give you at least five COVID shots a year.
[49:55.760 --> 50:00.760]  And you're going to have an app on your phone that tracks where you go and wait till we get to it.
[50:00.760 --> 50:08.760]  It's not just China now that makes you scan a barcode QR code to get into your house or leave your house as a president.
[50:08.760 --> 50:13.760]  England just announced it.
[50:13.760 --> 50:15.760]  It's going UK wide.
[50:15.760 --> 50:18.760]  You'll have to have a cell phone to leave your house and it'll track everywhere you go.
[50:18.760 --> 50:21.760]  It's all official now. Hope you enjoy it.
[50:21.760 --> 50:24.760]  It's science, bro. Now wear your two mask.
[50:24.760 --> 50:27.760]  You know, if it saves one life, do it.
[50:27.760 --> 50:31.760]  Hey, it gives you bacterial pneumonia. I don't care. I'm a virtue signaler.
[50:31.760 --> 50:35.760]  And now in France, you wear dog collars that report you if you get too close to someone.
[50:35.760 --> 50:39.760]  No, this isn't our wellie and this isn't just a big numb.
[50:39.760 --> 50:41.760]  There's a whole bunch of videos coming out every day.
[50:41.760 --> 50:45.760]  Healthy woman uncontrollably shakes after receiving COVID vaccine.
[50:45.760 --> 50:49.760]  Well, yeah, it says in the insert, it does that your body's never been hit with something like this.
[50:49.760 --> 50:55.760]  Seychelles Islands opens for the holidays, but only for the vaccinated.
[50:55.760 --> 50:58.760]  And then they said, it doesn't matter if you have autoimmune disorders.
[50:58.760 --> 51:00.760]  It doesn't matter if you have a bad reaction. We don't care.
[51:00.760 --> 51:04.760]  You don't have it. You don't come.
[51:04.760 --> 51:06.760]  See, it's just the tyranny's here.
[51:06.760 --> 51:09.760]  The storm is here. The new order is here.
[51:09.760 --> 51:11.760]  And everybody just thought Trump could fix it all.
[51:11.760 --> 51:13.760]  Well, he's 40 chess. Everything's handled.
[51:13.760 --> 51:14.760]  And now you see.
[51:14.760 --> 51:17.760]  So the good thing is once Trump's gone, I'm sad he's going.
[51:17.760 --> 51:21.760]  People won't have him to say he's saving us anymore and people will have to do it themselves
[51:21.760 --> 51:23.760]  and start not complying with the system.
[51:23.760 --> 51:28.760]  There's a giant awakening happening and it needs to be all about Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates
[51:28.760 --> 51:32.760]  and Ted Turner and the Rockefeller Foundation that run all this on record
[51:32.760 --> 51:34.760]  and ran the Wuhan lab.
[51:34.760 --> 51:38.760]  And we're in trouble six years ago for setting it up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[51:38.760 --> 51:41.760]  Everything should be about how their master criminals, how their wealth doubled,
[51:41.760 --> 51:44.760]  how they're running the scam, how it's their fault,
[51:44.760 --> 51:47.760]  how they don't have liability protection for the racketeering they've engaged in.
[51:47.760 --> 51:50.760]  And they'll lose it. They'll go down in history.
[51:50.760 --> 51:57.760]  But if you just sit here and comply with it, it's meant to unfold where all of us are non-essential.
[51:57.760 --> 52:01.760]  Civilization collapses. The third world starts mass dying, floods the first world.
[52:01.760 --> 52:04.760]  The UN comes in and takes over with a world government tax
[52:04.760 --> 52:09.760]  to, quote, stop the migration flows and hold us hostage.
[52:09.760 --> 52:12.760]  But not before they don't bring in 600 million people to the U.S.
[52:12.760 --> 52:15.760]  That's the official UN number, 640 million.
[52:15.760 --> 52:20.760]  France wants 240 million Africans alone by 2040.
[52:20.760 --> 52:24.760]  They're now ordering people to take in at least one African into every house they've got.
[52:24.760 --> 52:27.760]  That African will be a UN agent to control and monitor you.
[52:27.760 --> 52:30.760]  Again, they're just using these poor third world slaves.
[52:30.760 --> 52:34.760]  U.K. authorities could force people to take selfies every day
[52:34.760 --> 52:37.760]  to prove they're self-isolating when they go to and from their homes.
[52:37.760 --> 52:41.760]  Now they're announcing the phase. It's always, oh, they're going to do it, then they do it.
[52:41.760 --> 52:48.760]  Poll, plurality of Brits supports government spying on people via cell phone tracking
[52:48.760 --> 52:51.760]  to enforce the lockdown to keep us all safe, which the scientists admit doesn't help us
[52:51.760 --> 52:54.760]  and makes us sicker, and people under lockdown have higher levels of dying,
[52:54.760 --> 52:58.760]  and they call it COVID.
[52:58.760 --> 53:00.760]  I had a lot of family, and I got a lot of good friends.
[53:00.760 --> 53:06.760]  One lady's awesome uncle, one of her best friends.
[53:06.760 --> 53:09.760]  He was in a nice, fancy retirement area in Northern California.
[53:09.760 --> 53:12.760]  They locked him in for six months, and he died.
[53:12.760 --> 53:13.760]  He was totally healthy, totally happy.
[53:13.760 --> 53:14.760]  He just laid down and died.
[53:14.760 --> 53:15.760]  He said, I'm going to lay down and die.
[53:15.760 --> 53:16.760]  I'm going to stop eating.
[53:16.760 --> 53:17.760]  They won't let me out.
[53:17.760 --> 53:18.760]  He's laid down and died.
[53:18.760 --> 53:20.760]  And they celebrated, oh, liberal.
[53:20.760 --> 53:22.760]  Everything's so liberal now.
[53:22.760 --> 53:23.760]  Get rid of the old people.
[53:23.760 --> 53:27.760]  Germany's subject to taking COVID rule breakers in refugee camps.
[53:27.760 --> 53:29.760]  The refugees will be in your house.
[53:29.760 --> 53:31.760]  You'll be in the refugee camp.
[53:31.760 --> 53:34.760]  It's all beneficially announced. Yay.
[53:34.760 --> 53:38.760]  And the UN wants women to know that it's cervical cancer awareness month
[53:38.760 --> 53:40.760]  or the rarest forms of cancer.
[53:40.760 --> 53:41.760]  Absolutely treatable.
[53:41.760 --> 53:44.760]  If you don't have bad nutrition, basically you can't die from it.
[53:44.760 --> 53:47.760]  But they really want you to take a Gardasil shot.
[53:47.760 --> 53:50.760]  Oh, which in the studies, what does it do?
[53:50.760 --> 53:53.760]  Attacks your ovaries and gives you cancer.
[53:53.760 --> 53:55.760]  Oh, you're going to get cancer.
[53:55.760 --> 53:56.760]  All right.
[53:56.760 --> 53:59.760]  Roll up that sleeve of your 11-year-old daughter.
[53:59.760 --> 54:01.760]  But remember, people stop taking the Gardasil
[54:01.760 --> 54:04.760]  because so many girls got sterile or died.
[54:04.760 --> 54:09.760]  All those local newscasts about she was the cheerleader.
[54:09.760 --> 54:11.760]  Oh, she's paralyzed now.
[54:11.760 --> 54:13.760]  Oh, she died.
[54:13.760 --> 54:17.760]  Oh, it's liberal.
[54:17.760 --> 54:19.760]  And Joe Biden is coming.
[54:19.760 --> 54:22.760]  He's coming to save you.
[54:22.760 --> 54:23.760]  All right.
[54:23.760 --> 54:25.760]  So we have a lot of news coming up.
[54:25.760 --> 54:26.760]  Oh, don't worry.
[54:26.760 --> 54:29.760]  Biden picks transgender who encourage COVID-safe orgies
[54:29.760 --> 54:32.760]  as assistant health secretary.
[54:32.760 --> 54:36.760]  Yes, the new ruling class is transgendered men.
[54:36.760 --> 54:38.760]  White transgendered men is the new ruling class.
[54:38.760 --> 54:42.760]  We'll be right back.
[54:42.760 --> 54:44.760]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[54:44.760 --> 54:45.760]  Thank you for holding.
[54:45.760 --> 54:47.760]  How are you doing, Alex?
[54:47.760 --> 54:48.760]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[54:48.760 --> 54:49.760]  We're in such a critical time.
[54:49.760 --> 54:50.760]  Brother, how are you?
[54:50.760 --> 54:51.760]  I love you, man.
[54:51.760 --> 54:55.760]  I want to make a quick plug, that DNA force.
[54:55.760 --> 54:56.760]  I love it.
[54:56.760 --> 54:57.760]  I've been using it quite a while.
[54:57.760 --> 55:00.760]  And I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day.
[55:00.760 --> 55:03.760]  And I see that it contains quercetin,
[55:03.760 --> 55:06.760]  which according to some published studies
[55:06.760 --> 55:10.760]  that Dr. Merkala has cited is an ionophore
[55:10.760 --> 55:12.760]  similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[55:12.760 --> 55:15.760]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[55:15.760 --> 55:18.760]  So people might want to take a look at that.
[55:18.760 --> 55:20.760]  All I know is with DNA force,
[55:20.760 --> 55:24.760]  we went out and looked at these high-end products
[55:24.760 --> 55:26.760]  that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription,
[55:26.760 --> 55:28.760]  but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle.
[55:28.760 --> 55:30.760]  Because there's a lot of expensive product in them.
[55:30.760 --> 55:31.760]  It's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[55:31.760 --> 55:35.760]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together.
[55:35.760 --> 55:36.760]  And that's what produced this.
[55:36.760 --> 55:37.760]  So thanks.
[55:37.760 --> 55:38.760]  Thanks for the plug.
[55:44.760 --> 55:47.760]  Fox has betrayed President Trump, as I predicted they would.
[55:47.760 --> 55:49.760]  They've always been part of the establishment.
[55:49.760 --> 55:51.760]  And it's only going to get worse.
[55:51.760 --> 55:54.760]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office
[55:54.760 --> 55:58.760]  for a second term on the 20th, the system is going to drop
[55:58.760 --> 56:00.760]  the hammer harder than ever on this Republic.
[56:00.760 --> 56:02.760]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[56:02.760 --> 56:04.760]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[56:04.760 --> 56:07.760]  They're going to cut off the energy source to U.S.
[56:07.760 --> 56:09.760]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[56:09.760 --> 56:11.760]  This is economic domination.
[56:11.760 --> 56:12.760]  This is economic war.
[56:12.760 --> 56:13.760]  We are being consolidated.
[56:13.760 --> 56:14.760]  We are being taken over.
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.760]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[56:18.760 --> 56:21.760]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population
[56:21.760 --> 56:25.760]  and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership
[56:25.760 --> 56:27.760]  of all the infrastructure and property.
[56:27.760 --> 56:29.760]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[56:29.760 --> 56:31.760]  That's what the great reset is.
[56:31.760 --> 56:33.760]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[56:33.760 --> 56:35.760]  That's what social distancing is.
[56:35.760 --> 56:38.760]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[56:38.760 --> 56:40.760]  No small businesses will be there.
[56:40.760 --> 56:42.760]  This is a master plan.
[56:42.760 --> 56:43.760]  Say no.
[56:43.760 --> 56:49.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:14.760 --> 57:16.760]  There's an excellent report at townhall.com.
[57:16.760 --> 57:18.760]  We've got a link to info wars.com as well.
[57:18.760 --> 57:21.760]  Carlson explains what message the Dems are sending
[57:21.760 --> 57:23.760]  with the militarization of D.C.
[57:23.760 --> 57:25.760]  Then we have James Sullivan,
[57:25.760 --> 57:29.760]  the brother of the BLM anti-fuck leader
[57:29.760 --> 57:32.760]  who helped set off the false flag and bragged about it,
[57:32.760 --> 57:35.760]  then arrested and released without bail.
[57:35.760 --> 57:37.760]  He's going to join us and tell us from his view
[57:37.760 --> 57:39.760]  what's really going on next segment.
[57:39.760 --> 57:40.760]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[57:40.760 --> 57:42.760]  Welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[57:42.760 --> 57:44.760]  Our capital city, Washington,
[57:44.760 --> 57:46.760]  is under military occupation tonight.
[57:46.760 --> 57:48.760]  By inauguration day,
[57:48.760 --> 57:50.760]  there are expected to be more than 26,000
[57:50.760 --> 57:52.760]  armed federal troops in Washington.
[57:52.760 --> 57:54.760]  No living American has seen a moment
[57:54.760 --> 57:56.760]  like the one we're watching now.
[57:56.760 --> 57:58.760]  26,000 soldiers,
[57:58.760 --> 58:00.760]  that's more than five times
[58:00.760 --> 58:02.760]  the number of American military personnel
[58:02.760 --> 58:04.760]  currently stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[58:04.760 --> 58:06.760]  combined.
[58:06.760 --> 58:08.760]  That is more than twice the number of troops
[58:08.760 --> 58:10.760]  that President Lyndon Johnson ordered to Washington
[58:10.760 --> 58:12.760]  in April of 1968.
[58:12.760 --> 58:14.760]  In April of 1968,
[58:14.760 --> 58:16.760]  Washington, D.C. was literally on fire.
[58:16.760 --> 58:18.760]  Race riots had broken out
[58:18.760 --> 58:20.760]  after the assassination of Martin Luther King,
[58:20.760 --> 58:22.760]  whose memory we celebrate today.
[58:22.760 --> 58:24.760]  More than a thousand people were injured
[58:24.760 --> 58:26.760]  in those riots and at least 13 of them died.
[58:26.760 --> 58:28.760]  Much of the capital was leveled
[58:28.760 --> 58:30.760]  and it stayed that way,
[58:30.760 --> 58:32.760]  blocks of charred rubble for decades.
[58:32.760 --> 58:34.760]  If you visited Washington in the 1990s,
[58:34.760 --> 58:36.760]  you remember what it looked like.
[58:36.760 --> 58:38.760]  But according to our current leaders,
[58:38.760 --> 58:40.760]  the insurrection of January 6th
[58:40.760 --> 58:42.760]  was much worse than any of that.
[58:42.760 --> 58:44.760]  So far, here is the death toll
[58:44.760 --> 58:46.760]  from that day.
[58:46.760 --> 58:48.760]  A police officer was hit in the head by rioters,
[58:48.760 --> 58:50.760]  then later had a stroke and died at a local hospital.
[58:50.760 --> 58:52.760]  An unarmed protester was shot to death
[58:52.760 --> 58:54.760]  by authorities as she tried to climb through a window.
[58:54.760 --> 58:56.760]  A woman may have been trampled to death
[58:56.760 --> 58:58.760]  by the crowd.
[58:58.760 --> 59:00.760]  As of tonight, those are the three casualties
[59:00.760 --> 59:02.760]  we can confirm from the riot at the
[59:02.760 --> 59:04.760]  Capitol Building on January 6th.
[59:04.760 --> 59:06.760]  In response to that,
[59:06.760 --> 59:08.760]  the leaders have assembled the largest military presence
[59:08.760 --> 59:10.760]  in Washington in all of
[59:10.760 --> 59:12.760]  American history during peacetime.
[59:12.760 --> 59:14.760]  In 1864,
[59:14.760 --> 59:16.760]  the Civil War raged on the other side of the Potomac,
[59:16.760 --> 59:18.760]  and Americans died every day
[59:18.760 --> 59:20.760]  in large numbers in battle.
[59:20.760 --> 59:22.760]  There were fewer federal troops
[59:22.760 --> 59:24.760]  protecting Washington D.C.
[59:24.760 --> 59:26.760]  than there are tonight.
[59:26.760 --> 59:28.760]  And it's truly a national force.
[59:28.760 --> 59:30.760]  The guardsmen you see in Washington
[59:30.760 --> 59:32.760]  have come from every state in the Union,
[59:32.760 --> 59:34.760]  as well as from Puerto Rico.
[59:34.760 --> 59:36.760]  What is that?
[59:36.760 --> 59:38.760]  There's no practical or operational justification
[59:38.760 --> 59:40.760]  for it.
[59:40.760 --> 59:42.760]  For decades, Washington D.C. is at the highest
[59:42.760 --> 59:44.760]  per capita law enforcement presence in the country,
[59:44.760 --> 59:46.760]  and one of the highest in the world.
[59:46.760 --> 59:48.760]  So there was no need to fly in troops
[59:48.760 --> 59:50.760]  from Alaska to keep the city safe.
[59:50.760 --> 59:52.760]  But keeping the city safe
[59:52.760 --> 59:54.760]  was hardly the point of the exercise.
[59:54.760 --> 59:56.760]  The murder rate in the District of Columbia
[59:56.760 --> 59:58.760]  has risen with terrifying speed over the last six months.
[59:58.760 --> 1:00:00.760]  Men, women, and children
[1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:02.760]  shot to death in the streets.
[1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.760]  The Guard seems to care about that,
[1:00:04.760 --> 1:00:06.760]  or even notice their deaths.
[1:00:06.760 --> 1:00:08.760]  So no matter what they are telling you,
[1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:10.760]  those 26,000 federal troops
[1:00:10.760 --> 1:00:12.760]  are not there for your safety.
[1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:14.760]  Instead, unmistakably,
[1:00:14.760 --> 1:00:16.760]  the Democratic Party is using those troops
[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:18.760]  to send the rest of us a message about power.
[1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:20.760]  We're in charge now.
[1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:22.760]  We run this nation,
[1:00:22.760 --> 1:00:24.760]  from Honolulu to our colony in the Caribbean,
[1:00:24.760 --> 1:00:26.760]  and everything in between,
[1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:28.760]  very much including where you and your family live.
[1:00:28.760 --> 1:00:30.760]  Do not question us.
[1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:32.760]  Republicans enforce our decrees.
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.760]  We control the Pentagon.
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.760]  And indeed, they do control the Pentagon.
[1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:38.760]  Republicans have spent years
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:40.760]  ignoring the leftward drift of our officer corps.
[1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:42.760]  But we can't ignore it now.
[1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:44.760]  The mask is off.
[1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:46.760]  Our military leadership, the very same generals
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:48.760]  who howled at the idea of deploying American troops
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:50.760]  to stop an invasion of our southern border,
[1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:52.760]  those same generals,
[1:00:52.760 --> 1:00:54.760]  sent tens of thousands of soldiers
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:56.760]  with rifles to Washington,
[1:00:56.760 --> 1:00:58.760]  purely as a show of force
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:00.760]  in behalf of the political party they support.
[1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:02.760]  And once they did that,
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:04.760]  they then allowed Democratic politicians
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:06.760]  to degrade and politicize the military itself.
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:08.760]  Democrats in Congress
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:10.760]  demanded that the troops sent to Washington
[1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:12.760]  this week
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:14.760]  submit to a political purity test,
[1:01:14.760 --> 1:01:16.760]  ideological vetting, as they put it,
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:18.760]  to make certain that every soldier
[1:01:18.760 --> 1:01:20.760]  professed loyalty to the new regime.
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.760]  Not loyalty to our country,
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:24.760]  not loyalty to our Constitution.
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:26.760]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:28.760]  Takeover.
[1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.760]  Trust the plan.
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:32.760]  Almost the entire top military brass are
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:34.760]  Communist, Globalist and Wahhabist.
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:36.760]  Just like Brennan,
[1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:38.760]  who voted for the Communist Party
[1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:40.760]  and joined Wahhabism.
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:42.760]  That's who they are.
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:44.760]  They hate this country,
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:46.760]  and they're bringing it down right now,
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:48.760]  and they're letting you know.
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:50.760]  I'll tell you through their operative cue
[1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:52.760]  that we're winning while we're losing.
[1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:56.760]  Cue is a Bolshevik operation.
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:58.760]  Cue is a relaunch of
[1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:00.760]  Operation Trust
[1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.760]  that the Soviets used in the 1920s
[1:02:02.760 --> 1:02:04.760]  to identify who their opposition was.
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.760]  That's when George Arwell wrote
[1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:08.760]  1984 that was about a futuristic,
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:10.760]  Stalinistic world government system.
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:12.760]  He talked about Emmanuel Goldstein,
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.760]  who was the supposed leader of the resistance,
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:16.760]  but really worked for
[1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:18.760]  the controllers to be able to identify
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:20.760]  anyone that was a dissident.
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:22.760]  That's what's happening.
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:24.760]  So the storm of Cue is real.
[1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:26.760]  It's a globalist martial law takeover
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:28.760]  of America.
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:30.760]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:32.760]  but you have been had.
[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:34.760]  I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on,
[1:02:34.760 --> 1:02:36.760]  but I didn't realize it was the main thrust.
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:38.760]  The main thrust the globalist takeover
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:40.760]  is Operation Trust 2.0.
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:42.760]  We're covering it all live on the air
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:44.760]  at m4wars.com and newswars.com.
[1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:46.760]  We'll have reporters on the ground
[1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:48.760]  covering the inauguration
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:50.760]  of the globalist for planting false flags.
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:03:19.760]  We pray we can stop them.
[1:03:20.760 --> 1:03:22.760]  You get censored, you get taken down,
[1:03:22.760 --> 1:03:24.760]  even if you are top computer scientist
[1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:26.760]  or eyewitnesses to the fraud.
[1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:28.760]  And so Trump wanted a big rally
[1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.760]  to show that he had big numbers
[1:03:30.760 --> 1:03:32.760]  and that Biden didn't.
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:34.760]  And we obliged, we believe in that.
[1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:36.760]  He said he wanted a peaceful rally,
[1:03:36.760 --> 1:03:38.760]  so did his son at the speech.
[1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:40.760]  We marched to the Capitol,
[1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:42.760]  but before we got there, anti-fun others
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:44.760]  were already there.
[1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:46.760]  The accelerationists were already there.
[1:03:46.760 --> 1:03:48.760]  They've taken credit for it.
[1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:50.760]  He had hundreds of thousands discredited
[1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:52.760]  by a handful of people that broke in
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:54.760]  and then others, a few hundred,
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:56.760]  to follow them.
[1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:58.760]  And that's just a fact, that's who took credit for it.
[1:03:58.760 --> 1:04:00.760]  They get to keep their Twitter accounts.
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:02.760]  But everybody else doesn't.
[1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:04.760]  John Sullivan, last time I checked this morning,
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:06.760]  still has his Twitter account.
[1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:08.760]  The Boogaloo's taking credit for the Capitol.
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:10.760]  They've got their accounts.
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:12.760]  But we got James Sullivan on,
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:14.760]  and I almost interviewed him on the 7th,
[1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:16.760]  but we had to leave early.
[1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:18.760]  And James Sullivan
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:20.760]  is the founder of Civilized Awakening
[1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:22.760]  and the conservative brother of John Sullivan.
[1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:24.760]  He exposed and was
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:26.760]  in directly opposition to Black Lives Matter
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:28.760]  and John Sullivan in Utah,
[1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:30.760]  where his brother has been arrested
[1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:32.760]  for engineering riots before.
[1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:34.760]  And of course, he bragged he was going to bring anti for there
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:36.760]  and burned down the Capitol to blame Trump.
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:38.760]  He didn't get to burn down the Capitol,
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:40.760]  but he was videotaped saying it over and over again.
[1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:42.760]  But he did go on Anderson Cooper,
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:44.760]  and Anderson Cooper is very, very proud of his work.
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:46.760]  So, James, wow, incredible.
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:48.760]  Tell us about yourself, about your brother,
[1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:50.760]  and why you're on air with us, and what you witnessed.
[1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:52.760]  Because you're very well known in Utah.
[1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:54.760]  You've been in news for a while, countering your brother.
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:56.760]  I mean, you're not just popping up now after this.
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:04:58.760]  You've been warning folks for a while.
[1:04:58.760 --> 1:05:00.760]  This must be really hard for you to do.
[1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:02.760]  Yeah, yeah, it was.
[1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:04.760]  My father raised John and I.
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:06.760]  We're both like two of four brothers,
[1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:08.760]  and he raised us to love our country,
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:10.760]  and he raised us to love our country,
[1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:12.760]  and he raised us to love our country.
[1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:14.760]  Our God put family first,
[1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:16.760]  and seeing John coming out
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:18.760]  in Provo originally,
[1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:20.760]  and organizing that protest
[1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:22.760]  where he lied to the people,
[1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:24.760]  saying that he had a permit,
[1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:26.760]  told the government, allegedly,
[1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:28.760]  that it was legal for them to hold up cars
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:30.760]  to save the people,
[1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.760]  and then watching on the news
[1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:34.760]  and on his videos that he posted.
[1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:36.760]  Those people are that person
[1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:38.760]  getting shot in the shoulder.
[1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:40.760]  Coming out wasn't something easy.
[1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:42.760]  I joined a Patriot militia group
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:44.760]  called Utah Citizens Alarm,
[1:05:44.760 --> 1:05:46.760]  Casey Robertson,
[1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:48.760]  and over time,
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:50.760]  John became more and more radical
[1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:52.760]  in citing violence
[1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:54.760]  throughout the Salt Lake Valley,
[1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:56.760]  and I came out against him.
[1:05:56.760 --> 1:05:58.760]  He had become so radical
[1:05:58.760 --> 1:06:00.760]  that Black Lives Matter
[1:06:00.760 --> 1:06:02.760]  Utah and other activist groups
[1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:04.760]  deemed him as a problem
[1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:06.760]  and an instigator.
[1:06:06.760 --> 1:06:08.760]  What he likes to do is he will instigate violence,
[1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:10.760]  and he will
[1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:12.760]  stand back and videotape it for views.
[1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:14.760]  So I actually worked with several members
[1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:16.760]  of Black Lives Matter very, very shortly
[1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:18.760]  and briefly, just to remove
[1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:20.760]  from the community.
[1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:22.760]  And now,
[1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:24.760]  he's popped up in
[1:06:24.760 --> 1:06:26.760]  DC.
[1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:28.760]  Were you...
[1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:30.760]  Did you see his postings about
[1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:32.760]  what he was going to DC to do before?
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:34.760]  When did you become aware that your brother was involved in DC?
[1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:36.760]  I knew
[1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:38.760]  that
[1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:40.760]  John was going to DC
[1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:42.760]  with his profile
[1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.760]  Jayden
[1:06:44.760 --> 1:06:46.760]  Xander on Twitter.
[1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:48.760]  We're also part of a bipartisan
[1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:50.760]  documentary
[1:06:50.760 --> 1:06:52.760]  that has been following... They have a team following me,
[1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:54.760]  and they have a team following him.
[1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:56.760]  So they had told me that he was going.
[1:06:56.760 --> 1:06:58.760]  I didn't want to go to DC
[1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:00.760]  just because I'd seen the stuff he was
[1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:02.760]  posting. I was in a couple of
[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:04.760]  group chats
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:06.760]  under a different name
[1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:08.760]  watching the traffic, and
[1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:10.760]  I decided not to go
[1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:12.760]  because a lot of them were talking about looking for me.
[1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:14.760]  So
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:16.760]  I stayed back.
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:18.760]  What was it like for you,
[1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:20.760]  because I know you love your brother, what was it like for you to see him
[1:07:20.760 --> 1:07:22.760]  go from big time
[1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:24.760]  Antifa BLM agitator
[1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:26.760]  to superstar...
[1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:28.760]  I mean, if I fumbled
[1:07:28.760 --> 1:07:30.760]  in the super, super bowl in the one yard line
[1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:32.760]  not understanding I was being set up and all this and I did
[1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:34.760]  I don't take blame for it because I'm in the arena
[1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:36.760]  and we were fighting for election
[1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:38.760]  integrity and calling for legal and lawful
[1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:40.760]  things to happen. I'm now being accused of
[1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:42.760]  trying to foment things.
[1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:44.760]  But he didn't fumble at the one yard line.
[1:07:44.760 --> 1:07:46.760]  He scored and won the game against America
[1:07:46.760 --> 1:07:48.760]  in the super, super bowl of our Republic.
[1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:50.760]  I mean, if they put
[1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:52.760]  a tombstone saying our Republic died
[1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:54.760]  in the future, if we don't come back from this
[1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:56.760]  it will be your brother and people
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:58.760]  liking that day that helped kill the country.
[1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:00.760]  Yeah.
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:02.760]  Honestly, after
[1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:04.760]  combating him for the past
[1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:06.760]  six months and getting him removed from our
[1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:08.760]  community here, or the activist community here
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:10.760]  seeing him wasn't really
[1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:12.760]  that much of a surprise. After he was
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:14.760]  removed from
[1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:16.760]  Utah, he traveled to Kenosha
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:18.760]  to California to Portland
[1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:20.760]  trying to get into these Antifa communities and they would
[1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:22.760]  kick him out. So seeing him here wasn't really
[1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:24.760]  that big of a surprise.
[1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:26.760]  I do have a little bit
[1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:28.760]  of information that
[1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:30.760]  prior to the rally, he had worked
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.760]  with a lone rogue
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:34.760]  person that's affiliated with the Proud Boys
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:36.760]  in getting proprietary
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:38.760]  information to pass on with the caravan
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:40.760]  meetups. So he has a little bit more
[1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:42.760]  and I've communicated that with the FBI
[1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:44.760]  but he has a little bit more
[1:08:44.760 --> 1:08:46.760]  involvement than just showing up and videotaping
[1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:50.760]  the event.
[1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:52.760]  And watching him doing that
[1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:54.760]  and coming out against him publicly for the second
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:56.760]  time, it honestly wasn't that hard to do
[1:08:56.760 --> 1:08:58.760]  because knowing that he and
[1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:00.760]  among a couple other people were instrumental
[1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:02.760]  in planning and orchestrating this
[1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:04.760]  to instigate
[1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:06.760]  violence within the Patriots,
[1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:08.760]  it was something that I felt I had to do.
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:10.760]  So I kind of, I woke up from
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:12.760]  a nap and I had like over 600 messages
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:14.760]  of people trying to verify
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:16.760]  that that person was my brother
[1:09:16.760 --> 1:09:18.760]  and then after that I started working with
[1:09:18.760 --> 1:09:20.760]  authorities and getting him indicted.
[1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:22.760]  What do you
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:24.760]  make of the judge releasing him
[1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:26.760]  without bail?
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:28.760]  Utah has a
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:30.760]  really weird bail reform law
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:32.760]  on the books.
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:34.760]  So if he doesn't have like a violent
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:36.760]  offense or he wasn't threatening
[1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:38.760]  people, which he was,
[1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:40.760]  they put him on house arrest
[1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:42.760]  without bail. It was
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:44.760]  to kind of combat people who couldn't afford bail.
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:46.760]  Sure, so it's the
[1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:48.760]  prison reform thing. Of course he never gets
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:50.760]  his hands bloody though. He's more like a
[1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:52.760]  colonel. He just sends
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:54.760]  others out to do it.
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:56.760]  Have you talked to your brother since
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:58.760]  the 6th?
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:00.760]  Since the 6th, no, I have not.
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:02.760]  I've made it a really big point not to
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:04.760]  have any real communication with him.
[1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:06.760]  He probably wouldn't
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:08.760]  return anything. I talk,
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:10.760]  respond to me talking. I just know that
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:12.760]  in his mind
[1:10:12.760 --> 1:10:14.760]  he's just a
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:16.760]  he's a reporter
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:18.760]  and I had a
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:20.760]  hour-long conversation with him with the
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:22.760]  documentary. We sat in a room
[1:10:22.760 --> 1:10:24.760]  for the first time talking for five months
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:26.760]  and I got to listen to him for an hour.
[1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:28.760]  He struggled to tell me what he actually
[1:10:28.760 --> 1:10:30.760]  believed in.
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:32.760]  So I'm just forced to believe that he's
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:34.760]  actually, he's either addicted to
[1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:36.760]  like the fame or the
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:38.760]  attention that comes from it.
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:40.760]  He does have Marxist
[1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:42.760]  ideas and beliefs.
[1:10:42.760 --> 1:10:44.760]  But from what I can see,
[1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:46.760]  he's just trying to instigate
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:48.760]  violence. He's one of those Intifa members
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:50.760]  that instigates violence and then steps back
[1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:52.760]  and livestream it.
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:54.760]  He's kind of like that
[1:10:54.760 --> 1:10:56.760]  supervillain that tells the superhero
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:58.760]  they're like evil plan
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:00.760]  and he'll go and do stuff and they'll put all
[1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:02.760]  the evidence up on Twitter and then get
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:04.760]  confused
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:06.760]  why he's being arrested or indicted.
[1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:08.760]  He literally put all the evidence
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:10.760]  up there.
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:12.760]  But then he magically,
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:14.760]  he gets on Anderson Cooper who's CIA,
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:16.760]  he magically
[1:11:16.760 --> 1:11:18.760]  goes around the country doing this just like
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:20.760]  Senator Cain's son got caught
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:22.760]  doing. I think there's going to be evidence
[1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:24.760]  coming out that your brother was being directed
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:26.760]  by some higher ups.
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:28.760]  Oh yeah, yeah, there's actually a lot
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:30.760]  of people that have reached out to me with
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:32.760]  that information
[1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:34.760]  and ask me if I knew anything about the
[1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:36.760]  Special Interest Groups, especially some
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:38.760]  in Utah that have helped him out in the
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.760]  past. I mean, he was able to build a house
[1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:42.760]  in Sandy at the age of 25
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:44.760]  and he started doing this and
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:46.760]  he's been able to travel around before the
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:48.760]  documentary came out and
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:50.760]  it's just kind of concerning about how
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:52.760]  like now that he's not working, he still has
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:54.760]  the funds to do that. Well yeah, the FBI was
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:56.760]  really doing his job. This is a racketeering
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:58.760]  criminal operation, a terrorist operation
[1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:00.760]  in my view and they would grab his receipts.
[1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:02.760]  They have all that. They have his credit card
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:04.760]  records. They know who's running this and
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:06.760]  I would imagine it's probably through the same
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:08.760]  Soros Group that funds Black Lives Matter
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:10.760]  because it's always the same group. We've gotten
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:12.760]  more documents before. We know it's usually
[1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:14.760]  Alexander Soros that is financing things.
[1:12:14.760 --> 1:12:16.760]  I would say that's the main suspect.
[1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:18.760]  But we really appreciate you.
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:20.760]  We really appreciate you coming on and talking about your brother
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.760]  John James. Stay there.
[1:12:22.760 --> 1:12:24.760]  I want to come back and talk about
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:26.760]  civilized awakening and what you're doing
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:28.760]  and what you think the next steps are going to be
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:30.760]  by Antifa, by BLM and
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:32.760]  folks out there allied with the Boogaloo's
[1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:34.760]  who are accelerationist
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  and say they want a armed
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:38.760]  revolution and who bragged that they helped
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:40.760]  invade the capital but haven't gotten any trouble.
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:42.760]  Okay. We'll be right back.
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:44.760]  Stay with us.
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:50.760]  Cognitive dissonance
[1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:52.760]  is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:54.760]  It can be very stressful
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:56.760]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:12:58.760]  If you have a family member
[1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:00.760]  suffering from this degenerative
[1:13:00.760 --> 1:13:02.760]  mental condition, buy them a bottle
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:04.760]  of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:06.760]  Studies have suggested
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:08.760]  that fish oils and fish oil
[1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:10.760]  supplementation can
[1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:12.760]  slightly lower blood pressure,
[1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:14.760]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:16.760]  decrease the growth rate of plaque
[1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:18.760]  and provide a soothing reduction
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:20.760]  in inflammatory responses
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:22.760]  in joints and the digestive system.
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:24.760]  Recent studies have suggested
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:26.760]  that high EPA and DHA
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:28.760]  fish oil can stimulate
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:30.760]  immune function by increasing
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:32.760]  the concentration and activity
[1:13:32.760 --> 1:13:34.760]  of immune cells.
[1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:36.760]  It worked for my family
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:38.760]  and now I can have a logical
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:40.760]  and calm discussion about actual facts
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:42.760]  that pertain to reality.
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:44.760]  Get your ultimate fish oil
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:46.760]  for a friend, family member, or yourself
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:48.760]  at infowarsstore.com.
[1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:50.760]  Three, two, one.
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:14:16.760]  Here we go.
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:42.760]  Here we go.
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:15:08.760]  Here we go.
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:10.760]  I am a shotgun rider
[1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:12.760]  for the San Jacinto Line.
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:14.760]  The desert is my brother.
[1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:16.760]  My skin is cracked and dry.
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:18.760]  I was riding on a folk coast
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:20.760]  and everything was fine
[1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:22.760]  till we took a shorter road
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:24.760]  to save some time.
[1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:26.760]  By the way, why are the flags
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:28.760]  in half-mast all over the country?
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:30.760]  Is it for the one police officer
[1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:32.760]  died of a stroke, a heart attack?
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:34.760]  They may have wounded me,
[1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:36.760]  but they'll never get the best
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:38.760]  of better...
[1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:40.760]  The 5,000 federal troops sent
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:42.760]  when Martin Luther King was killed
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:44.760]  when they burned Washington, D.C., the ground.
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:46.760]  For decades to rebuild it.
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:48.760]  You got four people dead
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:50.760]  and they're acting like it's the end of the world.
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:15:52.760]  It's now over 30,000 troops,
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:54.760]  regular army, and under national guard.
[1:15:54.760 --> 1:15:56.760]  40,000 police officers,
[1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:58.760]  martial law throughout the city.
[1:15:58.760 --> 1:16:00.760]  Our reporters are there.
[1:16:00.760 --> 1:16:02.760]  We're showing you some of this incredible footage.
[1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:04.760]  You're a TV viewer. We're, of course, simulcast
[1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:06.760]  on hundreds of radio stations.
[1:16:06.760 --> 1:16:08.760]  But then I have zero hedge right here
[1:16:08.760 --> 1:16:10.760]  with a powerful article with all the tweets
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:12.760]  from the Boogaloo saying,
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:14.760]  we went in, we attacked the capital,
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:16.760]  we stormed it, we ran it.
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:18.760]  Well, I talked to witnesses that saw
[1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:20.760]  them do the same thing.
[1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:22.760]  And so this is obviously
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:24.760]  agitation propaganda, the Soviet term.
[1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:26.760]  Agile prop.
[1:16:26.760 --> 1:16:28.760]  This is Operation Thrust 2.0.
[1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:30.760]  James Sullivan, have you ever heard
[1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.760]  about false flags or...
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:34.760]  Hitler did it to blame his enemies?
[1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:36.760]  The leftists do it too?
[1:16:36.760 --> 1:16:38.760]  You've...
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:40.760]  So you have heard about false flags?
[1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:42.760]  Yes, I have.
[1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:44.760]  Because your brother helped pull off
[1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:46.760]  a really good one.
[1:16:46.760 --> 1:16:48.760]  Obviously, he says, let's burn this mother
[1:16:48.760 --> 1:16:50.760]  effort down over and over again.
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:52.760]  He said he was going to come there with antifreeze
[1:16:52.760 --> 1:16:54.760]  like Proud Boys. That's pretty sophisticated.
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:56.760]  Do you have any idea who's training him
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:58.760]  or where he got this?
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:00.760]  I do know that when he originally started
[1:17:00.760 --> 1:17:02.760]  off here in Utah, there was a man by the name
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:04.760]  of Ariel Paz,
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:06.760]  who was actually...
[1:17:06.760 --> 1:17:08.760]  He was from Syria. John did go to Syria,
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:10.760]  but this man was from Syria.
[1:17:10.760 --> 1:17:12.760]  And he came in, he trained not only John,
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:14.760]  but a couple of other members of the
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:16.760]  Wastash and Tifa group.
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.760]  And I do know that
[1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:20.760]  he was one of the people responsible
[1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:22.760]  for radicalizing John, because people
[1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:24.760]  don't really regard this, but John
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:26.760]  was actually growing up.
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:28.760]  He was conservative. I think I know that
[1:17:28.760 --> 1:17:30.760]  he voted for Trump the first time around
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:32.760]  when he radicalized after George
[1:17:32.760 --> 1:17:34.760]  Floyd was killed. And then after that,
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:36.760]  he turned into somebody that myself,
[1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:38.760]  my parents and his friends couldn't recognize.
[1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:40.760]  And one of the first thing that I've seen
[1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:42.760]  in Tifa members do is they start denouncing
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:44.760]  people in their lives.
[1:17:44.760 --> 1:17:46.760]  He started denouncing that my father, John J. Sullivan,
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:48.760]  not to be confused as Kevin Sullivan,
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:50.760]  the person that people are saying is my dad,
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:52.760]  but John J. Sullivan, he's white.
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:54.760]  So my brother
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:56.760]  redefined himself as Joquan King.
[1:17:56.760 --> 1:17:58.760]  And he started like
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:00.760]  taking his history and raising people in his life
[1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:02.760]  that were conservative growing up.
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:06.760]  You've got a lot of information
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:08.760]  on this.
[1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:10.760]  What do you think is going to come out in court
[1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:12.760]  about your brother?
[1:18:12.760 --> 1:18:14.760]  I think a lot is going to come out in court.
[1:18:14.760 --> 1:18:16.760]  There's been a lot of people that have been
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:18.760]  writing and a lot of people that have been
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:20.760]  sending information to me,
[1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:22.760]  information that he's worked with
[1:18:22.760 --> 1:18:24.760]  a lone proud boy that's actually from
[1:18:24.760 --> 1:18:26.760]  Utah.
[1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:28.760]  He's on his way out
[1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:30.760]  of the proud boy group
[1:18:30.760 --> 1:18:32.760]  here in Utah.
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:34.760]  The president of the draft has been notified,
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:36.760]  but he passed on a proprietary
[1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:38.760]  information from
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:40.760]  private Patriot Telegram chats
[1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:42.760]  enabling in Tifa
[1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:44.760]  to infiltrate meetup
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:46.760]  points to go to the Capitol.
[1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:48.760]  So they wouldn't be seen as
[1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:50.760]  people that were being embedded by the Patriots,
[1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:52.760]  but as actual Patriots.
[1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:54.760]  So they were even able to penetrate
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:56.760]  the proud boys and others even get into their group.
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.760]  That's sophisticated.
[1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:00.760]  Yeah, it is.
[1:19:00.760 --> 1:19:02.760]  And John, again, is one of those villains that puts
[1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:04.760]  all the evidence up and it's the caravan
[1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:06.760]  points that was screen-shotted from
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.760]  the Telegram group that was sent to him.
[1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:10.760]  He put up on his Twitter
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:12.760]  or the Jaden Twitter.
[1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:16.760]  But that's what I think
[1:19:16.760 --> 1:19:18.760]  is going to come out.
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:20.760]  I think there's
[1:19:20.760 --> 1:19:22.760]  his arrest is going to
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:24.760]  lead to at least four more
[1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:26.760]  before other people that were associated
[1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:28.760]  with him. I do want to mention that the blonde girl
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:30.760]  that's seen the video right there, her name is Jade
[1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:32.760]  Sacker. She's been
[1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:34.760]  claimed or she's been painted
[1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:36.760]  as a CNN reporter.
[1:19:36.760 --> 1:19:38.760]  She's actually an investigative reporter.
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:40.760]  She's on work in Syria and Cambodia
[1:19:40.760 --> 1:19:42.760]  and
[1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:44.760]  she came back to the US and she was assigned
[1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:46.760]  the project with myself and John.
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:48.760]  So she's had to go and fake, just like
[1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:50.760]  investigative reporters do, a false
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:52.760]  friendship with my brother in order to get
[1:19:52.760 --> 1:19:54.760]  information out of him. So she has even
[1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:56.760]  more confidential information
[1:19:56.760 --> 1:19:58.760]  that
[1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:00.760]  a lot of people don't have because she's been able
[1:20:00.760 --> 1:20:02.760]  to gain my brother's trust. I just wanted to clear that
[1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:04.760]  up. But she is amazing.
[1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:06.760]  I've had the opportunity
[1:20:06.760 --> 1:20:08.760]  to work with her and she's done a lot.
[1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:10.760]  Do you ever think these international reporters that are
[1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:12.760]  doing all this and handling your brother
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:14.760]  ever thought they might be working for an intelligence
[1:20:14.760 --> 1:20:16.760]  agency, buddy, because she fits the cut out of that?
[1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:18.760]  I
[1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:20.760]  do know,
[1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:22.760]  I do know that, but with Jade
[1:20:22.760 --> 1:20:24.760]  she's never
[1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:26.760]  given me any reason to believe that.
[1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:28.760]  She might be, I'm not sure.
[1:20:28.760 --> 1:20:30.760]  No, I'm not accusing her of that. I was just asking
[1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:32.760]  you because clearly
[1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:34.760]  your brother and others are being handled by
[1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:36.760]  groups within the fed. Southern Parvy Law Center
[1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:38.760]  tribes. So Southern Parvy Law Center that
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:40.760]  basically ran the Oklahoma City bombing. They controlled
[1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:42.760]  McVay, they controlled Elohim City.
[1:20:42.760 --> 1:20:44.760]  That all actually came out from
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:46.760]  governments and federal court cases.
[1:20:46.760 --> 1:20:48.760]  And so they've had very ambitious
[1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:50.760]  terror plans in the U.S.
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:52.760]  before and they're usually the prime suspect.
[1:20:52.760 --> 1:20:54.760]  They've got billions in offshore accounts
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:20:56.760]  in the Caribbean.
[1:20:56.760 --> 1:20:58.760]  And so I'm just saying from past operations
[1:20:58.760 --> 1:21:00.760]  I would say the
[1:21:00.760 --> 1:21:02.760]  leftist arms and the CIA and FBI don't want to
[1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:04.760]  act directly with these people. They'll have
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:06.760]  informants that help handle them, others that
[1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:08.760]  post as journalists that help handle them.
[1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:10.760]  Then they'll be run by Southern Parvy Law
[1:21:10.760 --> 1:21:12.760]  Center deep cover operatives.
[1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:14.760]  They also use foreign intelligence
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:16.760]  so that our Congress
[1:21:16.760 --> 1:21:18.760]  doesn't find out about it. They use German intelligence
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:20.760]  on Oklahoma City to actually carry out the bombing
[1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:22.760]  itself. We know the name of the bomber.
[1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:24.760]  Yeah.
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:26.760]  Pretty crazy stuff, huh?
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:28.760]  It is pretty crazy stuff. Yeah.
[1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:30.760]  I honestly couldn't tell you if you're sitting
[1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:32.760]  here right now combating
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:34.760]  John growing up. He just wasn't that person.
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:36.760]  No, I hear you. So
[1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:38.760]  George Floyd
[1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:40.760]  what died like a year ago or so?
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:42.760]  Yeah, supposedly died. Yeah.
[1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:44.760]  Yeah. So your brother
[1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:46.760]  got accelerated that fast
[1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:48.760]  into being this radical?
[1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.760]  He's not the only conservative that I
[1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:52.760]  know. The mainstream media
[1:21:52.760 --> 1:21:54.760]  Black Lives Matter has been able to radicalize
[1:21:54.760 --> 1:21:56.760]  a lot of my friends, especially
[1:21:56.760 --> 1:21:58.760]  over in New York where I grew up.
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:00.760]  I had a conservative friends that were radicalized
[1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:02.760]  into believing that cops were killing
[1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:04.760]  black people at a
[1:22:04.760 --> 1:22:06.760]  genocidal rate despite the fact that
[1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:08.760]  the gun deaths for cops
[1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:10.760]  account for 0.02%
[1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:12.760]  of, you know, black
[1:22:12.760 --> 1:22:14.760]  death when, you know, you know what's going
[1:22:14.760 --> 1:22:16.760]  on in Chicago where 284 people
[1:22:16.760 --> 1:22:18.760]  were being shot over like
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:20.760]  July
[1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:22.760]  4th and
[1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:24.760]  Memorial Day weekend, but
[1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:26.760]  they they perceived that they it's like
[1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:28.760]  it's like the media was able to indoctrinate
[1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:30.760]  them to the point that facts and logic didn't
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:32.760]  matter anymore. It was almost hard to
[1:22:32.760 --> 1:22:34.760]  communicate with them. I will say that John
[1:22:34.760 --> 1:22:36.760]  was an extremely intelligent person
[1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:38.760]  and upon talking to him
[1:22:38.760 --> 1:22:40.760]  a couple months ago in that room for an hour
[1:22:40.760 --> 1:22:42.760]  he wasn't able to put together a
[1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:44.760]  coherent statement
[1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:46.760]  past a minute. It was like he couldn't focus
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:48.760]  on it. So that's very consistent with a lot
[1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:50.760]  of people that are in this group.
[1:22:50.760 --> 1:22:52.760]  You think your brother's been put on drugs
[1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:54.760]  by anybody because he looks pretty whacked out these photos?
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.760]  Yeah, yeah
[1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:58.760]  the only information that I do
[1:22:58.760 --> 1:23:00.760]  have is that he does have an addiction
[1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:02.760]  to Adderall and I got that from a couple
[1:23:02.760 --> 1:23:04.760]  of people that were associated with him that distance
[1:23:04.760 --> 1:23:06.760]  themselves after realizing who he was
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:08.760]  here in Utah and they said that he has a problem
[1:23:08.760 --> 1:23:10.760]  with that and it makes sense because empathy
[1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:12.760]  is something that's very hard to acquire
[1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:14.760]  when you are overusing
[1:23:14.760 --> 1:23:16.760]  or misusing Adderall.
[1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:18.760]  Wow, I want to just
[1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:20.760]  do a few more minutes because you're on the other side
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:22.760]  about your brother and a few other questions James Sullivan
[1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:24.760]  we really appreciate you. His brother's John Sullivan
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:26.760]  the Antifa Superman
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:28.760]  BLM guy that
[1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:30.760]  has
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:32.760]  popped up on Anderson Cooper and came in saying we're gonna burn
[1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:34.760]  this down and was there when Ashley
[1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:36.760]  Babbit was killed and
[1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:38.760]  said his mission was to pose as the proud boys
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:40.760]  and pose as the Patriots and do this
[1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:42.760]  and he had a stunning victory against America now
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:44.760]  we're all blamed for it and America's doing under
[1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:46.760]  total tyranny. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:48.760]  The Pope came out yesterday
[1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:50.760]  and announced a global government corporate
[1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:52.760]  alliance to redistribute wealth
[1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:54.760]  and create a planetary universal
[1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:56.760]  income which of course the United Nations
[1:23:56.760 --> 1:23:58.760]  and global corporations will control through
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:00.760]  the apps on your phone and finally a chip under
[1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:02.760]  your skin. It's all now completely
[1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:04.760]  official part of the
[1:24:04.760 --> 1:24:06.760]  UN great reset of the Davos
[1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:08.760]  Group and Cloud Schwab
[1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:10.760]  all officially written about in hundreds of books
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:12.760]  by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:14.760]  all the rest of them at 10 to 21 to 20
[1:24:14.760 --> 1:24:16.760]  30 gets here and only gets
[1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:18.760]  worse like being fed into a wood chipper
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:20.760]  or a meat grinder until you reject
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:22.760]  it all.
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:24.760]  And the rejection starts with
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:26.760]  realizing it's spiritual battle, good first
[1:24:26.760 --> 1:24:28.760]  evil and stopping
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:30.760]  abortion. We must start
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:32.760]  value human life again. We must start
[1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:34.760]  saying that we are not expendable
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:36.760]  that we are not disposable
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:38.760]  that we are essential
[1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:40.760]  until we do that we are all slaves
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:42.760]  we must stand up
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:44.760]  and declare our basic God-given human rights
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:46.760]  now.

[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:14.760]  Jim Morrison
[1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:16.760]  studied how to trigger
[1:27:16.760 --> 1:27:18.760]  riots
[1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:20.760]  and how to carry out
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:22.760]  algebra
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:24.760]  and he went to college
[1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:26.760]  and then suddenly
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:28.760]  he decided
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:30.760]  to start a rock band
[1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:32.760]  his dad was the head
[1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:34.760]  of the
[1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:36.760]  civic fleet in
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:38.760]  Vietnam
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:44.760]  very interesting
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:46.760]  a lot of that going on
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:48.760]  in government people studying
[1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:50.760]  how to trigger riots
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:52.760]  how to blame their political enemies
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:54.760]  but John Sullivan
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:56.760]  is a key character there are
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:27:58.760]  other key characters
[1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:00.760]  that have to be
[1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:02.760]  looked at as well
[1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:04.760]  and one of the best articles is
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:06.760]  Zero Outro
[1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:08.760]  and one of the best articles is
[1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:10.760]  Zero Hedge
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:12.760]  yesterday because it's a big long article
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:14.760]  with 20 pages of it
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:16.760]  with the bogeloo
[1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:18.760]  top people taking credit
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:20.760]  for storming the capital
[1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:22.760]  and I guess they saw this as a great
[1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:24.760]  protest or something
[1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.760]  a woman got killed a cop had a
[1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:28.760]  vaneurism
[1:28:28.760 --> 1:28:30.760]  other folks got trampled okay four dead
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:32.760]  and now we've got the biggest military
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:34.760]  takeover
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:36.760]  of DC in our history
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:38.760]  this is shameful
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:40.760]  it's disgusting to see martial law there
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:42.760]  it's about the power structure saying
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.760]  we own America and you populists
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:46.760]  aren't going to stop us the counseling
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:48.760]  farm relations has come out
[1:28:48.760 --> 1:28:50.760]  and said
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:52.760]  that American democracy
[1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:54.760]  is in danger because of populism
[1:28:56.760 --> 1:28:58.760]  that's like saying someone's going to
[1:28:58.760 --> 1:29:00.760]  exfixiate
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:02.760]  from no oxygen because there's too much
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:04.760]  oxygen populism
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:06.760]  is the democracy
[1:29:06.760 --> 1:29:08.760]  in fact it could be dangerous sometimes
[1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:10.760]  if a dictator manipulates it
[1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:12.760]  you have a popular dictator and democracy
[1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:14.760]  can do bad things while we're not a pure democracy
[1:29:14.760 --> 1:29:16.760]  we're a constitutional republic
[1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:18.760]  but I wanted to finish up
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:20.760]  I appreciate coming on brother of
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:22.760]  this individual John Sullivan
[1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:24.760]  to come on at any other points
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:26.760]  he'd like to impart to the viewers and listeners
[1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:30.760]  other points about John or just in general
[1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:32.760]  you sound like a smart guy
[1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:34.760]  you were going over those statistics of the rarest way to die
[1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:36.760]  as a black man is from the cops
[1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:38.760]  the average young black person
[1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:40.760]  thinks there's an epidemic
[1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:42.760]  there's a lot of these things that are important
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:44.760]  I do see that
[1:29:44.760 --> 1:29:46.760]  especially in my brother's case
[1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:48.760]  how strong and how
[1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:50.760]  powerful the mainstream media is
[1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:52.760]  especially with the black community
[1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:54.760]  I feel like
[1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:56.760]  in the black community
[1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:58.760]  mostly in democratic health cities
[1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:00.760]  the black community
[1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:02.760]  is being led to believe that the current republic
[1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:04.760]  or the U.S.
[1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:06.760]  today
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.760]  is failing them in order for them to be truly equal
[1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:10.760]  as socialism says on paper
[1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:12.760]  they need socialism to replace that
[1:30:12.760 --> 1:30:14.760]  they radicalized
[1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:16.760]  a civil rights
[1:30:16.760 --> 1:30:18.760]  narrative
[1:30:18.760 --> 1:30:20.760]  to force that narrative
[1:30:20.760 --> 1:30:22.760]  of equality through socialism
[1:30:22.760 --> 1:30:24.760]  we saw
[1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:26.760]  black lives matter
[1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:28.760]  take advantage of the black community
[1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:30.760]  perverting the message of equality
[1:30:30.760 --> 1:30:32.760]  and
[1:30:32.760 --> 1:30:34.760]  in doing so it's a meaning
[1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:36.760]  Caucasian Americans
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:38.760]  and creating division that we haven't seen
[1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:40.760]  since the civil rights era
[1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:42.760]  this is a lot worse than
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:44.760]  the Michael Brown
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:46.760]  or the Ferguson
[1:30:46.760 --> 1:30:48.760]  era of black lives matter
[1:30:48.760 --> 1:30:50.760]  we're seeing
[1:30:50.760 --> 1:30:52.760]  families like mine being torn apart
[1:30:52.760 --> 1:30:54.760]  we're seeing indoctrination on levels
[1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:56.760]  that these people actually think
[1:30:56.760 --> 1:30:58.760]  in a space of two months that
[1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:00.760]  they are fighting for the equality
[1:31:00.760 --> 1:31:02.760]  of
[1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:04.760]  their black brothers and sisters
[1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:06.760]  we're seeing white people bowing down
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:08.760]  to
[1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:10.760]  their black
[1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:12.760]  brothers and sisters
[1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:14.760]  to apologize for things that they didn't do
[1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:16.760]  this is something that's very serious
[1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:18.760]  because it's creating a victim
[1:31:18.760 --> 1:31:20.760]  mentality within the black community
[1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:22.760]  that makes them
[1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:24.760]  usable as a
[1:31:24.760 --> 1:31:26.760]  political weapon for the radical left
[1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:28.760]  we've seen that they were able to weaponize them
[1:31:30.760 --> 1:31:32.760]  after a black man was killed on TV
[1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:34.760]  they were able to weaponize them
[1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:36.760]  a week after Biden
[1:31:36.760 --> 1:31:38.760]  went on and said
[1:31:38.760 --> 1:31:40.760]  that
[1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:42.760]  if you don't vote for him you ain't black
[1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:44.760]  on the breakfast club
[1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:46.760]  we've seen it's very concerning
[1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:48.760]  watching that and seeing people
[1:31:48.760 --> 1:31:50.760]  like my brother
[1:31:50.760 --> 1:31:52.760]  absolutely lost now
[1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:54.760]  the devoid of logic
[1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:56.760]  just attached to his radical ideas
[1:31:58.760 --> 1:32:00.760]  so much that he doesn't even understand
[1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:02.760]  what he believes unless the media tells him
[1:32:02.760 --> 1:32:04.760]  what to believe
[1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:06.760]  it's something that's very sad
[1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:08.760]  but what civilized awakening
[1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:10.760]  did when we came out is we actually
[1:32:10.760 --> 1:32:12.760]  combated Lex Scott
[1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:14.760]  who is the leader
[1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:16.760]  of Black Lives Matter Utah after we took down
[1:32:16.760 --> 1:32:18.760]  John and we actually challenged
[1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:20.760]  the narrative
[1:32:20.760 --> 1:32:22.760]  we're able to not rehabilitate
[1:32:22.760 --> 1:32:24.760]  but to turn a lot of minds within Black Lives Matter Utah
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:26.760]  she has
[1:32:26.760 --> 1:32:28.760]  several times come out
[1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:30.760]  and said that she's not affiliated with
[1:32:30.760 --> 1:32:32.760]  John I don't think that she should
[1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:34.760]  lead herself to anything other than a psychiatric
[1:32:34.760 --> 1:32:36.760]  facility
[1:32:36.760 --> 1:32:38.760]  to be evaluated
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:40.760]  but she and Black Lives Matter Utah were not affiliated
[1:32:40.760 --> 1:32:42.760]  with him they started denouncing him
[1:32:42.760 --> 1:32:44.760]  immediately
[1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:46.760]  and seeing John go through this
[1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:48.760]  and going through this downward spiral
[1:32:48.760 --> 1:32:50.760]  after being charged
[1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:52.760]  with inciting violence and rioting and provo
[1:32:52.760 --> 1:32:54.760]  seeing him do it again
[1:32:54.760 --> 1:32:56.760]  this time facing federal charges
[1:32:56.760 --> 1:32:58.760]  and versing
[1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:00.760]  the people of the United States
[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:02.760]  in court
[1:33:02.760 --> 1:33:04.760]  it's something that he's never going to be able to let down
[1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:06.760]  or erase
[1:33:06.760 --> 1:33:08.760]  I do think at this point he's hit rock bottom
[1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:10.760]  and hopefully
[1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:12.760]  with the mental
[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:14.760]  evaluation that's been mandated by the court
[1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:16.760]  of Tula County
[1:33:16.760 --> 1:33:18.760]  that we find out some things that have happened to him
[1:33:18.760 --> 1:33:20.760]  with this indoctrination
[1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:22.760]  well James Sullivan I'm impressed
[1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:24.760]  with you
[1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:26.760]  and I really wish your brother had not gone down this
[1:33:26.760 --> 1:33:28.760]  dangerous path but
[1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:30.760]  he's got some really evil people manipulating him
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:32.760]  and this is the
[1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:34.760]  really the crisis not just of our time but of
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:36.760]  much of human history is not
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:38.760]  faced the level of manipulation
[1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:40.760]  that big tech and others can engage in and closing
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:42.760]  what do you make
[1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:44.760]  I'm not saying get rid of his twitter account
[1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:46.760]  I know people have a free speech right
[1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:48.760]  but
[1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:50.760]  he's on there really calling for revolution
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:52.760]  and violence we now know he is so that's why
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:54.760]  it's a good thing we can see what he's up to
[1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:56.760]  but other people are being banned for nothing
[1:33:56.760 --> 1:33:58.760]  off of there or for just
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:00.760]  being
[1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:02.760]  pro-second amendment
[1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:04.760]  and then here's your brother now charged twice in this
[1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:06.760]  and they've still got him up there
[1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:08.760]  recruiting it shows it's really a double standard
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:10.760]  yeah the only things
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:12.760]  that they're taking down is incriminating
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:14.760]  evidence of him a lot of videos
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:16.760]  have mysteriously disappeared from his twitter
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:18.760]  no longer accessible
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:20.760]  we've also seen this is something
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:22.760]  that's not really talked about because of john's involvement
[1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:24.760]  and
[1:34:24.760 --> 1:34:26.760]  at the capitol and the infiltration
[1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:28.760]  of the patriots influencer
[1:34:28.760 --> 1:34:30.760]  by the name of
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:32.760]  Cache Lee Kelly
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:34.760]  who is a strong black conservative
[1:34:34.760 --> 1:34:36.760]  who was known for just like I am
[1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:38.760]  turning the hearts of black lies
[1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:40.760]  matter in his cities he has over like
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:42.760]  600,000 followers
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:44.760]  he was arrested for being
[1:34:44.760 --> 1:34:46.760]  waved in by the capitol police
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:48.760]  into the front doors
[1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:50.760]  and he's facing a prison sentence
[1:34:50.760 --> 1:34:52.760]  he's been separated from his four kids
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:54.760]  because people like my brother have been indoctrinated
[1:34:54.760 --> 1:34:56.760]  by the mainstream media
[1:34:56.760 --> 1:34:58.760]  I'm not saying that
[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:00.760]  he's doing this
[1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:02.760]  purely because of indoctrination
[1:35:02.760 --> 1:35:04.760]  I think that there's a part of him
[1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:06.760]  that generally believes in what he's doing
[1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:08.760]  because he hasn't stopped
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:10.760]  he feels
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:12.760]  he has the
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:14.760]  mentality of a victim
[1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:16.760]  and we're seeing patriots and conservatives
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:18.760]  getting silence off of
[1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:20.760]  facebook and twitter
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.760]  I do think that the capitol event was
[1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:24.760]  a way of
[1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:26.760]  painting the patriots
[1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:28.760]  and republicans as domestic
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:30.760]  terrorists just like we saw in Tifa
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:32.760]  when their accounts were removed from facebook
[1:35:32.760 --> 1:35:34.760]  it was an excuse to
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:36.760]  censor completely censor
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:38.760]  conservative voices off of facebook
[1:35:40.760 --> 1:35:42.760]  and it's something that
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:44.760]  people aren't or are just now
[1:35:44.760 --> 1:35:46.760]  coming attuned to
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:48.760]  James Sullivan, people can find you on facebook
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:50.760]  at Civilized Awakening
[1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:52.760]  Civilized Awakening
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:54.760]  James Sullivan, hopefully as this unfolds
[1:35:54.760 --> 1:35:56.760]  we can get some updates from you
[1:35:56.760 --> 1:35:58.760]  and thank you so much
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:00.760]  and thank you for spending time with us
[1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:02.760]  sir, you too, thank you
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:04.760]  Alright, powerful interview
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:06.760]  very articulate, smart, good young man
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:08.760]  and it really shows the
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:10.760]  Cain and Abel type story
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:12.760]  about two brothers
[1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:14.760]  and go two really separate, dramatic
[1:36:14.760 --> 1:36:16.760]  directions
[1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:18.760]  but we are under martial law ladies and gentlemen
[1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:20.760]  and they are planning
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:22.760]  they say terror attacks are coming tomorrow
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:24.760]  the globalist stand to gain from this
[1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:26.760]  and we just got set up in this false flag
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:28.760]  and so that's why I've said
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:30.760]  it's not good to go out and demonstrate right now
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:32.760]  because they need crowds to be able to hide their actions
[1:36:32.760 --> 1:36:34.760]  I'm all for demonstrating
[1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:36.760]  as soon as we're through this crisis
[1:36:36.760 --> 1:36:38.760]  you decide what you're going to do, I've just put my two cents in
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:40.760]  or we got a bunch of breaking news
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:42.760]  and more and Nick Fuentes joining us
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:37:08.760]  we'll be right back
[1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:14.760]  and that's it for today
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:16.760]  I hope you enjoyed this video

[1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:12.760]  we're back to Civil Computers
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:14.760]  they're turning us into a commodity
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:16.760]  human animal clones have been around for 50 years
[1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:18.760]  it's all being announced
[1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:20.760]  they are literally taking over the life cycle of humans
[1:38:20.760 --> 1:38:22.760]  and making us obsolete
[1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:24.760]  and big corporations downplay that they own us
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:26.760]  with these gene therapy systems
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:28.760]  and patents that they produced
[1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:30.760]  do you understand it is a takeover
[1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:32.760]  of the entire species of the genetic level
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:34.760]  and now they're coming with dog callers
[1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:36.760]  and they're announcing in public schools in the US
[1:38:36.760 --> 1:38:38.760]  starting next year it will begin
[1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:40.760]  did you hear me?
[1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:42.760]  dog callers for your children all based on a hoax
[1:38:42.760 --> 1:38:44.760]  all based on a lie
[1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:46.760]  implore wars continue to spread the word to fight back
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:52.760]  ladies and gentlemen I've studied history
[1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:54.760]  I've interviewed all the experts
[1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:56.760]  I have looked at every facet of this
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:38:58.760]  and now only days until
[1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:00.760]  the inauguration of the chai kong agent
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:02.760]  it's all coming into place
[1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:04.760]  that's how they change the subject from election fraud
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:06.760]  it's how they change the subject from hunters laptop
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:08.760]  it's how they change the subject from
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:10.760]  Epstein and Obama
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:12.760]  and al-qaeda and the new world order
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:14.760]  and now use the already
[1:39:14.760 --> 1:39:16.760]  martial law in place for COVID-19
[1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:18.760]  and that's what it is
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:20.760]  to then be expanded and become political
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:22.760]  and become permanent
[1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:24.760]  they train you to stay in your houses
[1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:26.760]  they train you to be tracked
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:28.760]  they train you to do what you're told
[1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:30.760]  for 9, 10 months of training wheels
[1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:32.760]  and now they launch the storm
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:34.760]  the storm is here
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:36.760]  martial law for Trump
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:38.760]  there's been martial law for the globalist
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:40.760]  they're trying to set you up
[1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:42.760]  don't be involved in violence
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:44.760]  expose the new world order
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:46.760]  and expose the takeover with information
[1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:48.760]  that's how we beat these people
[1:39:48.760 --> 1:40:06.760]  the resistance.video
[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:08.760]  and hundreds of other URLs we've launched
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:10.760]  have been banned
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:12.760]  that's why every month we launch
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:14.760]  a new URL
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:16.760]  before they ban it
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:18.760]  but Soros and Bill Gates
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:20.760]  and the globalists are on our tail
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:22.760]  but the new website
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:24.760]  is the resistance.video
[1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:26.760]  the resistance.video
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:28.760]  they're trying to block us
[1:40:28.760 --> 1:40:30.760]  because the truth is powerful
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:32.760]  and can defeat them
[1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:34.760]  so the new URL that links right to banned.video
[1:40:34.760 --> 1:40:36.760]  and all of our videos
[1:40:36.760 --> 1:40:38.760]  and all of our documentaries and all the special reports
[1:40:38.760 --> 1:40:40.760]  and all the suppressed information
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:42.760]  is it the resistance.video
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:44.760]  share the link
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:46.760]  the resistance.video
[1:40:46.760 --> 1:41:12.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:20.760]  music
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:22.760]  I want to be yours pretty baby
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:24.760]  yours and yours alone
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:26.760]  I'm here to tell you honey
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:28.760]  but I'm bad at the bone
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:30.760]  buh buh buh bad at the bone
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:42.760]  music
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:44.760]  the bad at the bone
[1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:46.760]  alright that's enough
[1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:48.760]  let's uh
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:50.760]  talk about the real news that's going on here
[1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:52.760]  the real news ladies and gentlemen
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:54.760]  the real information
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:56.760]  I can talk about a hundred articles I've got
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:58.760]  dozens of incredible clips
[1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:00.760]  but this is world government takeover
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:02.760]  this is bigger than America
[1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:04.760]  it's bigger than Trump
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:06.760]  we've come so far exposing globalism
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:08.760]  we have the Australian and British
[1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:10.760]  government saying we don't want the great
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:12.760]  reset but the prime minister saying
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:14.760]  he does want it in the UK
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:16.760]  you've got a lot of big issues
[1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:18.760]  now being openly debated
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:20.760]  instead of all this side window dressing
[1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:22.760]  and so that's very positive
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:24.760]  Nick Feuentes is going to be joining us
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:26.760]  he's the founder of the Gropers
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:28.760]  a well-spoken smart
[1:42:28.760 --> 1:42:30.760]  young lad
[1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:32.760]  who from the quotes I've seen
[1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:34.760]  you don't want to see these are accurate in the news
[1:42:34.760 --> 1:42:36.760]  thinks what happened to the capital was grand
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:38.760]  so we'll get his perspective
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:40.760]  on that coming up but look at this
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:42.760]  headline right here I told you last week
[1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:44.760]  this was coming
[1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:46.760]  they're going to put all those troops in the capital
[1:42:46.760 --> 1:42:48.760]  and then say oh
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:50.760]  they're not trusted because of all the
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:52.760]  Q stuff
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:54.760]  some of them may actually believe it
[1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:56.760]  carry a coup out against Biden
[1:42:56.760 --> 1:42:58.760]  so this is the beginning of the purge in government
[1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:00.760]  just like the Bolsheviks did in 1917
[1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:02.760]  everything is following that same blueprint
[1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:06.760]  two National Guard members removed
[1:43:06.760 --> 1:43:08.760]  from inauguration
[1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:10.760]  security mission
[1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:12.760]  two Army National Guard members have been removed
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:14.760]  from the inauguration security mission
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:16.760]  after vetting found they had ties to far
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:18.760]  right wing friends groups
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:22.760]  the US official told ABC News Tuesday
[1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:24.760]  the two Guard members are among
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:26.760]  25,000 National Guard troops
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:28.760]  who have been sent to Washington to augment
[1:43:28.760 --> 1:43:30.760]  the security inauguration in the wake of the
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:32.760]  violent January 6th assault on the US capital
[1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:34.760]  but none of them even have
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:38.760]  bullets
[1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:40.760]  not just in their firearms not just in their magazines
[1:43:42.760 --> 1:43:44.760]  but with them
[1:43:44.760 --> 1:43:46.760]  when the Secretary of Defense under Obama
[1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.760]  would go to
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:50.760]  Afghanistan or Iraq they would take the
[1:43:50.760 --> 1:43:52.760]  cartridges away from everybody
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:54.760]  because they don't trust humans they want robots
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:43:58.760]  so all of this
[1:44:00.760 --> 1:44:02.760]  is just to train you
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:06.760]  to accept martial law
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:08.760]  and the military
[1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:12.760]  is the main target
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:14.760]  of these purges that are coming so everyone
[1:44:14.760 --> 1:44:16.760]  going along with this is an idiot
[1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:18.760]  Governor Abbott has said that this is happening
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:20.760]  to people from Texas is offensive
[1:44:22.760 --> 1:44:24.760]  very offensive
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:26.760]  not in offense like football
[1:44:26.760 --> 1:44:28.760]  or defense but offensive and it's on offense
[1:44:30.760 --> 1:44:32.760]  CNN's Cuomo warns of National Guard
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:34.760]  insider threat
[1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:36.760]  there is no
[1:44:36.760 --> 1:44:38.760]  peace that's right there's never going to be peace
[1:44:38.760 --> 1:44:40.760]  because you provocateur some antifa
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:42.760]  and some boogaloo booboos
[1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:46.760]  to go in there
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:48.760]  and the boogaloo's brag
[1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:50.760]  and the boogaloo's call up
[1:44:50.760 --> 1:44:52.760]  and say why are you being mean to the boogaloo's
[1:44:54.760 --> 1:44:56.760]  I don't agree with busting in there
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:44:58.760]  and breaking stuff and handing out clubs
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:00.760]  to people and how are you
[1:45:00.760 --> 1:45:02.760]  able to brag about that everybody else that was peaceful has been arrested
[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:04.760]  I mean just saying
[1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:06.760]  how about you guys take your mask off
[1:45:06.760 --> 1:45:08.760]  and you all put online your identities
[1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:10.760]  because I think we're going to find some FBI
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:12.760]  agents are in command
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:14.760]  not against the average boogaloo
[1:45:14.760 --> 1:45:16.760]  that thinks we should have a civil war
[1:45:16.760 --> 1:45:18.760]  or a revolution
[1:45:18.760 --> 1:45:20.760]  that's your opinion you can have it soldier
[1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:22.760]  but boy did you find a great target
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:24.760]  an empty capital
[1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:26.760]  and the boogaloo's all ran off
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:28.760]  after they helped get the doors open so
[1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:32.760]  that's why I'm on a boogaloo jag
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:34.760]  just like I'm on a
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:36.760]  John Sullivan Jag
[1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:38.760]  because we're being set up
[1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:42.760]  and I don't like it
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:44.760]  I was there for a peaceful demonstration
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:46.760]  we had a whole bunch of them before
[1:45:46.760 --> 1:45:48.760]  I was there to
[1:45:48.760 --> 1:45:50.760]  put legal lawful pressure on the Congress
[1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:52.760]  have a 10 day investigation of the fraud
[1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:54.760]  so our voting rights weren't stolen
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:58.760]  and I watched some accelerationist
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:04.760]  help ramp the crowd the police up into what happened
[1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:06.760]  wasn't the greatest insurrection ever seen
[1:46:06.760 --> 1:46:08.760]  it wasn't even that
[1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:10.760]  it was a small riot out of a huge
[1:46:10.760 --> 1:46:12.760]  group of people
[1:46:12.760 --> 1:46:14.760]  I know I'm harping on that but
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:16.760]  now you see the martial law
[1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:18.760]  and so many people can't believe this is happening
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:20.760]  they're like oh it's Q
[1:46:20.760 --> 1:46:22.760]  it's all secretly going to be fixed
[1:46:22.760 --> 1:46:24.760]  tomorrow
[1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:26.760]  they're all being arrested
[1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:28.760]  the military is there to arrest Pelosi
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:30.760]  and tomorrow
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:32.760]  like a hunger games movie
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:34.760]  where they're in those big squares
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:36.760]  and no one's there but troops
[1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:38.760]  just like China
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:40.760]  they can't trust anybody to be
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:42.760]  in North Korea or places like China
[1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:44.760]  that these big parades except the military
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:46.760]  because somebody might protest or say something
[1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:54.760]  and just like the hunger games there
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:56.760]  will be the leader
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:46:58.760]  of the main capital district
[1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:00.760]  you go to Jack Posovic's twitter for a few days ago
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:02.760]  he even has the villain
[1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:04.760]  and his wife
[1:47:04.760 --> 1:47:06.760]  looks just like Biden and Kamala Harris
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:08.760]  and there they are having one of his
[1:47:08.760 --> 1:47:10.760]  celebrations at the capital city
[1:47:10.760 --> 1:47:12.760]  and it looks just like the inauguration
[1:47:12.760 --> 1:47:14.760]  for Biden and Kamala Harris
[1:47:14.760 --> 1:47:16.760]  and they're going to be up there with the military
[1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:18.760]  and thousands and thousands
[1:47:18.760 --> 1:47:20.760]  of U.N. flags
[1:47:20.760 --> 1:47:22.760]  and American flags
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:24.760]  throwing it all in
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:26.760]  our face
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:28.760]  and we're supposed to just sit there
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:30.760]  and take it
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:32.760]  while they tell us that we're all terrorists
[1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:34.760]  so that's why we weren't allowed in
[1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:36.760]  oh we can't even trust the military
[1:47:36.760 --> 1:47:38.760]  they're bad too
[1:47:40.760 --> 1:47:42.760]  and then anybody says Joe Biden lost
[1:47:42.760 --> 1:47:44.760]  and stole the election while they're a terrorist
[1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:46.760]  and anybody that says he works for China
[1:47:46.760 --> 1:47:48.760]  they're a terrorist and now I'm seeing headlines about
[1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:50.760]  he was an incredible football player
[1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:52.760]  why Joe Biden's like a superhero
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:54.760]  why Joe Biden's such a humanitarian
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:56.760]  oh and
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:47:58.760]  I was in a
[1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:00.760]  art supply store for my kids the other day
[1:48:00.760 --> 1:48:02.760]  and they had magazines out
[1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:04.760]  with color covers
[1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:06.760]  of Kamala Harris the first
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:08.760]  vice president female
[1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:10.760]  and all these gimmicks
[1:48:12.760 --> 1:48:14.760]  it really is
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:16.760]  incredible
[1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.760]  we live in such amazing times
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:20.760]  where they're going to put this creature in there
[1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:22.760]  and so I don't want anything bad to happen
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:24.760]  if they don't turn him into a martyr
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:26.760]  but I do put a death pool on him
[1:48:26.760 --> 1:48:28.760]  a dead pool
[1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:30.760]  I don't think he's going to be dead
[1:48:30.760 --> 1:48:32.760]  in the next year
[1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:34.760]  but I
[1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:36.760]  I bet Biden
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:40.760]  he likes power though
[1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:42.760]  but they put him in there because he's so weak
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:44.760]  and so adult
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:46.760]  he's talked about stepping down, feigning and illness
[1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:48.760]  as a reason to go
[1:48:48.760 --> 1:48:50.760]  to a show and debate once we have
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:52.760]  our installed president, our first dictator
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:54.760]  with more troops in D.C. they've ever been there
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:56.760]  I mean it's here
[1:48:56.760 --> 1:48:58.760]  and people just can't believe
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:00.760]  that this has happened
[1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:02.760]  they can't believe it's actually unfolding
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:08.760]  and so
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:10.760]  a good 30-40% of the people that listen to my show
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:12.760]  who are great folks who are aware of the New World Order
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:14.760]  who are
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:16.760]  involved in society fighting back for freedom
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:18.760]  they just
[1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:20.760]  cannot believe this is happening and you know
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:22.760]  we're going to find out tomorrow at noon
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:24.760]  Eastern Time will be here live covering it
[1:49:24.760 --> 1:49:26.760]  whether or not he's all been arrested
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:28.760]  I imagine when Trump's down in Mar-a-Lago
[1:49:28.760 --> 1:49:30.760]  eating steaks and playing golf it'll be
[1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:32.760]  that's a hologram, Trump's still in D.C.
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:34.760]  they were all arrested
[1:49:34.760 --> 1:49:36.760]  and now we live under a secret military dictatorship
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:38.760]  well they're going to keep teaching your boys
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:40.760]  to be transgendered
[1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:42.760]  they're going to keep keeping the borders open
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:44.760]  they're going to keep doing their New World Order
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:46.760]  you know when there's a magic
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:48.760]  president Q in charge
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:50.760]  it's just a
[1:49:50.760 --> 1:49:52.760]  complex
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.760]  operation to fool the Chinese
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:56.760]  and actually Joe Biden's in Gitmo
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:00.760]  really really sad folks
[1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:02.760]  Trump did not get us here
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:04.760]  we got ourselves here putting Trump in
[1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:06.760]  we fought back a long ways
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:08.760]  so don't let the removal of Trump through fraud be a defeat
[1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:10.760]  they had to engage on all this
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:12.760]  and have a virtual ceremony
[1:50:12.760 --> 1:50:14.760]  and have a virtual law because they're a fraud
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:18.760]  and we were good citizens
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:20.760]  that went there to demonstrate for our voting rights
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:22.760]  and they set us up
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:24.760]  and they were successful
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:26.760]  but it's okay because the truth is coming out
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:28.760]  and people everywhere are learning about it
[1:50:28.760 --> 1:50:30.760]  Nick Foyntez is coming up just briefly

[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:40.760]  I want to warn all patriots in the United States
[1:52:40.760 --> 1:52:42.760]  and across the world that are listening to my voice
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:45.760]  I'm Alex Jones I've been in this fight 27 years
[1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:48.760]  and I've studied every angle of their operations
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:51.760]  and I'm here to tell you as clear as day
[1:52:51.760 --> 1:52:54.760]  they have organizations on message boards
[1:52:54.760 --> 1:52:57.760]  and other groups posing as patriot leaders
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:52:59.760]  and posing as President Trump
[1:52:59.760 --> 1:53:02.760]  anonymously telling you to have arm marches
[1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:05.760]  in all 50 states coming up on the 20th and before that
[1:53:05.760 --> 1:53:08.760]  you are being set up I was there in DC
[1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:10.760]  with a million peaceful people
[1:53:10.760 --> 1:53:12.760]  and I watched Antifa and other leftist groups
[1:53:12.760 --> 1:53:15.760]  pose as our people and set us up
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:18.760]  thank God the patriots did not engage in the rioting
[1:53:18.760 --> 1:53:21.760]  so only a few people did it so the thing was a
[1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:25.760]  misfire it was a dud but the left is hungry to declare
[1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:27.760]  all Trump supporters terrorist and they're planning
[1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:30.760]  terrorist attacks and mass shootings on the 20th
[1:53:30.760 --> 1:53:33.760]  to blame the American people do not be part of it
[1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:39.760]  we are peaceful we are not violent
[1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:46.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:53:46.760 --> 1:53:52.760]  did you know that there was a president
[1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:54.760]  that part of the domestic terrorist?
[1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:57.760]  that's right president part of the domestic terrorist
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:53:59.760]  the full report is at man dot video
[1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:00.760]  here's part of it
[1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:03.760]  hey did you know that a black lives matter
[1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:05.760]  associate bombed the U.S. capitol
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:07.760]  and the U.S. capitol
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:09.760]  and the U.S. capitol
[1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:11.760]  and the U.S. capitol
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:13.760]  and the U.S. capitol
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:15.760]  and the U.S. capitol
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:17.760]  and the U.S. capitol
[1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:18.760]  that's right
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:20.760]  you probably never heard about it
[1:54:20.760 --> 1:54:22.760]  now this was back in 1983
[1:54:22.760 --> 1:54:24.760]  but there is a direct link
[1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:29.760]  a close connection to today's black lives matter movement
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  I'm gonna tell you all about it
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:33.760]  on November 7th 1983
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:35.760]  a thunderous explosion
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:39.760]  tore through the second story of the U.S. capitol building
[1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:41.760]  after a bomb went off
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:43.760]  that was hidden under a bench
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:45.760]  right outside the chamber
[1:54:45.760 --> 1:54:48.760]  amazingly nobody was injured
[1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:50.760]  but the blast did do lots of damage
[1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.760]  it was estimated around a million dollars
[1:54:53.760 --> 1:54:55.760]  this is a KNBC news update
[1:54:55.760 --> 1:54:56.760]  here is John Beard
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:54:58.760]  good evening a bomb exploded tonight
[1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:01.760]  near the second floor office of U.S. Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:03.760]  Washington DC police said there were no injuries
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:04.760]  had no reports of damage
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:07.760]  police dogs are at the scene searching for possible clues
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:10.760]  the FBI searches for the terrorists
[1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:12.760]  who planted a bomb on capitol hill
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:14.760]  the Senate was in session tonight
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:16.760]  as the FBI continued its search for the bombers
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:18.760]  who detonated a powerful explosion
[1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:20.760]  just outside the Senate chambers
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:22.760]  in the capitol last night
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:23.760]  so who did it?
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:25.760]  the two people convicted of the terrorist attack
[1:55:25.760 --> 1:55:27.760]  were both women
[1:55:27.760 --> 1:55:30.760]  Linda Evans and Susan Rosenberg
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:32.760]  a pair of radical left commies
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:34.760]  who bombed the U.S. capitol
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:37.760]  in an attempt to assassinate Republican senators
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:40.760]  this is really an amazing story
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:44.760]  especially as it relates to today's Black Lives Matter movement
[1:55:44.760 --> 1:55:46.760]  and we'll get into that in just a second
[1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:48.760]  but first check this out
[1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:49.760]  these two women
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:52.760]  both far left revolutionaries
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:55.760]  were part of two separate terrorist groups
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:55:58.760]  one was called M-19
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:01.760]  the May 19th communist organization
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:03.760]  and the other was called the family
[1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  they were an offshoot of the Black Liberation Army
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:10.760]  whose leader was, get this
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:12.760]  Matula Doc Shakur
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:17.760]  the stepfather of hip-hop legend Tupac Shakur
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:20.760]  together they were responsible for a series
[1:56:20.760 --> 1:56:23.760]  of violent domestic terror attacks
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:25.760]  in the late 70s and early 80s
[1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:28.760]  that includes a bombing campaign
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:30.760]  that in addition to the U.S. capitol
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:32.760]  I mean they also targeted government buildings
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:34.760]  in Washington and New York
[1:56:34.760 --> 1:56:37.760]  they bombed an FBI office
[1:56:37.760 --> 1:56:39.760]  the Washington Navy Yard
[1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:43.760]  and the headquarters of New York's largest police union
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:45.760]  so these are two crazy bitches
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:48.760]  with a long history of violent extremism
[1:56:48.760 --> 1:56:50.760]  and when they weren't busy
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:52.760]  bombing buildings or targeting our police
[1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:54.760]  our military and our government
[1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:56.760]  they were out there robbing banks
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:56:58.760]  and armored trucks
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:01.760]  in fact there was one incident in October 1981
[1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:04.760]  where they killed a guard and two policemen
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:07.760]  during a Brinks armored truck robbery
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:09.760]  these men had families
[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:11.760]  and a future ahead of them
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:15.760]  but they were gunned down by radical leftists
[1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:18.760]  Tupac's stepdad he was the mastermind of the operation
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:20.760]  he was also one of the triggermen
[1:57:20.760 --> 1:57:24.760]  and Susan Rosenberg was one of the getaway drivers
[1:57:24.760 --> 1:57:27.760]  keep in mind that these bank and armored truck robberies
[1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:31.760]  were not about getting rich and running away
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:33.760]  to retire somewhere on the beach
[1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:36.760]  no in their minds this was total war
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:38.760]  this was war against America
[1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:41.760]  they termed these robberies expropriations
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:43.760]  almost acts of war
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:46.760]  and as one of their members eloquently
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:49.760]  well not so eloquently commented one time
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:52.760]  in war people get hurt
[1:57:52.760 --> 1:57:56.760]  so if you can understand that philosophy
[1:57:56.760 --> 1:57:59.760]  you can understand the mindset
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:02.760]  of the motivation behind the gang
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:06.760]  so whatever happened to Linda Evans and Susan Rosenberg
[1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:08.760]  where are they now
[1:58:08.760 --> 1:58:11.760]  well they were finally arrested in 1984
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:15.760]  Susan Rosenberg was planning to bomb the U.S. Naval Academy
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:20.760]  local police and the FBI found hundreds of pounds of explosives
[1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:22.760]  and a huge cache of weapons
[1:58:22.760 --> 1:58:25.760]  I mean they were prepared for an all out war
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:27.760]  thank God they got busted
[1:58:27.760 --> 1:58:29.760]  Linda Evans was fined
[1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:31.760]  the report's got about a minute left
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:34.760]  and then it gets into how they were pardoned later
[1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:37.760]  but that's real terrorists attacking the Capitol
[1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:39.760]  she'll read about it and see the video
[1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:41.760]  and ban the video
[1:58:41.760 --> 1:59:06.760]  that martin people that bomb the Capitol
[1:59:12.760 --> 1:59:16.760]  I always questioned if vitamin supplements ever actually did anything
[1:59:16.760 --> 1:59:19.760]  I never felt much of an effect from other products
[1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:23.760]  but I felt vitamin mineral fusion the first time I took it
[1:59:23.760 --> 1:59:25.760]  immediately
[1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:27.760]  I love how it dissolves in water
[1:59:27.760 --> 1:59:29.760]  I take it every day with my supper
[1:59:29.760 --> 1:59:31.760]  it tastes great, feels great
[1:59:31.760 --> 1:59:34.760]  and right now it's 50% off
[1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:36.760]  it sells out fast
[1:59:36.760 --> 1:59:38.760]  so stock up now at 50% off
[1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:41.760]  at infowarsstore.com
[1:59:41.760 --> 2:00:09.760]  vitamin mineral fusion at infowarsstore.com
[2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:14.760]  here we are
[2:00:17.760 --> 2:00:19.760]  we're only
[2:00:20.760 --> 2:00:22.760]  21 hours out
[2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:25.760]  22 hours out
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:29.760]  from the inauguration of Joe Biden for stealing the election
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:33.760]  and I'd say they got a tiger by the tail
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:35.760]  it's plain to see
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:39.760]  because
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:42.760]  this guy is a communist Chinese agent
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:46.760]  they blame Trump over and over and over and over and over again
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:47.760]  with no evidence
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:50.760]  there was a Russian spy they used that to spy on him illegally
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:52.760]  and they lied to Congress about it
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:55.760]  they said Trump's enemies were Russian agents
[2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:57.760]  or the globalist enemies
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:01.760]  were Russian agents so they could attack all of Trump's defenders
[2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:03.760]  just absolutely out of control
[2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:05.760]  and now
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:07.760]  Hillary Clinton has a podcast
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:09.760]  that's force fed to everyone
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:11.760]  over all these different platforms
[2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:15.760]  and she had Nancy Pelosi on
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:19.760]  and they talked about how they think Putin probably
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:21.760]  directed the capital attack
[2:01:21.760 --> 2:01:24.760]  well then you should send Putin a present
[2:01:24.760 --> 2:01:26.760]  Hillary and Pelosi
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:28.760]  because this really hurt Trump and hurt America
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:30.760]  how the left was able to break in there
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:32.760]  and blame the giant crowd of peaceful people
[2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:35.760]  the idea of the left is out there
[2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:37.760]  that Trump's happy about this or I'm happy about this
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:39.760]  it's ridiculous
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:41.760]  we're not like you
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:43.760]  that's why we had a blind spot
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:45.760]  that our demonstrations are peaceful
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:47.760]  the police had a blind spot as well
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:49.760]  because it was a minority that did it
[2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:52.760]  here is
[2:01:52.760 --> 2:01:54.760]  Pelosi all roads lead to Putin
[2:01:54.760 --> 2:01:56.760]  so talk about conspiracy theories
[2:01:56.760 --> 2:01:58.760]  you know they said they ban you off Twitter
[2:01:58.760 --> 2:01:59.760]  if it's a conspiracy theory
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:01.760]  oh okay but not this one
[2:02:01.760 --> 2:02:03.760]  with the whole Mueller investigation
[2:02:03.760 --> 2:02:05.760]  39 million dollars
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:07.760]  whatever spent not one centella
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:09.760]  of real Russian collusion
[2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:11.760]  but we got communist China
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:14.760]  we got communist China
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:18.760]  what's now come out
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:21.760]  communist China directly manipulated
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:23.760]  the election
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:25.760]  and communist China with executive orders
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:27.760]  is being designated
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:29.760]  for those crimes today and major announcements
[2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:31.760]  that are up on info wars dot com
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:33.760]  we'll tell you more about that in a moment
[2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:35.760]  but here's what Pelosi
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:37.760]  had to say with Hillary
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:41.760]  we learned a lot about
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:43.760]  our system of government
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:45.760]  over the last four years
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:47.760]  with a president who
[2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:49.760]  disdains democracy
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:51.760]  and as you have said numerous
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:53.760]  times has other agendas
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:55.760]  what they all are I don't think we yet know
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:57.760]  I hope historically
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:02:59.760]  we will find out who he's beholden
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:01.760]  to who pulls his strings
[2:03:01.760 --> 2:03:03.760]  I would love to see his phone records
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:05.760]  to see whether he was talking to Putin
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:07.760]  the day that the insurgents
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:09.760]  invaded our capital
[2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:11.760]  but we now know that
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:13.760]  not just him but his
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:15.760]  enablers his accomplices
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:17.760]  his cult members
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:19.760]  have the same disregard
[2:03:19.760 --> 2:03:21.760]  for democracy
[2:03:21.760 --> 2:03:23.760]  do you think we need a 9-11
[2:03:23.760 --> 2:03:25.760]  type commission to
[2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:27.760]  investigate and report
[2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:29.760]  everything that they can pull together
[2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:31.760]  and explain what happened
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:33.760]  let me again to your point
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:35.760]  of who is he beholden to
[2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:37.760]  as I've said over and over
[2:03:37.760 --> 2:03:39.760]  as I've said to him in that picture with my blue suit
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:41.760]  as I was leaving
[2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:43.760]  what I was saying to him as I was pointing
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:45.760]  rudely at him
[2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:47.760]  with you Mr. President all roads
[2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:49.760]  lead to Putin
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:51.760]  I don't know what Putin has on him
[2:03:51.760 --> 2:03:53.760]  politically financially or personally
[2:03:53.760 --> 2:03:55.760]  but what happened last week
[2:03:55.760 --> 2:03:57.760]  is a gift to Putin because
[2:03:57.760 --> 2:03:59.760]  Putin wants to undermine democracy
[2:03:59.760 --> 2:04:01.760]  in our country and throughout the world
[2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:03.760]  it's a gift to you to help declare martial law
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:05.760]  okay that's enough get her off
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:07.760]  so there you go
[2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:09.760]  you've got Joe Biden
[2:04:09.760 --> 2:04:11.760]  on the payroll of Putin
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:13.760]  on the payroll of Gigi being on record his son
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:15.760]  the Moscow mayor's why three and a half million
[2:04:15.760 --> 2:04:17.760]  I mean it's ridiculous absolutely insane
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:19.760]  shifting gears
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:21.760]  Nick Fuentes was there
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:23.760]  I was there two weeks ago
[2:04:23.760 --> 2:04:25.760]  it was incredible
[2:04:25.760 --> 2:04:27.760]  probably a million Trump supporters out there
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:29.760]  but it was a tiny little
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:31.760]  30-40 thousand person area
[2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:33.760]  where you had to go through metal detectors to hear Trump
[2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:35.760]  everybody else just sat there in the freezing cold for hours
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:37.760]  and so long before I marched to the Capitol
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:39.760]  they'd gotten there
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:41.760]  and there'd been some piston cuffs and
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:43.760]  maybe 150 people got into the building
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:45.760]  they're calling this the new Pearl Harbor
[2:04:45.760 --> 2:04:47.760]  they're calling it the great insurrection
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:49.760]  they're calling it into the world
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:51.760]  they're calling for Nick Fuentes to be arrested because he was seen outside
[2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:53.760]  for me to be arrested
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:55.760]  I think it was great to see people say
[2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:57.760]  we know this was a fraudulent election
[2:04:57.760 --> 2:04:59.760]  but I think it was terrible that some people
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:01.760]  gave the system what they wanted when they broke in
[2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:03.760]  so Nick Fuentes has been quoted in the media
[2:05:03.760 --> 2:05:05.760]  as liking what happened
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:07.760]  I imagine that's probably out of context
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:09.760]  we appreciate him coming on to tell us what he really thinks
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:11.760]  so the founder of the Gropers
[2:05:11.760 --> 2:05:13.760]  former Trump volunteer and popular talk show host
[2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:15.760]  Nick Fuentes, Nick, thanks for coming on
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:17.760]  Thanks for having me
[2:05:17.760 --> 2:05:19.760]  I appreciate it
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:21.760]  we haven't talked to you since then
[2:05:21.760 --> 2:05:23.760]  thanks for coming on
[2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:25.760]  where do you want to start, what you saw that day
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:27.760]  what you really think?
[2:05:27.760 --> 2:05:29.760]  Sure, yeah, well
[2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:31.760]  yeah, we haven't talked since I saw you
[2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:33.760]  at the Trump rally shortly before
[2:05:33.760 --> 2:05:35.760]  the demonstration outside the Capitol
[2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:37.760]  and yeah, my experience was
[2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:39.760]  probably similar to yours
[2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:41.760]  like you said, I was at the Ellipse rally
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:43.760]  where Trump spoke
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:45.760]  and there was actually I believe a Capitol demonstration happening
[2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:47.760]  during the Trump speech
[2:05:47.760 --> 2:05:49.760]  because it was during the Trump
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:51.760]  speech that President
[2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:53.760]  or rather Vice President Mike Pence came out
[2:05:53.760 --> 2:05:55.760]  with this statement and he said that he would not
[2:05:55.760 --> 2:05:57.760]  invoke the 12th Amendment
[2:05:57.760 --> 2:05:59.760]  and throw out the illegitimate
[2:05:59.760 --> 2:06:01.760]  electoral college votes unilaterally
[2:06:01.760 --> 2:06:03.760]  I think that happened about
[2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:05.760]  15 to 30 minutes before the President
[2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:07.760]  finished his speech and so I know that
[2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:09.760]  there was activity on the Capitol
[2:06:09.760 --> 2:06:11.760]  while that was happening
[2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:13.760]  so I saw the Trump speech
[2:06:13.760 --> 2:06:15.760]  and then when that was over there was sort of this
[2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:17.760]  big bum rush towards the exit
[2:06:17.760 --> 2:06:19.760]  outside of the rally
[2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:21.760]  and we tried to get out of there as fast as we could
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:23.760]  we made it over to the Capitol
[2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:25.760]  and when we got there
[2:06:25.760 --> 2:06:27.760]  the entire Capitol building was surrounded
[2:06:27.760 --> 2:06:29.760]  and I have to say
[2:06:29.760 --> 2:06:31.760]  it was a pretty awesome site
[2:06:31.760 --> 2:06:33.760]  because I had been
[2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:35.760]  and I know that you were there as well
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:37.760]  we were traveling the country in Phoenix
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:39.760]  Atlanta all over the place
[2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:41.760]  doing stop to steal protests, raising awareness
[2:06:41.760 --> 2:06:43.760]  about the voter fraud and everything
[2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:45.760]  and so to finally see hundreds
[2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:47.760]  of thousands of Trump supporters
[2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:49.760]  surrounding the U.S. Capitol building
[2:06:49.760 --> 2:06:51.760]  demanding that Mike Pence
[2:06:51.760 --> 2:06:53.760]  or the Republican senators take action
[2:06:53.760 --> 2:06:55.760]  on voter fraud, to me that was kind of
[2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:57.760]  like the fulfillment of the past two
[2:06:57.760 --> 2:06:59.760]  or three months of stop to steal protests
[2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:01.760]  and to me it looked like the American
[2:07:01.760 --> 2:07:03.760]  people were waking up, rising up
[2:07:03.760 --> 2:07:05.760]  and all of that
[2:07:05.760 --> 2:07:07.760]  later people falsely claim that I
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:09.760]  breached the Capitol which wasn't true
[2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:11.760]  but I stood outside the Capitol
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:13.760]  I watched, I gave a little speech
[2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:15.760]  and then we packed up and left
[2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:17.760]  and by the time we left there were rumors
[2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:19.760]  that National Guard was coming
[2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:21.760]  into break up the protests
[2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:23.760]  they sent in riot police and tear gas
[2:07:23.760 --> 2:07:25.760]  and flashbangs and all of that
[2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:27.760]  we had heard a rumor that somebody was shot inside
[2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:29.760]  that there was an active shooter
[2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:31.760]  and that turned out to be Ashley Babbitt unfortunately
[2:07:31.760 --> 2:07:33.760]  and so we got out of there
[2:07:33.760 --> 2:07:35.760]  I think at around four o'clock local time
[2:07:35.760 --> 2:07:37.760]  back to our hotel and then that was it
[2:07:37.760 --> 2:07:39.760]  but it was a
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:41.760]  easy day and who would have thought that it
[2:07:41.760 --> 2:07:43.760]  returned into something like that you know I talked to
[2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:45.760]  sure so when I see the mainstream media quotes
[2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:47.760]  it's not a context they say that I loved it
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:49.760]  no I said seeing a million people come out
[2:07:49.760 --> 2:07:51.760]  was great and then it was terrible that a few people
[2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:53.760]  let the media
[2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:55.760]  engage in deception and also
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:07:57.760]  thousands of retweets, thousands of tweets
[2:07:57.760 --> 2:07:59.760]  calling for your arrest, my arrest because
[2:07:59.760 --> 2:08:01.760]  it showed us in the Capitol directing people
[2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:03.760]  that was the Georgia Capitol
[2:08:03.760 --> 2:08:05.760]  months before us peacefully there
[2:08:05.760 --> 2:08:07.760]  not the DC Capitol
[2:08:07.760 --> 2:08:09.760]  left knows that but they still engage in deceptions
[2:08:09.760 --> 2:08:11.760]  well yeah exactly
[2:08:11.760 --> 2:08:13.760]  it's lies somebody
[2:08:13.760 --> 2:08:15.760]  posted a screenshot from
[2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:17.760]  the Baked Alaska live stream
[2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:19.760]  claiming that I was in the live stream
[2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:21.760]  and you know it's funny because I went back
[2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:23.760]  and I watched the actual clip from the live stream
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:25.760]  that people were claiming showed me inside the Capitol
[2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:27.760]  and the
[2:08:27.760 --> 2:08:29.760]  journalists who posted it probably selected
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:31.760]  the frame in the video
[2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:33.760]  which obscured the face
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:35.760]  of the person that they were claiming was me the most
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:37.760]  when you click play and resume the video
[2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:39.760]  the person looks nothing like me
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:41.760]  and that was one instance of it
[2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:43.760]  the other instance like you said is
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:45.760]  we were in the Atlanta Capitol and you and I were there
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:47.760]  we went through a metal detector
[2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:49.760]  security let us in
[2:08:49.760 --> 2:08:51.760]  totally legal, totally lawful
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:53.760]  and that was months ago and they were claiming
[2:08:53.760 --> 2:08:55.760]  that that was a siege on the US Capitol
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:08:57.760]  so at this point what's
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:08:59.760]  kind of scary is that journalists
[2:08:59.760 --> 2:09:01.760]  and the sort of
[2:09:01.760 --> 2:09:03.760]  anti-fascist
[2:09:03.760 --> 2:09:05.760]  specifically type journalists on Twitter
[2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:07.760]  are now utilizing this
[2:09:07.760 --> 2:09:09.760]  basically to just
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:11.760]  go after their political enemies and use the FBI
[2:09:11.760 --> 2:09:13.760]  and wield the intelligence community
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:15.760]  wield federal law enforcement
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:17.760]  against their enemies
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:19.760]  it's this unprecedented opportunity where if they could say
[2:09:19.760 --> 2:09:21.760]  oh Alex Jones and Nick Francis were at this thing
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:23.760]  tagged the FBI on Twitter
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:25.760]  and then
[2:09:25.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  maybe now we're embroiled in an investigation
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:29.760]  so it's got a scary time
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:31.760]  exactly authoritarians they are
[2:09:31.760 --> 2:09:33.760]  let's talk about the martial law in DC
[2:09:33.760 --> 2:09:35.760]  what Biden's going to do
[2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:37.760]  what do the Q people do when Trump leaves tomorrow morning
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:39.760]  so much to talk about with Nick Fuentes
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:10:03.760]  I'm Alex Jones this is the Info War
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:11.760]  it is the destruction
[2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:13.760]  of society as we know it
[2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:15.760]  it is making the population poor
[2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:17.760]  by designs we can be controlled
[2:10:17.760 --> 2:10:19.760]  with a medical
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:21.760]  technocracy over you and your family
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:23.760]  they're destroying
[2:10:23.760 --> 2:10:25.760]  civilization we build it in their dystopic
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:27.760]  image

[2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:33.760]  we are fighting for a pro-human future

[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:37.760]  to research and share with others
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:39.760]  and join the fight

[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:19.760]  but believe me I have really wanted it back in
[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:21.760]  because it works naturally
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:23.760]  unlike some of the stuff that's over the counter
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:25.760]  that makes you all be speedy and irritable
[2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:27.760]  and gives you a headache
[2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:29.760]  this is naturally occurring
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:31.760]  it's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:33.760]  and it's passed on somehow
[2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.760]  through their eggs to us
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:37.760]  you chew up the pills they taste great

[2:11:45.760 --> 2:12:07.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:17.760]  music plays
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:19.760]  little Joe Biden
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:21.760]  is going to have an inauguration with nobody there
[2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:23.760]  got a big steel barrier up there
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:25.760]  30,000 troops
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:27.760]  40,000 police
[2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:29.760]  more than have ever been in any US city ever
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:31.760]  not even where in major wars
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:33.760]  and the CFR says
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:35.760]  American democracy may be doomed by populism
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:37.760]  so
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:39.760]  what they're saying is
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:41.760]  democracy might doom
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:43.760]  democracy
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:45.760]  because populism is what you think is democracy
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:47.760]  where a republic has been to contain tyrants
[2:12:47.760 --> 2:12:49.760]  and the mad mob
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:51.760]  but they're scared
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:53.760]  all over the world people are upset
[2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:55.760]  with the new world order
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:57.760]  and so there's an attack on the nation state
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:12:59.760]  Nick Feuentes
[2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:01.760]  I don't want to write us into the story
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:03.760]  it's the opposite we're not Hunter S. Thompson that did that
[2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:05.760]  I don't even try to track my name
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:07.760]  and I had friends family calling
[2:13:07.760 --> 2:13:09.760]  saying are they going to arrest you
[2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:11.760]  New York Times, Washington Post
[2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:13.760]  hundreds of publications
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:15.760]  Wall Street Journal, arrest Jones, arrest Feuentes
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:17.760]  their own reporters saying here's shots of them here
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:19.760]  here's shots of them there and it was us in the Georgia Capitol
[2:13:19.760 --> 2:13:21.760]  different clothing, different day
[2:13:21.760 --> 2:13:23.760]  all peaceful everyone lined up nice for a group photo
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:25.760]  with state rep Vernon Jones
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:27.760]  and then they just turned that into
[2:13:27.760 --> 2:13:29.760]  the greatest commando raid in history
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:31.760]  the most
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:33.760]  Chuck Schumer called it the new Pearl Harbor
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:35.760]  Jones secretly caught
[2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:37.760]  confessing to organizing the rally
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:39.760]  on my TV show talking about it
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:41.760]  I mean it's just the level of
[2:13:41.760 --> 2:13:43.760]  deception they engage in is cartoonish
[2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:45.760]  what do you think all this is going
[2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:47.760]  well you know like
[2:13:47.760 --> 2:13:49.760]  we said before the break I think that
[2:13:49.760 --> 2:13:51.760]  ultimately this is a precursor
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:53.760]  to what you're going to see under the Biden administration
[2:13:53.760 --> 2:13:55.760]  and that is the weaponization
[2:13:55.760 --> 2:13:57.760]  of the security state
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:13:59.760]  and the intelligence apparatus against
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:01.760]  like us and it's unfortunate
[2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:03.760]  we've been living in a country where the left
[2:14:03.760 --> 2:14:05.760]  controls most of the power structures
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:07.760]  if not all of them but for the past
[2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:09.760]  four years we at least had Trump
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:11.760]  in the White House we have Republicans with
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:13.760]  some power in Congress and
[2:14:13.760 --> 2:14:15.760]  now after this capital siege
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:17.760]  Trump has been totally disempowered
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:19.760]  he's been de-platformed kicked off
[2:14:19.760 --> 2:14:21.760]  of social media there's this resistance
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:23.760]  and sort of uprising even within
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:25.760]  his own cabinet all these resignations
[2:14:25.760 --> 2:14:27.760]  and everything and now as we enter the
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:29.760]  Biden administration we're going to see
[2:14:29.760 --> 2:14:31.760]  what the full power of the left looks like
[2:14:31.760 --> 2:14:33.760]  when they control not only all
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:35.760]  of the conventional power structures
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:37.760]  that we know journalism the media
[2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:39.760]  Hollywood academia
[2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:41.760]  and so on social media but now
[2:14:41.760 --> 2:14:43.760]  they'll also be wielding the Justice
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.760]  Department the FBI and so on
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:47.760]  and the kinds of lies that you're seeing
[2:14:47.760 --> 2:14:49.760]  it's very deliberate it's very targeted
[2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:51.760]  they know that this is a very critical
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:53.760]  time where all they have to do is
[2:14:53.760 --> 2:14:55.760]  allege that we were near the capital
[2:14:55.760 --> 2:14:57.760]  inside the capital or something like that
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:14:59.760]  and they're going to bring down
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:01.760]  bearing down on our doors the full
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:03.760]  power of FBI DOJ and so on
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:05.760]  so it's very deliberate what
[2:15:05.760 --> 2:15:07.760]  they're doing they and it's unfortunate
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:09.760]  that the right doesn't seem to understand
[2:15:09.760 --> 2:15:11.760]  this the left was given
[2:15:11.760 --> 2:15:13.760]  a great crisis on January 6
[2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:15.760]  a challenge to the legitimacy
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  kind of of the federal
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:19.760]  government I mean that's in some ways
[2:15:19.760 --> 2:15:21.760]  what the capital siege represented and
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:23.760]  they're not using that as the pretext for
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:25.760]  total de-platforming unprecedented
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:27.760]  historic de-platforming and
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:29.760]  then the weaponization of the FBI
[2:15:29.760 --> 2:15:31.760]  so it's a tough time you know fortunately
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:33.760]  we're both innocent we're okay and it
[2:15:33.760 --> 2:15:35.760]  seems like we've been able
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:37.760]  to stay out of trouble but it shows
[2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:39.760]  what these people are capable of and what they'll
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:41.760]  be capable of once Biden is
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:43.760]  fully empowered after tomorrow
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:45.760]  I totally agree you know
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:47.760]  they're calling it the hunger games
[2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:49.760]  scenario but an empty
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:51.760]  inauguration except for tens of thousands
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:53.760]  of troops it looks like
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:55.760]  a celebration of
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:15:57.760]  Xi Jinping's birthday or something
[2:15:57.760 --> 2:15:59.760]  yeah it's like North Korea
[2:15:59.760 --> 2:16:01.760]  well it isn't that funny I think it was
[2:16:01.760 --> 2:16:03.760]  during one of Trump's
[2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:05.760]  maybe it was Trump's inauguration or maybe one of
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:07.760]  his other speeches
[2:16:07.760 --> 2:16:09.760]  I know that he wanted to have a parade
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:11.760]  with missiles and tanks and things
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:13.760]  like that and I remember that the media said
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:15.760]  that just goes to show that Trump
[2:16:15.760 --> 2:16:17.760]  is a wannabe dictator
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:19.760]  and he admires people like Kim Jong
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:21.760]  on and so on and then
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:23.760]  it's going to be the Biden inauguration
[2:16:23.760 --> 2:16:25.760]  that you have like you said 30,000
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:27.760]  National Guard
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:29.760]  40,000 police, walls, military
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:31.760]  checkpoints all the bridges into the city
[2:16:31.760 --> 2:16:33.760]  closed it's kind of amazing
[2:16:33.760 --> 2:16:35.760]  how quickly we got to this point but
[2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:37.760]  you know I said on my show last night it's actually
[2:16:37.760 --> 2:16:39.760]  a very apropos and fitting inauguration
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:41.760]  because at least
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:43.760]  now we've sort of done away with
[2:16:43.760 --> 2:16:45.760]  this facade that Biden has
[2:16:45.760 --> 2:16:47.760]  a popular mandate because the rhetoric
[2:16:47.760 --> 2:16:49.760]  just a few weeks ago was
[2:16:49.760 --> 2:16:51.760]  this is the most popular president ever
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:53.760]  right 80 million votes
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:55.760]  and he's the largest vote getter
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:16:57.760]  in history there was no fraud and so on
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:16:59.760]  and now we're going to have this
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:01.760]  inauguration with no citizens
[2:17:01.760 --> 2:17:03.760]  enforced by the military they have to build
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:05.760]  up walls literally to keep the American
[2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:07.760]  people from coming in
[2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:09.760]  and toppling the whole system
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:11.760]  so it's actually apropos and I think it's
[2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:13.760]  good because I think this is going
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:15.760]  to set the tone for the next four years
[2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:17.760]  but this is an illegitimate White House
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:19.760]  it's an illegitimate occupant in the White House
[2:17:19.760 --> 2:17:21.760]  and it shows that's
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:23.760]  why they have to build a giant fence
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:25.760]  totally overkill it's totally excessive
[2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:27.760]  but they need it to deter
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:29.760]  patriots Trump supporters
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:31.760]  any anything like that
[2:17:31.760 --> 2:17:33.760]  to do massive demonstrations or
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:35.760]  you know who knows what else during their
[2:17:35.760 --> 2:17:37.760]  inauguration so I actually
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:39.760]  look at this very visible
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:41.760]  severe crackdown this big display
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:43.760]  maybe people look at this and finally
[2:17:43.760 --> 2:17:45.760]  wake up we're not in control the system
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:47.760]  anymore this is not
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:49.760]  the sacred democracy that we hear about all
[2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:51.760]  the time it's actually totalitarianism
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:53.760]  that's right Nick I want to go back
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:55.760]  to something you said at the start of this segment
[2:17:55.760 --> 2:17:57.760]  you had them hyperventilating
[2:17:57.760 --> 2:17:59.760]  saying Trump shouldn't put National Guard in
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:01.760]  Kenosha or all these other places that were
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:03.760]  burning the ground hundreds of businesses
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:05.760]  per town being destroyed people being shot in
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:07.760]  the head antifa BLM checkpoints
[2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:09.760]  total bad lump
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:11.760]  billions of dollars of damage
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:13.760]  and then meanwhile
[2:18:13.760 --> 2:18:15.760]  they burned down the church next to the White House
[2:18:15.760 --> 2:18:17.760]  Trump does
[2:18:17.760 --> 2:18:19.760]  a photo op and has General Milley
[2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:21.760]  along with the rest of the cabinet with him
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:23.760]  and they call it total fascism that
[2:18:23.760 --> 2:18:25.760]  he's seen with the military
[2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:27.760]  and then he's a dictator and then Milley
[2:18:27.760 --> 2:18:29.760]  apologizes but now
[2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:31.760]  now that it's the Democrats and the Ch icon
[2:18:31.760 --> 2:18:33.760]  agent well you know here is
[2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:35.760]  the 30,000
[2:18:35.760 --> 2:18:37.760]  and 40,000 wine my goodness folks that's a lot
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:41.760]  of paramilitary this is crazy
[2:18:41.760 --> 2:18:43.760]  well yeah I remember that too
[2:18:43.760 --> 2:18:45.760]  that was after the riots in DC
[2:18:45.760 --> 2:18:47.760]  and I remember he had the
[2:18:47.760 --> 2:18:49.760]  Secret Service and the police
[2:18:49.760 --> 2:18:51.760]  sort of occupy the foreground
[2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:53.760]  in front of the White House
[2:18:53.760 --> 2:18:55.760]  and they said this is what a coward looks like
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:18:57.760]  this is a man who's afraid of the people
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:18:59.760]  like like you said and he came out and held up
[2:18:59.760 --> 2:19:01.760]  the Bible and that was fascism that was
[2:19:01.760 --> 2:19:03.760]  you know this is very
[2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:05.760]  symbolic display of how it's
[2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:07.760]  the people with Black Lives Matter
[2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:09.760]  against the oppressing police
[2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:11.760]  and it's obviously nothing
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:13.760]  in comparison to what Biden
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:15.760]  requires just to get inaugurated
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:17.760]  and the comparison
[2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:19.760]  is even broader than that it's the
[2:19:19.760 --> 2:19:21.760]  entire Black Lives Matter situation
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:23.760]  and anti-fuss situation that's been going on
[2:19:23.760 --> 2:19:25.760]  for the past six months
[2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:27.760]  and frankly you know to me the lesson
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:29.760]  is not so much about the double standard
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:31.760]  because we know this we expect
[2:19:31.760 --> 2:19:33.760]  this it's been like this for a long time but
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:35.760]  you know when there's this capital
[2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:37.760]  siege and they're so
[2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:39.760]  exaggerating what happened at the capital
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:41.760]  I mean really what you had is
[2:19:41.760 --> 2:19:43.760]  some gullible boomers and some QAnon
[2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:45.760]  people were wandering around
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:47.760]  the capital looking like tourists I mean this was
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:49.760]  not an insurrection this was
[2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:51.760]  routiness this was civil
[2:19:51.760 --> 2:19:53.760]  disobedience but the left
[2:19:53.760 --> 2:19:55.760]  has taken this opportunity and they've got
[2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:57.760]  now the DOJ
[2:19:57.760 --> 2:19:59.760]  and the FBI working around the clock
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:01.760]  24-7 to use
[2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:03.760]  tracking, surveillance, facial recognition
[2:20:03.760 --> 2:20:05.760]  to track down and charge
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:07.760]  everybody even peripherally associated
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:09.760]  and like the stars that you go on Twitter
[2:20:09.760 --> 2:20:11.760]  it's just millions of people
[2:20:11.760 --> 2:20:13.760]  all compiling here's
[2:20:13.760 --> 2:20:15.760]  Jones and Fuentes the night before inciting
[2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:17.760]  arrest them oh
[2:20:17.760 --> 2:20:19.760]  here's Trump giving a speech arrest him
[2:20:19.760 --> 2:20:21.760]  and then they're all breathlessly oh these are insurrectionists
[2:20:21.760 --> 2:20:23.760]  I'm so frightened
[2:20:23.760 --> 2:20:25.760]  I want them arrested now meanwhile almost everybody
[2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:27.760]  that got the capital was
[2:20:27.760 --> 2:20:29.760]  in between the velvet ropes this is insane
[2:20:29.760 --> 2:20:31.760]  I'm going to ask Nick Fuentes how we

[2:23:39.760 --> 2:23:41.760]  the resistance.video
[2:23:43.760 --> 2:23:45.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones

[2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:31.760]  music
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:36.160]  two National Guardsmen were removed from their duties today
[2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:38.640]  for being on a heightened watch list.
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:43.640]  An ATF tactical fast team has just set up
[2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:45.880]  on top of X building.
[2:24:45.880 --> 2:24:49.760]  So that's the type of stuff that's going on.
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:51.720]  We've got a reporters on the ground there
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:56.480]  with a live feed of the Capitol at infowars.com
[2:24:56.480 --> 2:24:58.120]  and newswars.com.
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:01.440]  Nick Jay Fuentes of nickjayfuentes.com is here.
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:03.560]  You can find his nightly TV program.
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:07.240]  It's very popular as well by going to his website.
[2:25:07.240 --> 2:25:08.800]  Nick, here's the deal.
[2:25:08.800 --> 2:25:12.320]  I try not to fight with the different active scripts.
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:14.280]  And I like overall what the groipers are doing.
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:16.360]  And I like your point about the Republican Party
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:17.560]  being one of our biggest enemies
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:19.400]  and trying to totally take that party over,
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:20.400]  not just partially.
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:21.880]  We'll speak to some solutions in a moment
[2:25:21.880 --> 2:25:24.160]  or a new national party you've talked about
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:26.720]  if one of these parties has to go.
[2:25:26.720 --> 2:25:31.240]  But the Boogaloo's, I mean, they say they work with BLM
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:32.400]  because they're for everybody's freedom.
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:36.040]  But they're actually connected to Soros, we know.
[2:25:36.040 --> 2:25:37.200]  They come out of nowhere.
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:38.800]  They bragged, they broke into the Capitol.
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:40.080]  They bragged, they let it.
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:42.680]  Zero Hedge is a 20 page article showing all their quotes
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:44.280]  from their top people.
[2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:46.000]  And then none of them get in trouble.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:49.320]  Now I've not called the FBI on them, okay?
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:51.160]  And I understand we have a tyrannical government
[2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:52.320]  and we're probably gonna come to the point
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:54.560]  sometime that things get worse and worse.
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:25:56.600]  It might be time to have to go offensive,
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:25:59.040]  but I wanna exhaust all the other remedies first.
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:01.520]  I'm certainly not gonna attack with a bunch of people
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:05.000]  at the Capitol, the guy dressed up in a shaman outfit.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:06.280]  I'm trying to attack their ideas
[2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:08.160]  and turn things around that way.
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:09.640]  But then the Boogaloo's are calling us up.
[2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:10.960]  Well, hey, why are you being mean to the Boogaloo's?
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:14.040]  Well, I mean, my God, you're saying you're part of all this.
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:16.120]  You've got Antifa dressed up like patriots.
[2:26:16.120 --> 2:26:18.520]  You guys broke in, you let a few people in with you.
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:20.960]  Now the country's under martial law basically.
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:22.640]  Can't you see who you serve?
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:24.720]  Most of the Boogaloo's aren't feds.
[2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:27.760]  But if you look at the FBI infiltrating the militias
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:29.000]  in the nineties and things,
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:31.360]  this has all the telltale signs of this.
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:32.560]  And the people involved in this,
[2:26:32.560 --> 2:26:35.160]  just like the Q followers, need to know what's happened to them.
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:37.080]  So speak to that, your view on that.
[2:26:37.080 --> 2:26:38.480]  And what's gonna happen tomorrow
[2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:40.200]  when Joe Biden gets sworn in
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:43.320]  and the Q people literally in the streets
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:45.120]  and on my website, I see them.
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:46.240]  They're mad at me going,
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:48.200]  Jones, you've joined the bad guys.
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:51.400]  Trump is gonna be the president.
[2:26:51.400 --> 2:26:52.440]  No, he's not.
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:56.440]  I've talked to two lawyers very close to the president
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:26:57.800]  in the last 48 hours.
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:26:58.840]  And I've talked to somebody else
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:26:59.720]  very close to the president.
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:00.640]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:02.040]  Trump's leaving.
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:03.000]  He's upset.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:04.760]  He's gonna fight back against the globalist.
[2:27:04.760 --> 2:27:05.600]  He's not gonna give up,
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:07.560]  but he's not gonna be president anymore, folks.
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:09.400]  Okay, we actually talked to the president,
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:11.080]  unlike the made up Q crap.
[2:27:11.080 --> 2:27:13.000]  And I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:14.400]  We've got yours against.
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:16.560]  Give me your take on all that.
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:19.360]  Well, you're totally right about the Q people.
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:21.760]  And I agree it is frustrating.
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:23.520]  It's just delusion at this point.
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:26.520]  It's January 19th, the inauguration is tomorrow.
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:29.000]  And we've seen that the stop to steal efforts
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.240]  as valiant and noble as they were,
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:32.600]  fell through and they fell through
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:35.720]  because the Republican party's totally corrupt.
[2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:37.200]  The Republican state legislators
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:41.160]  didn't wanna claw back their power to appoint electors.
[2:27:41.160 --> 2:27:42.800]  The Supreme Court didn't wanna intervene,
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:44.280]  not even three justices
[2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:47.240]  that the president appointed in the past four years.
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:49.080]  And ultimately vice president,
[2:27:49.080 --> 2:27:50.720]  Mike Pence and Republican senators
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:53.240]  didn't wanna object to fraudulent electors.
[2:27:53.240 --> 2:27:55.680]  We exhausted all of our constitutional options
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:56.520]  and that's it.
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:27:58.680]  And I've heard some of these crazy rumors
[2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:01.640]  and crazy ideas about what could possibly happen tomorrow.
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:03.000]  At a certain point,
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:06.440]  just have to accept the fact that the Trump administration,
[2:28:06.440 --> 2:28:09.160]  as much as I love Trump, as much as I love the man,
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:11.160]  and as much as I think that he's a great man
[2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:12.360]  and a true believer,
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:14.480]  the Trump administration for the past four years
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:17.160]  was full of people sabotaging him, subverting him.
[2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:19.880]  And a lot of people that were just grossly incompetent.
[2:28:19.880 --> 2:28:22.160]  Even you take a look at the stop to steal effort
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:24.520]  and not the Ali Alexander rallies,
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:27.080]  but the resistance against the voter fraud
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:30.040]  from the legal team who had Sidney Powell
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:31.680]  talking about release the Kraken
[2:28:31.680 --> 2:28:34.800]  and Linwood who just totally went unhinged
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:36.280]  in the past couple of weeks.
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:38.400]  This was at no point, in my opinion,
[2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:40.360]  a very serious or viable effort
[2:28:40.360 --> 2:28:42.000]  to overturn the results of the election.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.440]  And that's unfortunate and it hurts me to say that
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:46.160]  because I love President Trump
[2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:48.520]  and I wanted him to be in office for four more years.
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:50.360]  And I know that you and I did everything we could.
[2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:53.880]  We went to rallies and we went to state capitals and so on,
[2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:55.800]  but they're just living in this reality
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:58.480]  where Donald Trump is a messiah
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:01.280]  and there's all this JFK stuff and whatever,
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:02.440]  and it's just not gonna happen.
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:04.640]  And at the very least tomorrow,
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:06.520]  when Biden is inaugurated,
[2:29:06.520 --> 2:29:08.200]  hopefully that will be put to bed.
[2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:11.040]  I don't know what the mental gymnastics will be tomorrow,
[2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:13.640]  when that happens, what the next part of the plan is,
[2:29:13.640 --> 2:29:15.840]  what the new thing to watch out for
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:20.000]  will be the next crumbs dropped by Q on HN or whatever.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:22.040]  But hopefully that'll finally put that to bed.
[2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:23.280]  The good thing about QAnon,
[2:29:23.280 --> 2:29:27.160]  I always thought was that it got a lot of regular people
[2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:28.480]  to believe the right things,
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:30.960]  even if they were believing them for the wrong reasons.
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:33.480]  You know, it took a lot of maybe mainstream,
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:35.320]  conservative, Republican types
[2:29:35.320 --> 2:29:38.120]  who believe this usual stuff about small government
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:41.080]  and free trade and mass immigration and low taxes.
[2:29:41.080 --> 2:29:43.560]  And I think it woke them up about the power of the elites
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:46.000]  and the evil and the corruption of the elites
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.640]  and kind of this international thing that's going on
[2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:50.240]  with foreign governments.
[2:29:50.240 --> 2:29:51.480]  I did and countless others did
[2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:53.280]  and you've been around a while, did.
[2:29:53.280 --> 2:29:56.520]  And it became Q though, like, oh, Q knows about this.
[2:29:56.520 --> 2:29:57.920]  And then, but don't worry, everything's fine.
[2:29:57.920 --> 2:30:00.360]  But I mean, I agree, it was kind of a pop play
[2:30:00.360 --> 2:30:01.200]  for the general public.
[2:30:01.200 --> 2:30:03.240]  It was just now waking up to get into it.
[2:30:03.240 --> 2:30:05.320]  But because it was so simple
[2:30:05.320 --> 2:30:06.720]  and you're part of a secret club,
[2:30:06.720 --> 2:30:09.600]  it was very, very beguiling, very seductive.
[2:30:10.840 --> 2:30:13.280]  Right, well, yeah, that's a big component of it totally.
[2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:15.280]  And, you know, there was this aspect
[2:30:15.280 --> 2:30:17.880]  of people had to track it down and decode it
[2:30:17.880 --> 2:30:19.480]  and they formed these little communities.
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:20.840]  And it was interesting.
[2:30:20.840 --> 2:30:23.640]  It was also, I think, a wave, it was sort of an escape
[2:30:23.640 --> 2:30:27.240]  because Trump represented so much hope in 2016
[2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:31.080]  and very quickly after his inauguration in 2017,
[2:30:31.080 --> 2:30:33.400]  you could see that the establishment got their hooks
[2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:34.960]  in his administration.
[2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:36.280]  You could see that Ryan's pre-biz
[2:30:36.280 --> 2:30:38.680]  filled up the White House with all these terrible people.
[2:30:38.680 --> 2:30:41.600]  The policies that we elected Trump to accomplish
[2:30:41.600 --> 2:30:44.000]  or to pass were put on a back burner
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:45.960]  and instead they focused on Obamacare
[2:30:45.960 --> 2:30:47.880]  and corporate tax cut and so on.
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:48.720]  I totally agree.
[2:30:48.720 --> 2:30:50.280]  So let me ask you, let me ask you,
[2:30:50.280 --> 2:30:54.040]  what happens tomorrow when Biden gets sworn in
[2:30:54.040 --> 2:30:56.080]  and Trump flies off to Mar-a-Lago,
[2:30:56.080 --> 2:30:58.840]  what are the cute people gonna do then?
[2:30:58.840 --> 2:30:59.680]  I don't know.
[2:30:59.680 --> 2:31:02.840]  I guess they'll have to come up with some new fiction,
[2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:04.800]  maybe in 2024.
[2:31:04.800 --> 2:31:07.800]  That's when the American corporation will be dissolved
[2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:09.120]  and the Republic will come back.
[2:31:09.120 --> 2:31:09.960]  I don't know.
[2:31:09.960 --> 2:31:11.160]  I don't follow it very closely.
[2:31:11.160 --> 2:31:13.640]  Yeah, Biden had to be put into complete the fraud
[2:31:13.640 --> 2:31:16.080]  of the contract with the Mar-a-Vinjians.
[2:31:16.080 --> 2:31:17.480]  Yeah.
[2:31:17.480 --> 2:31:18.320]  That's right.
[2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:20.400]  It's all part of the five-dimensional chess
[2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:21.920]  and we're making fun of it,
[2:31:21.920 --> 2:31:26.920]  but unfortunately there are a lot of nice earnest people
[2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:29.880]  who fall into this stuff because they're naive,
[2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:32.200]  I think a little bit and maybe inexperienced
[2:31:32.200 --> 2:31:33.920]  and basically they're taken for a ride.
[2:31:33.920 --> 2:31:35.720]  I think they're basically taken advantage of
[2:31:35.720 --> 2:31:38.320]  by people who are knowingly deceiving them
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:40.080]  and they're getting caught up in this stuff.
[2:31:40.080 --> 2:31:42.480]  So tomorrow what I hope is that
[2:31:42.480 --> 2:31:45.160]  well-meaning Trump supporters, well-meaning nationalists,
[2:31:45.160 --> 2:31:47.840]  people that might have fallen into this stuff,
[2:31:47.840 --> 2:31:49.880]  I hope they take the good stuff out of it,
[2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:52.760]  which is that yes, the world is run by
[2:31:52.760 --> 2:31:55.480]  evil satanic elites, pedophiles.
[2:31:55.480 --> 2:31:58.520]  This international stuff is totally true, foreign collusion.
[2:31:58.520 --> 2:32:00.320]  Like that's all true and I hope that people
[2:32:00.320 --> 2:32:01.840]  will take that with them,
[2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:04.280]  but maybe they let this fantasy about
[2:32:04.280 --> 2:32:06.760]  a deep state operative working on our side
[2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:09.160]  and the government, like Robert Mueller's on our side.
[2:32:09.160 --> 2:32:11.240]  I hope they let that kind of stuff go
[2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:13.520]  because I think there is a lot of useful stuff
[2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:14.720]  in the Q and on narrative,
[2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:16.680]  which help people understand
[2:32:16.680 --> 2:32:18.000]  what's really going on in the world.
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.240]  So hopefully tomorrow a lot of these people
[2:32:20.240 --> 2:32:21.840]  who are, you know, they're good,
[2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:24.240]  they're patriots, well-meaning people and so on,
[2:32:24.240 --> 2:32:26.880]  I hope they'll wake up about the delusional aspect of it
[2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:28.720]  and then they'll be ready to join us in reality
[2:32:28.720 --> 2:32:31.160]  to continue the uphill, very difficult battle
[2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:33.160]  against a deep state that will take place
[2:32:33.160 --> 2:32:34.720]  under a Biden administration.
[2:32:34.720 --> 2:32:36.160]  And I don't like to admit that,
[2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:37.640]  but that's the way it's gonna be.
[2:32:37.640 --> 2:32:41.680]  So it'll be a big reality check.
[2:32:41.680 --> 2:32:42.520]  I agree with you, Nick.
[2:32:42.520 --> 2:32:44.280]  I just, I feel so sorry for these people.
[2:32:44.280 --> 2:32:45.120]  Does that care about them?
[2:32:45.120 --> 2:32:46.600]  I helped wake them up.
[2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:47.920]  And so much of what Q covered
[2:32:47.920 --> 2:32:49.360]  was already well-known real stuff.
[2:32:49.360 --> 2:32:50.720]  Just Q would attach to it.
[2:32:50.720 --> 2:32:52.000]  I was never in competition with Q.
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:53.600]  I'm not in competition with you or anybody.
[2:32:53.600 --> 2:32:55.440]  I've learned that as more people wake up, more people,
[2:32:55.440 --> 2:32:56.560]  we just make up more people and we,
[2:32:56.560 --> 2:32:57.560]  I'm gonna beat the globalists.
[2:32:57.560 --> 2:32:58.840]  That's my goal.
[2:32:58.840 --> 2:33:00.280]  And so I love the epic times.
[2:33:00.280 --> 2:33:01.920]  I love the work Mike Adams does.
[2:33:01.920 --> 2:33:04.120]  I love the work Tucker Carlson does.
[2:33:04.120 --> 2:33:05.920]  I feel good knowing there are all these good people
[2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:07.000]  out there with different perspectives,
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:08.800]  with that love, liberty, that I respect.
[2:33:08.800 --> 2:33:09.640]  But some people go,
[2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:11.680]  Jones, you're just jealous that, you know,
[2:33:11.680 --> 2:33:14.240]  Q hat can talk to Trump if you can't.
[2:33:14.240 --> 2:33:16.680]  I've got Trump's phone number for God's sakes.
[2:33:16.680 --> 2:33:19.040]  Trump's totally surrounded and going down.
[2:33:19.040 --> 2:33:19.880]  And these people are like,
[2:33:19.880 --> 2:33:23.680]  I talked to Q and Q level now and it's so sad.
[2:33:23.680 --> 2:33:24.720]  I wanna talk a little bit more with you
[2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:27.600]  in a final segment about solutions and other big issues
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:29.400]  that are front and center for Nick Fuentes.
[2:33:29.400 --> 2:33:31.520]  Nick Fuentes, of course, has a nightly show
[2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:34.160]  you can find at nickjfuentes.com.
[2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:36.080]  And of course, we'll tell you the actual URL.
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:37.640]  We'll come back, stay with us.
[2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:42.680]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[2:33:42.680 --> 2:33:45.520]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[2:33:45.520 --> 2:33:46.360]  Yes, sir.
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:47.200]  Yes, sir.
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:49.680]  I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday
[2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:51.680]  when I heard you got that first shipment
[2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:54.240]  of Living Defense in from Utah.
[2:33:54.240 --> 2:33:56.320]  I said, man, I gotta get on that show
[2:33:56.320 --> 2:33:57.880]  and give him an update.
[2:33:57.880 --> 2:34:01.440]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones show,
[2:34:01.440 --> 2:34:04.440]  I'm gonna tell the world about Living Defense
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:06.160]  and what it did for me personally.
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:09.720]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old, going on 20,
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:12.360]  thanks to this info for store products.
[2:34:12.360 --> 2:34:15.440]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[2:34:15.440 --> 2:34:17.840]  So I'm doing what I can, brother.
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:19.800]  So what my contention is,
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:22.600]  why don't we start this new year off right
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:25.600]  with everybody getting a couple bottles of Living Defense?
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:28.760]  Now, you gotta follow that up with the Microsoft Act.
[2:34:28.760 --> 2:34:29.840]  I learned that.
[2:34:29.840 --> 2:34:32.400]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:34.240]  We didn't know, we didn't screen your call.
[2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:35.360]  We had no idea.
[2:34:35.360 --> 2:34:37.320]  And I go to you a year later
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:38.760]  and you're here telling people about Living Defense,
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:40.280]  Living Defense, Living Defense.
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:43.120]  Anybody listening to my voice
[2:34:43.120 --> 2:34:45.120]  can simply search into the term
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:49.000]  Davos Group, Technocracy or Technocrats.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:52.400]  You will get Klaus Schwab and Sean Codd,
[2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:55.920]  Yunker and all the new world order globalists
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:34:58.840]  like Gigi Pink saying that they no longer want
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:01.240]  elected leaders over governments,
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:03.960]  that they want businessmen, technocrats over it.
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:05.400]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:06.480]  You might want to look into the guy
[2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:09.360]  that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:10.560]  to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:14.040]  You might want to find out who this super villain is.
[2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:17.200]  But you see, he believes because he's hidden playing you
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:18.560]  and you're not speaking out against it,
[2:35:18.560 --> 2:35:20.120]  that he has the right to do it to you.
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:21.680]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:23.760]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:25.440]  He developed since the 80s
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:27.600]  the plan for global sustainability.
[2:35:27.600 --> 2:35:31.120]  That means worldwide Neo feudalism in his own works.
[2:35:31.120 --> 2:35:33.000]  So you might want to find out
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:35.320]  how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:36.560]  before you take those shots.
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:38.840]  You might just want to find out who this villain is.
[2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:39.680]  All right.
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:48.640]  Q is a Bolshevik operation.
[2:35:48.640 --> 2:35:51.760]  Q is a relaunch of operation trust
[2:35:51.760 --> 2:35:54.120]  that the Soviets use in the 1920s
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:56.080]  to identify who their opposition was.
[2:35:56.080 --> 2:35:58.600]  That's when George Arwell wrote 1984
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:00.640]  that was about a futuristic Stalinistic
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:02.000]  world government system.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.480]  He talked about a manual Goldstein
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:06.840]  who was the supposed leader of the resistance
[2:36:06.840 --> 2:36:09.440]  but really worked for the controllers
[2:36:09.440 --> 2:36:11.920]  to be able to identify anyone that was a dissident.
[2:36:11.920 --> 2:36:12.880]  That's what's happening.
[2:36:12.880 --> 2:36:14.960]  So the storm of Q is real.
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:18.480]  It's a globalist martial law takeover of America.
[2:36:18.480 --> 2:36:21.760]  I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but you have been had.
[2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:23.880]  I was suspicious of it, knew what it was early on
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:26.520]  but did not realize it was the main thrust.
[2:36:26.520 --> 2:36:28.160]  The main thrust, the globalist takeover
[2:36:28.160 --> 2:36:30.520]  is operation trust 2.0.
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:32.600]  We're covering it all live on the air
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:34.720]  at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:36.320]  We'll have reporters on the ground
[2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:38.720]  covering the inauguration of the Communist Chinese spy
[2:36:38.720 --> 2:36:39.400]  Biden.
[2:36:39.400 --> 2:36:41.080]  The globalist are planning false flags.
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:42.400]  We pray we can stop them.
[2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:47.000]  Introducing Info Wars Life Pure Tumeric Extract.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:49.520]  This is taken under the tongue.
[2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:51.680]  It is pure turmeric.
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:54.880]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate
[2:36:54.880 --> 2:36:58.120]  turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:00.880]  and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:04.000]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.800]  and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:09.400]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:12.640]  The two formulas are different but both are concentrates
[2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:14.480]  and our first product got rave reviews.
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:16.560]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:18.680]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:20.120]  Some like bodies better.
[2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:23.000]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.440]  action and so much more and they fund the Info War.
[2:37:25.440 --> 2:37:28.880]  So get our new Liquid Tumeric Extract exclusively

[2:37:31.640 --> 2:37:34.560]  This is a 360 win.
[2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:37.800]  Tumeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies,
[2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:39.640]  for inflammation and so much more.
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:42.000]  Get yours today at infowarslife.com.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:53.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:37:53.720 --> 2:38:19.360]  All right, Nick Coyntez is almost as bad as Info Wars is.
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:22.000]  I was about to plug his big popular show
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.120]  about and I was told he was kicked off.
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:25.280]  That I guess he might be back.
[2:38:25.280 --> 2:38:26.560]  We'll ask him about that.
[2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:28.680]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:30.760]  But now we see the president censored.
[2:38:30.760 --> 2:38:33.120]  We see other presidents being censored.
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:36.520]  We see American ideas around the world
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:38.840]  being censored by big megacorporations.
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:40.640]  Where can people find you, Nick?
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:43.920]  And where do you think this deep state purge,
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:46.560]  this open authoritarianism where we're going from zero
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:49.160]  to 100 seconds, how far is it going to go?
[2:38:49.160 --> 2:38:50.880]  And where does that resistance amount?
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:55.040]  I think it should be through Congress and Cruz and Holly,
[2:38:55.040 --> 2:38:56.920]  who they're targeting and trying to expel.
[2:38:56.920 --> 2:38:58.080]  I think it should be through governors.
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:38:59.800]  But I think folks have to realize
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:02.240]  we're under the great reset and we're under attack
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:04.000]  and really get mobilized for that.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:08.360]  Or we're going to get really, really, really taken down deep.
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:10.440]  Well, I agree with you about mobilization
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:13.040]  because, and this is one of the things I'm most concerned
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:15.120]  about in the coming years is the vaccine.
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:16.760]  I think the next big push that we're
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:18.680]  going to see from the Biden administration
[2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:21.280]  will be the mass vaccination and it'll
[2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:24.560]  be mandatory vaccination with the vaccine passports.
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:27.080]  And that, to me, is the most imminent threat, which
[2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:30.080]  we need to begin mobilizing for and resisting that.
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:32.960]  You could find my show, by the way, on AmericaFirst.Live
[2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:36.320]  after I got censored from everything.
[2:39:36.320 --> 2:39:38.800]  As you asked for that, it's like you said,
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:41.360]  I'm about as banned now as you, which is unfortunate.
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:44.440]  It's not a great position to be in because of the monopoly
[2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:47.520]  or oligopoly that a lot of these major services wheel.
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:49.480]  But you're right, the time for the resistance is now.
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:52.000]  I think the big trick in the coming months
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:54.360]  and in this year in particular is
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:57.240]  going to be to build the alternative to Big Tech.
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:00.100]  This is, in my opinion, the greatest existential threat
[2:40:00.100 --> 2:40:02.400]  to the American right, to the resistance
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:03.720]  to the Biden administration.
[2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:07.480]  And the left is we have to retain a presence on the internet.
[2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:09.480]  Now, that doesn't necessarily mean a presence
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:12.560]  on the Big Tech platforms like Twitter and Facebook
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:14.320]  and YouTube and things like that.
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:16.760]  But it means a presence on the internet like you have.
[2:40:16.760 --> 2:40:18.760]  I mean, you're on band.video.
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:21.560]  And there are other people that have been able to survive
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:24.320]  off the platforms using their own websites,
[2:40:24.320 --> 2:40:26.760]  using their own services, and whatever.
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:28.160]  And that's going to be the big trick,
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:30.240]  is now that Donald Trump is off of Twitter,
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:32.400]  now that he has been de-platformed
[2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:35.720]  and he's joined us on the blacklist and everything,
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:38.280]  hopefully there will be a massive exodus
[2:40:38.280 --> 2:40:40.360]  of Trump supporters, conservatives,
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:42.720]  patriots off of the big platforms.
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:44.560]  Hopefully they'll be looking for alternatives,
[2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:46.600]  joining them, supporting them.
[2:40:46.600 --> 2:40:48.960]  Hopefully people with resources and with skills
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:51.440]  will be volunteering their resources and expertise
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:52.520]  to build these things.
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:56.920]  And we need to get the American right back online in 2021.
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:40:59.560]  And we need to build something sustainable and long term
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:00.640]  so we can stay online.
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:03.620]  Because ultimately, you can't compete in elections.
[2:41:03.620 --> 2:41:04.880]  You can't spread your message
[2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:08.000]  if you don't have access to the distribution of information.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.320]  You know, it's interesting,
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:12.240]  your show and your brand is called Infowars.
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:13.920]  I mean, you've been doing that for so long,
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:14.840]  but it's so prescient.
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:16.080]  It's an information war.
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:19.560]  And it's a war over the distribution of information.
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:22.120]  If the mainstream media and social media
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:24.800]  controls the distribution of information totally,
[2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:28.000]  well, good luck electing a candidate that's a Republican
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:32.160]  or America first, or anything other than whatever CNN wants,
[2:41:32.160 --> 2:41:34.480]  anything other than what Mark Zuckerberg wants,
[2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:37.840]  the only way that we can compete in the political ecosystem,
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:39.080]  the only way that we could compete
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:41.240]  in the ecosystem of information
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:43.640]  is if we have access to and control over
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:46.200]  the distribution of information through mass media.
[2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:50.120]  And of course, the logical extension of that, Nick Fuentes,
[2:41:50.120 --> 2:41:54.920]  is now CNN is saying, we want Fox News, OAN,
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:57.040]  and Newsmax taking off the cable systems.
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:41:58.280]  And it's starting to happen.
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:00.440]  There's no end to this tyranny.
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:02.960]  The bottom has just totally fallen out.
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:05.520]  And I can't believe the so-called elites
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:07.000]  are this unified in this.
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.200]  This is gonna be so dangerous for them as well.
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:12.360]  So now all these rich men that set up tyranny
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:15.720]  to consolidate power, they're now gonna be arrested
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:17.960]  like the head of Alibaba in China.
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:20.640]  They're destroying their own safety net, they're idiots.
[2:42:21.680 --> 2:42:23.760]  Well, absolutely, and the good thing is,
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:25.800]  there's actually a silver lining to that.
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:28.080]  Now that Trump has been banned off of Twitter
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:30.920]  and now that he's been de-platformed from all these things,
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:34.400]  to me, this is actually exciting, an exciting time
[2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:37.760]  because this will now draw the attention of the elites.
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:40.640]  Like you said, when you were getting banned on Twitter
[2:42:40.640 --> 2:42:42.120]  and Facebook and everything,
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:43.760]  well, a lot of mainstream conservatives
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:46.280]  didn't wanna say anything because they're cowardly.
[2:42:46.280 --> 2:42:49.440]  And oh, we don't wanna talk to Alex Jones or whatever.
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:52.440]  I mean, we all know the usual GOP types.
[2:42:52.440 --> 2:42:55.280]  And so when people are getting de-platformed-
[2:42:55.280 --> 2:42:58.360]  Even a lot of my crew, dozens of groups I was quietly funding,
[2:42:58.360 --> 2:43:01.120]  they were just supposed to promote us and sponsor us.
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:04.040]  They wouldn't promote us, but would always say they would.
[2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:06.680]  And so then when I fired them, they got mad.
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:09.920]  I'm like, you're scared to promote me, you'll be next.
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:13.000]  Can we all hang together or we hang separate?
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:14.880]  Exactly, well, and that is,
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:16.760]  I think what conservatives are realizing
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:17.880]  now that Trump was banned,
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:20.440]  they're realizing that it's only a matter of time
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:22.000]  before they come for everybody.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:24.320]  They're coming after Fox, they're coming after Tucker,
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:26.520]  they're coming after cable news stations.
[2:43:26.520 --> 2:43:28.640]  They came after the president of the United States.
[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:32.600]  And so what used to be a problem for so-called fringe people
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:34.160]  or people that were inconvenient,
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:35.640]  it's now becoming a problem for people
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:37.920]  that are very mainstream, people that are very influential.
[2:43:37.920 --> 2:43:40.600]  That's where it's always been, because they were the real targets.
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:42.720]  They want the number one show, Joe Rogan.
[2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:44.120]  Not even because it's grab his politics,
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:45.520]  they want to own people.
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:47.640]  That's right.
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:51.640]  Well, and they fear individuals that they don't control
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:53.800]  having influence over millions of people.
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:43:55.200]  What they feared about you
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:56.760]  and what they feared about Joe Rogan
[2:43:56.760 --> 2:43:59.760]  and a lot of these people is that you have your own
[2:43:59.760 --> 2:44:02.720]  totally independent infrastructure broadcasting
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:05.480]  to millions and millions of people you still do
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:06.840]  and they don't control you
[2:44:06.840 --> 2:44:08.720]  and they don't control what you say.
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:11.200]  They want to control everything that people hear.
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:13.200]  They want to control what's on their phones,
[2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:15.520]  want to control what's on their TV, on their radio.
[2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:17.400]  Well, they're freaking out that I'm pointing out
[2:44:17.400 --> 2:44:20.200]  that the Boogaloo's are still on Twitter and you and I aren't.
[2:44:20.200 --> 2:44:23.200]  And this terrorist that led the attack, this Antifa guy,
[2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:26.040]  is obviously working for the Democrats, his brother agrees.
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:27.560]  He's still on Twitter and you and I aren't,
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:28.840]  he's calling for violence.
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:30.280]  And I'm not at war with the Boogaloo's,
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:33.240]  I'm warning their members that you're being protected.
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:35.200]  That means feds are in control of you.
[2:44:35.200 --> 2:44:36.480]  Well, that's exactly right.
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:39.480]  They only protect people that are beneficial to them.
[2:44:39.480 --> 2:44:42.080]  And even if they're not, even if they're not in bed
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:44.240]  with the feds or feds themselves,
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:46.880]  if they are doing something that is useful for the feds,
[2:44:46.880 --> 2:44:47.880]  they will be protected.
[2:44:47.880 --> 2:44:50.280]  If they're doing something that's useful for the media,
[2:44:50.280 --> 2:44:51.920]  they will get covered by the media.
[2:44:51.920 --> 2:44:54.320]  You know, I used to say this about the alt-right all the time.
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:56.280]  You know, people call me alt-right a lot.
[2:44:56.280 --> 2:44:57.480]  I was never a part of that.
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:44:59.680]  We have severe disagreements or major disagreements.
[2:44:59.680 --> 2:45:00.520]  I'm the new right.
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:02.360]  And yeah, yeah, me too.
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:04.560]  We're part of the new, the new right wing.
[2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:07.360]  You know, the future is, I think, people like you and I.
[2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:09.560]  But we used to look at people like that and say,
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:11.240]  well, gee, why is it that Richard Spencer
[2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:12.560]  gets all this media coverage?
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:14.440]  Why is it that Boogaloo types?
[2:45:14.440 --> 2:45:17.800]  Why is it that these kinds of so-called right wing organizations
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:20.080]  get all this media coverage and they're talked about,
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:22.480]  they're allowed on social media, they're allowed to exist,
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:23.840]  they don't get persecuted?
[2:45:23.840 --> 2:45:27.120]  Well, it's because they are fundamentally an asset
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:29.040]  in the sense that they are advancing the cause
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:29.880]  of these differences.
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:33.680]  They are turning people away from populistic nationalism.
[2:45:33.680 --> 2:45:37.120]  The new right, just rediscovery America first.
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:40.320]  And so because they're destructive, they're protected.
[2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:41.160]  That's right.
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:42.000]  That's exactly right.
[2:45:42.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  They're moving the ball down the field
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:45.400]  for all the wrong people.
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:48.400]  And you know, the thing is about these institutions
[2:45:48.400 --> 2:45:49.600]  is they're not stupid.
[2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:51.200]  You know, say what you will about the FBI
[2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:53.480]  or Big Tech or the media, but they're not dummies.
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:55.040]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:45:56.880]  When a reporter comes to your house
[2:45:56.880 --> 2:45:58.880]  to interview you about the Capitol seat.
[2:45:58.880 --> 2:46:00.320]  They already have their agenda set.
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:02.320]  They're just pretending like they're interviewing you
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:03.320]  to look legitimate.
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:04.880]  That's right.
[2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:07.600]  And they're not going to put an interview of you on TV
[2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:08.880]  that's going to help you.
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:11.600]  They're not coming to interview Alex Jones and Nick Fuentes
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:13.880]  to help people hear our side of the story
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:15.880]  or to help us get our message out there.
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:17.960]  The only reason that they're conducting the interview
[2:46:17.960 --> 2:46:20.520]  and broadcasting the interview is because they think
[2:46:20.520 --> 2:46:22.040]  that it will benefit their agenda.
[2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:23.800]  They think it will benefit them.
[2:46:23.800 --> 2:46:27.040]  You know, the era of independent media, non-biased media,
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:29.520]  if that ever existed, it's certainly over now.
[2:46:29.520 --> 2:46:30.880]  And people have got to realize that
[2:46:30.880 --> 2:46:33.520]  and take a very close look at who's being protected,
[2:46:33.520 --> 2:46:35.640]  who's being allowed on these different things.
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:38.160]  Ultimately, then, who serves the system
[2:46:38.160 --> 2:46:39.960]  and who represents a real challenge to it.
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:42.600]  And you could tell by who's getting the most severe backlash,
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:44.280]  who's getting the media coverage,
[2:46:44.280 --> 2:46:45.760]  who's getting snitched out of the FBI.
[2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:47.480]  Exactly. All right. Tell us one more time,
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:48.760]  your new platform.
[2:46:48.760 --> 2:46:50.360]  We salute you having your own new platform.
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:52.640]  That means you're really in the elite column now.
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:53.480]  Have to do that yourself.
[2:46:53.480 --> 2:46:54.520]  People should support you.
[2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:56.400]  How do they find that, Nick?
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:46:58.760]  It's AmericaFirst.live.
[2:46:58.760 --> 2:47:01.280]  And I do my show at eight o'clock, central time,
[2:47:01.280 --> 2:47:03.600]  Monday through Friday, so I'll be on there tonight.
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:04.840]  All right, God bless you.
[2:47:04.840 --> 2:47:07.040]  Please join us if you'd like tomorrow night.
[2:47:07.040 --> 2:47:08.600]  We're gonna do extended commercial freak
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:09.920]  in over 30 minutes.
[2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:11.240]  If you can, you just pick the time.
[2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:14.120]  We're gonna be covering the post-America period
[2:47:14.120 --> 2:47:15.560]  and just admitting how much trouble we're in
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:17.760]  so we can wake up America and fix it,
[2:47:17.760 --> 2:47:20.120]  not be delusional like the Q folks say.
[2:47:20.120 --> 2:47:21.840]  God bless you and thank you.
[2:47:21.840 --> 2:47:23.440]  Thank you so much. Thanks for having me on.
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:25.000]  All right, please set him up tomorrow night.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:26.440]  We could simulcast with him for 30 minutes
[2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:28.400]  or something too if he wants to.
[2:47:28.400 --> 2:47:30.920]  Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over.
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:34.800]  I feel like I should be talking for 10 hours.
[2:47:34.800 --> 2:47:35.640]  There's so much to cover.
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:37.400]  I wanna take a lot of your calls.
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:38.480]  The crew is exhausted.
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:40.080]  We've tried to beef this operation up.
[2:47:40.080 --> 2:47:41.680]  We've never been able to do it.
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:43.800]  So we're all very, very battle hardened at this point,
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:44.840]  but also exhausted.
[2:47:45.840 --> 2:47:47.680]  And I never get sick.
[2:47:47.680 --> 2:47:50.080]  I went in for a dental appointment
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:51.480]  and I got an infection in there.
[2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:53.680]  And I feel like I'm in stab with a ice pick
[2:47:53.680 --> 2:47:57.120]  in my tonsils right now, but I'm here on air.
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:47:58.440]  So I sound a little weird today.
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:02.600]  It's because I'd like to cut my left tonsil out
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:03.640]  with a butcher knife if I could,
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:04.600]  but I'm not going to.
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:09.160]  I'm gonna go to the doctor here in a few minutes.
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:11.880]  But thank God, I mean, I've been sick in five years
[2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:12.960]  till earlier last year.
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:14.200]  Got sick a little bit.
[2:48:14.200 --> 2:48:15.240]  Probably COVID.
[2:48:15.240 --> 2:48:16.520]  Had a cough for about three, four days,
[2:48:16.520 --> 2:48:18.080]  a little bit of a fever for a day.
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:19.520]  I never get infections or problems,
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:23.360]  unless it's occasionally at a medical facility,
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:26.000]  which are the most dangerous places on earth.
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  Hour number four coming up.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:28.840]  Stay with us.
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:35.240]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain,
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:36.920]  many of the best selling products and floors
[2:48:36.920 --> 2:48:38.480]  are no longer available.
[2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:40.600]  And I thought that pollen block might be gone forever,
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:41.920]  but after eight months,
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:46.360]  we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:48.400]  The rest they hope in a few months comes in.
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:52.920]  It's proprietary system using specially fed quail
[2:48:52.920 --> 2:48:54.120]  and their eggs.
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:56.400]  It's very powerful when it comes to
[2:48:56.400 --> 2:48:58.960]  blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:01.200]  So get your pollen block back in stock
[2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:04.000]  at infowarstore.com today.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:05.120]  And by the way,
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:07.080]  activated charcoal toothpaste sold out for months,
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:08.520]  it's now back in stock as well.
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:10.480]  They're great products and it funds the info war.
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:12.720]  So get your pollen block and get your activated
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:15.160]  charcoal toothpaste at infowarstore.com today.
[2:49:15.160 --> 2:49:17.920]  Again, our activated charcoal toothpaste
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:19.880]  doesn't have additives, it's concentrated,
[2:49:19.880 --> 2:49:21.600]  people love it, it's amazing,
[2:49:21.600 --> 2:49:23.120]  there's no toothpaste out there like it.
[2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:24.960]  That pollen block is proprietary as well.
[2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:27.120]  They're back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:28.560]  infowarstore.com.
[2:49:28.560 --> 2:49:29.800]  infowarstore.com.
[2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:34.120]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:35.520]  of psychological warfare.
[2:49:35.520 --> 2:49:37.520]  The United Nations, the big corporations,
[2:49:37.520 --> 2:49:39.560]  the globalists, big tech and big farmer,
[2:49:39.560 --> 2:49:41.920]  all pushing the cup as the most deadly thing in history,
[2:49:41.920 --> 2:49:43.440]  even though statistically,
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:45.160]  it's a very weak flu or cold,
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:47.040]  but if you are deficient,
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:48.480]  then you can actually die from it.
[2:49:48.480 --> 2:49:49.800]  That's why you see somebody dying
[2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:51.000]  in some nursing homes.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:54.560]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:56.480]  and former Pfizer head medical officers
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:49:59.480]  have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine,
[2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:00.920]  especially the mRNA ones,
[2:50:00.920 --> 2:50:03.080]  are basically bio weapons that are super deadly
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:04.640]  and now they're having to resuscitate people
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:07.280]  that die basically when they take it,
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:09.560]  just like newborn babies, they give vaccines,
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:10.920]  they have to resuscitate them all the time
[2:50:10.920 --> 2:50:12.560]  or a lot of times they just let them die.
[2:50:12.560 --> 2:50:14.600]  And that's on the record, it does that.
[2:50:14.600 --> 2:50:16.960]  Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer,
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:18.160]  all these other diseases,
[2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:19.400]  but they tell you, safe and effective,
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:20.240]  no one's getting hurt,
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:21.320]  it's like a conspiracy theory,
[2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:24.840]  and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly.
[2:50:24.840 --> 2:50:26.800]  So they run from something that isn't dangerous
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:28.640]  towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[2:50:28.640 --> 2:50:30.840]  because the media says it's safe, they do it.
[2:50:34.440 --> 2:50:37.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:41.320 --> 2:50:46.320]  We are back live, all those with lancet.
[2:50:46.320 --> 2:50:49.440]  We're back live, all those with lancet.
[2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:53.040]  It's scheduled, as they say, an airstrip one
[2:50:54.040 --> 2:50:55.680]  to be hosting the next hour.
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:50:58.600]  I like the interview for his show,
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:00.440]  I'm glad he's doing interviews now.
[2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:02.920]  So Paul is taking over here in a few minutes.
[2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:06.000]  Let me just do this now or we won't be on air.
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.840]  We are funded by viewers and listeners like you
[2:51:08.840 --> 2:51:12.240]  who I salute and I thank for the bottom of my heart.
[2:51:12.240 --> 2:51:14.360]  And just because some of you got conned by the Q thing,
[2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:16.800]  I don't blame you, I've been doing this 27 years,
[2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:18.120]  I learned more now in a day
[2:51:18.120 --> 2:51:20.480]  than I used to learn in a year.
[2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:22.800]  And I didn't think they'd do a false flag,
[2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:23.760]  a break in the capitol,
[2:51:23.760 --> 2:51:25.960]  I thought they'd do a mass shooting or something
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:28.120]  when we went to DC, but still I went there
[2:51:28.120 --> 2:51:29.040]  because it was the right thing to do
[2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:30.960]  to stand against their election fraud.
[2:51:30.960 --> 2:51:33.000]  So just because you're wrong or get conned
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:35.840]  doesn't mean you're bad, what matters is your heart.
[2:51:35.840 --> 2:51:37.400]  King David had his best friend killed
[2:51:37.400 --> 2:51:39.480]  because he was in such lust for his wife,
[2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:42.160]  but he later repeated it in really minute
[2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:44.800]  and God said you're a man of his own heart.
[2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:46.760]  So I'm not judging any of you.
[2:51:46.760 --> 2:51:51.400]  I was involved in abortions when I was a teenager,
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:54.440]  not repented of that, but God forgave me.
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:51:56.680]  So I'm not here judging you, you're not bad.
[2:51:56.680 --> 2:52:00.560]  I just can't sit there and watch people conned like this.
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:05.440]  The mainstream media says Jones loved QAnon until recently.
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:06.380]  No, I didn't.
[2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:10.240]  I said, if you wanna be Q yourself and do real research
[2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:12.360]  and wanna take the movement over, that's great,
[2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:14.560]  but whoever's running this eight-chamboard,
[2:52:14.560 --> 2:52:17.600]  whoever's putting this out, that's manipulating you.
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:19.080]  And now you see what's happened.
[2:52:20.080 --> 2:52:21.680]  But the Q folks didn't launch the attack.
[2:52:21.680 --> 2:52:23.800]  They were just used as the cannon fodder
[2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:24.880]  so they could have people to arrest
[2:52:24.880 --> 2:52:27.320]  so they wouldn't have to arrest their actual federal officers
[2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:30.480]  and federal agents and provocateurs that went in.
[2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:32.240]  So I may have given it to Q a little too much
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:33.800]  in the last two weeks, but I was really pissed.
[2:52:33.800 --> 2:52:37.080]  I was set up, I was there, and it tore my heart out
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:39.640]  to see those million Americans or so
[2:52:39.640 --> 2:52:42.120]  that came peacefully with children, many of them,
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:44.000]  and to watch a few hundred idiots
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:45.480]  and the police stand down and get away with that.
[2:52:45.480 --> 2:52:46.880]  It was terrible.
[2:52:46.880 --> 2:52:49.400]  And then actually, bad at dying, it was just terrible.
[2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:51.120]  But I'll just keep trying to do the best job I can.
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:52.680]  I'm not perfect either.
[2:52:52.680 --> 2:52:54.580]  Separately, vitamin mineral fusion
[2:52:54.580 --> 2:52:58.560]  is a liquid vitamin mineral with Q amino acids.
[2:52:58.560 --> 2:53:01.320]  It is the best, highest quality vitamins and minerals
[2:53:01.320 --> 2:53:02.240]  we can find.
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:04.120]  This is a top-end product.
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:06.840]  A large part of what you pay is the product.
[2:53:06.840 --> 2:53:10.160]  I could have put out a canister of high-quality
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:12.240]  vitamin mineral stuff that wasn't high-quality
[2:53:12.240 --> 2:53:13.480]  for a couple bucks.
[2:53:13.480 --> 2:53:15.200]  This didn't have a couple bucks in it.
[2:53:15.200 --> 2:53:17.840]  It's got a lot, lot more than that in there.
[2:53:17.840 --> 2:53:20.880]  And so it's high-end stuff.
[2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:22.240]  You absorb it better into your body.
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:23.360]  It's got the vitamin D3.
[2:53:23.360 --> 2:53:24.400]  It's got the zinc.
[2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:25.240]  It's got the vitamin C.
[2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:28.360]  It's got every essential vitamin, every essential mineral,
[2:53:28.360 --> 2:53:30.920]  and then it's got all of the Q amino acids
[2:53:30.920 --> 2:53:32.440]  to help it upload into your body
[2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:33.880]  that are known in the studies to do it.
[2:53:33.880 --> 2:53:36.960]  For my immune system, for my body's defenses,
[2:53:36.960 --> 2:53:39.080]  I just, every couple days, we have a little pitcher,
[2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:41.440]  glass pitcher, sometimes my wife puts it away,
[2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:42.880]  we have a plastic one.
[2:53:42.880 --> 2:53:44.880]  And I put a few scoops in, put water in,
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:46.680]  put some ice things, I want it right away,
[2:53:46.680 --> 2:53:49.880]  pour myself a glass, put the rest of the refrigerator,
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:52.120]  and I drink it in the morning or I drink it in the evening,
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:53.040]  sometimes twice a day,
[2:53:53.040 --> 2:53:55.720]  and you absorb almost all of it that way.
[2:53:55.720 --> 2:53:57.560]  Vitamin mineral fusion is back in stock,
[2:53:57.560 --> 2:54:00.280]  and we got a limited supply of this
[2:54:00.280 --> 2:54:03.800]  because of COVID-19 supply chain breakdowns.
[2:54:03.800 --> 2:54:06.160]  So we got half the order in we were supposed to.
[2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:08.000]  It'll be eight weeks till we get more.
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:09.760]  This will sell out way before eight weeks
[2:54:09.760 --> 2:54:11.320]  because it's a 50% off.
[2:54:11.320 --> 2:54:13.160]  We know if I sell it at full price,
[2:54:14.560 --> 2:54:16.000]  it will still sell out in eight weeks.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:18.840]  But I am selling it at 50% off
[2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:21.160]  because I want people on the fence to get it
[2:54:21.160 --> 2:54:23.680]  and see how amazing it is and protect yourself
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:25.440]  with something that's vital,
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:27.760]  that is an essential vitamin mineral package.
[2:54:27.760 --> 2:54:30.040]  So, and then I believe you'll become a big fan of it
[2:54:30.040 --> 2:54:30.960]  and keep reordering it.
[2:54:30.960 --> 2:54:32.760]  So it's the right thing to do,
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:35.800]  but it's also something I found that's very successful.
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:37.800]  I just morally feel like I should sell it
[2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:41.040]  at the lowest price possible so all of you can get it.
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:43.000]  Winter sun is almost sold out.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:44.080]  We're gonna get more of that in as well.
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:46.640]  It's super high quality D3, it is the key.
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:48.560]  DNA force is almost sold out.
[2:54:48.560 --> 2:54:49.840]  And we're gonna have to end the specials.
[2:54:49.840 --> 2:54:51.080]  This is our new special.
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:53.720]  We're gonna have to end the specials in a few days
[2:54:53.720 --> 2:54:56.120]  on the Big Mega special.
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:54:57.480]  The Globalist Storm is here.
[2:54:57.480 --> 2:54:59.160]  It's an extension of the New Year special.
[2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:01.120]  There's a bunch of these are closest selling out.
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:04.040]  Supermell Vitality, X2, Alpha Power,
[2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:07.840]  Chill Force, Lund Cleanse, Survival Shield,
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:10.200]  X3, Pure Tumeric, Liquid Extract,
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:12.480]  all 50% off, bunch of other stuff too.
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:15.320]  It's gonna have to go up in price, it's 25% off.
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:17.320]  Stuff like pollen blocks about to sell out.
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:21.560]  Infowarstore.com or AAA-253-33139.
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:23.520]  I wanna thank you all for your support.
[2:55:23.520 --> 2:55:24.960]  Paul Joseph Watson is taking over
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:26.440]  the Owen Schreuer at 3 p.m. today.
[2:55:26.440 --> 2:55:29.000]  And then tomorrow, we're gonna go live at 8 a.m.,
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.800]  right into 10 p.m., commercial free,
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:33.680]  starting during the inauguration
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:35.520]  of the CHICOM DECTOR, stay with us.
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:42.720]  This is Greg Rees from infowars.com.
[2:55:42.720 --> 2:55:44.720]  I have many reasons to be grateful
[2:55:44.720 --> 2:55:46.680]  for working at InfoWars.
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:49.040]  One of them is that we support ourselves
[2:55:49.040 --> 2:55:50.760]  with great products that promote
[2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:52.560]  physical health and vitality.
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:56.640]  I've been using health supplements for years.
[2:55:56.640 --> 2:55:59.800]  And I have found our products at infowarsstore.com
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:04.720]  to be the best, especially our vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:07.160]  Before trying vitamin mineral fusion,
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:09.400]  I always questioned if vitamin supplements
[2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:11.240]  ever actually did anything.
[2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:14.880]  I never felt much of an effect from other products.
[2:56:14.880 --> 2:56:16.720]  But I felt vitamin mineral fusion
[2:56:16.720 --> 2:56:19.840]  the first time I took it, immediately.
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:21.880]  I love how it dissolves in water.
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:23.720]  I take it every day with my supper.
[2:56:23.720 --> 2:56:26.320]  It tastes great, feels great.
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:29.080]  And right now, it's 50% off.
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:33.320]  It sells out fast, so stock up now at 50% off
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:35.680]  at infowarsstore.com.
[2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:39.160]  Vitamin mineral fusion at infowarsstore.com.
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:46.960]  Transmuting worldwide from the summit.new studios
[2:56:46.960 --> 2:56:49.760]  in the United Kingdom, you are listening
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:52.040]  to Pearl Joseph Watson.
[2:56:52.040 --> 2:56:59.040]  Hello, everybody, and welcome back to the Summit News Hour.
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:01.080]  Later on in the show, we're going to get into
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:02.960]  the continued hysterical freakout
[2:57:02.960 --> 2:57:06.600]  over the aftermath of what happened at the Capitol Building.
[2:57:06.600 --> 2:57:09.720]  Now, with blue checkmarks on Twitter,
[2:57:09.720 --> 2:57:12.160]  literally claiming that Trump is going to lead
[2:57:12.160 --> 2:57:14.960]  a domestic terrorist army
[2:57:14.960 --> 2:57:17.920]  to overthrow the administration of Joe Biden,
[2:57:17.920 --> 2:57:22.000]  calling for the creation of a citizen spy network
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:24.760]  of Americans snitching on Americans
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:26.280]  that could, by the looks of it,
[2:57:26.280 --> 2:57:28.160]  rival the East German Starsy
[2:57:28.160 --> 2:57:30.560]  if it ever got off the ground.
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:32.920]  We have more social deplatforming news.
[2:57:32.920 --> 2:57:36.440]  It now appears that Laura Luma has been put
[2:57:36.440 --> 2:57:40.560]  on a federal no-buy list in terms of buying firearms,
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:41.800]  which again goes back to the point
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:44.640]  that this isn't just about restricting people's access
[2:57:44.640 --> 2:57:45.600]  to social media.
[2:57:45.600 --> 2:57:50.200]  It's about creating the social credit score in America,
[2:57:50.200 --> 2:57:52.120]  where you're not allowed to buy a plane ticket,
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:54.680]  a plane ticket, a train ticket,
[2:57:54.680 --> 2:57:58.440]  where you're not allowed to get insurance to buy a car
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:57:59.760]  or to mortgage a home,
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:02.360]  as we saw with Kurt Schilling last week.
[2:58:02.360 --> 2:58:06.000]  Now it appears she's been put on a no-gun buy list.
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:06.920]  We're going to get into that.
[2:58:06.920 --> 2:58:09.760]  We're going to get into the comeback of Paula,
[2:58:09.760 --> 2:58:11.160]  which looks like it's going to happen
[2:58:11.160 --> 2:58:12.280]  by the end of this month.
[2:58:12.280 --> 2:58:14.840]  They haven't managed to completely obliterate it
[2:58:14.840 --> 2:58:16.480]  from the internet.
[2:58:16.480 --> 2:58:17.680]  But now the big scandal is,
[2:58:17.680 --> 2:58:20.560]  oh, they're using a Cloudflare-type service
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:24.640]  that prevents DDoS attacks that is based in Russia.
[2:58:24.640 --> 2:58:27.200]  So they can't use any services that are based in America
[2:58:27.200 --> 2:58:30.240]  or the West, because of course they get D-platformed
[2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:32.920]  off the back of vitriolic Twitter hate mobs
[2:58:32.920 --> 2:58:35.560]  going after Amazon and all these other companies
[2:58:35.560 --> 2:58:37.280]  who immediately cave.
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:39.480]  So then you go offshore to a different country
[2:58:39.480 --> 2:58:40.560]  to try and use a service,
[2:58:40.560 --> 2:58:43.040]  and then you're in league with the Russians.
[2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:44.600]  And that's reinvigorated the whole
[2:58:44.600 --> 2:58:48.480]  demented Russian interference conspiracy theory,
[2:58:48.480 --> 2:58:50.720]  which was of course voiced for years
[2:58:50.720 --> 2:58:52.960]  without any evidence whatsoever by the same people
[2:58:52.960 --> 2:58:56.480]  who are now saying that it should be a banable offense,
[2:58:56.480 --> 2:58:59.400]  an offense that should get people ostracized from society
[2:58:59.400 --> 2:59:02.000]  to question the legitimacy of an election,
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.480]  despite the fact that they've literally been doing that
[2:59:04.480 --> 2:59:06.040]  for the past four years.
[2:59:07.240 --> 2:59:09.360]  But as ever, we continue in the West
[2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:13.760]  and in my country, the UK, to labor under lockdown.
[2:59:13.760 --> 2:59:16.680]  The third lockdown so far in the United Kingdom,
[2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:18.800]  because the first two worked so well,
[2:59:20.480 --> 2:59:22.680]  they're talking about putting Trump supporters in camps
[2:59:22.680 --> 2:59:25.160]  who reeducate them to de-radicalize them.
[2:59:25.160 --> 2:59:28.680]  We're also talking about putting them in camps in Germany
[2:59:28.680 --> 2:59:31.720]  if they dissent against the COVID consensus.
[2:59:31.720 --> 2:59:35.800]  And now they're actually repurposing refugee camps,
[2:59:35.800 --> 2:59:38.240]  which haven't been used as of late
[2:59:38.240 --> 2:59:42.960]  to keep COVID dissidents ostracized, separated,
[2:59:42.960 --> 2:59:45.360]  removed from the rest of society.
[2:59:45.360 --> 2:59:47.200]  We're gonna get into that.
[2:59:47.200 --> 2:59:49.960]  But first, I wanna start off with this,
[2:59:49.960 --> 2:59:53.120]  because it's one of the top headlines up at summit.news.
[2:59:53.120 --> 2:59:55.560]  Due to Harvard and John Hopkins experts,
[2:59:55.560 --> 3:00:00.160]  COVID lockdowns will cause one million excess deaths.
[3:00:00.160 --> 3:00:01.600]  We've been hopping on about this
[3:00:01.600 --> 3:00:04.400]  for the best part of 10 months.
[3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:06.640]  Nobody in government is listening.
[3:00:06.640 --> 3:00:08.800]  They're still following the same policies
[3:00:08.800 --> 3:00:12.960]  that were enshrined by communist police state China
[3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:15.040]  with no room for debate whatsoever.
[3:00:15.040 --> 3:00:17.280]  Despite the fact that we continue to have,
[3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:18.960]  in the background,
[3:00:18.960 --> 3:00:21.800]  they don't tend to get much network media coverage.
[3:00:21.800 --> 3:00:22.880]  Imagine my shock.
[3:00:23.720 --> 3:00:26.400]  Peer-reviewed studies that show lockdown doesn't work,
[3:00:26.400 --> 3:00:30.960]  and in fact could even be more harmful in the long term
[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:32.560]  than the coronavirus itself.
[3:00:32.560 --> 3:00:33.840]  It says academics from Duke,
[3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:36.960]  Harvard and Johns Hopkins have concluded
[3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:38.880]  that there could be around a million excess deaths
[3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:42.400]  over the next two decades as a result of lockdowns.
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:46.360]  And this article, by the way, is basically the Rosetta Stone.
[3:00:46.360 --> 3:00:49.000]  For the myriad of experts who have argued
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.760]  or have made the same case over the past 10 months
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:53.960]  and largely being ignored,
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:56.320]  there's an NBER working paper entitled
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:00:58.960]  The Long Term Impact of the COVID-19 Unemployment
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:02.640]  Shock on Life, Expectancy and Mortality Rates,
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:04.480]  suggests that for the overall population,
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:07.600]  the increase in death rate following the COVID-19 pandemic
[3:01:07.600 --> 3:01:13.600]  implies a staggering 0.89 and 1.37 million excess deaths
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:17.480]  over the next 15 and 20 years, respectively.
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:18.760]  Now, other studies have shown
[3:01:18.760 --> 3:01:21.360]  that it could cause even more deaths than that
[3:01:21.360 --> 3:01:23.560]  in an even shorter time frame.
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:26.840]  But this study looked into how unemployment
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:28.920]  affects mortality and life expectancy,
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:32.880]  and it was centered around 67 years of data about unemployment,
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:36.280]  because as the argument continually needs to be made,
[3:01:36.280 --> 3:01:40.960]  unemployment causes poverty, poverty causes death,
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:44.520]  especially in the third world where even the UN has said,
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:47.240]  I think they said it was in the hundreds of millions
[3:01:47.240 --> 3:01:49.040]  of people who would eventually die
[3:01:49.040 --> 3:01:51.200]  as a result of extreme poverty
[3:01:51.200 --> 3:01:54.440]  caused by coronavirus lockdowns.
[3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:56.440]  This paper suggests that deaths caused
[3:01:56.440 --> 3:01:58.680]  by the economic and societal decline
[3:01:58.680 --> 3:02:00.360]  as a result of lockdowns may, quote,
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:03.440]  far exceed those immediately related
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:06.800]  to the acute COVID-19 critical illness.
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:08.040]  It says the recession caused
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:10.520]  by the pandemic and jeopardized population health
[3:02:10.520 --> 3:02:13.440]  for the next two decades.
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:15.280]  And we go on into this article,
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:17.000]  which is why I say it's the Rosetta Stone,
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:20.320]  to include basically every other example
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:23.320]  where peer-reviewed studies' top experts
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:25.520]  have said the same thing.
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:28.040]  We had Germany's Minister of Economic Cooperation
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:30.680]  and Development, Gerd Muller,
[3:02:30.680 --> 3:02:33.040]  last year, I believe it was in September,
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:35.560]  warning that COVID-19 lockdowns will result in, quote,
[3:02:35.560 --> 3:02:39.960]  one of the biggest hunger and poverty crises in history.
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:43.160]  He said, we expect an additional 400,000 deaths
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:45.200]  from malaria and HIV this year
[3:02:45.200 --> 3:02:46.920]  on the African continent alone,
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:49.320]  because liberals and leftists care so much
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:51.520]  about black people in the third world, right?
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:56.480]  Well, 400,000 of them are gonna die from malaria and HIV
[3:02:56.480 --> 3:02:58.440]  because of the same lockdown policies
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:00.160]  that you vehemently support
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:03.280]  while claiming the sanctimonious moral high ground
[3:03:03.280 --> 3:03:05.920]  and claiming you're a double plus good person
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:07.280]  for wearing a mask in public.
[3:03:07.280 --> 3:03:08.960]  And I'm gonna get onto the masks, by the way,
[3:03:08.960 --> 3:03:09.800]  in the next segment
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:13.040]  because some more interesting news about that.
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:17.040]  But in addition to these peer-reviewed studies,
[3:03:17.040 --> 3:03:18.920]  we had another study which found lockdowns
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:22.600]  will conservatively destroy at least seven times more years
[3:03:22.600 --> 3:03:25.280]  of human life than they serve.
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:26.680]  Professor Richard Sullivan,
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:28.560]  the top cancer expert in the UK,
[3:03:28.560 --> 3:03:30.400]  also said there would be more.
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:33.960]  Excess cancer deaths, that's cancer deaths alone,
[3:03:33.960 --> 3:03:36.520]  in the UK than total coronavirus deaths
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:38.320]  due to people's access to screenings
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:40.640]  and treatment being restricted.
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:43.480]  And of course, people avoiding hospitals
[3:03:43.480 --> 3:03:46.160]  because they're so paranoid about getting COVID.
[3:03:46.160 --> 3:03:48.440]  And to be fair, it's a reasonable concern
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:51.120]  given that the vast majority of cases,
[3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:53.520]  new infections of coronavirus emerge
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:55.360]  in hospitals and care homes.
[3:03:55.360 --> 3:03:57.680]  They don't happen in pubs and restaurants,
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:03:59.160]  but it's the pubs and restaurants
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:01.640]  that get locked down time and time again.
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:03.680]  Meanwhile, as we've seen from footage
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:04.920]  that we've played over and over again,
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:08.120]  which for filming some people have been arrested,
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:10.000]  some of the hospitals, let's just say,
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:12.240]  aren't exactly overflowing.
[3:04:12.240 --> 3:04:15.240]  We also had Professor Carol Sakura,
[3:04:15.240 --> 3:04:17.680]  an NHS consultant oncologist.
[3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:21.320]  Again, these are not wacky, demented COVID deniers.
[3:04:21.320 --> 3:04:25.040]  These are people within your own system saying this,
[3:04:25.040 --> 3:04:28.240]  that there could be 50 excess deaths from cancer
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:30.480]  during lockdown in the UK.
[3:04:30.480 --> 3:04:32.360]  Even a guardian analysis has found
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:33.840]  there have been thousands of excess deaths
[3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:37.040]  of people at home in the UK due to the lockdown.
[3:04:37.040 --> 3:04:39.360]  And I haven't got into the TB deaths.
[3:04:39.360 --> 3:04:41.120]  Of course, the UN came out and said
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:44.560]  1.4 million extra TB deaths globally.
[3:04:44.560 --> 3:04:46.800]  Again, as a result of lockdown,
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:49.640]  we haven't even got into the mental health impact
[3:04:49.640 --> 3:04:51.240]  that this will have.
[3:04:51.240 --> 3:04:54.120]  And of course, the rapid increase in suicides,
[3:04:54.120 --> 3:04:58.400]  especially of young people that were already seeing uptick.
[3:04:58.400 --> 3:05:00.160]  Meanwhile, peer reviewed study,
[3:05:00.160 --> 3:05:02.720]  another one shows COVID lockdowns
[3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:05.480]  have no benefits compared to voluntary measures.
[3:05:05.480 --> 3:05:08.120]  This was by Stanford University,
[3:05:08.120 --> 3:05:11.400]  yet more wacky, demented COVID deniers,
[3:05:11.400 --> 3:05:12.960]  who found that mandatory lockdowns
[3:05:12.960 --> 3:05:14.240]  do not provide more benefits
[3:05:14.240 --> 3:05:16.320]  to stopping the spread of COVID-19
[3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:19.960]  than voluntary measures such as social distancing,
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:24.160]  such as the ones that have been applied in Sweden, of course,
[3:05:24.160 --> 3:05:26.880]  which has a lower death rate than the UK,
[3:05:26.880 --> 3:05:29.480]  no masks, no masks on public transport,
[3:05:29.480 --> 3:05:31.280]  no nationwide lockdowns,
[3:05:31.280 --> 3:05:34.800]  yet lower death rate in Sweden and other countries
[3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:37.760]  which followed a similar path such as South Korea.
[3:05:37.760 --> 3:05:39.200]  This study compared countries
[3:05:39.200 --> 3:05:41.120]  that had imposed mandatory lockdowns
[3:05:41.120 --> 3:05:43.560]  strict to ones like England, France, and Germany,
[3:05:43.560 --> 3:05:46.880]  with others such as Sweden and South Korea that hadn't.
[3:05:46.880 --> 3:05:48.720]  After analyzing the data,
[3:05:48.720 --> 3:05:50.360]  researchers found, quote,
[3:05:50.360 --> 3:05:53.640]  no clear significant beneficial effect
[3:05:53.640 --> 3:05:58.560]  of more restrictive measures on case growth in any country.
[3:05:58.560 --> 3:06:00.120]  They said they do not question the role
[3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:01.680]  of all public health interventions,
[3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:05.320]  but insisted stay-at-home orders and business closures
[3:06:05.320 --> 3:06:09.280]  had no additional impact on lowering the spread of the virus.
[3:06:09.280 --> 3:06:10.440]  So according to this study,
[3:06:10.440 --> 3:06:13.080]  according to numerous other peer reviewed studies released
[3:06:13.080 --> 3:06:14.800]  just in the past few days,
[3:06:14.800 --> 3:06:18.480]  lockdowns have no impact on lowering the spread of the virus,
[3:06:18.480 --> 3:06:20.520]  but then we know they do have an impact
[3:06:20.520 --> 3:06:24.320]  in causing massive untold death, depression,
[3:06:24.320 --> 3:06:27.200]  suicide, misery that we're already experiencing
[3:06:27.200 --> 3:06:29.120]  and will continue to experience
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:31.600]  over the next couple of decades.
[3:06:31.600 --> 3:06:33.240]  I'm gonna get into masks on the other side,
[3:06:33.240 --> 3:06:36.960]  don't go away, submit, got news, we'll be right back.
[3:06:36.960 --> 3:06:41.320]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[3:06:41.320 --> 3:06:42.640]  I just love it.
[3:06:42.640 --> 3:06:43.960]  I can't get enough of it.
[3:06:44.880 --> 3:06:47.080]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[3:06:47.080 --> 3:06:48.320]  That's what fills my mug.
[3:06:48.320 --> 3:06:49.480]  That's what fills my belly.
[3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:50.920]  That's what fills my soul.
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:52.880]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[3:06:52.880 --> 3:06:55.800]  Folks, we have had this coffee for years
[3:06:55.800 --> 3:06:57.560]  at infowarstore.com, years.
[3:06:57.560 --> 3:06:59.640]  Never raised the price, never.
[3:06:59.640 --> 3:07:02.160]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee.
[3:07:02.160 --> 3:07:03.320]  The crew here loves it.
[3:07:03.320 --> 3:07:04.520]  We drink it every day.
[3:07:04.520 --> 3:07:07.160]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways
[3:07:07.160 --> 3:07:09.160]  you can support info wars here.
[3:07:09.160 --> 3:07:11.520]  Everybody drinks coffee or just about everybody.
[3:07:11.520 --> 3:07:13.160]  Why not support info wars
[3:07:13.160 --> 3:07:15.360]  and keep the coffee supply at your house
[3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:17.280]  with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend.
[3:07:17.280 --> 3:07:18.680]  Of course, read all the great reviews.
[3:07:18.680 --> 3:07:21.040]  Pretty much perfect review there, 4.9 star.
[3:07:21.040 --> 3:07:22.560]  When you have thousands of reviews,
[3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:24.480]  it's impossible to have a perfect review
[3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:26.760]  unless literally everybody gives it five stars.
[3:07:26.760 --> 3:07:27.920]  So I mean, if you have 4.9,
[3:07:27.920 --> 3:07:29.680]  that's pretty much everybody who gives it five stars,
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:30.680]  except maybe one or two people.
[3:07:30.680 --> 3:07:33.320]  Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee,
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:37.320]  only available at infowarsstore.com.
[3:07:37.320 --> 3:07:39.320]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased,
[3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:40.160]  but I'm gonna tell you all now,
[3:07:40.160 --> 3:07:42.520]  if you haven't tried Turbo Force, you need to try it.
[3:07:42.520 --> 3:07:45.280]  I've tried Turbo Force with everything.
[3:07:45.280 --> 3:07:47.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy,
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:48.680]  I put Turbo Force in my coffee.
[3:07:48.680 --> 3:07:50.720]  That was a crazy week, I don't remember sleeping,
[3:07:50.720 --> 3:07:52.160]  but as far as the products go,
[3:07:52.160 --> 3:07:53.320]  Turbo Force is my favorite
[3:07:53.320 --> 3:07:55.400]  and all the info wars products are down to,
[3:07:55.400 --> 3:07:58.400]  take control of your life, take control of your health,
[3:07:58.400 --> 3:08:01.240]  not relying on other people to do it for you.
[3:08:01.240 --> 3:08:02.840]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[3:08:04.080 --> 3:08:05.800]  and thinks I'm gonna give that person over there
[3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:06.640]  a better life.
[3:08:06.640 --> 3:08:07.880]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[3:08:07.880 --> 3:08:09.480]  I'm gonna spend my entire day
[3:08:09.480 --> 3:08:10.760]  trying to make that guy over there
[3:08:10.760 --> 3:08:12.120]  healthier, happier and richer.
[3:08:12.120 --> 3:08:14.480]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[3:08:14.480 --> 3:08:15.880]  I don't think that happens very often.
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:16.720]  It's never happened to me.
[3:08:16.720 --> 3:08:18.160]  I never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[3:08:18.160 --> 3:08:19.520]  Tate, you're such a good guy.
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:21.400]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:08:21.400 --> 3:08:23.360]  There's only one person who woke up and fought that
[3:08:23.360 --> 3:08:24.200]  and that was me.
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:25.360]  I woke up and thought, you know what?
[3:08:25.360 --> 3:08:27.080]  Okay, I wanna take control of my life,
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:28.240]  I wanna take control of my health
[3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:29.800]  and that's why you need to go to infowars.com,
[3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:30.840]  take control of your health right now
[3:08:30.840 --> 3:08:32.120]  and support the resistance.
[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:33.280]  Don't buy into the group thing,
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:35.400]  don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the Turbo Force.
[3:08:35.400 --> 3:08:37.400]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[3:08:37.400 --> 3:08:44.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:49.240 --> 3:08:52.800]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:54.800]  with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:02.080]  Now, anyone who's dared to venture outside
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:03.960]  during these national lockouts
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:07.080]  because it's so dangerous and deadly out there as we know
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:09.040]  has come a crop, time and time again,
[3:09:09.040 --> 3:09:11.440]  has come into contact with the permanently
[3:09:11.440 --> 3:09:14.120]  petrified mask zealots.
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:18.120]  Now, outside of the debate as to whether masks work or not,
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:20.480]  given the infections that we've seen in the UK
[3:09:20.480 --> 3:09:22.040]  and other European countries,
[3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:27.040]  after masks were made mandatory in the UK inside shops
[3:09:27.040 --> 3:09:28.960]  and other internal areas,
[3:09:28.960 --> 3:09:31.000]  of course in other countries like Spain,
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:32.960]  you have to wear them everywhere.
[3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:35.600]  I've seen people hiking up mountains wearing masks
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:37.480]  but I'm going to get into that in a minute.
[3:09:37.480 --> 3:09:40.040]  But you've come into contact with these people.
[3:09:40.040 --> 3:09:44.640]  Generally speaking, they fit the classic Karen stereotype.
[3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:47.120]  Middle-aged white women.
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:48.680]  I came across one the other day.
[3:09:48.680 --> 3:09:51.200]  I was leaving my apartment building.
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:54.280]  She was to put the trash out.
[3:09:54.280 --> 3:09:55.840]  She was coming out of the building.
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:09:59.240]  So she was wearing the mask inside the apartment building
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:01.920]  to come out of her own flat.
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:04.760]  She's probably wearing it in her own flat for all I know.
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:07.240]  She's probably got a hazmat suit at this point.
[3:10:07.240 --> 3:10:09.560]  Again, so I just put the trash out,
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:12.760]  walked back towards the entry to the apartment block
[3:10:12.760 --> 3:10:14.720]  and she's like completely transfixed
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:16.440]  and doesn't know what to do.
[3:10:16.440 --> 3:10:18.760]  You know, it's like that they live clip.
[3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:20.680]  We've got one that can see
[3:10:20.680 --> 3:10:23.520]  and it's this look in their eyes and I've seen it.
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:27.800]  This petrified, terrified, perplexed look.
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:29.440]  Like they've seen a ghost or something
[3:10:29.440 --> 3:10:32.040]  if you get within 10 feet of them.
[3:10:32.040 --> 3:10:34.160]  And she like gives me a wide berth
[3:10:34.160 --> 3:10:36.120]  which you could drive up.
[3:10:36.120 --> 3:10:38.480]  You could fly at 747 through.
[3:10:39.520 --> 3:10:41.400]  As I go back into the building
[3:10:41.400 --> 3:10:43.880]  and I'm like thinking, what the hell is she doing?
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:47.240]  She's just looking at me like she's seen a ghost
[3:10:47.240 --> 3:10:50.040]  and I'm thinking, what are you doing?
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:53.600]  So I go back in, I hold the door open for her
[3:10:53.600 --> 3:10:56.440]  because presumably she's trying to get back in the apartment
[3:10:56.440 --> 3:10:59.240]  and she's like, no, no, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.
[3:10:59.240 --> 3:11:01.640]  And she's like, won't even touch the door
[3:11:01.640 --> 3:11:03.960]  as I'm holding it open for her
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:05.680]  while wearing this mask
[3:11:05.680 --> 3:11:08.620]  and this transfixed look of terror in her eyes.
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:12.840]  You know, I told the story last time, I was jogging.
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:16.240]  I was jogging very slowly towards a group
[3:11:16.240 --> 3:11:18.320]  of about three people, again, avoiding them.
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:19.920]  I wasn't running into them.
[3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:22.480]  One of them literally leapt out of the way
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:24.320]  and shrieked in panic.
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:27.960]  That's not the first time that's happened.
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:30.000]  And I'm gonna get into the exercise aspect
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:31.600]  of this mask wearing in a second
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:36.600]  but I wanna start off with this headline out of Summit.News.
[3:11:37.280 --> 3:11:41.720]  Professor of medicine brags about wearing two face masks
[3:11:41.720 --> 3:11:45.200]  to inauguration despite having been vaccinated.
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:47.880]  You see, it's not good enough now to prove
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:50.480]  that you're a good, wholesome, morally righteous,
[3:11:50.480 --> 3:11:54.000]  upstanding person who cares about the community
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:56.520]  by wearing just one mask.
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:12:00.560]  Now you need to wear two, even if you've taken the vaccine.
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:01.920]  So wait a minute.
[3:12:01.920 --> 3:12:03.680]  We're told the masks are effective
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:06.400]  in stopping the spread of coronavirus
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:08.040]  and we're told that vaccines are effective
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:10.040]  in stopping the spread of coronavirus.
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:15.120]  So if masks are effective, why are you wearing another one?
[3:12:15.120 --> 3:12:16.360]  Then you're telling the world
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:18.720]  that the first one doesn't work properly
[3:12:18.720 --> 3:12:20.040]  and if you've had the vaccine,
[3:12:20.040 --> 3:12:21.920]  why are you wearing the mask anyway?
[3:12:23.720 --> 3:12:26.440]  This is a CNN guest, a regular CNN guest
[3:12:26.440 --> 3:12:29.920]  and a medical doctor from what I could tell by her bio,
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:33.840]  a professor of medicine who bragged
[3:12:33.840 --> 3:12:36.080]  about wearing two face masks
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:38.680]  to attend Joe Biden's inauguration
[3:12:38.680 --> 3:12:41.760]  despite having already received a COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:12:41.760 --> 3:12:43.840]  Now, as it's always the case,
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:45.520]  they end up deleting the tweets,
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:47.120]  but I got a screenshot of it.
[3:12:48.040 --> 3:12:50.240]  This is Megan L. Ranny who posted a photo
[3:12:50.240 --> 3:12:52.600]  of herself wearing two masks alongside the words,
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:56.200]  off I go to the inauguration with an old N95
[3:12:56.200 --> 3:12:57.640]  under my cloth mask.
[3:12:57.640 --> 3:13:00.200]  And she's wearing two TbGb's from being in an airport
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:02.240]  despite being fully vaccinated.
[3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:04.680]  So can you imagine the terror?
[3:13:04.680 --> 3:13:06.400]  The terror that this woman,
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:10.960]  and again, classic middle-aged white woman, Karen,
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:13.720]  the terror that she has in moving in an environment
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:16.040]  where there are other people, my God, the horror.
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:19.840]  However, respondents to the tweet slammed Ranny
[3:13:19.840 --> 3:13:21.440]  for her hysterical overreaction
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:24.960]  and apparent desperation for social media clout,
[3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:27.600]  which we also see from a lot of nurses recently,
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:30.200]  others question why she would need to wear two masks
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:34.680]  while vaccinated if masks and vaccines were effective.
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:37.960]  Presumably, if wearing one mask makes you a good person,
[3:13:37.960 --> 3:13:42.040]  wearing two masks makes you a double plus good person.
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:45.160]  Others pointed out that aside from the debate
[3:13:45.160 --> 3:13:47.600]  about whether or not masks are actually effective
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:49.400]  in stopping the spread of COVID,
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:51.640]  this is the latest example of a leftist
[3:13:51.640 --> 3:13:53.360]  betraying the fact that the base mask
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:56.160]  has become the latest insipid token
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:00.040]  of sanctimonious virtue signaling and obedience.
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:03.360]  Of course, she later deleted the tweet.
[3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:04.920]  There we have the previous example
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:08.080]  of a brave, courageous, morally upstanding citizen
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:12.040]  doing his part for the community by wearing two face masks
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:14.560]  and tweeting it for social media clout and dopamine,
[3:14:14.560 --> 3:14:16.800]  which is obviously more important.
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:18.440]  Of course, we had the BBC last week
[3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:21.920]  telling people to wear face masks during sex.
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:25.480]  Yes, that was actually on the BBC News website.
[3:14:25.480 --> 3:14:28.680]  Of course, they don't seem too bothered
[3:14:28.680 --> 3:14:31.080]  about the fact that these masks,
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:33.960]  by the way, people just drop them on the street willy-nilly.
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:36.080]  I see about 20 masks on the street
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:39.840]  if I go within 100 meters of my building.
[3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:41.680]  And they don't seem to be too concerned either
[3:14:41.680 --> 3:14:44.120]  about the fact that masks will contribute
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:48.560]  an estimated 7,000 tons of plastic to the oceans
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:51.360]  and take 450 years to break down.
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:53.520]  But people are just throwing them on the streets.
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:54.960]  They're ending up in rivers.
[3:14:54.960 --> 3:14:56.400]  They're ending up in the sea,
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:14:58.880]  adding to that giant island of plastic
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:00.800]  that's floating around.
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:02.440]  Nobody really cares about that.
[3:15:02.440 --> 3:15:07.280]  What they care about is clout and dopamine on Twitter.com.
[3:15:07.280 --> 3:15:09.280]  Then we have the exercise question.
[3:15:09.280 --> 3:15:13.360]  I'm seeing more and more people every single day
[3:15:13.360 --> 3:15:16.640]  in the park doing vigorous exercise,
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:20.000]  running while wearing face masks.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.960]  Okay, even the World Health Organization
[3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:25.000]  has told people again and again
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.400]  that this is dangerous and not to do it.
[3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:29.360]  But again, it's not about danger.
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:30.560]  It's not about health.
[3:15:30.560 --> 3:15:33.160]  It's about being a good person
[3:15:33.160 --> 3:15:35.920]  and then getting the dopamine and social media clout.
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:38.000]  This is from theconversation.com.
[3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:40.280]  When we do heavy exercise,
[3:15:40.280 --> 3:15:42.160]  our muscles produce lactic acid
[3:15:42.160 --> 3:15:44.280]  which causes a burning sensation.
[3:15:44.280 --> 3:15:47.880]  It's converted to carbon dioxide and exhaled.
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:49.720]  But what happens if the carbon dioxide is trapped
[3:15:49.720 --> 3:15:50.560]  by the mask?
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:52.480]  Well, of course, you breathe it back in.
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:54.600]  There's also less oxygen in the air.
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:15:58.200]  This, of course, is why you don't wear a face mask
[3:15:58.200 --> 3:15:59.920]  while you're doing vigorous exercise.
[3:15:59.920 --> 3:16:03.040]  It can cause severe respiratory difficulties,
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:04.240]  breathing problems,
[3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:06.440]  and we've had cases where people,
[3:16:06.440 --> 3:16:09.000]  children have literally died
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:12.160]  because their parents have forced them to wear face masks
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:14.960]  during intense physical exercise.
[3:16:16.160 --> 3:16:18.000]  There's a need for understanding this is growing,
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.680]  given the story reported on Australian news
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:23.000]  that two teenage boys in China
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:24.400]  dying within a week of each other
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:27.560]  during compulsory physical education examinations
[3:16:27.560 --> 3:16:30.160]  while wearing face masks.
[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:34.000]  So you literally have people to prove that they're good people
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  and you can see in the look in their eyes
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:37.920]  when you walk anywhere near them,
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:40.560]  they wanna express their dominance,
[3:16:40.560 --> 3:16:42.960]  their morally righteous dominance over you
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:45.760]  because they're wearing a mask and you're not.
[3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:50.040]  I've seen not just people wearing masks outside in the UK
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:52.680]  which isn't a law and has never been a law,
[3:16:52.680 --> 3:16:54.600]  has never been part of the COVID rules,
[3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:57.640]  but again, they're doing it to prove they're good people,
[3:16:57.640 --> 3:16:59.640]  now more and more are wearing them
[3:16:59.640 --> 3:17:02.240]  while they're literally sprinting,
[3:17:03.120 --> 3:17:06.280]  risking literal breathing difficulties,
[3:17:06.280 --> 3:17:09.240]  risking collapse, risking actual death.
[3:17:09.240 --> 3:17:11.280]  And even though the World Health Organization
[3:17:11.280 --> 3:17:14.760]  has come out and said, don't do that,
[3:17:14.760 --> 3:17:16.920]  I'm seeing it in increasing numbers.
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:20.020]  I'm seeing people freaking out, jumping out of the way,
[3:17:20.020 --> 3:17:21.640]  not knowing how to behave
[3:17:21.640 --> 3:17:24.160]  because of this mass mental hysteria
[3:17:24.160 --> 3:17:26.800]  that's being pushed by the mainstream media
[3:17:26.800 --> 3:17:29.000]  and only continues to intensify.
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:31.720]  We're gonna get into Germany putting COVID dissidents
[3:17:31.720 --> 3:17:33.680]  in camps after break.
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:35.240]  Right, like Summit.News, now go away.
[3:17:35.240 --> 3:17:36.720]  We told you it was coming.
[3:17:36.720 --> 3:17:39.600]  Under the United Nations pilot program in Singapore
[3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:42.600]  for eight months, they made citizens wear bracelets
[3:17:42.600 --> 3:17:44.960]  on their arms that makes them a social distance
[3:17:44.960 --> 3:17:46.880]  and report them back to cell towers
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:47.960]  to track for every movement.
[3:17:47.960 --> 3:17:50.560]  This is for everybody, the way it gets better.
[3:17:50.560 --> 3:17:53.360]  Now France has programs in their factories,
[3:17:53.360 --> 3:17:54.920]  government, push, and sponsor
[3:17:54.920 --> 3:17:57.440]  to make everyone wear actual dog collars
[3:17:57.440 --> 3:17:59.280]  so they can make a social distance
[3:17:59.280 --> 3:18:01.120]  and report back to single computers.
[3:18:01.120 --> 3:18:03.360]  They're turning us into a commodity.
[3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:05.800]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years.
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:07.000]  It's all being announced.
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:09.840]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans
[3:18:09.840 --> 3:18:11.440]  and making us obsolete.
[3:18:11.440 --> 3:18:12.680]  And big corporations down the planet,
[3:18:12.680 --> 3:18:15.240]  they own us with these gene therapy systems
[3:18:15.240 --> 3:18:17.000]  and patents that they produced.
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  Do you understand?
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:21.520]  It is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level
[3:18:21.520 --> 3:18:23.560]  and now they're coming with dog collars
[3:18:23.560 --> 3:18:25.800]  and they're announcing in public schools in the U.S.
[3:18:25.800 --> 3:18:27.680]  starting next year, it will begin.
[3:18:27.680 --> 3:18:28.520]  Did you hear me?
[3:18:28.520 --> 3:18:30.200]  Dog collars for your children,
[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:32.560]  all based on a hoax, all based on a lie.
[3:18:32.560 --> 3:18:35.400]  Implem Wars will continue to spread the word to fight back.

[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:38.040]  The post-industrial world.
[3:19:38.040 --> 3:19:40.840]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed onto
[3:19:40.840 --> 3:19:45.840]  with the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:49.600]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030,
[3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:51.800]  which is a post-industrial world.
[3:19:51.800 --> 3:19:53.880]  Plou Schwab with the Davos Group,
[3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:55.120]  Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada,
[3:19:55.120 --> 3:20:00.120]  they're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030.
[3:20:00.560 --> 3:20:03.520]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[3:20:03.520 --> 3:20:06.680]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[3:20:06.680 --> 3:20:09.280]  It is making the population more by design
[3:20:09.280 --> 3:20:12.120]  so we can be controlled with a medical
[3:20:12.120 --> 3:20:14.560]  technocracy over you and your family.
[3:20:14.560 --> 3:20:16.560]  They're destroying civilization,
[3:20:16.560 --> 3:20:20.240]  rebuilding in their dystopic image.
[3:20:20.240 --> 3:20:23.000]  We are fighting this at infowarstore.com

[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:30.360]  to research it and share it with others
[3:20:30.360 --> 3:20:31.320]  and join the fight.

[3:20:35.080 --> 3:20:38.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:47.080 --> 3:20:49.080]  Live from London, England,
[3:20:49.080 --> 3:20:54.080]  it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:20:56.080 --> 3:20:58.080]  Now we know that since 2015,
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:02.080]  there were a ton of refugee camps opened in Germany
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:05.080]  because Angela Merkel, in her infinite wisdom,
[3:21:05.080 --> 3:21:07.080]  decided to allow around two million people
[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:10.080]  from Middle Eastern countries and North African countries
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:14.080]  into Germany on the back of the migrant crisis,
[3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:17.080]  which was created by the Obama administration
[3:21:17.080 --> 3:21:18.080]  invading Libya.
[3:21:18.080 --> 3:21:20.080]  We're going to get another taste of that.
[3:21:20.080 --> 3:21:23.080]  Our outrageously successful foreign policy here
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:26.080]  over the next four years, again, can't wait for that.
[3:21:26.080 --> 3:21:29.080]  So, of course, they opened up these refugee camps.
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:32.080]  We had massive terror attacks.
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:34.080]  We had massive increases in violent crime,
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:36.080]  according to the German government's own numbers.
[3:21:36.080 --> 3:21:38.080]  Massive increases in sexual assault and rapes.
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:41.080]  Of course, the Cologne New Year's Eve incident,
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:44.080]  where a thousand women were molested or raped,
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:47.080]  predominantly by North African refugees
[3:21:47.080 --> 3:21:50.080]  brought into the country by Angela Merkel herself.
[3:21:50.080 --> 3:21:54.080]  Now, though, some of those refugee camps are being emptied out,
[3:21:54.080 --> 3:21:57.080]  some of those refugees migrants are going back
[3:21:57.080 --> 3:22:01.080]  to their home country, so they have little more room available.
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:04.080]  And what they've decided to do with this extra room
[3:22:04.080 --> 3:22:08.080]  is to put COVID-19 dissidents in those camps.
[3:22:08.080 --> 3:22:10.080]  Camps for dissidents in Germany.
[3:22:10.080 --> 3:22:12.080]  What could possibly go wrong?
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:16.080]  Germany set to detain COVID rule breakers in refugee camps.
[3:22:16.080 --> 3:22:19.080]  We first highlighted this story on Friday,
[3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:22.080]  citing reports that people who repeatedly flaunt the rules
[3:22:22.080 --> 3:22:25.080]  will be held in a detention camp in Dresden.
[3:22:25.080 --> 3:22:28.080]  Now, authorities in numerous different areas have outlined
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:31.080]  where they will incarcerate those who break lockdown laws
[3:22:31.080 --> 3:22:34.080]  or refuse to self-isolate after catching COVID.
[3:22:34.080 --> 3:22:37.080]  And they basically said that in Saxony
[3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:41.080]  and in another area of the country, Brandenburg,
[3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:43.080]  they're going to use sections of refugee camps
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:48.080]  that are now unused or areas tagged onto those refugee camps
[3:22:48.080 --> 3:22:51.080]  to house people who don't pay fines
[3:22:51.080 --> 3:22:55.080]  when they get caught breaking lockdown laws.
[3:22:55.080 --> 3:22:59.080]  And this, of course, is probably going to enlist the support
[3:22:59.080 --> 3:23:01.080]  of the public, given the polls that we've seen
[3:23:01.080 --> 3:23:04.080]  over recent weeks and months.
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:07.080]  So COVID dissidents who violate social distancing,
[3:23:07.080 --> 3:23:10.080]  lockdown laws, mask laws are now literally being put in camps
[3:23:10.080 --> 3:23:12.080]  in Germany.
[3:23:12.080 --> 3:23:14.080]  Move along, nothing to see here.
[3:23:14.080 --> 3:23:18.080]  Meanwhile, people in Britain who have proven
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:23.080]  the most vehemently, zealotly, enthusiastic
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:25.080]  about supporting lockdown measures,
[3:23:25.080 --> 3:23:27.080]  no matter how draconian they become,
[3:23:27.080 --> 3:23:30.080]  now support the government having the power
[3:23:30.080 --> 3:23:33.080]  to literally spy on people's physical movements
[3:23:33.080 --> 3:23:38.080]  in live time via their cell phones to enforce lockdown.
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:42.080]  Poll plurality of Britain's support government
[3:23:42.080 --> 3:23:47.080]  spying on people via cell phone tracking to enforce lockdown.
[3:23:47.080 --> 3:23:49.080]  People in Britain support giving the government
[3:23:49.080 --> 3:23:51.080]  powers to spy on people's movements
[3:23:51.080 --> 3:23:54.080]  via cell phone tracking to enforce lockdown.
[3:23:54.080 --> 3:23:57.080]  That's 45% in support of the measure
[3:23:57.080 --> 3:24:01.080]  compared to 42% who oppose it.
[3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:03.080]  They ask numerous different people in different countries
[3:24:03.080 --> 3:24:05.080]  if they support a quote,
[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:08.080]  the government using the mobile phone data of individuals
[3:24:08.080 --> 3:24:10.080]  to ensure they're complying with restrictions
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:13.080]  on movement outside of the home during the lockdown.
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:15.080]  Now, in many of these countries,
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:19.080]  America included from what I saw in the survey,
[3:24:19.080 --> 3:24:21.080]  the majority opposed this measure,
[3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:24.080]  which of course is completely draconian,
[3:24:24.080 --> 3:24:27.080]  a surveillance nightmare that would make what
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:31.080]  Edward Snowden exposed look like a walk in the park,
[3:24:31.080 --> 3:24:33.080]  but in good old blighty,
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:35.080]  the majority of people, if you take out the ones
[3:24:35.080 --> 3:24:39.080]  who said don't know, support the measure.
[3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:42.080]  And as I write in the article, to put that into perspective,
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:44.080]  more people than not literally support
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:46.080]  providing the state the power to track people's
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:48.080]  physical movements in real time
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:51.080]  by giving them access to GPS triangulation data.
[3:24:51.080 --> 3:24:55.080]  In Australia, even more people supported it
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:24:59.080]  at a rate of 62% to 29%.
[3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:01.080]  When asked whether the government should
[3:25:01.080 --> 3:25:04.080]  literally ban handshakes,
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:07.080]  maybe even put people in camps if they
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:10.080]  shake the hand of somebody,
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:13.080]  76% respondents in the UK
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:16.080]  support the idea with just 13% in opposition.
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:19.080]  So over three-quarters of the British population
[3:25:19.080 --> 3:25:21.080]  want the government to literally have the power
[3:25:21.080 --> 3:25:24.080]  to find people, and then if they don't find them,
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:28.080]  put them in prison for shaking someone's hand.
[3:25:28.080 --> 3:25:30.080]  Totally normal.
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:32.080]  Ugov apologists have routinely found that
[3:25:32.080 --> 3:25:34.080]  large majority of the UK population
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:38.080]  support increasingly draconian lockdown measures.
[3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:40.080]  Despite all the peer-reviewed studies
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:42.080]  that I just went through at the top of the show,
[3:25:42.080 --> 3:25:45.080]  proving that they don't work,
[3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:48.080]  but you won't find those stories, those peer-reviewed studies.
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:51.080]  You won't find any coverage of them on BBC News or Sky News,
[3:25:51.080 --> 3:25:56.080]  which is why people continue to be hysterically brainwashed.
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:25:59.080]  Meanwhile, UK authorities could force people
[3:25:59.080 --> 3:26:04.080]  to take selfie every day to prove they're self-isolating.
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:07.080]  And of course, this is off the back of this narrative,
[3:26:07.080 --> 3:26:09.080]  which they're now introducing,
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:13.080]  where they're going to say, we've had the third lockdown.
[3:26:13.080 --> 3:26:17.080]  We need to extend it for a significantly longer amount of time,
[3:26:17.080 --> 3:26:20.080]  either because we haven't got enough vaccines out to people,
[3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:24.080]  because too many people have refused to take the vaccine,
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:27.080]  or because people are ignoring the lockdown laws.
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:30.080]  So they're going to get more viciously draconian
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:33.080]  in enforcing them, and we've seen that already.
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:36.080]  People literally being arrested for drinking a cup of coffee
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:40.080]  on a bench, a couple of women who went for a walk
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:42.080]  in a remote, rural location,
[3:26:42.080 --> 3:26:45.080]  being intercepted, interrogated, fined by police.
[3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:48.080]  More examples of that coming out on a daily basis.
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:51.080]  Well, now UK authorities are considering a new measure
[3:26:51.080 --> 3:26:54.080]  that would force people to send selfies every day
[3:26:54.080 --> 3:26:56.080]  to prove they're self-isolating photos,
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:27:00.080]  which would then be cross-referenced using GPS data
[3:27:00.080 --> 3:27:03.080]  and facial recognition software.
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:07.080]  Now, they're talking about mimicking the New Zealand model,
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:09.080]  where all new arrivals to the country
[3:27:09.080 --> 3:27:11.080]  are forced to check into a quarantine hotel
[3:27:11.080 --> 3:27:13.080]  at the airport for a period of two weeks.
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:14.080]  Now, they should have shut down.
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:18.080]  They were really treating this as seriously as they told us,
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:20.080]  as seriously as they claimed it was at the start.
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:23.080]  They should have shut down the borders right at the start,
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:25.080]  as many other countries did,
[3:27:25.080 --> 3:27:28.080]  and went on to have lower infection rates, lower death rates.
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:31.080]  But no, the borders have been wide open
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:34.080]  for the entire 10 months for people coming in,
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:37.080]  people coming from Brazil, South Africa.
[3:27:37.080 --> 3:27:39.080]  They were only stopped a couple of weeks ago,
[3:27:39.080 --> 3:27:42.080]  despite these mutant strains arriving from those countries.
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:45.080]  Meanwhile, it's literally illegal for me
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:47.080]  to drive 30 minutes from where I live
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:50.080]  to visit somebody on the south coast of the country.
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:53.080]  But everyone and their dogs and their relatives
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:56.080]  and anything whatsoever can come into the country,
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:00.080]  but we've got internal borders and we can't get out.
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:03.080]  So they're mirroring what New Zealand's done,
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:06.080]  and now they're literally suggesting this policy
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:09.080]  where, quote, each person is contacted once a day
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:12.080]  and told to send a photograph of themselves at the location
[3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:14.080]  where they are confined.
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:16.080]  These are cross-referenced using GPS data
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:18.080]  and facial recognition software.
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:20.080]  Those who fail to comply within 20 minutes
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:23.080]  receive a visit from the police.
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:26.080]  We've already seen those home visits being carried out,
[3:28:26.080 --> 3:28:28.080]  for example, in Scotland,
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:31.080]  where a family was visited and arrested
[3:28:31.080 --> 3:28:33.080]  because their neighbors snitched on them
[3:28:33.080 --> 3:28:35.080]  for violating lockdown rules.
[3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:38.080]  So now they're literally talking about forcing people
[3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:41.080]  to send pictures of themselves to the government
[3:28:41.080 --> 3:28:45.080]  to prove they're staying at home, staying safe.
[3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:49.080]  Again, nothing killingly Orwellian draconian
[3:28:49.080 --> 3:28:51.080]  about that whatsoever.
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:53.080]  But again, if you've seen the polls,
[3:28:53.080 --> 3:28:55.080]  the vast majority of people apparently support it.
[3:28:55.080 --> 3:28:57.080]  I don't see that in the street.
[3:28:57.080 --> 3:28:59.080]  I don't hear it when I talk to people.
[3:28:59.080 --> 3:29:02.080]  When we were allowed to talk to people about a month ago,
[3:29:02.080 --> 3:29:04.080]  I only saw the opposite.
[3:29:04.080 --> 3:29:06.080]  I only experienced the opposite where literally
[3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:09.080]  everyone was bitching and moaning about this lockdown.
[3:29:09.080 --> 3:29:11.080]  But apparently, according to these polls,
[3:29:11.080 --> 3:29:13.080]  I don't know who they're sampling.
[3:29:13.080 --> 3:29:18.080]  Like, BBC addicted television viewers in their 80s maybe
[3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:21.080]  is their main sample for these polls.
[3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:24.080]  But we continue to see massive overwhelming support
[3:29:24.080 --> 3:29:27.080]  for the most draconian measures.
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:30.080]  Speaking of which, in Bali, Indonesia,
[3:29:30.080 --> 3:29:33.080]  police force tourists caught not wearing masks
[3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:35.080]  to do push-ups.
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:38.080]  Police in Bali are forcing tourists caught not wearing face masks
[3:29:38.080 --> 3:29:41.080]  to do push-ups and sweep the streets as punishment.
[3:29:41.080 --> 3:29:44.080]  Maybe that's going to be brought in over here.
[3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:47.080]  I don't want to give them any ideas, do we?
[3:29:47.080 --> 3:29:50.080]  So basically, if you don't pay the fine,
[3:29:50.080 --> 3:29:54.080]  the police, which I imagine in Indonesia,
[3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:56.080]  aren't too patient,
[3:29:56.080 --> 3:30:01.080]  force people to get down on their knees and do 25 push-ups,
[3:30:01.080 --> 3:30:04.080]  or if they can't do that, sweep the streets.
[3:30:04.080 --> 3:30:07.080]  Now, thankfully, this appears to be being treated
[3:30:07.080 --> 3:30:11.080]  with what it deserves, which is basically complete dismissal
[3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:13.080]  by tourists, by foreigners in Bali.
[3:30:13.080 --> 3:30:15.080]  And if you look at the pictures, they're literally laughing.
[3:30:15.080 --> 3:30:18.080]  But in doing so, they're still performing the push-ups.
[3:30:18.080 --> 3:30:22.080]  There's basically a big scandal about this.
[3:30:22.080 --> 3:30:26.080]  They're blaming Russians for not following the face mask rules
[3:30:26.080 --> 3:30:30.080]  and forcing all tourists who descend against that
[3:30:30.080 --> 3:30:33.080]  to do physical exercise while the security officers watch.
[3:30:33.080 --> 3:30:59.080]  Don't go away.
[3:30:59.080 --> 3:31:03.080]  This mouthwash only uses the best natural ingredients
[3:31:03.080 --> 3:31:07.080]  like real peppermint oil, thymol, xylitol,
[3:31:07.080 --> 3:31:10.080]  and of course, high-quality charcoal.
[3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:14.080]  Not only fluoride-free, this mouthwash is completely free
[3:31:14.080 --> 3:31:19.080]  of other dangerous ingredients such as SLS, harsh detergents,
[3:31:19.080 --> 3:31:21.080]  BPA, and so much more.
[3:31:21.080 --> 3:31:25.080]  As soon as you use it, you can tell that this formula is the real deal.
[3:31:25.080 --> 3:31:29.080]  So get your bottle of the new activated charcoal mouthwash
[3:31:29.080 --> 3:31:58.080]  right now at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:00.080 --> 3:32:03.080]  This is economic domination. This is economic war.
[3:32:03.080 --> 3:32:05.080]  We are being consolidated. We are being taken over.
[3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:08.080]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[3:32:08.080 --> 3:32:12.080]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population
[3:32:12.080 --> 3:32:14.080]  and bring them absolutely to heel
[3:32:14.080 --> 3:32:18.080]  and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[3:32:18.080 --> 3:32:20.080]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:22.080]  That's what the great reset is.
[3:32:22.080 --> 3:32:24.080]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:26.080]  That's what social distancing is.
[3:32:26.080 --> 3:32:29.080]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[3:32:29.080 --> 3:32:32.080]  No small businesses will be there.
[3:32:32.080 --> 3:32:34.080]  This is a master plan. Say no.
[3:32:38.080 --> 3:32:40.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history.
[3:32:40.080 --> 3:32:42.080]  I've interviewed all the experts.
[3:32:42.080 --> 3:32:44.080]  I have looked at every facet of this.
[3:32:44.080 --> 3:32:48.080]  And now, only days until the inauguration of the CHICOM agent,
[3:32:48.080 --> 3:32:50.080]  it's all coming into place.
[3:32:50.080 --> 3:32:52.080]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud.
[3:32:52.080 --> 3:32:54.080]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop.
[3:32:54.080 --> 3:32:58.080]  It's how they change the subject from Epstein and Obama
[3:32:58.080 --> 3:33:00.080]  and Al Qaeda and the New World Order.
[3:33:00.080 --> 3:33:04.080]  And now, use the already martial law in place for COVID-19.
[3:33:04.080 --> 3:33:08.080]  And that's what it is, to then be expanded and become political
[3:33:08.080 --> 3:33:10.080]  and become permanent.
[3:33:10.080 --> 3:33:12.080]  They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked.
[3:33:12.080 --> 3:33:15.080]  They train you to do what you're told for nine, ten months as training wheels.
[3:33:15.080 --> 3:33:17.080]  And now they launch the storm.
[3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:19.080]  The storm is here.
[3:33:19.080 --> 3:33:21.080]  It's a globalist storm.
[3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:23.080]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump.
[3:33:23.080 --> 3:33:25.080]  There's going to be martial law for the globalist.
[3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:27.080]  They're trying to set you up.
[3:33:27.080 --> 3:33:29.080]  Don't be involved in violence.
[3:33:29.080 --> 3:33:32.080]  Expose the New World Order and expose the takeover with information.
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:34:01.080]  That's how we beat these people with truth.
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:09.080]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[3:34:09.080 --> 3:34:13.080]  So the new URL that links right to Bandot Video and all of our videos

[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:40.080]  The resistance.video.
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:47.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:34:47.080 --> 3:34:54.080]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:57.760]  How you like me now? How you like me now?
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:34:59.840]  Well, Michael Tracy is tweeting this.
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:03.600]  Media members who once denounced the deployment of military force to American
[3:35:03.600 --> 3:35:07.680]  treaties as the bravest incarnation of violent fascism
[3:35:07.680 --> 3:35:10.800]  now join together to cheer the military occupation of
[3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:15.920]  Washington DC. That's precisely what's been happening over the past few days.
[3:35:15.920 --> 3:35:19.840]  But Trump has come out with a statement here in the past hour or so
[3:35:19.840 --> 3:35:24.000]  on the eve of Joe Biden's inauguration tomorrow.
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:28.560]  It's a tweet from Catherine Folders. It says an excerpt from President Trump's
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:31.520]  farewell video address which is scheduled to be released soon.
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:34.000]  Don't know where it's going to be released because he's literally banned
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:38.640]  from basically every social media platform. It says quote now as I prepare to
[3:35:38.640 --> 3:35:41.920]  hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday
[3:35:41.920 --> 3:35:45.200]  I want you to know that the movement we started
[3:35:45.200 --> 3:35:50.320]  is only just beginning signaling of course that Trump is not going to go
[3:35:50.320 --> 3:35:53.680]  quietly into the night much to the chagrin of
[3:35:53.680 --> 3:35:56.800]  leftists or perhaps some of them will actually enjoy the fact that he's going
[3:35:56.800 --> 3:36:02.080]  to hang around so they can continue their hysterical mob campaign against him.
[3:36:02.080 --> 3:36:05.920]  Basically the only thing that fuels their hatred at this point.
[3:36:05.920 --> 3:36:10.080]  But to others this is of even bigger concern and they're now literally
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:15.120]  claiming that Trump is going to lead an army of domestic terrorists
[3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:18.800]  to put America into a state of civil war. These are blue check marks on Twitter.
[3:36:18.800 --> 3:36:23.440]  These are supposedly credible people. We have this headline out of
[3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:26.720]  summit news and we got the video which we're going to play here in a second.
[3:36:26.720 --> 3:36:31.120]  Author says Trump will lead army of terrorists encourages Biden voters to
[3:36:31.120 --> 3:36:35.360]  spy on them. A viral video posted to Twitter by a
[3:36:35.360 --> 3:36:39.840]  best-selling author says Trump plans to lead an army of domestic terrorists
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:42.960]  and encourages Joe Biden voters to spy on their activity
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:46.960]  and report them to authorities. Now this is no
[3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:51.360]  small rinky dink video last time I checked. I write in the article in fact it
[3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:56.160]  has received over 37,000 likes. It's now got over 41,000 likes.
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:37:02.480]  It's received well over three million views calling all Trump supporters
[3:37:02.480 --> 3:37:05.040]  terrorists saying that we should basically set up a new
[3:37:05.040 --> 3:37:08.800]  East German style Starzy to spy on them report them to the authorities
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:14.240]  because what could be more American than that? Here's the clip let's roll it.
[3:37:14.240 --> 3:37:18.560]  Honored before January 20th Donald Trump will no longer be the commander-in-chief.
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:22.560]  He will lose control of the army, navy, air force, marines, special forces,
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:26.960]  and America's nuclear arsenal. On January 20th Donald Trump will become the
[3:37:26.960 --> 3:37:33.600]  commander-in-chief of a different army. This army.
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:36.560]  The greatest threat facing America today comes from within.
[3:37:36.560 --> 3:37:40.560]  Radical extreme conservatives also known as domestic terrorists.
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:43.680]  They are hidden among us disguised behind regular jobs.
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:47.040]  They are your children's teachers. They work at supermarkets, malls,
[3:37:47.040 --> 3:37:50.640]  doctor's offices, and many are police officers and soldiers.
[3:37:50.640 --> 3:37:54.240]  For more than a decade Donald Trump has spoken directly to white supremacists
[3:37:54.240 --> 3:37:59.920]  in their language. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.
[3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:06.800]  Pocahontas. Is it offensive? Oh, I'm sorry about that. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:11.840]  complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. In the middle of a
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:15.360]  presidential debate Donald Trump was asked to disavow white supremacy.
[3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:19.520]  He refused. Instead he told the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by.
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:24.560]  Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. They heard their leader. They even responded
[3:38:24.560 --> 3:38:29.040]  to him on Twitter promising to stand by. And on January 6th 2021
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:32.720]  Trump Green lit them. They suited up. They flew in. They took hotel rooms.
[3:38:32.720 --> 3:38:35.760]  They loaded their weapons, prepared their bombs, and they attacked with the
[3:38:35.760 --> 3:38:39.040]  intention of killing Nancy Pelosi and hanging Vice President Mike Pence.
[3:38:45.040 --> 3:38:48.240]  They were vocally saying where's the speaker? We know she has staff.
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:50.160]  They're here someplace. We're going to find them.
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:55.680]  In the years ahead Trump will lead his army of domestic terrorists.
[3:38:55.680 --> 3:38:59.440]  He will encourage and incite violence. He will play the role of arsonist and
[3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:02.720]  fireman. He will start a civil war and then say things were more peaceful when
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:06.160]  he was president. We have to fight back. In this new war the
[3:39:06.160 --> 3:39:10.240]  battlefield has changes. Computers can be more valuable than guns.
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:13.920]  And this is what we need now more than ever. An army of citizen detectives
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:17.760]  and proposing we form a citizen army. Our weapons will be computers and cell
[3:39:17.760 --> 3:39:20.480]  phones. We who are monitoring extremists on the
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:22.880]  internet and reporting their findings to authorities.
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:26.960]  Remember before the Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden, he had to be found.
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:30.720]  He was found by a CIA analyst working on a computer thousands of miles away.
[3:39:31.520 --> 3:39:32.640]  It's up to you.
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:39.200]  Now of course we've condemned the violence at the Capitol Building.
[3:39:39.200 --> 3:39:43.280]  The kind of people behind this video have not only failed to condemn,
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:49.760]  but also they have incited, supported, advocated the actual domestic violent
[3:39:49.760 --> 3:39:53.280]  extremists that for the past seven months throughout American cities
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:39:58.240]  have caused $2 billion worth of property damage and whose riots led directly
[3:39:58.240 --> 3:40:04.320]  to the deaths of at least 25 people whose hateful rhetoric led directly
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:07.680]  to the execution on the streets of Portland of that Trump supporter
[3:40:08.320 --> 3:40:15.200]  and several others. Notice he's literally comparing 70 million Trump supporters,
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:20.160]  the vast, vast majority of whom had nothing whatsoever to do with what happened
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:25.440]  at the Capitol Building, to literal terrorist masterminds like Osama bin
[3:40:25.440 --> 3:40:31.040]  Laden. This is again going back to this demented comparison that they wheeled out.
[3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:36.080]  That this unfortunate tragic violence at the Capitol Building which we condemn
[3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:42.160]  that led to the death of five people is in anyhow comparable to Pearl Harbor.
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:45.280]  Remember Chuck Schumer came out and compared it to Pearl Harbor,
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:49.920]  or in this case Osama bin Laden in 9-11 now that is completely demented.
[3:40:50.560 --> 3:40:54.880]  This video is probably going to go nowhere more than a lopping exercise.
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:41:01.520]  I mean if they're really going to officially set up an organization which is primarily almost
[3:41:01.520 --> 3:41:08.400]  exclusively purposed around setting up a literal East German style Starzy to report on Trump supporters,
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:12.480]  well they're going to be very busy given that there are literally what 70 million of them.
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:18.640]  But now Trump has come out and said that his movement will continue so the hysteria,
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:24.960]  the condemnation, the moral panic will continue with it. Now of course the argument that's been
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:31.600]  made in the aftermath of the Capitol Building siege is that this means it's more important than ever
[3:41:31.600 --> 3:41:35.840]  to have mass censorship because of course that's what the good guys do isn't it,
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:41.280]  is silencing people's right to free speech on a massive scale. That's what the good guys do.
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:46.480]  Well actually that makes it harder to fight terrorism and those are not my words.
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:52.960]  Those are the words of a former FBI profiler who says banning people on social media makes it
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:59.680]  harder to fight terrorism and this was included as part of an NBC news article. A former FBI
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:04.880]  profiler told NBC News that banning people on social media makes it harder to fight terrorism
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:10.720]  because it stops authorities from being able to keep track of their activity and he cites the case
[3:42:10.720 --> 3:42:18.240]  or the article cites the case of this 70 year old individual called Lonnie Kaufman who was involved
[3:42:18.240 --> 3:42:23.120]  in the Capitol Building incident. I don't think he actually went into the building but he brought
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:29.600]  weapons, improvised grenades and a assault rifle I believe to the protest itself.
[3:42:29.600 --> 3:42:34.320]  The problem is authorities had no indication of his involvement or what was coming or what
[3:42:34.320 --> 3:42:40.800]  he planned. Thankfully he was detained before he was able to do anything but they had no indication,
[3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:47.280]  no warning because the guy was not on any social media. He had no extremist ties.
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:54.000]  Nobody knew who he was even in his hometown. He had no criminal record but this is what
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:43:00.160]  this FBI profiler said to NBC News. He said we know there are going to be guys out there that are not
[3:43:00.160 --> 3:43:04.880]  happy over the next four years with the Biden administration. The authorities really have
[3:43:04.880 --> 3:43:10.320]  got their work cut out for them to identify Ted Kaczynski type individuals who are sitting out
[3:43:10.320 --> 3:43:16.240]  there planning to make a difference in the world. And as the article notes, the purging of people
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:21.280]  with radical views from popular social platforms which has escalated in recent weeks, the
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:26.640]  pribes investigators of a crucial tool in tracking people who might move along the continuum of
[3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:33.680]  ideation to action. And of course let's not forget that the vast majority of planning by these
[3:43:33.680 --> 3:43:39.920]  extremists didn't happen on parlor, didn't happen on gab, didn't happen on telegram, it happened
[3:43:39.920 --> 3:43:45.360]  on Facebook and Twitter yet. Last time I checked they're still on the app store and no one is
[3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:52.240]  calling for them to be deleted. Of course numerous mass shootings, murders, also live streamed on
[3:43:52.240 --> 3:43:56.320]  Facebook and Twitter in the past. They're not responsible for that but apparently parlor and
[3:43:56.320 --> 3:44:01.200]  gab and whoever else builds an independent platform that isn't controlled by the global oligarchy,
[3:44:01.200 --> 3:44:05.840]  they're responsible for what their users say. Interesting that, isn't it, how they rigged that system.
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:12.240]  Laura Luma has been banned from owning a firearm. She claims on her website today I've been banned
[3:44:12.240 --> 3:44:17.200]  from owning a firearm, a warning of what's to come for all conservative Americans. This was
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:23.760]  apparently in response to her confronting somebody in a media stunt which had actually I think
[3:44:23.760 --> 3:44:30.000]  predated or may have happened around the same time that she was banned by PayPal, GoFundMe,
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:36.160]  Twitter, all these other networks and platforms and services. So now because of her journalism
[3:44:36.160 --> 3:44:42.240]  and because of her political activism, she's being put on a federal national instant criminal
[3:44:42.240 --> 3:44:48.560]  background check system list and prohibited, as she says, from ever owning or touching a firearm.
[3:44:48.560 --> 3:44:54.400]  So again, it's this social credit score system. It's not just the social media networks. It's
[3:44:54.400 --> 3:45:00.960]  your bank account. It's your insurance policy. It's your right to exercise your second amendment.
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:07.040]  Eventually, you're right to any kind of interstate commerce whatsoever. They want you out on the
[3:45:07.040 --> 3:45:12.480]  street. They want you out on a park bench and maybe even that's not going to be enough. They're
[3:45:12.480 --> 3:45:16.400]  going for the whole thing. I was going to wrap it up for Summit.News. Coming up next,
[3:45:16.400 --> 3:45:31.760]  War Room with Owen Shroyer. Keep it right here. Don't go away.
