[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  Well, President Trump has taken his fight against the New World Order to maximum.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  And he has gone all the way and told the people the truth.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  His rhetoric is not exaggerated. It's not understated.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  It's dead on, sweet spot, like that hole in one we saw this weekend.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  It's incredible.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  And only the real truth about where our country is and the position it's in will reverse the incredible slide into abject tyranny and collapse.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  President Trump has come out. I mean, I've got like his hour-long speech.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  We're to play some of the clips.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  And said that we live under a globalist dictatorship.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  They are fascist using communist tactics, but they're fascist. That's what they are. Properly define them.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  And that they are cementing a permanent tyranny and dictatorship over America.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  And that this is the final battle.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  Now, he's been saying final battle for a couple of weeks, which there'll be more battles ahead if they kill Trump.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  And there'll be more struggles. And we'll defeat the globalists in the end.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  But this really is the first great battle with the New World Order occupational government out in the open.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  Stealing elections, spying, censoring, turning the security agencies publicly loose on the people.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  I mean, this could be the final battle if he gets reelected and gets control of the Justice Department, starts prosecuting these people, which he's pledged to do.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  So it could be the final battle because we could defeat them, or they could bring in a permanent dictatorship that we never remove.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  But the statements about this being an occupied dictatorship of the globalists, of these fascists, is dead on.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  You know, Trump says globalists is too nice a term for him, that they're really fascist communist criminals.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  And the average leftist intellectual goes, oh my gosh, communists and fascists are totally different.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  No, they're not. They're very similar.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  From the surveillance, to the secret police, the black uniforms, to the centralized government.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  Just with fascism, they allow big corporations to still operate and merge with the state.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  And that's what we've got going on.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]  So the New World Order is fascist.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  It's a high-tech, neo-feudalistic, mad scientist program of transhumanism that uses communist rhetoric at the grassroots level.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]  Just like they use China as a communist system for the average person, but not for their billionaire generals.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  And Obama's gone around and given speeches explaining to law students in Africa and Central America and Latin America and all over.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  We've played the speeches many times where he's like, now listen, we need a hybrid system of communism and capitalism.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  And that's the system that we're building in the New World Order.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  Yeah, it's called slavery with a high-tech name.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]  So all of these clips with Trump are coming up.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  And then, boy, you talk about leadership in the European Union Parliament, which is ceremonial.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  The original EU is an unelected corporate bureaucracy that is absorbing all the nation states and even getting rid of any form of sovereignty and killing single-state veto power.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  But more and more, the parliament is standing up and becoming a major leadership beacon in the bully pulpit, a spotlight for the national parliaments, which are throwing out the globalists all across Europe.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  Major gains by the patriot right-wing groups in Germany.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  Major gains in the Netherlands.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  Major gains in Sweden.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  Major gains in Italy.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  Major gains in the UK.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  Major gains, major gains, major gains in France and so forth.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]  And now we've got just amazing clips that we'll play when we come back with folks taking it to the globalists.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  The fight is on.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  European citizens initiate operation against the WHO.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  Power grab.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  Say the U.N. is a criminal organization taking control through the bio-attack they launched, COVID-19.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  This is being said in the parliament in major coalitions forming that are winning from Hungary to France.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  The worm is turning.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]  People don't want to own nothing and have nothing.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  They're not going to be happy.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  Big, big, big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  So start your engines.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  Take the links.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  Infowars.com.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  Newswars.com.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  Bandai Video.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]  Take clips.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  Share them.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  Share the articles.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  You're the Paul Ramirez.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  Without you, we lose.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  When you take action, we win.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  So come in for the big win now.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  Connect to share the links now.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  This is something you need now.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air filtration.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:11.527]  From the frontlines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.527 --> 00:06:28.527]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday, July 17, 20.
[00:06:29.527 --> 00:06:31.527]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:31.527 --> 00:06:34.527]  And wow, the New World Order is out in the open.
[00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:40.527]  It's gone operational against humanity with its depopulation, societal, civilizational collapse operation.
[00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:46.527]  And it's getting blown to pieces in front of everybody.
[00:06:46.527 --> 00:06:54.527]  The only question is, will this giant squid be able to drag us into hell with it?
[00:06:54.527 --> 00:06:57.527]  Trump has gone over the top.
[00:06:57.527 --> 00:07:02.527]  We're going to cover that first at a Turning Point USA extravaganza.
[00:07:02.527 --> 00:07:05.527]  And just said we're under a fascist dictatorship.
[00:07:05.527 --> 00:07:07.527]  They've occupied the government.
[00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:10.527]  They're going to bring in a permanent dictatorship, but we don't stop them.
[00:07:10.527 --> 00:07:12.527]  This is the most important election ever.
[00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:15.527]  People always say that, but this time it is true in spades.
[00:07:15.527 --> 00:07:17.527]  You know it.
[00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:19.527]  And just said the truth.
[00:07:19.527 --> 00:07:26.527]  And now that Trump is super hardcore, he's 70 plus points ahead in all the polls.
[00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:28.527]  Against all other candidates combined.
[00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:30.527]  That's Republicans.
[00:07:30.527 --> 00:07:33.527]  He's 30 to 40 points ahead of Biden.
[00:07:33.527 --> 00:07:36.527]  Even in skewed CNN polls, he's 20 points ahead.
[00:07:36.527 --> 00:07:39.527]  This has never been seen since polling began.
[00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:42.527]  Trump is wildly popular now.
[00:07:42.527 --> 00:07:49.527]  Except for small leftist enclaves in collapsing San Francisco and New York City.
[00:07:49.527 --> 00:07:55.527]  And again, delusional drug addicts and trust fund people that live in high rises.
[00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:58.527]  And I'm not against people that live in high rises, but that's where they live.
[00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:01.527]  And they just are not living in the real world.
[00:08:01.527 --> 00:08:05.527]  And they're plugged into Netflix and into BuzzFeed and into Instagram.
[00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:10.527]  And they really think that eating bugs is good and that pedophilia is good.
[00:08:10.527 --> 00:08:16.527]  And that convicted pedophiles at gay pride parades shaking their ding-a-lings in five-year-old's faces is good.
[00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:18.527]  They really think World War III is good.
[00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:20.527]  They think nuclear weapons are good.
[00:08:20.527 --> 00:08:22.527]  They think nuclear war is good.
[00:08:22.527 --> 00:08:25.527]  Sean Penn says he wants nuclear war. Let's just have it.
[00:08:25.527 --> 00:08:28.527]  And I'm sarcastic and said, yeah, let's just blow the planet up.
[00:08:28.527 --> 00:08:29.527]  Oh, look, Jones wants to blow it up.
[00:08:29.527 --> 00:08:31.527]  No, I'm trying to stop us blowing it up.
[00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:34.527]  You're the ones trying to blow it up.
[00:08:34.527 --> 00:08:36.527]  So we've got all of that with Trump.
[00:08:36.527 --> 00:08:40.527]  R.F.K. Jr. coming out and saying, we're not going to take your guns.
[00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:42.527]  We need our guns to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government.
[00:08:42.527 --> 00:08:44.527]  The problem is the SSRIs.
[00:08:44.527 --> 00:08:46.527]  Wow, new statements.
[00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:49.527]  Climate change is being used to control us through fear.
[00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:51.527]  Not to deal with real environmental problems.
[00:08:51.527 --> 00:08:56.527]  The ESGs and the U.N. and their carbon taxes are for ultra-rich banks to shut down all their competition.
[00:08:56.527 --> 00:08:58.527]  I mean, yes, total truth.
[00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:06.527]  COVID-19 was a bioweapon that's designed to attack black people and white people and not Chinese or Ashkenazi Jews.
[00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:07.527]  That's actually in the studies.
[00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:09.527]  We'll be showing it to you.
[00:09:09.527 --> 00:09:10.527]  He's come out and said that.
[00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:13.527]  I mean, it just gets wilder and wilder as the truth comes out.
[00:09:13.527 --> 00:09:15.527]  Absolutely insane.
[00:09:16.527 --> 00:09:23.527]  Big developments on the ESG front tied into their real plan and what's in command of the operation.
[00:09:23.527 --> 00:09:27.527]  The SDGs, meant to get to that last night, did not get any of that.
[00:09:27.527 --> 00:09:32.527]  We've just got so much to cover here today.
[00:09:32.527 --> 00:09:34.527]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:09:34.527 --> 00:09:41.527]  And then really interesting lawyer and science buff and bestselling author Kent Heckenliebly
[00:09:41.527 --> 00:09:43.527]  to be joining us coming in studio.
[00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:45.527]  Third hour, Gerald Celente.
[00:09:45.527 --> 00:09:46.527]  Fourth hour.
[00:09:46.527 --> 00:09:49.527]  And I will open the phones up today as well.
[00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:57.527]  So, without further ado, the full Trump speeches on Infowars.com and a Steve Watson article.
[00:09:57.527 --> 00:09:59.527]  Please go watch it and share it.
[00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:10.527]  But here, because this truth needs to get boosted, is Trump on what's at stake if Democrats in 2024 are able to steal the election again.
[00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:11.527]  We'll play clip two.
[00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:17.527]  Then we'll play clip 15, where Trump gets even more hardcore.
[00:10:17.527 --> 00:10:20.527]  With you at my side, we will demolish the deep state.
[00:10:20.527 --> 00:10:22.527]  We will expel the warmongers from our government.
[00:10:22.527 --> 00:10:24.527]  We will drive out the globalists.
[00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:26.527]  We will cast out the communists, Marxists, fascists.
[00:10:26.527 --> 00:10:29.527]  And he said it correctly.
[00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:34.527]  It's Marxists on the, communist idiots on the bottom, Marxists above them, and then fascists running it offshore.
[00:10:34.527 --> 00:10:36.527]  And Obama's own book, he writes that.
[00:10:37.527 --> 00:10:38.527]  The average liberal doesn't get that.
[00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:40.527]  You're too stupid to read your master's own writings.
[00:10:40.527 --> 00:10:43.527]  And then we'll play, after that, going to break here.
[00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:45.527]  We'll play clip 14.
[00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:46.527]  Here they are, back to back.
[00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:48.527]  Future on the line.
[00:10:48.527 --> 00:10:49.527]  We are in trouble.
[00:10:49.527 --> 00:10:50.527]  This country is in trouble.
[00:10:50.527 --> 00:10:58.527]  The election will decide whether your generation inherits a fascist country or a free country.
[00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:02.527]  Whether you will have a rule of tyrants or the rule of law.
[00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:07.527]  Whether Marxist radicals burn our civilization to the ground, which they're looking to do.
[00:11:07.527 --> 00:11:13.527]  Or young patriots like you propel America to glorious new heights, greater than ever before.
[00:11:13.527 --> 00:11:17.527]  Side by side, we're going to fight and we're going to win.
[00:11:17.527 --> 00:11:19.527]  We have no choice, actually.
[00:11:24.527 --> 00:11:28.527]  We're going to evict crooked Joe Biden.
[00:11:28.527 --> 00:11:30.527]  You know, I took the name off of Hillary.
[00:11:30.527 --> 00:11:31.527]  You know that, right?
[00:11:31.527 --> 00:11:32.527]  Everybody here knows that.
[00:11:32.527 --> 00:11:33.527]  It was crooked Hillary.
[00:11:33.527 --> 00:11:35.527]  It was very successful.
[00:11:35.527 --> 00:11:38.527]  But I think she's out of it now.
[00:11:38.527 --> 00:11:43.527]  But no, I thought it was more appropriate because he's crooked.
[00:11:43.527 --> 00:11:47.527]  As you can get, this is the most dishonest president in history.
[00:11:47.527 --> 00:11:48.527]  And I wouldn't have said it.
[00:11:48.527 --> 00:11:52.527]  You know, I have I have pride in the presidency and respect for the presidency.
[00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:54.527]  I wouldn't have said it.
[00:11:54.527 --> 00:12:00.527]  But I say things about him over the last three weeks that I would have never said before about any president.
[00:12:00.527 --> 00:12:04.527]  He is a corrupt, horrible, incompetent man.
[00:12:04.527 --> 00:12:05.527]  And he's destroying our country.
[00:12:05.527 --> 00:12:07.527]  And we have to have it changed.
[00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:14.527]  With God's help, we're going to save America on November 5th, 2024.
[00:12:14.527 --> 00:12:21.527]  And when I said originally in 2016, it's the most important election, I meant that this is far more important.
[00:12:21.527 --> 00:12:28.527]  This is far more important because our country is ready to go down, ready to go possibly into World War III.
[00:12:28.527 --> 00:12:30.527]  And this won't be a war like others.
[00:12:30.527 --> 00:12:33.527]  This will be a nuclear war and the level of destruction.
[00:12:33.527 --> 00:12:35.527]  It's called obliteration.
[00:12:35.527 --> 00:12:39.527]  It's not two army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other.
[00:12:39.527 --> 00:12:40.527]  This is big stuff.
[00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:47.527]  And we have a man who's grossly incompetent, who doesn't even know where he is, who can't put two sentences together.
[00:12:47.527 --> 00:12:52.527]  And this is the man that's telling us what we're going to be doing under Biden.
[00:12:52.527 --> 00:12:54.527]  Hope and opportunity for young people.
[00:12:54.527 --> 00:13:01.527]  So many young people here are being utterly extinguished in the Biden economy.
[00:13:01.527 --> 00:13:07.527]  One third of Gen Z and millennials have no savings accounts and no saving whatsoever.
[00:13:07.527 --> 00:13:08.527]  They have nothing.
[00:13:08.527 --> 00:13:09.527]  They have nothing.
[00:13:09.527 --> 00:13:22.527]  Homeownership has been pushed out of reach for millions with the rate of 30 year mortgages up 177 percent since I left office.
[00:13:22.527 --> 00:13:26.527]  And by the way, that's nothing compared to energy where we were energy independent.
[00:13:26.527 --> 00:13:29.527]  And now you look at what's happened to energy.
[00:13:29.527 --> 00:13:31.527]  We're getting our energy from Venezuela.
[00:13:31.527 --> 00:13:40.527]  You believe that what real wages collapsed 26 months in a row, real wages because of inflation and various other things that are happening.
[00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:44.527]  Twenty twenty four is our final battle with you on my side.
[00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:46.527]  We will demolish the deep state.
[00:13:46.527 --> 00:13:50.527]  We will expel the warmongers from our government.
[00:13:50.527 --> 00:13:52.527]  We will drive out the globalists.
[00:13:52.527 --> 00:13:56.527]  We will cast out the communists, Marxists, fascists.
[00:13:56.527 --> 00:14:03.527]  We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country and we will rout the fake news media.
[00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:09.527]  We will defeat crooked Joe Biden and we will drain the swamp once and for all.
[00:14:09.527 --> 00:14:12.527]  We made a lot of progress, but it's pretty deep.
[00:14:12.527 --> 00:14:13.527]  I want to explain something to everybody.
[00:14:13.527 --> 00:14:14.527]  I know Trump.
[00:14:14.527 --> 00:14:16.527]  I know how the government works.
[00:14:17.527 --> 00:14:24.527]  Literally pointed out Fiona Hill and McMaster to Trump and that they work for Soros.
[00:14:24.527 --> 00:14:27.527]  And then she went on 60 Minutes and cried and said, Alex Jones got me fired.
[00:14:27.527 --> 00:14:29.527]  I don't say that to my horn.
[00:14:29.527 --> 00:14:31.527]  I had the CIA come after me.
[00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:32.527]  They ran the lawsuits.
[00:14:32.527 --> 00:14:33.527]  All of it.
[00:14:33.527 --> 00:14:34.527]  It's all coming out.
[00:14:34.527 --> 00:14:39.527]  And there's unlimited funding still by Obama and Hillary in the deep state to do this.
[00:14:39.527 --> 00:14:40.527]  Trump did not understand all this.
[00:14:40.527 --> 00:14:42.527]  He does now.
[00:14:42.527 --> 00:14:44.527]  And it's super hardcore.
[00:14:44.527 --> 00:14:49.527]  And is the president was reelected, had it stolen and is directly challenging them.
[00:14:49.527 --> 00:14:50.527]  And you heard it.
[00:14:50.527 --> 00:14:53.527]  They are fascists that control people through communism.
[00:14:53.527 --> 00:14:55.527]  They're going to stay in power permanently.
[00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:56.527]  I have more clips on this coming up.
[00:14:56.527 --> 00:14:58.527]  He said even more powerful stuff.
[00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:00.527]  And he said the key.
[00:15:00.527 --> 00:15:02.527]  And that first clip.
[00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:05.527]  He said, we have to beat these people.
[00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:07.527]  We do not have a choice.
[00:15:08.527 --> 00:15:16.527]  They are cementing a permanent dictatorship of the bureaucracy and the corporations and destroying the economy to control us.
[00:15:16.527 --> 00:15:21.527]  Because that's how communists control you, is by destroying the economy for the general public.
[00:15:21.527 --> 00:15:27.527]  Venezuela was a rich, wealthy country 25 years ago.
[00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:31.527]  Hugo Chavez ran it in the ground with promises to the masses about free goodies.
[00:15:31.527 --> 00:15:33.527]  Same thing's been done everywhere.
[00:15:34.527 --> 00:15:37.527]  This is a plan beyond cloward and pivot.
[00:15:37.527 --> 00:15:39.527]  So we have no choice.
[00:15:39.527 --> 00:15:41.527]  We must defeat these people.
[00:15:41.527 --> 00:15:43.527]  Yes, our country is occupied.
[00:15:43.527 --> 00:15:45.527]  Yes, our country has been captured.
[00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:49.527]  Trump goes all out, warns U.S. now under globalist dictatorship.
[00:15:49.527 --> 00:15:51.527]  Knowing that is half the battle.
[00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:53.527]  Now we remove the dictatorship.
[00:15:59.527 --> 00:16:01.527]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:03.527]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:04.527]  They have a lot of power.
[00:16:04.527 --> 00:16:05.527]  But they can be defeated.
[00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:08.527]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:16:08.527 --> 00:16:17.527]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:16:17.527 --> 00:16:20.527]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:22.527]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:16:22.527 --> 00:16:25.527]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.527]  It purifies very quickly.
[00:16:27.527 --> 00:16:30.527]  And it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:16:30.527 --> 00:16:32.527]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:34.527]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:37.527]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.

[00:16:49.527 --> 00:16:56.527]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:16:56.527 --> 00:16:59.527]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:16:59.527 --> 00:17:03.527]  In the short time we have, I can't get into all the incredible ingredients in Super Female Vitality.
[00:17:03.527 --> 00:17:05.527]  Go to InfowarStore.com.
[00:17:05.527 --> 00:17:06.527]  Read about the ingredients.
[00:17:06.527 --> 00:17:07.527]  Look them up for yourself.

[00:17:22.527 --> 00:17:23.527]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[00:17:23.527 --> 00:17:28.527]  But the good news is we have several thousand bottles left of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:29.527]  It boosts men.
[00:17:29.527 --> 00:17:30.527]  It boosts women.
[00:17:30.527 --> 00:17:31.527]  It works great.
[00:17:31.527 --> 00:17:33.527]  But women like pink labels.
[00:17:33.527 --> 00:17:35.527]  Men like different color labels.
[00:17:35.527 --> 00:17:37.527]  So, it works for men as well.
[00:17:37.527 --> 00:17:38.527]  It's the same formula.
[00:17:38.527 --> 00:17:39.527]  It's an incredible formula.

[00:17:59.527 --> 00:18:01.527]  Turbo Force is back.
[00:18:01.527 --> 00:18:02.527]  Sold out for eight months.
[00:18:02.527 --> 00:18:04.527]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:18:04.527 --> 00:18:06.527]  We made it even stronger.
[00:18:06.527 --> 00:18:10.527]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:17.527]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:23.527]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:18:23.527 --> 00:18:25.527]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:18:25.527 --> 00:18:29.527]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things.
[00:18:29.527 --> 00:18:33.527]  And amino acids that turbocharge everything.
[00:18:33.527 --> 00:18:36.527]  And are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:18:36.527 --> 00:18:40.527]  It is the super fuel.
[00:18:40.527 --> 00:18:42.527]  Rain Force Plus is great.
[00:18:42.527 --> 00:18:43.527]  Rain Force Ultra is great.
[00:18:43.527 --> 00:18:44.527]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:18:44.527 --> 00:18:45.527]  They go good with this.
[00:18:45.527 --> 00:18:47.527]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:18:47.527 --> 00:18:49.527]  This is the boss.
[00:18:49.527 --> 00:18:50.527]  Turbo Force.
[00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:51.527]  Back in stock.
[00:18:51.527 --> 00:18:52.527]  Discounted.
[00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:54.527]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:18:54.527 --> 00:18:55.527]  More power.
[00:18:55.527 --> 00:18:56.527]  More strength.
[00:18:56.527 --> 00:18:57.527]  More energy.
[00:19:00.527 --> 00:19:02.527]  They decided to not perp walking.
[00:19:02.527 --> 00:19:03.527]  Not put him in handcuffs.
[00:19:03.527 --> 00:19:04.527]  Not do a mug shot.
[00:19:04.527 --> 00:19:06.527]  Because they knew that that would help Trump.
[00:19:06.527 --> 00:19:08.527]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[00:19:08.527 --> 00:19:10.527]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[00:19:10.527 --> 00:19:11.527]  We learned today they wouldn't have it.
[00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:12.527]  So we've made our own.
[00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.527]  And it says, Political Prisoner.
[00:19:14.527 --> 00:19:17.527]  With an image of President Trump.
[00:19:17.527 --> 00:19:19.527]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[00:19:19.527 --> 00:19:21.527]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:23.527]  Political Prisoner.
[00:19:23.527 --> 00:19:25.527]  With Trump on the front.
[00:19:25.527 --> 00:19:28.527]  They're in a mug shot jail background.
[00:19:28.527 --> 00:19:29.527]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:19:29.527 --> 00:19:33.527]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:35.527]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[00:19:35.527 --> 00:19:36.527]  No, I'm not running for President.
[00:19:36.527 --> 00:19:38.527]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[00:19:38.527 --> 00:19:39.527]  Red, white, and blue.
[00:19:39.527 --> 00:19:40.527]  Alex Jones for President.
[00:19:40.527 --> 00:19:41.527]  2024.
[00:19:41.527 --> 00:19:43.527]  It's a fun conversational piece.
[00:19:43.527 --> 00:19:44.527]  And a limited edition shirt.
[00:19:44.527 --> 00:19:46.527]  Great way to fund the operation.
[00:19:46.527 --> 00:19:54.527]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mug shot shirts at Infowars.com
[00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:58.527]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:20:00.527 --> 00:20:05.527]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.527 --> 00:20:07.527]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:22.740]  My leverage over college accreditors, we are going to choke off the money to schools
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:31.620]  that aid the Marxist assault on our American heritage and on Western civilization itself.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:37.780]  The days of subsidizing communist indoctrination in our colleges will soon be over.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.540]  And you know, I will say this, this is a, I would say, very largely conservative group.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.900]  I call it common sense group because I think a lot of conservatism is common sense.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:55.000]  When they ask you for a definition, it starts with common sense, but I tell them very often
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.820]  that you will be shocked to see colleges, even the ones that you hear are most liberal,
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.220]  we have tremendous numbers of people out there.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.020]  I think even more, they don't speak up as much, but they're starting to speak up.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.820]  You know, when you see Bud Light, and when you see all of the things that have happened,
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:18.780]  I mean, you take a look at that, they're down 37%, the company is, nobody's ever seen it.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.540]  And you know, the, the radical left has always used that.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.260]  They've used their body power, they'd sort of name a company, go after a company.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.260]  We've never done it.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.140]  That just happened by osmosis, actually.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.420]  But it's also happening.
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.780]  I heard Target mentioned today and various others.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.780]  And we have tremendous power to make sure that our country goes down the right tracks.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:44.780]  We're going to smash the Marxist diversity, equity and inclusion bureaucracies that are
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:50.180]  driving up tuition costs and sticking you with crushing debt.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.620]  And for any universities that want federal student loan dollars, we will also require
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:22:01.340]  them to offer real job placement and career services as well as options for accelerated
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.220]  and low cost degrees.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:12.700]  Various institutions have gone up, the pricing has gone up more than just about any industry.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.580]  You look at their costs, and they drive them up because the federal government gives loans
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.580]  to everybody.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.580]  So it's more expensive.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.860]  But somebody has to pay back that loan, except under Biden.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.740]  But the Supreme Court decided that that wasn't going to happen.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.820]  All right.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.180]  And I'm not an apologist for Trump.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.180]  I have issues with him.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.860]  But he's the real deal.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.860]  They're coming after him.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.860]  They're scared.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.420]  There's a clip we've got where Trump announces he's nice to Hillary now because they are friends.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.980]  What happened to Donald Trump?
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.620]  Never back down, ask.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:47.020]  Trump is being sarcastic there when he says, I'm not for, we're not going to call her Crooked
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.700]  Hillary anymore because she's out of it.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.700]  Right.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.460]  And now it's Crooked Biden.
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.500]  That is a very astute statement.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:02.660]  The Clinton crime syndicate is another arm that shared power with the group behind Obama.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.540]  The globalist clique that controls Obama is in control of Biden and is quarterbacking
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.540]  things.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.500]  And the Bidens and the Clintons, the Obamas and the Clintons actually don't like each other.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.260]  That's well known.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:20.780]  And so Trump's explaining, Hillary's out of it.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.020]  Hillary is no longer a contender with her foundation and her system.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.620]  They're done.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.860]  Their dynasty, their cult, the left worshiping them, all their minions that were promised
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.940]  jobs and things if she got in, they were so pissed off.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.900]  They're gone now.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:41.540]  And Obama and that arm is who we're dealing with 100% with John Kerry and all of it.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:47.160]  That's the clique and a bunch of neocons working with them.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.140]  So people see this and they go, what does he mean by that?
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.140]  He's explaining their political dynasty is over.
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.620]  And they've been slowly cut out the last two and a half years by Biden.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.060]  And so now it's an Obama third term.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.060]  Here it is.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.660]  The name crooked away from Hillary.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.340]  And we gave her a new name.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.340]  Beautiful.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.340]  I call beautiful.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.340]  And.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:13.780]  And but I took it away because I want it.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.380]  I don't believe in the same name for two people.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.380]  I don't like that.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.700]  And I've never done this before.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700]  You know, I haven't.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.260]  And you have to live with that name for the rest of your life.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.500]  I'll go over the different names, but I won't, because many of them are now friends of mine.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.500]  OK.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.900]  So what he just did was declare victory over her and say she's politically dead.
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.580]  He's not in it anymore is the full clip.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.580]  That's what that is.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:39.380]  And he's explaining our main battle is with the Obamanoids.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.620]  The Bidenites, because, yeah, they're just puppets at one level, but there's different
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:54.260]  camps and the globalist camp like Alexander Soros is absolutely behind the Obama crew.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.340]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:02.420]  Remember, Trump said this back in the last campaign in 2016 or the campaign before last.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.680]  He said, listen, I know you pay them off and it's all legal because I've had to buy most
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.500]  people on the stage and I want to fix the system.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.580]  He just got up there and said, the problem is too many federal dollars to own education.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.460]  The more you throw it, the more it creates inflation and there's these big corrupt institutions.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:24.380]  We need accelerated degrees, accelerated new colleges, new systems that teach you basic
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.700]  business and then basic trades.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:31.260]  And then if you want after that, get a doctorate or an engineer degree.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.700]  That's what everything's moving towards.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:39.340]  And Trump's telling people that now when we open the phones up, I want to talk about Trump.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.340]  You can attack him.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.340]  You can say you love him.
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.940]  But regardless, what do you think the globalists are going to do to try to stop him?
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.580]  Because they're kangaroo trials.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.700]  All of this is just going to make him bigger.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.140]  Constitution says he can run from prison.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.340]  Even if they accelerate these trials and say, put him in jail three months before the election,
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.380]  that's the soonest they could.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.020]  That's going to blow up in their face.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.940]  And no matter how much election fraud there is, when you're winning by 30, 40 points, there's
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:10.300]  not enough dead people that they can put in the machines with their system of fraud that
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.180]  Facebook helps set up to take them past that.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.660]  And then he can pardon himself from the prison.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.380]  They're not going to let it get to that, though.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:26.180]  So we should not be overconfident here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.940]  There's a very good chance that the deep state is going to try to assassinate Trump.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.940]  We know it's already happened.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.780]  I hope they don't.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.420]  But this is such a dangerous period.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.820]  We're at war with Russia.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.740]  They're trying to start war with China right now.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.180]  I'm not a fan of, but I don't want war with them.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.140]  Here's Washington Post.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.300]  Would allies fight with U.S. for Taiwan?
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.860]  Japan is wary.
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:55.060]  And so Biden's saying, are you ready for war with China, too?
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.820]  So this whole world is teetering, and they're trying to bring in the new global government,
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.260]  the new central bank digital currencies.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:05.460]  They're trying to bring in the new SDGs.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.220]  You've heard of ESGs, but they're commanded by the SDGs.
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.220]  So are we talking about SDGs here today?
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.740]  I mean, I cannot stress to you enough that I hear people say, life's so boring, Netflix
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.740]  shows.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.220]  That's because you're watching, the majority of the public is watching up to five hours
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:30.980]  a day of Netflix alone of the most trashily boring, low grade, high school play level crap
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.700]  with a bunch of CG.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.860]  And if you're watching crap like that, you're not in the real world.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.580]  So you're bored.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.540]  Wall Street Journal also reported the same headline.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.100]  If you're awake and living in the real world, my friend, you're not bored.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.740]  You are horrified.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.020]  But also very excited.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.340]  People ask, man, Jones, you kind of seem tired before you get on air, and as soon as you
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.340]  get on air, you're like electric.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.420]  Well, I mean, when we're sitting here talking about race-specific bioweapons that'll kill
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.660]  my whole family and a very good chance they're going to release them, I mean, I'm kind of
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.660]  pissed off.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.660]  You know what?
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.660]  I kind of like living.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.780]  I don't just roll over when somebody walks up and punches me in the face.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.660]  And are you going to roll over?
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.660]  Because that's really what the question is here.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.660]  We're going to go to break.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.460]  I'm going to get more to Trump later.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.420]  I want to get into the incredible movements against the New World Order and the WHO and
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:23.860]  the European Parliament, incredible developments, incredible clips coming up, and so much more.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:29.020]  Please remember, we've got Patriot Pride Month to counter all the leftist pedo-pride.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.420]  Just pride in freedom, pride in God, pride in America, pride in promoting our freedom
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.420]  against tyranny.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.500]  I really just want to counter their whole pedo-pride stuff.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:43.580]  Storewide, double Patriot points, up to 60% off, 10% off storable food, water filtration,
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.460]  infowarestore.com, nitric boost, so good for your blood, so good to clean you out,
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.180]  super fuel vitality, 60% off, works on males too, it's the same formula, but we're sold
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:56.060]  out of super male, brain force plus, brain force ultra, both 50% off individually, all
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.460]  of it, infowarestore.com.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.180]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.900]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have a lot of power, but they can be
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900]  defeated.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.900]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.020]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.820]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with, and you do it with the
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.700]  highest quality gravity fed filter out there.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.900]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.700]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day, it purifies very quickly
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.900]  and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.420]  This is what I use, which my family uses, it's the very best system out there for the
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:39.540]  lowest price, for a limited time, 10% off on top of that, exclusively at infowarestore.com

[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.100]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.740]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.420]  from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.140]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.340]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Info War Store at Info War's life, not at a probiotic
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.340]  for more than three years?
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.740]  And the answer is simple.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.660]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.820]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:19.100]  They got bought by a Lybtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones,
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.100]  anymore.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:25.500]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.580]  We're able to private label it under Info War's MD as our probiotic formula.

[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.340]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride, ours don't, and it doesn't have fillers in
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:39.660]  it, it is just chock-full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.

[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.420]  some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:59.020]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time at infowarestore.com.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:03.820]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.380]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.020]  So let me get this straight.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.980]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing that during the
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.380]  Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter to force
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.580]  the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption, an event that
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.020]  Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.660]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:32.660]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:38.420]  swore was Russian disinformation and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:43.100]  all while the FBI investigates Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.540]  letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.660]  launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.100]  by the Clinton campaign.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.300]  Do I have that all straight?
[00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:08.910]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:17.210]  I've got a tiger by the tail to explain the scene.
[00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:22.210]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.210]  He never gives up.
[00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.210]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.210]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.210]  Worldwide.
[00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:40.210]  Last night on the Sunday broadcast, I answered a very common question I get.
[00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.210]  Really, any time I go out in public.
[00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:46.210]  Any crowd, I get the question at least once.
[00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:53.210]  Is Tucker Carlson for real? Is Joe Rogan for real? Is President Trump for real? Is RFK Jr. for real? Is Elon Musk for real?
[00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.210]  Things like that.
[00:33:55.210 --> 00:34:02.210]  And I say, well, I don't really know about Elon Musk, but I've known Joe Rogan for 25 years, and I've known Tucker for over 10.
[00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:05.210]  And yeah, they're totally for real. Doesn't mean they're perfect. Neither am I.
[00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.210]  And yeah, Trump's for real.
[00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:12.210]  He for real scares the globalists. He for real is the president. He for real is his own man.
[00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.210]  Does he make mistakes? Absolutely. Do I disagree with him some? Absolutely.
[00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:24.210]  But that's an important question, because people say, well, then why is all the prominent people, from Russell Brand to you name it, Tulsi Gabbard's list goes on and on.
[00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:28.210]  Why are they all coming out against the New World Order?
[00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:34.210]  If you tune into the Fox News shows, the guy that replaced Tucker sounds like me every night.
[00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:42.210]  What's happened in the world? How has it gone from Infowars being the first popular show decades ago covering the New World Order?
[00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:49.210]  Because before it was kind of academic type guys covering it and putting out films and writing books and having a huge effect.
[00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.210]  The most effective before me would be a G. Edward Griffin.
[00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:58.210]  And then an Aaron Russo. It's not about who's good or who's bad or who's the goat.
[00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:01.210]  It's about understanding what's happening now.
[00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:05.210]  So Megyn Kelly's been coming out and saying nice things about me.
[00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:12.210]  Why is that? Someone who attacked me, someone that was hired by the system to be a mercenary.
[00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:17.210]  Fired by the system now out on her own.
[00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:22.210]  Because she failed as a mercenary and now she sees which way the wind blows.
[00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.210]  She's a lawyer. She now is not just saying nice things about me.
[00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:32.210]  She's basically trying to become Tucker Carlson, which is Alex Jones 2.0.
[00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:36.210]  Now, I want to get into the incredible developments in Europe here in a moment.
[00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.210]  But first, here she is on Alex Jones, the gay frogs.
[00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:44.210]  I remember interviewing Alex Jones and he was saying all the crazy things about frogs.
[00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.210]  And I was like, oh, my Lord, this guy's a lunatic.
[00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.210]  And then we went back and checked it. And lo and behold, the son of a bitch was right.
[00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:57.210]  The frogs are turning female, like the water's turning frogs into girl frog, boy frogs into girl frogs.
[00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.210]  It's happening. They're like trans frogs and they're gay trans frogs.
[00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:06.210]  I'm like, he's a lunatic. It was true. But it doesn't mean it's happening to humans.
[00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.210]  There is a leap to be made there.
[00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.210]  That's what I want to know.
[00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.210]  I'm telling you, it's bizarre shit.
[00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.210]  Let me just tell you.
[00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:18.210]  Really, I went back to NBC and I'm like, oh, he's a lunatic.
[00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.210]  And then the NBC fact-checking team came back and they're like, it's true.
[00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.210]  I'm like, oh, my God.
[00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.210]  But of course, they didn't put that in the NBC piece.
[00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:32.210]  So what does that signify? It's not about Alex Jones being right.
[00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:37.210]  It's that that's a maxim in the face of the system saying you did everything you could to shut this guy down,
[00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:41.210]  to demonize him, to lie about him, to misrepresent who he was.
[00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.210]  But it's failed. We didn't buy your propaganda.
[00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:48.210]  And we know that we, the people, are right and that you, the globalists, are wrong.
[00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:54.210]  And now across the board, every major talk show host is hat tipping to this broadcast,
[00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:58.210]  except a handful of people like the young turds, the young turks.
[00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:02.210]  And they've even been coming out now and saying nice things about Trump
[00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:06.210]  because they realize that people have moved on.
[00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:16.210]  Trump won the straw poll of Republicans at turning point by, what was it, 75 points?
[00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.210]  I mean, just absolutely amazing.
[00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.210]  In fact, it doesn't say on here. I want to remember it was 75.
[00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.210]  Will you guys grab this? It's a clip right here. It's Charlie Kirk.
[00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:31.210]  We played the clip last night. I've actually got it in my stack.
[00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:36.210]  The point is he won it by an even larger margin than the Rasmussen poll that had him at 72.
[00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:43.210]  So this is a total rejection of the power structure's power grab.
[00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.210]  But let's talk about what's happening in Europe and then get into the ESG,
[00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:53.210]  the next level of the ESG, why the ESG supposedly being scrapped is not being scrapped.
[00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:58.210]  And it's really about the SDGs. But that's OK. We're going to scrap the SDGs, too.
[00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:03.210]  You're like, oh, we fought and exposed the ESGs, and now they're removing those.
[00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.210]  Well, they're not going to give up at first.
[00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:09.210]  You've got to pound them in the face politically, nonviolently.
[00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:12.210]  Just because they play possum doesn't mean you give up.
[00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.210]  You have to make sure they've been defeated.
[00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:19.210]  And they're far from defeated, but, yes, we're on the initiative.
[00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.210]  That's what I want people to know.
[00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.210]  We're on the front foot. They're on the back foot.
[00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.210]  We're on our toes. They're on their heels.
[00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.210]  Now, I want to go to this amazing clip.
[00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:37.210]  Just last week, she said, you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:44.210]  Christina Anderson, a member of the European Union Parliament and now a leading leader,
[00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:49.210]  says European citizens' initiative against the WHO power grab will not stop,
[00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.210]  that they're going to defeat them.
[00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.210]  And it's super popular now, whether you're in Italy or whether you're in Germany,
[00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.210]  whether you're in the Netherlands, whether you're in France,
[00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:02.210]  whether you're in the U.K., Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales, to be anti-New World Order.
[00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:05.210]  It's the hottest thing. People get it.
[00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.210]  They know about the ruling class. They know about the WHO.
[00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.210]  They know about Bill Gates. They know they made the virus.
[00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.210]  They know they released it. They know the shots are poison.
[00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.210]  The coroners are all coming out saying we've never seen these blood clots before.
[00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:17.210]  They're killing everybody. Yeah, they heard us bad.
[00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:19.210]  They killed a bunch of us. They maimed a bunch of us.
[00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.210]  But guess what? We know they did it.
[00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.210]  And their censorship didn't work.
[00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:27.210]  And the CIA and the Justice Department taking down 55 million posts on Facebook alone
[00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.210]  covering the truth of COVID didn't keep the truth from getting out.
[00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:36.210]  And now the murder you committed, New World Order, occupational globalist dictatorship,
[00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.210]  will never be forgotten. And we know you did it.
[00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:43.210]  And we know you're going to try to cut the power off with fake cyber attacks.
[00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.210]  We know you're going to try to start nuclear war with Russia. We know.
[00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:51.210]  But any way you slice it, you murdering criminals, you're going to jail.
[00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:56.210]  Emergency broadcast, Trump goes all out, warns U.S. now under globalist dictatorship.
[00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.210]  See the video? Infowars.com.
[00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.210]  And you're like, what's the good news in that?
[00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:06.210]  Because it's being admitted, a dictatorship of the bureaucracy and the media.
[00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.210]  But they don't have a dictatorship of your mind, of your house, of your backyard,
[00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.210]  of your farm, of your business, of your school, of your church.
[00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:17.210]  Their only beachhead is in your mind.
[00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:23.210]  But as they bring out the ESGs and the cutoff of the industry
[00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.210]  and their own admissions to cut off the power for control,
[00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:29.210]  then they get us in a position of under siege.
[00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:34.210]  And now we're like a bird in a cage that only lives if they bring us water and food.
[00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:38.210]  We do not want to get to that position of being prisoners.
[00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.210]  But that's what the COVID lockdowns were in their own admission.
[00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:47.210]  A radical transformation from a free society with open mobility and choice to tyranny.
[00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.210]  That's the QR codes.
[00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:54.210]  That's the Amazon Whole Foods wanting you to scan to go in.
[00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.210]  And people are pulling out and not going to Amazon.
[00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:58.210]  They're closing stores.
[00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.210]  Go to the mom and pop.
[00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:03.210]  Go to the place that's got rotting manoleum on the floor to buy your food.
[00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:07.210]  People pay half the price anyways because it's going to be those systems
[00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.210]  that are going to let us survive in the future.
[00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.210]  It doesn't mean you can't sometimes go to a big corporation
[00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.210]  or you don't fly on a corporate airplane.
[00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.210]  It doesn't mean that you can always avoid it.
[00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:21.210]  But when you can, don't give your money to the Fortune 500.
[00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.210]  They are unified.
[00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.210]  They want your children.
[00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.210]  They literally want to cut your son's genitals off.
[00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:30.210]  Old elites just wanted to capture and control your country.
[00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:32.210]  Sometimes they kill the men.
[00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.210]  They want to get rid of our men, period.
[00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.210]  They want to get rid of our future.
[00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.210]  They want to capture us forever.
[00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:43.210]  They want to annihilate us.
[00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.210]  Like in Last of the Mohicans, it's a composite of true stories
[00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:52.210]  and real things that went on, but it's fiction, historical fiction.
[00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:55.210]  There's the last Mohican there.
[00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.210]  Daniel Day-Lewis is a half-breed.
[00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:59.210]  There's one Mohican left.
[00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.210]  And the underchief of the other tribe that's been fighting him
[00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.210]  for hundreds of years says,
[00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.210]  today not just you die, but your seed dies,
[00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:11.210]  and forever your people leave the face of this earth.
[00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.210]  See if you can find the HD version of that.
[00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.210]  Last time I wanted to play it, you guys found that quick.
[00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.210]  How did you find that in five seconds?
[00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.210]  Yeah, crank this up.
[00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.210]  Go ahead and turn it up.
[00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.210]  Crank the audio up.
[00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.210]  Skip the break.
[00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:23.210]  I don't know how you guys found that in five seconds.
[00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.210]  I am seriously impressed because this is not a scripted show.
[00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:28.210]  They did not know I was about to do that.
[00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.210]  I don't have audio because he's pulling it up on YouTube.
[00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.210]  How fast can you type?
[00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:36.210]  How did you pull up the exact scene in five seconds?
[00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:38.210]  I'm impressed.
[00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.210]  Pull it into the computer and let's play it.
[00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:44.210]  But you have to understand, that's what this is, okay?
[00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:49.210]  And the seed of freedom and the Christians, it's not a race of people.
[00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.210]  It's that they want to kill the Renaissance.
[00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.210]  They want to kill the prosperity because they're bringing in a new dark age of tyranny
[00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:57.210]  upon the world.
[00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:01.210]  So emergency broadcast, Trump goes all out, warns U.S. under globalist dictatorship.
[00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.210]  This is so important.
[00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.210]  And what's happening overseas?
[00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.210]  Major coalitions have formed.
[00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.210]  They're winning national elections, local elections in every European country.
[00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.210]  Russia, I've watched Russian TV, folks.
[00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:18.210]  This isn't stuff pointed at us because I wanted to make sure, like five years ago,
[00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:21.210]  they're claiming they're becoming more Christian, anti-globalist.
[00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:25.210]  I'm like, is that just propaganda on RT to make American conservatives support Russians?
[00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.210]  I started going and looking, and I mean, you turn on national Russian TV,
[00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.210]  it's like the talk show hosts are all Alex Jones.
[00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:36.210]  They'll have some idiot liberal on there too, but it's half the talk show hosts
[00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.210]  aren't just mainline conservatives.
[00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.210]  They're anti-new world order, know the whole thing.
[00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.210]  We don't want war with America or China.
[00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:44.210]  We want prosperity.
[00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.210]  We want freedom.
[00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.210]  We want right to religion.
[00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.210]  We want to own guns.
[00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.210]  We don't want our sons to have their penises cut off.
[00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.210]  That's on the Russian TV.
[00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:59.210]  I go read the transcripts of it, all over Russian TV, and I've confirmed,
[00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.210]  because the Russians talk about it on their TV when I'm not even on it.
[00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.210]  I've been a guest on some of those shows.
[00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.210]  They're like, and we learn from people like Alex Jones what's going on,
[00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:09.210]  and we're now aware of it, and I'm not bragging.
[00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:11.210]  I want the listeners to know there was no show like this.
[00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.210]  Nigel Farage has come on many times and said the majority of the UKIP,
[00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:19.210]  and the reason UKIP exploded was Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson 20 years ago,
[00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:26.210]  15 years ago, when we were already like 20th on Alexa in the UK website.
[00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:31.210]  At one point we were like number 20, and people were tuning in for the first time.
[00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.210]  We had millions of UK listeners a day for a long time.
[00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.210]  We still have a big audience.
[00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.210]  You've heard them.
[00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.210]  But used to, I'd open the phones up.
[00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:40.210]  It'd be like half the calls are from the UK.
[00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.210]  So that's the power of this broadcast.
[00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.210]  That's the power of what we've all done together, and I salute you,
[00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.210]  and I thank you.
[00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.210]  This is amazing.
[00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:52.210]  So as negative as things are, I want the globalists who are in their own bubbles,
[00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:57.210]  too, to know they're losing, and the people are against them.
[00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.210]  Oh, Alex owes a billion and a half dollars.
[00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:00.210]  Alex Jones is a loser.
[00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:06.210]  Alex Jones is going down, and they just can't stand the fact that the truth's coming out.
[00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.210]  Did you know the Democrat Party law firm that, quote,
[00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:16.210]  pro bono is trying to shut this company down in our bankruptcy, our reorganization,
[00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:25.210]  has been spending $1 million a month trying to shut us down, $1 million a month,
[00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:28.210]  and we're spending around $100,000 to block that.
[00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.210]  So we're in a war with these people.
[00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.210]  Do you understand that?
[00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:35.210]  When you go to Infowarsstore.com and buy books and buy films and buy supplements
[00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:38.210]  and buy T-shirts and do that, you're literally funding something
[00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:42.210]  that the New World Order dragon is blasting everything it's got at us,
[00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:47.210]  shut them down, shut it up now.
[00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:50.210]  Well, I want to declare victory, not over the whole war, but over the battle.
[00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.210]  This operation is victorious.
[00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.210]  All glory goes to Christ.
[00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:57.210]  We have now converted all the major opposition.
[00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.210]  People now get the whole paradigm, the whole globalist operation.
[00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.210]  They now know the game.
[00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:04.210]  They know how it operates, and once you see it, you can't unsee it.
[00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:06.210]  They're not getting info from me now.
[00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.210]  They see it.
[00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:08.210]  They get it.
[00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:11.210]  And once you click, there ain't no going back.
[00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.210]  I can't tell you about the Matrix, folks.
[00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.210]  You just take the red pill, and I'll take you to Wonderland,
[00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:19.210]  and you'll see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.210]  So we've reached that Morpheus moment.
[00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:24.210]  Did you guys pull Alastair Mohicans in place?
[00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:31.210]  Okay, let's play the short clip that I'm going to play.
[00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.210]  Christina Anderson, this is such a key clip.
[00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:38.210]  But here's the scene where he tells Alastair Mohicans,
[00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.210]  I'm going to kill you now, and it's the end of your people right now.
[00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.210]  And that's what the new order wants, total domination.
[00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.210]  Here it is.
[00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:52.210]  I don't want your son's testicles, your daughter's breast and uterus.
[00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:59.210]  Total domination.
[00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:02.210]  I'll narrate this for radio listeners.
[00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.210]  She's telling the bad guys, telling her to come with him,
[00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:09.210]  so she jumps off a cliff instead.
[00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:12.210]  And then the other folks catch up to him.
[00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.210]  You have the final fight scene, and we can skip ahead to that.
[00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:22.210]  But the point is, is that this is an allegory of what we're talking about.
[00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:26.210]  The new world order is never going to stop, folks, until they're defeated.
[00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.210]  Think about it.
[00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.210]  Is Satanism taking place?
[00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.210]  Is pedophilia taking place?
[00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.210]  Yeah, you know it is.
[00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:36.210]  I mean, they're openly chopping girls' forearms.
[00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.210]  As Russell means, I was good friends with him, a great guy.
[00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:41.210]  The media would misrepresent what he said and did.
[00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:42.210]  He was a really good guy.
[00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.210]  Here, go ahead and crank this up.
[00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:49.210]  Here's the final thing.
[00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.210]  They cut little girls' forearms and thighs out
[00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.210]  and create giant fake penises that don't work
[00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.210]  with a piece of PVC plastic pipe to pee out of.
[00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:59.210]  I mean, how crazy and satanic is that?
[00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.210]  And they call it care.
[00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:05.210]  The evil is out of the open.
[00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:13.210]  It's just right there.
[00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:23.210]  If they get you to accept that, you'll accept anything.
[00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.210]  I mean, what's coming next for these people?
[00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:29.210]  Well, you know, humans grown in tanks.
[00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:43.210]  The WHO says that by 2030, no children can be born in the womb.
[00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:49.210]  All artificial.
[00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.210]  And I guess it's earlier in the movie he says,
[00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:52.210]  I'm going to get you, I'm going to destroy your seed,
[00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:58.210]  I'm going to kill you and your people forever.
[00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.210]  That's good.
[00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:03.210]  And in post, have them find the part right before it resets,
[00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.210]  I'm going to kill your people forever,
[00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.210]  and just add that in there when we post the Band-Aid video.
[00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.210]  Thank you.
[00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:09.210]  All right, let me get back to what I was saying,
[00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.210]  because there's so much news to hit we've got to get to.
[00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:16.210]  Let's get to having a major meeting, a major conference,
[00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.210]  and you've got real leadership here from this amazing lady,
[00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.210]  Christina Anderson, out of Germany.
[00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.210]  And here she is explaining to the globalists that the beginning
[00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.210]  and the end is not, here it is.
[00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:32.210]  Because an unelected body like WHO,
[00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:36.210]  who is controlled and run by multibillionaires,
[00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:45.210]  should never be allowed to act in place of a democratically elected government.
[00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:53.210]  They will be exposed, each and every one of them, by name.
[00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.210]  Because guess what?
[00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.210]  There is elections coming up,
[00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:05.210]  and the people might be interested in who is responsible for the abolition of democracy.
[00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:23.210]  Yeah, thank you so much for coming today.
[00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:28.210]  And thank you, Misla, for really putting in the work and making this happening today.
[00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:32.210]  And I really will have to say I am so very honored
[00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:37.210]  to be here with seven very brave citizens
[00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:45.210]  who came here today to launch an initiative for a European Citizens Initiative.
[00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:51.210]  An initiative which will hopefully be accepted by the EU Commission,
[00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:55.210]  although I don't really hold my breath, to be quite frank,
[00:50:55.210 --> 00:51:00.210]  but I seriously hope we will be able to do that.
[00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:05.210]  These seven citizens are so incredibly brave
[00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:10.210]  because they stand up against the despicable attempts
[00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:19.210]  by the globalitarian misanthropists to strip us of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.
[00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:29.210]  They simply say no to the attempts of granting an unelected body governing powers.
[00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:32.210]  They simply say no.
[00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.210]  And that's what we all should do.
[00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:40.210]  Because this will end if we simply say no.
[00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.210]  And that's what we're here to do today.
[00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:47.210]  Because an unelected body like WHO,
[00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:51.210]  who is controlled and run by multibillionaires,
[00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:59.210]  should never be allowed to act in place of a democratically elected government.
[00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.210]  Never, ever.
[00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:04.210]  In democracies, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:11.210]  it is government of the people, by the people, for the people.
[00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:16.210]  And any government anywhere in the world
[00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:20.210]  who disregards this fundamental principle of democracy
[00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:25.210]  by supporting this unprecedented power grab by WHO
[00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:34.210]  is an anti-democrat demonstrating nothing but its utter contempt for the people.
[00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:41.210]  And these seven brave citizens, they will not stand for this and neither will we.
[00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:48.210]  I will expose anyone, whether it's a member of a government in a member state
[00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.210]  or a government around the world,
[00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:55.210]  or a member of parliament in the European member states
[00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:58.210]  or parliaments around the world,
[00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:04.210]  who do not respect the people and do not respect democracy,
[00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:09.210]  I will see to it they will be exposed.
[00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:13.210]  Each and every one of them, by name.
[00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.210]  Because guess what?
[00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:19.210]  There's elections coming up and the people might be interested
[00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:25.210]  in who is responsible for the abolition of democracy.
[00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:30.210]  So, we are here today to tell you,
[00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.210]  WHO globalitarian misanthropists,
[00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:37.210]  we are here today to tell you,
[00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:40.210]  you picked this fight, you wanted this fight,
[00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.210]  well, guess what?
[00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:44.210]  You've got it.
[00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.210]  Let's fight.
[00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:51.210]  Because these brave citizens, my colleagues and I,
[00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:57.210]  we will not tire to fight you every step of the way.
[00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:06.210]  These brave seven citizens and millions and millions more around the world,
[00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:12.210]  these are the people you will have to reckon with from now on.
[00:54:12.210 --> 00:54:20.210]  Because we are millions, millions around the world.
[00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:26.210]  It is you that is the small fringe minority.
[00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:32.210]  You are the ones who do not have the right to dictate to the people
[00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:38.210]  what they want and what they don't want.
[00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:41.210]  So, take it from me, take it from us,
[00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:45.210]  take it from these seven citizens who gathered here today,
[00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:50.210]  take it from the millions and millions of people around the world,
[00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:54.210]  we will bring you down.
[00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:59.210]  And we will not tire until we have done just that.
[00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:03.210]  So, brace yourselves, we are here, and the fight is on.
[00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:05.210]  So, let's commence with the fight.
[00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.210]  Why don't we? Thank you.
[00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.210]  And you can see Professor Desmond,
[00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:11.210]  and she's just one of the members of the European Union Parliament up there,
[00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:13.210]  whether it's the EU Parliament.
[00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:16.210]  And believe me, this has got them scared,
[00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:20.210]  and patriots and constitutionalists and anti-globalists
[00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:24.210]  are getting elected all over the European Union right now.
[00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:28.210]  Now, listen, she was elected to the European Union Parliament,
[00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:30.210]  but that's only ceremonial.
[00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.210]  The EU was set up under a trade pact in 1947,
[00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.210]  then in 1956 they did the official deal,
[00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:38.210]  supposedly just as a corporate board.
[00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.210]  It's like the UN now is setting up treaties
[00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:42.210]  where they get the authority over medical care.
[00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:44.210]  Totally criminal, our government can't do it,
[00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:48.210]  but it's trying to through Biden and Obama that controls him.
[00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:50.210]  But it's the same thing here now,
[00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:53.210]  where the countries still have elected governments.
[00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:57.210]  And so, when she talked about France trying to take their rights away,
[00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.210]  she said a French minority.
[00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:03.210]  It is Macron right now, along with the German leader,
[00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:08.210]  the German Chancellor, that are pushing for EU veto power.
[00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:12.210]  EU veto power over nation states
[00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:18.210]  where they will now officially be under the EU board.
[00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:21.210]  So, the EU Parliament is ceremonial,
[00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:26.210]  and the EU governments themselves will now be ceremonial,
[00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:29.210]  and the EU will be a dictatorship.
[00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:33.210]  By the way, I have the head EU regulator here today.
[00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:35.210]  I am the regulator.
[00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:38.210]  EU Commissioner warns social media to censor after French riots,
[00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:40.210]  including in the United States,
[00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:43.210]  beyond what Biden is censoring right now,
[00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:45.210]  illegally through the FBI.
[00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:48.210]  So, again, we're under UN control.
[00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:50.210]  They're getting more and more control.
[00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:52.210]  EU, UN globalist control,
[00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:54.210]  because our government lets them do this
[00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:58.210]  and lets them sue and attack U.S. companies.
[00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:01.210]  So, because our government won't defend freedom of speech
[00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:02.210]  and, in fact, attacks it,
[00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:05.210]  and then it lets outside groups like the EU and UN
[00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:07.210]  that attack our companies.
[00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.210]  It's just incredible.
[00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:11.210]  We're going to go to break, start hour number two.
[00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:14.210]  So much to get to on the UN takeover,
[00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.210]  on the latest with RFK Jr.,
[00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:18.210]  your phone calls, Kamala Harris damage control,
[00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.210]  more on Trump.
[00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:23.210]  It's all coming up, jam-packed second hour.
[00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:28.210]  Please remember we have Patriot Pride Month going right now.
[00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:30.210]  We promote American values and freedom.
[00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:33.210]  Double Patriot points up to 60% off.
[00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:35.210]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:39.210]  And that sells only going until next week or so,
[00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:41.210]  because a lot of this stuff is selling out.
[00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:43.210]  10% off water filtration, all storable foods.
[00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.210]  That's a huge discount.
[00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:46.210]  Infowarsstore.com. We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:51.210]  With all the craziness in the world,
[00:57:51.210 --> 00:57:53.210]  the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:56.210]  the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:58.210]  the economy going crazy,
[00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:00.210]  you are crazy, in my view,
[00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.210]  if you don't get high-quality storable food
[00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:04.210]  and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:06.210]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:07.210]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:09.210]  and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:10.210]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:12.210]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.210]  but they don't have enough storable food
[00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:15.210]  or water filtration.
[00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:17.210]  This is something you need now.
[00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:19.210]  And we've got it in the food department
[00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:21.210]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:24.210]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration
[00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.210]  at the lowest prices you're going to find
[00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:27.210]  and still get quality.
[00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:30.210]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now
[00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:33.210]  for 10% off on all storable food
[00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:35.210]  and on water and air filtration.
[00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:38.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:39.210]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:42.210]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.210]  Go to infowarsstore.com and get prepared
[00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:46.210]  while you still can.
[00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:53.210]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:55.210]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:59.210]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:01.210]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:04.210]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:08.210]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.210]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:13.210]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:15.210]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:17.210]  it's really just incredible.
[00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:19.210]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:20.210]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:23.210]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:26.210]  Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:27.210]  I know you spread the word.
[00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:28.210]  I know you pray for us.
[00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:29.210]  And that's wonderful.
[00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.210]  Keep doing it.
[00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:33.210]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarsstore.com
[00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:35.210]  and you never buy great products
[00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:36.210]  that enrich and empower your life
[00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.210]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:40.210]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.210]  actually go buy products at infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:45.210]  If just 1% more of you took action
[00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.210]  and went to infowarsstore.com,
[00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:47.210]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:49.210]  Please take action now.
[00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:55.210]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:57.210]  you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.210]  All right, I'm going to hit all the news
[01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:04.210]  coming up next segment.
[01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:06.210]  But right now, let's show how you get in the face
[01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:09.210]  of these sickos coming after our kids.
[01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:12.210]  And then I break down dystopia with Christy Lee.
[01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:14.210]  And we'll be back with more of the live transmission.
[01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.210]  Stay with us.
[01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.210]  Oh, God.
[01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.210]  Excuse me.
[01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.210]  Sorry, excuse me.
[01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:24.210]  Excuse me.
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:25.210]  Sorry.
[01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:26.210]  Excuse me.
[01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.210]  We're going to do this.
[01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:28.210]  We're going to read the story.
[01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.210]  Please.
[01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.210]  This is morally wrong.
[01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.210]  This is a disgrace.
[01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.210]  This is morally wrong.
[01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.210]  Excuse me.
[01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:35.210]  Excuse me.
[01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.210]  Sorry.
[01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:37.210]  Excuse me.
[01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:38.210]  This is wrong.
[01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.210]  Drag queen story time for two.
[01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:41.210]  Reading stories to children.
[01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.210]  This is all wrong.
[01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:43.210]  Margot, can you not do that?
[01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.210]  Yeah.
[01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.210]  This is absolutely disgraceful.
[01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:50.210]  We have kids, men dressed as prostitutes,
[01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.210]  reading filth to children.
[01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.210]  What's this all about, lads?
[01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:55.210]  We can't.
[01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:56.210]  Hi, how's it going?
[01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:58.210]  Lads, we can't stand for this.
[01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:00.210]  Drag queen story time.
[01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:03.210]  People are giving out about it in America.
[01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:04.210]  It's not welcome in Ireland.
[01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.210]  Look at all these people here, lads.
[01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:08.210]  They're a protection of grooming.
[01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:10.210]  Right.
[01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:12.210]  We're not here to cause trouble.
[01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.210]  We're just trying to make people aware.
[01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.210]  This is a piece.
[01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.210]  Look at this, lads.
[01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.210]  All around.
[01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:19.210]  Look what they have.
[01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:22.210]  They're protecting grooming going on in Tralee.
[01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.210]  There's grooming going on in Tralee.
[01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:25.210]  No, I won't.
[01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:26.210]  This is a public library.
[01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:28.210]  We are members of the public.
[01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:29.210]  This is an event.
[01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:30.210]  This is an event.
[01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:31.210]  A children's event.
[01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:33.210]  Oh, don't be touching me.
[01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.210]  Hey, Steve, can you record this?
[01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.210]  Where are you?
[01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.210]  Steve, can you record this?
[01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:38.210]  Where are you, Steve?
[01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.210]  Why?
[01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.210]  Please.
[01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:41.210]  Give up.
[01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:42.210]  No, we're not going to.
[01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:43.210]  We have every right to be here.
[01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:44.210]  We've been asked to leave.
[01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:45.210]  We've been asked to leave.
[01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:47.210]  You can call the Gardaí all you want.
[01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:51.210]  What should be called in the Gardaí is this grooming going on for children.
[01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.210]  How dare they?
[01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:53.210]  This is grooming.
[01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.210]  Why do you have men dressed as women?
[01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.210]  They're not even dressed as women.
[01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:58.210]  They're dressed as prostitutes.
[01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.210]  Right?
[01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:01.210]  You don't need to be insulting to people.
[01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:02.210]  Excuse me.
[01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:04.210]  What's insulting is what you're doing to these kids here.
[01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:05.210]  Come on.
[01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:06.210]  Push me out now.
[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.210]  Push me out.
[01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:08.210]  Push me out.
[01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:09.210]  Come on.
[01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:10.210]  Push me out.
[01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.210]  They're trying to manhandle me.
[01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.210]  But good luck to that.
[01:02:12.210 --> 01:02:13.210]  Good luck to that.
[01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.210]  Here we are, lads.
[01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:15.210]  All right.
[01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:16.210]  If you put that on my face, I'm going to have to protect myself.
[01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.210]  All right?
[01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.210]  Because this umbrella, you disgust me.
[01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:19.210]  You disgust me.
[01:02:19.210 --> 01:02:20.210]  You disgust me.
[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.210]  Now, I want to be a proper woman here.
[01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.210]  What you're doing, you should be protecting children, not teaching them this filth.
[01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:23.210]  All right?
[01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:25.210]  words of their plan.
[01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:26.210]  So, you have to just come to grips with the fact that this is really their plan.
[01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:27.210]  And so, they said five years ago, by 2023, you'll be eating bugs.
[01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.210]  Public school systems all over the world are making kids eat bugs right now.
[01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.210]  And they're putting bug protein in the food, which is highly toxic with the keratin.
[01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:30.210]  And so, you have to just come to grips with the fact that this is really their plan.
[01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:31.210]  And so, you have to just come to grips with the fact that this is really their plan.
[01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:32.210]  And so, they said five years ago, by 2023, you'll be eating bugs.
[01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.210]  Public school systems all over the world are making kids eat bugs right now.
[01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:34.210]  And they're putting bug protein in the food, which is highly toxic with the keratin.
[01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.210]  And so, you have to just come to grips with the fact that this is really their plan.
[01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.210]  And so, you have to just come to grips with the fact that this is really their plan.

[01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:53.970]  And so, I would just tell people, the reason I don't like things like the Q thing is it's
[01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:59.090]  esoteric, people think it's like a magic thing they're involved in and they see all these
[01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:00.550]  signs and things.
[01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:02.370]  You can go read the Club of Rome.
[01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:03.730]  You can go read the Trilateral Commission.
[01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:05.090]  You can go read the CFR.
[01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:14.370]  You can go to the Austin Middle School where they have gender queer that your children
[01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:18.850]  saw in the library where they show adults having sex with children.
[01:04:18.850 --> 01:04:19.850]  It's all around us.
[01:04:19.850 --> 01:04:21.970]  It's not like some esoteric hidden code.
[01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:23.410]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:29.170]  I grew up watching commercials for like Sprite, everything else, where they would go, it's
[01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:33.730]  delicious or Chef Boyardee would go, delicious food.
[01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:37.090]  Everybody always jokes I must be secretly part Italian.
[01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:39.090]  I'm not because I wave my arms around so much.
[01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:41.490]  There's a whole thing online and it doesn't bother me.
[01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:45.890]  It doesn't hurt me, but it's sad for them where they're like, look, Jones did this.
[01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:47.970]  Look, it's an Illuminati sign.
[01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:52.210]  No, this means in almost every culture, like this is really important.
[01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.690]  This doesn't mean 666, folks.
[01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:57.490]  God gave me these.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.720]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.720]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.720]  They have a lot of power.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.720]  But they can be defeated.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.720]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.720]  But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body and your family's body
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.720]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.720]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.720]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.720]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.720]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.720]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.720]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.720]  For a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.720]  Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.720]  In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.720]  Get it today and it funds the Infowar.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.720]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.720]  with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.720]  In some cases, they add to the water supply like fluoride.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.720]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.720]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.720]  Now into hour number two.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.720]  I intend to open the phones up.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:41.720]  At the end of the segment, I'll give the toll-free number out to take your calls on this live Monday, July 17, 2023 transmission.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720]  All right.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:46.720]  I started talking about central bank digital currencies 10 years ago or so.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.720]  You can pull up the articles at Infowars.com.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:55.720]  We were basically the first to reading UN documents and what they were planning, like replacement migration, all the things we've now seen.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.720]  So people ask, how were you way ahead of the curve?
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.720]  Well, we know the globalists do run the show.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.720]  They're trying to get full control, but they've got control over global policy.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.720]  And so what they're trying to set up, they're not playing games with.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]  I know it sounds crazy.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.720]  They're going to shut down the majority of farms.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.720]  Now they're doing it all over the world.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720]  It sounds crazy.
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.720]  They're going to have pedophiles dressed as prostitutes shaking their ass in front of two-year-olds.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.720]  They're doing it.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:20.720]  It sounds crazy.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.720]  They're going to ship in enough fentanyl to kill hundreds of thousands a year and totally dissolve the border and allow human trafficking.
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.720]  They're doing it.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.720]  It sounds crazy.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:31.720]  They're going to overthrow the Ukrainian government, install a dictator, and start a war with Russia.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:32.720]  They did it.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:33.720]  It sounds crazy.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.720]  They're going to release a virus and then blame it on the jungle and try to lock us down in our houses and give us poison shots.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.720]  They did it.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.720]  And so I started reading about central bank digital currencies, programmable money more than a decade ago.
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.720]  But they started rolling out the plans for it about 2012 or so.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720]  And so we covered it and warned people and went over it.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:59.720]  Then they created the ESGs that are the corporate rating structure for businesses.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:08.720]  So instead of getting you to have the corporate carbon tax and social credit score like China already has going back at least six years it's been in place,
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:14.720]  they get the corporations to sign on and then the central banks, the Rothschilds control most of them,
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.719]  that just create money out of thin air will give them unlimited money.
[01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:22.719]  It doesn't matter if Anheuser-Busch loses $30 billion, we'll just give you $30 billion more or $100 billion.
[01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:25.719]  It doesn't matter if Hollywood's bankrupt, we'll just keep funding you.
[01:08:25.719 --> 01:08:28.719]  So they have unlimited.
[01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:34.719]  And there's the Economist magazine owned by the Rothschilds telling you about get ready for the one world currency.
[01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.719]  So they're telling you about their system.
[01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:41.719]  And under it they will control what you can buy, what you can sell, where you can go, where the money can be spent.
[01:08:41.719 --> 01:08:44.719]  This has all been admitted. I've played clips of them admitting it.
[01:08:44.719 --> 01:08:50.719]  So BlackRock, which is the biggest consortium in the world of investment funds,
[01:08:50.719 --> 01:08:58.719]  both government and private and individual, corporate, came out with hundreds of trillions under management conservatively
[01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:03.719]  and said a couple of years ago we're going to control behavior, we're going to run your life.
[01:09:03.719 --> 01:09:06.719]  Those are quotes from Larry Fink.
[01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:09.719]  In fact, I don't want to just say that. Find a clip of Larry Fink. He says it a bunch.
[01:09:09.719 --> 01:09:11.719]  Just type it into Twitter.
[01:09:11.719 --> 01:09:15.719]  Head of BlackRock says we're going to control your behavior with ESGs.
[01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:22.719]  And so all these legislatures, really just a few at first, Louisiana and a few others,
[01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:28.719]  first last year said okay, we're going to cut state pension funds out of your investments when you do this.
[01:09:29.719 --> 01:09:31.719]  That caused a bunch of other governments to do it.
[01:09:31.719 --> 01:09:38.719]  And Larry Fink pulled back and went whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, we won't do it now.
[01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:40.719]  We're going to call it something else.
[01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:48.719]  Then he kamikazed Target and North Face and Anheuser-Busch that they own.
[01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:51.719]  They own the majority of it.
[01:09:51.719 --> 01:10:00.719]  They kamikazed those into conservatives and people trying to train us to just get used to the insanity.
[01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:06.719]  I mean if you'll accept convicted pedophiles dressed like prostitutes shaking their peckers in front of little kids' faces,
[01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:09.719]  you'll accept eating bugs.
[01:10:09.719 --> 01:10:11.719]  And so they're using psychology.
[01:10:11.719 --> 01:10:17.719]  But if you just realize it's psychology, don't buy any of it, and put out the opposite information, you beat them.
[01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:21.719]  But they think you're dumb animals that can't get your mind around this.
[01:10:21.719 --> 01:10:26.719]  So Larry Fink that launched the ESGs, just five years ago we talked about ESGs,
[01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:29.719]  New York Times said we were insane, it didn't exist.
[01:10:29.719 --> 01:10:35.719]  Five years later, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says he's officially retiring ESGs as an investing term.
[01:10:40.719 --> 01:10:43.719]  Because it's become an official thing of the anti-woke crowd.
[01:10:43.719 --> 01:10:45.719]  No, we know it's you trying to control our lives.
[01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:48.719]  Here he is saying it's about controlling us, here it is.
[01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:52.719]  Behaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we're asking companies.
[01:10:52.719 --> 01:10:58.719]  You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock we are forcing behaviors.
[01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:01.719]  There you go, there's the quote.
[01:11:01.719 --> 01:11:04.719]  So now they're changing the name to ESGs.
[01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:07.719]  But let's talk about the ESG structure.
[01:11:07.719 --> 01:11:12.719]  They started developing social credit score plans 30 years ago, MIT and others.
[01:11:13.719 --> 01:11:18.719]  And when they censor you or go after you, those are forms of social credit score.
[01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:21.719]  When you get debanked, that's a form of social credit score.
[01:11:21.719 --> 01:11:24.719]  When they call you a Nazi because you don't support a real Nazi collaborator,
[01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:26.719]  George Soros, that's social credit score.
[01:11:26.719 --> 01:11:31.719]  But they want a unified system that tracks and controls every facet of your life.
[01:11:31.719 --> 01:11:35.719]  And if you don't behave yourself, China already has it in place again for at least six years,
[01:11:35.719 --> 01:11:39.719]  where if you do anything they don't like, your car won't start, you can't go to work,
[01:11:39.719 --> 01:11:42.719]  you can't get a plane ticket, you can't get a hotel, you can't get insurance,
[01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:44.719]  and they take your house away from you.
[01:11:44.719 --> 01:11:46.719]  And then when you're homeless, that's basically illegal in China,
[01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:49.719]  they take you to forced labor camp.
[01:11:49.719 --> 01:11:52.719]  So that's currently going on in China, for those that don't know,
[01:11:52.719 --> 01:11:55.719]  who've been hiding under a rock.
[01:11:55.719 --> 01:11:59.719]  But what controls the ESG?
[01:11:59.719 --> 01:12:02.719]  Well, that's the SDGs.
[01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:05.719]  Remember that clip two years ago when Trudeau in Canada said,
[01:12:05.719 --> 01:12:13.719]  COVID's a great opportunity to enforce the SDGs and the ESGs.
[01:12:13.719 --> 01:12:21.719]  So when you hear SDG, that is the Sustainable Development Goals.
[01:12:21.719 --> 01:12:28.719]  So the UN and its corporate masters on the medical side, Bill Gates and Peter Daszak and Fauci,
[01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:31.719]  but JPMorgan Chase, you know, the Rothschilds on finances,
[01:12:31.719 --> 01:12:36.719]  when you want to know at every level, the bureaucracies of the global corporations,
[01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:42.719]  they come, they write the policies as what? NGOs.
[01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:47.719]  So the NGOs finance the UN, they founded the UN, the Rockefellers did in 1946,
[01:12:47.719 --> 01:12:55.719]  Presidio, Naval Base, San Francisco, California.
[01:12:55.719 --> 01:13:00.719]  So the NGOs control the UN.
[01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:06.719]  And the UN then comes out with the policies that they write for the SDGs.
[01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:10.719]  And the SDGs are, again, the Sustainable Development Goals,
[01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:14.719]  which are then enforced through the ESGs.
[01:13:14.719 --> 01:13:20.719]  Those are the corporate systems enforced by the central banks and the scoring system.
[01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:30.719]  And then they deploy the social credit score, or the different systems they develop
[01:13:30.719 --> 01:13:36.719]  under other names are the same thing, against you individually.
[01:13:36.719 --> 01:13:43.719]  So the NGOs control the SDGs, they create the format for that,
[01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:48.719]  and then the UN SDGs enforce the ESGs.
[01:13:48.719 --> 01:13:53.719]  So they're not getting rid of the ESGs, they're simply changing the name
[01:13:53.719 --> 01:13:56.719]  because you've now learned of it.
[01:13:56.719 --> 01:13:58.719]  And they've got some new names and some new ideas,
[01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:00.719]  but the corporations are still going ahead with this,
[01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:03.719]  and there's even articles where big corporations are asking,
[01:14:03.719 --> 01:14:07.719]  okay, if we're all supposed to have electric cars, or we're all supposed to promote pedophilia,
[01:14:07.719 --> 01:14:11.719]  we're all supposed to promote sexualization of children, how do we score?
[01:14:11.719 --> 01:14:15.719]  And they've actually said, we're watching you, we still have the scoring system,
[01:14:15.719 --> 01:14:18.719]  and we're going to give you a new system soon so you can file your reports with us.
[01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:23.719]  So this is the UN controlled by megacorporations and megabanks that are totally ruthless
[01:14:23.719 --> 01:14:26.719]  and out of control, who want to vertically integrate the economy,
[01:14:26.719 --> 01:14:29.719]  who just put us through years of lockdowns and destroyed the third world
[01:14:29.719 --> 01:14:33.719]  and killed 50, 60 million people in starvation extra,
[01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:38.719]  literally saying we're going to control your domestic security score,
[01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:42.719]  your individual social credit score, through the UN,
[01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:46.719]  which is already standardized with Bill Gates and the WHO,
[01:14:46.719 --> 01:14:50.719]  the Worldwide Vaccine Passport System.
[01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:54.719]  So here is UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez saying they have,
[01:14:54.719 --> 01:14:57.719]  skip the break, we have less than 10 years,
[01:14:57.719 --> 01:15:00.719]  so UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez saying,
[01:15:00.719 --> 01:15:04.719]  we have less than 10 years to solve the UN, SDG, and AI,
[01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:09.719]  holds great promise to advance the 17 sustainable development goals and targets,
[01:15:09.719 --> 01:15:13.719]  together we can use artificial intelligence to enhance human dignity
[01:15:13.719 --> 01:15:16.719]  and serve the global good.
[01:15:16.719 --> 01:15:19.719]  And the global good means cutting off your resources, you own nothing,
[01:15:19.719 --> 01:15:22.719]  you have nothing, and a supercomputer in Brussels called the Beast,
[01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:26.719]  that's its name, updated since then.
[01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:29.719]  Look it up for yourself, I'm not making this up.
[01:15:29.719 --> 01:15:32.719]  They turned the Beast on in 1981.
[01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:34.719]  That's type in Beast Computer, Brussels, Belgium,
[01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:36.719]  at the International Bank of Settlements.
[01:15:36.719 --> 01:15:38.719]  And I played you the International Bank of Settlements head saying,
[01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:41.719]  we'll program all your money and have full control soon.
[01:15:41.719 --> 01:15:43.719]  I played that last week.
[01:15:43.719 --> 01:15:45.719]  In fact, cue that back up too, we'll play that too.
[01:15:45.719 --> 01:15:47.719]  So an average talk show host would get up here and say,
[01:15:47.719 --> 01:15:51.719]  the UN is going to have AI control your social credit score.
[01:15:51.719 --> 01:15:54.719]  That's how a normal talk show host does it.
[01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:56.719]  I don't plan things, I don't do it on purpose, I'm different.
[01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.719]  I just give you the history, the background, what's going on,
[01:15:58.719 --> 01:16:02.719]  and then tell you the new development, which has been the original development.
[01:16:02.719 --> 01:16:05.719]  So it's not just the UN's going to run your life and control your life
[01:16:05.719 --> 01:16:07.719]  and cut your resources off, in their own report,
[01:16:07.719 --> 01:16:12.719]  cutting 50% off of resources, not just energy, by 2030.
[01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:16.719]  You understand a 10% cut in resources will kill 100 million people or more.
[01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:19.719]  A 20%, a billion. I mean, I've seen the numbers.
[01:16:19.719 --> 01:16:23.719]  A 50% civilization total collapse, which is what they want.
[01:16:23.719 --> 01:16:28.719]  So an unelected UN, controlled and financed by ruthless mega banks,
[01:16:28.719 --> 01:16:32.719]  with Larry Fink literally at the head of it,
[01:16:32.719 --> 01:16:35.719]  saying we're going to control your life,
[01:16:35.719 --> 01:16:41.719]  is going to use AI computers to manage and track everything you're doing
[01:16:41.719 --> 01:16:44.719]  to regulate and tax and score you for this system.
[01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:47.719]  Now obviously we knew it would always be a supercomputer doing it.
[01:16:47.719 --> 01:16:54.719]  But they're saying centralized UN corporate programmed control system
[01:16:54.719 --> 01:16:58.719]  that is designed to slowly incrementally train you,
[01:16:59.719 --> 01:17:02.719]  that if you submit at first, and here's the key,
[01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:05.719]  to the first levels of the ESG, chop your son's genitals off,
[01:17:05.719 --> 01:17:07.719]  you go up in the score, literally.
[01:17:07.719 --> 01:17:10.719]  Get an electric car, know it's super toxic and bad, score goes up.
[01:17:10.719 --> 01:17:13.719]  Sell your farm to the globalists, score goes way up.
[01:17:13.719 --> 01:17:20.719]  Put on an LGBTPS event, ESG goes up.
[01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:23.719]  Decide to go ahead and sign a document that you're going to euthanize yourself
[01:17:23.719 --> 01:17:27.719]  in five years to save the earth, ESG explodes.
[01:17:28.719 --> 01:17:34.719]  And then once they get enough people doing that in the ESG,
[01:17:34.719 --> 01:17:37.719]  then they can add more and more and more and more and more and more
[01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.719]  onto what you've got to submit to in the ESG.
[01:17:40.719 --> 01:17:44.719]  And so people think they're getting ahead by submitting to the ESG,
[01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:46.719]  but if they look back, they're going to lose resources
[01:17:46.719 --> 01:17:48.719]  even if they fully submit to the ESG.
[01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:50.719]  But they're going to think like a game they're winning
[01:17:50.719 --> 01:17:52.719]  and getting ahead of everybody else.
[01:17:52.719 --> 01:17:54.719]  So because they see other people homeless,
[01:17:54.719 --> 01:17:55.719]  other people not able to go to the movies,
[01:17:55.719 --> 01:17:59.719]  other people not able to get medicine, other people unable to get education,
[01:17:59.719 --> 01:18:02.719]  not able to go buy clothes or go on a trip,
[01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:04.719]  even though they're all confined too and bowing down perfectly
[01:18:04.719 --> 01:18:07.719]  and behaving and striving to serve the system,
[01:18:07.719 --> 01:18:11.719]  they'll be able to look down on the new giant underclass and feel powerful.
[01:18:11.719 --> 01:18:14.719]  So even though they're sinking in quicksand,
[01:18:14.719 --> 01:18:17.719]  because they get to see other people swallowed up before them
[01:18:17.719 --> 01:18:20.719]  and because they're only thinking five minutes ahead,
[01:18:20.719 --> 01:18:22.719]  low attention spans programmed into them,
[01:18:22.719 --> 01:18:25.719]  they will submit to the ESG rollout,
[01:18:25.719 --> 01:18:27.719]  believing they're getting ahead instead of getting behind,
[01:18:27.719 --> 01:18:30.719]  and then by the time they've already shut down enough of the infrastructure,
[01:18:30.719 --> 01:18:32.719]  there'll be no hope for them,
[01:18:32.719 --> 01:18:35.719]  and they'll have to do more and more prostrating themselves
[01:18:35.719 --> 01:18:38.719]  and laying on their bellies before the system
[01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:42.719]  to be able to even keep any basic ESG status.
[01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:46.719]  And finally, you'll have to agree to a set date to be sterilized at first.
[01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:51.719]  That'll get you a whole bunch of, that'll get you five years of ESG credits at first.
[01:18:51.719 --> 01:18:55.719]  You'll be able to fly around the world, go to Australia, go to Tokyo,
[01:18:55.719 --> 01:18:58.719]  stay in five-star hotels, everything for five years.
[01:18:58.719 --> 01:19:01.719]  Then you're sterilized, and that's for the first few years.
[01:19:01.719 --> 01:19:04.719]  And then it's like, well, I'm opting to be euthanized in five years.
[01:19:04.719 --> 01:19:07.719]  You'll be a hero. You'll be on national TV at first.
[01:19:07.719 --> 01:19:10.719]  The first guy to do it will be, then it'll be millions.
[01:19:10.719 --> 01:19:12.719]  And then it's, well, actually your ESG score's so low,
[01:19:12.719 --> 01:19:16.719]  we're refusing you all services, you're paralyzed, and you just die.
[01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:18.719]  That's already in Canada.
[01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:22.719]  And they come and say, sorry, no services, kill yourself.
[01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:25.719]  And so imagine the fools wearing their black Antifa outfits
[01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:28.719]  and going to the communist meetings, being programmed by BlackRock,
[01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:36.719]  being programmed by King Charles, being programmed by Larry Page and Eric Schmidt,
[01:19:36.719 --> 01:19:39.719]  and literally have built this.
[01:19:39.719 --> 01:19:42.719]  What I just told you is exactly what's going to happen.
[01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:45.719]  That's the admitted plan.
[01:19:45.719 --> 01:19:50.719]  And the average leftist is chomping at the bit to have a carbon score.
[01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:53.719]  They already have all these little private corporate apps they have
[01:19:53.719 --> 01:19:55.719]  where they put stickers on their cars and they have them,
[01:19:55.719 --> 01:19:57.719]  and they go to restaurants and go, oh, I'm going to test my carbon.
[01:19:57.719 --> 01:20:00.719]  They go, oh, good job, thank you.
[01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:04.719]  I'll never forget, like, 15 years ago,
[01:20:04.719 --> 01:20:08.719]  I was being flown out to Los Angeles to be on a television show,
[01:20:08.719 --> 01:20:12.719]  and I had a pretty big movie producer who wanted me to be in a movie
[01:20:12.719 --> 01:20:16.719]  that I ended up not doing because I just got done with Hollywood at that point.
[01:20:16.719 --> 01:20:22.719]  And he pulls up at the hotel, we eat dinner,
[01:20:22.719 --> 01:20:24.719]  and then later I was like, whose car do you want to take to go to this meeting?
[01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.719]  Oh, let's take mine.
[01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:29.719]  So they just come out with hybrid cars.
[01:20:29.719 --> 01:20:31.719]  It was this little Ford truck of some type.
[01:20:31.719 --> 01:20:34.719]  That's all they had at the place when I got there.
[01:20:34.719 --> 01:20:36.719]  For some reason, they didn't have the car I wanted.
[01:20:36.719 --> 01:20:39.719]  And he just goes, oh, Alex, you're so good.
[01:20:39.719 --> 01:20:42.719]  I'm so impressed by you.
[01:20:42.719 --> 01:20:46.719]  I'm so impressed by you that you have a hybrid car.
[01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:47.719]  You really care.
[01:20:47.719 --> 01:20:49.719]  He was, like, patting me like I was a baby,
[01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:51.719]  nudging me and telling me I was good.
[01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:55.719]  And then a year or so later, he was at my office,
[01:20:55.719 --> 01:20:57.719]  because he also lived in an office, nice guy,
[01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:03.719]  and he saw that in one of the offices we had the new LED light bulbs.
[01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:06.719]  He goes, oh, you're doing it for the earth.
[01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:09.719]  See, you are a liberal.
[01:21:09.719 --> 01:21:12.719]  That's what this is all about is a cult, folks.
[01:21:12.719 --> 01:21:16.719]  Well, they have giant lithium mines and just total toxic waste and GMO everywhere
[01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:20.719]  and toxic waste dumping in and they're frying the atmosphere in 5G
[01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:24.719]  and the bugs are all dying.
[01:21:24.719 --> 01:21:28.719]  But they're so good.
[01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:29.719]  So that's what they do.
[01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:32.719]  They submit early on and they think they're winning.
[01:21:32.719 --> 01:21:38.719]  But let me just give you a very simple analysis of this.
[01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:40.719]  And you can go into their battle plans, their numbers,
[01:21:40.719 --> 01:21:42.719]  and actually state all of this.
[01:21:42.719 --> 01:21:46.719]  This is how once they get you addicted to the ESG and the SDGs
[01:21:46.719 --> 01:21:52.719]  and all the rest of these, let's say under a maximized free market laissez-faire system,
[01:21:52.719 --> 01:21:57.719]  this would be the amount of resources the average person would be getting in a year.
[01:21:58.719 --> 01:22:01.719]  Now they start cutting off the resources,
[01:22:01.719 --> 01:22:04.719]  telling you you're going to go to electric cars and a replacement
[01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:08.719]  that they say is a bridge to the future.
[01:22:08.719 --> 01:22:10.719]  And they sell it like it's a bridge to the future.
[01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:13.719]  Oh, we're just replacing these bad things and we're just going to the new thing
[01:22:13.719 --> 01:22:15.719]  and the backwards travel that I just don't want.
[01:22:15.719 --> 01:22:17.719]  So you're thinking, oh, I'm just going to this new thing.
[01:22:17.719 --> 01:22:18.719]  No, no, no.
[01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:20.719]  What happens is the electric cars and all the systems,
[01:22:20.719 --> 01:22:23.719]  the shutdown of the power plants won't even produce power for the electric cars.
[01:22:23.719 --> 01:22:25.719]  It's a bridge to nowhere as they break down society,
[01:22:25.719 --> 01:22:28.719]  but they also own the electric car companies make money while they scam you.
[01:22:28.719 --> 01:22:30.719]  So you actually go down here.
[01:22:30.719 --> 01:22:32.719]  So here you are in 2023.
[01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:34.719]  Here you are in 2025.
[01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:40.719]  And they talk about 50% reduction in energy and consumption by 2030.
[01:22:40.719 --> 01:22:43.719]  I mean, if they actually do that, folks, we're talking 5 billion dead,
[01:22:43.719 --> 01:22:45.719]  3 billion dead conservatively.
[01:22:45.719 --> 01:22:46.719]  Okay?
[01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:48.719]  This is just totally insane.
[01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:52.719]  But the average person, let me show you another analogy here.
[01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:54.719]  These aren't exact numbers.
[01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:55.719]  This is just a basic thing.
[01:22:55.719 --> 01:23:02.719]  A person in the year 2023 has this much resources from their job
[01:23:02.719 --> 01:23:05.719]  and where you live and what you do, and this is how much your money can buy.
[01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:10.719]  Housing, food, entertainment, transportation, medicine, it's all here.
[01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:12.719]  Now, they tell the left, hey, and they have startup companies.
[01:23:12.719 --> 01:23:14.719]  They hire them because they are leftist.
[01:23:14.719 --> 01:23:17.719]  Hey, you can boost your income and stuff if you join us.
[01:23:17.719 --> 01:23:21.719]  And at first, in 2024, you might even increase it
[01:23:21.719 --> 01:23:23.719]  because you went along with what they wanted.
[01:23:23.719 --> 01:23:24.719]  So you go up.
[01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:28.719]  But then as the rest of the economy implodes because of this predatory system,
[01:23:28.719 --> 01:23:31.719]  you're now here, and in 2025, you're actually here.
[01:23:31.719 --> 01:23:33.719]  See how it works?
[01:23:33.719 --> 01:23:35.719]  Now, the rest of the public, because you're part of the in crowd,
[01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:37.719]  they've been down here the whole time.
[01:23:37.719 --> 01:23:41.719]  But now as this goes down, now they've imploded the third world
[01:23:41.719 --> 01:23:44.719]  and the working class, and they've got nothing.
[01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:45.719]  They're down here.
[01:23:45.719 --> 01:23:46.719]  You're now down here.
[01:23:46.719 --> 01:23:47.719]  See?
[01:23:47.719 --> 01:23:50.719]  But you still get to look down on them so you feel powerful.
[01:23:50.719 --> 01:23:53.719]  When they're dying, well, you're now barely having enough food to eat,
[01:23:53.719 --> 01:23:54.719]  but it's okay.
[01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:56.719]  You're still trained on the phone, trained on the ESG,
[01:23:56.719 --> 01:23:59.719]  trained on the social credit score right down until your own death.
[01:23:59.719 --> 01:24:01.719]  You see how that works?
[01:24:01.719 --> 01:24:02.719]  So you opt into this.
[01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:05.719]  Oh, just take the shot, and you'll be able to go back to normal.
[01:24:05.719 --> 01:24:07.719]  Oh, sorry, can't go back to normal.
[01:24:07.719 --> 01:24:08.719]  Take five more.
[01:24:08.719 --> 01:24:10.719]  And if you'd have kept buying it, it would have never ended.
[01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:15.719]  It was all to see how stupid you'd be and to then mark who will be gullible
[01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:19.719]  who will believe what we say in the future when we put a carrot out
[01:24:19.719 --> 01:24:20.719]  but keep withdrawing it.
[01:24:20.719 --> 01:24:22.719]  It's all psychological warfare.
[01:24:22.719 --> 01:24:25.719]  And you can realize you're being conned, admit you're being conned,
[01:24:25.719 --> 01:24:32.719]  do something about being conned, or you can continue to be a fool.
[01:24:32.719 --> 01:24:40.719]  But this leads us to, in 2030, post-industrial world.
[01:24:40.719 --> 01:24:41.719]  I'm going to explain it again.
[01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:43.719]  And I'm going to show the UN document we showed on Friday,
[01:24:43.719 --> 01:24:50.719]  a 50% reduction in consuming across the board, clothing, transportation,
[01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:55.719]  medicine, housing, travel, everything.
[01:24:55.719 --> 01:25:02.719]  In the world, around 5 billion people, that's a billion,
[01:25:02.719 --> 01:25:06.719]  live with less than 5% discretionary income.
[01:25:06.719 --> 01:25:10.719]  About 3 billion live on the edge of starvation,
[01:25:10.719 --> 01:25:13.719]  and a billion are in the process of starvation.
[01:25:13.719 --> 01:25:15.719]  Now, I'm going to explain this again to all the liberals.
[01:25:15.719 --> 01:25:16.719]  You want mass death.
[01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:17.719]  You want abortion.
[01:25:17.719 --> 01:25:19.719]  You want to chop a boy's genitals off.
[01:25:19.719 --> 01:25:20.719]  You're on the inside crew.
[01:25:20.719 --> 01:25:22.719]  You know what's about the population.
[01:25:22.719 --> 01:25:23.719]  You're going to get more resources.
[01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:27.719]  I mean, I know a lot of you are read into this, and you like it.
[01:25:27.719 --> 01:25:28.719]  You think it's cool.
[01:25:28.719 --> 01:25:30.719]  Look at yourself in the mirror.
[01:25:30.719 --> 01:25:32.719]  Look at what you have.
[01:25:32.719 --> 01:25:33.719]  Look at who you're around.
[01:25:33.719 --> 01:25:34.719]  You're with the losers.
[01:25:34.719 --> 01:25:36.719]  The globalists actually have you right where they want you.
[01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:39.719]  You're the first group they're getting rid of.
[01:25:39.719 --> 01:25:42.719]  If this whole thing even sails through, I'll be able to snap my fingers
[01:25:42.719 --> 01:25:44.719]  and join the new world order.
[01:25:44.719 --> 01:25:46.719]  I'm not going to do it because God will destroy me,
[01:25:46.719 --> 01:25:49.719]  and I don't want to be around these people because I'm respected
[01:25:49.719 --> 01:25:50.719]  because I battle them.
[01:25:50.719 --> 01:25:51.719]  I know how they operate.
[01:25:51.719 --> 01:25:53.719]  I study their operations better than they do, most of their people.
[01:25:53.719 --> 01:25:55.719]  Most of their top people are too lazy.
[01:25:55.719 --> 01:25:58.719]  They just follow the directives, try to get the best job done in their area,
[01:25:58.719 --> 01:25:59.719]  and then party all the time.
[01:25:59.719 --> 01:26:00.719]  I don't do that.
[01:26:00.719 --> 01:26:01.719]  I battle constantly.
[01:26:01.719 --> 01:26:03.719]  I'm against them.
[01:26:03.719 --> 01:26:06.719]  But the average leftist thinks they're in some super guild,
[01:26:06.719 --> 01:26:08.719]  or they're in some wonderful Star Trek future,
[01:26:08.719 --> 01:26:11.719]  and they're having to tear everything up now to build the utopia.
[01:26:11.719 --> 01:26:14.719]  No, Jack, you better read deeper into your bosses' plans.
[01:26:14.719 --> 01:26:18.719]  They plan to get rid of 99% of people, not 90.
[01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:21.719]  You really think your bosses are going to kill 90% of people
[01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:23.719]  by cutting their resources off incrementally
[01:26:23.719 --> 01:26:26.719]  and making us fight over what's left against each other
[01:26:26.719 --> 01:26:27.719]  as it goes down to zero,
[01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:33.719]  and then leave you around once they've wiped out 90%?
[01:26:33.719 --> 01:26:38.719]  In fact, they plan to get rid of you way before it even gets to the 90%.
[01:26:38.719 --> 01:26:44.719]  You're the first people, traitors, liars, easily manipulated.
[01:26:44.719 --> 01:26:47.719]  You'll lower the drawbridge on your own people, the outside enemy.
[01:26:47.719 --> 01:26:51.719]  You guys will not go across the River Jordan in the Promised Land.
[01:26:51.719 --> 01:26:54.719]  You are not going to make it.
[01:26:54.719 --> 01:26:57.719]  And your god's a false god, and your promise is a false promise.
[01:26:57.719 --> 01:27:00.719]  And the desert you're in is the desert of destruction,
[01:27:00.719 --> 01:27:02.719]  and you're never going to come out of it.
[01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:04.719]  So first, let's get that straight.
[01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:07.719]  They say that they may keep 1% of us alive.
[01:27:07.719 --> 01:27:12.719]  There could be two globalists left, and they would kill each other.
[01:27:12.719 --> 01:27:15.719]  That's the nature of these Satanists.
[01:27:15.719 --> 01:27:18.719]  So the whole thing is a lie.
[01:27:18.719 --> 01:27:20.719]  The whole thing is a fraud, and here's the deal.
[01:27:20.719 --> 01:27:22.719]  I'm not going to try to wake up the left.
[01:27:22.719 --> 01:27:26.719]  I'm not going to try to educate them because, on average, they have a spirit.
[01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:27.719]  They're very dumbed down.
[01:27:27.719 --> 01:27:28.719]  They're very toxic.
[01:27:28.719 --> 01:27:29.719]  They're very poisonous.
[01:27:29.719 --> 01:27:30.719]  They're too far gone.
[01:27:30.719 --> 01:27:33.719]  But I want everybody else that's kind of going along to get along,
[01:27:33.719 --> 01:27:35.719]  that thinks you get ahead by complying,
[01:27:35.719 --> 01:27:38.719]  to understand you don't want to be signed on with these people
[01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:40.719]  because this is where the losers are going.
[01:27:40.719 --> 01:27:43.719]  The future is in recognizing this, understanding it,
[01:27:43.719 --> 01:27:46.719]  and building new systems of real sustainability.
[01:27:46.719 --> 01:27:50.719]  When you hear sustainability, that means non-sustainability collapse.
[01:27:51.719 --> 01:27:55.719]  That means reset, build back better on our ashes.
[01:27:55.719 --> 01:28:01.719]  A post-industrial, post-carbon planet that's synthetic and that is silicon.
[01:28:01.719 --> 01:28:04.719]  This is not just a takeover of the humans.
[01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:05.719]  I've studied it.
[01:28:05.719 --> 01:28:06.719]  Look at it.
[01:28:06.719 --> 01:28:09.719]  It's an anti-carbon-based life-form operation.
[01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:13.719]  That's why the analysis is it's an off-world group.
[01:28:13.719 --> 01:28:16.719]  I sit around with, like, two-star generals and stuff, and they agree.
[01:28:17.719 --> 01:28:19.719]  This is known.
[01:28:19.719 --> 01:28:23.719]  This is not human, and you can play games all day with this,
[01:28:23.719 --> 01:28:27.719]  but you need to understand don't be a collaborator against your own species.
[01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:29.719]  Don't be a fool.
[01:28:29.719 --> 01:28:33.719]  I'll play the clip on the UN control through SDGs
[01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:37.719]  and that the ESGs have gone nowhere, but we've got them on the rocks.
[01:28:37.719 --> 01:28:39.719]  We come back, and I'll give the toll-free number.
[01:28:39.719 --> 01:28:40.719]  I'll do it now.
[01:28:40.719 --> 01:28:47.719]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:28:47.719 --> 01:28:51.719]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:28:51.719 --> 01:28:52.719]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:52.719 --> 01:28:53.719]  Stay with us.
[01:28:53.719 --> 01:28:54.719]  Band.Video.
[01:28:58.719 --> 01:29:01.719]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[01:29:01.719 --> 01:29:05.719]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:29:05.719 --> 01:29:07.719]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[01:29:07.719 --> 01:29:11.719]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:29:11.719 --> 01:29:14.719]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:29:14.719 --> 01:29:18.719]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[01:29:18.719 --> 01:29:23.719]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:29:23.719 --> 01:29:24.719]  Look it up.
[01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:26.719]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:29:26.719 --> 01:29:29.719]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there,
[01:29:29.719 --> 01:29:32.719]  highest rated at half the price of leading competitors,

[01:29:35.719 --> 01:29:37.719]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:29:37.719 --> 01:29:39.719]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:29:39.719 --> 01:29:40.719]  It is amazing.
[01:29:40.719 --> 01:29:42.719]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:29:42.719 --> 01:29:45.719]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:29:45.719 --> 01:29:46.719]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:29:46.719 --> 01:29:50.719]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[01:29:55.719 --> 01:29:57.719]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:29:57.719 --> 01:29:58.719]  You need this filter.
[01:29:58.719 --> 01:30:01.719]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots
[01:30:01.719 --> 01:30:04.719]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:06.719]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[01:30:06.719 --> 01:30:10.719]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:30:10.719 --> 01:30:14.719]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[01:30:14.719 --> 01:30:18.719]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:23.719]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:30:23.719 --> 01:30:24.719]  Look it up.
[01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.719]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:30:26.719 --> 01:30:29.719]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there,
[01:30:29.719 --> 01:30:32.719]  highest rated at half the price of leading competitors,
[01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:35.719]  the Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:30:35.719 --> 01:30:37.719]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:30:37.719 --> 01:30:39.719]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:30:39.719 --> 01:30:40.719]  It is amazing.
[01:30:40.719 --> 01:30:42.719]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:45.719]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:30:45.719 --> 01:30:46.719]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[01:30:46.719 --> 01:30:50.719]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.

[01:30:55.719 --> 01:30:57.719]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:30:57.719 --> 01:30:58.719]  You need this filter.
[01:30:59.719 --> 01:31:03.719]  Two of our best-selling nootropics, or brain boosters,
[01:31:03.719 --> 01:31:06.719]  are now back in stock at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:06.719 --> 01:31:09.719]  For a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together
[01:31:09.719 --> 01:31:11.719]  or 40% off when you get them individually.
[01:31:11.719 --> 01:31:13.719]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra.
[01:31:13.719 --> 01:31:15.719]  Two separate formulas.
[01:31:15.719 --> 01:31:18.719]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:31:18.719 --> 01:31:22.719]  One is a four- to six-hour good base of clean energy,
[01:31:22.719 --> 01:31:24.719]  again, with no hangover or letdown.
[01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:27.719]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula.
[01:31:27.719 --> 01:31:29.719]  That's Brain Force Ultra that hits really, really quick.
[01:31:29.719 --> 01:31:30.719]  And I love it.
[01:31:30.719 --> 01:31:31.719]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:34.719]  So if I've got to work at night but don't want to stay up all night,
[01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:36.719]  I can take it and stay nine o'clock at night.
[01:31:36.719 --> 01:31:38.719]  I've got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something,
[01:31:38.719 --> 01:31:41.719]  and boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[01:31:41.719 --> 01:31:45.719]  And then I get two, three hours of energy, and then you go right to bed after it.
[01:31:45.719 --> 01:31:50.719]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.719]  A lot of people love these products.
[01:31:52.719 --> 01:31:53.719]  They've got five-star reviews.
[01:31:53.719 --> 01:31:55.719]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should.
[01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:58.719]  50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:32:03.719 --> 01:32:06.719]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[01:32:06.719 --> 01:32:11.719]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:32:11.719 --> 01:32:14.719]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[01:32:54.719 --> 01:32:56.719]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:32:56.719 --> 01:32:57.719]  Please take action.
[01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:19.030]  We're on the march, the N-Wire's on the run, with the republic or against it.
[01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:23.030]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:26.030]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:30.030]  Alright, what's really frustrating is, knowing what the New World Order is doing,
[01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:34.030]  what the globalists are doing, what the big corporations are doing, is not rocket science.
[01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:38.030]  For 500 years we've had the Renaissance upwardly mobile society,
[01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:45.030]  shutting down feudalism and centralized control by governments, by the church, and by corporations.
[01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:50.030]  But going back to the turn of the century before last, 1900,
[01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:54.030]  the robber barons got together with British intelligence on record,
[01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:58.030]  and said we're going to use psychology and systems of economic control
[01:33:58.030 --> 01:34:03.030]  to get back control and create a centralized scientific dictatorship.
[01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:05.030]  You can go read their writings, that's what this is.
[01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:09.030]  And so since then they've been trying to set up the League of Nations, the UN, this whole thing.
[01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:12.030]  They've been trying to break down the family, they've been trying to make people lazy,
[01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:17.030]  they've been trying to use psychology, where if you tell a child your handwriting is ugly,
[01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:21.030]  you need to learn how to write properly, they cry and complain and throw a fit.
[01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:23.030]  Victimology.
[01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:29.030]  And that's again to undermine civilization, collapse it, so that they can then cull it.
[01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:34.030]  Because the globalists can't compete with an open free market competition system.
[01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:37.030]  They had to dynamite it, which they've pretty much done.
[01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:43.030]  And so the UN talks about, oh, by 2030 the world really won't be here anymore.
[01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:49.030]  It's not just AOC and Beto and people saying the world will be basically over by 2030.
[01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:56.030]  The official UN is, oh, billions dead, collapsing, raising water, storms, oh, starvation,
[01:34:56.030 --> 01:35:01.030]  because of their policies cutting off the fertilizer and having lockdowns.
[01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:03.030]  So it's two plus two equals four.
[01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:07.030]  They're saying, oh, things are really about to get bad,
[01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:10.030]  because they just shut the world economy down for several years,
[01:35:10.030 --> 01:35:14.030]  which then was like pulling the rug out from under somebody.
[01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:16.030]  Or your wife makes this great dinner, or your husband makes this great dinner
[01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:21.030]  and sets all the China and food up on the table, and you walk in and overturn the whole table.
[01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:23.030]  And they think you're so stupid.
[01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:26.030]  They go, oh, my gosh, the global warming's why everybody's starving,
[01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:30.030]  why the borders are wide open, and why there's not enough food.
[01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:33.030]  And the UN, soon there won't be any food because of global warming,
[01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:36.030]  says the head of the UN food program.
[01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:40.030]  A hundred million are on the verge of death, an extra 15 million just starved to death.
[01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:42.030]  It's all because of COVID.
[01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:43.030]  No, it's because of your lockdowns.
[01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:48.030]  And now the very same head of the UN food program, who's a nice, well-spoken American guy,
[01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:51.030]  he gets up there and says, folks, please give billions.
[01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:52.030]  The African children are starving.
[01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:53.030]  Look at them.
[01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:57.030]  Bono's raising money right now to give them to the little Africans.
[01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:59.030]  And we love the little black children.
[01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:01.030]  Meanwhile, they give 1% to the black children.
[01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:07.030]  And with that comes control, that they got to stay locked down so they can't grow food.
[01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:11.030]  You just stay in that cage, and I'll give you a piece of bread once a week.
[01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:13.030]  All right, I'm the UN.
[01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:15.030]  But I'm a liberal-loving southerner.
[01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:17.030]  You can trust me.
[01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:22.030]  And, you know, now the UN world food head, type it up.
[01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:25.030]  UN world food head says food shortage is worse ever.
[01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.030]  Hundreds of millions set to starve to death.
[01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:30.030]  And they say because of global warming.
[01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:39.030]  No, they've cut off fertilizer production all over the world, saying it's bad for the earth.
[01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:43.030]  So it's like if I walked up to a guy and a gal sitting, say, at a coffee shop outside,
[01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:46.030]  drinking coffee and eating a piece of pie.
[01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:50.030]  And I said to the man's wife, I said, your husband's about to die because of global warming.
[01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:54.030]  And then I wrapped a tourniquet around his neck, a garotte, and started strangling him.
[01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:55.030]  She'd call the police.
[01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:56.030]  And the cops show up, and he's dead.
[01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:58.030]  And I go, sir, I didn't choke him to death.
[01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:03.030]  Global warming did that.
[01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:08.030]  And, again, they just treat you like superstitious morons.
[01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:09.030]  You know why COVID hit us?
[01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:10.030]  Global warming.
[01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:15.030]  It just got hot in those caves, and, you know, it just had happened.
[01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:19.030]  So that's where we are.
[01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:21.030]  And we need to wake up to it.
[01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:25.030]  So I'm going to play the clip of Gutierrez going into one of these.
[01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:28.030]  You notice the U.N. videos are just like the W.H. videos?
[01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:31.030]  Well, that's because it's all the same group.
[01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:34.030]  The Davos group is the U.N.
[01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:36.030]  And I told you that for years.
[01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:40.030]  Last year they officially merged.
[01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:47.030]  So here is the W.E.F., U.N.
[01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:51.030]  Secretary General, all the same thing, telling you this.
[01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:56.030]  But first, here's a few clips of other globalists, the head of the Bank of
[01:37:56.030 --> 01:38:00.030]  Settlements, the head of BlackRock, telling you how to cow out the cabbage.
[01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:01.030]  Here it is.
[01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:03.030]  Behaviors are going to have to change.
[01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:05.030]  And this is one thing we're asking companies.
[01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:08.030]  You have to force behaviors.
[01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:11.030]  And at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors.
[01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:17.030]  For example, in cash, we don't know, for example, who is using a $100 bill
[01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:18.030]  today.
[01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:21.030]  We don't know who is using a 1,000-peso bill today.
[01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:28.030]  A key difference with the CBDC is that central bank will have absolute
[01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:34.030]  control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that
[01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:38.030]  expression of central bank liability.
[01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:42.030]  And also, we will have the technology to enforce that.
[01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:47.030]  And the one final note I will make is that if you think about the benefits of
[01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:50.030]  digital money, there are huge potential gains.
[01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:53.030]  It's not just about digital forms of physical currency.
[01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:57.030]  You can have programmability, you know, units of central bank currency with
[01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:58.030]  expiry dates.
[01:38:58.030 --> 01:39:03.030]  You could have, as I argue in my book, a potentially better and some people
[01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:07.030]  might see for a darker world where the government decides that units of
[01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:11.030]  central bank money can be used to purchase some things but not other things
[01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:16.030]  that it deems less desirable, like say ammunition or drugs or pornography or
[01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:17.030]  something of the sort.
[01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:21.030]  And that is very powerful in terms of the use of a CBDC.
[01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:26.030]  Together, let us make sure we use artificial intelligence to enhance human
[01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:29.030]  dignity and serve the global good.
[01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:35.030]  And it shows the wonderful world that AI map for poverty, for particular
[01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:36.030]  analysis.
[01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:38.030]  AI increase agriculture productivity.
[01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:39.030]  Hit pause.
[01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:40.030]  Back to the beginning.
[01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:41.030]  I'm going to go over this.
[01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:47.030]  And again, everything they say they're doing, they're doing the opposite.
[01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:51.030]  I mean, I can't even believe they've shut down already 10,000 farms in
[01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:55.030]  Netherlands, and they say 90% will be shut down by 2050, by 2030.
[01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:57.030]  I can't believe they're shutting down the Irish farms.
[01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:59.030]  They're just doing it.
[01:39:59.030 --> 01:40:04.030]  And they're announcing here, oh, organic food's the worst.
[01:40:04.030 --> 01:40:10.030]  Stuff made in a lab is what's good, and we're just listening to this crap?
[01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:14.030]  They're building a dystopia and telling you things are going to collapse
[01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:17.030]  because you're bad, and then they're going to have to come in and stop us
[01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:22.030]  because we're wrecking things when they're the ones wrecking things publicly.
[01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:26.030]  Go back to it.
[01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:32.030]  AI to map poverty for predictive analytics.
[01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:35.030]  So that means they can track slowly how they turn off your resources,
[01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:38.030]  tell you there's another way to do it so you believe there's a false hope,
[01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:41.030]  which then gets you deeper under their control.
[01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:43.030]  AI to increase agricultural productivity.
[01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:46.030]  When you see that rainbow swastika, that's the Davos group, folks.
[01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:49.030]  That's the world government.
[01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:50.030]  That's the cult.
[01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:51.030]  Continue.
[01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:53.030]  AI to analyze vast amounts of health care data.
[01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:55.030]  Oh, yeah, you don't have any privacy.
[01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:56.030]  You end running your health care.
[01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:57.030]  Continue.
[01:40:57.030 --> 01:41:01.030]  Oh, the contact tracing says you were near somebody who had COVID.
[01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:03.030]  You disappeared to a FEMA camp.
[01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:06.030]  AI to revolutionize classrooms with individualized learning.
[01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:09.030]  Oh, they come in, take over education,
[01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:12.030]  bankrupt it with their own programming, shut it down, it paused.
[01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:17.030]  And then they bring you U.N. training,
[01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:19.030]  plus you're locked in your house during the next lockdown.
[01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:22.030]  AI to pinpoint gender inequity.
[01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:23.030]  Drive balanced hiring.
[01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:28.030]  Make sure your company hires 50% women or whatever,
[01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:30.030]  even though the women want to stay home with their kids.
[01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:31.030]  See how this works?
[01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:33.030]  Total surveillance by the AI.
[01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:37.030]  Oh, this AI is going to give us all our freedom programmed by the U.N.
[01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:40.030]  AI to improve efficient, clean water provision.
[01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:42.030]  Oh, they'll make sure there's plenty of water
[01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:46.030]  and the right additives are put in it, like fluoride.
[01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:51.030]  AI to improve photovoltaic energy capture.
[01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:53.030]  Fancy way to say solar panels.
[01:41:57.030 --> 01:42:01.030]  AI to improve productivity through intelligent innovation, automation.
[01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:03.030]  Get rid of humans in the factories.
[01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:05.030]  Make sure there's nothing humans can do anymore.
[01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:06.030]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:08.030]  Man, thank you, AI.
[01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:09.030]  Replace the humans.
[01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:13.030]  Continue.
[01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:19.030]  AI to help drive industry innovation.
[01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:20.030]  Get rid of more people.
[01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:21.030]  That's great.
[01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:22.030]  Continue.
[01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:29.030]  AI to build a more inclusive society, i.e. disability robots.
[01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:32.030]  Oh, you're all going to get robots because you'll be so poisoned
[01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:34.030]  from the shots that are watching you and taking care of you
[01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:37.030]  and finally euthanize you when the time comes.
[01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:39.030]  AI to power urban planning decisions.
[01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:41.030]  Yeah, 15-minute cities through sensor data.
[01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:44.030]  Yes, spy bots, everything watching you everywhere.
[01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:46.030]  Oh, this is so wonderful.
[01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:47.030]  I can't wait.
[01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:50.030]  AI to predict optimum production levels to reduce waste.
[01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:52.030]  Oh, it'll tell you what you can spend, what you can do.
[01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:56.030]  Let's come back and hear more about how wonderful UN-run AI is.
[01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:58.030]  Oh, my gosh, I live for them.
[01:42:59.030 --> 01:43:04.030]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:06.030]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:08.030]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:10.030]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:11.030]  Hey, what's better?
[01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:12.030]  Knockout.
[01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:13.030]  What's better?
[01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:14.030]  Down and out.
[01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:15.030]  What's better?
[01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:17.030]  We sell two or three different sleep aids.
[01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:19.030]  And the answer is different herbal formulas,
[01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:22.030]  different compounds are better for different people.
[01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:25.030]  So one person might like this coffee.
[01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:26.030]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:28.030]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:29.030]  They're all very diverse.
[01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:32.030]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller
[01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:34.030]  that's been sold for many years that people love
[01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:40.030]  and sold for a lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.
[01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:43.030]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds
[01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:45.030]  that give you deeper, cleaner, restful sleep.
[01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:50.030]  And it's stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates.
[01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:53.030]  So get your Infowars MD Good Night Sleep today.
[01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:54.030]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:06.030]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:07.030]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:08.030]  It is.
[01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:10.030]  But if you took it with fish oil,
[01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:13.030]  it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:14.030]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:16.030]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:18.030]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:22.030]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:23.030]  Krill oils is the best.
[01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:24.030]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:25.030]  And I'm sorry.
[01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:26.030]  You want something like this?
[01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:27.030]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:29.030]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:30.030]  It's so good in my view.
[01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:32.030]  I'm not making a medical statement here.
[01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:33.030]  But let me tell you something.
[01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:35.030]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:37.030]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:43.030]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:48.030]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it.
[01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:49.030]  But you notice I just obsess.
[01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:52.030]  Because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:53.030]  I just can't do it.
[01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:54.030]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:58.030 --> 01:45:00.030]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show.
[01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:03.030]  Joined by the one and only Greg Reese of The Reese Report.
[01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:06.030]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:10.030]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reese.

[01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:17.030]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:19.030]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:24.030]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water
[01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:26.030]  whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:28.030]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:31.030]  the Gravity Fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:33.030]  Absolutely.
[01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:38.030]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:41.030]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR.
[01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:43.030]  The real NPR of The Based Right.
[01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:46.030]  So, click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:47.030]  Take out your phone.

[01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:52.030]  Support The Infowar.
[01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:55.030]  Keep Alex Jones, Orrin Schroer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reese, Adam King,
[01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:57.030]  and the rest of us on air.
[01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:58.030]  Do it today.
[01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:59.030]  Do it now.
[01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:00.030]  Support The Infowar.
[01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:02.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,
[01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:03.030]  The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:06.030]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words,
[01:46:06.030 --> 01:46:08.030]  planned for our future.
[01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:09.030]  That is the hellish future.
[01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:12.030]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books,
[01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:13.030]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:16.030]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World
[01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:19.030]  at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:22.030]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:25.030]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:27.030]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:30.030]  So, get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:32.030]  a signed copy, at infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:36.030]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:39.030]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:42.030]  you'll also know that you helped keep Infowars on the air.
[01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:45.030]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book
[01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:46.030]  or unsigned copies.
[01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:49.030]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet
[01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:52.030]  to go to infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy
[01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:55.030]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:57.030]  or give them to the local school.
[01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:58.030]  This is an Infowar.
[01:46:58.030 --> 01:47:00.030]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:05.030]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:07.030]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:18.040]  So, the criminal U.N. set up by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds dedicated to depopulating you
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:22.400]  in a post-industrial world says, oh, AI is going to empower your life and then starts
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:27.880]  listing 17 nightmare slides that will literally destroy your life.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:31.080]  Let's go back to where we are at slide 10 and we'll go to your phone calls.
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.360]  Put it back up, please.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:36.600]  AI to predict optimal production levels to reduce waste.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.400]  So, it's going to decide what you can produce and what you can do.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.600]  That's AI controlling companies and that's the ESGs.
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.600]  Next.
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:50.840]  AI to model climate change to predict disasters.
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.720]  Oh, yes.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.600]  All their fraudulent models, all their garbage, every time there's a disaster, it's always
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  happening.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.600]  Earthquakes, floods.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:47:59.600]  They can blame it on that.
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:00.600]  More of their voodoo.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.600]  That's right.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.600]  AI to be programmed to go along with that fraud.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.000]  AI to track illegal fishing through pattern recognition software.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Yes, they're going to harass the little fishermen, but not the Japanese trawlers.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.600]  And then, of course, continuing slide 16, AI to outwit poachers and monitor species
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:20.600]  health.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.520]  Remember how the head of the World Wildlife Fund got caught secretly running the poachers?
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:27.400]  That was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:31.440]  AI to reduce discrimination and corruption in government.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:37.880]  Sure, the NSA on steroids is going to stop the corruption, not protect the corruption,
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:41.040]  not be used to spy on the good guys and censor political opposition.
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.040]  Sure.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:45.760]  But doesn't it sound great to corrupt you in with all this power?
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:49.840]  AI to empower essential multitask holder partnerships.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:51.840]  There you go.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.040]  That means all the different little globalist groups that get to be on the titty.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.240]  All the little selected knighthoods continue.
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:00.720]  So there's their program.
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.360]  There's their pyramid of power.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:06.520]  Let's go to your phone calls, John in Canada on Trump 24.
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:07.520]  What do you think?
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:08.520]  Go ahead.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.520]  Hey, Alex.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:10.520]  How's it going?
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:13.000]  I hope all the info warriors out there are doing great.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.800]  What I want to talk about is Trump representing one side of a duality that is existing in
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:23.520]  all of our systems, all of our fundamental systems right now, the immovable objects and
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.360]  the unstoppable force.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:29.280]  So what happens when those two forces meet each other?
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.080]  Well, it's actually an implosion.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.000]  You get an implosion of things.
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.760]  So as a result, you know, globalists know that they can't get Trump out or they can't get
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:43.440]  a guarantee for an elected representative, just like they can't guarantee that they can
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.320]  keep our economy going, that they can keep their systems going, that they can push their
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.740]  social agendas.
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:52.800]  So these two forces are hitting each other.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.960]  And as a result, we're going to get an implosion.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.600]  When the implosion happens, it's an implosion of our institutions.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:03.760]  And when institutions go away, mankind tends to rely on his more basic instincts.
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.580]  He goes back to the fundamentals, his ideologies, his religion.
[01:50:07.580 --> 01:50:08.580]  What does he believe?
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:15.200]  And on those levels and those things is a more sort of animalistic approach to life,
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:19.760]  where we're going to see sort of, you know, people are going to become who they really
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.160]  are essentially.
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:27.360]  It's all going to come out in a real manifest way.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:28.360]  I think you're incredible.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.420]  I think you're absolutely dead on.
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:34.600]  And you're right when you have super high powered atomic weights going against each other.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:39.020]  A lot of times, depending on the equation, it creates a black hole or a strangelet.
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:44.080]  It doesn't create a chain reaction, hydrogen bomb type explosion.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:47.520]  And the globalists have put us into an actual implosion.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.840]  And all I'm saying is, ladies and gentlemen, you look at the forces colliding.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.440]  It is spectacularly dangerous.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.360]  But even if the globalists were left alone by Trump, they're going to wreck everything
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:02.120]  by design because they just have this mad scientist, nihilistic, anti-human drive.
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:03.920]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.720]  Candice in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:06.720]  Welcome.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.720]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:14.080]  Just wanted to say, Candice K. Morris on Facebook, at Queen of the Juicy on Twitter and your
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:21.960]  survival shield and golden toothpaste has boosted my IQ at least 33 points, Alex.
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.400]  Well, all right.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.400]  That's quite a boost.
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:25.400]  What's on your mind?
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.400]  Yeah.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:33.120]  I wanted to know, do you believe that Trump will submit to the illegal surveillance and
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.120]  future lockdown?
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.120]  No, I don't think.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:36.120]  Oh, no.
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:38.560]  In the future, he said no more lockdowns.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.400]  The future, he said no more forced injections.
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:42.040]  He was never for the forced injections.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.880]  He just won't admit he was wrong and conned.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.240]  I mean, I know why he's doing it.
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:50.160]  He thinks he'll get hurt worse by admitting it was all a fraud and he thinks it'll give
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.400]  him liability.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:53.560]  So that's one thing Trump does is covers his ass.
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:56.280]  And I think him going along with the shots, the worst thing he ever did.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:59.040]  But he tried to green light every treatment, everything.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.120]  And there was everything he was promoting.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.440]  He was just trying to get things going.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.440]  And Trump has it.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.880]  And I know people that know Trump well.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.000]  He has an inordinate respect for military officers and doctors.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.400]  Now, he doesn't so much now, but we're talking he was brought up to the military, worship
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.400]  it.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:19.480]  Well, our military is great people, but not not when they're hijacked at the top.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.960]  So he really thought generals were like the best guys and they were the best guys.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.160]  And he didn't know they were globalist operatives, most of them.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:28.760]  And he really thinks doctors are the best things to slice bread.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:32.560]  And average doctors are pretty cool people, but they're now corporately controlled.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:38.800]  So Trump's got some big blind spots and he's he's really gotten informed now.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:46.880]  And Alex, before 2020, Trump was having rallies while he was president.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:54.000]  And he was saying at these rallies that we needed to build more psychiatric hospitals
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.760]  to protect people from gun violence.
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:59.640]  Now this was all before 2020.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:05.640]  Now Trump admits that we're in a fascist, totalitarian system.
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:10.720]  And he was at the at one point at the head of the fascists.
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:11.720]  Yes, I understand.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:16.120]  I understand that Trump was talking about mental patients getting guns.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:20.320]  And I think Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said that he said the drugs are the main driver.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.240]  The psychotropics caused this to happen.
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.280]  Are you saying you're going to are you going to vote for Biden then or what should we do?
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:32.040]  Well, well, I'm just saying since we do know we live under fascists and I went to my local
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:37.360]  community in Cheatham County to talk about the Tennessee Valley Authority coming and
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:44.320]  building these big power generators and power storage facilities in my local hometown judge
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.360]  who was an elected official.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:51.240]  I don't even know that the that at the local level that the elections are legitimate.
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:54.880]  Well, I mean, yes, ma'am, a local are the most fraudulent there are.
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.280]  It's very hard to steal national elections is very easy to local.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.280]  Thank you so much.
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:03.400]  I have my reservations about Trump, but no, I don't think he's a bad person.
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:06.560]  A lot of people say they should reopen mental institutions.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:11.080]  One movie, those that flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:15.480]  Got the state hospital shut down and undoubtedly they had abuses and they were bad.
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:21.000]  Now we replace one bad thing with another bad thing.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.720]  And we have an open air mental institution and all the drugs and then the rest of it
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:28.720]  is.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:34.360]  I mean, the mental problems now are just absolutely exploding.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:39.840]  So replace one evil, it's like replacing apartheid with communism, something even worse.
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:43.240]  So, yeah, I know you're talking about red flag laws, the rest of it.
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:45.440]  Another one of the things that Trump at least paid homage to.
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:46.440]  All right.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Simon in Florida.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:49.160]  You're on the air.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:50.160]  Go ahead.
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.160]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:52.160]  This is Simon from Florida.
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.440]  I was talking with you previously and it was unfortunate that when I was booked to speak
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:01.680]  with you, I was busy that day and I decided I couldn't have you on that day.
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:03.280]  It wasn't some conspiracy with the crew.
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.280]  I get really busy.
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.000]  The fact that I was going to get you on the show is fine.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.520]  But right now, do you want to make comments on the current topics?
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:09.520]  Absolutely.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.520]  I do.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:16.320]  I was going to speak to you about the high level political forum that is occurring right
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:24.400]  now at the U.N., specifically talking about advancing the implementation of the SDGs.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:31.480]  It's important for people to understand when you use the phrase doubling down, this is
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:37.840]  literally what is occurring because we're now halfway through the period from 2015 to
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:44.840]  2030 and they're saying that they've achieved one third of their goals.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:50.160]  In the remaining half, they have two thirds of their goals to achieve.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:54.240]  So they literally have to double the rate.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.200]  When you say they are doubling down, you are being mathematically correct.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:04.600]  That's what people need to understand, that whatever influences they've experienced so
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:10.440]  far, and as disgusted and in disagreement that they are, things are going to get twice
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:17.320]  as worse because they have doubled the amount to do in the same period of time that is already
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:19.080]  expired.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:27.560]  And people have to remember that 2030 is the deadline.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:33.240]  And then what comes after 2030 is the actual complete extermination operation.
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:37.000]  2030 is just getting the straitjacket on us, in my view.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.440]  Well, I would agree with that.
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:45.480]  People can read about this by going to hashtag HLPS and all the documents are available there.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:51.280]  This is a two-week conference, we're in the last three days.
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.320]  And I'm just trying to reach out to you often to try and get information across.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.480]  Now it's almost in arrear.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:03.760]  I appreciate you went to meet Steven Crowder that day in Dallas, but I was then rescheduled
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:04.760]  four times.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:08.080]  Listen, I can't do producing on air, I appreciate your call.
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:10.720]  I think the issue is you wanted to have some other guest on with you and I didn't know who
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:12.000]  they were, so I shouldn't do it.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.160]  So I can't do producing on air.
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.160]  Not going to do it.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:16.840]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:17.840]  I appreciate you.
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:18.840]  Sometimes I try to get people booked on the show.
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:19.840]  I get busy.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:20.840]  They get unbooked.
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.280]  And then it's not the issue with my producers, I set people up.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:26.240]  I'm the one that runs this show.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:29.600]  So Simon, boom, you got in, you talked about your issues.
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:31.800]  And you know, I know we're way behind on the ESGs and everything.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.120]  We'll try to get better next time.
[01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:35.640]  We're actually way ahead the whole thing.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:39.000]  The whole point is anything coming out of the UN is the enemy.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.800]  Anything coming out of the UN is the problem.
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.360]  Anything coming out of the UN must be opposed.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:43.360]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.600]  Stay with us in full wars.com.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.600]  Ow!
[01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:53.540]  The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central banks, they have
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:57.540]  a lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are going to
[01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:01.540]  take decades to stop. But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:06.540]  and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with. And
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:12.540]  you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there. This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:16.540]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through in a day. It purifies very quickly
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:20.540]  and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels. This is what I use,
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:24.540]  what my family uses. It's the very best system out there for the lowest price. For a limited
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:30.540]  time, 10% off on top of that. Exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa Pure water
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:35.540]  filtration system. In stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.

[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:43.540]  we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:48.540]  that they allow in the water supply. In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.

[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:24.540]  July 4th sale is going on right now. This is such a critical platform in the fight against
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:27.540]  the new world order. The enemies out in the open were vindicated. People are listening
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:31.540]  more than ever. But in this major recession going into depression, and with supply chain
[01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:35.540]  breakdowns, I know it's hard. I know times are tough. So thank you for your support.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:39.540]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos. That
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:43.540]  you can do for free. And that's just as important as keeping us on air. So however God leads
[01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:46.540]  you in your heart to support us, please support us now. And I thank you from the bottom of
[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:48.540]  my heart. God bless you.
[01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:56.540]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:15.540]  Bragg in Ohio. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:22.540]  Great. Thanks. I'm so glad you're covering this ESG, SDG, NGO, making the connection
[02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:27.540]  there. Because in my opinion, this could be the most important topic of all. Because our
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:32.540]  country is based on capitalism. And if you break down that capitalism structure, we don't
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:41.540]  have a whole lot left. So if we think about, you go back to God, people, good people, true
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:46.540]  capitalism, Adam Smith, the invisible hand. I mean, that's what's driven this country.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:52.540]  And that's deflationary. Innovation is deflationary. These guys are taking us in the way of inflation,
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:57.540]  which I'm sure we could talk for hours on this. But the point is, inflation and the
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:01.540]  connection to the things you were talking about go hand in hand, in my opinion. And
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:08.540]  I've spent 90,000 plus hours in the markets over the last 30 years. And I see someone's
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:11.540]  got complete control over these financial markets right now. So what you're talking
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:13.540]  about is totally spot on.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:20.540]  Oh, yeah. The AI is a consortium of systems already in control that humans run. Now they're
[02:01:20.540 --> 02:01:25.540]  going to turn the rest of the economy over to this and design it to, again, incrementally
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:32.540]  turn off 50% of the energy, 50% of consumption. Can you imagine that world? I mean, we're
[02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:34.540]  talking genocide.
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:39.540]  Well, yeah, for sure. But think about all the different commodity markets. You've got
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:43.540]  precious metals, right? Everybody's selling a bill of goods, buy gold, buy silver. These
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:48.540]  guys could take gold and silver down to 700, 1100 in gold without a blink of an eye, right?
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:53.540]  And totally explain it away, use the media, cover it up, talk about some story, and then
[02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:57.540]  come back and buy it on the cheap, run it back up to 5,000. I mean, this goes on in
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:01.540]  energy, it goes on in the agricultural market. Look at Ukraine and what happened to wheat.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:07.540]  I mean, a bushel of wheat went from $4 a bushel to $14 or something like that, right?
[02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:15.540]  So I just can't stress, I mean, this needs to be covered more. This is such an important
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:21.540]  topic, right? I mean, I've spent my life in these markets, right? So I mean, I hope that
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:25.540]  people will heed this warning that what you just covered is so critical, and it needs
[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:31.540]  to be covered. I mean, this needs to be pounded, and every, like you talk about, Tucker and
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:35.540]  Joe Rogan, I mean, we need to get people on talking about this, because this is such an
[02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:39.540]  important topic. Capitalism's gone without it. I mean, what you're talking about is spot
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:40.540]  on.
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:45.540]  It's not like we're just getting rid of capitalism. These horrible human depopulationists will
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:51.540]  then be in total control and pick the winners and losers. This is complete social engineering,
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:56.540]  and we already see cutting children's genitals off, having fat men dressed like prostitutes
[02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:01.540]  shake their butts in little kids' faces. They're showing us the ugliest, craziest stuff
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:06.540]  up front to just set the precedent that, yeah, you're in a dystopia now. Give up. I mean,
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:08.540]  this is hell on earth they're building.
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:13.540]  Well, and just one quick thing, you know, just one thing for people to keep in mind.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:19.540]  Inflation is really the work of the devil, okay? Deflation is the work of God, right?
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:23.540]  Because it benefits the little guy, right? The little guy, he gets more for every hour
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:24.540]  of work, right?
[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:29.540]  Be fruitful, go out and prosper. Absolutely. I mean, look at life. Look at the fruit trees.
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:32.540]  It's an abundance God gives us, not less.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:34.540]  Exactly. Exactly.
[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:39.540]  Well, how do you, what do you make of them saying they're pulling back ESGs, but then
[02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:41.540]  accelerating the SDGs?
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:47.540]  Well, look, it's just a cover-up, right? I mean, you know, look, I could talk to you
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:52.540]  for hours on Larry Fink, right? BlackRock, Moynihan, they're all bought and paid for.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:56.540]  You know, Jamie Dimon's questionable in some ways, but it doesn't matter. The point is,
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:01.540]  I've got video on these guys, you know, they're totally, they don't even understand what they're
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:04.540]  doing, but they're just doing it. They're exactly what you're talking about. They're
[02:04:04.540 --> 02:04:08.540]  just minions. And, you know, you'd say Larry Fink is a minion. I think he's a minion, right?
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:11.540]  I mean, even though he's worth billions and he's running BlackRock, I don't really, I've
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:15.540]  got video that proves he really doesn't know what he's doing. He's just doing what he's
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:16.540]  told, you know?
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:21.540]  One hundred percent. When you see a Klaus Schwab or a Larry Fink, or even a Bill Gates,
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:25.540]  they're still just functionaries, and there are really wicked groups behind them.
[02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:28.540]  Thank you so much. Amazing call, Greg. Call back again.
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:32.540]  We're going to continue with phone calls. We have a special guest joining us in studio
[02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:36.540]  as well to talk about the whole state of the world, but we'll get to all your calls.
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:42.540]  Jordan and James and Ben and James and BattleCry, Samuel, Robert and Moose.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:46.540]  No more callers after that, but if you're on the board, I'm going to get to you.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:50.540]  And I'm going to host a little bit in the next hour as well with Gerald Cilente.
[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:53.540]  So we'll get to everybody's calls. Please stay with us. InfoWars.com.
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:54.540]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:04:58.540 --> 02:05:03.540]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[02:05:03.540 --> 02:05:09.540]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy,
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:14.540]  in my view, if you don't get high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:17.540]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo. That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:20.540]  and learn how to use if you haven't. And I preach to the choir on that.
[02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:24.540]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:29.540]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:31.540]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:35.540]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices
[02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:37.540]  you're going to find and still get quality.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:42.540]  InfoWars.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:45.540]  and on water and air filtration.
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:49.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal. Our prices are already the lowest.
[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:52.540]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:56.540]  So go to InfoWars.com and get prepared while you still can.
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:06.559]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful, and I hope
[02:06:06.559 --> 02:06:13.000]  that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute, because I've had chills since
[02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.220]  last night.
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:19.000]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:26.040]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:30.600]  mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:31.600]  documents.
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:36.400]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:40.160]  sterilize you and to force vaccines and the hell we're already living in.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:44.280]  This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:45.280]  madmen.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:47.800]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:51.340]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:55.160]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:59.960]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:05.900]  producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never
[02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:06.900]  read them all.
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:10.200]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:14.800]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:20.040]  and the will to be able to face this horror and to give me the strength to carry on, because
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.620]  I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:29.140]  on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:33.059]  I know why, because it's scary.
[02:07:33.059 --> 02:07:40.220]  You're not going to be able to go to the ballgames anymore.
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:42.380]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:48.220]  You're not going to be able to just, you know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:54.780]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:08:01.260]  that takes its time to incrementally enslave you mentally, psychologically, physically,
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:07.940]  spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize
[02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:13.100]  that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:17.260]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will
[02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:18.500]  take over your life.
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:20.100]  It should take over your life.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:22.140]  I mean, what else?
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:25.380]  What else could it do?
[02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:29.580]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:37.380]  putting out for decades ahead of their open unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:40.820]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[02:08:40.820 --> 02:08:45.460]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness
[02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:48.820]  of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[02:08:48.820 --> 02:08:53.380]  Win, lose or draw, you need to choose a side.
[02:08:53.380 --> 02:08:54.380]  Wars.
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:57.860]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:08:57.860 --> 02:09:03.660]  We are here today to tell you, you picked this fight.
[02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:05.140]  You wanted this fight.
[02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:07.300]  Well, guess what?
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:08.300]  You've got it.
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:09.300]  Let's fight.
[02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:10.300]  It's 1159 Radio Free America.
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.300]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:12.300]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:13.300]  The chair is against the wall.
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:14.300]  The chair is against the wall.
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:15.300]  John has a long mustache.
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:16.300]  John has a long mustache.
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:17.300]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:18.300]  Another day closer to victory.
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:19.300]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.300]  And it's time!
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:21.300]  It's time!
[02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:22.300]  It's time!
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:23.300]  It's time!
[02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:24.300]  It's time!
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:25.300]  It's time!
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:26.300]  It's time!
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:27.300]  It's time!
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.300]  It's time!
[02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:29.300]  It's time!
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.300]  It's time!
[02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:31.300]  It's time!
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:32.300]  It's time!
[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:33.300]  It's time!
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:34.300]  It's time!
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.300]  It's time!
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:36.300]  It's time!
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:37.300]  It's time!
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:43.300]  And it's time for humanity to stand up and the oddball war and say,
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:47.300]  I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but
[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:49.300]  you wanna fight?
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.300]  You better believe you got one!
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:55.300]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:10:01.300]  Ah it's going to become 100% clear.
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:02.900]  Not this audience who's already very awake.
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:05.300]  The general public on what trouble they're in very very quickly.
[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:09.660]  quickly. And the controlled corporate media is gonna tell people, it's your
[02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:12.460]  fault, it's the global warming, it's why everybody's starved to death, why the borders
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:16.059]  have collapsed, why crime's everywhere. But if you go down every one of those
[02:10:16.059 --> 02:10:20.780]  points, Klaus Schwab's written books saying we're gonna cut the resources off,
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:23.580]  we're gonna create an angrier world, we're gonna cut the resources off in the
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:27.660]  third world and flood the first world, we're gonna break down society and
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:31.700]  destroy the old capitalist system so they'll accept the new corporate feudalist
[02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:36.500]  fascist slash communist operation. And that's what the new book that was
[02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:41.940]  already gonna be done a few weeks ago is about. But he's here this week with me,
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:46.820]  been here with me, we just wrote two more chapters this weekend, he's adding
[02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:51.620]  documents to it, this book's getting up there past 450 pages right now, it'll be
[02:10:51.620 --> 02:10:57.260]  done in a couple weeks, it'll go to the printers, and it'll be, things ship so
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:01.420]  fast now, print so fast at Skyhorse, it'll be shipping in late August. The
[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:07.620]  Great Awakening, defeating the globalist and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:12.780]  We can't just challenge their new old order, we've got to have our resistance
[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:16.300]  to it. So we cover the waterfront and explain what's happening versus what we
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:19.620]  could build together, this is gonna be a very important book. It's very important,
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:23.180]  people say why do you advertise it on Amazon? Because New York Times had hit
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:26.740]  number one but they didn't record it, but when something hits in the top
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:31.220]  political books early on, that makes all the bookstores order it, so the book
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:36.220]  gets out in the bookstore and then that has a bigger effect in culture. Our last
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:39.820]  book together, The Great Reset and the War for the World, became a number one New
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:43.780]  York Times bestseller, number one USA Today, number one Washington Post, but the
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:46.220]  New York Times would not put it even in the top hundred because they're a fraud.
[02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:49.980]  That's fine, but the point is it going number one in that makes it get even
[02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:54.420]  bigger. We want this to go to number one before it's even released, go pre-order it
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:58.740]  as an active resistance at Amazon.com, we have links up on the front page of
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:03.940]  Infowars.com, but I want to cover just the world and a bunch of topics with
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:12.420]  Kent Heben-Lively and get into just what's happening in the world and
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:15.980]  where he sees it going and already being a best-selling author, what it's like to
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:20.019]  work on a book like this and Kent will also get into some of the talking points,
[02:12:20.019 --> 02:12:24.780]  not even talking points, topics that you want to get into, the threat from AI, the
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:29.500]  social engineers, digital currency, military spending, review of JFK and
[02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:33.300]  Eisenhower, Hollywood corruption and anti-god groups who want to control
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:37.300]  society, the real story behind Jeffrey Epstein and Peter Nygaard, I mean this
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:42.700]  book is crazy. It's got real secret of adrenochrome in it, the intelligence
[02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:46.100]  background of Bill Barr, the education of Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan, how the
[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:50.260]  globalists are failing on all fronts, but how we can build a new future, the truth,
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:59.860]  not just the real Anthony Fauci 2.0, but the real Professor Hotez, I mean this
[02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:04.019]  is an amazing, amazing book. Kent, great to have you here with us. Thanks for
[02:13:04.019 --> 02:13:07.140]  having me. Kent Heben-Lively, you're an awesome guy,
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:12.500]  we've become a good friend of mine, had fun at lunch yesterday with myself and
[02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:16.820]  you and my wife. What is it like working on this book? Because you were saying
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:20.019]  you're already super awake, but this has been quite the deep dive. You know, I just
[02:13:20.019 --> 02:13:24.660]  feel like I'm a kid in a candy store, Alex, because I've been in this
[02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:30.140]  alternative world for about 15-20 years and what's been great working with you
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:35.059]  is that, you know, I'll have questions. I'll say, Alex, give me the story
[02:13:35.059 --> 02:13:39.780]  of Jeffrey Epstein, because even though I've read a lot of stuff, I still
[02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:43.100]  don't have the narrative. And then you give me your perspective and then I'd
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:48.740]  say, okay, can you give me some sources to go to? You give me those sources and bang,
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:56.740]  it's right on. So I'm really enjoying so much putting into book form your
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:01.460]  understanding of the world, backing it up with evidence. I think that the reading
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:04.820]  public is really going to enjoy this book and be enlightened by it and
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:08.100]  also be inspired by it, because one of the things that you had said to me is
[02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:14.019]  you really wanted this to be a positive book with solutions and we've got a
[02:14:14.019 --> 02:14:19.140]  minute. Just talking about the adrenochrome section, what's so
[02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:24.340]  frustrating is it's on record that what we think of as adrenochrome is there and
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:28.460]  it's being produced at laboratories all over the world, not just by Peter Nygaard,
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:31.700]  and we don't just have news articles. I said, you know there's video of him
[02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:37.500]  admitting this, where he gets women pregnant with his baby and then they
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:42.059]  suck the baby dry of its every bit, its blood, its stem cells, and inject his own
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:47.540]  baby into himself. Now, I mean that's beyond a vampire. Yeah, absolutely. And
[02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:51.500]  they're black babies. So one of the things that was really interesting for
[02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:56.100]  me is, personally, I've never understood the Jeffrey Epstein story. I mean, I
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:15:01.139]  understood parts of it. I understood that it was really strange how this, you know,
[02:15:01.139 --> 02:15:05.980]  guy who had not gone to college, who was a math professor at the Dalton School,
[02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:10.460]  hired by Donald Barr, ends up with billions and billions of dollars. And
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:15.340]  you, you know, gave me the information and you said, okay, you know, look here, look
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:20.139]  there, look at Peter Nygaard. They're producing at the Zorro Ranch, all of it,
[02:15:20.139 --> 02:15:25.300]  women gestating fetuses for a sanguination. Yeah, and so what I did was,
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:30.380]  in that chapter, was I go to the New York Times for their article on Zorro
[02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:36.100]  Ranch, and in the New York Times they say, oh, Jeffrey Epstein, he wants to create a
[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:40.740]  super race of babies. He's wanted to impregnate 20 women. And I'm thinking to
[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:45.780]  myself, does Jeffrey Epstein look like a daddy kind of guy? Does he look like the
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:50.620]  Mormon who wants to live in a big compound with lots of women and raise
[02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:54.420]  his children? Well, young Jeffrey Epstein, he looks like a serial killer. Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:59.900]  So, you know, then you give me into, you know, clue me into Peter Nygaard, and I
[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:06.540]  find the information that what Nygaard was doing, and this is evidence by his
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:12.300]  his former girlfriend, and this video that's showing right now, is what he
[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:16.580]  was doing. And this sounds crazy, but it's all there, and it's all documented in our
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:22.940]  book, is what he was claiming to do is to impregnate women, to get them
[02:16:22.940 --> 02:16:27.900]  pregnant, then have them abort the children at about five or six weeks, and
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:32.460]  then use that as a source for stem cells to stay young. And he's claimed to
[02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:36.100]  be doing it with many other people. And the reason smaller is better is the
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:40.460]  women can get pregnant more frequently, and then he tells them later, you
[02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:44.340]  can share in your child's blood with me, it's so delicious, because it's that
[02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:51.619]  early cells that they want. Yeah, and so, you know, it's just, it's crazy,
[02:16:51.619 --> 02:16:56.460]  and it really is beyond Dracula and vampirism, because, you know, the fictional
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:17:01.980]  vampires, they're feeding on people they don't know, generally, but this
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:07.220]  is killing your own children in order to stay young. I mean, look how
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:11.180]  creepy Jeffrey Epstein is. He hired to work it and run a whole part
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:17.100]  of the girls school, and he worked for Bill Barr, his dad, who on record wrote
[02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:21.460]  books about pedophilia, and was an intelligence operative. Yeah, yeah, and so for
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:27.100]  those who don't know, Donald Barr wrote two science fiction novels. One of them
[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:32.340]  was called Space Relations, which was about alien human sex slavery, and I'm
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:37.060]  thinking to myself, gee, why are you running a K through 12 school for the
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:41.340]  elite, and you're writing these books? How can you continue working? He's obviously
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:45.660]  connected to Maxwell, who was the handler, not the woman Maxwell, Maxwell's dad. Yeah.
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:51.860]  And so, you know, we've got like a 40 or 50 page chapter on Jeffrey
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:55.740]  Epstein, but there's a whole book on Jeffrey Epstein. Yeah, but, but, you know,
[02:17:55.740 --> 02:18:00.700]  in that 40 or 50 pages, I give you a 40 or 50 references that if you want to go
[02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:06.180]  and check it out, you know, feel free, but, you know, mostly Jeffrey Epstein expert,
[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:10.580]  and when people say it's a dream come real, yeah, folks, it's not just Nygaard.
[02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:14.619]  Again, they get surrogates to grow their babies, and that's why they're trying to
[02:18:14.619 --> 02:18:17.780]  come out with these artificial wombs, they've almost got perfected, so you can
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:21.020]  just have a bunch of your own clones grown, and then you're sucking the juice
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:26.980]  out of that. Yeah, absolutely, and as I say, everything is documented, you see all
[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:33.540]  of it, you can go to the sources, and it's, it's amazing how much is out there if
[02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:39.100]  you just go look for it, and 80 to 90 percent of the references are from what
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:43.380]  people would consider mainstream media sources, like New York Times, Washington
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:48.340]  Post, CNN, and it's because that what I've learned about the mainstream media
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:55.100]  is they will usually tell you the truth a couple years later, or buried at
[02:18:55.100 --> 02:19:00.860]  paragraph 45 of a long article. Why do they cover their tracks like that?
[02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:03.700]  Because they'll, when a story's big and pertinent and matters, they cover it up, and then
[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:08.540]  later admit it. Yeah, absolutely, and like last year they said there's no bio labs,
[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:11.980]  that's a made-up thing, and then this year they go, okay, we run bio labs in Ukraine.
[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:17.700]  Yeah, yeah, and so you, it's, it's for those who may not have heard your message,
[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:23.380]  this is a great vehicle to get it out, because it's in book form for those who,
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:29.900]  you know, you may run a little bit hot, this is cool, and you know, I think it's
[02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:34.300]  really gonna be great for those people who are your fans, and those people who
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:38.220]  are really not familiar with you. Absolutely, so if you go to InfoWars.com,
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:41.220]  we'll put a link under the live show feed, it's also a post there, you can find
[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:47.820]  a link right to Amazon to get The Great Reset, The Great Awakening, and the, well
[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:50.780]  there's that one right there, The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist, and
[02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:55.780]  Launching the Next Great Renaissance. Alex Jones will get heckin' lively, and so
[02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:59.380]  there it is, very, very important. I hope you'll get it, and drive it to number one,
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:03.540]  plus it's a great book to give to friends and families, and we'll get more
[02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:06.540]  into it. I want to take some phone calls, because these are all on topic about this.
[02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:10.860]  I want to go to Jordan, and Moose, and James, and Ben, and BattleCry, and Samuel,
[02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:15.340]  and Robert before this hour ends, but pulling back and looking at Trump, you
[02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:17.980]  were asking me this at lunch yesterday, and I gave you my opinion, and I want
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:24.060]  yours. I mean, he did win the last election, he's polling 75% against the
[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:27.860]  other Republicans, he's 30 points ahead of Biden in many polls, 20 at least. I've
[02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:31.820]  never seen a president, current or former, with numbers like this. This is
[02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:35.619]  definitely blown up in the system's face, so regardless of whether Trump's a good
[02:20:35.619 --> 02:20:39.980]  guy or not, which I think overall he is a good guy, he's big-headed, the system's
[02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:43.180]  coming after him, it's only making him more popular, this is going to be
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:48.140]  spectacularly dangerous. I mean, this is crazy. Yeah, I described the moment we're
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:52.780]  living in as, imagine back to your high school, okay, your high school was run by
[02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:57.740]  the student council, maybe the football players had, you know, a lot of influence
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.220]  into how the school went, and suddenly the principal comes and says, the school
[02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:06.260]  is going to be run by the chess club, okay? Now, the chess club, they can be fine
[02:21:06.300 --> 02:21:11.300]  people, they just don't know how to run a school, and the globalists seem to me
[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:16.220]  like the chess club of your high school, okay? They're nerdy. Except they want to
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:19.460]  drink your children's blood. Except they want to drink your children's blood. But
[02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:25.940]  the problem that the globalists have is their plans are spectacularly stupid and
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:31.300]  unpopular. So the reason, as I told you at lunch the other day, the reason the
[02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:38.220]  censorship is so extreme is because our message is so powerful and popular. That's
[02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:42.300]  right, but instead they double down, we talked about that last hour. So the ESG's
[02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:47.260]  are in trouble, so they just accelerate all these other operations. But they
[02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:54.140]  are dancing as fast as they can, and now that the game is up, we've pulled the
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:22:00.740]  curtain back so much that people are seeing the lies. Perfect example,
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:06.780]  Indiana Jones, the new Indiana Jones movie, kind of a woke piece of crud, and
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:11.940]  what happened in the week before it? The filmmakers were rushing out saying, no,
[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:16.580]  no, it's not woke, it's not woke. Well, it's woke, and you know, Disney movie.
[02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:20.020]  Whoever thought you would bet against Disney movies, you know, that they lost
[02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:23.619]  nine hundred million dollars in their past. People aren't just
[02:22:23.619 --> 02:22:27.660]  rejecting it, they've developed an allergy. Yeah, absolutely, and you know,
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:33.060]  look at The Sound of Freedom, perfect example. There's a movie that, I
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:37.180]  think it's still number one. Yeah, yeah, and you know, it's going up against Tom
[02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:41.980]  Cruise. And when they demonize it, it makes it more popular. Yeah, so hadn't the
[02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:48.580]  globalists figured out, people don't like you. You're ugly and you're stupid, okay?
[02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:54.260]  And so anytime... What's the term, Christina, the member of the EU
[02:22:54.260 --> 02:23:01.020]  Parliament, Christina Anderson, she used a term for it, and I looked the term up, I'd
[02:23:01.020 --> 02:23:03.780]  heard it before, but I forgot it. What's the term where someone hates people and hates
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:12.380]  humanity? I want to say misogynist, but that's just against women.
[02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:19.060]  A misanthropic. Misanthropic. Yeah. Yeah, and she, so you're better than me at
[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:23.300]  vocabulary, that's good. But that's, they're misanthropes, I think is the word. Go
[02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:33.100]  ahead and play the clip for her. It's early on in the clip, here it is. It's clip
[02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:40.780]  seven, guys. Because an unelected body like WHO, who is controlled and run by
[02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:47.420]  multi-billionaires, should never be allowed to act in place of a
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:57.380]  democratically elected government. They will be exposed, each and every one of
[02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:03.700]  them, by name. Because guess what? There is elections coming up, and the people
[02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:09.660]  might be interested in who is responsible for the abolition of
[02:24:09.660 --> 02:24:12.660]  democracy.
[02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:29.100]  Misanthropic, let's pull the definition up. The fight is on. For coming today, and
[02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:33.500]  thank you, Misla, for really putting in the work. That's good, the full video is on
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:36.380]  Infowars.com, but let's put the quote back up, because I was looking for that
[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:40.380]  word. It's a misanthrope, and then if someone is anti-human, they're
[02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:45.300]  misanthropic. Instead of being a philanthropist, I guess. It's kind of the
[02:24:45.300 --> 02:24:49.700]  opposite. So all these globalists call themselves philanthropists, but really
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:52.940]  they're anti-human. A person who dislikes humankind and avoids human
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:56.900]  society. Scrooge wasn't the mean-spirited misanthrope most of us
[02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:00.580]  believe him to be. Okay, there you go. Let's make sure, as we're finishing the
[02:25:00.580 --> 02:25:04.300]  book right now, the little quotes and stuff, we need the definition of, you can
[02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:09.820]  define a globalist as misanthropic, all right. You're a
[02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:15.420]  misanthrope, Mr. Gates. All right, let's take a phone call here. Jordan in New
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:20.420]  Jersey, thanks for holding on. Joe Biden, The Digital Currency, welcome. Thank you,
[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:26.580]  Alex. I want to move quickly, I know you have a short time. So, you know me, I was
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:31.260]  the guy I called about the encephalitis and the, you know, that whole call that
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:36.580]  got put on your show. And I run a site called CoronaEyes.com for over a
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:42.540]  year now. And I just want to remind everybody about Biden's executive order
[02:25:42.540 --> 02:25:47.140]  trying to get, ensuring the responsible development of digital currency, order
[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:55.540]  14067. This is also in conjunction with executive order 14081, advancing
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:59.900]  biotechnology and biomanufacturing. Now, it would be interesting for everybody to
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:04.260]  note that Dick Sullivan basically is involved in both of these efforts, almost
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:08.980]  solely, given extreme power never seen before. And I remember you, you're a
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:13.540]  big pharma guy. Yes, that's right. I work for two major
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:17.860]  companies. So talk to me like you're five years old. What do you say they're up to now?
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:28.380]  Okay, so I just want to also reference this. The Gateway Pundit put on this
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:32.660]  whole thing about Fauci issuing 26 billion dollars of taxpayer money, and he
[02:26:32.660 --> 02:26:37.900]  wasn't actually acting as any government authority. He used it for big
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:42.380]  pharma and his buddies, and to buy people off. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But the thing is
[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:45.500]  is that this is where they were spending all the money that caused the whole
[02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:51.700]  thing. So the next big move for them includes bringing in additional currency,
[02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:55.619]  but also forwarding all the biotechnology that they got through the COVID
[02:26:55.619 --> 02:26:59.619]  scam. All right, that wasn't just to kill a bunch of people, and I know you and I
[02:26:59.619 --> 02:27:04.700]  have disagreed on this in the past, but to control and forward their transhumanist
[02:27:04.700 --> 02:27:09.619]  agenda. No, I think they're doing pure research for life extension through
[02:27:09.619 --> 02:27:13.500]  this, as well as killing people. You say we disagree. I believe they're looking for
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:19.020]  the Lazarus gene, or this whole project is about turning us into guinea pigs.
[02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:22.980]  That too, but I also think they're going to use this as a commodity, meaning that the
[02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:26.619]  whole Internet of Bodies and things and what-have-you also means that biological
[02:27:26.619 --> 02:27:30.500]  computing is on the table. And when Biden comes out and you have these groups
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:35.300]  talking about cognitive infrastructure, they're referring directly to
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:39.380]  what will become the hive mind, in my opinion. That's where my research goes.
[02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:43.180]  I urge everybody to go back on my site and look at some of it. And Charles
[02:27:43.180 --> 02:27:47.780]  Lieber, who's sitting in under house arrest in his house right now, hasn't been
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:51.619]  interviewed at all by anybody, and I urge you to try to get news people to go and
[02:27:51.619 --> 02:27:58.420]  inquire with him as to the other aspect of this whole COVID situation, which
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:02.780]  was not only just the book. Are you talking about the Harvard biology head?
[02:28:02.780 --> 02:28:08.580]  He was a former chair of chemistry at Harvard, yes, correct. Okay. And then he was
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:12.180]  supposedly selling to the Chinese. Yeah, the whole thing's really suspicious. Very
[02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:14.740]  interesting. No, I mean, I know this is about Internet of Humans, Internet of
[02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:19.340]  Bodies, smart dust. I mean, that's their big grand super plan is to make us all
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:24.340]  be forced into being guinea pigs in the new social credit score. I totally agree
[02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:27.300]  with you. So I don't know where you say that I don't believe is turning us into a
[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:30.460]  commodity. I mean, I believe that's what this whole thing's about. I appreciate
[02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:34.020]  your call. You want to comment on that? Nope. We got to go to break. So, all right,
[02:28:34.020 --> 02:28:39.940]  we're gonna come back and talk to Ben, James, everybody else. Kent is our guest.
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:46.940]  Kent Peckin lively. And you can get the new book right now at info or store.com

[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:05.380]  lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are going to

[02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:49.780]  procrastinate. This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:53.340]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water
[02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:57.580]  supply. In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride. You wanted
[02:29:57.580 --> 02:30:01.100]  to plug Rainforest. Do you like Rainforest? Yeah, so my name is Ken
[02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:05.260]  Hacken-Ladley. How do I write all the books that I do four books with Dr. Judy
[02:30:05.260 --> 02:30:08.780]  Mikebits, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now two
[02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:14.660]  books with Alex Jones. That's because I use Rainforest every day. What I always
[02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:18.980]  need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning. And so, you know, I try
[02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:23.660]  to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing that I have really
[02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:28.820]  found that makes a difference is Rainforest. I'll take Rainforest in the
[02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:32.860]  morning, right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four
[02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:37.100]  or five hours, writing a whole lot of stuff. So it really is true that
[02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:40.820]  Rainforest is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:43.900]  All right, we love you. We'll be right back. Get your Rainforest Plus,

[02:30:57.220 --> 02:31:01.940]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWarsTore at InfoWars Life, not at a

[02:31:51.900 --> 02:32:02.619]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride
[02:32:02.619 --> 02:32:06.700]  gases into the atmosphere. The surrounding communities began to get
[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:12.460]  sick. Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to
[02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:17.220]  convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid. Still highly toxic, but
[02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:21.900]  containable. Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison, and there was
[02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:25.740]  no affordable way to dispose of it. Lucky for them, one of their major
[02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:30.460]  stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury, who was responsible for the
[02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:35.780]  public health service at the time. And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying
[02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:40.700]  this toxic, untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking
[02:32:40.700 --> 02:32:45.540]  water. Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other
[02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:50.500]  diseases. With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water, and a
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:55.820]  remedy to this madness. Available now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:59.060 --> 02:33:05.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:24.580]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:26.580]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:26.580 --> 02:33:32.780]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:38.860]  All right, Kent Heckenleiberly is in the studio with us, co-author with me on The Great Awakening
[02:33:38.860 --> 02:33:42.060]  book, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:33:42.060 --> 02:33:47.060]  We're going to be taking your phone calls here in just a few minutes, but Kent, let's
[02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:48.660]  get more into the big picture.
[02:33:48.660 --> 02:33:50.940]  What do you think is going to happen with Joe Biden?
[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:56.060]  I mean, he was having major cognitive problems when he stole the election three years ago,
[02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:58.180]  but now he doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:02.740]  Yeah, I think five, six months from now, what's going to happen is there's going to be a
[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:09.140]  some problem, maybe a CPAP machine isn't working, and he's going to say he really
[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:13.780]  wanted to run, but he's stepping down, and then they're going to put my governor, Gavin
[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:17.500]  Newsom, in there, and they're going to try to run the table.
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:21.539]  Hopefully Robert Kennedy Jr. messes that scenario up.
[02:34:21.539 --> 02:34:29.460]  But I think one way or another, America is going to reassert itself in 2024, and if they
[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:34.500]  try to steal the election like they did before, there are going to be consequences, and they're
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:36.740]  going to be severe.
[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:38.220]  What do you think of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?
[02:34:38.220 --> 02:34:41.140]  We've got a caller we'll go to in a moment, Moose in Maryland.
[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:44.100]  He thinks he's a Trojan horse, or ask that question.
[02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:47.699]  You know, I've worked with Robert Kennedy for several years.
[02:34:47.699 --> 02:34:49.820]  I believe in him.
[02:34:49.820 --> 02:34:53.020]  I have not seen any sign of deception.
[02:34:53.020 --> 02:34:57.580]  I think that in his presidential run, he's shown himself to be a person of integrity,
[02:34:57.619 --> 02:35:01.860]  and, you know, in the final analysis, people are known by their fruits, and, you know,
[02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:07.539]  the way the mainstream media attacked Kennedy for being, for making the correct scientific
[02:35:07.539 --> 02:35:13.980]  observation that COVID affects different ethnic groups differently, and then attacking him
[02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:21.020]  as anti-Semitic only reinforces to me that, like Trump, they see him as a threat to the
[02:35:21.020 --> 02:35:22.020]  system.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:23.380]  I mean, I agree.
[02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:26.140]  And they murdered his father when he was winning primaries.
[02:35:26.140 --> 02:35:28.420]  He was going to be the presidential nominee.
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:29.420]  They murdered his uncle.
[02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:33.260]  I mean, people talk about Trump having a chip on his shoulder because of the way he's been
[02:35:33.260 --> 02:35:35.420]  persecuted and being more hardcore.
[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:36.660]  Imagine being this guy.
[02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:42.500]  Yeah, and what I, what he has said over the years, because I am a member of the vaccine
[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:49.900]  injured community, is he has said for several years that he will die with his boots on defending
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:51.340]  our children.
[02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:53.740]  He has shown that he will do that.
[02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:55.539]  I believe he's a man of integrity.
[02:35:55.539 --> 02:35:57.740]  I don't agree with everything he has said.
[02:35:57.740 --> 02:36:00.940]  I think there are some positions he needs to change.
[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:09.380]  But I really want, and I'm more of a conservative, but I really want to have a liberal side
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:14.740]  of the American equation that will have a conversation with the conservative side.
[02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:16.539]  And he is that person.
[02:36:16.539 --> 02:36:21.220]  I got to be honest, if he was the Democrat nominee, I would have trouble not voting for
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:24.060]  him over Trump just because of the vaccine issue.
[02:36:24.060 --> 02:36:25.460]  And listen, let's be clear.
[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:29.720]  He had a real integrity 20 years ago, being the leading environmentalist, ending toxic
[02:36:29.720 --> 02:36:34.820]  waste dumps and chemicals in the water and serious stuff, OK?
[02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:43.860]  So in, say, 2003, I would say he was a man of integrity, like Trump said, a real guy,
[02:36:43.860 --> 02:36:44.860]  not a fraud.
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:45.860]  Right.
[02:36:45.860 --> 02:36:46.860]  OK, overhead shot, please.
[02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:57.340]  In 2023, OK, if here's where Alex Jones is, a populist, pro-human, anti-globalist.
[02:36:57.340 --> 02:36:59.180]  And then here's where Kennedy was back then.
[02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:00.780]  He was still a guy of integrity.
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:02.180]  He's moved all the way to where I am.
[02:37:02.180 --> 02:37:05.699]  I mean, if you look at his statements today, we don't need to take the guns.
[02:37:05.699 --> 02:37:07.100]  It's a psychiatric thing.
[02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:10.940]  Almost all the shooters are on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:12.060]  We don't need to have an open border.
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:15.619]  It's human smuggling used by big corporations and child sex trafficking.
[02:37:15.619 --> 02:37:18.220]  They're bringing in a permanent underclass they can exploit totally.
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:19.220]  That's what I say.
[02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:20.220]  Word for word.
[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:21.220]  But it's true.
[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:22.220]  I'm not saying he's copying me.
[02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:25.900]  I mean, it's like on every issue now he's saying exactly the right thing.
[02:37:25.900 --> 02:37:28.820]  So he is the ultimate Trojan horse that didn't care.
[02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:30.780]  They murdered his father for being good.
[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:31.780]  Didn't care.
[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:32.780]  They murdered his uncle for being good.
[02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:33.780]  Trying to leave Vietnam.
[02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:34.780]  I mean, it doesn't.
[02:37:34.780 --> 02:37:35.780]  The dog doesn't hunt.
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:37.780]  You murder my dad, my uncle.
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:40.740]  And by the way, all the rest of Kennedy's don't care about him or they're mad at him.
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:42.539]  I know people in the Kennedy group.
[02:37:42.539 --> 02:37:43.539]  OK.
[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:46.740]  I know John Lennon's widow and son and stuff like that.
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:48.100]  Folks, let me just say something.
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:53.820]  The heat the FBI put on the Kennedys after they murdered the dad and then the uncle, which
[02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:59.420]  is the first the uncle, the dad of it's from RFK's junior perspective, is incredible.
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:01.180]  The rest of the family's captured.
[02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:02.180]  Yeah.
[02:38:02.180 --> 02:38:06.619]  The rest of the family's controlled after they murder John Lennon, after they murder
[02:38:06.619 --> 02:38:10.220]  RFK, JFK or other prominent people like that they were scared of.
[02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:13.140]  They then come after their families and try to bully them into submission.
[02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:14.780]  So that's what you got to understand.
[02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:18.260]  There's no way RFK Jr. is one of them.
[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:19.740]  There's just it does not compute.
[02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:20.740]  Yeah.
[02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:24.660]  And one of the things that had been an issue for me is, you know, that his environmentalism
[02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:28.500]  because, you know, I'm a conservative and I hear the word environmentalist and I think,
[02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:29.500]  OK, somebody wants to.
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:31.420]  He says it's a giant carbon tax to grab power.
[02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:32.420]  Stop.
[02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:33.420]  I'll develop.
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:34.420]  Go ahead.
[02:38:34.420 --> 02:38:37.780]  But, you know, what he talks about is he's not that kind of environmentalist because
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:42.420]  what he wants is a healthy ecosystem so that people can benefit from it.
[02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:47.060]  So the people he works for are the blue collar people like the fishermen of the Hudson River
[02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:48.500]  and the Hudson Valley.
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:53.380]  And so he works with them to restore the fisheries so that they can continue it.
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:56.699]  So he is a different kind of environmentalist.
[02:38:56.699 --> 02:39:01.020]  He gets in trouble with the environmentalist groups because he says, yes, we have we need
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:04.500]  to have development, but we need to make sure we have a clean environment.
[02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:06.500]  I'm in favor of a clean environment.
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:13.260]  And so I and so the way in which he solves problems is the way which I think is the American
[02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:16.340]  experience, which is we should talk to each other.
[02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:23.340]  We should try to find ways in which we can agree to a real consensus instead of the U.N.
[02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:24.340]  ramming it on our throat.
[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:25.340]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:30.100]  And so and I love that he talks about how all the other Democrats talk about let's end
[02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:31.100]  the polarization.
[02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:32.980]  Well, are you going to talk to the other side?
[02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:33.980]  No.
[02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:39.460]  Well, let's expand on that because I interrupted you because I forgot the other good thing.
[02:39:39.460 --> 02:39:41.820]  He came out and said, I'm a real environmentalist.
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:46.780]  I don't want toxic waste or overfishing or all this or just clearcutting for no reason.
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:52.980]  But he said that the Vanguard and BlackRock are running all this to take control and consolidate
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:55.380]  power and starve the third world.
[02:39:55.380 --> 02:39:58.340]  And modern environmentalism and carbon taxes are a fraud.
[02:39:58.340 --> 02:40:02.660]  So he's attacking the fact that these big corporations claim the mantle of the earth
[02:40:02.660 --> 02:40:06.100]  and then set up a horrible fascist regime through it.
[02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:13.020]  And aren't you so happy to see a public figure who will say that they were wrong about something?
[02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:17.420]  So RFK was asked about, you know, the whole Russiagate scandal.
[02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:22.539]  And he said, gee, you know, when it came up in 2016, 2017, I thought, oh, well, probably,
[02:40:22.539 --> 02:40:23.860]  you know, there's something there.
[02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:28.539]  And then he said, you know, in 2020, when Covid hit and they called Kennedy a Russian
[02:40:28.539 --> 02:40:31.820]  agent, he was like, oh, that's the play.
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:34.900]  And he said, then he looked into it and he's like, no.
[02:40:34.900 --> 02:40:40.420]  So isn't it just so refreshing to have a public figure who will say, hey, I thought the wrong
[02:40:40.420 --> 02:40:41.420]  thing.
[02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:46.580]  Some people and he had dinner with Oliver Stone and his son, Sean, and they were telling
[02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:48.780]  him this stuff in 2019.
[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:53.539]  And so isn't it wonderful to have a public figure who can change his mind?
[02:40:53.539 --> 02:40:55.140]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:40:55.140 --> 02:40:56.420]  We're not putting all our hopes on him.
[02:40:56.420 --> 02:40:58.460]  We're not saying we totally trust him.
[02:40:58.460 --> 02:41:00.940]  This would verify whether he's good or bad.
[02:41:00.940 --> 02:41:04.260]  And I think he means well, he has some mistakes like Trump.
[02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:10.580]  He's sounding like Alex Jones and Kent Hebenleible, because that's the way the future is working.
[02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:11.580]  People are awake now.
[02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:12.580]  They get the new world order.
[02:41:12.580 --> 02:41:15.300]  Let's go to a caller, though, who may may disagree, which is fine.
[02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:16.300]  Moose in Maryland.
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:17.300]  What's your view on RFK Jr.?
[02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:18.300]  Go ahead.
[02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:19.300]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:20.300]  Good, brother.
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:21.300]  I'm a first time.
[02:41:21.300 --> 02:41:22.300]  I'm a first time caller.
[02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:26.820]  I just wanted to give a shout out to my buddy Nelson.
[02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:29.619]  He actually turned me on to you.
[02:41:29.619 --> 02:41:33.020]  And it's only been about probably eight months since I've been red pilled, man.
[02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:36.140]  And I just wanted to say thank you to him.
[02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:45.180]  But as far as RFK goes, I watched a piece that Pete Santilli did on RFK.
[02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:47.220]  And it was about him being a Trojan horse.
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:50.380]  He put out a piece on Bandit video.
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:51.380]  Have you happened to see that?
[02:41:51.380 --> 02:41:53.220]  Or have you seen that piece that he did?
[02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:54.220]  No, I haven't.
[02:41:54.220 --> 02:41:55.740]  But maybe I should get Pete on.
[02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:58.060]  What did he say?
[02:41:58.060 --> 02:42:03.660]  I think, well, it's about him being because, you know, RFK was a lawyer.
[02:42:03.660 --> 02:42:08.860]  And the way he laid it out, he had all documentation and it was showing where he was, you know,
[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:14.580]  he was an environmentalist, but he was a big lawyer for all these these leftist groups.
[02:42:14.580 --> 02:42:16.740]  And it was just it was very compelling, man.
[02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:17.740]  It had me.
[02:42:17.740 --> 02:42:20.260]  I mean, I think we know that RFK Jr. has been a big liberal.
[02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:22.100]  I don't think that's a secret.
[02:42:22.100 --> 02:42:23.100]  Yeah.
[02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:24.100]  Yeah.
[02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:25.100]  I mean, it was in my eyes, man.
[02:42:25.100 --> 02:42:32.220]  And then it was saying that it all led back to the LGBT, U.S., V, W, X, Y, Z people.
[02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:34.539]  And it was just it was kind of an eye opener.
[02:42:34.539 --> 02:42:38.700]  I'm not saying that he is a Trojan horse, but I wanted to get your take on it.
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:41.820]  If you actually had seen that piece that Pete Santilli did.
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:45.619]  Well, I mean, I can tell you that, no, I haven't seen the piece, but it's a Bandit video.
[02:42:45.619 --> 02:42:48.180]  People should go look at it on his page.
[02:42:48.180 --> 02:42:51.260]  I think it's healthy to ask questions, healthy to investigate.
[02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:54.700]  But I mean, the establishment legitimately doesn't like Trump or RFK Jr.
[02:42:54.700 --> 02:42:57.140]  I mean, they're not faking that.
[02:42:57.140 --> 02:42:58.420]  They're pulling out all the stops.
[02:42:58.420 --> 02:42:59.420]  They're censoring them.
[02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:00.420]  They're doing it all.
[02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:01.420]  What do you think?
[02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:02.420]  Yeah.
[02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:03.860]  So, Moose, I agree with Alex.
[02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:10.860]  I want all of our politicians not just to be vetted once and done, keep doing it.
[02:43:10.860 --> 02:43:16.060]  From my experiences with Robert Kennedy and the people around him, I believe he is genuine.
[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:17.220]  I think he's a real fighter.
[02:43:17.220 --> 02:43:22.420]  I think he's in that tradition of the classic Democrat who believes.
[02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:25.660]  How do you serve the new order when they kill your dad and uncle?
[02:43:25.660 --> 02:43:26.660]  Yeah.
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:27.660]  Yeah.
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:33.260]  So I take him at his word when he says this is something he'll die with his boots on and
[02:43:33.260 --> 02:43:34.580]  there are worse things than death.
[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:41.260]  I mean, you know, how can you have your father assassinated under those circumstances?
[02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:42.260]  And he was there.
[02:43:42.260 --> 02:43:43.539]  He saw it happen.
[02:43:43.539 --> 02:43:48.140]  And then he was there when he died.
[02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:54.140]  And how can you, how can it not affect you?
[02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:59.320]  And everything that he has done, his investigations, I've spent a lot of time going deep into his
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:03.020]  investigations and, you know, having some of my own views change.
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:10.820]  So I believe that Kennedy is somebody who will keep the American experiment going where I
[02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:15.500]  think Biden wants to put an end to the American experiment.
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:20.619]  Well, obviously, Obama does not want RFK Jr.
[02:44:20.619 --> 02:44:23.700]  And I think there's a lot of evidence they killed JFK Jr.
[02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:28.100]  And so I don't get like the stars, my eyes and Camelot and all the rest of it is Kennedy
[02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:29.740]  had his own issues.
[02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:34.380]  But his dad definitely went up against the mob in the system.
[02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:35.380]  Yeah.
[02:44:35.380 --> 02:44:39.100]  I mean, Bobby Kennedy was even more hardcore than his brother.
[02:44:39.100 --> 02:44:44.140]  And so, again, I'm not putting my eggs in that basket or Trump's, quite frankly.
[02:44:44.140 --> 02:44:49.660]  In fact, if I had to look at it, I think Kennedy and Trump are a dead heat in my mind.
[02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:52.860]  But I can tell you, both men are mavericks.
[02:44:52.860 --> 02:44:54.539]  Nobody's telling him what to do.
[02:44:54.539 --> 02:44:57.779]  And that's why the globalists don't like him, because they are in charge.
[02:44:57.779 --> 02:44:58.779]  Just like me.
[02:44:58.779 --> 02:44:59.779]  I imagine you can't.
[02:44:59.779 --> 02:45:02.140]  I mean, I know Joe Rogan, I know Carlson.
[02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:04.220]  These guys are all their own man.
[02:45:04.220 --> 02:45:05.220]  You're not.
[02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:06.380]  There's nobody calling me up saying you better.
[02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:10.860]  I mean, most of these other talk show hosts and politicians have somebody that handles
[02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:11.860]  them.
[02:45:11.860 --> 02:45:12.860]  There's no handler here.
[02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:14.060]  Sometimes I think there should be.
[02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:16.539]  But the point is, no, there's not.
[02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:20.220]  As his co-author, let me tell you, there is no other person.
[02:45:20.220 --> 02:45:21.660]  There is no one.
[02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:24.260]  And the point is, that's what the system doesn't like.
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:25.260]  Yeah.
[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:26.260]  Yeah.
[02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:30.740]  Because the American experiment is about independence and free thought.
[02:45:30.740 --> 02:45:32.460]  So I don't even have a secretary.
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:35.920]  So you need one.
[02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:42.119]  So everybody, I am so much in favor of those who are, they're independent thinkers.
[02:45:42.119 --> 02:45:46.960]  I think Vivek Ramaswamy, we just got to say he's super articulate like him.
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:51.080]  You know, I think there's going to be a President Ramaswamy someday.
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:53.039]  I just don't want it to be yet.
[02:45:53.039 --> 02:45:54.760]  I still think he's too young.
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:46:00.080]  So I just think there's some people say, well, he was a young global leader.
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:02.400]  They scoop up everybody that's good.
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:04.700]  The question is, has he now been fighting him for a long time?
[02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:05.700]  That's the answer.
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:10.700]  I mean, people look at it and they go, oh, you know, this person once worked for this.
[02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:13.180]  Well, we've got to be ready to have them defect to us.
[02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:14.180]  Well, yeah.
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:18.619]  And this is something that I found in the 12 books that I published, because I usually
[02:46:18.619 --> 02:46:22.220]  work with the defectors, the people who become whistleblowers.
[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:29.100]  And, you know, I love nothing more than to find somebody who used to work for Merck as
[02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:35.980]  a pharmaceutical representative and who tells me from the inside how they psychologically
[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:40.360]  manipulate their drug salesmen.
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:43.320]  You know, they bring them in, they give them all the science.
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:46.300]  They make them feel that they're not a salesperson.
[02:46:46.300 --> 02:46:48.460]  They're not a drug pusher.
[02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:51.060]  They're giving scientific information.
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:59.500]  And so we have to be open to the defectors because the defectors, the people who are
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:08.020]  inside these large organizations, are going to be the people who give us the best intelligence.
[02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:11.779]  And I can tell you, in the Cold War, they would have fake defectors on both sides.
[02:47:11.779 --> 02:47:15.140]  Like Lee Harvey Oswald was a fake defector of the Soviet Union.
[02:47:15.140 --> 02:47:17.660]  Under the globalist model, they don't want any defectors.
[02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:20.460]  They'll put infiltrators in you, but not via a defector.
[02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:23.460]  They don't ever have one of their people come to you and tell you all this knowledge and
[02:47:23.460 --> 02:47:24.460]  then become an operative.
[02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:26.460]  They just try to get their people hired.
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:28.100]  They don't do the defector deal.
[02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:30.660]  These are real people leaving and blowing the whistle.
[02:47:30.660 --> 02:47:31.660]  Yeah.
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:36.380]  And since I've dealt with these defectors, these whistleblowers, I know that the pain
[02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:41.860]  that they go through, the difficulty they go through, I mean, I hear some commentators
[02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:45.500]  talk about like, oh, you know, if you become a whistleblower, you're going to become rich.
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:48.500]  No, you don't become rich being a whistleblower.
[02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:53.619]  Yeah, you lose your job, you get sued by the feds, and then a go fund me maybe raises 50
[02:47:53.619 --> 02:47:54.619]  grand.
[02:47:54.619 --> 02:47:55.619]  That pays the lawyer for two months.
[02:47:55.619 --> 02:47:56.619]  Yeah.
[02:47:56.619 --> 02:47:57.619]  Yeah.
[02:47:57.619 --> 02:48:00.700]  You become poor, but you become powerful and you have integrity.
[02:48:00.700 --> 02:48:02.660]  Well, and then there's a tipping point.
[02:48:02.660 --> 02:48:05.860]  And I think we've already passed the critical mass, the tipping point.
[02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:06.860]  That's why it's crazy.
[02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:10.740]  The globalists still have the power and control over media and government, but they have little
[02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:11.740]  else.
[02:48:11.740 --> 02:48:13.700]  Jay Dyer sent me a photo earlier.
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:17.700]  He's in Los Angeles, got invited to speak at some deal by a women's group.
[02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:18.900]  And he told me this photo.
[02:48:18.900 --> 02:48:25.980]  He sent me like 200 women he took from the podium, young, well-to-do, attractive women
[02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:31.140]  fawning all over him and his anti-New World Order asking about Alex Jones.
[02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:32.700]  And the point is, it's not bragging.
[02:48:32.700 --> 02:48:37.220]  It's saying when you're in L.A. in Beverly Hills and the young, rich women all want to
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:42.500]  know about Jay Dyer and Alex Jones, it shows that the system's not cool at all.
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:47.140]  Hollywood, you know, I saw Barry Diller was saying, if they don't fix this strike, Hollywood's
[02:48:47.140 --> 02:48:48.140]  dead.
[02:48:48.140 --> 02:48:49.140]  It's already dead.
[02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:50.779]  So it's not that I'm that cool.
[02:48:50.779 --> 02:48:52.300]  It's that they're that uncool.
[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:53.300]  Absolutely.
[02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:54.300]  100%.
[02:48:54.300 --> 02:48:57.740]  So how do they try to resurrect themselves?
[02:48:57.740 --> 02:48:59.460]  I don't see how they do it.
[02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:02.740]  It's like the chess club trying to convince you they're popular.
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:05.340]  It just ain't going to happen.
[02:49:05.340 --> 02:49:08.380]  So what do they do?
[02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:10.220]  They're going to try to do a number of things.
[02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:14.920]  But I think with, you know, when people wake up, they don't go back to being asleep.
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:17.520]  So you've been doing a great job waking people up.
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:18.520]  I've been doing it.
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:19.920]  A lot of other people have been doing it.
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:20.920]  It's successful.
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:25.720]  So those 200 women who are at that, you know, event in Beverly Hills, they're just going
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:26.720]  to keep growing.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:31.960]  Well, his point was, is that that's he travels the country.
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:33.560]  That's all he's getting is love.
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:35.360]  And I mean, I was getting a lot of hate five years ago.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:37.840]  I was still a minority, but it's like no hate now.
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:38.840]  Yeah, I know.
[02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:41.400]  I went out to lunch with you yesterday at a very public place.
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:44.640]  And so many people were just looking at you smiling.
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:48.520]  It was, you know, really interesting to see.
[02:49:48.520 --> 02:49:52.240]  But that's what I'm saying is, I don't think the globalists in their ivory towers realize
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:53.560]  how screwed they are.
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:54.560]  Yeah.
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:56.920]  And let's not let them know.
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.039]  I don't think I mean, I kind of want to let them know.
[02:49:59.039 --> 02:50:00.080]  So they back off.
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:01.960]  Is there any way for them to sue for peace?
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:05.039]  Like they didn't kill Napoleon the first or second time.
[02:50:05.039 --> 02:50:06.039]  They put him in absentia.
[02:50:06.039 --> 02:50:11.560]  They, you know, they put him on an island.
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:13.920]  Is there a way to get the globalists to sue for peace or no?
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:16.320]  They're just not going to stop.
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:21.800]  I cannot imagine how I just think it's we're going to have to defeat them like we defeated
[02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:22.800]  the Nazis.
[02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:23.800]  No, boy.
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:26.840]  The problem is they got so many bioweapons they're going to release.
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:28.279]  But the next time I do it, we know it's them.
[02:50:28.279 --> 02:50:32.640]  So, OK, they're going to hoist themselves on their own petard being in Indiana.
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:35.840]  Thanks for holding her on the air with our special guest.
[02:50:35.840 --> 02:50:36.840]  Hello.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:37.840]  Hey, Alex.
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:38.840]  Hey, Ken.
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:41.080]  Thank you guys so much for all that you do.
[02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:47.640]  I just want to and just advocate for, you know, perseverance and resiliency.
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:51.520]  You guys have said I've been a full time listener for about a year now.
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:53.400]  My first time calling into the Alex Jones.
[02:50:53.400 --> 02:50:57.440]  So I've called into the American Journal, but I've been on your product for at least
[02:50:57.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  six months now.
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:50:59.440]  It's totally changed my life.
[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:07.560]  And I just there's a saying there's a Bible verse that says Exodus chapter 14, verse 14.
[02:51:07.560 --> 02:51:11.960]  It says God will give you strength.
[02:51:11.960 --> 02:51:13.480]  All you need to do is be still.
[02:51:13.480 --> 02:51:14.480]  I did that.
[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:15.480]  I'm quoting it.
[02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:17.680]  But I'm just saying you guys are doing an amazing job.
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:19.800]  I'm so thankful for all that you do, Alex.
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:20.800]  God bless you.
[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:22.840]  And Ken, I just got the American reset.
[02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:25.920]  I'm waiting for the American wakening, the Great Awakening.
[02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:26.920]  Thank you so much.
[02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:27.920]  You know, don't hang up.
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:28.920]  You had a question about Trump.
[02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:33.200]  Hey, and I just want to let you know that quote from Exodus is actually in our book.
[02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:34.200]  Oh, wow.
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:35.200]  That's right.
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:36.200]  It is.
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:37.200]  Yeah.
[02:51:37.360 --> 02:51:39.360]  And that's where, again, with Trump.
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:40.360]  That's crazy.
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:41.360]  Hold on.
[02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:42.360]  Let's stop right there.
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:45.360]  We were reading that quote together and talking about it's on faith to go into the desert
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:46.360]  like the Israelites.
[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:48.039]  And he just called in about it.
[02:51:48.039 --> 02:51:49.039]  Yes.
[02:51:49.039 --> 02:51:50.039]  It's one that's crazy.
[02:51:50.039 --> 02:51:51.039]  Sorry, caller.
[02:51:51.039 --> 02:51:53.039]  Go ahead and start over, man.
[02:51:53.039 --> 02:51:54.160]  God works in mysterious ways.
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:57.640]  And I feel like since I've listened to you, I've gotten closer to God.
[02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.640]  My life has changed.
[02:51:58.640 --> 02:52:00.760]  And I feel like it's been hand in hand.
[02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:05.240]  You know, I feel like you guys are some of God's most fierce warriors on earth.
[02:52:05.240 --> 02:52:10.000]  And I with Trump, I just believe that, you know, people need to stop giving him crap.
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  I understand the vaccine.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:15.800]  But at the same time, I feel like he kind of teased bossy to see if he would show his
[02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:20.200]  true colors again, like he did in the 80s, like Dr. Judy Mikovits talked about and everything
[02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:21.200]  like this.
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:23.119]  Again, thank you so much for all that you do.
[02:52:23.119 --> 02:52:27.960]  The product at InfoWars has changed my life and then also the info that you have taught
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:30.119]  me is going to change my family.
[02:52:30.119 --> 02:52:31.720]  We're very thankful for you, sir.
[02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:32.720]  Thank you so much.
[02:52:32.720 --> 02:52:33.720]  Samuel in Colorado.
[02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:34.720]  Thanks for calling.
[02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:46.119]  I just want to talk about Donald Trump and me being a forever trumper and people in my
[02:52:46.119 --> 02:52:54.600]  own family taking the shot in the vaccine and seeing this part of them.
[02:52:54.600 --> 02:53:02.440]  I also wanted to see you on another Russian interview to try to awaken the Russian people.
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:05.920]  I know you're saying the Russian media was bringing you up and all that, but I saw your
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:06.920]  first interview.
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:08.840]  I thought that was very exciting.
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:11.240]  And I think the Russian people are awake.
[02:53:11.240 --> 02:53:13.160]  I think it's cool.
[02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:18.039]  And then one last thing I wanted to talk about was the reset wars.
[02:53:18.039 --> 02:53:25.520]  Me, my brother and my family always talk about God and all this and that.
[02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:32.880]  And I really thought Reset Wars was a really great kind of like documentary about the reality
[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:34.900]  of what we're living.
[02:53:34.900 --> 02:53:38.720]  And so I really wanted to see like a documentary made about that so I can send that out, buy
[02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:43.240]  it and watch it with my family.
[02:53:43.240 --> 02:53:44.720]  And then I'm just a big supporter.
[02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:48.440]  I live here in the Rockies and I scream your name every day.
[02:53:48.440 --> 02:53:50.840]  I wear your hats and your shirts.
[02:53:50.840 --> 02:53:55.440]  And I'm just very, well, I'm very honored you put up with me, brother, because when I
[02:53:55.560 --> 02:53:58.039]  get up here and talk about our success, it's not me.
[02:53:58.039 --> 02:53:59.039]  It's all the guests.
[02:53:59.039 --> 02:54:00.039]  It's all the callers.
[02:54:00.039 --> 02:54:03.360]  I'm just saying the enemy is being hurt on many levels.
[02:54:03.360 --> 02:54:04.880]  They're not all powerful.
[02:54:04.880 --> 02:54:05.880]  Thank you so much, Sam.
[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:06.880]  You want to comment on that?
[02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:09.520]  No, it's just wonderful.
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:13.920]  And you know what I wanted to say from the previous caller talking about fighting, you
[02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:19.520]  know, in December of 2019, I just felt like I needed to rededicate myself to God.
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:23.039]  And what I chose was St. Michael to wear a St. Michael's medallion.
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:29.320]  St. Michael's medallion is the greatest of God's warriors, but he is also the one who
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:32.200]  is supposed to weigh the souls of those going into heaven.
[02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:37.039]  But God gets mad at him because he keeps putting his thumb on the scale, letting too many people
[02:54:37.039 --> 02:54:38.039]  in.
[02:54:38.039 --> 02:54:39.039]  He's compassionate.
[02:54:39.039 --> 02:54:41.119]  And I just think we need to be spiritual warriors.
[02:54:41.119 --> 02:54:43.500]  That's part of what the Great Awakening is.
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:48.920]  It's not just knowing every single fact of what these evil people are doing.
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:53.200]  It's rediscovering our connection to God, using our own discernment.
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:54.960]  And that's in every chapter in the book.
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:59.840]  Wherever we are in the world, the battle is coming to you.
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:02.240]  Maybe a big battle, maybe a small battle.
[02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:06.720]  And what we're asking you to do is when that battle comes to you, to stand up where you
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:07.720]  are.
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:09.880]  You don't have to travel across the country.
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:13.600]  You can fight these battles in your own community.
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:15.160]  Every one of you can be a spiritual warrior.
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:17.119]  And I don't want to say just praying.
[02:55:17.119 --> 02:55:19.200]  That makes it like, oh, it's a little side issue.
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:20.960]  Prayer is number one.
[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:23.800]  Research and spreading the word and supporting the people that tell the truth is the rest
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:24.800]  of it.
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:26.720]  But prayer is first opening up to God.
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:29.920]  People should get the book, The Great Awakening, Defeating the Globalist, and launching the
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:32.880]  next great renaissance by Alex Jones and Kent Heckman Lively.
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:37.000]  It is right now available at Amazon.com exclusively.
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.279]  We've got links on InfoWars.com under the live show feed.
[02:55:40.279 --> 02:55:41.279]  Go there.
[02:55:41.279 --> 02:55:42.720]  And I want to thank you all for sitting to number one.
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:43.720]  That is very important.
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:46.779]  So the bookstores around the country see that number and order the book and we reach a lot
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:48.440]  of new people.
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:49.440]  There's just one more tool in the fight, but I'm very proud of it.
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:51.619]  It's going to be a lot longer than the last book.
[02:55:51.619 --> 02:55:55.140]  The last book was pretty juicy, but this is going to be really juicy.
[02:55:55.140 --> 02:55:56.140]  Let's go to James in Michigan.
[02:55:56.140 --> 02:55:57.140]  You're on the air, James.
[02:55:57.140 --> 02:55:58.140]  Go ahead.
[02:55:58.140 --> 02:55:59.140]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:00.140]  How are you doing, Ken?
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:01.140]  Great.
[02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:02.140]  Congratulations on the book.
[02:56:02.140 --> 02:56:04.660]  I'd like to give you a plug on the Survival Shield X2.
[02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:06.619]  It is very good.
[02:56:06.619 --> 02:56:09.300]  Something just clicked and I'm thinking different.
[02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:10.300]  I'm living different.
[02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:11.300]  I'm getting up earlier.
[02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:14.779]  I don't know what's in this stuff, but it's a bottle of magic.
[02:56:14.779 --> 02:56:18.980]  Well, I want to commend you, James, on having the best phone call, the best phone quality
[02:56:18.980 --> 02:56:19.980]  of the day.
[02:56:19.980 --> 02:56:24.020]  So I'm going to hold you over the next hour, but make a minute and a half point on X2,
[02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:25.020]  which is still sold out.
[02:56:25.020 --> 02:56:26.020]  Pulling my hair out.
[02:56:26.020 --> 02:56:27.460]  But it's going to supposedly end soon.
[02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:29.140]  It's very hard to manufacture.
[02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:31.220]  You got to get a DEA license.
[02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:33.820]  And then they have to, because I mean, the stuff's so pure, you put a drop of it on this
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:35.140]  table, it eats through it.
[02:56:35.140 --> 02:56:36.140]  Okay.
[02:56:36.140 --> 02:56:37.140]  And it looks like I dream of Jeannie.
[02:56:37.140 --> 02:56:38.539]  Purple smoke shoots up.
[02:56:38.539 --> 02:56:40.660]  But that's the only pure stuff that does this incredible.
[02:56:40.660 --> 02:56:41.660]  Nobody else makes this.
[02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:46.420]  Then they got to put it in for like three months in these processors in this special
[02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:48.420]  bath to get it ready.
[02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:50.660]  And then it's DEA allows us to sell it.
[02:56:50.660 --> 02:56:52.340]  It's put into palm oil.
[02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:56.560]  So when we go like picking a Russians, the Russians actually invented this proprietary
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:56:57.560]  way to put atomic.
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:56:59.180]  Everybody else is the atomic iodine.
[02:56:59.180 --> 02:57:00.180]  They don't.
[02:57:00.180 --> 02:57:01.180]  Okay.
[02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:02.260]  This is the only real atomic iodine.
[02:57:02.260 --> 02:57:04.860]  And the weirdos we work with came up with it like 10 years ago.
[02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:11.480]  And then the manufacturing process is so hard that they've been making this batch for six
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:15.840]  months because they've got to be able to spectrometer it and it's got to be absolutely
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:17.480]  transferred over.
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:21.279]  So the stuff is so strong, you're not allowed to ship pure iodine out the door.
[02:57:21.279 --> 02:57:27.279]  So DEA license folks, it's, it's in a, it's in an armored room at the manufacturing facility.
[02:57:27.279 --> 02:57:28.279]  I'm ranting.
[02:57:28.279 --> 02:57:29.279]  Stay there.
[02:57:29.279 --> 02:57:30.279]  Don't hang up, James.
[02:57:30.279 --> 02:57:31.279]  I'm going to come back to you since you got into X2.
[02:57:31.279 --> 02:57:33.360]  By the way, X2, X3 is great too.
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:34.360]  It's almost sold out.
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:35.360]  It has some of that.
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:37.400]  And then the other two types that work in synergy.
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  It's great.
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:39.400]  It's all apples and oranges.
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:47.400]  X2 is not available because they just can't make it for some reason.
[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:53.800]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the insanity,
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:57.000]  the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.320]  You are crazy in my view if you don't get high quality, affordable food and water filtration
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:02.320]  and self-defense.
[02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:04.480]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:06.920]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:09.039]  And I preach to the choir on that.
[02:58:09.080 --> 02:58:13.960]  A lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[02:58:13.960 --> 02:58:15.600]  This is something you need now.
[02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:20.160]  And we've got it in the food department and in the high quality water filtration department.
[02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:24.400]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:25.960]  and still get quality.
[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:31.640]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on
[02:58:31.640 --> 02:58:33.800]  water and air filtration.
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:36.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:37.760]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:38.760]  Get 10% off.
[02:58:38.760 --> 02:58:39.760]  It's an insane deal.
[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:40.760]  For a limited time.
[02:58:40.760 --> 02:58:45.760]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[02:58:45.760 --> 02:58:48.680]  Hey everybody, Rodney Outbound here.
[02:58:48.680 --> 02:58:54.119]  I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering scholarships to River University.
[02:58:54.119 --> 02:58:59.880]  Maybe you're watching Infowars today and you don't know what to do with the problems that
[02:58:59.880 --> 02:59:01.760]  we face in the world today.
[02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:06.400]  You've been through COVID 19, 2019, 2021, 22, 23.
[02:59:06.840 --> 02:59:11.800]  Here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how
[02:59:11.800 --> 02:59:13.279]  to deal with it.
[02:59:13.279 --> 02:59:16.440]  Come a full three year bachelor degree.
[02:59:16.440 --> 02:59:22.160]  We'll train you up in ministry, government, worship that you can go out and actually bring
[02:59:22.160 --> 02:59:24.720]  about a transformation in the earth today.
[02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:29.119]  We have graduates going all over the world from the Arctic to the outback.
[02:59:29.119 --> 02:59:31.279]  And right here, this is what we do.
[02:59:31.279 --> 02:59:36.920]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for transformation.
[02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:38.119]  And that's what you'll do.
[02:59:38.119 --> 02:59:44.560]  So scan the QR code right now or go to riveruniversity.org and get the free scholarship offered to you
[02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:45.080]  by Infowars.
[02:59:46.700 --> 02:59:55.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:57.700 --> 03:00:02.700]  For what is a man?
[03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:05.700]  What has he got?
[03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:08.700]  If not himself
[03:00:08.700 --> 03:00:11.700]  Then he has naught
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:15.700]  To say the things
[03:00:15.700 --> 03:00:18.700]  He truly feels
[03:00:18.700 --> 03:00:21.700]  And not the words
[03:00:21.700 --> 03:00:25.700]  Of one who kneels
[03:00:25.700 --> 03:00:28.700]  The record shows
[03:00:28.700 --> 03:00:31.700]  I took the blows
[03:00:31.700 --> 03:00:38.700]  And did it my way
[03:00:56.700 --> 03:00:59.700]  I took the blows
[03:00:59.700 --> 03:01:02.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:05.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:08.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:11.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:14.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:14.700 --> 03:01:17.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:17.700 --> 03:01:20.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:20.700 --> 03:01:23.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:23.700 --> 03:01:26.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:26.700 --> 03:01:29.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:32.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:32.700 --> 03:01:35.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:38.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:41.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:44.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:44.700 --> 03:01:47.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:50.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:50.700 --> 03:01:53.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:56.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:56.700 --> 03:01:59.700]  And did it my way
[03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:02.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:02.700 --> 03:02:05.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:05.700 --> 03:02:08.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:08.700 --> 03:02:11.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:14.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:17.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:17.700 --> 03:02:20.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:23.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:23.700 --> 03:02:26.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:26.700 --> 03:02:29.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:32.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:35.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:38.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:41.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:41.700 --> 03:02:44.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:44.700 --> 03:02:47.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:47.700 --> 03:02:50.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:50.700 --> 03:02:53.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:56.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:56.700 --> 03:02:59.700]  And did it my way
[03:02:59.700 --> 03:03:02.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:05.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:05.700 --> 03:03:08.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:08.700 --> 03:03:11.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:11.700 --> 03:03:14.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:17.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:20.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:23.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:23.700 --> 03:03:26.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:29.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:32.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:32.700 --> 03:03:35.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:35.700 --> 03:03:38.700]  And did it my way
[03:03:38.700 --> 03:03:43.980]  And I'm going to be getting your Alexa Pure, too, just to run it through another cycle.
[03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:48.460]  So I'll be purchasing that, too, through you.
[03:03:48.460 --> 03:03:52.460]  And I just want to stress again, you need to run for president.
[03:03:52.460 --> 03:03:55.260]  People like you, there's not a lot of Trumps and Alex Jones.
[03:03:55.260 --> 03:03:58.860]  I mean, he runs for president, and then what?
[03:03:58.860 --> 03:03:59.860]  Then who?
[03:03:59.860 --> 03:04:00.860]  Then who's fighting for us?
[03:04:00.860 --> 03:04:05.620]  I mean, there isn't a long line of people that are really going to put their necks out
[03:04:05.620 --> 03:04:09.460]  there for a possible assassination.
[03:04:09.460 --> 03:04:13.860]  And as far as Robert Kennedy goes, yeah, he's real.
[03:04:13.860 --> 03:04:16.380]  I think the Trojan horse is DeSantis.
[03:04:16.380 --> 03:04:17.380]  I think they're using him.
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:18.380]  I think that's why he's-
[03:04:18.380 --> 03:04:22.060]  Well, I mean, I think undoubtedly his handlers are Republican establishment people.
[03:04:22.060 --> 03:04:25.820]  So I don't want to say he's a bad guy just because he went with them, because he does
[03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:26.820]  a lot of good stuff.
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:30.340]  But yeah, I mean, if anybody's a Trojan horse, it's DeSantis.
[03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:31.340]  Most definitely.
[03:04:31.340 --> 03:04:37.900]  As far as the Adrenochrome goes, I was deleted and banned off of Twitter 15 years ago by
[03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:43.340]  Jack for posting, I created and posted the Black Eyed Club meme.
[03:04:43.340 --> 03:04:49.460]  So a bunch of those guys have the black eyes, and it was linked to the Adrenochrome, and
[03:04:49.460 --> 03:04:53.580]  I was putting out all that on Twitter, and Jack deleted me and banned me from my profile.
[03:04:53.580 --> 03:04:54.580]  Very strange.
[03:04:54.580 --> 03:04:57.580]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:04:57.580 --> 03:05:01.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[03:05:01.740 --> 03:05:05.900]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:05:05.900 --> 03:05:06.900]  That is a hellish future.
[03:05:06.900 --> 03:05:10.900]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:05:10.900 --> 03:05:14.900]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[03:05:14.900 --> 03:05:16.780]  Amazon, or infowareshore.com.
[03:05:16.780 --> 03:05:20.940]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[03:05:20.940 --> 03:05:24.900]  we got run out, and there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:05:24.900 --> 03:05:30.300]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at infowareshore.com.
[03:05:30.300 --> 03:05:34.220]  And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:34.220 --> 03:05:38.060]  So you won't just have this historic memento, and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:39.740]  you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:05:39.740 --> 03:05:43.620]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book, or unsigned copies.
[03:05:43.620 --> 03:05:48.940]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet, to go to infowareshore.com and get a signed
[03:05:48.940 --> 03:05:53.060]  copy, and buy a couple of unsigned copies, and donate them to the library, or give them
[03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:54.420]  to the local school.
[03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:57.420]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[03:06:25.420 --> 03:06:28.420]  Battle Cry, Cindy in Arizona, thanks for holding.
[03:06:28.420 --> 03:06:32.420]  You're on the air, with Kit Heckenliebly, go ahead.
[03:06:33.420 --> 03:06:37.420]  Hey, Alex, oh my gosh, I'm so glad to talk to you again.
[03:06:37.420 --> 03:06:42.420]  I am the woman that did your first Battle Cry ever, in history.
[03:06:42.420 --> 03:06:45.420]  You mean like called in and imitated it, or did you?
[03:06:45.420 --> 03:06:46.420]  Yeah.
[03:06:46.420 --> 03:06:47.420]  Do you remember me?
[03:06:47.420 --> 03:06:49.420]  I do remember, years ago.
[03:06:49.420 --> 03:06:51.420]  I red-pilled all my neighbors.
[03:06:51.420 --> 03:06:55.420]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
[03:06:56.420 --> 03:06:58.420]  Anyway, do you know what Alex?
[03:06:58.420 --> 03:07:00.420]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
[03:07:00.420 --> 03:07:01.420]  Yeah.
[03:07:01.420 --> 03:07:03.420]  That's not very scary.
[03:07:03.420 --> 03:07:04.420]  You better get better at that.
[03:07:04.420 --> 03:07:05.420]  I'm not being mean.
[03:07:05.420 --> 03:07:06.420]  What's the matter?
[03:07:06.420 --> 03:07:07.420]  Let me see your war face.
[03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:08.420]  AHHHHHHHHHH!
[03:07:08.420 --> 03:07:09.420]  He goes, I'm not very scary.
[03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:10.420]  You try to get better at that.
[03:07:10.420 --> 03:07:11.420]  What's he say, what's your war face?
[03:07:11.420 --> 03:07:12.420]  Can you pull that up?
[03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:15.420]  Anyways, yes ma'am, what's on your mind?
[03:07:15.420 --> 03:07:19.420]  My dog, my dog is looking at me like, oh my god.
[03:07:19.420 --> 03:07:22.420]  Oh my gosh, lost it for sure.
[03:07:22.420 --> 03:07:24.920]  What kind of dog do you have?
[03:07:24.920 --> 03:07:28.100]  I have a Staffordshire Pit Bull.
[03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:30.620]  Her name is Delta.
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:34.100]  She's nine years old almost, and she's limping around,
[03:07:34.100 --> 03:07:35.260]  but she thinks I'm cute.
[03:07:35.260 --> 03:07:36.060]  That's it anyway.
[03:07:36.060 --> 03:07:39.260]  But you like, so you like Governor DeSantis,
[03:07:39.260 --> 03:07:42.260]  and he just legalized Pit Bulls.
[03:07:42.260 --> 03:07:44.780]  I don't like Governor DeSantis.
[03:07:44.780 --> 03:07:46.060]  I'm sorry, period.
[03:07:46.060 --> 03:07:47.300]  I don't care what he does.
[03:07:47.300 --> 03:07:48.180]  I don't trust him.
[03:07:48.180 --> 03:07:50.740]  And we should feed DeSantis to the Pit Bulls.
[03:07:50.740 --> 03:07:51.740]  That's a joke, media.
[03:07:51.740 --> 03:07:52.940]  No one's hitting Armageddon.
[03:07:52.940 --> 03:07:53.980]  It's DeSantis.
[03:07:53.980 --> 03:07:54.740]  Oh my goodness.
[03:07:54.740 --> 03:07:57.980]  Well, the reason I called is I actually had a couple things.
[03:07:57.980 --> 03:08:00.340]  But I don't know if you have time, but real quick,
[03:08:00.340 --> 03:08:02.220]  I wanted to, a couple weeks ago, you
[03:08:02.220 --> 03:08:06.340]  had a couple of callers in a row that, trying to tell you
[03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:07.540]  what you should be doing.
[03:08:07.540 --> 03:08:10.500]  And I could just see the hurt and pain.
[03:08:10.500 --> 03:08:13.500]  And in fact, you ended up saying, I'm done.
[03:08:13.500 --> 03:08:14.420]  I'm done for today.
[03:08:14.420 --> 03:08:15.260]  I'm leaving.
[03:08:15.260 --> 03:08:17.540]  Yeah, I think I'm taking the rest of the week off too,
[03:08:18.220 --> 03:08:19.940]  I love you.
[03:08:19.940 --> 03:08:21.860]  I'm kind of burned out on all this.
[03:08:21.860 --> 03:08:24.060]  What I'm tired of doing is directing people.
[03:08:24.060 --> 03:08:26.460]  If I never told somebody what to do again the rest of my life,
[03:08:26.460 --> 03:08:27.020]  I'd be happy.
[03:08:27.020 --> 03:08:30.340]  I'm just tired and tired of telling people what to do.
[03:08:30.340 --> 03:08:31.780]  I can only imagine.
[03:08:31.780 --> 03:08:35.140]  I literally had tears in my eyes that day for you,
[03:08:35.140 --> 03:08:39.020]  because of everything you've done, so much for people.
[03:08:39.020 --> 03:08:41.460]  And I think you need to be appreciated.
[03:08:41.460 --> 03:08:44.020]  So I did a little play with your name,
[03:08:44.020 --> 03:08:46.500]  and I called to give you a pep talk.
[03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:50.780]  And I just want you to know that the A, in my mind,
[03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:52.620]  is for Admiral.
[03:08:52.620 --> 03:08:54.380]  Oh my God, stop it.
[03:08:54.380 --> 03:08:57.980]  The definition is the commander of a fleet,
[03:08:57.980 --> 03:09:00.620]  or a naval officer of high rank.
[03:09:00.620 --> 03:09:01.940]  And you know what?
[03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:05.740]  You lead us through the reprisees, the tidal waves,
[03:09:05.740 --> 03:09:10.060]  the fraud, the transhumanism, the financial collapse,
[03:09:10.060 --> 03:09:14.020]  the perversion of our children, and the pure evil
[03:09:14.060 --> 03:09:17.180]  that the globalist agenda has laid out for us.
[03:09:17.180 --> 03:09:18.460]  Well, you're very sweet to say that,
[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:21.020]  Babel Christ, Cindy, but I'm not in a bad mood
[03:09:21.020 --> 03:09:23.820]  because of the crew, or you, or people not calling me names
[03:09:23.820 --> 03:09:24.700]  like Admiral.
[03:09:24.700 --> 03:09:26.580]  I'm just sick of the new world order.
[03:09:26.580 --> 03:09:28.660]  I'm sick of looking at Biden stumble around
[03:09:28.660 --> 03:09:30.100]  with that rubber face.
[03:09:30.100 --> 03:09:31.380]  I'm sick of World War III.
[03:09:31.380 --> 03:09:33.500]  I'm just tired of it all.
[03:09:33.500 --> 03:09:38.740]  And I'm also very neurotic about information now, very OCD.
[03:09:38.740 --> 03:09:39.740]  Didn't used to be OCD.
[03:09:39.740 --> 03:09:42.340]  I'm very OCD about things.
[03:09:42.340 --> 03:09:47.300]  And so I want to see footage of purple containers of iodine
[03:09:47.300 --> 03:09:50.900]  bubbling, not a beaker, not a Petri dish.
[03:09:50.900 --> 03:09:54.500]  It's big vats of bubbling iodine that I know we
[03:09:54.500 --> 03:09:56.380]  have hundreds of footage of.
[03:09:56.380 --> 03:10:02.940]  And so now, OK, oh, oh, I'm feeling better now.
[03:10:02.940 --> 03:10:05.940]  OK, Cindy, I want to know what the X is.
[03:10:05.940 --> 03:10:06.740]  What's the X?
[03:10:06.740 --> 03:10:07.980]  Wow.
[03:10:07.980 --> 03:10:08.820]  Give me the X.
[03:10:08.820 --> 03:10:09.300]  Hold on.
[03:10:09.300 --> 03:10:11.300]  This is really good.
[03:10:11.300 --> 03:10:12.700]  Show me that big purple bottle again.
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:15.020]  Give me the X.
[03:10:15.020 --> 03:10:17.460]  Mind is that God is in control the whole time.
[03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:18.860]  And that's very important.
[03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:21.060]  So the L is for legendary.
[03:10:21.060 --> 03:10:25.380]  The definition of legendary is extremely famous or notorious,
[03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:27.060]  which I think fits the word better.
[03:10:27.060 --> 03:10:29.060]  You gave me the L. He was the leader.
[03:10:29.060 --> 03:10:30.820]  You gave me E, evil.
[03:10:30.820 --> 03:10:31.900]  What's the X?
[03:10:31.900 --> 03:10:35.300]  Especially in the field of broadcasting,
[03:10:35.300 --> 03:10:38.340]  can you believe that's the actual definition?
[03:10:38.340 --> 03:10:39.700]  And so you know what?
[03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:41.580]  You're going to leave your spirit behind long
[03:10:41.580 --> 03:10:43.860]  after you're gone, Alex.
[03:10:43.860 --> 03:10:46.660]  People, your name is going to be coming off
[03:10:46.660 --> 03:10:49.500]  of the lips of people for many, many, many years.
[03:10:49.500 --> 03:10:51.380]  Poor people.
[03:10:51.380 --> 03:10:53.980]  The E is for exonerate.
[03:10:53.980 --> 03:10:55.860]  It's to show or exonerate.
[03:10:55.860 --> 03:10:57.500]  OK.
[03:10:57.500 --> 03:11:00.980]  That someone or something is not true.
[03:11:00.980 --> 03:11:02.140]  And is X for xylophone?
[03:11:02.140 --> 03:11:04.900]  That they are fraudulent or guilty.
[03:11:04.900 --> 03:11:06.900]  You exonerated all the doctors who
[03:11:06.900 --> 03:11:11.820]  were blackmailed or blackballed during COVID.
[03:11:11.820 --> 03:11:14.060]  You exonerated a lot of the Proud Boys
[03:11:14.060 --> 03:11:17.740]  and the people that are sitting in jail after January 6th.
[03:11:17.740 --> 03:11:20.060]  So I know you want me to give you the X.
[03:11:20.060 --> 03:11:22.260]  Well, I'm not that brilliant.
[03:11:22.260 --> 03:11:24.860]  So I did X it.
[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:26.380]  I thought it was exonerate.
[03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:27.660]  Exonerate.
[03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:31.100]  Exonerate was the E. Now it's the X.
[03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:31.980]  OK.
[03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:35.540]  I just put X it because X is not a word.
[03:11:35.540 --> 03:11:36.660]  Exonerate.
[03:11:36.860 --> 03:11:38.180]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:11:38.180 --> 03:11:39.460]  Enough about me.
[03:11:39.460 --> 03:11:42.580]  If I seem bummed out sometimes, it's because some, I mean,
[03:11:42.580 --> 03:11:44.380]  I'm telling you positive stuff's happening,
[03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:46.820]  but it's also, in a way, unhealthy.
[03:11:46.820 --> 03:11:49.620]  How do you focus on all this negative stuff and stay positive?
[03:11:49.620 --> 03:11:54.620]  You know, what I remember this Bible verse,
[03:11:54.620 --> 03:11:56.140]  and I'm probably going to butcher it,
[03:11:56.140 --> 03:12:00.260]  but is the Lord does not delight in evil,
[03:12:00.260 --> 03:12:02.260]  but delights in the truth.
[03:12:02.260 --> 03:12:06.500]  And when I learn the truth, I really feel excitement.
[03:12:06.780 --> 03:12:11.420]  And I feel blessed that not only do I understand the truth,
[03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:14.060]  but I can share it with the public
[03:12:14.060 --> 03:12:15.820]  through working with you,
[03:12:15.820 --> 03:12:17.380]  working with the other whistleblowers,
[03:12:17.380 --> 03:12:18.580]  working with James O'Keefe
[03:12:18.580 --> 03:12:20.700]  and the Project Veritas whistleblowers.
[03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:22.980]  I just feel this enormous sense,
[03:12:22.980 --> 03:12:26.420]  because, you know, 10, 15 years ago,
[03:12:26.420 --> 03:12:28.340]  I felt extremely powerless.
[03:12:29.420 --> 03:12:32.900]  My daughter, very severe autism, very challenging.
[03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:35.900]  I remember asking God,
[03:12:35.900 --> 03:12:39.060]  please explain why this is happening.
[03:12:39.060 --> 03:12:42.260]  I need to understand what I'm going through.
[03:12:42.260 --> 03:12:45.260]  Now, I am a New York Times bestselling author.
[03:12:45.260 --> 03:12:47.500]  I am working with the most amazing people,
[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:49.300]  Dr. Judy Majkovic.
[03:12:49.300 --> 03:12:51.300]  I'm working with Dr. Paul Alexander,
[03:12:51.300 --> 03:12:54.100]  who was the senior pandemic advisor.
[03:12:54.100 --> 03:12:55.300]  I'm working with James O'Keefe
[03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:57.100]  and the Project Veritas whistleblowers.
[03:12:57.100 --> 03:12:58.500]  I'm working with you.
[03:12:58.500 --> 03:13:02.740]  And I just thank God that I went from that place,
[03:13:03.580 --> 03:13:04.420]  and my daughter is doing extremely well.
[03:13:04.420 --> 03:13:06.220]  She's communicating, you know,
[03:13:06.220 --> 03:13:08.860]  25 years old to find your voice again.
[03:13:08.860 --> 03:13:11.620]  I just feel inspired by what-
[03:13:11.620 --> 03:13:13.780]  Imagine, unable to talk to her until recently,
[03:13:13.780 --> 03:13:14.660]  and I love the stories.
[03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:15.740]  I want a red convertible.
[03:13:15.740 --> 03:13:16.580]  I want a man.
[03:13:16.580 --> 03:13:18.420]  Yeah, exactly, you know?
[03:13:18.420 --> 03:13:22.540]  And so I understand that these are dark days,
[03:13:22.540 --> 03:13:25.620]  but they're also days filled with light.
[03:13:25.620 --> 03:13:28.980]  It's not just that this evil is happening.
[03:13:28.980 --> 03:13:31.100]  It's that it's being revealed.
[03:13:31.100 --> 03:13:36.100]  So I feel so empowered that we are seeing the evil
[03:13:38.500 --> 03:13:42.460]  and we are being the human beings who God meant us to be,
[03:13:42.460 --> 03:13:44.100]  and we are taking action.
[03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:45.700]  How are we taking action?
[03:13:45.700 --> 03:13:49.060]  We are doing things like going to see Sound of Freedom.
[03:13:49.060 --> 03:13:52.100]  We are doing things like not buying Bud Light.
[03:13:52.100 --> 03:13:54.180]  We are not-
[03:13:54.180 --> 03:13:55.700]  And those sound like little trinket things,
[03:13:55.700 --> 03:13:57.140]  but those are big things in the aggregate.
[03:13:57.140 --> 03:13:57.980]  We're almost out of time.
[03:13:57.980 --> 03:13:59.060]  I got to get to one more caller.
[03:13:59.060 --> 03:14:00.020]  You got to come back sometime
[03:14:00.020 --> 03:14:01.220]  and just talk about your daughter for a while.
[03:14:01.220 --> 03:14:02.940]  We talk about her a lot at lunch and stuff,
[03:14:02.940 --> 03:14:06.460]  and it's amazing that she hasn't really been able to talk,
[03:14:06.460 --> 03:14:07.700]  but now she's doing everything
[03:14:07.700 --> 03:14:08.900]  and talks to you by text message.
[03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:09.740]  Yeah, sure.
[03:14:09.740 --> 03:14:10.580]  And her whole mind's there.
[03:14:10.580 --> 03:14:11.460]  A smart person just can't talk.
[03:14:11.460 --> 03:14:13.420]  Yeah, so she used a letter board,
[03:14:13.420 --> 03:14:18.420]  and she just told my wife this week
[03:14:19.420 --> 03:14:22.100]  that she wants to go see the new Barbie movie.
[03:14:22.100 --> 03:14:23.540]  What the heck is that?
[03:14:23.540 --> 03:14:26.100]  So it's wonderful.
[03:14:26.100 --> 03:14:28.020]  I think so many great things are happening.
[03:14:28.020 --> 03:14:29.740]  I'm happy to be a part of it.
[03:14:30.500 --> 03:14:32.140]  I'm happy that God has put me on the field.
[03:14:32.140 --> 03:14:33.140]  Put me in, coach.
[03:14:33.140 --> 03:14:34.700]  I want to fight.
[03:14:34.700 --> 03:14:36.260]  All right, we only got a minute and a half of this caller,
[03:14:36.260 --> 03:14:37.620]  or if not, they can make the choice.
[03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:38.900]  I can call him back tomorrow.
[03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:40.100]  We got to go to break, and Gerald Slunday's
[03:14:40.100 --> 03:14:40.940]  about to take over.
[03:14:40.940 --> 03:14:42.180]  He's a great guy, as you all know.
[03:14:42.180 --> 03:14:43.180]  Robert, New York.
[03:14:43.180 --> 03:14:44.020]  You'll be our telegunner.
[03:14:44.020 --> 03:14:44.980]  Sorry we're short on time.
[03:14:44.980 --> 03:14:46.100]  Go ahead.
[03:14:46.100 --> 03:14:46.940]  Hi, Alex.
[03:14:46.940 --> 03:14:48.900]  I'll try to get all four points in.
[03:14:48.900 --> 03:14:50.740]  Number one, I support Trump,
[03:14:50.740 --> 03:14:52.740]  and I even support RFK more.
[03:14:52.740 --> 03:14:55.380]  I believe they're the best, most reliable options.
[03:14:55.380 --> 03:14:56.700]  That doesn't mean we shouldn't try
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:14:58.300]  to push them to be better.
[03:14:58.300 --> 03:15:01.140]  So, for example, they need to have support of law
[03:15:01.140 --> 03:15:02.900]  against the vaccine mandates.
[03:15:02.900 --> 03:15:04.420]  No one should be able to force anyone
[03:15:04.420 --> 03:15:06.860]  at the local or federal or private level to take-
[03:15:06.860 --> 03:15:09.220]  I agree, we should push Kennedy and Trump
[03:15:09.220 --> 03:15:11.860]  to support a law banning them.
[03:15:11.860 --> 03:15:14.220]  Also, number two, in terms of prayer,
[03:15:14.220 --> 03:15:15.060]  prayer's very important.
[03:15:15.060 --> 03:15:17.220]  I pray to God, and I just want to point out,
[03:15:17.220 --> 03:15:19.860]  I pray to God, not a human being, not Moses,
[03:15:19.860 --> 03:15:20.700]  anyone else.
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:21.540]  I pray to God.
[03:15:21.540 --> 03:15:24.500]  Number three is I wanted to point out your CBD,
[03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:26.100]  full spectrum, 1,000 milligrams.
[03:15:26.100 --> 03:15:26.980]  Thank you very much.
[03:15:26.980 --> 03:15:28.740]  Also, I sometimes send to you
[03:15:28.740 --> 03:15:31.460]  U.S. postal money orders anonymously.
[03:15:31.460 --> 03:15:32.860]  So, for all those people who are scared
[03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:34.100]  about the government tracking them,
[03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:35.140]  you can use cash.
[03:15:35.140 --> 03:15:37.100]  They still didn't get the digital currency in,
[03:15:37.100 --> 03:15:39.700]  and now your postal money order's supporting you.
[03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:41.300]  I make anonymous donations.
[03:15:41.300 --> 03:15:45.020]  And finally, to people who can't get to twitter.com,
[03:15:45.020 --> 03:15:45.980]  what they might want to do is,
[03:15:45.980 --> 03:15:48.180]  for example, they want to go to Law & Women's Twitter site.
[03:15:48.180 --> 03:15:50.660]  They can go to niddr.net instead of twitter.com.
[03:15:50.660 --> 03:15:51.500]  We're out of time.
[03:15:51.500 --> 03:15:52.340]  I love you, brother.
[03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:53.180]  We'll call you back tomorrow.
[03:15:53.180 --> 03:15:54.020]  Here comes Gerald Celente.
[03:15:56.980 --> 03:15:59.540]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third
[03:15:59.540 --> 03:16:02.540]  most deadly acid on earth,
[03:16:02.540 --> 03:16:05.220]  and they've got our children drinking that.
[03:16:05.220 --> 03:16:08.580]  This is a psychotic death cult, period,
[03:16:08.580 --> 03:16:11.060]  case closed, out to get you and your family.
[03:16:11.060 --> 03:16:13.420]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[03:16:13.420 --> 03:16:16.020]  made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour Group.
[03:16:16.020 --> 03:16:17.500]  It's been around about 15 years,
[03:16:17.500 --> 03:16:19.340]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[03:16:19.340 --> 03:16:20.580]  They went out, hired engineers,
[03:16:20.580 --> 03:16:23.540]  reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system
[03:16:23.540 --> 03:16:25.340]  out there that sells for twice the price,
[03:16:25.380 --> 03:16:28.860]  and they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:16:28.860 --> 03:16:30.980]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[03:16:30.980 --> 03:16:32.100]  thousands of chemicals.
[03:16:32.100 --> 03:16:33.620]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:35.220]  There's four or five other filters out there
[03:16:35.220 --> 03:16:36.380]  that are just as good.
[03:16:36.380 --> 03:16:38.580]  We sell the very best, highest grade
[03:16:38.580 --> 03:16:40.660]  water filtration system for half the price
[03:16:40.660 --> 03:16:41.620]  of a leading competitor,
[03:16:41.620 --> 03:16:45.260]  and the media says we're bad and a cult
[03:16:45.260 --> 03:16:47.140]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:16:47.140 --> 03:16:48.780]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:16:48.780 --> 03:16:50.380]  That's another way you absorb this crap,
[03:16:50.380 --> 03:16:51.860]  but I'm done talking about that.
[03:16:51.860 --> 03:16:53.540]  The point is, you can get the filters
[03:16:53.580 --> 03:16:54.580]  at MFullWorksStore.com.
[03:16:54.580 --> 03:16:56.820]  They're discounted right now, finally back in stock.
[03:16:56.820 --> 03:16:57.980]  In the short time we have,
[03:16:57.980 --> 03:16:59.860]  I can't get into all the incredible ingredients
[03:16:59.860 --> 03:17:01.300]  in Super Female Vitality.
[03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:04.020]  Go to MFullWorksStore.com, read about the ingredients,
[03:17:04.020 --> 03:17:05.980]  look them up for yourself, and then understand,
[03:17:05.980 --> 03:17:07.820]  this is cold-pressed herbs,
[03:17:07.820 --> 03:17:10.100]  so it has a more powerful effect on the body.
[03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:13.620]  Get yours today at MFullWorksStore.com for 50% off.
[03:17:15.020 --> 03:17:17.100]  Super Male Vitality is selling out.
[03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:19.940]  It's an incredible formula for stamina, energy, libido.
[03:17:19.940 --> 03:17:21.300]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[03:17:21.300 --> 03:17:23.940]  But the good news is, we have several thousand bottles left
[03:17:23.940 --> 03:17:26.580]  of Super Female Vitality that's the same formula.
[03:17:26.580 --> 03:17:29.220]  It boosts men, it boosts women, it works great.
[03:17:29.220 --> 03:17:31.060]  But women like pink labels,
[03:17:31.060 --> 03:17:32.980]  men like different color labels,
[03:17:32.980 --> 03:17:35.020]  so it works for men as well.
[03:17:35.020 --> 03:17:36.100]  It's the same formula.
[03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:38.500]  It's an incredible formula, and it funds our operation.
[03:17:38.500 --> 03:17:39.860]  And there's another important part
[03:17:39.860 --> 03:17:41.660]  of the overall information.
[03:17:41.660 --> 03:17:44.300]  It's 50% off for a limited time.

[03:17:54.860 --> 03:17:56.460]  at MFullWorksStore.com.
[03:17:57.460 --> 03:18:00.740]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[03:18:00.740 --> 03:18:04.420]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[03:18:04.420 --> 03:18:07.460]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil
[03:18:07.460 --> 03:18:09.220]  of this essential trace element,
[03:18:09.220 --> 03:18:11.620]  which has caused an iodine deficiency
[03:18:11.620 --> 03:18:13.460]  in about half the population.
[03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:16.300]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[03:18:16.300 --> 03:18:19.620]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:18:19.660 --> 03:18:21.940]  There are plenty of proven technologies
[03:18:21.940 --> 03:18:24.300]  in permaculture and biodynamics
[03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:28.180]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:29.460]  And we need to ensure
[03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:32.980]  that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[03:18:32.980 --> 03:18:35.340]  Derived from ancient sea salts
[03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:38.460]  found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,
[03:18:38.460 --> 03:18:43.460]  our InfoWars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:18:44.500 --> 03:18:47.540]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized
[03:18:47.540 --> 03:18:50.540]  in an activated triiodine form.
[03:18:50.540 --> 03:18:53.660]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,
[03:18:53.660 --> 03:18:57.060]  get yours now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:57.060 --> 03:19:00.900]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power,

[03:19:03.420 --> 03:19:05.940]  and they're both 50% off.
[03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:10.180]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:12.020]  These are amazing products,
[03:19:12.020 --> 03:19:14.220]  and for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[03:19:14.220 --> 03:19:16.460]  Brain Force Ultra hits in 15 minutes,
[03:19:16.460 --> 03:19:18.900]  only lasts three hours with no hangover.
[03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:20.300]  It is a game changer.
[03:19:20.300 --> 03:19:21.900]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[03:19:21.900 --> 03:19:25.860]  Then our Brain Force Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[03:19:25.860 --> 03:19:28.140]  It gives you four to six hours of amazing energy,
[03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:30.700]  again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[03:19:30.700 --> 03:19:33.420]  Both products back in stock, InfoWarsStore.com,

[03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:48.620]  the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[03:19:48.620 --> 03:19:51.940]  The answer to 1984 is 1776,
[03:19:51.940 --> 03:19:54.660]  and the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[03:19:58.100 --> 03:20:00.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[03:20:00.900 --> 03:20:04.500]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.700 --> 03:20:30.700]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Celente.
[03:20:30.700 --> 03:20:37.700]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:37.700 --> 03:20:40.700]  As Alex said, do all you can to support Infowars.
[03:20:40.700 --> 03:20:43.700]  Because Infowars is doing all they can to support you.
[03:20:43.700 --> 03:20:47.700]  And when you look at the mainstream media, I mean, they're just prostitutes.
[03:20:47.700 --> 03:20:53.700]  They're media whores that get paid to put out by the corporate pimps and the government whoremasters.
[03:20:53.700 --> 03:20:58.700]  You take the mainstream media.
[03:20:58.700 --> 03:21:02.700]  I hardly watch this stuff.
[03:21:02.700 --> 03:21:06.700]  Actually, I haven't watched television now going on four years.
[03:21:06.700 --> 03:21:10.700]  I brought my sister up from a nursing home because every time I go see her, she was dead.
[03:21:10.700 --> 03:21:14.700]  But now she's alive since I brought her up here.
[03:21:14.700 --> 03:21:16.700]  And she's here full time.
[03:21:16.700 --> 03:21:18.700]  And she watches television.
[03:21:18.700 --> 03:21:21.700]  And I see these drug ads.
[03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:24.700]  And if you take this drug, you'll get rid of this.
[03:21:24.700 --> 03:21:25.700]  And you'll get rid of that.
[03:21:25.700 --> 03:21:26.700]  You'll get rid of this.
[03:21:26.700 --> 03:21:27.700]  And you'll get rid of that.
[03:21:27.700 --> 03:21:29.700]  And here are the side effects.
[03:21:29.700 --> 03:21:32.700]  Oh, you see the side effects now from some of the weight loss drugs?
[03:21:32.700 --> 03:21:34.700]  Oh, people are becoming suicidal.
[03:21:34.700 --> 03:21:38.700]  Yeah, don't talk about eating healthy.
[03:21:38.700 --> 03:21:40.700]  Don't talk about exercise.
[03:21:40.700 --> 03:21:44.700]  Don't talk about stop eating junk food.
[03:21:44.700 --> 03:21:50.700]  Don't talk about, oh, Pepsi Cola sales and Coca-Cola sales are going up great.
[03:21:50.700 --> 03:21:52.700]  Oh, well, their volume is down, but they raised the prices.
[03:21:52.700 --> 03:21:55.700]  Yeah, terrific.
[03:21:55.700 --> 03:21:57.700]  Don't get healthy.
[03:21:57.700 --> 03:21:58.700]  Take the drug.
[03:21:58.700 --> 03:22:09.700]  So going back to this, it was that arrogant slime ball, that little arrogant nothing of a clown,
[03:22:09.700 --> 03:22:20.700]  a little boy of nobody, which shows you that anybody could become president, Bill Slick Willie Clinton.
[03:22:20.700 --> 03:22:23.700]  And you know why they call him Slick Willie?
[03:22:23.700 --> 03:22:26.700]  Because he had a slick Willie.
[03:22:26.700 --> 03:22:27.700]  That's right.
[03:22:27.700 --> 03:22:32.700]  Every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away over Baghdad.
[03:22:32.700 --> 03:22:34.700]  Oh, yeah.
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:38.700]  Killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five.
[03:22:38.700 --> 03:22:40.700]  Because of the sanctions.
[03:22:40.700 --> 03:22:42.700]  Madeline, not all that bright.
[03:22:42.700 --> 03:22:49.700]  Another warmongering freak caught on 60 Minutes, asked by Leslie Stahl,
[03:22:49.700 --> 03:22:59.700]  is the price of the sanctions of the war that Bill Clinton has put on Iraq that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five worth it?
[03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:02.700]  And she said, yes, it is.
[03:23:02.700 --> 03:23:05.700]  Going back to Slick Willie.
[03:23:07.100 --> 03:23:19.100]  That's the guy that allowed the drug dealers, oh, excuse me, big pharma, to put their ads on TV.
[03:23:19.100 --> 03:23:31.100]  1997. Oh, he's the same arrogant, arrogant, arrogant, arrogant little boy, along with that gore, oh yeah.
[03:23:31.200 --> 03:23:43.840]  I brought China into the World Trade Organization, sucked our jobs out with NAFTA down to Mexico,
[03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:46.040]  that Bill Clinton, yep.
[03:23:46.100 --> 03:23:54.620]  And yeah, listen, I can understand why you got hot with Monica Lewinsky, because when
[03:23:54.620 --> 03:23:59.340]  you look at Hillary Clinton, my own, who'd want to be with her?
[03:23:59.340 --> 03:24:03.380]  Anyway, that Bill Clinton, also gay, destroyed.
[03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:16.200]  The media business with the Federal Communications Act of 1996.
[03:24:16.200 --> 03:24:23.360]  So going back to the drug dealers, that's a good picture of a, what are you, kidding?
[03:24:23.360 --> 03:24:25.280]  Maroon.
[03:24:25.280 --> 03:24:32.560]  Going back to the drug dealers on the Cartoon News Network on Sunday, this was the front
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:34.880]  page article.
[03:24:34.880 --> 03:24:40.800]  A doctor known for assessing COVID risk fell ill with the virus.
[03:24:41.900 --> 03:24:46.900]  Here's what he wants you to know.
[03:24:46.900 --> 03:24:49.900]  You look at this guy.
[03:24:49.900 --> 03:24:53.900]  He got a black eye, got stitches all over.
[03:24:54.200 --> 03:24:58.200]  You got that clip there to put up?
[03:24:59.900 --> 03:25:06.460]  A doctor known for advising people on the risks of COVID-19, there he is, look at this
[03:25:06.460 --> 03:25:07.460]  guy.
[03:25:07.460 --> 03:25:08.539]  Look at this guy.
[03:25:08.539 --> 03:25:10.660]  Look at this guy.
[03:25:10.660 --> 03:25:17.619]  Look at this clown boy, an arrogant, hey, I'm a doctor, you call me doctor, you don't
[03:25:17.619 --> 03:25:18.619]  call me.
[03:25:18.619 --> 03:25:20.779]  Hey, how about go screw yourself?
[03:25:20.779 --> 03:25:22.779]  This is the clown boy.
[03:25:22.779 --> 03:25:28.060]  This is the arrogant clown boy on the Cartoon News Network, CNN, that kept promoting the
[03:25:28.060 --> 03:25:29.060]  COVID jab.
[03:25:29.220 --> 03:25:31.220]  That's right.
[03:25:31.220 --> 03:25:36.020]  A doctor known for advising people on the risks of COVID-19, advising people, shoving
[03:25:36.020 --> 03:25:42.180]  his crap out that they were selling, because they're the big drug dealers over there.
[03:25:42.180 --> 03:25:45.539]  They get the drug dealers all on CNN.
[03:25:45.539 --> 03:25:50.500]  Every other commercial's drug deal, not every other one, but a load of them, like on all
[03:25:50.500 --> 03:25:53.500]  of these so-called news networks.
[03:25:53.500 --> 03:25:57.020]  One drug ad after another, can't understand why they're promoting this stuff.
[03:25:57.020 --> 03:26:03.100]  Oh, by the way, in your Trends Journal, no advertisers, zero, zip, nada, anyway.
[03:26:04.300 --> 03:26:07.300]  The risk of COVID-19 got a double surprise.
[03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:09.300]  He got COVID.
[03:26:10.300 --> 03:26:13.300]  And he wound up needing stitches because of it.
[03:26:14.300 --> 03:26:16.300]  Dr. Robert Watcha!
[03:26:17.300 --> 03:26:19.300]  Dr. Robert Slimeball!
[03:26:20.300 --> 03:26:23.300]  Dr. Robert Propaganda Seller!
[03:26:24.300 --> 03:26:28.300]  Dr. Robert Piece of Garbage Scum!
[03:26:29.300 --> 03:26:30.300]  As I would call him.
[03:26:30.300 --> 03:26:33.300]  And, hey, Black Eyed Susan.
[03:26:34.300 --> 03:26:37.300]  That's my book that I worked on the first one.
[03:26:38.300 --> 03:26:39.300]  Natural Healing.
[03:26:40.300 --> 03:26:42.300]  Hey, got no COVID jab.
[03:26:43.300 --> 03:26:44.300]  Got no COVID.
[03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:52.300]  But Dr. Robert Watcha, who chairs the Department of Medicine at the University of California in San Francisco.
[03:26:52.300 --> 03:26:59.300]  Oh, San Francisco, the cities that's destroyed because the geeks are the first to lock it down.
[03:27:00.300 --> 03:27:03.300]  And has a 30% office vacancy rate.
[03:27:04.300 --> 03:27:06.300]  And all the businesses are going down the toilet.
[03:27:07.300 --> 03:27:08.300]  Well, you should get flushed down, too.
[03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:13.300]  Anyway, Dr. Watcha said he tested positive for COVID.
[03:27:14.300 --> 03:27:17.300]  That he had not tested positive for COVID until last week.
[03:27:18.300 --> 03:27:20.300]  According to posts on his Twitter account.
[03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:23.300]  He said he was fully vaccinated.
[03:27:24.300 --> 03:27:30.300]  And received his second bivalent booster in April.
[03:27:31.300 --> 03:27:33.300]  And you got COVID!
[03:27:34.300 --> 03:27:36.300]  And you got COVID!
[03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:45.600]  He said the symptoms started with a dry cough and a dead head on July 9th.
[03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:49.760]  And by that night, he had a fever, chills, and a sore throat.
[03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:54.960]  Oh, you couldn't spew out your crap with your sore throat?
[03:27:54.960 --> 03:27:59.200]  Watchtower said he made a mistake the following day when he took a shower.
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:03.160]  What, to rinse the crap off ya?
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:07.160]  While feeling these flu-like symptoms, I woke up sick.
[03:28:07.160 --> 03:28:11.080]  I woke up in a bloody pool in the bathroom floor, he wrote on Twitter.
[03:28:11.080 --> 03:28:16.160]  It was a dent in the lid of the trash can, likely where my head hit.
[03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:17.840]  I remembered nothing.
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:22.880]  As I managed to get up, it was clear that my face was going to need stitches, and more
[03:28:22.880 --> 03:28:23.680]  than a couple.
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:31.560]  He declined an interview to go in more details, watched it became highly followed doctor on
[03:28:31.560 --> 03:28:38.359]  Twitter to sharing his own risk gauging and COVID advice during the pandemic
[03:28:40.359 --> 03:28:43.240]  and has urged people to get vaccinated.
[03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:47.480]  Yep. Here you got it.
[03:28:47.480 --> 03:28:55.000]  Get the jab, get COVID and get those stitches.
[03:28:56.679 --> 03:29:00.439]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:07.000]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at infowarestore.com. They are both
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:12.519]  clones of national best selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash supplement maker
[03:29:12.519 --> 03:29:16.119]  that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it
[03:29:16.119 --> 03:29:21.960]  at a lower price you'll find in stores. It's joint relief max and nerve renew.
[03:29:22.679 --> 03:29:29.080]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and also make your
[03:29:29.080 --> 03:29:34.199]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[03:29:34.199 --> 03:29:40.119]  inductive to pain. There's major research behind this all you need to get joint relief max from
[03:29:40.119 --> 03:29:48.199]  InfoWars MD and nerve renew from InfoWars MD exclusively at infowarestore.com right now.
[03:29:48.199 --> 03:29:53.800]  Introducing them both 25% off. You'll find them exclusively at infowarestore.com and they fund
[03:29:53.800 --> 03:30:01.800]  their operation. I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody
[03:30:01.800 --> 03:30:07.880]  can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. But when we talk about the
[03:30:07.880 --> 03:30:13.800]  crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been
[03:30:13.800 --> 03:30:19.000]  the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they
[03:30:19.000 --> 03:30:25.640]  engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself, the
[03:30:25.640 --> 03:30:30.119]  whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support. I want to encourage you now to realize
[03:30:30.119 --> 03:30:35.400]  that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know
[03:30:35.400 --> 03:30:39.800]  you pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go to
[03:30:39.800 --> 03:30:44.279]  infowarestore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:30:44.279 --> 03:30:48.599]  All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy
[03:30:48.599 --> 03:30:53.960]  products at infowarestore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarestore.com,
[03:30:53.960 --> 03:30:56.439]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[03:30:56.439 --> 03:31:01.320]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[03:31:01.320 --> 03:31:03.960]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[03:31:04.039 --> 03:31:09.080]  Let me get this straight. The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document showing
[03:31:09.080 --> 03:31:13.080]  that during the Obama administration, Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son
[03:31:13.080 --> 03:31:17.480]  Hunter to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[03:31:17.480 --> 03:31:21.640]  an event that Donald Trump looked into, sparking the first impeachment, enforcing the arming of
[03:31:21.640 --> 03:31:26.519]  Ukraine, in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia. Evidence of the bribe was also
[03:31:26.519 --> 03:31:32.039]  in Hunter Biden's laptop, which the FBI also had, but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[03:31:32.039 --> 03:31:37.800]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign. All while the FBI investigates
[03:31:37.800 --> 03:31:42.039]  Trump for having classified documents, despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off
[03:31:42.039 --> 03:31:46.039]  for a similar charge in 2016, when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate
[03:31:46.039 --> 03:31:51.480]  investigation into Donald Trump using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[03:31:51.480 --> 03:31:52.840]  Do I have that all straight?
[03:31:56.439 --> 03:32:00.359]  The globalists are only humans. Yeah, they have control of the central banks,
[03:32:00.439 --> 03:32:04.199]  they have a lot of power, but they can be defeated. But some of their operations are
[03:32:04.199 --> 03:32:08.920]  going to take decades to stop. But one thing you can do right now is take control of your body
[03:32:08.920 --> 03:32:14.519]  and your family's body by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with. And you
[03:32:14.519 --> 03:32:19.960]  do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there. This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[03:32:19.960 --> 03:32:23.960]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day. It purifies very quickly,
[03:32:23.960 --> 03:32:28.039]  and it cuts out thousands of chemicals to non-detectable levels. This is what I use,
[03:32:28.039 --> 03:32:31.320]  which my family uses. It's the very best system out there for the lowest price,
[03:32:31.320 --> 03:32:37.480]  for a limited time, 10% off on top of that, exclusively at InfowarStore.com on the Alexa
[03:32:37.480 --> 03:32:42.119]  Pure water filtration system, in stock, and replacement filters for folks that need those
[03:32:42.119 --> 03:32:46.119]  in stock. Get it today, and it funds the Infowar. Don't procrastinate. This is one
[03:32:46.119 --> 03:32:50.519]  of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the globalists from hitting us
[03:32:50.519 --> 03:32:54.840]  with poison that they allow in the water supply. In some cases, they add the water supply like
[03:32:54.840 --> 03:33:05.880]  fluoride. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.100 --> 03:33:26.100]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:33:26.100 --> 03:33:34.140]  Hey, great being on The Alex Jones Show. Listen, everybody, do everything you can to
[03:33:34.140 --> 03:33:42.460]  support InfoWars, because the people at InfoWars are doing everything they can to support you.
[03:33:42.460 --> 03:33:53.140]  And media is dead. It's gone. Finito. There's no more journalism anymore. It's finished.
[03:33:53.140 --> 03:34:02.940]  All it is is propaganda. Because if you don't swallow the crap coming out of CNN with that
[03:34:02.940 --> 03:34:11.260]  doctor who bashed his head open after getting fully COVID shot and two variants, if you
[03:34:11.260 --> 03:34:21.140]  don't believe that crap, that's misinformation. Misinformation is if you don't believe crap.
[03:34:21.200 --> 03:34:31.760]  So do what you can to support InfoWars, and you know, I've been around a while, and I've
[03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:34.240]  been with presidents, prime ministers, and princes.
[03:34:35.800 --> 03:34:39.800]  And my sister, the one I brought up in the nursing home,
[03:34:39.800 --> 03:34:43.800]  she opened up the second-toppest go-go lounge in New York City,
[03:34:43.800 --> 03:34:45.800]  Grace's Lucky Lounge.
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:48.800]  And my sister lost three-quarters of her hand as a kid.
[03:34:48.800 --> 03:34:54.800]  And the doctor, a doctor like Wachtler, yeah, that kind of arrogant guy,
[03:34:54.800 --> 03:34:56.800]  they put the cast on wrong.
[03:34:56.800 --> 03:34:58.800]  And she's crying and crying and crying.
[03:34:58.800 --> 03:35:03.800]  And Dan Green said it, and she lost it because doctors were kings.
[03:35:03.800 --> 03:35:05.800]  They're kings!
[03:35:05.800 --> 03:35:08.800]  Yeah, like the prince becomes a king.
[03:35:08.800 --> 03:35:11.800]  So anyway, my sister had a rough life.
[03:35:11.800 --> 03:35:13.800]  So anyway, I've been with princes, prime ministers,
[03:35:13.800 --> 03:35:18.800]  worked in topless go-go lounges, and the stories keep going on.
[03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:22.800]  I've been on Oprah, I tell you, I've been around.
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:32.400]  And I've never seen a decline in society like I'm witnessing now.
[03:35:32.400 --> 03:35:38.400]  So everybody listening, and it took me a lot of years to understand this.
[03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:49.600]  If you don't do anything to make life on earth a better place,
[03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:53.600]  and you're only interested in loving yourself,
[03:35:54.400 --> 03:36:00.480]  I don't care what God you believe in, but to me, man,
[03:36:00.600 --> 03:36:09.760]  you ain't going to get out of here in a happy trip. And all you billionaires, all you billionaires
[03:36:09.760 --> 03:36:17.200]  that don't give a penny to peace, not a penny to occupy peace, all you multimillionaires
[03:36:17.200 --> 03:36:25.120]  that don't give a penny for peace, and you got locked jaw about it. When you die, make
[03:36:25.120 --> 03:36:31.120]  sure they make the coffin really, really big so they could pile the money in there. Of
[03:36:31.120 --> 03:36:37.480]  course, you'll take it with you. Oh, yeah. All those billions that you got, that you
[03:36:37.480 --> 03:36:45.120]  didn't do anything to improve life on Earth. You know, I'm waiting, as I'm waiting to
[03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:51.440]  go on air now, I'm watching the clip, and there's Bill Gates. How can anybody with a
[03:36:51.440 --> 03:36:58.320]  brain bigger than a pea look up to this arrogant little stupid clown boy? I made a lot of money.
[03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:07.840]  I'm a geek. I'm a freak. You should listen to me. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That's all we are.
[03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:14.320]  Plantation workers are the global plantation of slave land here. To everybody listening
[03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:21.160]  to InfoWars, you better do something. You better do something. By the way, there's going
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:27.000]  to be another peace rally. I forgot the date. I think it's October 5th or 6th at the United
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:30.280]  Nations. I'm going to be one of the speakers there along with Scott Ritter and others.
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:36.520]  I'll send you more information next time I'm on. I want to talk a bit about the economy.
[03:37:36.520 --> 03:37:46.080]  So the numbers came out last week, and consumer prices in June rose 3% from a year earlier.
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:48.640]  That's the numbers they're giving you, so everything is fine.
[03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:53.600]  But then you look at the real numbers.
[03:37:53.600 --> 03:37:59.600]  Grocery prices overall rose 4.7% in June.
[03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:08.600]  You think Gates and Buffett and Bezos are worried about grocery prices?
[03:38:08.600 --> 03:38:16.880]  You ready?
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:19.520]  Vehicle insurance, it only went up 17%.
[03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:25.520]  Oh, and there's no inflation, there's no inflation.
[03:38:25.520 --> 03:38:30.320]  Getting your car fixed went up nearly 13% in June.
[03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:35.920]  The automobiles are moronically geek screwed up.
[03:38:35.920 --> 03:38:38.520]  Can't open the trunk, gotta open it by itself.
[03:38:38.520 --> 03:38:43.360]  Beep, beep, beep, can't put that key in the door to lock it, don't roll down that window.
[03:38:43.360 --> 03:38:48.640]  Oh no, everything gotta be electronicized, stupitized.
[03:38:48.700 --> 03:39:00.300]  Prices for renting a primary residence up 8.3 percent.
[03:39:00.300 --> 03:39:05.180]  There's no inflation, Salenti, what are you talking about?
[03:39:05.180 --> 03:39:18.180]  You're getting some colleges, $95,000 a year, $95,000 a year, what, to get a degree in gender
[03:39:18.180 --> 03:39:20.380]  studies?
[03:39:20.380 --> 03:39:28.180]  I got my breasts cut off, I got my testicles removed, and now I'm a they-them.
[03:39:28.180 --> 03:39:31.180]  Oh, how about getting one in art history?
[03:39:31.180 --> 03:39:36.180]  Hey, how about spending money to get a degree in trend forecasting?
[03:39:36.180 --> 03:39:40.180]  What the hell are you talking about?
[03:39:40.180 --> 03:39:42.740]  Harvard, $95,000 a year?
[03:39:42.740 --> 03:39:44.860]  We don't teach trend forecasting, how come?
[03:39:44.860 --> 03:39:50.300]  Because we don't know how to, but you could get a degree in art history.
[03:39:50.300 --> 03:39:52.740]  What happened in 1727?
[03:39:52.740 --> 03:39:55.020]  How about 1133?
[03:39:55.020 --> 03:39:56.860]  We got a test, make sure you put the right answers.
[03:39:56.860 --> 03:39:59.180]  Yeah, but what's going to happen in the future?
[03:39:59.180 --> 03:40:00.180]  We don't know.
[03:40:00.180 --> 03:40:01.180]  Oh, yeah?
[03:40:01.180 --> 03:40:04.380]  That's because you never read trend tracking.
[03:40:04.380 --> 03:40:10.060]  Far better than Megatrends, Time Magazine, one of my books.
[03:40:10.060 --> 03:40:14.540]  The Trends Journal, the only magazine in the world that gives you history before it happens,
[03:40:15.220 --> 03:40:18.460]  the truth and trends that they don't know anything about.
[03:40:18.460 --> 03:40:21.940]  Grand total, $2.86 a week and no advertising.
[03:40:21.940 --> 03:40:29.140]  So going back to what's going on, talking about colleges going up in inflation.
[03:40:29.140 --> 03:40:31.380]  You ready for this?
[03:40:31.380 --> 03:40:42.580]  After adjusting for currency inflation, college tuition has increased 747.8% since 1963, according
[03:40:42.620 --> 03:40:46.740]  to Education Data Initiative.
[03:40:46.740 --> 03:40:57.180]  In 1920, in 2021, the top 10% of Americans control nearly 70% of America's wealth, up
[03:40:57.180 --> 03:41:06.340]  from 61% in 1989, as the plantation workers of Slavelandia get poorer.
[03:41:06.340 --> 03:41:08.980]  That's according to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[03:41:08.980 --> 03:41:16.620]  The top 1%, they own 20% of all the income in the United States, according to the Economic
[03:41:16.620 --> 03:41:18.300]  Policy Institute.
[03:41:18.300 --> 03:41:23.780]  And better than that, before adjusting for inflation, the average student loan debt at
[03:41:23.780 --> 03:41:35.540]  graduation, you ready, has increased by 2,807% since 1970, according to EDI.
[03:41:39.300 --> 03:41:48.580]  And after you get your degree, you could get a job working at Walmart, or maybe you want
[03:41:48.580 --> 03:41:50.500]  to work at Home Depot.
[03:41:50.500 --> 03:41:51.500]  I think Lowe's.
[03:41:51.500 --> 03:41:53.660]  I'd rather go to Lowe's.
[03:41:53.660 --> 03:41:56.380]  How about Target?
[03:41:56.380 --> 03:42:02.619]  The bigs have taken over everything, all over the world.
[03:42:02.619 --> 03:42:04.939]  I'm a fighter.
[03:42:04.939 --> 03:42:06.460]  I'm a fighter for freedom.
[03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:11.500]  And so are the people at InfoWars.
[03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:17.500]  So stand up and fight peacefully, peacefully for freedom.
[03:42:17.500 --> 03:42:27.500]  Because if we unite against them, it's a whole new world order, the way it should be.
[03:42:27.500 --> 03:42:32.500]  And by the way, I'm still for RFK Jr.
[03:42:32.500 --> 03:42:38.500]  And I know his campaign manager, Dennis Kucinich, he spoke at my rally here on May 27.
[03:42:38.500 --> 03:42:42.500]  And I spoke to RFK recently.
[03:42:42.500 --> 03:42:45.500]  So I'm still standing with him.
[03:42:45.500 --> 03:42:48.500]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:48.500 --> 03:42:52.500]  And again, stand with InfoWars, because they're standing for you.
[03:42:52.500 --> 03:43:03.500]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[03:43:03.500 --> 03:43:09.500]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[03:43:09.500 --> 03:43:13.500]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine.
[03:43:13.500 --> 03:43:18.500]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you
[03:43:18.500 --> 03:43:21.500]  and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[03:43:21.500 --> 03:43:23.500]  Look it up.
[03:43:23.500 --> 03:43:24.500]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[03:43:24.500 --> 03:43:30.500]  We have the very best gravity-fed filter system out there, highest rated at half the price of leading competitors,
[03:43:30.500 --> 03:43:33.500]  the Alexa Pure, ready to ship to you right now.
[03:43:33.500 --> 03:43:35.500]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[03:43:35.500 --> 03:43:37.500]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[03:43:37.500 --> 03:43:38.500]  It is amazing.
[03:43:38.500 --> 03:43:40.500]  It's great for your home, your business.
[03:43:40.500 --> 03:43:43.500]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[03:43:43.500 --> 03:43:44.500]  Almost everything is contaminated.
[03:43:44.500 --> 03:43:48.500]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter the globalist onslaught.
[03:43:48.500 --> 03:43:51.500]  Get yours today at Infowarsstore.com for a limited time.

[03:43:52.500 --> 03:43:53.500]  That is a huge discount.
[03:43:53.500 --> 03:43:55.500]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[03:43:55.500 --> 03:43:56.500]  You need this filter.
[03:43:56.500 --> 03:44:01.500]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:04.500]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[03:44:04.500 --> 03:44:09.500]  the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:44:09.500 --> 03:44:12.500]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[03:44:12.500 --> 03:44:15.500]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowarsstore.com,
[03:44:15.500 --> 03:44:19.500]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.

[03:44:22.500 --> 03:44:26.500]  so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time,

[03:44:40.500 --> 03:44:44.500]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now
[03:44:44.500 --> 03:44:49.500]  and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset
[03:44:49.500 --> 03:44:53.500]  by going to Infowarsstore.com and clicking on the Donate button and giving today.
[03:44:53.500 --> 03:44:56.500]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[03:44:56.500 --> 03:45:00.500]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[03:45:00.500 --> 03:45:05.500]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy,
[03:45:05.500 --> 03:45:11.500]  you are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high-quality storable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[03:45:11.500 --> 03:45:13.500]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[03:45:13.500 --> 03:45:16.500]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't,
[03:45:16.500 --> 03:45:18.500]  and I'm preaching the choir on that.
[03:45:18.500 --> 03:45:22.500]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:45:22.500 --> 03:45:26.500]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department
[03:45:26.500 --> 03:45:29.500]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[03:45:29.500 --> 03:45:34.500]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going to find and still get quality.
[03:45:34.500 --> 03:45:42.500]  Infowarsstore.com is running a special right now for 10% off on all storable food and on water and air filtration.
[03:45:42.500 --> 03:45:45.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[03:45:45.500 --> 03:45:49.500]  Our prices are already the lowest. At 10% off, it's an insane deal for a limited time.
[03:45:49.500 --> 03:45:54.500]  Go to Infowarsstore.com and get prepared while you still can.
[03:45:56.500 --> 03:46:01.500]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:46:01.500 --> 03:46:03.500]  We made it even stronger.
[03:46:03.500 --> 03:46:07.500]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[03:46:07.500 --> 03:46:14.500]  Turbo Force is back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:14.500 --> 03:46:20.500]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:46:20.500 --> 03:46:22.500]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:46:22.500 --> 03:46:27.500]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[03:46:27.500 --> 03:46:33.500]  that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[03:46:33.500 --> 03:46:36.500]  It is the super fuel.
[03:46:36.500 --> 03:46:39.500]  Rain Force Plus is great. Rain Force Ultra is great.
[03:46:39.500 --> 03:46:41.500]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[03:46:41.500 --> 03:46:44.500]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:46:44.500 --> 03:46:45.500]  This is the boss.
[03:46:45.500 --> 03:46:50.500]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:46:50.500 --> 03:46:53.500]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[03:46:57.500 --> 03:47:04.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:36.000 --> 03:47:39.000]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:43.000]  You know, like I was just saying, you know, you've got to do everything you can to support Infowars.
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  You get these great products, too.
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  You know, again, if you don't believe everything the government tells you, it's misinformation.
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  By the way, which I find misinformation, I find that that's anti-woman.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  It should be gender information.
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  We've got to make it equal.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:06.000]  Anyway, the stupidity of all of it.
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:10.000]  So do what you can to support Infowars, because they're doing everything they can to support you.
[03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:12.000]  And they've got some great sales coming up.
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:19.000]  And right now, they have the July Patriot Pride Month at Infowars store.

[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:32.000]  And it's the best deals of the year.
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:35.000]  You get these deals all month long.

[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:29.000]  And all of Infowars ND products, 30 percent off.
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:34.000]  And all food, water, and air filtration products, 10 percent off.
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:37.000]  And again, it's a 360 win.
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  You get these super high-quality items, and you help launch Infowar into the next level.
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:48.000]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  And again, you know, when you look at these products, you know, particularly the food, water, and air filtration,
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:50:02.000]  you know, we're writing in the Trends Journal this week about all the damage from these telephone companies.
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  And all the poison in the earth, and the lead that's seeping out and going into the whole water supply
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  from the cables that used to be all covered with lead.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  And then we have an article in this week's Trends Journal about all the forever chemicals
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:24.000]  in nearly 50 percent of the water.
[03:50:24.000 --> 03:50:28.000]  Fifty percent of the water is poison.
[03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  And that doesn't count all of the drugs, all of the prescription drugs that are in the water system.
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:38.000]  So, you know, to me, you know, I want to filter this stuff out.
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  I don't want to have it.
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  And they have the products to keep you healthy there.
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  So do what you can to support Infowars because they're doing what they can to support you.
[03:50:49.900 --> 03:50:53.900]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:50:53.900 --> 03:50:55.900]  All right.
[03:50:55.900 --> 03:50:57.900]  So going back to the economy.
[03:50:57.900 --> 03:50:59.900]  Patriot Pride Month.
[03:50:59.900 --> 03:51:01.900]  I am a patriot.
[03:51:01.900 --> 03:51:03.900]  I'm a true American.
[03:51:03.900 --> 03:51:05.900]  I believe in the founding fathers.
[03:51:05.900 --> 03:51:07.900]  I am not stupid enough.
[03:51:07.900 --> 03:51:09.900]  I am not brain-dead
[03:51:09.900 --> 03:51:11.900]  to listen to the clown.
[03:51:11.900 --> 03:51:13.900]  You know, this slob,
[03:51:13.900 --> 03:51:15.900]  this little jerk over there,
[03:51:15.900 --> 03:51:17.900]  this little nothing-of-a-character clown
[03:51:17.900 --> 03:51:19.900]  over there in Jersey,
[03:51:19.900 --> 03:51:21.900]  Chris Christie,
[03:51:21.900 --> 03:51:23.900]  he's running for president, right?
[03:51:23.900 --> 03:51:25.900]  Slobby boy.
[03:51:26.000 --> 03:51:31.000]  He's interviewed by
[03:51:32.200 --> 03:51:35.100]  this woman.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:42.000]  Who was it? I think Maria... Son of a... He says... He goes...
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  I know Zelensky... He goes...
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  I want... I want to have every weapon they need to be able to win.
[03:51:51.200 --> 03:51:57.200]  And this is a proxy war, not against Russia, but as you know, it's a proxy war against China.
[03:51:57.200 --> 03:51:59.200]  Proxy war?
[03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:01.200]  Who declared war?
[03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:07.200]  A fat boy, a slobby, a blimpo.
[03:52:07.200 --> 03:52:09.200]  You couldn't do that.
[03:52:09.200 --> 03:52:11.200]  You couldn't do that.
[03:52:12.200 --> 03:52:14.200]  Who declared war?
[03:52:14.200 --> 03:52:19.200]  A fat boy, a slobby, a blimpo.
[03:52:19.200 --> 03:52:24.200]  You couldn't fight your way out of a paper bag, but you love war, don't you?
[03:52:24.200 --> 03:52:34.200]  Anybody that wants to go support Ukraine, put on your drag, go over there and fight and shut your mouth.
[03:52:34.200 --> 03:52:44.200]  Look at this slobby piece of arrogant crap who's been sucking off the public tit as whole life, telling people what to do.
[03:52:44.200 --> 03:52:48.200]  Look at this little arrogant jerk.
[03:52:48.100 --> 03:53:01.100]  The job of a leader, he said, is not to follow polls, it's to change polls.
[03:53:01.100 --> 03:53:02.100]  Leader?
[03:53:02.100 --> 03:53:04.100]  You a leader?
[03:53:04.100 --> 03:53:13.100]  Hey everybody, how stupid can you be to let these political jerks lead you?
[03:53:14.900 --> 03:53:19.900]  Get it in your head, fat boy!
[03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:23.900]  You're a public servant.
[03:53:24.900 --> 03:53:28.900]  I lead you. I pay you.
[03:53:29.400 --> 03:53:34.400]  He goes on.
[03:53:34.100 --> 03:53:44.560]  We can spend this money now and have Ukraine soldiers fight our war.
[03:53:44.560 --> 03:53:45.560]  Look at this.
[03:53:45.560 --> 03:53:46.780]  That's when he wasn't.
[03:53:46.780 --> 03:53:52.660]  That's when they locked down all the beaches and slobby over there and his family were
[03:53:52.660 --> 03:53:57.580]  going out into Jersey Shore as everybody else was locked down.
[03:53:57.580 --> 03:54:00.380]  Look at this slobby piece of crap.
[03:54:00.380 --> 03:54:04.660]  You want to go to war, go fight or shut your fat mouth.
[03:54:05.400 --> 03:54:08.400]  We could spend this money now and have Ukraine soldiers fight.
[03:54:08.400 --> 03:54:10.400]  It's not our war, fatty.
[03:54:11.400 --> 03:54:15.400]  Or we could spend a lot more money and have American blood later fight in Taiwan.
[03:54:15.400 --> 03:54:16.400]  Oh, you're going to go fight?
[03:54:16.400 --> 03:54:17.400]  Oh, you're going to go fight?
[03:54:17.400 --> 03:54:19.400]  You're going to go send your kids to fight?
[03:54:19.400 --> 03:54:20.400]  No.
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:22.400]  No.
[03:54:22.400 --> 03:54:25.400]  Senator's sons never send anybody to fight.
[03:54:27.400 --> 03:54:30.400]  And then they had another guy, that pencil head, Pence.
[03:54:30.400 --> 03:54:32.400]  Interviewed by Tucker Carlson.
[03:54:33.400 --> 03:54:37.400]  I believe that it is in the interest of the United States of America
[03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:42.400]  to continue to give Ukraine military the resources they need
[03:54:42.400 --> 03:54:45.400]  to repel Russian invasion and restore their sovereignty.
[03:54:45.400 --> 03:54:47.400]  Hey, you believe it?
[03:54:47.400 --> 03:54:49.400]  Go over there and send your money.
[03:54:49.400 --> 03:54:51.400]  I don't believe it.
[03:54:51.400 --> 03:54:53.400]  I don't believe it.
[03:54:53.400 --> 03:54:55.400]  Hey, hey, I know what.
[03:54:55.400 --> 03:54:56.400]  I don't believe it.
[03:54:56.400 --> 03:54:58.400]  Hey, hey, I know what.
[03:54:58.400 --> 03:55:01.400]  You are too damn stupid
[03:55:03.400 --> 03:55:08.400]  to have read our Trends Journal from back in 2014
[03:55:09.400 --> 03:55:14.400]  when we detailed the overthrow of the democratically elected government
[03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:19.400]  of Viktor Yanukovych by Victoria Nuland, another war mongering.
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:21.400]  If only women were in charge.
[03:55:21.400 --> 03:55:24.400]  And Barack, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Obama.
[03:55:24.900 --> 03:55:29.900]  In violation of the Minsk Agreement later on.
[03:55:29.900 --> 03:55:37.260]  Oh, and the promise that NATO would not move one inch further, the deal made between Bush
[03:55:37.260 --> 03:55:47.260]  Sr. and Gorbachev in the breakup of the Soviet Union, 16 NATO countries then, nearly double,
[03:55:47.260 --> 03:55:57.500]  32 now, our money, NATO, no need for it, no need for it.
[03:55:57.500 --> 03:56:02.580]  And then listen to this jerk, listen to this pencil-head jerk.
[03:56:02.580 --> 03:56:07.859]  Anybody that says that we can't be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at
[03:56:07.859 --> 03:56:11.060]  home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on earth.
[03:56:11.060 --> 03:56:13.619]  Don't you tell me I have a small view.
[03:56:13.619 --> 03:56:15.580]  And guess what?
[03:56:15.580 --> 03:56:19.460]  We are not the leader of the free world.
[03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:25.699]  We lost our freedom, screwball.
[03:56:25.699 --> 03:56:27.619]  No vax, no job.
[03:56:27.619 --> 03:56:28.940]  No vax, no school.
[03:56:29.000 --> 03:56:35.160]  Look at this little clown of nothing, a little boy of nothing.
[03:56:35.160 --> 03:56:37.200]  And that's who we have running us.
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:38.400]  A lot more, a lot more.
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:41.680]  I don't have time to talk about it, what's going on in China.
[03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:43.080]  This thing's going down big.
[03:56:43.080 --> 03:56:45.720]  It's not only the Chinese economy is going down.
[03:56:45.720 --> 03:56:48.400]  You look at the data and your data is in your Trends Journal.
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:53.960]  By the way, you go to TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com and buy the t-shirt I have over here, by the
[03:56:53.960 --> 03:56:54.960]  way.
[03:56:55.120 --> 03:57:01.280]  You can get these, hey, politician, who the F are you to tell us what to do?
[03:57:01.280 --> 03:57:08.000]  And you know, I feel it, say it and print it anyway.
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:10.400]  You look at the data going on.
[03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:13.440]  It's not only China's economy, Vietnam.
[03:57:13.440 --> 03:57:15.000]  It's one after another.
[03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:16.120]  They're all losing.
[03:57:16.120 --> 03:57:21.800]  They're all going down the sales, imports, exports.
[03:57:21.800 --> 03:57:24.360]  It's a global crisis underway.
[03:57:24.360 --> 03:57:29.000]  And the worst is yet to come when the office building bust happens.
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:31.880]  We haven't seen the beginning of the banking crisis.
[03:57:31.880 --> 03:57:35.280]  Again, don't have a lot of time to talk about it.
[03:57:35.280 --> 03:57:40.240]  It's in your Trends Journal, TrendsJournal.com, the grand total of $2.86 a week.
[03:57:40.240 --> 03:57:43.720]  And again, support InfoWars because InfoWars is supporting you.
[03:57:45.600 --> 03:57:48.600]  Hey everybody, Rodney Albarn here.
[03:57:48.600 --> 03:57:53.600]  I want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for offering scholarships to River University.
[03:57:53.600 --> 03:58:01.600]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today and you don't know what to do with the problems that we face in the world today.
[03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:05.600]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023.
[03:58:05.600 --> 03:58:12.600]  But here at River University, not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.
[03:58:12.600 --> 03:58:19.600]  Come, a full three-year bachelor degree will train you up in ministry, government, worship,
[03:58:19.600 --> 03:58:24.600]  that you can go out and actually bring about a transformation in the earth today.
[03:58:24.600 --> 03:58:30.600]  We have graduates going all over the world, from the Arctic to the outback, and right here, this is what we do.
[03:58:30.600 --> 03:58:37.600]  We specialize in training people and equipping them for transformation, and that's what you'll do.
[03:58:37.600 --> 03:58:46.600]  So scan the QR code right now or go to riveruniversity.org and get the free scholarship offered to you by InfoWars.
[03:58:46.600 --> 03:58:53.600]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:58:53.600 --> 03:58:55.600]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:58:55.600 --> 03:58:56.600]  It is.
[03:58:56.600 --> 03:59:00.600]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:59:00.600 --> 03:59:02.600]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:59:02.600 --> 03:59:04.600]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:59:04.600 --> 03:59:09.600]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:09.600 --> 03:59:13.600]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[03:59:13.600 --> 03:59:14.600]  You want something like this?
[03:59:14.600 --> 03:59:15.600]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:15.600 --> 03:59:17.600]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:59:17.600 --> 03:59:18.600]  It's so good, in my view.
[03:59:18.600 --> 03:59:20.600]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:59:20.600 --> 03:59:23.600]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:59:23.600 --> 03:59:26.600]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:26.600 --> 03:59:32.600]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:33.600 --> 03:59:37.600]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess,
[03:59:37.600 --> 03:59:40.600]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:40.600 --> 03:59:41.600]  I just can't do it.
[03:59:41.600 --> 03:59:43.600]  Infowarsstore.com
