[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]  The recent fires in California, Australia, and now Hawaii are unlike anything we've ever seen before.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  They are being called forest fires and wildfires, but they are clearly something very different.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  These fires are burning homes into a white powdery ash footprint, while often leaving the surrounding green trees and shrubs practically untouched.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  In extreme cases, forest fires can reach temperatures up to 1500 degrees Fahrenheit, and the melting point of aluminum is 1220 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  So it is possible for an extreme forest fire to melt aluminum.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  But there are cars with puddles of melted aluminum that were clearly not in the wildfire area.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  And melted glass, which has a melting point around 2500 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  These are unexplained anomalies.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  In the California fires of 2018, cars were randomly bursting into flames on the freeway with no surrounding fires.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  We've seen these same anomalies in New York City on September 11th, 2001.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  Cars completely burned out with no explanation.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  In Maui, these unnatural fires spared the homes of the rich, while burning the native homes of the working class.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  With precision, these fires destroyed the most envied, high-valued areas of Maui.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  For decades, directed energy weapons have been classified, but they have been on the public record for several years now.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  Directed energy weapons, known as DEWS, have the ability to burn homes with this sort of precision.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]  But in order to be this precise, the area would have to be mapped out.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  In January of this year, green lasers were seen over Hawaii, which could best be described as a geospatial array for mapping terrain.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  We have seen that among the ashy ruins, there are blue colored objects that have somehow survived the devastation.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  Blue cars, blue umbrellas, a blue boat, blue planters.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  Videos online are going viral that show how lasers can easily burn through certain colored objects.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  But objects that are colored blue remain unharmed.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]  Directed energy weapons include lasers, millimeter wave, and microwave.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  They are all based on light frequencies, and different wavelengths of light affect colors differently.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  For example, in laser tattoo removal, different wavelengths are used for removing different colors.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  And this is because color is a quality of light. Each color has its own frequency.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  Interestingly enough, the frequency of the color blue is 6.66.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  So, we came out here an hour ago, and not one leftist would defend the mask of the shots for the coherent argument.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  None of them could shake my mind about not wanting the COVID charity protocol to come back.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  Send me your non-binary quadruple bags!
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  Champion! Tell me why we need their mandates, and their lockdowns, and five masks!
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  I didn't take a shot, and I'm thankful for you for doing that. I didn't do that because you awakened me to a lot of things.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  How are you doing?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  Good, how are you?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  Tell us real quick, would you like to wear a mask together if I bring the mandates back?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]  I do not want to wear a mask.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  So you're not? Well, come tell us!
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]  No, no, no.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  You won't? Well, you better speak up. They're coming to do it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]  So, I'd say what? Five to one are against it?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  Four shots! Four shots! You want more shots?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  You need a hug!
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  You need more shots! I do! Come give me a hug!
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  Please don't hurt the baby. Please don't give the boys the shots.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  Alex Jones turned out to be right, and Bill Gates, and Fauci, and Claude Schwab.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  They turned out to be wrong because they were lying on purpose, and they need to go to prison for what they've done!
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  But the leftists, they don't like us.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  They want us to shut up. They want to shut you up, but we're not going to shut up because we're a mug club.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  We have only begun to fight in the information war, and we will never surrender!
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]  Never surrender!
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  Good. You there, in the black Ford truck. Are you planning to take more shots?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  People want it, and it funds our operation of 360 Wind.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  Bodies, ultimate, turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  Jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  I mean, it's just so amazing. God gave it to us, and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid. Most brands are 5% humanoid, and that still does a great thing for you.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]  This is the strongest anybody makes, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  I am so glad this is back. I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  Bodies, ultimate, turmeric formula, back in stock, 25% off.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:57.725 --> 00:06:08.165]  This transmission is coming to you, it's Friday, September 1st, 2023.
[00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:13.005]  Get locked in logic box on corruption.
[00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:25.725]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowars.
[00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:37.285]  Well, the gaslighting witch that is the White House press secretary has outdone herself
[00:06:37.285 --> 00:06:38.285]  every day.
[00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:39.285]  It's totally insane.
[00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:42.705]  Monday through Friday, when she gets up to the lectern and just spews the most insane
[00:06:42.705 --> 00:06:49.845]  lies ever, got about 10 of them here today that are just each one total whoppers.
[00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:51.405]  But she told the truth about a couple of things.
[00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:56.305]  She said, oh, we are looking to bring back the mask and contact tracing and the testing
[00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:58.385]  and all the rest of the garbage.
[00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.705]  She said it yesterday.
[00:07:00.705 --> 00:07:03.225]  And she said, Biden wants you to take your shot.
[00:07:03.225 --> 00:07:04.225]  He's your doctor.
[00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:10.685]  And they've just got a new one coming out in 14 days today, September 1st, 2023 on
[00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:15.785]  September 15th, magically, what we told you two weeks ago today, they'd start the real
[00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:19.725]  rollout on September 15th, unless they decide to change it or back off.
[00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:23.065]  And then the media will say, Jones predicted this, it didn't happen.
[00:07:23.065 --> 00:07:28.625]  But you've already seen the full court press and people are picking up everywhere, NPR
[00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:31.985]  saying we need new lockdowns yesterday.
[00:07:31.985 --> 00:07:34.145]  I've got a stack of these.
[00:07:34.145 --> 00:07:36.945]  And so we do have to get out ahead of it.
[00:07:36.945 --> 00:07:39.825]  I agree with Tucker that they're going to have a hell of a time doing it.
[00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:42.545]  And people aren't going to comply.
[00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.625]  As I told you, I went out yesterday on a hike and bike trail in downtown Austin, right
[00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:49.605]  in the middle of the river, they've got a big pedestrian bridge and hundreds
[00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:54.605]  of people went by, 95% thumbs up, or we don't want to wear a mask.
[00:07:54.605 --> 00:07:55.605]  People have responded to us.
[00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:58.005]  A lot of folks have their ear bugs in and just ignored us.
[00:07:58.005 --> 00:08:00.005]  But a lot of people responded.
[00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:05.425]  I'd say about 15 people said, FU and you need to take more shots.
[00:08:05.425 --> 00:08:06.425]  We want masks to come back.
[00:08:06.425 --> 00:08:08.645]  And I was asking, why not?
[00:08:08.645 --> 00:08:13.865]  That video just went live at Steven Crowder's website, louder with Crowder.com.
[00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:14.865]  It's powerful.
[00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:20.525]  And it's also a review of the last three and a half years of COVID tyranny.
[00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:26.025]  But we'll also have some big excerpts for you here on air for the general audience.
[00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:27.025]  But Jones Crowder.com.
[00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:31.145]  If you want to support the broadcast, support more shows, more reporters, and really be
[00:08:31.145 --> 00:08:34.865]  part of the tip of the spear even more, go to JonesCrowder.com, get a free month
[00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:36.745]  off when you sign up there.
[00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:40.665]  Just get access to the new show I'm doing there.
[00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:44.405]  But get access to all of Steven Crowder's shows and all of his great team and other
[00:08:44.945 --> 00:08:46.285]  producers material there.
[00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:50.585]  There's more than 10 different hosts there now, including the amazing Hodge Brothers,
[00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:52.245]  the Hodge twins.
[00:08:52.245 --> 00:08:53.885]  Okay.
[00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:56.605]  Let me do this because I did an okay job yesterday.
[00:08:56.605 --> 00:09:00.125]  I got to about 70% of the news.
[00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:02.005]  I at least mentioned some.
[00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:05.985]  And we did a deep dive on five or six topics and had some big, informative guests.
[00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:10.885]  I've cleared the slate of guests today so we can cover all this news.
[00:09:10.885 --> 00:09:16.845]  I think I can get to, if I'm focused, and I'm going to try to be most of this by the
[00:09:16.845 --> 00:09:17.845]  middle of the next hour.
[00:09:17.845 --> 00:09:19.325]  So an hour and a half from now, roughly.
[00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.925]  Then we can open the phones up, plus new news is constantly breaking.
[00:09:22.925 --> 00:09:26.285]  We'll bring you all that as it unfolds on this Friday transmission.
[00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:33.605]  So let me be a good boy and break down what we're going to be hitting here.
[00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:35.045]  Lockdown 2.0s are here.
[00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:37.285]  They're definitely trying to implement it again.
[00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:42.965]  We're going to be rolling all of that out.
[00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:47.685]  James Woods has gone completely Alex Jones, as they're saying.
[00:09:47.685 --> 00:09:48.925]  They're calling him Alex Jones 2.0.
[00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:49.925]  I'm very honored.
[00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:50.925]  I love James Woods.
[00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:54.885]  One of my favorite actors always, but also a patriot, a nationalist, and just an amazing
[00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:55.885]  person.
[00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:56.885]  Did a great job producing Oppenheimer.
[00:09:56.885 --> 00:09:57.885]  Don't agree with everything in the movie.
[00:09:57.885 --> 00:10:01.005]  It's not completely accurate from what I know, but it's a good movie.
[00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:02.005]  That's a side issue.
[00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:04.765]  One of the more good people that's ever come out of Hollywood.
[00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:10.805]  He's come out in a whole bunch of tweets and a video and said that there's a new world
[00:10:10.805 --> 00:10:14.845]  order, global government, corporations are at war with you and they're putting invisible
[00:10:14.845 --> 00:10:17.605]  digital chains on you.
[00:10:17.605 --> 00:10:22.205]  And the COVID controls are about a global digital ID to enslave you and your family.
[00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.325]  Now you're like, okay, tell us something we don't know.
[00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:33.165]  I can't really think of anybody now who hasn't come out against all this crap.
[00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:34.165]  And it's funny.
[00:10:34.565 --> 00:10:38.405]  I'm one of the people I liked, even though I didn't know their politics when I was younger.
[00:10:38.405 --> 00:10:43.605]  But I mean, it's, if you start thinking about the fact that whether Vivek Ramanwani
[00:10:43.605 --> 00:10:49.325]  is good or not, he's extremely articulate and is Alex Jones 2.0.
[00:10:49.325 --> 00:10:54.085]  I mean, he just, it's like, I'm a major presidential candidate or you are as a listener.
[00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:59.365]  I mean, he's anti new world order, anti WF, anti COVID tyranny, anti central bank digital
[00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:04.645]  currency, the tyranny of the left and the tyranny of the minority and the weaponization
[00:11:04.645 --> 00:11:07.445]  of the judiciary.
[00:11:07.445 --> 00:11:09.965]  He knows that's popular, whether he's good or not.
[00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:13.725]  Hey, he used to be more of a liberal.
[00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:16.125]  He's allowed to defect over to us.
[00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:22.165]  Everybody's so mad at him and so angry at him that he's not perfect or Oliver Anthony.
[00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:27.165]  Yeah, he's kind of a leftist becoming more of a populist and he's not perfect.
[00:11:27.165 --> 00:11:28.165]  His background's not perfect.
[00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:34.125]  Just because we embraced his song and catapulted him to stardom, said some nice things about
[00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:38.525]  me on Joe Rogan when he was here in town a few days ago, let's give them the benefit
[00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:39.525]  of the doubt.
[00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:40.565]  You know, it's the same thing with Trump.
[00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:41.605]  He's getting better and better.
[00:11:41.605 --> 00:11:43.205]  He's getting super hardcore.
[00:11:43.205 --> 00:11:45.825]  They certainly want to destroy him.
[00:11:45.825 --> 00:11:50.205]  Would you rather Joe Biden or Gavin Newsom or big Mike?
[00:11:50.205 --> 00:11:53.485]  So these are some of the discussions we'll have.
[00:11:53.485 --> 00:12:08.845]  So they've come out with this UNWEF run 40 cities initiative and it's very serious to
[00:12:08.845 --> 00:12:09.845]  see 40 initiative.
[00:12:09.845 --> 00:12:16.585]  We've been covering it for about a year and it's run by the UN and people hear us
[00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:21.565]  read this stuff and they think, oh, this is just some kooky group.
[00:12:21.565 --> 00:12:24.725]  No, it's right out of the UN, right out of the WEF.
[00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:27.165]  That's who funds it, who runs it, it's why the production's the same.
[00:12:27.165 --> 00:12:28.965]  So I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:34.825]  This will be the change my mind I'm going to do on the street next week.
[00:12:34.825 --> 00:12:37.725]  Are you willing to give up all meat and dairy consumption?
[00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:38.725]  That's official.
[00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:42.045]  Austin's trying to implement this where I live.
[00:12:42.045 --> 00:12:48.325]  Are you willing to let government dictate how much clothes you can buy?
[00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:51.325]  Are you willing to give up your privately owned vehicle?
[00:12:51.325 --> 00:12:55.405]  Are you willing to accept one digital currency controlled by central banks that decides what
[00:12:55.405 --> 00:12:58.565]  you are allowed to purchase?
[00:12:58.565 --> 00:13:04.005]  Now when you go to their site, it's the Chinese Communist Party head.
[00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:12.285]  It's Sadiq Khan of London, I mean, it's the Austin mayor, it's all of them and they
[00:13:12.285 --> 00:13:16.925]  control the money because BlackRock is financing it.
[00:13:16.925 --> 00:13:22.845]  They also want to make you not have power at night saying you don't need power, that
[00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:23.845]  will save the earth.
[00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.845]  You saw they announced that in London just two days ago.
[00:13:26.845 --> 00:13:30.885]  So it sounds completely insane because it is.
[00:13:30.885 --> 00:13:39.745]  Just like a few years ago, Bill Gates said I want to block the sun out with satellites
[00:13:39.745 --> 00:13:45.085]  and big arrays in space with mirrors and with geoengineering chemtrails, of course
[00:13:45.245 --> 00:13:49.405]  already testing it for a long time, since the mid 90s and it's an admitted program,
[00:13:49.405 --> 00:13:50.645]  they just don't call it chemtrails.
[00:13:50.645 --> 00:13:55.765]  So chemtrails don't exist because that's the vernacular, that's the popular parlance,
[00:13:55.765 --> 00:14:04.285]  that's the commoner speak, not the uber mentioned word, but it's geoengineering and they're
[00:14:04.285 --> 00:14:08.405]  officially all over the news now today, even worse than yesterday, it's time to cut
[00:14:08.405 --> 00:14:10.525]  the trees down.
[00:14:10.525 --> 00:14:11.685]  Trees are bad.
[00:14:11.685 --> 00:14:15.925]  So it all ties together and folks, if they can tell you two men can have a baby and that
[00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:19.645]  two women can have a baby in prison and that men can be in women's sports, that men and
[00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:24.165]  women are the same physiologically, and they can cut the trees down telling you
[00:14:24.165 --> 00:14:27.145]  trees are bad, they can do anything.
[00:14:27.145 --> 00:14:30.425]  So you hear this stuff and you're like, what?
[00:14:30.425 --> 00:14:32.605]  That can't be real.
[00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:33.805]  Well what did Biden say a month ago?
[00:14:33.805 --> 00:14:37.965]  He said billions of dollars will now go toward blocking out the sun.
[00:14:37.965 --> 00:14:43.725]  So they're blocking the carbon dioxide, they're going after the sun, all that's
[00:14:43.725 --> 00:14:50.685]  left is water and oxygen, and when you cut trees down, you destroy even more oxygen.
[00:14:50.685 --> 00:14:57.485]  So they are officially now going after everything but water.
[00:14:57.485 --> 00:15:00.645]  And I guess they think, well, we'll have to really dumb them down more before they
[00:15:00.645 --> 00:15:01.925]  think water is bad.
[00:15:01.925 --> 00:15:05.205]  So everybody, even the dumbest person knows water is good.
[00:15:06.045 --> 00:15:11.645]  You need it to lift, that you're 70% water or whatever it is, depending on the person.
[00:15:11.645 --> 00:15:13.365]  Like look at it, what percentage are we water?
[00:15:13.365 --> 00:15:15.405]  I think it's like 70%.
[00:15:15.405 --> 00:15:20.565]  So yes, we're the carbon they want to cut.
[00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:22.525]  So we've got that.
[00:15:22.525 --> 00:15:24.565]  And I've only mentioned four of the stacks.
[00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:33.285]  We have just incredible news here of the ADL, ban the ADL trending.
[00:15:33.285 --> 00:15:37.325]  Now we're not like the ADL, we don't want to ban people and arrest people, and we're
[00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:39.205]  not pro-Hitler like they are, literally.
[00:15:39.205 --> 00:15:44.005]  They're the most pro-Hitler organization I've ever seen in action.
[00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:47.725]  No we don't ban them, they're allowed to have their horrible, evil, anti-American
[00:15:47.725 --> 00:15:48.725]  views.
[00:15:48.725 --> 00:15:51.365]  But they're not allowed to commit the crimes they commit against the public.
[00:15:51.365 --> 00:15:53.525]  We'll talk about all that when we come back, stay with us.
[00:15:59.845 --> 00:16:02.525]  I didn't realize this was back this week, thought it was next week, I come in this
[00:16:02.565 --> 00:16:06.645]  thing, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[00:16:06.645 --> 00:16:08.765]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:16:08.765 --> 00:16:12.605]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:16:12.605 --> 00:16:14.525]  Overhead shot please.
[00:16:14.525 --> 00:16:18.765]  Look how full this bottle is.
[00:16:18.765 --> 00:16:21.765]  Right to the top folks.
[00:16:21.765 --> 00:16:26.445]  Right to the top with these 95% cuminoid.
[00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:31.625]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:34.385]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:16:34.385 --> 00:16:38.465]  This is 95%.
[00:16:38.465 --> 00:16:43.105]  Super constant, so like taking one pill, it's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.105]  It's that powerful.
[00:16:44.105 --> 00:16:45.105]  Or more.
[00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:49.465]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.

[00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:04.345]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5G
[00:19:04.345 --> 00:19:06.185]  or the GMO crops.
[00:19:06.185 --> 00:19:11.025]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:12.545]  industry to use.
[00:19:12.545 --> 00:19:15.905]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:19.545]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[00:19:19.545 --> 00:19:25.145]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[00:19:25.145 --> 00:19:26.264]  Look it up.
[00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:27.505]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[00:20:01.425 --> 00:20:05.865]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[00:20:05.865 --> 00:20:07.345]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:37.860]  Well, we were faithful and truthful yet again, as you know, they're trying to roll out the
[00:20:37.939 --> 00:20:42.740]  lockdowns. Next segment, we have the videos from the press secretary. It's all being admitted now
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.899]  in a bunch of articles and saying time for the COVID protocols yet again.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.820]  As soon as you heard the White House tonight last week, you knew it was official.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.740]  That's their oxymoronic doublespeak
[00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:02.659]  that they continue to engage in over and over again. But let me
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:10.340]  give listeners an update on the state of info wars right now, because a lot of you want to know and
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.860]  I get a lot of questions about it on the street. The next segment, I'll get into all the news,
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.580]  and boy, is it important. And boy, are we ahead of this thing, and I'm so proud of everybody.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.100]  I'm really very optimistic right now, though we're in very dark times.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.379]  As you know, unless you've been hiding under a rock, we've been talking about the deep state,
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.659]  what they've done to Trump, they've done to us. Obviously, thank God to a lesser extent.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.460]  They have filed hundreds of lawsuits against Trump. They have indicted him
[00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:42.580]  four different times, twice federally, twice the state level. The word is war
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.860]  indictments are coming. Just this year, he spent $70 million on lawyers.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.340]  He spent about $50 million the year before that, about $40 million the year before that.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.460]  And under law, he's allowed to use campaign funds to do that,
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:00.100]  and they're completely mad and trying to somehow strip that so he can't defend himself,
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:07.940]  so they can railroad him even further. It's the same thing with us. They filed lawsuits,
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.899]  ran PR firms, put out things in the news, never said or did, had two judges in Connecticut
[00:22:12.899 --> 00:22:18.260]  and Texas default us and say that we were guilty, that a jury would just be shown evidence
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.899]  that we were guilty, we cannot put on a defense. People ask why my lawyers didn't do a good
[00:22:22.899 --> 00:22:26.419]  job. They weren't allowed to do it. They were given a few topics they could cover,
[00:22:26.419 --> 00:22:29.379]  and that was it to have the illusion of a trial, but I was already guilty.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.419]  They just did this two days ago to Giuliani. Oh, you're guilty, the judge says,
[00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:38.740]  now we decide how much money you pay. We're talking about Georgia and all the stuff we
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.500]  saw there on video. You're like, but we see it on video. They don't care. They have to
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.659]  find you guilty because Giuliani has all that evidence. He'd be able to put that on in a
[00:22:46.659 --> 00:22:51.220]  real defamation trial, not once you're defaulted, then you don't get to put evidence on.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:58.260]  The judge can put on whatever they want to a jury, okay? And I told everybody this is the plan,
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.100]  but they control key state courts and some federal courts. DC is obviously the worst
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.580]  for federal, and that's why they've indicted him there with January 6th, President Trump.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:14.899]  So with us, we have the official biggest Democratic Party law firm, you can look it up,
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.659]  that is running the adversarial operations against us with the other law firms in federal
[00:23:20.659 --> 00:23:24.419]  court in Houston. And they've said on the courthouse steps and in court,
[00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:29.699]  we don't want Jones on air, we want him shut down. Well, the law and something that
[00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:33.300]  went through under Trump was an expansion of bankruptcy to help the people, because we
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.179]  don't have debt or presence in this country. That's one of the reasons the nation was founded.
[00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:47.150]  Someone can only pay what they've got and you can't then say, no, you owe billions when you don't even have millions.
[00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:55.150]  And then for five years out as a statute, in some cases seven, anything extra you have is paid to them.
[00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.150]  Well, okay, fine, we stay on air, whatever. They don't want that, they've said they don't want that.
[00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:07.150]  They've used the process to harass us and torture us and do all this and it just makes me get up that much stronger every morning and fight back harder and do more shows and expand and that's just how I am.
[00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.150]  That's why he's attacking me and coming after me. I don't just roll over and piss all over myself.
[00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:19.150]  But I cannot stay in this fight without you. So here's the prognosis. I would give us a B plus right now thanks to you.
[00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:29.150]  You, the listeners, are the key to everything. 90% of it's you. My resistance, my will, and the crew supporting me and everything and my family, that's the other 10%.
[00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:35.150]  But without you, we're done. So I'm in your hands. That's why I humbly respect you. I don't ask you to thank me, I ask you to support me.
[00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:41.150]  So they told the federal judge early on when the bankruptcy started a year ago that I have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:47.150]  Now the judge now knows that's not true and he's going to probably change it soon. And he signaled that in court just last week.
[00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:57.150]  I literally had nothing. I'm actually upside down. I have like a million dollars in legal bills of the last year that I can't pay.
[00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:03.150]  That sounds like a lot. One law firm, the Democratic party law firm, has to follow the court, what they spend a month.
[00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:13.150]  They spend 1.2 million on average a month. They're deposing hundreds of people. Obviously, we haven't proven it's them, but they've got PIs, infiltrator groups.
[00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:22.150]  It's unbelievable. It's a James Bond movie. And we're just like, it's like they're investigating Barney Fife and Sheriff Mayberry.
[00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:30.150]  And we're like, okay, well, good luck with that. Because we don't roll like you folks. We're pretty simple folks.
[00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:37.150]  This weekend, I'll be in the pool with my wife and my daughter and the other older kids will come visit and I'll barbecue some steaks.
[00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:48.150]  And that's about as racy as we get. But that said, I've accrued over a million dollars in legal bills.
[00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:59.150]  And the lawyers have been very nice to have been paid for almost a year because the judge said, I have to pay 50 percent of the legal bills because the judge bought up front.
[00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:06.150]  Well, it must be true. They're in court saying he has 400 million dollars. You saw him say it on TV in the Texas trial. He has 400 mil.
[00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:13.150]  I had like two million dollars in the back then. Nothing now. Negative. I mean, I have money there, but it's held for them and there's not even enough.
[00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:25.150]  So I don't even care about the money. I'm not going to give up. But the issue is when you hear in the news, oh, they're asking for a budget of 1.5 million a year for Jones's salary.
[00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:31.150]  That won't even pay my legal bills with a third Sandy Hook show trial with the same Texas judge coming up set for October.
[00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:36.150]  Yeah, it's only a month and a half away or less. They're probably going to move it.
[00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:45.150]  And. At the same time, I have this big bill, so free speech is in the black a little bit. They're able to pay their bills.
[00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:55.150]  I can't pay these bills. And so. Literally, I'm in your hands. We need to raise a million dollars.
[00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:04.150]  And that sounds like a lot, folks. This is a war against the globalists. You want people to fight? Trump just spent almost 70 million this year.
[00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:10.150]  You understand how expensive it is just to comply with the discovery and what the courts do. And I'm not going to get into all the stuff.
[00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:17.150]  They got a bunch of other lawsuits, but it doesn't matter. It all got tied up in the bankruptcy. So that's really a blessing in a way.
[00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:29.150]  And so I need funds. I need money. To get my lawyers paid and to continue the appeals of these show trials and to continue the bankruptcy.
[00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:34.150]  And we're doing pretty good for spending a little over one hundred thousand dollars a month.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:44.340]  To battle these people, I think it's like about a hundred and thirty thousand they were saying is the average.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:49.340]  So free speech pays half of that. I spent all the money I had fighting the last few years. I don't have any money.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:57.340]  And I can't do it. So it's very simple. You want me out of the game? You want this show to shut down?
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:03.340]  I'll still be able to go to a show with Crowder and I got a bunch of other offers but it'll hurt the infrastructure, the crew, this historic operation.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:11.340]  We're having a bigger effect here. Alex Jones was right. It's everywhere. We are exploding. People are waking up. We need to stay in the game.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.340]  Because this isn't like some mindless football game or hockey game that doesn't really matter.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:21.340]  This is for the future of the country and the world. The globalists see us as a prize that they want to try to shut down.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:27.340]  So please go now. And I want to thank all of you that have donated in the past because this isn't for free speech systems.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:36.340]  This is for my bills. This is for my accountants and the CPAs and the audits and all of it, okay?
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:44.340]  And I got audited by the IRS for a year. They said, well, we never really see this but you overpaid your taxes in the last five years, $4,200,000.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:50.340]  Here's 4.2 mil. That's held by the court as well. So I can't use that. We've got to figure out what's happening there.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:57.340]  So it's all held up. It's all locked up. It's all there. I'm out of money. I need you to go to defendjones.com.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:26.340]  We've got a larger neurological system. You name it. I mean, it's just so amazing. God gave it to us.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:31.340]  And it's the strongest curcuminoid out there. Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:36.340]  Most brands are 5% curcumin. And that still does a great thing for you.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:43.340]  This is the strongest anybody makes. 95% curcuminoid. I am so glad this is back.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:48.340]  I have been out of this myself for months. We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.

[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:03.600]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.240]  coffee has not been available. And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.220]  and the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies that wanted to work
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:19.040]  with us. But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national

[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.520]  because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.760]  I turned down so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.960]  But when the folks at Minute Man came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees,
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.920]  I was blown away. We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.760]  available to you right now. This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.

[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:37.320]  at Infowarsstore.com exclusively. Escape the prison planet light roast. Tastes great.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.240]  It's the strong one. Really strong. But these are all close second and thirds.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:46.520]  Medium roast wig of America. That's what my go-to dark roast, tip of the spear,

[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:04.920]  We finally have our original best selling colloidal silver back in stock
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.760]  with the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:15.080]  We could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.

[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:07.660]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:26.699]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:33.179]  Traveling patriots worldwide.
[00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:35.459]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:35.459 --> 00:33:36.459]  Let me try to cover the update on InfoWars.
[00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:37.459]  It's a few minutes more and I'll get into all the news.
[00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:38.459]  I know that's why you're tuned in, but you also don't know what's happening.
[00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:48.500]  So I want to tell you, and back to this IRS thing.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.740]  We have accountants and all this stuff, and the way this company was set up, whatever
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:58.379]  reason for five years, the CPA company, when we would pay for flights, or trips, or crew,
[00:33:58.379 --> 00:34:03.699]  or things, it somehow got listed, this is just part of it, as profit to me.
[00:34:03.699 --> 00:34:08.400]  And so I was always wondering, how am I paying more taxes than I keep?
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.860]  And so we got audited, very aggressive, went on for a year, I mean the IRS was here
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.819]  digging through everything, and by the grace of God, you want to say agencies are corrupt,
[00:34:17.819 --> 00:34:23.140]  we know that Obama sicked the IRS on conservatives, hundreds of thousands of them, it was terrible.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:27.860]  They actually came back and went, well this is pretty rare, but we owe you 4.2 million
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.860]  dollars.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:30.779]  You're like, well then your problems are solved.
[00:34:30.779 --> 00:34:34.520]  No, it's in the bankruptcy, plus I haven't paid taxes in over a year.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.940]  So all that's got to go on, that's locked up with the judge, that's not money we
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.940]  can get.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.799]  I'm just telling you what's going on.
[00:34:41.799 --> 00:34:44.779]  But that shows that it's the opposite.
[00:34:44.779 --> 00:34:52.140]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I am like the sheriff of Mayberry, if he was more of a
[00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:57.980]  drinker and a womanizer, and I'm married, I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not perfect.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.660]  And I've gotten good about both those issues, but the point is, is that I'm not
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.900]  up here on some high horse, but when it comes to my life, I am like the sheriff
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]  of Mayberry.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:14.299]  I am a straight shooter, nice guy, just like most of you out there, none of us are perfect.
[00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:19.660]  And to have them project onto me like they projected onto white people, and I'm going
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.420]  to get to that coming up next hour, all over the news is you've seen white people
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:27.020]  are inherently bad, and they say that about you, and you're just like, that's
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.020]  not true.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.020]  Or they say I'm this evil mastermind, and I've done all these things, and then
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.180]  they just kept hoping they'd find something corrupt.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.100]  They kept hoping they'd get me with the IRS.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.940]  They kept hoping, and it's the opposite.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.940]  It's the absolute opposite.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.700]  And I'm not saying, again, I'm perfect.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.460]  That's why I tell you issues I've had.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:52.259]  I have a temper, and I like to drink, and I like to fight, and luckily I've not gotten
[00:35:52.259 --> 00:35:56.259]  into that in decades, and it just comes down to that.
[00:35:56.259 --> 00:35:57.259]  But I'm a good person.
[00:35:57.259 --> 00:35:58.980]  I love God overall.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.180]  And I'm feeling really good about all this, because they have shot their wad.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.900]  And I'm going to explain this again.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:10.299]  1.2 million a month.
[00:36:10.299 --> 00:36:12.620]  One of the five law firms attacking us.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.299]  I'm not going to even give them attention and go to the filings if you want to read
[00:36:16.299 --> 00:36:17.299]  their name.
[00:36:17.299 --> 00:36:19.340]  You're like, whoa, that's the Democratic party's main law firm, yeah.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:24.140]  The Democratic party, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Justice Department, you've seen
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.900]  it in the news, the Justice Department investigates Jones's bankruptcy.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.900]  Jones has hundreds of millions.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.779]  He's going to prison.
[00:36:30.779 --> 00:36:33.779]  Completely made up.
[00:36:33.779 --> 00:36:34.779]  Completely.
[00:36:34.779 --> 00:36:38.980]  So when you see a lot about Trump, if you've not experienced this level, most of you haven't,
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.020]  you don't understand the level of lying, folks.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.220]  Remember, they had New York Times articles, there's thousands of lies that said that
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.660]  there was a fish tank with a goldfish, and it was an employee's, and I said, you haven't
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.740]  worked hard enough, and I grabbed the goldfish and I ate it.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.580]  There's never been a fish here on my children.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.580]  I have fish.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.580]  I love fish.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.180]  I have fish, a saltwater tank at my house that I've had for 10 years.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.299]  I have some 10-year-old fish that I love that I feed once a week.
[00:37:02.819 --> 00:37:06.060]  When you're supposed to feed them once a week, or they get sick.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.940]  And the point is, is that I love my fish.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:14.140]  But they come up with this stuff that just sounds so ridiculous, oh, they wouldn't lie
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.420]  and say, that's in Wolf of Wall Street.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:23.420]  So that's the level of their deception, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.340]  And that's what they do.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.960]  And that's who they are.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.620]  And they think they've got this country, and I think they can bully us all, but they
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:34.540]  can't bully you into submission if you don't decide to submit, and they can't bully me
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.540]  into submission.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:39.299]  So it sounds like a big number, but Trump's in the hundreds of millions now in the last
[00:37:39.299 --> 00:37:41.819]  few years battling these people.
[00:37:41.819 --> 00:37:45.500]  And anytime I feel sorry for myself, I think about that New York case where the woman
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.740]  has no witnesses or anything from decades ago.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:55.020]  He says she grabbed her in a dressing room, and the jury says, well, he didn't rape her,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:00.500]  but we're finding him guilty of defamation, $5 million, because he said he was innocent.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.180]  Well, aren't you allowed to say you're innocent?
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.180]  Which he is, obviously.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:08.740]  So that's where we are, and I'm not going to give up, but I want to explain this
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.740]  to you.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.880]  It's like, you own a car.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:15.120]  This broadcast is your car, the show you've supported, it's yours.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.140]  You supported it, you spread the word, you prayed for it, it's your car.
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:27.259]  And if you don't put oil in the engine, and I got smoke coming out the tailpipe, it's
[00:38:27.259 --> 00:38:29.759]  going to seize up and blow up.
[00:38:29.759 --> 00:38:32.980]  So it's a real simple equation.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:38.420]  You decide now to go to Infowarsstore.com, and that supports free speech, and that's
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.420]  great.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.259]  But free speech is stabilized and doing okay right now.
[00:38:41.259 --> 00:38:43.580]  Not great, but okay.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.420]  But you decide to go to DefendJones.com, and it takes you to give Cengo and those
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:54.540]  great folks over there, you make a $10, $100, $1000, whatever you can donation, and then
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:03.060]  I can pay my legal team and Mike and I've got some great people now that have not
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.060]  been paid in almost a year.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.480]  And they're still cool with it.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.700]  They still believe they're going to get through the bankruptcy and that they're going
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.600]  to get the contract for me done so I can get paid.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.660]  You understand, I'm paid 40% of my salary, I agreed to a year ago on the bankruptcy.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:25.640]  They didn't have the money, $1.5 million, that would only pay my legal bills.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.640]  No money.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.160]  I spent everything I had already.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:36.480]  And they're just nicely waiting and hoping the judge approves that.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.160]  And I'm like, we don't want to be negative in the tank.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.660]  We're not talking about empty, we're like way below empty.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.620]  We need the funds and we need to be confident about this to be able to go forward because
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.380]  free speech is bankruptcy that I predict is going to go through.
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.060]  The judges signal that we've been totally above board.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.779]  The other side's been caught lying over and over again.
[00:39:56.779 --> 00:39:57.779]  They keep doing it.
[00:39:57.779 --> 00:39:59.299]  They've been admonished over and over again.
[00:39:59.299 --> 00:40:04.620]  Looks like we finally got a judge that's not a crook, okay?
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.580]  Judge Lopez.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.460]  So I am literally in his hands and I am in your hands.
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.380]  And I trust in God.
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.100]  If Lopez says no, you're shut down.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.100]  That's it.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.100]  I'd still be on air somewhere else.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.480]  It'll hurt a lot of people.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480]  We don't want them to win.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.120]  But I'm already comfortable with that.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:28.420]  I'm just telling you, if you don't go to DefendJones.com, it is literally you, not
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.960]  the globalist, not the left, not the pedophile New World Order, not George Soros that
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.299]  will pull our plug.
[00:40:37.299 --> 00:40:40.060]  It will be you.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.500]  And look, I've been there when the decision is made to pull the plug on family and we
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.000]  follow their directives and they say they're brain dead and you love them and you're
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]  there and they die.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.140]  I've been there five, six times at least when loved ones die.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.140]  But I'm not in a coma.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.700]  I've still got fight here and I would really like to be kept in the game.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.700]  So I'm not guilting you.
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.859]  I respect you and appreciate you.
[00:40:58.859 --> 00:41:01.060]  I'm just saying I think it's a no brainer.
[00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:07.110]  To keep him full of wars in the game.
[00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:11.210]  I think it's a no brainer to not give them this victory.
[00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.530]  Needs hundreds of millions and he needs it.
[00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:17.030]  I need a million dollars.
[00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:20.550]  So you want us to take on the big dogs, you want us to fight the new world order, well
[00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:21.550]  we're doing it.
[00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.550]  Okay?
[00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.550]  And you can see the scars.
[00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.190]  I had a couple people in the hiking bike show yesterday when I was shooting that asked
[00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:30.030]  me if I knew anything or changed my mind deal.
[00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:32.270]  And they were like, why are you still alive?
[00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:33.270]  Are you kidding?
[00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:34.270]  There's not just evil in the world.
[00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.390]  And I don't know why I'm still alive other than God.
[00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.190]  Do they need to kill me to prove I'm for real?
[00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.710]  I mean, we devastate the enemy daily.
[00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:45.990]  I've been doing this 29 years.
[00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.470]  So this is your broadcast.
[00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:49.270]  This is your vehicle.
[00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.790]  And if you choose to keep driving it around and don't put the oil in the tank, and I'm
[00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.790]  not blaming you.
[00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.550]  I'm telling you, hey, you might not notice this black smoke coming out of the back.
[00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.390]  And that's your choice.
[00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:07.510]  But I cannot continue on and I cannot do this broadcast if we don't raise in the next month
[00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.510]  a million dollars.
[00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:09.510]  And that should not be that much.
[00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:11.430]  I mean, we reach millions of people.
[00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:18.190]  And if just 10,000 of you go give a small donation and don't wait and go to defendjones.com
[00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:22.230]  and defend yourselves against these tyrants, because if your lead soldiers are battling
[00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:26.150]  the enemy and having a huge victory, but you know, we get shot and we need medical help.
[00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.390]  I mean, I've been politically shot up.
[00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.510]  I'm just like, hey, my legs are blown off, put a robotic leg on there.
[00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.830]  I'm ready to go back in.
[00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.870]  But if you don't give me the robot leg, folks, I can't do it.
[00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:36.870]  Okay.
[00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:40.190]  It's like having a pit bull that wins a bunch of fights, but it's eyeballs hanging out.
[00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:48.270]  If you don't show it back in and feed at dinner, it's not going to be back in the pit, in the arena for you the next day.
[00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:53.710]  So it's up to you, your decision, defendjones.com.
[00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.550]  I know we're getting a lot of new radio affiliates.
[00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.390]  I know we're getting a lot of support.
[00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.510]  I know that a lot of blessings are happening.
[00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.750]  The show's having mega massive effects.
[00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:07.110]  I've got some very exciting announcements coming up in October that are just amazing.
[00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:11.470]  And all I can say is I'm very blessed, but I don't want to say I'm a prideful man,
[00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.030]  but I also am a self-sufficient person generally.
[00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:19.910]  I was never even in debt, bought my first car with cash that I saved, working jobs.
[00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:24.990]  They couldn't believe when they came in here and audited this that there was no debt and that there was no hanky-panky or anything else.
[00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.990]  And we're here.
[00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.390]  And so it's up to you.
[00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:38.230]  Infowars, store.com supports free speech systems, you get great products there, and you should support there.
[00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.750]  Because if you support me too much and not that, then it's out of balance.
[00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.430]  But what's out of balance is I've been a pretty good steward.
[00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.550]  I knew all this was coming.
[00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.470]  This was going down five years ago.
[00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:59.710]  And I learned about a house in Westlake that a banker had built, but he wasn't finishing.
[00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.190]  And he was selling it, trying to get $4 million for it.
[00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:06.230]  And I had $3 million in the bank as my emergency backup, my personal backup.
[00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.270]  I went and spent all of it to get that house.
[00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:14.150]  I built, finished the house, sold it for over $7 million last year.
[00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:23.630]  I took all that money and I dumped it in last year to keep us on air.
[00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:33.870]  I took all the Bitcoin money, other than I think like 100 and something thousand for bonuses to crew, but that's still in the company.
[00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:34.990]  And I put it all in.
[00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:40.070]  And the other side, boy, they said, we're auditing you and we got you in court and you're going to jail.
[00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:42.070]  You perjured yourself in Connecticut.
[00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:43.310]  We know you kept that money.
[00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:48.790]  And they got egg all to their face when it's all went into this operation, because I don't give a damn about money.
[00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.750]  I don't worship it.
[00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:56.030]  But money is fuel to me or like ammunition in the info war.
[00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:59.870]  And so it's very, very simple.
[00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.310]  You're going to have to spend time and energy and money to fight the globalist.
[00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.310]  You're going to have to boycott globalist companies.
[00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.510]  You're going to have to boycott Patriot companies.
[00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:11.950]  And you're going to have to belly up because I've done the math on Trump.
[00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:16.910]  Oh, he raised seven million when he got indicted in Georgia.
[00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:21.670]  He is only raised half the money Joe Biden has.
[00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.750]  And of course, Biden's got all the billionaires giving money.
[00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:26.510]  Trump has an average donation of fifty two dollars.
[00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:33.990]  I'm not trying to lobby for Trump here, but I'm going to tell you right now, they try to sell these big numbers like, oh, Trump's been 67 million this year on lawyers.
[00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.710]  He doesn't need your money.
[00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.670]  Trump is beat to hell.
[00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.870]  He's tough. He comes off as strong.
[00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.270]  He's stalwart. He is strong.
[00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.910]  But let me tell you, he needs your support too.
[00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.390]  But I need it right now.
[00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:48.830]  Trump needs hundreds of millions.
[00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.470]  I need a million dollars to fight these people.
[00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:56.150]  And I cannot do it without you.
[00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.950]  And you see the game changing and you see what's happening.
[00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.070]  And again, I'm not bragging. It's the grace of God.
[00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:09.630]  I am so blessed. I can't tell you off record, a lot of on record, how much we've influenced everybody.
[00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:12.070]  Whether it is Tulsi Gabbards, R.F.K.
[00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:20.190]  Junior or Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson or Vivek Ramaswamy claims it or now, you know, Oliver Anthony saying nice stuff.
[00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:29.830]  The point is, is that this show, your support, our guests, what we've done has changed the world and the enemy knows it.
[00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.270]  Let that sink in.
[00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:37.190]  That's why they're so after us, because they know we're the ones like them.
[00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:40.670]  We're the ones beat the living political hell out of these people.
[00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:44.190]  They attacked us first, but they smell victory.
[00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:50.150]  The enemy smells it here because of what we've built, what we've done together.
[00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:52.590]  And so I want to thank God for putting me in this position.
[00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:56.430]  And I'm thankful for the persecution and thankful for everything that's happened.
[00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.990]  It's been bad for my family and I'm sad for them.
[00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:01.270]  But I have been very honored to be here.
[00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.710]  And I just ask you to keep me in the game.
[00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:10.670]  I humbly ask you on my knees to spread the word like you've never done before, to pray with the broadcast like you've never done before.
[00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:18.430]  And to go to Infowarsstore.com and to get body salt and Timuric formula and to get super fuel vitality and to get the great fluoride free essential oil toothpaste.
[00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.270]  All three are amazing.
[00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:23.470]  I personally like the Timuric the best.
[00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:29.070]  They're all there at Infowarsstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:31.270]  But I need the support.
[00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:32.910]  I'm out of ammo.
[00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:37.510]  I'm here at the Alamo and man, I don't have any other ammo here.
[00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.270]  I need your support, defendjones.com.
[00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:46.950]  And it goes to pay the lawyers and professional fees because I don't have the money.
[00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:51.750]  And I got to say, I went through some rocky times, had some good lawyers, some bad lawyers.
[00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.270]  Looked like my lawyers were terrible, but it was really because the system was rigged.
[00:47:54.270 --> 00:48:00.230]  But I got first rate people that know what's going on right now.
[00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.750]  And it's.
[00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:04.710]  Up to you.
[00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:09.150]  It's everything is up to you.
[00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.350]  And that's all I can say now, I'm going to stop there.
[00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:16.470]  But I just wanted to give you an update on what's going on.
[00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.910]  And what's happening and.
[00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:21.870]  If I had to show you a graph.
[00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:25.070]  In my mind, I would say.
[00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:28.390]  But a full shot, please.
[00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:35.030]  I would say their persecution has supercharged us in the mythical status here.
[00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:39.630]  But their attacks have almost shut us down.
[00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:47.970]  All I need is more support and the awakening is exponential and.
[00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:52.750]  Just wait and see in a couple of months, we've really done a number on them together.
[00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:55.070]  Now they're going to strike back.
[00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.070]  And I'm not stupid.
[00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:57.990]  They could kill me or something along those lines.
[00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:59.310]  So we're in that season.
[00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.870]  I'll never commit suicide when I make that clear.
[00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.430]  But it's it's getting serious.
[00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.630]  I'm not going to get into everything people don't want me to.
[00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:14.310]  But they're harassing crew.
[00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:17.670]  Well Owen didn't tell me not to talk about what's been happening to him.
[00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.510]  They pull Owen over every day when he leaves work.
[00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:23.310]  And almost every morning.
[00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:24.310]  And harass him.
[00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.310]  He's in a database.
[00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:26.310]  They're harassed.
[00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:27.810]  A little bit stunned out of him.
[00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:29.350]  And folks, that's just part of the course.
[00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:30.350]  And we're not victims here.
[00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:31.350]  We're not.
[00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:34.030]  Oh, I'm just telling you, they're on our ass.
[00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.029]  But that's OK.
[00:49:35.029 --> 00:49:36.029]  We're real Americans.
[00:49:36.029 --> 00:49:38.430]  We're not cowards like they are.
[00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.350]  And we're not backing down.
[00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:41.550]  But I'm explaining again.
[00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.550]  I don't back down.
[00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.550]  I don't run.
[00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.050]  I don't know how to.
[00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.050]  It's terrible.
[00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.050]  Somebody starts a fight with me.
[00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:49.390]  I just cannot back down.
[00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.110]  I just want to.
[00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.110]  It didn't matter.
[00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.110]  They're six foot eight.
[00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.110]  And then I just.
[00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.630]  In fact, the bigger and meaner they are, the more I want to fight them.
[00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:57.870]  It's like this thing.
[00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.370]  I just can't do it.
[00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.550]  But I can give out, folks.
[00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:08.310]  And that's all I'm telling you is, please keep me in the fight.
[00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.790]  Please realize how serious this is.
[00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:13.630]  Understand how horrible this is.
[00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:16.390]  But listen, it's just going to get worse if we bow to them.
[00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:21.029]  These are the most evil people you can imagine, and they just plan to do more and more horrible
[00:50:21.029 --> 00:50:22.670]  things to everybody.
[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:27.070]  And so there's got to be some point where we just say to them, I don't know how all
[00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:28.070]  this is going to end.
[00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.670]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:38.470]  But I can't fight without you.
[00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.029]  Defend Jones dot com.
[00:50:41.029 --> 00:50:43.310]  Defend Jones dot com.
[00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:44.310]  Defend Jones dot com.
[00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:45.310]  All right.
[00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:46.310]  I didn't mean to spend 20 minutes on that.
[00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.550]  I'm done talking about it.
[00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:49.550]  I get so prepared.
[00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.250]  I'm almost exhausted even before I get on the air.
[00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:57.090]  I mean, if you think I'd be up here tooting my horn, oh, look, White House press secretary
[00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:01.210]  said they're bringing back COVID testing and shots and masks and quote, everything's
[00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.210]  coming back.
[00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.830]  I'll play the video coming up.
[00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:08.950]  And I and I've just got more of them saying we're to cut all the trees down, block the
[00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:17.990]  sun out and mad scientists running around all insane, saying they own our bodies.
[00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:21.790]  And then meanwhile, they got hundreds of thousands of legal aliens in New York, give them ten
[00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:25.270]  thousand dollars a month, they don't have to take the shots, they're telling the citizens
[00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.270]  they do.
[00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:31.870]  When you got this, New York police will use drones to monitor backyard parties this
[00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:32.870]  weekend.
[00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:33.870]  AP.
[00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.590]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.270]  People will never stop producing spike protein study finds.
[00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:44.470]  Yeah, they colonize you with a damn prion that's very similar to what causes spongiform
[00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:45.470]  encephalopathy.
[00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:50.630]  And I just look at the average person serving the system and I'm like, they're injecting
[00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:54.510]  you with mad cow prions?
[00:51:54.510 --> 00:52:02.830]  You know, I wish that rumor that it was snake venom was right, because you can at
[00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.670]  least detox off snake venom.
[00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:09.750]  Folks, it's very hard to get rid of protein prion crystals.
[00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:10.750]  You don't know about it.
[00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:11.750]  You better learn.
[00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:13.750]  We'll cover all that.
[00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:18.510]  Meanwhile, I told you the press secretary just did stuff that was next level gaslighting.
[00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.070]  Laughable, except it's not.
[00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:24.470]  White House claims Biden reacted in record time to Maui fires.
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:33.279]  Parents find remains of teen son hugging dead dog in Maui home destroyed by wildfire.
[00:52:33.279 --> 00:52:41.580]  We were told that two weeks ago and now it's all confirmed.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:47.819]  Video pastor forcefully removed from school board meeting for reading a loud porn book.
[00:52:47.819 --> 00:52:53.620]  So hey, you silly thing.
[00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.779]  Child porn books are for kids, not for adults to look at or read in public.
[00:52:57.779 --> 00:53:03.540]  You get arrested for indecency as adults reading what you want taken out of the school.
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.220]  Oh, you're a book banner.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.220]  You're a book burner.
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:12.900]  No, I don't believe we should serve two year olds Jack Daniels for breakfast.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:15.980]  Doesn't mean I'm for prohibition.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.940]  Just like I'm not for the criminalization of marijuana doesn't mean you give it to
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.220]  five year olds.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:27.460]  And I am for the criminalization of graphic images of children having sex with adults
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:33.660]  telling children if your next door neighbor wants to have sex with you in the tool shed,
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.100]  that's one of the books they have in schools in Austin.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.100]  Go ahead.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:44.660]  It's fun priming children to not want to go out when they're 11 or 12 and ask
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:49.140]  a girl out to the movies with your parents and have some ice cream.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.720]  No, no, no, no.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.720]  You can become a new gender and be taken from your parents and put in a government
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.880]  home with a bunch of pedophiles.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:02.980]  It's beyond sick and it's us that let it happen.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:09.040]  But you resist at defendjones.com.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:19.779]  But it really is up to you and I'm done talking about it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:19.779 --> 00:54:24.580]  But they say you know a man by his friends and his enemies and I'm known by all you
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:30.420]  great people who are my friends and I'm known by my enemies and I know it's hard
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.339]  to believe how evil they are.
[00:54:32.339 --> 00:54:36.940]  Ted Gunnarsson told me 27 years ago about the new world order and how they traffic
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.140]  children in mass and sell their organs.
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:45.900]  I looked him up, he was credible, former FBI section chief over Southern California
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.900]  but I still just couldn't believe it.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:55.140]  Here's a place called Bohemian Grove where they worship a big statue and burn a kid
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.220]  in an effigy and we found dead kids in the area and I went and looked it up and
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:59.220]  it's all true.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.580]  Then I snuck in there and sure as hell he said on July 15th every year they do it
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.620]  and I got in there at night and on July 15th it happened.
[00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:14.730]  He broke down how they've taken over whole towns all over the country with Satan worshippers
[00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:24.250]  and now that's come out in the documents. He told me like in 1997, he goes, every July,
[00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:28.970]  on July 15th they do this ritual and they compromise people there and they do all this
[00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:32.090]  and later I talked to people that actually worked there and they said it was true so
[00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:38.690]  I sneak in on that day and it happens. Yeah, I think Ted Garner sounds a little bit crazy.
[00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:42.450]  He goes, you get in there and nobody else will get into but he knew that I'd snuck on
[00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:48.770]  military bases and done some other undercover stuff. He said, you need to get in there.
[00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:54.690]  Well we did and just like TV Guide used to tell you, oh, coming up tonight, John
[00:55:54.690 --> 00:56:03.970]  Wayne and the searchers, 8pm, you'd sit down with your popcorn and your Coca Cola, put your
[00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:13.370]  feet up and John Wayne comes on. Boy, I snuck in there July 15th and the sun went down
[00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:17.770]  and they came out in their hoods and robes and they worshipped the devil. Just like
[00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:25.210]  I turned the TV on for, well, it's the premiere of the NFL, Monday Night Football, 7pm.
[00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:55.540]  I know it sounds crazy because it is. These people are nuts and they believe they're the power structure and they're a bunch of predators and they believe they're immune to bully and attack and hurt us and poison us and take over our bodies and our children. But humanity's waking up. So I'm going to get focused, I'm going to get mean, I'm going to get serious. And when we come back...
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:07.620]  I'm going to get locked down 2.0s. They're officially trying to roll them out. Then James Woods knocks it out of the park. Then all the attacks on free speech. The ADL trending number one. Ban the ADL.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:16.640]  And so much more today. But even if you can't make a donation at defendjones.com, I totally understand.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.640]  But it's the middle class and wealthy folks that sit on the fence are the ones that really shouldn't get off the fence.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:26.640]  Trump's getting almost all his donations from hard working middle class and working class folks.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:32.640]  It should be people that got something to really lose financially should be fighting the global storm.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.640]  But regardless, spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:40.640]  For everybody you know, however you're listening, AMF, MTV, cable or mfowars.com, board slash show or band.video.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.640]  Tell them the forbidden show the bad guys hate is on. Pass it on. We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:52.839]  I didn't realize this was back this week. Thought it was next week. I come in this morning.
[00:57:52.839 --> 00:57:58.520]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll. Body's ultimate turmeric formula. And the
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:06.160]  first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys. Overhead shot, please. Look how full
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:17.480]  this model is. Right to the top, folks. Right to the top with these 95% humanoids. Again,
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:24.080]  most turmeric formulas are 5%. Some are maybe 10. The other strongest brands are 75%. This
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:32.799]  is 95%. Super constant. So like taking one pills, like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:58:32.799 --> 00:58:40.439]  It's that powerful or more. So they're available at info war store.com. Body's ultimate turmeric

[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.799]  you are the resistance.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:31.439]  All right, I'm going to get into the new developments where they're admitting attempts
[01:00:31.439 --> 01:00:36.560]  to bring back the COVID tyranny. We're totally vindicated two weeks later. I'm going to
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.799]  not spend much time on that. I want to tie it into James Woods though. It's really
[01:00:39.799 --> 01:00:43.200]  important of some other key clips next segment, but in this short segment, let's
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.040]  get to Ramaswami who everything he says is pure gold. It's hurting the globalist.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.140]  They're all after him. They're demonizing him everywhere. And I see a lot of right
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.779]  wingers and I've even kind of joined in a little bit saying, Oh, he can't trust
[01:00:55.779 --> 01:00:59.580]  him. He's mad. We gotta be ready to win and have defectors come over. But here he
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.700]  is pledging to release the Epstein list that they're really suppressing. Here it
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:09.580]  is. Anyway, um, my question is Epstein list, please, for our sanity sake, make
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:14.460]  that list public. I'm tired of being called a conspiracy theorist. Well, I think
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.379]  what we have a lot of in this country are a lot of conspiracy realists. Uh, and
[01:01:18.379 --> 01:01:22.700]  so it's not one of them just because everything that you sort of suspect
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.979]  oftentimes comes true, but I don't be tied to the facts, not to the
[01:01:25.979 --> 01:01:29.740]  narratives. So we will publish the Jeffrey Epstein client list, no doubt
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.939]  about it, no doubt about it. And I think that that's part of a broader
[01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:37.819]  pattern of just restoring and rebuilding trust in this country. But
[01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.979]  if I see how this is, there's some Republicans on there that need
[01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:43.819]  protection. Nope. I'm thinking about the people who we spent millions of
[01:01:43.819 --> 01:01:50.379]  dollars of congressional hush money, tax payer money used to settle sexual
[01:01:50.379 --> 01:01:55.740]  assault allegations for members of Congress. It's a secret list. Why are
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.500]  monies being spent to do it? Let's just see it. Roll the log over.
[01:02:00.979 --> 01:02:06.339]  Let's see what calls out. That's the first step to actually restoring
[01:02:06.339 --> 01:02:10.779]  trust in this country. Anytime a government official has pressured
[01:02:10.779 --> 01:02:14.620]  private actors to do through the back door, what government couldn't do
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.939]  through the front door, at least publish it. We've got to see it.
[01:02:19.899 --> 01:02:23.899]  Sunlight is the best disinfectant. And I trust the people of this
[01:02:23.899 --> 01:02:26.859]  country to say it's not just when it is easy, but when it's hard
[01:02:26.859 --> 01:02:32.299]  that we will confront the truth. That's right. So policy wise, I see
[01:02:32.299 --> 01:02:34.859]  no fault with the guy. He's great. I know he was more relentless
[01:02:34.859 --> 01:02:38.859]  before. We got to not totally trust him, trust and verify, but I
[01:02:38.859 --> 01:02:42.140]  really think we should get off his back because some Republicans
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.419]  seems a threat to Trump. He's not. He's a supporter of Trump.
[01:02:45.419 --> 01:02:48.060]  That's my opinion. We can take calls. You can disagree if you want.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.859]  But here's another video. We just had one two days ago.
[01:02:50.859 --> 01:02:57.419]  This is in Florida. Pastor forcibly removed for reading what's being
[01:02:57.419 --> 01:03:01.020]  given to children. Here it is. Now on the topic of these
[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.060]  pornographic books that you keep calling these point of contacts on
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.500]  as it relates to whether they should be read or not.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.819]  13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher, currently in Storm Grove Middle
[01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:12.220]  School and Freshman Learning Center, page 265.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.259]  Continue with that. Yes, sir. No, sir. I asked you to stop.
[01:03:39.259 --> 01:03:43.979]  I asked you to stop. Sir, if you don't, sir, I'm asking you
[01:03:43.979 --> 01:03:45.100]  to stop. If you don't do it, we're going to have you
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.060]  removed. Thank you. Please. I've asked you to stop. Yes,
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:52.140]  sir. I've asked you to stop. Sir, I'm asking you to stop.
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:56.779]  Yes. When I stop, it's removed. And I've asked you to stop.
[01:03:56.779 --> 01:03:59.419]  So you're going to let us sexualize your children and
[01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:01.419]  you're not going to show the world what we give them.
[01:04:01.419 --> 01:04:04.779]  And by the way, that book's nothing. They've got one in
[01:04:04.779 --> 01:04:06.540]  that school district everywhere else. They put it in
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:10.060]  every school district. It's in Austin in the middle school
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.899]  that tells little kids and shows graphic cartoons
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.339]  of sex acts on children. That's what they're doing.
[01:04:22.379 --> 01:04:24.700]  So Breitbart's editor came out with a big article.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.460]  If Dems win in 2034, you lose your kids. Yeah, that's
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.339]  it. If they win, you lose your kids. They're coming
[01:04:31.339 --> 01:04:34.140]  for your children. We've got that coming up.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:35.580]  Hell, they're not coming. They're already here.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.899]  There's no limit to these people. And if you
[01:04:39.899 --> 01:04:42.379]  criticize it, the ADL's coming after you. We'll talk
[01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:46.700]  about the ADL. Big broadcast. Stay with us.
[01:04:47.339 --> 01:04:51.500]  Back in 60 seconds. InfoWars.com, man.video,
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.899]  newswars.com. Those are the coordinates of liberty.
[01:04:53.899 --> 01:04:57.259]  I suggest you spread them.
[01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:03.230]  Separately, we've got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:07.470]  really, really, really, really, really good news, because it's a great product you love
[01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:11.109]  and people want it and it funds our operation of 360 Wind.
[01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:15.910]  Bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, the strongest you're going to find anywhere, jam-packed,
[01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:21.069]  a big old giant bottle of stuff that destroys inflammation, that empowers your
[01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:26.149]  neurological system, you name it, I mean it's just so amazing, God gave it to us
[01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:28.350]  and it's the strongest you're humanoid out there.
[01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:31.790]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:36.470]  Most brands are 5% humanoid and that still does a great thing for you.
[01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:41.390]  This is the strongest anybody makes, 95% you're humanoid.
[01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:43.029]  I am so glad this is back.
[01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:45.870]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:48.750]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.350]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula, back in stock, 25% off,

[01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:16.169]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[01:06:16.169 --> 01:06:23.450]  so does he. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:40.970]  All right. All of this is interconnected. We're going to lay it all out right now.
[01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:52.169]  Are we facing lockdown 2.0? Really good article for the Brownstone Institute on
[01:06:52.169 --> 01:06:58.009]  zeroheads.com. And it's just the author going, I turn on the television. I turn on NPR on the radio.
[01:06:58.009 --> 01:07:03.009]  It's we've got to have masks. We've got to have contact tracing. We've got to have school closures.
[01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:07.049]  And then we've got football games canceled and high schools closed all over the country
[01:07:07.049 --> 01:07:14.169]  and masking going back everywhere. The Democrats control things, same things happening
[01:07:14.169 --> 01:07:21.729]  around the world. Right as they try to put in the UN treaty on quote health, where they take
[01:07:21.729 --> 01:07:26.930]  control of our bodies and censor us. And that's how we start getting into the ADL news. Look at
[01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:34.890]  this giant stack when we get to that coming up this hour. So. Here is the press secretary
[01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:41.330]  yesterday in between saying Biden did a great job responding to Hawaii or to Lahaina, Hawaii.
[01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:47.169]  Here is the press secretary saying the Biden administration will be encouraging all Americans
[01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:53.970]  to get their updated COVID vaccine, which is even a vaccine. Then she says, we have tools at our
[01:07:53.970 --> 01:08:00.370]  disposal, whether it's vaccines, whether it's home tests, whether it's mask or more. So it's on
[01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:03.810]  they're doing it. They just don't want us to respond and say, no, we don't want this.
[01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:08.209]  Like you're going to eat bugs. We're going to take your property and we're going to cut
[01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:11.970]  your energy off and take your car. I don't want that. Nobody wants to take your car.
[01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:15.649]  Nobody wants to make you eat bugs. Hey, we're going to ban your gas powered stoves and
[01:08:15.649 --> 01:08:20.130]  water heaters and generators and everything else. And your light bulbs. Well, we don't want that.
[01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:24.769]  Well, nobody's going to take your nobody's planning to take any of that next day.
[01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:30.370]  We're taking it all. So they never respond to you even in a real debate.
[01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:36.530]  They say, talk to the hand. So let's play clip 19 and 20 back to back.
[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:44.130]  So when updated COVID shots become available in mid-September, we've heard from the FDA and CDC.
[01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:47.730]  They announced this last week that there will be new vaccines.
[01:08:49.889 --> 01:08:55.490]  We in September, next month, mid-September, we'll be encouraging all Americans to get updated
[01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:59.809]  COVID vaccine. Look, because of this work that this president has done from the beginning
[01:08:59.809 --> 01:09:03.090]  of his administration, making sure there was a comprehensive approach with dealing
[01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:08.450]  with this pandemic, with dealing COVID-19, we have tools at our disposal now,
[01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.570]  whether it's vaccines, whether it's home tests, whether it's masks.
[01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:17.250]  We do have an effective treatments, obviously. We do have these tools at our disposal. And I
[01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:20.929]  think that's incredibly important. So I told you this two weeks ago,
[01:09:20.929 --> 01:09:25.010]  here it is. So confirmed, boom, Alex Jones right again. But I wasn't right. I had a
[01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:29.330]  whistleblower confirming their sources. And there it is. And people say, I can't believe
[01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:34.610]  they're trying it again. Well, you're not brainwashed like they are. They've got most
[01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:38.130]  of the cities. They've got the universities. They've got the most of the hospitals.
[01:09:38.929 --> 01:09:43.250]  They've got the military. They've got administrative control. So they're going to
[01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:49.969]  try to force all this again on everybody. And a bunch of people will be bullied and bamboozled
[01:09:49.969 --> 01:09:56.530]  and hoodwinked into it. So it's not a question, are they going to try it?
[01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:04.290]  They are trying it right now. So continue to say no.
[01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:09.170]  And man, there are governors and legislatures and members of Congress,
[01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:12.050]  the House and Senate coming out against this, Trump coming out against it.
[01:10:13.889 --> 01:10:17.889]  James Woods coming out against it, but saying it's a new world order takeover.
[01:10:17.889 --> 01:10:23.330]  They want to enslave you. They're evil. Yes. And again, listeners are like,
[01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:28.130]  we already know that. But it's everybody from Russell Brand to James Woods.
[01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:37.330]  From Tucker Carlson to Joe Rogan. From RFK Jr. to Vivek Ramaswami to the list goes on and on.
[01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:40.450]  From Tulsi Gabbards to you name it. I mean, you've got
[01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:47.490]  Alice Cooper. Love Alice Cooper. Patriot Christian. Best rock show I've ever seen.
[01:10:50.849 --> 01:10:56.290]  Coming out saying, stop targeting our kids trying to sterilize them to trans cult evil.
[01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:59.809]  And now they're trying to pull the sponsors. It doesn't matter. People are going to have to
[01:10:59.809 --> 01:11:05.410]  decide which side they're on now to the Black Rock bullies. It's that simple.
[01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:09.330]  So let's go through a few of these articles. Really good zero hedge.
[01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:10.769]  Brownstone Institute goes through it.
[01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:17.490]  Lockdown 2.0, high school game canceled. Football canceled over outbreak of COVID.
[01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:23.010]  Politicians across America stand within full wars. We will not comply with new COVID lockdowns.
[01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:27.490]  Here's NBC, CBS, all of them fear mongering. New COVID-19 variant.
[01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:37.650]  Piorla BA.2.86 is the most dangerous. Should India be worried? Here's what you need to know.
[01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:47.969]  Earlier testing suggests it goes on and on. So they're in full absolute fear mongering mode
[01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:54.769]  right now. But remember this, new big studies out, go read them for yourself right now.
[01:11:55.650 --> 01:12:00.690]  Half of vaccinated people may never stop producing spike protein, another major study finds.
[01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:06.210]  So yeah, you can be colonized by the virus that's nanotech and produce spike protein,
[01:12:06.769 --> 01:12:11.809]  but nothing compared to the shots. Whether it's virus vector or whether it's mRNA,
[01:12:12.849 --> 01:12:17.650]  they do the same thing. Because that was Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates' prescription.
[01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:25.090]  Make your body produce a poison prion crystal, a protein crystal in your body.
[01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:29.490]  Remember how they were told that the vaccine stays in the arm and
[01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:35.250]  it's harmless spike protein is only produced for a couple of days? They said they were sure
[01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:39.969]  about that despite no data to confirm their statements. That's actually done testing on rats.
[01:12:39.969 --> 01:12:44.210]  They always say never tested actually. It was experimental folks, they knew exactly what it was.
[01:12:44.929 --> 01:12:50.610]  Well, sadly, it turns out they lied to us. The data is now in and it proves such claims wrong.
[01:12:52.450 --> 01:13:00.530]  A clever scientific study by Morgan, just published, detected the presence of spike
[01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:05.010]  protein in COVID vaccinated people six months after vaccination and exclude the possibility of
[01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:09.730]  cross-examination of experimental data with wild circulating COVID injections and they break
[01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:13.490]  down how they did it. So there's already a bunch of other studies that show this,
[01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:20.690]  but overhead shot please, but now it is all scientifically yet again confirmed.
[01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:25.570]  All right. Well, that is an important stack.
[01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:33.570]  But now let's move on to this stack. And this dovetails obviously with it. This is
[01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:38.370]  all interconnected. James Woods, and it's not just his tweets,
[01:13:38.929 --> 01:13:42.370]  it's his statements here. You could read these all day long.
[01:13:43.889 --> 01:13:49.570]  James Woods issues dire warning. They want you in invisible chains. And he goes into how
[01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:57.889]  it's a global takeover. And he embraces America first worldview against the globalists
[01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:02.450]  and absolutely knocks it out of the park.
[01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:09.490]  Again, that's just one more person finally getting, there is a global evil cabal out to
[01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:16.370]  get you. But before we hear that, I want to play clip 11 from yesterday I didn't get to.
[01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:27.969]  This lady is really awesome. I don't know who she is, but the way she looks like a crazy
[01:14:27.969 --> 01:14:32.849]  leftist, the way she says it is so powerful. And again, it fits in perfectly with what James
[01:14:32.849 --> 01:14:38.530]  Woods had to say. Let's go ahead and roll it. We need you to stay in your home for a couple weeks.
[01:14:39.170 --> 01:14:45.490]  It's for the greater good. We need you to close your business just for a short time.
[01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:52.290]  It's for the greater good. Just a little bit longer than two weeks. It's for the greater
[01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:59.490]  good. We need you to wear this on your face. It's for the greater good. We need you to wear
[01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:06.930]  two of these on your face. It's for the greater good. We need you to inject this into your body.
[01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:13.010]  It's for the greater good. We need you to spend the holidays alone. It's for the greater
[01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:20.210]  good. You must inject this into your body. If you want to feed your family. It's for the
[01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:25.809]  greater good. We need you to stop eating that. It's not good for the environment.
[01:15:26.769 --> 01:15:33.090]  It's for the greater good. We need you to stop driving your car and flying. It's for
[01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:39.490]  the greater good. We need you to stop heating your home so often. It's for the greater good.
[01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:46.450]  We need you to stop saying that. It's hurting some people's feelings. This is for the greater good.
[01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:53.170]  We need you to stop having children. It's not good for the planet. This is for the greater
[01:15:53.170 --> 01:16:00.769]  good we need you to stop talking about your faith it's offending people this is for the greater good
[01:16:02.049 --> 01:16:07.730]  we need to separate you from your children because you're not complying this is for the
[01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:14.849]  greater good we need to hold you in a facility for a little while for not cooperating this is
[01:16:14.849 --> 01:16:21.490]  for the greater good well i don't know who she is somebody find out i want her on the show
[01:16:24.049 --> 01:16:26.769]  all right james woods has put a bunch of stuff out
[01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:31.490]  but i want to play this dr michael yeaton clip
[01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:37.809]  dealing with global government and dealing with depopulation here in just a moment as well
[01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:41.170]  i don't know that's all in the list we have that
[01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:49.969]  clip five uh let's go ahead and play this clip this is the former chief scientist
[01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:55.650]  we've had on who's analyzed it and who predicted the blood clots and myocarditis and heart attacks
[01:16:56.690 --> 01:17:02.049]  before it happened and followed an emergency lawsuit in the eu here he is this episode
[01:17:02.049 --> 01:17:07.170]  starting in 2020 is never going to end unless enough just wake up and say to help with it
[01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:12.930]  you know we're not we're not going to comply with this nonsense anymore um and i i think what's
[01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:19.330]  happening here is if we continue we're going to end up all of us carrying digital id you know
[01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:25.010]  you might think digital id is no big deal don't you have digital passports but no there's something
[01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:31.969]  coming and it's definitely coming uh that's different so first your passport is 190
[01:17:31.969 --> 01:17:37.490]  different formats in the world there isn't one format what is coming now globally is a single
[01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:45.250]  format digital id second it will be what's called interoperable when you when your id pings the
[01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:50.049]  system not only can it make a decision as to whether to allow you to enter a door or buy
[01:17:50.049 --> 01:17:55.809]  a product but it can make a mark on that digital id and edit it that's not true of any
[01:17:55.809 --> 01:18:01.250]  idea at the moment that's called interoperability global format and here's the worst part it
[01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:09.090]  contains all of you your health data your unique id data your financial data your driving history
[01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:14.769]  where you live what you've bought that is what is coming down the pipe for us if you don't
[01:18:14.769 --> 01:18:20.370]  believe me then uh i'm just going to paint a picture as to why it's the last important decision
[01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:25.250]  free humans are ever going to make and i'm going to refuse it even though it may exclude me from
[01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:30.450]  banking for example i don't need digital id you don't need digital id evidence for that
[01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:35.490]  my last 63 years of my life they need you to have it the people who have run this pandemic
[01:18:36.130 --> 01:18:41.010]  um what else what are they going to do with this um the other two things that are coming
[01:18:41.010 --> 01:18:46.849]  down the pike are the gradual erosion of cash you will all of you who are listening
[01:18:46.849 --> 01:18:52.130]  to me will be able to see that uh cash is getting harder to obtain and harder to use
[01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:57.330]  and lots of supermarkets are getting rid of humans so it's only a machine and i promise you
[01:18:57.330 --> 01:19:02.530]  as is happening in france and the uk where i live they're abolishing the checkout assistant
[01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:08.290]  you'll only be able to pay with a bank card or an app no cash and finally you can check this
[01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:14.450]  out all central banks are toying with what's called central bank digital currencies you will
[01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:20.290]  bond with the central bank in your country so now let me give you a scenario you walk up to
[01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:26.769]  the shop and you're required to beep your digital id so because we're moving into what
[01:19:26.769 --> 01:19:31.330]  has been described as the zero trust world these are not my words these are their words
[01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:37.010]  zero trust world so you need to prove who you are at every moment you waive your id if they
[01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:42.690]  have decided so because i've said bad things on social media they're not going to admit me to food
[01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:48.049]  stores the door will not open so this is how bad it is let's say they let me in the store
[01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:53.090]  and i had a steak yesterday and i go to the butcher's counter and i pick up some meat and
[01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:58.530]  i go to the automated check app the computer in the sky checks and says you've already had
[01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:02.930]  eight ounces of steak nothing for you and when i try and pay for it the money won't pay for
[01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:09.330]  it or if they say here's something or frighten you because this has happened in britain uh lockdown
[01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:15.809]  climate lockdowns are being mooted it's absurd but they are if they say to you you may not move
[01:20:15.809 --> 01:20:22.049]  more than five miles from your registered address you are six miles from home and go into a store
[01:20:22.049 --> 01:20:27.730]  and you attempt to buy a bottle of water or a sandwich your central bank digital currency
[01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:34.530]  and digital id will prevent that transaction occurring that's what is coming for us so
[01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:39.490]  when they say oh you need a digital id so you can prove who you are tell them to you know
[01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:44.130]  insert it somewhere else you do not need digital ids they need you to have
[01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:50.130]  because that's the control mechanism there are only two parts to it digital id interoperable
[01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:56.930]  one format in the globe and cashless cbdc that's it and then finally i believe this is what's
[01:20:56.930 --> 01:21:03.730]  going to happen i wish it didn't and i praise the god i'm wrong um i think that the third
[01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:09.330]  dimension of this is the population uh why because there's been lots of things that have
[01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:12.769]  happened in the last three and a half years that have actively increased the amount of
[01:21:12.769 --> 01:21:17.889]  injuries and deaths i know it's upsetting for people to hear that but i i am very sure of this
[01:21:17.889 --> 01:21:24.290]  i'm not the only person saying it uh and i pointed out to you as an experienced pharmaceutical researcher
[01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:31.730]  that the design of these mrna based vaccines are inherently dangerous what i can tell you is
[01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:36.210]  the companies and the governments have said they're so happy with the performance of
[01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:41.570]  these products they are busy building factories to manufacture billions of doses of them
[01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:47.889]  around every constant on the world so what i think they're going to do is you'll have your
[01:21:47.889 --> 01:21:53.330]  digital id if you're unwise enough to sign up for it no cash and only central bank digital
[01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:58.930]  currencies that who will tell you there's a pandemic remember they're looking for these
[01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:05.170]  powers right now they'll say there's a pandemic that's their job pharmaceutical companies will
[01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:11.170]  cook up the mrna inverted commons vaccine appropriate and then that's their part and then
[01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:15.170]  the government will tell you you have to have the jab to keep your digital id valid
[01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:20.049]  and i think most people turn up and get the jab and i think over a period of years
[01:22:20.049 --> 01:22:27.330]  the people running this can trim the populations any number they like with plausible deniability
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:34.480]  Very powerful information.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:39.480]  All right, I want to go to this James Woods video he put out. We're going to slow it down so we can read it on air. It's not really
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:45.480]  Indusive for radio. We're going to have a lot of radio stations, but it's very powerful video-wise.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:50.480]  The video's being posted in fullwars.com under the live show feed, but this is just some of the
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:56.480]  videos he's been putting out, the text he's been putting out, saying there's a global government, corporate interests are out to get us,
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:04.480]  They're enslaving us, they want to kill us. And resist the new attempts at lockdowns.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:11.480]  And then we'll go to break in like six minutes and we'll come back with the C40 cities.
[01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:17.480]  And if you think you've heard of 15-minute cities, this is what it's like to live in a 15-minute city.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:23.480]  And this is from the UN, from the WEF, and this is happening in almost every major city in the world.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:28.480]  This isn't coming. This is here. This is how they're going to get you to eat the bugs.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:36.480]  But here's one of the videos that James Woods has put out. I will read this for radio listeners.
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:44.480]  It's just a mask. It's just two meters.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:50.480]  Start over. I messed that up. Because I want to cut this and be able to put this out later.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:59.480]  And I'm sorry. I'm not good at doing things canned here. So we're live on air. Let's start over. Go.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:11.480]  It's just a mask. It's just two meters. It's just three weeks.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:18.480]  It's just non-essential businesses. It's just non-essential workers.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:30.480]  It's just until we work it out. It's just a bar we're closing. It's just a restaurant we're closing.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:39.480]  It's just care homes, nursing homes. You can't visit your family. It's just schools. By the way, you can't visit. The kids are ours.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:46.480]  It's just to keep them. Overwhelmed medical workers able to do their job.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:25:00.480]  It's just until the cases go down. It's just to flatten the curve. Just two weeks. It's just to keep others from being scared.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:10.480]  It's just for a few more weeks. It's just gyms, salons, spas and sports are shut down.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:19.480]  It's just churches and mosques. The big box stores stay open. It's just singing. Don't sing.
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:25.480]  It's just no happy birthday, no shared cakes. You can't visit your folks nursing home when we kill them.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:33.480]  It's just travel. It's just that medical care you needed. It's just three months of lockdown.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:44.480]  It's just some more markings and temporary screens to break the fear of hysteria. It's just a one-way system.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:54.480]  It's just until we get a vaccine that isn't a vaccine that's experimental and dangerous. It's just an app to track and control everything you do.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:26:01.480]  It's just for tracing you. It's just globally set up by the UN. It's just to let people know you're safe to be around.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:13.480]  And we got a UN treaty to run your life too. It's pretty good too. It's just to let others know who you've been in contact with.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:24.480]  It's just for some areas. It's just government guidelines. It's just for your own good.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.480]  Either they're going to have a heart attack, get a stroke or cancer. It's just for protecting others. Don't you want to protect others because we'll be a hero?
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:40.480]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship. Sure, we're banning them. We're blocking therapeutics. It's just mandatory.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:47.480]  It's just the law for now. Remember Biden saying, unvaccinated the enemy?
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:57.480]  It's just scientific fact. Don't question us. That's not science. Not questioning science. It's just only these scientists, not those.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:09.480]  Got a sense of the other scientists. It's just because of the second wave, the third wave, the fourth, the fifth. It's just to save your granny.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:23.480]  It's just another lockdown. It's just for four more weeks. It's just Christmas canceled.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:33.480]  It's just school. They can do it from home. It's just almost a year. It'll be better soon.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:46.480]  It's just a swab. See how we're halfway into it? It's just for medical information. It's just a jab.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:56.480]  It's just a card to store your medical history. It's just so you can travel.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:04.480]  It's just for your passport. It's just permanent. It's just so you can go into stores and pubs, your new social credit score.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:11.480]  Oh, sorry, I'm politically incorrect. It's just so the ADL can track you and your family and your children into school and run your life.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:20.480]  Those are good people. It's just so you can get your driver's license. It's just so you can have a bank.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:33.480]  It's just so you can vote. It's just so you can go to a concert. It's just a facility to keep you separate from others.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:47.480]  It's just a few more years. It's just for those people. It's just just better we keep it this way.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:57.480]  The full video is on Infowars.com. Now is the time to resist and say no. This is a takeover. It's not just, just, just. It's just the end of your life if you submit.

[01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:02.770]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic
[01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:04.970]  5G or the GMO crops.
[01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:09.850]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:11.330]  industry to use.
[01:32:11.330 --> 01:32:14.690]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[01:32:14.690 --> 01:32:18.330]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[01:32:18.330 --> 01:32:23.930]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your sun into a feminized mutant.

[01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:54.550]  For a limited time, we're running a 10% discount.
[01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:55.550]  That is a huge discount.
[01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:56.910]  It's probably the lowest price out there.
[01:32:56.910 --> 01:33:06.450]  You need this filter.
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:25.920]  It's official, the plan to block out the sun can drill you and your family, make you
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:33.680]  eat bugs, cut off your energy sources, castrate your sons, sterilize your daughters.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.040]  Sounds insane, but it's all in the news now and it's coming after you and your family.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:45.680]  And now, plans official, cut down all the trees.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:51.200]  Bill Gates has billions of funding and the chopping of trees has begun.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:02.160]  Bill Gates and other investors are betting Kadama Systems can reduce carbon dioxide in the air
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:09.600]  by chopping down and burying trees, which has raised $6.6 million in seed funding from Bill
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:17.680]  Gates' Breakthrough Energy and others. Scientists say burying trees can reduce global warming as
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.680]  well. I don't know where they find these scientists, by the way. To help address the
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:29.440]  problem, the US Forest Services aims to thin out 70 million acres of western forest, mostly
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:36.160]  in California over the next decade, extracting more than 1 billion tons of bone-dried biomass.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.240]  Normally when you cut down trees, when you're a lumberjack, when you have a lumber company,
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:46.240]  you're selling the lumber to build houses, people buying from Home Depot or whatever.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:52.720]  They're arguing that they want to, rather than sell the timber, take all that wood and just
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.280]  bury it because they're saying that that is a better solution. And so, in other words,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:03.280]  this is a business because they're getting money to create carbon offsets and this is
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.440]  what Bill Gates is financing. That's the epic times.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:17.840]  Okay, so you're like, that's preposterous. That doesn't make sense. Well, it makes perfect
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:24.640]  sense. They've got to have the most insane things. Mothers and fathers are bad.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:32.880]  Babies are bad for the earth. We are carbon. Block out the sun. That's one-fourth or really
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:37.760]  more of the cycle. Without that, we're all dead. But the sun, water, carbon dioxide,
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.600]  oxygen, got to have those four things. They're openly going after two of them right now.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.240]  Well, by cutting down trees that put out the majority of the oxygen, they're going after
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.560]  the other. So one thing they haven't come out against is water, but I expect that imminently.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.280]  I've even done man on the streets years ago where I go out and I say,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  have you heard about this thing that's in the environment called dihydrogen monoxide?
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:06.080]  And it causes excessive urination. It can kill you because if you drowned it, it can.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.560]  And I sit there and talk to them and they go, yeah, let's ban it. I'll sign your petition.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:16.640]  And they go, thank you for banning water. They go, water? Yeah.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:25.840]  Got a scary name, huh? Dihydrogen monoxide, almost as scary as carbon dioxide or oxygen.
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:40.720]  So before we get into that, I'm going to give the number out to take your calls
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:49.680]  on any subject you'd like. But obviously I'd like to talk about if you are witnessing it,
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:55.360]  some of the new COVID attempts at the new rollout. I'd like to get your take on
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:03.440]  any of the news we've already covered here today. The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:13.760]  877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539. All I ask is that you be ready to tell us what you think
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:20.080]  and that you have a clear phone line. Thank you so much. 877-789-Alex.
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.000]  All right, we can spend the whole show on this, but
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:29.280]  I reported on this C40 cities a couple of years ago.
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:37.440]  And then a couple of months ago, I reported on it and there were articles saying Jones is insane.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.960]  He claims these cities want to ban dairy and beef and want to ban cars and want to do all
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.640]  this. And then one of my crew members yesterday texted me yesterday afternoon and said, hey,
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:56.800]  you ought to ask this question at the next prove me wrong deal like we did
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:03.360]  yesterday that is premiering today at ladderwithcrouter.com and jonescrouter.com.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.440]  And the question is, will you give up your cars? Will you give up but only three pairs
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.320]  of clothing a year? You know, you hear all this and they have the fact checkers,
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.040]  the fact checkers come out and they say at the New York Times or else they say,
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.280]  oh, no one wants to do that. And they don't list the C40 city. They don't go there.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.680]  Go watch the videos. Go look at the board to the head of the communist party,
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.600]  the mayor of London, US governors.
[01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:44.730]  The Austin mayor, and it's all run by the UN and the World Economic Forum.
[01:38:44.730 --> 01:38:45.730]  And they're going to reinvent them.
[01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:51.530]  So if you want to know what it's like to live, when you hear about a 15-minute city,
[01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:55.170]  which they're already setting up in the US and in England, where they just block off
[01:38:55.170 --> 01:39:02.250]  the car and say, sorry, that's the way it is, that's what this is.
[01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:08.090]  So here's a Texas scorecard, great publication, did an analysis of this a couple days ago.
[01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:12.890]  Austin and Houston eliminate meat and dairy consumption by 2030.
[01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:20.250]  Then they quote it in the article from the website.
[01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:23.170]  Almost as crazy as two men can have a baby.
[01:39:23.170 --> 01:39:33.170]  And here is C40.org, yes, C4 to blow up society, C40 is a global network of nearly 100 mayors
[01:39:33.170 --> 01:39:40.090]  of the world, leading cities that are united in action to confront the climate crisis.
[01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:43.410]  Raising their climate ambitions to shut down even more ahead of the Paris treaty,
[01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:44.410]  beyond it.
[01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:48.010]  Building equitable and thriving communities, means give themselves a little money.
[01:39:48.010 --> 01:39:50.690]  Building a global movement, look what they've already done to your cities, that's why they're
[01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:53.050]  destroying them first and then come back in with this.
[01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:58.090]  Building up climate action, facilitating access to finance, black rock and the green jobs.
[01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:12.230]  Which they all administer. And China is the main driver and funder of C40 cities. They build three or four coal power plants a week, we tear down three or four a week or more.
[01:40:12.230 --> 01:40:20.230]  But they're there telling us we can't even have natural gas, gasoline, but we can have their toxic solar panels though.
[01:40:20.230 --> 01:40:25.230]  They're incredibly destructive to make, not against solar power, let's just be honest it's about as dirty as it gets.
[01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:36.230]  The way they produce it, just like the batteries. China's coal power binge accelerates. Over 300 more plants on the way just this year. Right part.
[01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:46.230]  Photos, LA's mid-century smog, 67 years ago was so bad people thought it was a gas attack. Truth is our skies are some of the clearest in the world.
[01:40:47.230 --> 01:41:01.230]  And it goes on and on. America's data on trees and carbon dioxide. USA, according to the federal government, produces 5.1 billion metric tons of CO2 a year.
[01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:14.230]  US trees absorb 63 trillion metric tons of CO2 a year. So we want to cut trees down because they grab CO2 out of the atmosphere and then sequester it.
[01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:21.230]  And it's not even released for thousands of years usually, hundreds to thousands depending on how large a tree is.
[01:41:21.230 --> 01:41:31.230]  So their answer is cut them down, but that's how God created balance. Our creator had already provided the solution to the problem.
[01:41:31.230 --> 01:41:36.230]  So that's their so-called science. I'm going to read that to you again.
[01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:49.230]  America, US government data on trees and carbon dioxide. USA produces 5.1 billion metric tons of CO2 a year. US trees absorb 63 trillion metric tons of CO2 a year.
[01:41:49.230 --> 01:41:56.230]  Actually cutting trees down will actually increase CO2. The globalists don't care. It's just all about slaughtering things.
[01:41:57.230 --> 01:42:06.230]  So guys, get a calculator up on screen for me. Can we see what percentage 5.1 billion goes into 63 trillion?
[01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:19.230]  In fact, the earth is very low on carbon right now. Maybe we should cut some, I'm joking, but this is insane.
[01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:25.230]  Because the science, the science. And the average leftist, I want to ask him, so you want to cut trees down?
[01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:35.230]  In fact, when I do that, change my mind. Guys, I gave my sheet I had to Rob Dew about change my mind for next week, but I want to read that change my mind.
[01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:40.230]  So go get it off his desk or I'll grab it during the break. This is wild.
[01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:46.230]  We're going to tie this in with the next phase of their will eat the bugs operation. How do we stop it?
[01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:52.230]  Say when we're stopping the new lockdown saying where you're a fraud, you're a criminal. Hell, no, I'm not complying. How about that?
[01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:56.230]  But they get their central bank digital currency and we're screwed, blued and tattooed.
[01:42:58.230 --> 01:43:05.230]  Coffee has not been available at info war store dot com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:09.230]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[01:43:09.230 --> 01:43:13.230]  But when the folks had been a man came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:19.230]  We finally had three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:25.230]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted. It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[01:43:25.230 --> 01:43:31.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single source Colombian coffees are now available at info war store dot com.
[01:43:31.230 --> 01:43:36.230]  Exclusively escape the prison planet. Light roast tastes great.
[01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:39.230]  It's the strong one. Really strong. But these are all close.
[01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:42.230]  Second and third medium roast. Wake of America.
[01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:49.230]  That's what my go to dark rose tip of the spear taste the best and is amazing and is still very, very strong.
[01:43:49.230 --> 01:43:54.230]  Gives you that path. They're all three available at info war store dot com and they fund our operation.
[01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:58.230]  And each order gets a pocket Constitution citizen rule book.
[01:43:58.230 --> 01:44:03.230]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported info wars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:08.230]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists, the fact that we're not caught flat footed.
[01:44:08.230 --> 01:44:14.230]  During their major takeover is because of you. Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:44:14.230 --> 01:44:16.230]  I just want to thank you all for buying products.
[01:44:16.230 --> 01:44:21.230]  And then for short, I call my books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.
[01:44:21.230 --> 01:44:23.230]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation.
[01:44:23.230 --> 01:44:28.230]  So we get almost 100 percent of the money to fund our operation during this critical time.
[01:44:28.230 --> 01:44:34.230]  Go to info war store dot com and right at the top, you'll see a link to make a straight donation.

[01:44:40.230 --> 01:44:42.230]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:48.230]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening.

[01:44:55.230 --> 01:44:57.230]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[01:44:57.230 --> 01:45:02.230]  The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them.
[01:45:02.230 --> 01:45:06.230]  But the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
[01:45:06.230 --> 01:45:10.230]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy.
[01:45:10.230 --> 01:45:17.230]  Those whose ways are upright, but their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken.
[01:45:17.230 --> 01:45:24.230]  Better the little that have righteousness than the wealth of any wicked for the power of the wicked will be broken.
[01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:27.230]  But the Lord upholds the righteous.
[01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:32.230]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will endure forever.
[01:45:32.230 --> 01:45:35.230]  In times of disaster, they will not wither.
[01:45:35.230 --> 01:45:38.230]  In days of famine, they will have plenty.
[01:45:38.230 --> 01:45:40.230]  But the wicked will perish.
[01:45:40.230 --> 01:45:47.230]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed and they will go up in smoke.
[01:45:54.230 --> 01:46:05.230]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated, high quality bone broth there is.
[01:46:05.230 --> 01:46:08.230]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.

[01:46:16.230 --> 01:46:18.230]  And then it just gets crazier from there.
[01:46:18.230 --> 01:46:21.230]  It's about to sell out. We haven't had it in stock for years.
[01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:23.230]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:06.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:35.340]  But where are the clowns? Send in the clowns. Don't bother, they're here.
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:50.340]  Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? Isn't it queer? Losing my timing this late...
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:55.340]  This is an extremely aggressive group of corporate criminals making a total run at our goodness
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:48:01.340]  to tell us we're bad and let them run our lives and cut our resources off for the Earth.
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:05.340]  We're the clowns, not them, if we let them do this.
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:10.340]  So next week I'm going to go back on the street and ask, near the next Change My Mind,
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:14.340]  are you willing to give up all meat and dairy consumption?
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:18.340]  Number two, are you willing to let government dictate how much clothes you can buy?
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:21.340]  Are you willing to give up your private owned vehicles?
[01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:30.340]  Are you willing to accept one digital currency control by a central bank that decides what you are allowed to purchase?
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:41.340]  That's all in the C40's city plan. And then that ties into this.
[01:48:41.340 --> 01:48:48.340]  CNN. Billionaires add 5 trillion to their fortunes during pandemic.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:55.340]  And now you wonder, and now you know, the rest of the story of why they want more lockdowns.
[01:48:55.340 --> 01:48:59.340]  Because they're not going to be locked down.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:02.340]  This broke yesterday. 61 percent, CNBC.
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:05.340]  61 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:09.340]  Inflation is still squeezing budgets.
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:11.340]  Consumer confidence craters.
[01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:18.340]  Bank to stop giving loans for fossil fuel cars.
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:21.340]  Crime waves.
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:28.340]  And that leads us to this. Bill Gates funds scheme to chop and bury trees to fight climate change.
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:33.340]  And they did the math.
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:37.340]  If you put the. Five.
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:40.340]  Billion metric tons.
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:45.340]  Of CO2 that the U.S. produces, including humans breathing every year.
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:47.340]  It's.
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.340]  24 times more.
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:55.340]  That trees breathe and then sequester CO2, even if you believe it's a bad thing.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:59.340]  Simply astounding.
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:06.340]  Here's CNN plant trees, sure, but to save the climate, we should cut them down.
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:10.340]  Florida's ditching palm trees to fight climate change. They're bad.
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:13.340]  I'll tell you what trees you can have.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:17.340]  Just know that the ones telling you to give everything won't be giving up.
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:19.340]  Anything.
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:22.340]  There's Bill Gates marched into the countryside.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:25.340]  Beautiful trees and grass and sheep and cows and birds.
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:28.340]  What a terrible polluting environment.
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:34.340]  Oh, pesticides and solar panels, dead animals and windmills.
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:38.340]  Oh, this is so good.
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:39.340]  Big push here.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:44.340]  Why we need to give insects the role they deserve in our food system.
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:50.340]  We the U.N. to run our food and control us.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:56.340]  Of course, Elon Musk says the people in the world who are operating under the false pretense or impression that we've got too many people.
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.340]  This is not true.
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:00.340]  Earth could maintain a population many more times the current level.
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:05.340]  But once you cut a peak level, it causes a collapse event.
[01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:15.340]  Millions of bricks told to not heat homes at night to save the earth by the C40 city initiative.
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:17.340]  But don't forget they've got weather weapons.
[01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:26.340]  And here it is in a 1965 document from the U.S. government admitting it all.
[01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:36.340]  So we now have James Woods coming out saying it's a global government tyrants that want to depopulate us.
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:38.340]  You got the former chief science advisor saying it.
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:42.340]  I mean, basically everybody who is on the bad guys team saying it.
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:46.340]  And Ramaswami, who, again, I love his rhetoric.
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:47.340]  People say, I don't trust him.
[01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:48.340]  He should be a leftist.
[01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:52.340]  Are we not allowed to have people switch sides?
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:52:02.340]  Ramaswami, today's politicians are hollowed out huts serving as puppets to the globalist machine.
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:09.340]  And, man, is that not 110% totally and completely true.
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:11.340]  Now, here's what I want to do.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:14.340]  I want to go to your phone calls for a while.
[01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:17.340]  And then I've got a big stack on the ADL.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:22.340]  The ADL is just one component of the private corporate globalist intelligence agency takeover.
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:25.340]  What they're doing is totally illegal, as you saw in Congress.
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:27.340]  But they're getting a pass.
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:32.340]  Big tech, the Justice Department, the CIA are getting in trouble for illegally spying using taxpayer money.
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:37.340]  The ADL is at the heart of this.
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:41.340]  And it's been the top trend the last day and a half on Twitter and other places.
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:43.340]  Abolish the ADL.
[01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:45.340]  Or ban the ADL.
[01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:48.340]  Now, I don't want to ban my political opposition like they want to do me.
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:53.340]  I want to point out the ADL is a sophisticated style.
[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:57.340]  And it's designed to create a dialectic.
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:00.340]  And I'll explain that coming up.
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:02.340]  And I know you're smart enough to understand it.
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:07.340]  So we're going to be laying it all out after we take phone calls.
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:12.340]  And then I've got major whistleblower steps forward, reveals private Facebook group.
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:14.340]  That's how we're going to get them.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:21.340]  Where state clerks discussed stunning evidence of organized fraud in the 2020 election.
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:28.340]  So they're desperate to put Trump in jail for questioning the election because they know they've been caught doing it.
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:31.340]  That's all coming up.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:37.340]  Now, before I go any further here today, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:40.340]  I personally have to pay my legal bills.
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:42.340]  The court has ruled I have to pay for half the bills.
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:45.340]  Free speech is on air. I don't have any money.
[01:53:45.340 --> 01:53:48.340]  And my back bills of the year are a little over a million dollars.
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.340]  Sounds like a lot.
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.340]  Trump's already spent almost $70 million this year alone.
[01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:54.340]  You want us to fight the globalist?
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:56.340]  Sounds like big numbers. It's not, folks.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.340]  We need your support.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:59.340]  It's a decision you've got to make.
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:01.340]  My products at foreshore.com that enrich your life, they're great.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:02.340]  That funds free speech.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:05.340]  The judge has said I've got to pay half the legal bills and everything else.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:06.340]  I can't do it.
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:08.340]  So this is our chicken and the armor.
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:13.340]  And we'll have to shut down pretty soon.
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:16.340]  And then as soon as it's shut down, we'll get all the money.
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:19.340]  Once you start this, you can't stop this.
[01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:21.340]  So I'm firing the bat signal.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:22.340]  I appreciate all your ongoing support.
[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:24.340]  We're in a major toe-to-toe battle, long-term war.
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:26.340]  I'm sorry I got to keep asking for support.
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:31.340]  But I'm asking you humbly to keep us on air to go to defendjones.com.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:33.340]  A give, send, go account, defendjones.com.
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:35.340]  And I appreciate those that donated in the past.
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:36.340]  I appreciate everybody that supported the show.
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:38.340]  You know who you are.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:40.340]  We've raised like $25,000 in the last couple hours.
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.340]  That sounds great.
[01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:44.340]  I've got a million-dollar problem.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.340]  I think in the next month you're going to come through.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.340]  I think we'll raise it.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:49.340]  Unlike selling a million dollars of supplements,
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:52.340]  and we make $300,000 or $400,000,
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:55.340]  or we sell water filters, a million dollars of water filters,
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.340]  and we make $200,000.
[01:54:57.340 --> 01:54:58.340]  I'm not complaining.
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:54:59.340]  We don't put a lot of markup in there.
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:00.340]  They're high quality.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:02.340]  Let me give you the best deals.
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:04.340]  This is how my brain works.
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.340]  People say, I just have bigger markup.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.340]  You don't have any problems.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.340]  I just can't do it.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:11.340]  But I'm separate from the free speech bankruptcy,
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:13.340]  and I'm out of money.
[01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:15.340]  And we're actually winning these cases, as you see.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:16.340]  They're really freaked out.
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:18.340]  So I need your support.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.340]  It's a long-term fight.
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:20.340]  We fought so long.
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.340]  You can decide whether you want to give up or not.
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.340]  I know you don't want to, most of you.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:26.340]  But I wanted to read some of the great comments.
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:28.340]  We've had some big donations, small donations.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:29.340]  They're all wonderful.
[01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:32.340]  We appreciate you at defendjones.com.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:35.340]  Anonymously, privately, you can give or you can comment if you want.
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:37.340]  This is anonymous donor.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:38.340]  One minute ago, $50.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:40.340]  Bless you, Alex and M4s.
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.340]  Bless you, too.
[01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:44.340]  Taylor gave $30.
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.340]  I am going broke, but the dollar won't be around much longer anyways.
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:49.340]  Exactly, folks.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:50.340]  You've got to put money in to win.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:53.340]  Hope to see lots of engagement with this fund.
[01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:54.340]  We'll stay on air.
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:56.340]  That's what will happen.
[01:55:56.340 --> 01:55:58.340]  Anonymous donor, $50.
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:00.340]  Thank you for your work.
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:01.340]  Thank you.
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:02.340]  Alex from Ohio, $10.
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:04.340]  Listening to M4 is 20 years.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:09.340]  95% correct accuracy rate of geopolitical diagnosis and cure rate.
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:11.340]  Vincent, $30.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.340]  Thank you.
[01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:16.340]  Alex, you woke me up in the early 2000s when 9-11 wrote a tyranny,
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:18.340]  and I've been a regular listener and contributor since 2007.
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.340]  Thank you.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:20.340]  You are the M4.
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:22.340]  I'm praying for you and President Trump on a regular basis.
[01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:25.340]  Stay strong, and thank you for doing what you're doing, brother.
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:27.340]  Vincent, thank you, Vincent.
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:30.340]  Karma, $3,000.
[01:56:33.340 --> 01:56:35.340]  Opposition in all things.
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:37.340]  Anonymous, $1,000.
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:38.340]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.340]  No, thank you, Anonymous.
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:40.340]  Thank you, Karma.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:44.340]  Jesus, we love you, Alex and crew.
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:47.340]  God's continuing blessing upon you and yours.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:50.340]  Mike Lenum, $1,000.
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:51.340]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:52.340]  Anonymous donor, $10.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:57.340]  The Bible says if God is for me, who can be against me in the fight?
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:57:02.340]  And with Jesus by your side, fighting darkness, you'll prevail.
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:06.340]  The kingdom of darkness doesn't stand a chance because we already have the victory.
[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:08.340]  My prayers go with you, Alex.
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:10.340]  And may the Holy Spirit give you peace.
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:11.340]  Thank you. Amen.
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.340]  That's just some of the comments.
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:13.340]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:14.340]  That means so much.
[01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:16.340]  Please go to defendjones.com.
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.340]  And if you want to keep me in the fight, it's your decision.
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:20.340]  I'm not saying you should, not trying to make you do it.
[01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:21.340]  Keep this dog in the fight.
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:24.340]  You think I'm doing a good job or trying my best and donate now?
[01:57:24.340 --> 01:57:26.340]  Action is victory.
[01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:28.340]  Resistance is victory.
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:29.340]  It is in your court.
[01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:33.340]  It is your decision whether to pull the plug on this operation or not.
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:34.340]  Please spread the word.
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:35.340]  Please spread the rubchests.
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:39.340]  The same time, infoarswars.com, body is a little bit too formula.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:40.340]  Now, back it stopped.
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:42.340]  Support info wars but yes, support me as well.
[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:44.340]  Because I can be shut down.
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:45.340]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:49.340]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:50.340]  I thought it was next week.
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:53.340]  Next week I come in this morning. It's back in the warehouse ready to roll
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:59.540]  Bodies ultimate every formula and the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:05.820]  Overhead shot, please look how full this bottle is
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.020]  right to the top folks
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:12.020]  Right to the top with these
[01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:15.380]  95% to humanoid
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:22.000]  Again most tumeric formulas are 5% some are maybe 10 the other strongest brands are 75%
[01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:24.540]  this is

[02:10:55.950 --> 02:11:02.349]  that the election is already over before it's over and that ai predicted that trump will lose
[02:11:03.150 --> 02:11:08.030]  well that's right in fact um they just had claus Schwab a month ago with the head of google
[02:11:08.990 --> 02:11:14.990]  or one of the founders larry page that was sergey brenn and they said soon the ai will tell
[02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:20.990]  you who wins so no more election computer tell you so yeah it's all a big foregone conclusion thing
[02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:29.389]  yes so then also on the ukraine russia war front i don't know if you saw the rumor from rumors
[02:11:29.389 --> 02:11:37.070]  from chesnian soldiers who said at night there are large drones coming with claws and scooping
[02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:41.950]  up their wounded and taking them for organ harvesting i thought that was in your wheelhouse
[02:11:42.990 --> 02:11:46.590]  well i don't know about drones doing it but they've caught the ukrainians
[02:11:47.309 --> 02:11:51.150]  harvesting both ukrainian and russian troops and selling their organs that's confirmed
[02:11:52.190 --> 02:11:58.830]  yeah it was happening in the balkan wars they were doing a live organ harvesting and i also
[02:11:58.830 --> 02:12:05.150]  think that organ harvesting tied in with blue beam the alien stuff is a good alien abduction
[02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:10.030]  stuff is a good cover for the organ harvesting and adrenochrome well i don't even need to do it
[02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:14.430]  with some claw at night with a drone i mean it came out in the news even on 16 minutes a lot
[02:12:14.430 --> 02:12:20.830]  of hospitals will kill you they've got bad managers for your organs yeah they said they
[02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:26.349]  were doing with the claw and drone the large drones for spraying like pesticides on farmland
[02:12:26.349 --> 02:12:30.110]  and they send the drones in so they don't have to send soldiers in to get them and
[02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:36.830]  they have thermal cameras who knows if it's true but in this i don't mind speculation
[02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:42.190]  we have it confirmed that millions of aborted babies in the u.s have their organs harvested
[02:12:42.190 --> 02:12:47.469]  that's in federal documents it's not debatable yes yes yes and because of you i don't know if
[02:12:47.469 --> 02:12:53.870]  you realize i think you should all you and owen should uh you know um every day um take note
[02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:59.469]  that you know they already say about 33 000 uh babies have been saved with the overturning
[02:12:59.469 --> 02:13:04.269]  of row versus weight that's seven pounds a baby that's like quarter million pounds of babies

[02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:14.349]  frank in new jersey on the new lockdowns they're trying to impose the white house now admits it
[02:13:14.349 --> 02:13:21.070]  go ahead hi alex it's honored to speak with you so my prediction is with these new lockdowns
[02:13:21.070 --> 02:13:26.030]  how do they get the people to stay home they start the digital currency on your phone
[02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:30.670]  so they force you to stay home where your phone always has to be with you so i meant to
[02:13:30.670 --> 02:13:37.550]  make that point when i got into the c40 uh cities is they say if you don't eat beef you let
[02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:42.990]  us track you and you don't have a car and you do what we say we will give you a 200 square foot
[02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:47.630]  coffin apartment and we will then pay for your whole life you just lay around
[02:13:47.630 --> 02:13:49.710]  so that's how they're going to get the first groups to do it
[02:13:51.389 --> 02:13:56.030]  i'm with you 100 and that's the way i was seeing it as well as they're moving
[02:13:56.030 --> 02:14:02.110]  to reward you to stay home and follow their directions we're not having a life anymore locked
[02:14:02.110 --> 02:14:06.830]  into your apartment just the same way like they give you the gems on these stupid games on
[02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:12.190]  all these phones you watch a 30-second commercial they give you a reward so they'll give you a reward
[02:14:12.190 --> 02:14:16.590]  for staying home for a week an extra 200 it's like when they put cheese out for a mouse if
[02:14:16.590 --> 02:14:20.430]  the mouse knew it was a trap he wouldn't get in it we have to not play the game what are
[02:14:20.430 --> 02:14:26.430]  they saying that great 1980s movie war games the only way to win is not to play that's true
[02:14:27.550 --> 02:14:32.430]  and the sad thing is my friends and i are all starting to say the same thing we're glad
[02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:37.070]  we're at the end of our lives just because of seeing what's going on in this world
[02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:43.870]  well brother it's all an animating contest of liberty it's all a test so use the time you
[02:14:43.870 --> 02:14:48.269]  have left frank to defend as many innocent people and wake up as many people as you can
[02:14:48.269 --> 02:14:52.670]  and be fearless brother because this is an amazing time to be alive brother thank you for the call
[02:14:54.590 --> 02:14:56.750]  all right let's take a call from
[02:14:56.750 --> 02:15:01.550]  margie in minnesota margie you're on the air go ahead
[02:15:03.389 --> 02:15:09.309]  hi alex i'm so glad you're feeling better you sound amazing and your spirits are up i can tell
[02:15:10.269 --> 02:15:13.870]  i was a little under the weather last week got a little bit of a laryngitis but i'm better
[02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:18.990]  now thank you you're doing good hey i want to comment first of all on the electric
[02:15:18.990 --> 02:15:25.550]  air filter one thing you're failing to talk about alex and i've i love to cook and have
[02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:32.990]  people over the water everyone comments how well and amazing the water tastes
[02:15:33.630 --> 02:15:39.150]  which is important it's very important you know you think what the everything you're taking out
[02:15:39.150 --> 02:15:42.510]  of there you know what's it going to taste like because they put stuff in it to make it
[02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:49.550]  taste good right and i get so many compliments that the water tastes so good and people have
[02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:54.510]  got friends have gone out and bought them so anyways i just wanted to get that out i'm
[02:15:54.510 --> 02:16:00.590]  gonna make a comment on that folks i don't like conscious i'll get things wrong but
[02:16:00.590 --> 02:16:05.469]  when i went out and got alexapure water filtration systems now over a decade ago
[02:16:05.469 --> 02:16:09.710]  it was because they were the highest rated stainless steel gravity fed filter
[02:16:09.710 --> 02:16:15.550]  that cut thousands of chemicals out by 99.99999 percent and thousands of chemicals are
[02:16:15.550 --> 02:16:19.790]  non-detectable meaning even the best spectrometers can't pick anything up so you're
[02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:24.990]  getting a top rate top of the line gravity fed filter at the lowest price out there so
[02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:30.670]  i mean i don't ever sell somebody something that i'm not personally using so i'm glad that people
[02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:35.470]  like to filter oh they love it and i've been over to friends where they have those filters
[02:16:35.470 --> 02:16:41.950]  in the refrigerator yuck the water is disgusting i don't even want to mix it with my windsor
[02:16:41.950 --> 02:16:45.070]  well that's something everybody's supposed to listen to because a lot of those little filters
[02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:49.150]  in refrigerators just cut out taste and they reduce some bad stuff too i mean it's better
[02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:53.550]  than nothing but you got to get rid of those every year or so if you're using the water
[02:16:54.110 --> 02:17:00.510]  so because once they get filled with toxins they now are concentrated toxins once a
[02:17:01.550 --> 02:17:05.869]  filter system is used so anybody that's got alexapure water filtration system
[02:17:05.869 --> 02:17:09.550]  after it does the ten thousand gallons or whatever it is ten thousand gallons
[02:17:09.550 --> 02:17:15.869]  you got to replace the filters yeah i think it's five thousand for a filter but you know
[02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:20.750]  additionally i bought it because um and i bought my all my filters from you too
[02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:28.030]  um just to prepare for stuff one of my dogs was diagnosed with bone cancer
[02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:34.590]  and then doing my own research that uh what you get from unfiltered water from what they're
[02:17:34.590 --> 02:17:39.789]  feeding us is the number one cause of bone cancer that's a that's an admitted fact
[02:17:40.670 --> 02:17:45.950]  yep and you know i switched about a year and a half ago and she was supposed to be dead a year
[02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:52.590]  ago in august and she's thriving better than ever i don't know i'm not saying the
[02:17:52.590 --> 02:18:02.270]  election pure cuter but it sure did help so anyway um i think prompt and uh roma swami for
[02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:08.030]  the vp what do you think well i don't i love rama swati's rhetoric and i he used to be a
[02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:12.750]  liberal so we don't totally trust him but i like what he's doing now and if i see anything weird i'll
[02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:16.190]  come out against him but i think we should give him the benefit of the doubt you know christ is
[02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:19.869]  on the cross with the thief of the murderer and one of them believes he can be healed and
[02:18:19.869 --> 02:18:24.430]  get forgiven the other does and he says well to one of them to you know tonight i'll see you
[02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:29.630]  in paradise so uh yeah i mean i i think that's why the whole media is coming out against rama
[02:18:29.630 --> 02:18:35.150]  swami and so i'm not saying he's perfect i'm not endorsing him but i do endorse what he says
[02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:41.630]  yes yes and a lot of people are spreading rumors on the internet that he's a globalist
[02:18:41.630 --> 02:18:45.710]  and he's the you know this and that well they said that about you they said that about trump
[02:18:45.710 --> 02:18:50.510]  it's all a sign up if you ask my opinion is to get us to turn away i totally agree with you
[02:18:50.510 --> 02:18:57.550]  they use it against me that my uncle was an iran contra and i talked about it and he was a great
[02:18:57.550 --> 02:19:03.230]  guy and it was the main reason i'm awake and they go oh his uncle worked for the cia i said that
[02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:08.110]  25 years ago he'd say please shut up he's dead now i can talk about it but the point is he told
[02:19:08.110 --> 02:19:13.390]  me all this stuff he was good it's not like oh they found out this and so i mean like if my
[02:19:13.390 --> 02:19:18.830]  dad was a murderer which he's not am i guilty because he was no but the point is is that is
[02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:25.950]  that like like snowden people don't trust snowden because he exposed the cia illegal spying they
[02:19:25.950 --> 02:19:32.990]  want to kill snowden he had to run to russia of course he's for real and and and so we've
[02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:37.789]  got to be ready to have defectors come over to our side and then and then i mean we turn
[02:19:37.789 --> 02:19:42.990]  our back on them at first but look snowden's for real assange is for real i'm for real
[02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:50.110]  and the idea uh that people then say that we're feds or something is is is it is a
[02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:58.750]  psi out by some bad guys but that's who puts it out and i noticed the media big tech
[02:19:59.710 --> 02:20:06.590]  boost all the attacks on us from them but it's the grassroots people that want to feel really
[02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:14.990]  powerful and so if they could say oh alex yones is controlled opposition that makes them feel big
[02:20:15.789 --> 02:20:20.110]  that makes them feel like well i'm i'm better than him i look great you're better than me i'm
[02:20:20.110 --> 02:20:24.910]  bad okay whatever believe your life go out and help some people instead of running around
[02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:29.789]  attacking patriots all day because i mean i i know so many people that just spend all
[02:20:29.789 --> 02:20:34.430]  day attacking truck is not perfect but they spend no time attacking biden or the globalist
[02:20:34.430 --> 02:20:40.030]  or the adl or the new world order and it's just stupid and people see through that no i'm
[02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:46.750]  persecuted i'm under massive attack i'm a hundred percent real and they know that not a hundred
[02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:51.550]  percent perfect i make mistakes but i love god i love the truth thank you for the call
[02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:57.230]  margie uh justin in ohio justin you're on the air go ahead
[02:20:58.510 --> 02:21:04.430]  hey alex how you doing good brother hey um i just wanted to bring your attention i should
[02:21:04.430 --> 02:21:10.510]  have called in several months ago but uh my wife she works for a medical procurement company
[02:21:11.789 --> 02:21:19.390]  getting in june there was a 67 increase in mask orders adult sizes kid sizes
[02:21:19.950 --> 02:21:26.030]  um covet test um so obviously she she brought that to my attention i was like man this is
[02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:30.750]  they're probably gonna roll it back out for the election because and by the way i believe you
[02:21:30.750 --> 02:21:35.869]  you're a credible guy but i don't need to even believe you you don't need to believe me it's in
[02:21:35.869 --> 02:21:41.310]  the federal purchase orders that they just bought record amounts of it so yeah they're
[02:21:41.310 --> 02:21:48.830]  rolling it out now right absolutely so i mean i guess my second point would be i believe this
[02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:54.110]  is a a complete backup plan because i don't think these trumps of these charges on trump are going
[02:21:54.110 --> 02:22:00.750]  to stick so they need a backup plan they need to have these mail-in ballots um to try to steal
[02:22:00.750 --> 02:22:05.550]  the election once again i think that's where we're at and i think that's going to be the
[02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:11.630]  tipping point for a lot of people unfortunately in this country um you know we can't go another
[02:22:11.630 --> 02:22:15.869]  four years the leadership that we've had or lack there well i think what you just said
[02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:21.390]  justin is so key it's a tipping point and you noticed two weeks ago we announced the new
[02:22:21.390 --> 02:22:25.950]  lockdowns they have planned people exploded with resistance so i think we've already reached
[02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:34.110]  the tipping point yeah i agree um i'm actually surprised um i'm impressed with the american people
[02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:39.869]  um for not acting out as we rightfully should i mean we've been attacked look what what's
[02:22:39.869 --> 02:22:44.510]  happened in hawaii um they've come after our kids i mean we're getting attacked from all angles
[02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:51.150]  um they're attacking the family the nuclear family and they're attacking religion um
[02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:57.070]  christianity so it's it's clearly out in the open what they're trying to do um they're right
[02:22:57.070 --> 02:23:00.990]  and these are captured agents of evil from the top all the way down the bottom
[02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:05.470]  and they just have a rage because they know their time is short to destroy us and get us
[02:23:05.470 --> 02:23:11.390]  and they are just strutting around pissing on our faces doing every horrible thing they can
[02:23:11.390 --> 02:23:17.789]  and they're destroying themselves yep absolutely and a few colors ago i know he said he's a
[02:23:17.789 --> 02:23:23.710]  little later in life and he said you know he's he's he's happy i wouldn't say happy but glad that
[02:23:23.710 --> 02:23:28.590]  his time is near whatever he said but i would i would just encourage people that might have
[02:23:28.590 --> 02:23:34.750]  that mindset to to be excited for this time that we've been given because we're in a time
[02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:40.430]  in history where we can stand up for our kids we can stand up for generations to come and
[02:23:40.430 --> 02:23:42.510]  it's going to take strong people to stand in that gap
[02:23:42.690 --> 02:24:01.690]  I totally agree. In fact, I wanted to say that to him that, hey man, this is a historic crossroads. I know it's depressing at one level, but it shows evil's real, God's real, and as things get worse and worse, people are going to listen to those of us telling the truth more than ever. God bless you, Justin.
[02:24:02.690 --> 02:24:16.690]  So you heard Justin. Folks in his life that work as medical workers say, massive increase in PPE, mask, and preparedness items for COVID. I mean, it's here.
[02:24:17.690 --> 02:24:30.690]  The good news is they wanted to roll it out without us resisting it, and we are resisting it. So here we are, and we're in this paradox of, yeah, you need to wear masks again, we're going to shut the schools down, got to take the shot, contact tracers, yeah, we got to do more testing.
[02:24:31.690 --> 02:24:43.690]  But nobody's planning to bring it back. Just sit down and take it. Well, we're not sitting down and taking it. Let's go to Logan in Oregon. Logan, thanks for calling.
[02:24:44.690 --> 02:24:46.690]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:48.690]  Welcome.
[02:24:49.690 --> 02:24:56.690]  So I just wanted to thank you for being a freedom fighter, and no matter what the globalists try to do to you, you never back down. So thank you for that.
[02:24:56.690 --> 02:25:07.690]  Now, the one thing I wanted to mention is that I just found out recently the VPN that me and my significant other are using was purchased by the World Economic Forum recently.
[02:25:08.690 --> 02:25:10.690]  Wow. So elaborate on that.
[02:25:11.690 --> 02:25:23.690]  So back in early 2021, we decided to boot Gmail, get rid of our cell phones, and go find a VPN that would be a little more protective for our information.
[02:25:24.690 --> 02:25:33.690]  So we found one called ProtonMail, and at the time, they talked about not being a part of the Nine Eyes countries. They would pull their servers if anybody tried to get their information.
[02:25:34.690 --> 02:25:41.690]  Well, recently my significant other started thinking maybe we should check to see who owns them because there was no issues with them back then.
[02:25:42.690 --> 02:25:58.690]  So she actually started looking into it, and I'm on their website right now. If you type in W-E-F proton, you pull up the World Economic Forum's website, and they're plugging ProtonMail.
[02:25:59.690 --> 02:26:04.690]  So now we've got to get rid of ProtonMail and switch everything over to somebody else that's not a globalist.
[02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:12.690]  Yeah, I'm not denying what you're saying is true. I haven't had time to look into it, but imagine you're the globalist, and you have 50 quadrillion fake dollars.
[02:26:13.690 --> 02:26:17.690]  And that's why they had to burn out Lahaina in Maui. They wouldn't sell.
[02:26:18.690 --> 02:26:23.690]  And so they're going to bring in a social credit score and say, cut your son's penis off, we'll give you money. I mean, it's that simple.
[02:26:23.690 --> 02:26:30.690]  And they're so mad that they've got all this fake money they gave themselves, but we won't take their money. And so, yeah, that's how they do it.
[02:26:31.690 --> 02:26:39.690]  They buy everything up, and who won't sell? We're an example. They come after. That's why you've got listeners. You've got to back the people they're after.
[02:26:40.690 --> 02:26:50.690]  I mean, you cannot understate this. You cannot overstate this. This is such a big deal.
[02:26:50.690 --> 02:27:00.690]  So I'm glad you researched that. So the WEF on their website, what did you search to find that? They use ProtonMail now?
[02:27:01.690 --> 02:27:08.690]  You can just type in WEF Proton, and you'll see that you'll come to a site. You pull it up. Let me back out here real quick.
[02:27:09.690 --> 02:27:15.690]  Yeah, because ProtonMail is what, not WikiLeaks, Veritas and everybody was using it. Wow.
[02:27:15.690 --> 02:27:26.690]  That's one of the reasons we went with it, too, because back when they were legit with James O'Keefe, and they still advertise, without O'Keefe, they still advertise ProtonMail on their site.
[02:27:27.690 --> 02:27:38.690]  And I've heard other people talk about ProtonMail, and we're like, okay, other freedom fighters, and we had to go on the Wayback Machine to find out when it showed up on the World Economic Forum site.
[02:27:38.690 --> 02:27:45.690]  And there's hardly any information, but via the Wayback Machine, you're able to find that it showed up in October of 2022.
[02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:49.690]  All right, well, I'm not defending ProtonMail because I don't know, and the crew's pulling it up right now.
[02:27:50.690 --> 02:27:59.690]  But the WEF will also claim they own or run things they don't as a reverse sign-off. So we need to get a press release and a response from ProtonMail.
[02:28:00.690 --> 02:28:06.690]  I'll get our, hey guys, put like a Don Salazar, or maybe Kellen McBreen, or put one of the riders on this. Let's find out what's going on, okay?
[02:28:06.690 --> 02:28:12.690]  I want to make sure these guys are legit and not globalists now.
[02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:17.690]  Absolutely. Thank you, Logan. We'll look into it right now. Thank you. That's why I love taking calls, man.
[02:28:18.690 --> 02:28:27.690]  So many of our big stories come originally from a caller, and that's why I love taking calls and love reading your emails, which I can't respond to.
[02:28:28.690 --> 02:28:33.690]  I give you a fake auto response, folks, but we need a lot of them, but if we don't respond the first time, just keep hitting us.

[02:33:41.210 --> 02:33:59.090]  Mother, tell your children not to walk my way, tell your children not to hear my words,
[02:33:59.090 --> 02:34:08.570]  what they mean, what they say Mother, mother, mother, can you keep them
[02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:15.570]  in the dark for life, in the dark for life, can you hide up from the waiting world,
[02:34:15.570 --> 02:34:28.570]  waiting world, oh mother, oh mother, father, father, gonna take your daughter out tonight,
[02:34:28.570 --> 02:34:44.570]  gonna show her, gonna show her my world, father, and I'm about to see your light,
[02:34:44.570 --> 02:34:56.570]  but if you wanna find help, I can show you what it's like, till you're bleeding,
[02:34:57.570 --> 02:35:00.570]  all right, let me give you some inside baseball right now before I go back to your
[02:35:00.570 --> 02:35:02.570]  calls on this live Friday broadcast.
[02:35:02.570 --> 02:35:24.570]  Mother, tell your children not to hold my hand, tell your children not to understand,
[02:35:24.570 --> 02:35:40.570]  mother, oh mother, oh, do you wanna pay hands with me, do you wanna feel everything,
[02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:53.570]  oh, father, I'm not about to see your light, but if you wanna find help,
[02:35:53.570 --> 02:35:59.570]  I'm not about this, and I'm not gonna talk about any private conversations, but I can
[02:35:59.570 --> 02:36:06.770]  tell you something, the global is really messed up, I know the biggest talk show
[02:36:06.770 --> 02:36:12.170]  host in the world, I actually know them all, I know Joe Rogan very well, Carlson
[02:36:12.170 --> 02:36:14.370]  very well, I know, I know them all.
[02:36:14.610 --> 02:36:24.130]  And the ones you think I don't know, I do know, the ones on our side.
[02:36:24.130 --> 02:36:34.690]  And they really messed up in the last year threatening people and threatening their lives.
[02:36:34.690 --> 02:36:39.530]  And that's why you're seeing what you're seeing, because see, these globalists are followers,
[02:36:39.530 --> 02:36:44.270]  they're cowards, they're ass-kissers, and they want to work for Satan, they want
[02:36:44.310 --> 02:36:49.350]  to work for the New World Order, they want to bow down.
[02:36:49.350 --> 02:37:00.350]  There are a lot of people out there that stood on the sideline until they got threatened.
[02:37:00.350 --> 02:37:08.470]  And the globalists thought that when they punched somebody in the nose, they'd be like
[02:37:08.470 --> 02:37:13.430]  them and get in a catatonic position and piss all over themselves.
[02:37:13.430 --> 02:37:18.270]  But I knew who you were, I know all of you very well, I think you're just like me.
[02:37:18.270 --> 02:37:21.790]  And you know what, my gut is right, you are just like me.
[02:37:21.790 --> 02:37:24.650]  You don't want to live as a slave, you're not rolling over and bowing down, and you're
[02:37:24.650 --> 02:37:27.990]  done playing games.
[02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:33.030]  So yeah, the new big top yahoo story is, old Russian propaganda says they're going
[02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:35.350]  to kill Tucker Carlson.
[02:37:35.350 --> 02:37:39.990]  Well don't think Tucker Carlson hadn't been threatened, and don't think I haven't been
[02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:43.070]  threatened, and don't think we haven't been following around, and don't think we haven't
[02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:49.510]  been jacked with, and don't think that's why we're fighting harder than ever.
[02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:55.110]  Because if you want to bang heads with me, I can show you what it's like.
[02:37:55.110 --> 02:38:02.910]  So with the top of drugs saying Tucker assassination fear, that's a message to Tucker.
[02:38:02.910 --> 02:38:07.230]  Because everybody's already talking about that, but oh the Russians said it, but it's
[02:38:07.230 --> 02:38:13.590]  really the media picking it up to tell Tucker, you shut your mouth or we're going to blow
[02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:16.550]  your airplane up.
[02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:21.990]  Well, good luck with that.
[02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:26.670]  Because if you strike down Tucker Carlson, he'll become more powerful than you can possibly
[02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:31.670]  imagine.
[02:38:31.670 --> 02:38:34.550]  But it's crazy with the new world where they threaten me and stuff and they say the
[02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:41.270]  horrible things they can do, the subsidiaries, the intermediaries, the proxies, and I always
[02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:46.310]  sit back and say on air, but in person, gee I didn't know you were bad people, you
[02:38:46.310 --> 02:38:51.510]  just smuggle kids all over the world, oh, oh, oh, oh, you mean you could set me
[02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:57.630]  up with a grand jury and put me in prison, oh you could take everything I got, hold
[02:38:57.630 --> 02:39:00.950]  on a minute, I thought you were these bad evil people I was fighting, I didn't know
[02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:13.790]  you were bad and evil, I didn't know you want to hurt me, geez, I better give up right
[02:39:13.790 --> 02:39:14.790]  now.
[02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:19.630]  Because they're like, hey, we're a bunch of cowards and we're going to really hurt
[02:39:19.630 --> 02:39:27.630]  you bad, you're going to hurt me, oh my gosh, you know, I'm actually afraid to become
[02:39:27.630 --> 02:39:31.510]  like 90 years old and not be able to get up out of bed and all the rest of it, I don't
[02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:37.230]  want to die, I don't have a death wish, but I do want to die with a sword in my hand.
[02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:42.410]  And a sword in my hand means being on air against you, you could put a gun to my
[02:39:42.410 --> 02:39:48.830]  head, or my children for that matter, you're going to kill them anyways, if we lose,
[02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:57.070]  and that's what they can't stand is our total commitment against them.
[02:39:57.070 --> 02:40:00.350]  There's a freedom in total commitment.
[02:40:00.350 --> 02:40:06.110]  There's a freedom that I wish those of you that never experienced it could taste.
[02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:10.390]  Total commitment.
[02:40:10.390 --> 02:40:12.550]  Total means complete.
[02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:14.270]  Total means absolute.
[02:40:14.270 --> 02:40:19.830]  Total means all the way.
[02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:25.890]  So it's a prediction I've not made.
[02:40:25.890 --> 02:40:33.670]  And I guess I kind of did a little bit in the start of the show today, but I said we're
[02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:39.210]  in the season, we're in the time of assassination.
[02:40:39.210 --> 02:40:44.910]  So it goes without saying in a globalist coup, the top of the execution list is Donald
[02:40:44.910 --> 02:40:52.590]  Trump, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones.
[02:40:52.590 --> 02:41:04.190]  And because the system trying to push around other people didn't work, Joe Rogan, notice
[02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:06.510]  Joe Rogan's gotten real hardcore all of a sudden.
[02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:13.630]  He's gotten real wild because he's somebody like Joe wants to navigate and balance things
[02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:17.070]  and be successful and wants to fix things peacefully.
[02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:23.790]  But see, when you start threatening people like that, their brains shift over and they
[02:41:23.790 --> 02:41:27.170]  go, well, I can't deal with these people.
[02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:34.350]  They're not going to be reasonable with me, skip the break.
[02:41:34.350 --> 02:41:38.070]  So I got to go to war with him.
[02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:42.190]  But that's why I try to start this show explaining to listeners, do you know what
[02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:44.050]  I'm doing?
[02:41:44.050 --> 02:41:47.470]  Like I'm risking my life here because I believe in you.
[02:41:47.470 --> 02:41:49.710]  Not because I'm a hero, not because I'm this great guy.
[02:41:49.710 --> 02:41:52.750]  I have a real problem being a slave.
[02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:57.550]  I have a real problem, I have a real problem if some superior political system came
[02:41:57.550 --> 02:42:00.950]  that did great things, I'd be like, well, I'll just join that.
[02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:02.950]  This is not superior.
[02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:13.350]  This is a pedophilic, greedy, selfish, demonic, horrible, stinking pile of crap.
[02:42:13.350 --> 02:42:22.230]  Sacrifice to be destroyed if that's what God wants in the service of defeating this.
[02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:29.550]  It is a honor, it is a pleasure.
[02:42:29.550 --> 02:42:32.750]  And I told the story five years ago, right before I got deplatformed because my dad
[02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:36.710]  is smart, the smartest people I've ever known, maybe the smartest.
[02:42:36.710 --> 02:42:40.990]  He never gets in my business, he never tells me what to do since I was about 16.
[02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:43.710]  He shows up at the house for breakfast on some Saturday morning, Sunday morning,
[02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:44.710]  I can't remember.
[02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:47.830]  I told the story last week.
[02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:52.910]  He comes in, he sits down at the table and I put some eggs and hash browns and
[02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:53.910]  on his plate.
[02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:56.510]  We sit back and drink coffee and he looks at me and he says, well, I know you know
[02:42:56.510 --> 02:43:01.230]  what you're doing, but I can see you're passing a line.
[02:43:01.230 --> 02:43:07.870]  And if you pass this line, it's going to be rough.
[02:43:07.870 --> 02:43:10.870]  And I said, dad, they're going to get everybody anyways, we got to do it.
[02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:13.790]  He said, I know you'd say that and I'm proud of you.
[02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:22.710]  And I'm really glad when you're doing this, but I love you and you need to get closer
[02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:27.630]  to God.
[02:43:27.630 --> 02:43:33.790]  And it's those moments in life that are timeless and you hold your daddy's hand
[02:43:33.790 --> 02:43:43.390]  on Saturday morning cry and you join your ancestors in being honorable.
[02:43:43.390 --> 02:43:53.910]  And I can tell you Tucker Carlson's real as it gets now, fully awake, fully pissed.
[02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:58.510]  And so are so many other people.
[02:43:58.510 --> 02:44:04.790]  And so we can't look at people like Vivek Ramaswami wanting to join us and say, oh,
[02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:06.290]  he's an infiltrator.
[02:44:06.290 --> 02:44:09.710]  You don't do the stuff he says and does.
[02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:11.350]  They're all coming after him now.
[02:44:11.350 --> 02:44:13.430]  No, he wants to join us.
[02:44:13.430 --> 02:44:15.390]  There's no debate about it.
[02:44:15.390 --> 02:44:19.070]  I'll be political and say, oh, well, he's probably good, but let's not trust him.
[02:44:19.070 --> 02:44:22.190]  He's on board, folks.
[02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:23.610]  He's not going to save us.
[02:44:23.610 --> 02:44:24.650]  God's going to save us.
[02:44:24.650 --> 02:44:29.610]  But the point is, is that this is the time when everybody's going to come over the side
[02:44:29.610 --> 02:44:36.330]  of our ship and we can't be here on a power trip at that point, rejecting people that
[02:44:36.330 --> 02:44:46.570]  are trying to flee the enemy because we were awake before them.
[02:44:46.570 --> 02:44:51.330]  But they could kill me today, not predicting they are, I'm just saying.
[02:44:51.330 --> 02:44:56.570]  I can feel the angel of death's wings flapping around me.
[02:44:56.570 --> 02:44:58.290]  But that's because you can all feel it.
[02:44:58.290 --> 02:45:03.650]  Nuclear war, global government, new world order, open demonic pedophilia, surgical surgeries
[02:45:03.650 --> 02:45:05.690]  of hundreds of thousands of children sterilizing them.
[02:45:05.690 --> 02:45:07.050]  I mean, we're in hell.
[02:45:07.470 --> 02:45:37.470]  But when you're in hell, you can look up through the smoke and see the mountaintop in God, and you can make the decision Tucker Carlson made, and the decision Joe Rogan has now made. Told me.
[02:45:37.470 --> 02:46:06.470]  To join your ancestors. To be honorable. To be strong. In the face of this deluge. In the face of this assault. In the face of this attack. It's the decision that matters. Not your body that will pass away. Not your wealth that means nothing. But who you are at your core. What you stand for.
[02:46:07.470 --> 02:46:21.470]  That's your essence. That's your soul. And these are the times that try men's souls. This life is a trial.
[02:46:21.900 --> 02:46:33.000]  And I just want to make it across the finish line with my nose. Because I want to be with
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:40.539]  God. And I want my heavenly body to be accepted in the spirit group of my ancestors. I've
[02:46:40.539 --> 02:46:44.900]  already seen them. I've already been there. I've already been there. I get to see my
[02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:49.100]  grandparents, folks. I get to literally go to the third heaven whenever God allows
[02:46:49.100 --> 02:46:54.859]  me to do it and just be there with all the beings of light, the angels. I'm there. I've
[02:46:54.859 --> 02:47:01.180]  already transcended the enemy, folks. It's so real. It's absolutely true. I cannot believe
[02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:08.440]  that I became within millimeters of joining Satan through pride when I was a teenager.
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:20.680]  But I was not recruited. I did not sign the enrollment. I was not conscripted. I signed
[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:28.640]  on with Jesus. Let's go to Carlos in Canada. Carlos, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:34.440]  Thank you, Alex. I appreciate you very much. I want to just bring back the people to
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:40.279]  the John F. Kennedy assassination, and how that relates to the possible attempt to
[02:47:40.279 --> 02:47:46.960]  assassinate President Trump. John F. Kennedy assassination was a revelation. And it
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:57.320]  saddens me to see Robert Kennedy Jr. talking about who was responsible. I don't
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:01.560]  think he pretty well has the information. For instance, I'll give you an example. The
[02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:06.480]  Cubans couldn't have done it because Cuba was monitored by Russia. Russia was in
[02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:11.400]  continuous contact since 1941 with Charles de Gaulle. Charles de Gaulle had his agents
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:16.760]  all over New Orleans and so on. He was going to be visiting Mexico. So he had it all set
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:21.760]  up. And the questions that are not asked today, which are relevant, is who financially
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:26.880]  would have benefited in either direction for the assassination of the President of the United
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:32.440]  States? What country would have dared to do so? And who would have the largest to lose
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:39.240]  in the event that he was done by some crazy nut job from a window in a building?
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:44.240]  So the point I'm making is that no one to this day, 60 years later, is looking
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:50.160]  at who was short selling the stock market at the time that it happened. But on November
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:58.039]  22nd, 1963, the stock market dropped from 12 o'clock noon or so. Just the biggest drop
[02:48:58.039 --> 02:49:03.480]  since the 1930s. Now, who benefited? And the point is, is this, although President
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:07.800]  Kennedy had a lot of people wishing to have him dead, okay, and just like with
[02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:11.680]  President Trump, there was a building of, you must hate him, you must hate him, you
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:16.900]  must hate him. Oh, he'd be better if he was dead. Days even before he was assassinated,
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:22.940]  you had the fact that the Vice President could have organized, oh, listen, I want to
[02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:23.940]  kill the President.
[02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:27.100]  Look, I got the deathbed confession, E. Howard Hunt, we all know who did it, it
[02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:32.580]  was the CIA. And they used some Cuban cutouts and mafia cutouts as fallback groups
[02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:36.900]  to blame. Charles Harrelson was there. It's all well known. It's like, everybody
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:38.500]  knows they killed Kennedy.
[02:49:38.500 --> 02:49:43.660]  Yes. And yet all the people concerned, like for instance, let's say Zapruder, Abraham
[02:49:43.660 --> 02:49:47.740]  Zapruder, you think that was just a guy taking a video? Well, do you ever research
[02:49:47.740 --> 02:49:52.020]  Abraham Zapruder, who he was, where he came from? Okay. What about the
[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:56.460]  people around that? Let's say a person that would shoot the President from a
[02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:59.980]  window, okay, when the President is going to be passing below, and then he's
[02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:04.180]  having a sandwich and a Coke, just like that, you know, and then later on runs
[02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:09.859]  away. Has anybody investigated who in fact, internationally, would have given
[02:50:10.060 --> 02:50:14.980]  go ahead to do so. Because internally, the United States didn't. I mean,
[02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:18.820]  imagine a country trying to kill the President of the United States, what
[02:50:18.859 --> 02:50:21.699]  they would never predict what the reaction of the United States would
[02:50:21.699 --> 02:50:25.980]  have been. And in any event, I don't for one second, invite anybody to
[02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:29.980]  think about it, from the perspective that, oh, yeah, the CIA sure,
[02:50:29.980 --> 02:50:34.699]  cover up, of course, yes. You know, all the individuals who mentioned in
[02:50:34.699 --> 02:50:38.580]  the United States could have been involved, like, like Hoover on the
[02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:42.100]  cover up, and so on. And President Johnson knew, and people knew that he
[02:50:42.100 --> 02:50:45.660]  was coming. That I understand. If you look even at the mafia, for
[02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:48.020]  instance, there have been agreements between the government and the
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:52.300]  mafia, the mafia would not kill politicians, judges, or imagine the
[02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:59.460]  President, and Carlos Marcello, and and Frank, you know, Costello, and
[02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:02.820]  all of these individuals that would have been associated with the mafia
[02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:04.980]  were very close to the Kennedy's. He already
[02:51:05.980 --> 02:51:10.140]  of the Kennedy's when he was a senator in a hotel in there. And you
[02:51:10.140 --> 02:51:13.100]  can find it out from Gino Rossi, for instance, who wrote it.
[02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:16.300]  I mean, the entire establishment wanted Kennedy dead. They all got
[02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:19.980]  together, they decided on it. And we basically know, I mean, I'm
[02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:23.300]  not mad at you. Bring this up, Carlos. I'm just saying, we kind
[02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:26.859]  of went over this ground. I mean, the shadow government killed
[02:51:26.859 --> 02:51:28.900]  Kennedy. There's no debate about it. I mean, that's,
[02:51:29.460 --> 02:51:33.220]  they wanted him killed. Because everything that and now about
[02:51:33.699 --> 02:51:37.699]  President Trump, everything that Kennedy did wasn't done by
[02:51:37.699 --> 02:51:40.580]  immediately after by the Vice President becoming president.
[02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:42.900]  That's right. Trump is trying to be president. He's being his
[02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:44.460]  own man. He's the one against the globalists. They want him
[02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:47.619]  dead. I appreciate your call. You're absolutely right. And
[02:51:47.619 --> 02:51:50.539]  now you look at DrudgeReport.com. And Drudge obviously is a
[02:51:50.539 --> 02:51:54.820]  globalist captured institution and organization now. And look at
[02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:58.900]  it, Tucker Assassination Fair. That's the message to Tucker.
[02:51:59.180 --> 02:52:02.500]  We're gonna kill your ass if you don't shut up.
[02:52:03.580 --> 02:52:07.340]  I'm not saying Drudge is making that threat. I'm saying that's
[02:52:07.340 --> 02:52:10.260]  what it is. Well, don't think Tucker doesn't already know
[02:52:10.260 --> 02:52:14.660]  that. So I predict Tucker gets more hardcore after this.
[02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:17.060]  I just have a little feeling.
[02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:23.740]  Because that's the good part about this. I don't wish Tucker
[02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:26.460]  any harm and I don't wish myself any harm. But you kill
[02:52:26.460 --> 02:52:29.779]  either one of us. It makes your problems 10 times worse. And
[02:52:29.779 --> 02:52:32.340]  you already know that, don't you? But you might not be able
[02:52:32.340 --> 02:52:36.220]  to help yourselves. Just know this will get you in the end.
[02:52:37.020 --> 02:52:38.140]  Oh, yes, we will.
[02:52:47.100 --> 02:52:50.140]  I would I would I would be killed for liberty for just
[02:52:50.140 --> 02:52:52.940]  one millisecond of heaven.
[02:52:52.940 --> 02:53:05.900]  And I've already been given an eternity. And you Satanists
[02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:08.220]  don't know because you've never tasted it. You have no
[02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:13.460]  idea. You have no idea. No idea. And you're fools. God's
[02:53:13.460 --> 02:53:16.619]  real. You know you serve Satan. You know Satan's real.
[02:53:16.619 --> 02:53:21.340]  You love the devil. You love cheating. You love the power
[02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:23.779]  you got. You know, I said I'd cover the ADL today and I
[02:53:23.779 --> 02:53:28.660]  didn't. But I'm coming in here at noon tomorrow live for
[02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:31.580]  at least two hours. We have our false flags and the
[02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:34.380]  globalist New World Order plan for tyranny. And
[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:37.619]  everybody can join me at noon central, 1pm Eastern, 11
[02:53:37.619 --> 02:53:42.580]  Mountain, 10 Pacific. And share that link. When you get
[02:53:42.580 --> 02:53:45.380]  excited, tens of millions tune in. When you don't, a million
[02:53:45.380 --> 02:53:49.260]  tune in. And we're going to really take the New World
[02:53:49.260 --> 02:53:55.619]  Order of the Woodshed and decode the whole enchilada.
[02:53:55.619 --> 02:53:59.080]  Tina in Maine, you're on the air. That's where Tucker is
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:02.940]  right now. Tina, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex,
[02:54:02.940 --> 02:54:05.580]  thank you for supporting and fighting us humans on this earth
[02:54:05.580 --> 02:54:09.220]  and the fight for our civilization. You literally will go
[02:54:09.220 --> 02:54:12.180]  down in the history books for being a disciple that you are.
[02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:15.100]  So God bless you and God bless your family for sharing
[02:54:15.100 --> 02:54:19.660]  you with us. God bless you. I'm calling. I got a few plugs I
[02:54:19.660 --> 02:54:23.500]  want to make on three of your amazing products. I'm 67
[02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:26.380]  years old. All my life I've been sick. I've been in and
[02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:29.980]  out of hospitals in oxygen tents due to breathing issues
[02:54:29.980 --> 02:54:33.740]  and immunity issues. And my dad being in the army for 20
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:36.859]  years, we lived abroad in Germany and lived in various US
[02:54:36.859 --> 02:54:39.820]  states. So whenever and wherever we moved, we had to
[02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:43.820]  take mandatory vaccinations. And just recently, Alex, I went
[02:54:43.820 --> 02:54:46.380]  into my vaccine records and discovered that I've been
[02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:51.100]  vaccinated 72 times. And so it's no wonder I've been sick
[02:54:51.100 --> 02:54:55.580]  all my life. In 2018, two months after I took the tetanus
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:57.980]  shot, I started having neurological issues. So I
[02:54:57.980 --> 02:55:01.340]  recently purchased your new product, Nerve Renew. And
[02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:04.060]  whenever I feel nerve pain starting to come on, I take
[02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:08.060]  one capsule and it totally calms down my nerve pain. The
[02:55:08.060 --> 02:55:11.020]  vitamin mineral fusion I've been doing for a year now.
[02:55:11.020 --> 02:55:15.180]  And what was happening was I couldn't even stay up all day.
[02:55:15.180 --> 02:55:18.220]  I'd be sleeping two to three hours during the day, but it
[02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:21.180]  gives me the sustained energy to get through the day.
[02:55:21.180 --> 02:55:25.420]  And lastly, your Survival Shield X3 is absolutely awesome.
[02:55:25.420 --> 02:55:28.699]  I've been taking that for over a year. And that product
[02:55:28.699 --> 02:55:32.380]  definitely changed the way I feel and how I feel daily. It
[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:35.820]  helps me with my breathing, my daily activities, the brown
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:38.939]  spots on my arms and my body have diminished. And the
[02:55:38.939 --> 02:55:42.140]  kicker, Alex, is that I give a few drops of that to my
[02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:45.580]  nine-year-old Chihuahua. And she literally has gained
[02:55:45.580 --> 02:55:48.619]  like five years of youth. She has like a puppy again.
[02:55:48.619 --> 02:55:51.820]  Oh, I mean iodine is the missing link so many places
[02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:54.939]  and most iodines are bound to other things. So people
[02:55:54.939 --> 02:55:57.420]  should get all the products at mfolworthstore.com.
[02:55:57.420 --> 02:56:02.460]  What else is on your mind? Well, lastly, my
[02:56:02.460 --> 02:56:05.660]  husband, he's been talking about this t-shirt that he
[02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:07.900]  thought it would be great if mfolworth could come out
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:10.939]  with. Everybody's talking about white supremacy. And
[02:56:10.939 --> 02:56:13.420]  unfortunately, nobody talks about who those white
[02:56:13.420 --> 02:56:17.820]  supremacists are. So he came up with this design on the
[02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:19.820]  front of the t-shirt. It would be like a German
[02:56:19.820 --> 02:56:23.580]  swastika and then a face in each one of those blocks.
[02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:26.060]  And one would be George Soros. The other would be
[02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:28.380]  Klaus Schwab. The other would be Bill Gates and then
[02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:31.820]  Fauci. And then on the back side, on the Health
[02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:35.500]  Ranger, Mike Adams' website, he had a picture of Biden's
[02:56:35.580 --> 02:56:38.699]  face with COVID spikes coming out and doing fear
[02:56:38.699 --> 02:56:41.660]  mongering and all. So if you had, if you actually
[02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:44.860]  said who the white supremacist people are, maybe it
[02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:48.619]  might help the Americans know that, you know, it's not
[02:56:48.619 --> 02:56:51.260]  just the white people. I mean, it is the white elite
[02:56:51.260 --> 02:56:52.860]  people that are the white supremacists. That are
[02:56:52.860 --> 02:56:55.820]  creating racial division. And I'm going to do a lot of
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:57.980]  time on this tomorrow. I did a lot of research today,
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:02.140]  but I'm out of time before the next guest host
[02:57:02.140 --> 02:57:04.300]  takes over, take a few more calls when we come back.
[02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:07.980]  But absolutely. I'm going to go do the deep dive on
[02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:10.779]  the secret intelligence agencies, the ADL, and how
[02:57:10.779 --> 02:57:12.699]  they're censoring the crimes they're committing and
[02:57:12.699 --> 02:57:16.140]  how to stop them tomorrow. 12 noon central time.
[02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:20.539]  Tina, thank you so much. Yeah. X3, it's basically
[02:57:20.539 --> 02:57:22.939]  sold out. Biomineral Fusion, basically sold out.
[02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:26.060]  Superfomal Vitality is amazing. It's all there.

[02:59:56.800 --> 03:00:13.679]  So now the corporate media has moved on to talking about Tucker getting killed.
[03:00:13.679 --> 03:00:14.679]  They are desperate.
[03:00:14.679 --> 03:00:23.840]  So the global is trying to block the sun out, they are trying to cut down trees, cuts oxygen.
[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:26.000]  What else is there?
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:28.000]  That's the new thing.
[03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.320]  The only thing they haven't banned is part of the carbon cycle.
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:31.960]  Bart wants to talk about that in Georgia.
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:32.960]  Bart, welcome.
[03:00:32.960 --> 03:00:33.960]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:33.960 --> 03:00:37.519]  I heard Carlos discussing the murder of John F. Kennedy.
[03:00:37.519 --> 03:00:41.279]  I want to discuss the murder of the world's ocean by pollution.
[03:00:41.279 --> 03:00:46.439]  They ignore, I mean, they push global warming, yet ignore all the plastic in the ocean.
[03:00:46.439 --> 03:00:52.119]  Oceanic plankton is bad because it makes 50% of our oxygen, Alex.
[03:00:52.119 --> 03:00:53.119]  Absolutely.
[03:00:53.119 --> 03:00:54.119]  We need to get rid of that oxygen.
[03:00:54.119 --> 03:00:55.119]  That's racist.
[03:00:55.240 --> 03:00:57.960]  Yeah, we need to get rid of that water.
[03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:02.840]  Like I said, when I was in the Philippines, Manila Bay and Subic Bay about four hours
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:06.160]  later were totally devoid of all fish.
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:07.560]  That was nine years ago.
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:09.679]  It's probably much worse now.
[03:01:09.679 --> 03:01:12.199]  No, you're right.
[03:01:12.199 --> 03:01:13.199]  We definitely overfished.
[03:01:13.199 --> 03:01:14.920]  The earth does have some issues.
[03:01:14.920 --> 03:01:20.160]  Well, I think it's more of, in the Philippines, it's more of a pollution issue because from
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:25.240]  all the chemicals and all the plastics, I believe this is part of killing the ocean
[03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:26.240]  by design.
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:29.439]  How many people are going to die if the ocean dies?
[03:01:29.439 --> 03:01:32.640]  Well, in Revelation, it says the ocean basically does die.
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:35.080]  What do you think is going to happen?
[03:01:35.080 --> 03:01:39.560]  They're killing it right now and not many people are doing anything about it.
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:41.359]  Well, that's the biggest thing.
[03:01:41.359 --> 03:01:45.119]  The whole globalist fake environmental movement saying carbon dioxide is bad and the sun
[03:01:45.119 --> 03:01:48.960]  is bad diverts from all the real issues we've got.
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:52.279]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:52.279 --> 03:01:55.400]  Got to save the ocean if we want to save humanity.
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:56.720]  What did you see when you were in the Philippines?
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:01:58.720]  You said it was just dead?
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:01:59.720]  Dead.
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:02.920]  I mean, I'm scared of sharks and I wasn't scared to swim out there because there's no
[03:02:02.920 --> 03:02:03.920]  sea, no sharks.
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:09.000]  There haven't been any sharks in that Subic Bay was where the old U.S. military base
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  was.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  God, since the 80s.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  I mean, there's no fish.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  Well, you know, they make a lot of the pharmaceuticals in the Philippines and a bunch of stuff.
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  Yeah.
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:20.000]  They just dump it in the water.
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  Yeah.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:26.439]  I do a lot of dynamite fishing and then they wonder why there's no more fish.
[03:02:26.439 --> 03:02:27.439]  Good points, brother.
[03:02:27.439 --> 03:02:28.439]  Appreciate your call.
[03:02:28.439 --> 03:02:29.439]  Abraham in Vegas.
[03:02:29.439 --> 03:02:30.439]  Go ahead.
[03:02:30.439 --> 03:02:31.439]  Yes, sir.
[03:02:31.439 --> 03:02:32.439]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:02:32.439 --> 03:02:33.439]  Welcome.
[03:02:33.439 --> 03:02:34.439]  Welcome, sir.
[03:02:34.439 --> 03:02:35.439]  I appreciate it.
[03:02:35.439 --> 03:02:37.320]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:42.720]  I've been a big fan for a long time and but I wanted to discuss something in regards
[03:02:42.720 --> 03:02:47.359]  to I'm not sure if you ever heard of a gentleman, sir, by the name of Mr. Philip Schneider.
[03:02:47.359 --> 03:02:54.179]  He used to work as a geologist under for the United States government back in 1979.
[03:02:54.179 --> 03:02:55.439]  And there was something called the Dulce Wars.
[03:02:55.439 --> 03:03:01.000]  And I know this is going to sound crazy, but back in 1979, he was he was in charge
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.599]  as far as building underground bunkers.
[03:03:02.599 --> 03:03:07.279]  As far as geologists and engineers involved in the construction of underground military
[03:03:07.279 --> 03:03:08.279]  bases known as dumps.
[03:03:08.279 --> 03:03:09.279]  No, no.
[03:03:09.279 --> 03:03:10.279]  I interviewed him before he died.
[03:03:10.279 --> 03:03:12.039]  I remember like 20 some years ago.
[03:03:12.039 --> 03:03:13.439]  Oh, you remember this?
[03:03:13.439 --> 03:03:14.439]  Oh, okay.
[03:03:14.439 --> 03:03:15.439]  Okay, great.
[03:03:15.439 --> 03:03:17.359]  And obviously, you know, the history in regards to this gentleman and talking about
[03:03:17.359 --> 03:03:18.359]  the New World Order.
[03:03:18.359 --> 03:03:21.679]  Yeah, I mean, it's I don't know if he's accurate about underground bases and alien
[03:03:21.679 --> 03:03:22.679]  wars.
[03:03:22.679 --> 03:03:23.679]  I don't know.
[03:03:23.679 --> 03:03:24.679]  Okay, gotcha.
[03:03:24.679 --> 03:03:25.679]  Gotcha.
[03:03:25.679 --> 03:03:29.359]  It's just very eerie that the information that he that he brought about and talk about the
[03:03:29.359 --> 03:03:35.199]  the black budget projects and the trillion dollars that has that was that's been since
[03:03:35.199 --> 03:03:37.279]  that time.
[03:03:37.279 --> 03:03:40.279]  But the thing is that he discussed in regards to the fact that the plan was and again,
[03:03:40.279 --> 03:03:44.039]  I know it sounds crazy, but as far as I try to take our second amendment rights in order
[03:03:44.039 --> 03:03:49.519]  to defend ourselves, that would happen right around 2028 or 2029.
[03:03:49.519 --> 03:03:53.240]  And it just sort of coordinates with what's happening right now in this world.
[03:03:53.240 --> 03:03:57.560]  So well, I interviewed him right before he died a couple years a year after I had
[03:03:57.560 --> 03:03:58.560]  him on.
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:03:59.560]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:00.560]  I just call it what I can prove.
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:04.240]  And I mean, they're cutting children's genitals off their world governments here.
[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:06.240]  They're starting war with Russia.
[03:04:06.279 --> 03:04:11.000]  I mean, we are, you know, they've indicted the presidential front runner.
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:14.359]  I mean, that's just I got so much stuff I can prove that I can't even hardly even
[03:04:14.359 --> 03:04:15.759]  think about all the stuff I can prove.
[03:04:15.759 --> 03:04:16.759]  But I don't know.
[03:04:16.759 --> 03:04:17.759]  Well, that's true.
[03:04:17.759 --> 03:04:18.759]  I've never seen an alien.
[03:04:18.759 --> 03:04:19.759]  I don't know.
[03:04:19.759 --> 03:04:20.759]  Gotcha.
[03:04:20.759 --> 03:04:21.759]  Gotcha.
[03:04:21.759 --> 03:04:22.759]  Well, that's interesting.
[03:04:22.759 --> 03:04:23.759]  You did an interview.
[03:04:23.759 --> 03:04:24.759]  I didn't know that.
[03:04:24.759 --> 03:04:25.759]  I apologize.
[03:04:25.759 --> 03:04:27.759]  You're not supposed to know all that.
[03:04:27.759 --> 03:04:34.119]  I've been on there 29 years and I'd say only I'd only say about 20 years is really
[03:04:34.119 --> 03:04:35.119]  online.
[03:04:35.119 --> 03:04:36.119]  It's part of it.
[03:04:36.119 --> 03:04:39.000]  And before that, very little is up there and we don't really have copies of it.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.960]  So, you know, that's a problem.
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:42.800]  But people are finding it here and there.
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:43.800]  It's going everywhere.
[03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:44.800]  All right, brother.
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:45.800]  Thank you.
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:46.800]  Abraham.
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:48.759]  I can't get to will and I can't get to leave it.
[03:04:48.759 --> 03:04:49.759]  I'll call you tomorrow.
[03:04:49.759 --> 03:04:50.759]  They're in the noon show.

[03:06:06.519 --> 03:06:11.960]  of Jay's analysis I'm in my makeshift studio so that's why you see the corny green
[03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:18.420]  screen behind me so when we get this fixed it'll be a better background I promise today
[03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:21.660]  I want to talk about a book that we haven't talked about yet in the fourth hour I know
[03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:27.380]  Alex has mentioned it many times over the years and it's an it's a key text because it was so
[03:06:27.380 --> 03:06:33.779]  accurate in what it said and it was so lambasted and it was derided at the time in the early 90s
[03:06:33.779 --> 03:06:40.859]  and that's the 1992 book the committee of 300 the conspirators hierarchy by dr. John Coleman
[03:06:40.859 --> 03:06:46.859]  the former British intelligence agent who eventually found out about this what we could call
[03:06:46.859 --> 03:06:52.099]  anglo-american establishment elite the secret government the shadow government that runs the
[03:06:52.099 --> 03:06:56.980]  atlantis establishment every time I say that people think I'm talking about Atlantis no it
[03:06:56.980 --> 03:07:03.039]  just means the Western elite doesn't mean Atlantis it means the Atlantic and the elite
[03:07:03.039 --> 03:07:09.779]  in relationship to the Atlantic as opposed to the Eurasian continent and so forth and this
[03:07:09.779 --> 03:07:13.580]  book was written right around the time that things were really heating up in regard to
[03:07:13.740 --> 03:07:23.740]  Bush or senior Gulf the Gulf storm all that Iraqi freedom and the subsequent Iraqi false
[03:07:23.740 --> 03:07:31.460]  flags and invasions and he predicted that the false left-right would be used in the future
[03:07:31.460 --> 03:07:37.939]  as a way to corral the citizens into losing their liberties and so it was very accurate very
[03:07:37.939 --> 03:07:45.539]  very prophetic even you could say and that's why I think or the skeptics for dr. Coleman's
[03:07:45.539 --> 03:07:49.900]  work back in the day back in the I remember in the in the 90s and in the 2000s when I was
[03:07:49.900 --> 03:07:53.140]  first getting into this kind of literature I would see people saying oh you can't trust his
[03:07:53.140 --> 03:07:58.939]  stuff he's just some some guy it's all just made up and one reason they said that is that
[03:07:58.939 --> 03:08:04.500]  he doesn't provide a lot of sources now that could be because at that time a lot of
[03:08:04.500 --> 03:08:09.900]  writers you know typically if you go the further you go back in history the less you find footnotes
[03:08:09.900 --> 03:08:15.019]  if you go back to the early 1900s people didn't really footnote they might write they
[03:08:15.019 --> 03:08:18.099]  might mention things in bibliographies or something like that but it's kind of assumed
[03:08:18.099 --> 03:08:23.099]  that if you were in academia that you were going to be forthright you're gonna tell the
[03:08:23.099 --> 03:08:26.420]  truth now it does list a lot of texts in the back but he doesn't have a lot of
[03:08:26.420 --> 03:08:29.500]  footnotes for a lot of the claims but he also says that you know a lot of the stuff I
[03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:35.660]  got firsthand from being in British intelligence and so there's not going to be an easy document
[03:08:35.660 --> 03:08:40.820]  that I can publicly reference everybody to so a lot of people kind of had to just take him at
[03:08:40.820 --> 03:08:47.060]  his word maybe not on everything but at least in some of the claims in the book and that's not
[03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:52.340]  surprising either given the fact that you know that there's a strict laws in the UK that pertain
[03:08:52.340 --> 03:08:57.859]  to the National Secrets Act officials you see me official Secrets Act so people in these
[03:08:57.859 --> 03:09:03.300]  situations could be prosecuted if they talked about anything that they actually knew about so
[03:09:03.300 --> 03:09:07.340]  a lot of British writers would write these things into fiction well dr. Coleman wrote the
[03:09:07.340 --> 03:09:12.580]  conspirators hierarchy in 1992 and at that time he was explaining what we would see in
[03:09:12.580 --> 03:09:17.900]  the coming decades and some of these predictions are so on point and accurate that I think the
[03:09:17.900 --> 03:09:23.539]  book is absolutely vindicated in fact he lists some of the things to expect early on in the
[03:09:23.539 --> 03:09:29.300]  context and he says that here is what the one-world government plans he says that they
[03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:35.460]  want to bring in a unified Church a new world religion and a unified monetary system it will
[03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:41.140]  be under the direction of a single world government and it will do things like combine
[03:09:41.140 --> 03:09:45.939]  various religions into one and so the actions that we see with Pope Francis and the new Abu
[03:09:45.939 --> 03:09:50.820]  Dhabi Faith Center which combines the three monolithic religions into a new religion
[03:09:51.619 --> 03:09:56.500]  this kind of stuff these are all manifestations of the things that were being written about
[03:09:56.500 --> 03:10:02.660]  decades ago by dr. Coleman he says that this will entail in part the destruction of all
[03:10:02.660 --> 03:10:08.699]  national identity and national culture and pride so you can't have a nation-state because that's
[03:10:08.699 --> 03:10:13.939]  one of the firewalls that's in the way of globalization the utter destruction of all
[03:10:13.939 --> 03:10:20.660]  traditional religions especially Christianity has to be engaged in and this is his list of the
[03:10:21.539 --> 03:10:26.500]  that they're going to try to do early on in the text every person will be controlled through
[03:10:26.500 --> 03:10:31.060]  what Brzezinski calls technotronics and we've covered Brzezinski's between two ages many
[03:10:31.060 --> 03:10:35.939]  times I don't have to rehearse that that was written in the early 70s and that's what got
[03:10:35.939 --> 03:10:42.099]  Brzezinski recruited into working for Kissinger and Rockefeller he ran after that the trilateral
[03:10:42.099 --> 03:10:46.580]  commission that was set up just for him the next stage that they want to engage in is what
[03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:54.500]  is called zero growth society or zpg zero population growth and not just population growth
[03:10:54.500 --> 03:11:00.179]  but zero growth in every other area in terms of the economy so you can't have you're not
[03:11:00.179 --> 03:11:04.980]  going to have your own business your own means of transaction you're not going to have
[03:11:06.019 --> 03:11:10.420]  your own capital that you're able to save up that you can bequeath to your children
[03:11:10.420 --> 03:11:15.140]  inheritance all these kinds of things and again you're absolutely correct that these line up with
[03:11:15.140 --> 03:11:21.619]  Marx's planks of the communist manifesto it's not ultimately Marxist that run all this as Dr.
[03:11:21.619 --> 03:11:26.900]  Coleman accurately points out it's the committee of 300 who are above Marxism who are actually
[03:11:26.900 --> 03:11:34.019]  monopoly capitalists and international usury based corporate banking elites that run this
[03:11:34.019 --> 03:11:38.740]  whole system he says that and that's what the federal reserve right is that system that usury
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:43.539]  based fiat system the debt based system that I'm talking about there will be an end to all
[03:11:43.539 --> 03:11:49.699]  industrialization and production as part of the zero population growth slash zero growth society so
[03:11:49.699 --> 03:11:54.340]  zero zpg doesn't just mean people that's the ultimate goal getting the numbers down get the
[03:11:54.340 --> 03:12:00.340]  numbers down but it also means not having any economic growth austerity banking elite
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:06.900]  corporate elite technocratic elite putting in the means to destroy economic progress and
[03:12:06.900 --> 03:12:11.300]  destruction so you have to understand that it's not just incompetent people in Washington
[03:12:11.380 --> 03:12:16.500]  it's an actual strategized plan and you know when we were we were covering Dr. Coleman's
[03:12:17.140 --> 03:12:22.179]  book that he has for example on Tavistock he focused on how Tavistock was one of the leading
[03:12:22.179 --> 03:12:27.859]  psychological warfare think tanks pushing a lot of this stuff and he wrote back then
[03:12:27.859 --> 03:12:32.340]  around the late 90s early 2000s when he wrote his Tavistock book that they would push
[03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:36.900]  the new status of sexuality and it would be geared towards children so again he was absolutely
[03:12:36.980 --> 03:12:43.380]  100% correct in that book that the trans agenda would be pushed as the next phase after the
[03:12:44.580 --> 03:12:50.980]  rainbow agenda and you have to understand that they're studying things I just got this one
[03:12:50.980 --> 03:12:54.500]  we know as you guys know we've lectured through Dr. Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope
[03:12:54.500 --> 03:12:58.820]  but there's other texts not just Anglo-American establishment Dr. Quigley also wrote Evolution
[03:12:58.820 --> 03:13:03.779]  of Civilizations which I just got there's a lot of similar information in that book as well
[03:13:04.580 --> 03:13:10.099]  that shows that they study civilizations H.G. Wells, Twain B, all of these people did
[03:13:10.660 --> 03:13:16.900]  civilizational studies for Wellington House for British Intelligence for Tavistock and that's
[03:13:16.900 --> 03:13:21.779]  because we're not under the British Empire we're under the same elite that ran the British
[03:13:21.779 --> 03:13:27.300]  Empire the eastern seaboard elite that aligned themselves with the real elite that run the
[03:13:27.300 --> 03:13:32.980]  British Empire when it failed they just took over the engine of America that's why America
[03:13:32.980 --> 03:13:38.099]  engages in all these foreign wars and escapades pushes all this stuff across the globe is because
[03:13:38.099 --> 03:13:46.179]  it serves the agenda of these people this is the actual elite international government
[03:13:46.900 --> 03:13:53.300]  and it's made up of a whole host of people and countries in fact he calls them the Olympians
[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:59.300]  because there's a comparison to the wise men or the gods of Olympus or the ancient sages or
[03:13:59.300 --> 03:14:05.140]  Plato's council of the night which is in Plato's laws that's a secret shadow government that Plato
[03:14:05.140 --> 03:14:09.539]  came up with in his later writings and so that's what they're called the Olympians is that
[03:14:09.539 --> 03:14:14.580]  from their perspective they correspond to the gods and to these the people who determine
[03:14:14.580 --> 03:14:19.539]  history and are not viewers of history they're the ones that make history from their perspective
[03:14:19.539 --> 03:14:26.420]  the next strategies that would come into play would be the intentional legalization of
[03:14:26.420 --> 03:14:32.740]  drugs and all forms of sexuality and pornography and that's done as a weapon and it's a means to
[03:14:32.740 --> 03:14:37.460]  control and debase society so you understand it's it's an intentional strategy of warfare
[03:14:37.460 --> 03:14:44.340]  it's not just incompetency it's not just people who are degenerate who are in positions
[03:14:44.340 --> 03:14:48.259]  of power certainly at the government strata the government level there's a lot of incompetent
[03:14:48.259 --> 03:14:53.220]  stupid people but they're not the ones calling the shots these people are the Anglo-American
[03:14:53.220 --> 03:14:59.300]  establishment the Atlantis elite that power block is calling the shots and they intentionally push
[03:14:59.300 --> 03:15:02.580]  these things through all these think tanks foundations NGOs and so forth
[03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:09.380]  he goes on to say that large cities eventually would be uh
[03:15:09.380 --> 03:15:14.179]  compacted but there would also be depopulation measures put into place so how that goes about
[03:15:14.179 --> 03:15:16.980]  we don't exactly know we don't know what they're going to do when they try to move us into
[03:15:16.980 --> 03:15:21.060]  these smart cities but we know that the smart cities are absolutely part of this planned technocratic
[03:15:21.060 --> 03:15:26.820]  agenda to push everybody into out of the rural places and into these giant nightmare
[03:15:26.820 --> 03:15:32.580]  dystopian cities like Blade Runner 2049 right and so once that happens the scenario the stage
[03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:37.859]  is set for whatever means they want to try to use might be it might be offers of universal
[03:15:37.859 --> 03:15:42.420]  basic income for sterilization it might be bio weapons it could be anything we don't know
[03:15:42.420 --> 03:15:47.220]  but that's definitely part of this long-term plan to get everybody into mega cities and smart
[03:15:47.220 --> 03:15:51.699]  cities this is the alex jones from your guest host jay dark days nelson's covering dr john
[03:15:51.699 --> 03:15:57.779]  colman's committee 300 tech one of these classics you wanted to plug rainforest do

[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:19.640]  so you're listening to jay dyer guest host and we are going through the classic text
[03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:25.320]  from dr john coleman that predicted so many things that are now coming true he wrote this
[03:20:25.320 --> 03:20:31.359]  book in 1992 and he said look here is the new world order plan here is their agenda
[03:20:31.359 --> 03:20:37.439]  and pretty much everything that he wrote about in in the book he lists about 21 points
[03:20:38.320 --> 03:20:43.519]  that they have as part of their agenda to get done in the next coming decades most of these have
[03:20:43.519 --> 03:20:49.039]  been achieved and completed and a lot of the citations that he does give when he does cite
[03:20:49.039 --> 03:20:54.080]  things are books that we've covered that we've lectured through he cites a lot of books like
[03:20:54.080 --> 03:21:00.080]  changing images of man the aquarium conspiracy by maryland ferguson tavistock institute books
[03:21:00.080 --> 03:21:05.679]  and text pushing a lot of the the the agendas the club of rome agenda for austerity the first global
[03:21:05.679 --> 03:21:10.800]  revolution on and on and on many of those texts are things that we've discussed even to the point
[03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:15.840]  of getting really sophisticated in how british intelligence utilizes things like the muslim
[03:21:15.840 --> 03:21:20.880]  brotherhood and radical islamic sex how that's been a tool of the british empire for control
[03:21:21.599 --> 03:21:29.279]  all the way back to the time of uh kim phillby and kim phillby senior uh saint saint john hunt
[03:21:29.279 --> 03:21:35.759]  or excuse me not saint john uh phillby senior and and uh te lawrence excuse me uh saint john
[03:21:35.759 --> 03:21:41.119]  hunt is that relates to jfk assassination so but that's covered in the text by um
[03:21:41.759 --> 03:21:48.960]  intelligence writer steven doral when he gets into a lot of the inside covert operations
[03:21:48.960 --> 03:21:53.679]  this is an academic text as well this is not a conspiracy text about the history of british
[03:21:53.679 --> 03:21:58.800]  intelligence and their machinations and so what he writes in that book again a mainline text
[03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:03.840]  actually lines up with a lot of what dr colman goes into now that's a mainline text so he doesn't
[03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:08.720]  go into every single plan of the future but he does mention mk ultra he does mention
[03:22:08.720 --> 03:22:14.000]  biowarfare research at port and down he does mention uh things like bilderberg group
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:17.519]  anglo-american establishment royal and super international affairs as the very things in
[03:22:17.519 --> 03:22:21.920]  the background of british intelligence and that's exactly what we've seen in many other
[03:22:21.920 --> 03:22:27.439]  texts that we've lectured through here like the yoan ratu text on the milner fabian circle
[03:22:27.439 --> 03:22:30.720]  so understand all that stuff that i was talking about in the past that's not disconnected these
[03:22:30.720 --> 03:22:35.679]  aren't a million different groups they're all part of the same structure and it's the same
[03:22:35.679 --> 03:22:42.640]  people that go to the same groups steering committees meetings etcetera it's that simple
[03:22:42.640 --> 03:22:48.960]  cfr same people making up that structure so if you're getting confused or you think that you're
[03:22:48.960 --> 03:22:53.279]  getting lost in the weeds when you you hear me lecturing through books like this about by
[03:22:53.279 --> 03:22:58.240]  patrick wood about trilateral commission that's just another higher level of cfr people that
[03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:02.320]  that brazinski ran it's all the same people just different groups and meetings
[03:23:02.880 --> 03:23:06.960]  and probably a lot of that is intended to just confuse the public right i mean it's like
[03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:10.560]  well i can't keep up with all these groups and so are you saying it's the bilderbergs
[03:23:10.560 --> 03:23:14.320]  are running are you saying it's the club of rome are you saying it's this other group
[03:23:14.320 --> 03:23:20.400]  no it's all of these together and the high level people right in these groups
[03:23:20.800 --> 03:23:29.000]  the 300 top most important powerful people are the ones that are calling the shots ballers
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:35.960]  and shot callers okay so the real shot callers people like Kissinger and Brzezinski now those
[03:23:35.960 --> 03:23:41.240]  are the brains right they're not the most wealthy people per se but the really wealthy
[03:23:41.240 --> 03:23:46.640]  people will ask people like Kissinger and Brzezinski hey how do we get this done what do we do
[03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:54.400]  to move this technocratic agenda forward and that's why for example Kissinger and the CIA and Harvard
[03:23:54.400 --> 03:24:01.359]  set up the project that would create the Davos group out of Bilderberg and then they put Klaus
[03:24:01.359 --> 03:24:07.039]  in that position they so see you see a pattern here of Kissinger spots Brzezinski puts him in
[03:24:07.039 --> 03:24:13.800]  trilateral role Kissinger spots Klaus puts him in Bilderberg and Davos role that's simple
[03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:19.320]  this isn't even conspiracy this is reality anybody can go and verify and see if that's the case
[03:24:20.359 --> 03:24:25.880]  and so when Dr. Coleman was writing about these plans the fact that all of these are spot on
[03:24:25.880 --> 03:24:31.400]  I would say 90% of what he wrote about in that book has come to pass and so we can say this
[03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:38.279]  is almost certainly correct he was legit because I think if somebody writes a book and they're
[03:24:38.279 --> 03:24:42.199]  saying here's what the plan is and here's what they're going to do there's tons of you know
[03:24:42.199 --> 03:24:46.840]  fringe wackos out there to put books out and most of that stuff doesn't ever happen planet x is
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:51.240]  coming in there's a pole shift and it's next year and if you've been in alternative media
[03:24:51.240 --> 03:24:55.320]  you've been hearing that for 20-30 years and most of the time nothing ever comes out of that
[03:24:55.320 --> 03:24:59.720]  stuff but when you see a book like this saying hey I'm former British intelligence you
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:03.880]  might think okay well I'll be a skeptic maybe you were maybe you weren't the proof is in the
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:08.679]  pudding if what he wrote about has come true and a lot of these are really shocking things
[03:25:08.679 --> 03:25:14.599]  he's not just saying that we're gonna have a worse future things are getting bad no it's
[03:25:14.599 --> 03:25:17.880]  very specific for example he says that you will see
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:28.039]  true scientific developments will be suppressed and false scientific theories will be pushed I
[03:25:28.039 --> 03:25:31.960]  think we've seen that quite a bit and what specifically we're talking about well he goes on
[03:25:31.960 --> 03:25:36.759]  to say the global 2000 report that was put out and this this relates to things like the
[03:25:36.759 --> 03:25:42.359]  Rio Summit that Alex talks about signing on to Kyoto protocols back in the day where they're
[03:25:42.359 --> 03:25:46.679]  trying to really push all the green agenda back in the 90s he says that that will be
[03:25:46.679 --> 03:25:53.480]  pushed in the future under the guise of fake science climate etc and that the goal for
[03:25:53.480 --> 03:26:01.640]  pushing all of that is to get in place austerity measures that will kill at least they say their
[03:26:01.640 --> 03:26:07.080]  target goal is at least three billion useless eaters in the third world so what you heard Alex
[03:26:07.080 --> 03:26:13.880]  always saying about the lockdowns killing millions of people that is part of this now that's not the
[03:26:13.880 --> 03:26:19.400]  they didn't achieve everything there but the goal of these Malthusians is to eventually get to
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:24.119]  bringing it down to three billion or knocking down three billion then knocking it down to eventually
[03:26:24.119 --> 03:26:29.240]  just one billion people and then lower from there Greg Reese just did a report on that where
[03:26:29.240 --> 03:26:34.039]  you saw some of these older climate green agenda people saying that very thing I just watched the
[03:26:34.039 --> 03:26:39.800]  60 minutes report from I think it was pretty recent actually and they were interviewing a bunch
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:45.240]  of today's Malthusians including Paul Ehrlich right Paul Ehrlich saying it might have been
[03:26:45.240 --> 03:26:49.560]  an older interview I don't remember but I just recently watched this from 60 minutes you can
[03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:57.400]  find it on it's YouTube's presentation of World Wildlife Federation in 60 minutes and Paul Ehrlich
[03:26:57.400 --> 03:27:01.560]  and they're literally just saying that we're not going to survive unless we get rid of everybody
[03:27:02.679 --> 03:27:06.840]  so this has not gone away it didn't go away because in the 90s they didn't get
[03:27:06.840 --> 03:27:10.599]  everything through with the Rio summit and all that they just keep pushing it it's back
[03:27:11.400 --> 03:27:16.359]  and the COVID stuff as everybody now knows ties into that because they were able to see
[03:27:16.359 --> 03:27:22.359]  what happened to the economy when they shut everything down what happened to how people
[03:27:22.359 --> 03:27:28.840]  interacted social organization and it fits perfectly into what they wanted now they may
[03:27:28.840 --> 03:27:33.080]  not have got everything that they wanted in that event but that is a test that can tell them
[03:27:33.080 --> 03:27:37.240]  what to do in the next event and it's very likely that they're going to push a new version
[03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:43.880]  of that as we've seen Alex broke in the last couple weeks the TSA whistleblower so you know
[03:27:43.880 --> 03:27:49.080]  what do they say climate lockdowns climate lockdowns and so if there's a real lockdown beyond
[03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:54.840]  what we saw last on a real pandemic or something like that it'll be all the more justified to bring
[03:27:54.840 --> 03:28:00.519]  in these measures which actually will be about mass depopulation exactly how they'll do that
[03:28:00.519 --> 03:28:07.880]  i don't know but according to Dr Coleman's argumentation he says that when they accepted
[03:28:07.880 --> 03:28:12.599]  a lot of this Malthusian stuff under Carter president and Nixon and Carter presidential
[03:28:12.599 --> 03:28:18.519]  memorandum 200 with Kissinger and depopulation he argues that the real stated goal was
[03:28:18.599 --> 03:28:24.599]  by 2050 to reduce the American population to under 100 million so that's just for the US
[03:28:24.599 --> 03:28:30.199]  that's not for another world the other countries i'm sure it's also massive as well culture war
[03:28:30.199 --> 03:28:35.000]  is crucial as well as he moves on to talk about the pushing of satanic pop music
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:41.160]  satanic culture we've seen nothing but a tenfold explosion of that since the 1990s
[03:28:41.160 --> 03:28:46.039]  gangster rap in the 90s it was tame compared to what we see in pop culture nowadays
[03:28:46.039 --> 03:28:51.160]  pretty it's pretty wild um but when we come back we'll get even deeper into Dr John Coleman
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:55.160]  the committee of 300 on the Alex Jones show under guest host Jay Dyer

[03:33:05.800 --> 03:33:14.759]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Nye of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:14.759 --> 03:33:22.080]  We're working our way through the infamous famous text that was much maligned and criticized
[03:33:22.080 --> 03:33:27.720]  and kind of neglected for many years, Dr. John Coleman's conspiracy hierarchy story
[03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:34.199]  of the Committee of 300. And we're walking through his 21-point plan as to what the
[03:33:34.199 --> 03:33:42.199]  global elite had planned from the 1990s and before up into our day and up to 2050. So remember,
[03:33:42.199 --> 03:33:46.920]  there's actuaries and plans on the basis of various decades as to what they want to
[03:33:46.920 --> 03:33:55.160]  do by 2030, 2040, 2050. Remember that the World Economic Forum put out in 2016 their
[03:33:55.160 --> 03:34:01.519]  Things to Expect by 2030 video, and it included the possibility of the discovery
[03:34:01.519 --> 03:34:08.840]  of alien life. It included the demoralization and destabilization of Western civilization
[03:34:08.840 --> 03:34:14.240]  in the United States as no longer a superpower. You will eat bugs and not meat. You will have
[03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:21.960]  mass population displacement, demographic warfare. You will have drones delivering
[03:34:21.960 --> 03:34:25.960]  everything to your door and you won't go shop anymore and you will own nothing and
[03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:29.080]  you will be happy. That was the first point in that 2030. So that's what they
[03:34:29.080 --> 03:34:34.199]  have planned, the circular economy. Look up the lectures of Ida Alkin. This is just
[03:34:34.199 --> 03:34:39.199]  technocratic communism under a different name. And everybody's going to fall for
[03:34:39.199 --> 03:34:42.679]  it because they think they're going to get a universal basic income. They're going
[03:34:42.679 --> 03:34:47.679]  to get to live free and they're going to have a kumpad and they can just lay there
[03:34:47.679 --> 03:34:51.779]  and have sex with dragons and Mark Zuckerberg all day long. That's what they think they're
[03:34:51.779 --> 03:34:57.759]  going to get. But you're not going to get that. It's all a trap. And the various cities
[03:34:57.759 --> 03:35:02.960]  that are signing on to the smart cities initiative that they're now pushing. I think
[03:35:02.960 --> 03:35:07.720]  there's something like 15 cities that want to move in this direction. This is all being
[03:35:07.720 --> 03:35:13.119]  sold to you under the guise of ease and simplicity and security, right? You're going
[03:35:13.119 --> 03:35:18.279]  to be secure. Everything can be surveilled. Everything will be within walking distance.
[03:35:18.279 --> 03:35:23.400]  It's going to be so easy. That's why other cities were talking about a target goal.
[03:35:23.800 --> 03:35:31.199]  I think Glenn Beck covered this of basically getting rid of cars, right? Banning meat and
[03:35:31.199 --> 03:35:36.039]  getting rid of cars. Now, this wasn't a law that they passed. And so when the fact
[03:35:36.039 --> 03:35:40.480]  checkers were trying to quote fact check this, they were debunking something that
[03:35:40.480 --> 03:35:45.160]  wasn't even being claimed. These were just planned World Economic Forum goals that
[03:35:45.160 --> 03:35:50.279]  certain blue cities want to shoot for. So there you have it right there that these
[03:35:50.320 --> 03:35:56.800]  blue cities are saying we want to ban cars and we want to ban meat. At least by 2030,
[03:35:56.800 --> 03:36:02.400]  2040. That's what they actually said. Future goals, future plans. So you understand,
[03:36:02.400 --> 03:36:06.759]  even if you don't think any of this stuff is real, or you are a skeptic or whatever,
[03:36:06.759 --> 03:36:15.400]  they openly say this is what we want to do by those decades. And you read books like this,
[03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:21.080]  Dr. John Coleman's text. They said a lot more than that many, many years ago. So this is
[03:36:21.080 --> 03:36:26.720]  absolutely a real plan. We just talked about the drastic reduction in population that they want
[03:36:26.720 --> 03:36:34.840]  to do. We talked about the promotion lastly of radical occult and satanic pop culture as
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:39.840]  part of the plan. Doesn't mean everybody in the committee of 300 openly worships Satan.
[03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:43.800]  Some of them probably do. I think many of them probably do. But they don't have to
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:51.439]  because from the vantage point of the technocrat, degenerate pop culture is a weapon. You see that
[03:36:51.439 --> 03:36:59.119]  the passions, base desires, these things can be weaponized to control and debase a society. So
[03:36:59.119 --> 03:37:05.720]  they're useful as forms of warfare, siege and strategy. The youth of the land, he says,
[03:37:05.720 --> 03:37:11.640]  will be encouraged by means of pop music, drugs to rebel. But this rebellion is not a real
[03:37:11.679 --> 03:37:17.640]  rebellion. It's actually intended to destroy the family. And that's a stated plan. Now,
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.279]  could you imagine what John Coleman would have thought if he were able to,
[03:37:23.279 --> 03:37:29.480]  in 2023, see what Tavistock would be pushing across the world to all of the children?
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:37.080]  I mean, even further than what he expected. I don't know that even he expected that they
[03:37:37.080 --> 03:37:44.400]  would get to push globally the trans view. But he says that if you read books like The
[03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:48.120]  Aquarian Conspiracy, which he believes, as many others believe, was not actually written
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:52.240]  by Marilynne Ferguson, but was actually written by Willis Harman, who wrote Changing
[03:37:52.240 --> 03:37:57.680]  Images of Man, then you can see how this all fits into a corporate push. Because
[03:37:57.680 --> 03:38:03.260]  in Marilynne Ferguson's book, she says that the push for this new Aquarian age is actually
[03:38:03.260 --> 03:38:09.000]  going to be pushed by the corporations. The corporate HR departments that will eventually
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:14.060]  be run by women, and then the CEOs, which will eventually be women, it'll be much easier
[03:38:14.060 --> 03:38:23.040]  to get them to push this circular economy agenda and all of this as a package deal
[03:38:23.040 --> 03:38:27.080]  when the feminist feminocracy is in place. So you understand they had to get the feminocracy
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:29.240]  in place first before this could happen.
[03:38:29.400 --> 03:38:59.400]  He says next that the management of crises will be key. So when there's a crisis there will have to be things in place. And he says that FEMA is one of these early versions of this. But he says that other agencies will come along. Of course, we've seen the TSA and other agencies come about since 1980 with FEMA and since Dr. John Coleman writing this book. We've seen all kinds of secret government agencies. We've seen the military have secret agents that they recruited.
[03:38:59.400 --> 03:39:29.400]  Thousands of the famous thing that came out about the Army a few years ago. The U.S. military has agents everywhere and on and on. So there's this giant bureaucracy of spies and agents everywhere. And they play a role in not just surveilling, but eventually managing crises. And crisis management never let a good crisis go to waste is one of the key elements of the elite. It's a Hegelian process control mechanism where you don't you not only create the problem.
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:59.400]  You are already there with the solution to the problem that you either steered or caused to bring about the end results that you wanted. More control, loss of civil liberties. And that's what all these operations like 9-11, OKC, those all led to the future control mechanisms that we now have.
[03:39:59.400 --> 03:40:27.400]  We're going to fix these counterculture to see the beginning of the studies of those things, how to engineer music and things like the counterculture. And he says that will eventually result in the promulgation of mass cult beliefs. And when I see people who believe that they're animals and I see furries and these kinds of weirdos, those are just manifestations of this very thing. A cult doesn't have to be somebody with a crazy-eyed leader who's up there telling them what to do.
[03:40:27.400 --> 03:40:45.400]  Jim Jones or something, a cult can be a bizarre manifestation of a delusion that society now says is acceptable. Like identifying as something that you're not or identifying as a dog or a cat or whatever you feel, and that couldn't have happened without the mass promulgation of relativism.
[03:40:45.400 --> 03:41:08.400]  Whenever I say this, people think I'm talking about Einstein. That might be a physics corollary to relativism. No, I'm talking about in the philosophical sense, relativism is the idea that there's no truth that's objective and there are no morals that are objective. Everything is subjective. And so it's whatever you feel or it's a social construct.
[03:41:08.400 --> 03:41:36.400]  So you see that the population had to be injected with philosophical relativism through a hundred years of state education brainwashing to believe that there's no such thing as truth, to then be prepped for the system dictating to you that a man is a woman if they want it to be, that you can be a dog if you identify as that. Any delusion is now acceptable because your own subjective will can determine reality like magical thinking.
[03:41:37.400 --> 03:41:58.400]  You couldn't have that, though, without the population mass brainwashed with relativism. That first, then you can have all of these things that are the inversion of truth and reality, the inversion of hierarchy, the inversion of patriarchy, the inversion of morals.
[03:41:59.400 --> 03:42:25.400]  None of that could have happened or been successful without decades and decades and decades of brainwashing people into relativism, moral relativism, subjectivism, epistemic relativism. That just means that there's no truth. No, there's nothing in terms of knowledge that's true. You don't know anything true. I don't know anything true. Everything is whatever floats your boat, whatever you want. Do whatever you want. Do what thou wilt.
[03:42:26.400 --> 03:42:47.400]  You can see where it leads. If there's no truth, then anybody and everybody can just determine their own truths. And if that's the case, then I can identify as a puppy dog today. I can identify as a piece of popcorn tomorrow. It's funny, though, because I can't identify as Bill Gates. I can't identify as Elon Musk and suddenly be a billionaire.
[03:42:47.400 --> 03:42:55.400]  No, no, you can only identify as what's degenerate. And that's the key. This is the Alex Jones Show, and your guest is Jay Dargis. And also is covering the Committee of 300 by Dr.

[03:46:56.000 --> 03:47:03.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.100 --> 03:47:22.580]  We are working our way through the 21-point plan that Dr. John Coleman predicted would
[03:47:22.580 --> 03:47:29.660]  be laid out from 1990 all the way up until 2040-2050. So you're getting an accurate future
[03:47:29.660 --> 03:47:35.640]  prognostication from somebody who was inside the establishment at a certain level, found
[03:47:35.640 --> 03:47:41.700]  out about the top 300 or so people that really call the shots, the ballers and shot callers
[03:47:41.700 --> 03:47:47.040]  of the new world order, the Kissinger's, the Brzezinski's and so forth and decided to write
[03:47:47.040 --> 03:47:53.600]  a book that a lot of people were very skeptical about and yet it has almost all come true.
[03:47:53.600 --> 03:47:59.540]  Now we were talking about the pushing of various cults and counterculture that was
[03:47:59.540 --> 03:48:06.500]  fake that's actually put out by psyops engineers, put out by technocrats. And if you want an example
[03:48:06.500 --> 03:48:11.580]  of this, you can watch the movie Men Who Stare at Goats. And if you get to the end of the film,
[03:48:11.580 --> 03:48:17.460]  you'll notice in that movie that's actually about how they push this pop culture as a social
[03:48:17.460 --> 03:48:24.740]  engineering experiment and culture creation operation. At the end of the movie, you'll see
[03:48:24.780 --> 03:48:31.460]  they're doing that. They're actually in Iraq putting out American movies and DVDs intentionally
[03:48:31.460 --> 03:48:37.060]  to push a form of soft power and mind control through pop culture. It's actually referenced in
[03:48:37.060 --> 03:48:41.900]  the film because that's based on a real plan and a real story. The next thing he mentions in
[03:48:41.900 --> 03:48:46.620]  his list, this is the 13th here if you have the book, it's page 23, he says that really
[03:48:46.620 --> 03:48:52.820]  the model for all of this will be the British East India Company. So modern corporations are
[03:48:52.820 --> 03:48:58.020]  built on the model of the British East India Company. We know that Cecil Rhodes' British South
[03:48:58.020 --> 03:49:01.940]  Africa Company is also based on the British East India Company. This is a private corporate
[03:49:01.940 --> 03:49:08.020]  governance that was engaged in all kinds of basically just drug trafficking. The British East
[03:49:08.020 --> 03:49:14.340]  India Company was an opium dealing operation and the British power structure nobility made
[03:49:14.340 --> 03:49:22.300]  a lot of their wealth from that. And he says that in the US, a lot of the American
[03:49:22.300 --> 03:49:28.940]  evangelicals will be used as a tool by the British Empire. Well, they were used by the
[03:49:28.940 --> 03:49:33.140]  British Empire by putting out things like the Scofield Study Bible. John Nelson Darby was
[03:49:33.140 --> 03:49:37.540]  pushing a lot of that end times nonsense. I'm not saying there's no end times. I'm saying
[03:49:37.540 --> 03:49:41.460]  that the Scofield Study Bible was put out at the behest of the British Empire to push this
[03:49:41.460 --> 03:49:47.300]  idea and the rapture and all that. That ties into the geopolitics of what they want to
[03:49:47.300 --> 03:49:54.340]  push in terms of the establishment. Tied into controlled fake Christianity is a version of
[03:49:54.340 --> 03:50:00.260]  radical Islam that the West controls. And he identifies, as do many other writers,
[03:50:00.260 --> 03:50:06.260]  radical Muslims, radical Islam as a tool of the British Empire and British intelligence,
[03:50:06.260 --> 03:50:11.700]  particularly things like the Muslim Brotherhood. He says that the Muslim Brotherhood is a kind of
[03:50:11.700 --> 03:50:18.780]  fundamentalism that was basically set up and run by British intelligence for many, many years.
[03:50:18.780 --> 03:50:25.860]  And what they're able to do is use that sect, or these various sects, there's many sects of
[03:50:25.860 --> 03:50:32.980]  radical Muslims, as a tool, as a weapon for all kinds of things. For example, ISIS could be
[03:50:32.980 --> 03:50:38.740]  a skeleton key to blow up a pipeline in a certain region. That's happened in the past in terms of
[03:50:39.660 --> 03:50:45.620]  the war they were trying to get going with Syria, the proxy war that ISIS was doing in Syria
[03:50:45.620 --> 03:50:52.300]  against Assad. We saw ISIS operating in this way. We know that ISIS has dubious origins.
[03:50:52.300 --> 03:50:58.300]  Even Donald Trump says that basically Hillary and Obama were the main supporters and aiders
[03:50:58.300 --> 03:51:05.500]  and funders of ISIS. And that's because this is an older CIA and before that British intelligence
[03:51:05.500 --> 03:51:10.380]  model of how to run and control and utilize these groups like radical Islam.
[03:51:10.380 --> 03:51:15.620]  Now, it's not just radicalism because you can begin to see that the importation of masses
[03:51:15.620 --> 03:51:22.140]  of Islamic people into Europe, that's also part of this. And he even describes that. Dr.
[03:51:22.140 --> 03:51:28.540]  Coleman has a whole section on the importation of foreign cultures and foreign religious ideas as
[03:51:28.580 --> 03:51:36.260]  an intentional stated goal of this elite. And he says that you have to understand that religion
[03:51:36.260 --> 03:51:41.500]  is very crucial, very key to the new world order. They use that as one of the main means
[03:51:41.500 --> 03:51:47.220]  of societal control. I'm not saying all religions are bad or everybody in a religion
[03:51:47.220 --> 03:51:50.140]  is mind controlled or something like that. I'm not an atheist. I'm just saying that from
[03:51:50.140 --> 03:51:53.820]  the vantage point of the power elite, if you read early on in Brzezinski's book,
[03:51:53.820 --> 03:51:59.380]  Between Two Ages, he talks about utilizing American religion for the promotion of Americanism
[03:51:59.380 --> 03:52:04.300]  and then turning it into something else. David Wim Hof's book on John Courtney Murray
[03:52:04.300 --> 03:52:08.620]  and the Jesuits says exactly the same thing. The alliance between the CIA and the Jesuits
[03:52:08.620 --> 03:52:14.660]  during the Cold War, it might have seemed logical at the time to fight communism and
[03:52:14.660 --> 03:52:19.700]  Sovietism. However, now that you have a new master, your masters are ultimately the
[03:52:19.700 --> 03:52:24.180]  Rockefellers and the Western elite. They're going to utilize that control mechanism that
[03:52:24.180 --> 03:52:28.700]  they put in through your alliance with the CIA to then steer your church into what
[03:52:28.700 --> 03:52:34.140]  Francis is now pushing. Pope Francis just yesterday said it's time, eating meat is bad.
[03:52:34.140 --> 03:52:41.500]  People need to stop eating meat. He said it's time for morals to evolve and change. He says
[03:52:41.500 --> 03:52:45.900]  that anybody in America who's a traditional Christian, he says that they're backwards,
[03:52:46.140 --> 03:52:49.820]  whether you're Protestant, Catholic, or Orthodox. He says you're backwards,
[03:52:49.820 --> 03:52:51.900]  it's time to evolve and change.
[03:52:52.400 --> 03:53:01.240]  So remember, from the vantage point of the establishment, you want to control the really
[03:53:01.240 --> 03:53:08.100]  fringe radical sects, like the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS, and you want to control and steer the
[03:53:08.100 --> 03:53:14.320]  liberal side of it as well. Control the opposition, control both sides of the dialectic, and
[03:53:14.320 --> 03:53:19.880]  it's yours. You've won. Even Lenin said that, famously. The best way to win is to
[03:53:19.880 --> 03:53:25.060]  control the opposition. But you don't want to control just your opposition, control the
[03:53:25.060 --> 03:53:32.820]  various sides and pieces of the chessboard. Next, he says that America would be used as
[03:53:32.820 --> 03:53:41.500]  a tool to export religious liberation, freedom, and democracy. However, those are cloaks,
[03:53:41.500 --> 03:53:49.820]  not ultimately really to defeat communism and Sovietism, but actually to bring technocracy
[03:53:49.820 --> 03:53:56.699]  and control down the road. He says that the exportation of all the liberation ideas around
[03:53:56.699 --> 03:54:03.199]  the world, especially Christian liberation theology, was first begun with Jesuit theology.
[03:54:03.199 --> 03:54:09.560]  And this began in the reign of the downfall of the Somoza family in Nicaragua. And today
[03:54:09.560 --> 03:54:15.039]  it's being pushed in El Salvador, he's saying, in the 1990s. He's saying that this is pushed
[03:54:15.039 --> 03:54:19.279]  by a bunch of liberal progressives in the Roman Catholic Church that would like to
[03:54:19.279 --> 03:54:25.720]  see these things change into some sort of future communist technocracy. So even
[03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:31.100]  those people are duped into believing that communism is a real opposition to the system
[03:54:31.100 --> 03:54:37.640]  when communism is 100% and always has been completely run and controlled by the top wealthiest
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:41.920]  people on the planet. To take control of all foreign, religious, and domestic policies
[03:54:41.920 --> 03:54:48.000]  is the goal of the Committee of 300 in the US. In other words, you can't have populists,
[03:54:48.000 --> 03:54:51.440]  you can't have people even saying what Donald Trump says, according to the Committee of 300.
[03:54:51.440 --> 03:54:58.760]  Every area, every level down to local politicians has to be subverted, co-opted,
[03:54:58.760 --> 03:55:05.000]  and cajoled or even bought into supporting this. And this is why local cities are signing
[03:55:05.160 --> 03:55:12.480]  on to UN things, UN treaties, UN heritage zones. All of that is a trick, ultimately,
[03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:18.640]  to give international bodies local control. So it's not just about getting prominent senators,
[03:55:18.640 --> 03:55:25.520]  you know, and the president on your side. It's not just about lobbyists getting those guys.
[03:55:25.520 --> 03:55:33.080]  It's about your local, right, city commission people signing on to the sustainable agendas,
[03:55:33.160 --> 03:55:39.760]  for example. And that has to be done at all levels, according to the Committee of 300.
[03:55:39.760 --> 03:55:46.640]  Next, it says that all full support must be conceded to international bodies away from
[03:55:46.640 --> 03:55:51.320]  national bodies. So you have to destroy the presidency. I think that's a big part of what
[03:55:51.320 --> 03:55:55.560]  they've been doing in the last several years is destroying the presidency as well as destroying
[03:55:55.560 --> 03:56:02.520]  the notion of the Republic or destroying the notion of division of powers. All that has
[03:56:02.520 --> 03:56:09.600]  to be destroyed so that they can push it to international bodies. And so as more of these
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:17.080]  crises come about, they have no problem piling the blame on people like the president, people like
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:22.760]  various senators or even local American organizations and saying, you know, you see,
[03:56:22.760 --> 03:56:28.039]  you guys all failed. The whole system is a mess. It's got to be run by international bodies like
[03:56:28.039 --> 03:56:32.840]  the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the IMF, the BIS, the World Court.
[03:56:32.840 --> 03:56:38.000]  Those need to run things because you locals are all incompetent. You people in your own country,
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:41.720]  you can't do it. You're incompetent. You've got to have, and maybe not even just these
[03:56:41.720 --> 03:56:45.520]  international bodies, maybe the international bodies then say, oh, you've got to have an AI,
[03:56:45.520 --> 03:56:49.480]  right? You've got to have an AI judge and AI court. There's no other way to be fair.
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:53.960]  Penetrate and subvert all the governments. Well, that's exactly what Klaus says.
[03:56:53.960 --> 03:57:01.160]  We've penetrated the continents of the world. That's exactly what Dr. John Coleman said in 1992.
[03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:05.920]  Organizing control international terror operations. And at that time,
[03:57:05.920 --> 03:57:09.920]  Gladio had just come out and Dr. Coleman was actually talking about Operation Gladio,
[03:57:09.920 --> 03:57:15.240]  the P2 Lodge, Kissinger and all those other people calling the shots in these terror
[03:57:15.240 --> 03:57:19.480]  operations. So if you want to get my work and support it, you can go to my website,
