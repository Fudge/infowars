[00:33.660 --> 00:38.860]  kind of a first sneak peek as well not just the trailer you just saw coming up last hour
[00:38.860 --> 00:45.500]  William Lewis will continue to be with us with Gary Franchi the producer of Camp FEMA
[00:45.500 --> 00:50.260]  will tell you all about the film and they're really experts on FEMA camps so am I so we'll
[00:50.260 --> 00:55.540]  take your questions on FEMA camps on the police state on the casual society control grid tie it
[00:55.540 --> 01:03.020]  into the no-buy list for gun owners tied into the no-fly list the shutting down of garage
[01:03.020 --> 01:10.780]  sales the feds going after eBay this total control of the economy that's all coming up right now
[01:10.780 --> 01:15.300]  let's go to Jean anti-federalist Andrew Pat Wayne and others Jean you're on the air thanks for
[01:15.300 --> 01:22.700]  holding okay what I want to mention is on September 25 and 26 there's a meeting of the
[01:22.700 --> 01:30.180]  G20 in Pittsburgh and they're saying no no no semi-automatic rivals allowed in the city at
[01:30.180 --> 01:35.300]  that time in fact that's in my stack the print assault weapons ban for G20 I'm gonna cover
[01:35.300 --> 01:41.860]  that go ahead ma'am yeah truth dig org there's a big story about it but the other thing I want
[01:41.860 --> 01:52.220]  to mention her name is Naomi Wolf has done a very good it was earlier than your material but
[01:52.220 --> 02:00.900]  she details the 10 which a government will use to go from the democracy to a fascist state yeah
[02:00.900 --> 02:07.180]  we've had her on and she's been critical of Obama now she's a Rhodes scholar and she goes over the
[02:07.180 --> 02:13.420]  10 steps yes and it's all exactly what's happening yeah and I think that this G20 meeting on the
[02:13.420 --> 02:20.060]  25th and 26th of September in Pittsburgh may be the event that these that they're all getting geared
[02:20.060 --> 02:26.900]  up for well we're gonna get guest on about the G20 assault weapons ban which is all semi-automatic
[02:26.900 --> 02:31.140]  handguns and rifles what they do is that see for special events they say you don't have your
[02:31.140 --> 02:37.780]  rights then they expand it out to everything anything else Jean no I'm just I'm thinking of
[02:37.780 --> 02:43.900]  going there but I'm looking at this picture of the paramilitary being there and I'm wondering if
[02:43.900 --> 02:48.820]  I'm gonna get you know yeah well that's part of the intimidation that's why they hire provocateurs
[02:48.820 --> 02:54.620]  to attack the police so they can rubber bullet the whole innocent crowd to then scare everybody
[02:54.620 --> 02:59.100]  into not going to political events this is all that they've been caught in Denver last year it's
[02:59.100 --> 03:04.180]  in the Obama deception extras admitted to police attack their own cops they were caught in Canada
[03:04.180 --> 03:09.780]  a year and a half ago at the North American Union Summit police attacking police these are
[03:09.780 --> 03:14.420]  hardcore criminals and they never get in trouble for it ma'am I appreciate your call yeah here it is
[03:14.420 --> 03:22.140]  Pittsburgh post-cousette assault weapon ban for G20 summit gun debate springs from city proposal
[03:22.140 --> 03:28.260]  to control protesters that course concealed carry people are everywhere with guns which is even more
[03:28.260 --> 03:34.060]  dangerous but they don't care they don't want to see people with guns out in the open because that
[03:34.060 --> 03:41.940]  breaks the spell that guns are illegal see they run these ads and billboards saying reporting
[03:41.940 --> 03:46.500]  illegal guns and all the shows are based in New York or Chicago the dramas where a cop finds
[03:46.500 --> 03:51.140]  a gun in somebody's house and takes them to jail for it weak-minded people see that and think guns
[03:51.140 --> 03:57.660]  are illegal in Arizona and Texas when they're only illegal in DC and New York and Chicago
[03:57.660 --> 04:08.180]  Pittsburgh short-lived ban assault weapons quashed by attorney general the general assembly in 94
[04:08.180 --> 04:13.300]  still in the city's books and it may get new life under legislation driven by the next month G20
[04:13.300 --> 04:18.980]  summit a little notice clause in the proposed ordinance written by mayor Luke Ravenstalls
[04:18.980 --> 04:23.700]  administration to keep protesters from thwarting police crowd control efforts invokes the default
[04:23.700 --> 04:29.780]  assault weapons ban the clause says no person shall possess an array of items including 37
[04:29.780 --> 04:35.380]  contraband weapons listed on the ban so see this has been thrown out before but they're criminals
[04:35.380 --> 04:47.380]  they don't care for the purpose of defeating lawful removal by police its effect is a matter of
[04:47.380 --> 04:53.140]  debate so again under national or local emergencies they say you don't have a right to your guns
[04:53.700 --> 05:00.900]  because they're tired scum working for offshore banks raping us out of existence have you heard
[05:00.900 --> 05:06.020]  that millionaire entrepreneur businessman your congressional candidate and author robert beetles

[10:29.940 --> 10:34.420]  country to real fema camps talked to congressman about fema camps it's just an amazing film
[10:35.780 --> 10:40.020]  and i didn't talk to william before the show but i'm going to find out during a break if there's a
[10:40.020 --> 10:46.260]  clip or two in the film uh that he thinks we should play here today not just the trailers
[10:46.260 --> 10:53.300]  uh but uh william very exciting and i just want to say great job on camp fema hey man i appreciate
[10:53.300 --> 10:59.300]  it and uh thanks for having me on you know you uh you have a large part in in making camp fema so
[11:00.340 --> 11:04.420]  you know don't uh don't forget to thank yourself and i think as well and i think that once people
[11:04.420 --> 11:09.780]  get these they should be coming back to you for some more information uh you get you know this was a
[11:09.780 --> 11:15.540]  million different pieces that we had to whittle down to about a thousand and put together so um
[11:15.540 --> 11:20.100]  obviously everything that all of our guests said in the documentary when we were shooting didn't
[11:20.100 --> 11:25.700]  make it in there but uh i think that uh you'll notice you and uh what john stat miller kathryn
[11:25.700 --> 11:33.540]  blushed a couple others there um uh baldwin badnarik you know there were there were several people that
[11:33.540 --> 11:39.220]  we gave kind of special treatment to because you guys really are on the forefront of fighting the
[11:39.220 --> 11:44.100]  new world order and and really talking about yeah i've got to say stat miller i've never really
[11:44.100 --> 11:49.860]  seen him do tv he comes across really good on camera so i mean again the film is you want to
[11:49.860 --> 11:53.620]  hand something to somebody and say here's the proof of the fema camps you want to give something
[11:53.620 --> 11:58.580]  to glenn back or go to these tea parties this is it now i know you're mass producing it right now
[11:59.780 --> 12:03.860]  and we've already gotten some in but we're going to get the big group in what about a week and a
[12:03.860 --> 12:10.260]  half or so when can i start shipping these so people get them on the 18th or william will we
[12:10.260 --> 12:17.780]  be shipping these on the 18th well it really depends on the manufacturer and we've gotten good news
[12:17.780 --> 12:21.380]  that they're ahead of schedule so you may actually be able to ship those out a little bit ahead of
[12:21.380 --> 12:25.860]  time i can't guarantee it right at this point i've got to wait a little bit further along in
[12:25.860 --> 12:30.980]  production so that i know exactly what the ship date is but you know you guys are getting a special
[12:31.620 --> 12:35.380]  drop shipment right to your location so you might probably have those a couple of days ahead of
[12:35.380 --> 12:41.220]  everybody else i don't think you're probably selling them early or shipping them out earlier
[12:41.220 --> 12:45.620]  doing you know you've always done that you've got is it five or six films under your belt
[12:45.620 --> 12:52.900]  uh this is seven seven seven so established filmmaker first thing you ever did is you
[12:52.900 --> 12:56.100]  contacted me when i was making films of my own and said hey i'd like to come work with you
[12:56.100 --> 12:59.860]  and i said hey it's me and my wife and one other guy sorry i don't have the money to hire you
[12:59.860 --> 13:03.940]  but i'm glad i didn't have the money to hire you because you're off on your own that's what we need
[13:03.940 --> 13:08.980]  is lots of great people out making their own films and william i'm telling you it's not just that
[13:08.980 --> 13:13.620]  i'm in this film i think you'd ask me a few times being others and i was too busy i'm in this because
[13:13.620 --> 13:18.820]  i didn't have the time to make a fema camp film i advised i consulted you just did an incredible
[13:18.820 --> 13:24.100]  job and you've really knocked it out of the park on this one all the films were great i mean look
[13:24.100 --> 13:30.340]  folks camp fema is a real accomplishment this has got to be seen i haven't asked you this though
[13:30.340 --> 13:36.260]  where are you about people making copies if they don't sell it i know uh i've tried to go buy my own
[13:36.260 --> 13:40.420]  films or or or sell them on amazon we're about to start that and i can't because people claim
[13:40.420 --> 13:45.140]  they're their films and so i'm having to now write them letters and say you can't sell my films on
[13:45.140 --> 13:50.340]  amazon because they're claiming that they own my films she can get into trouble doing that but uh
[13:51.460 --> 13:55.700]  what i mean how is it going to work kind of a blind eye of folks are handing these out to people
[13:55.700 --> 14:00.900]  because i want this film to go supernova on the streets william yeah i understand and you know
[14:00.900 --> 14:06.100]  we haven't put it on the website yet and this is mainly because we just don't have uh the funds to
[14:06.100 --> 14:10.580]  make the duplications yet but as soon as we start getting them to coming in we'll be able to offer
[14:11.220 --> 14:17.860]  uh really inexpensive uh you know patriot tax where you can get uh 10 or 100 of these things
[14:17.860 --> 14:23.540]  at a time at a very good discount and uh you know we we hope to kind of go that way the uh
[14:23.540 --> 14:29.220]  the way erin rusa did his uh release so uh i think this will um i think this will probably be the
[14:29.220 --> 14:36.500]  best way you know if you get a copy of the uh the dvd uh you're welcome to duplicate it for yourself
[14:36.500 --> 14:41.460]  and your immediate family members that's not a problem at all never william i've got a i've got
[14:41.460 --> 14:45.860]  a copy of the film coming up just just start thinking about it now during the break tell me
[14:45.860 --> 14:50.900]  so we can play a mender to clip a couple times tell me a good spot i mean there's a lot of good
[14:50.900 --> 14:55.860]  spots here maybe when we're introducing the modern fema cams a clip or two that we can play
[14:55.860 --> 15:00.740]  of the film for the first time for people here today but for new listeners who don't know about
[15:00.740 --> 15:07.380]  the fema camps tell folks about your journey why you made the film obviously glenn beck was saying
[15:07.380 --> 15:12.340]  six months ago it wasn't real i know that spurred some of it uh what the film covers what you
[15:12.340 --> 15:20.580]  chronicle in camp fema well this journey began over 10 years ago back when i was you know just
[15:20.580 --> 15:25.620]  beginning to start learning about searching on the internet for these type of things roughly
[15:25.620 --> 15:32.820]  1995 or six and you know back then even then the information you could find on fema camps on the
[15:32.820 --> 15:36.820]  internet and they weren't called fema camps but you know the internment camps or concentration
[15:36.820 --> 15:40.740]  camps in america those types of things were readily available to you know there was a lot of
[15:40.740 --> 15:45.780]  information on it uh but they coincided with a lot of really bad information like you know
[15:46.740 --> 15:51.460]  things that we could necessarily prove such as they're being shipped with 40 000 guillotines to
[15:51.460 --> 15:56.180]  air force bases across the country at underground sites but you know et cetera et cetera and
[15:56.180 --> 16:00.820]  although i don't have you know problem research and those types of things and putting them into
[16:00.820 --> 16:03.940]  a documentary if i can prove them we couldn't prove any of that stuff that's why i say there
[16:03.940 --> 16:08.740]  was a million things that we had to whittle down to about a thousand what's credible what can we prove
[16:08.740 --> 16:13.620]  that's why this documentary is so unique because there's nothing in it that can in any way be
[16:13.620 --> 16:17.700]  disproved and not the whole on something else you know the entire argument that is laid out
[16:17.700 --> 16:23.700]  when people see this for the first time they're going to the first time realize that it's no
[16:23.700 --> 16:29.700]  longer an internet rumor it never has been all right but you know the whole process of getting
[16:29.700 --> 16:36.100]  here um you know gary and i teamed up on this about a year and a half ago just shooting footage
[16:36.100 --> 16:41.780]  and collecting everything we needed this is the first time we've had actors and in a production
[16:41.780 --> 16:50.500]  so gary's uh gary's niece christina reese plays our young victim and uh you can i think uh this is
[16:50.500 --> 16:55.940]  kind of a different emotional uh catch to this particular documentary which is why i think a
[16:55.940 --> 17:03.380]  lot of people are going to really get into it it's um it's the most scary documentary that i've ever
[17:03.380 --> 17:08.740]  made and not not just because of the subject matter but because of the way we laid it out we're you
[17:08.740 --> 17:14.500]  know obviously trying to set that tone that this is very serious and we just we don't let up you
[17:14.500 --> 17:18.740]  know we don't even start giving out solutions and things that you can do about this until probably
[17:18.740 --> 17:25.780]  i say the last 15 or 20 minutes of the documentary and it really is a journey down the dark side of
[17:25.780 --> 17:30.660]  government and where this is not likely to head to where this is going you know with the uh with
[17:30.660 --> 17:34.900]  the legislation that we're talking about that legitimizes these demon camps and the mindset
[17:34.900 --> 17:40.100]  of our leaders in washington showing the legislation that they want to pass that demonizes people like
[17:40.100 --> 17:45.860]  you and me for simply speaking out about government policy um you know this is the mindset of that's
[17:45.860 --> 17:50.740]  right you can't just cover fema camps you've got to show all the other legislation the attacks on
[17:50.740 --> 17:56.020]  free speech the government saying our number one threat is gun owners and veterans and we need to
[17:56.020 --> 18:01.780]  arrest them and the police pulling veterans over and ron paul supporters we just had a lady last
[18:01.780 --> 18:06.740]  hour it happened to and they said you got a short haircut ron paul sticker you you may be terrorist
[18:07.860 --> 18:13.460]  and the whole homeland security system set up for we the people lying to the good old boys telling
[18:13.460 --> 18:19.700]  folks it was for al qaeda so you cover this in the film camp fema william it's just amazing continue
[18:20.500 --> 18:26.020]  yeah i mean it's very up to date people will notice uh news clips and things in this documentary
[18:26.020 --> 18:31.220]  that may only be a week or two old simply because you know as we were finishing up the documentary
[18:31.220 --> 18:35.860]  there were several things that broke the howl turner story for instance whether we were lucky
[18:35.860 --> 18:40.100]  enough to be able to get that in there so that we could show people that the co entail operations
[18:40.100 --> 18:45.780]  from the 1950s 60s and 70s never really ended they were just continued under different names and um
[18:46.340 --> 18:52.580]  you know the glenn beck segment i don't know if you really have a chance to see that or not but uh
[18:52.580 --> 18:57.060]  i don't think it wasn't the first edit that we sent you but uh the glenn beck segment turned out
[18:57.060 --> 19:02.660]  to be just absolutely hilarious i mean it is funny to watch uh which is the reason why we had to
[19:02.660 --> 19:07.300]  actually stick it after the credit so people who get the film and you don't keep glenn beck in there
[19:07.300 --> 19:12.340]  you have to wait till the credit to finish and then the glenn beck segment begins and we did that
[19:12.340 --> 19:17.380]  mainly because it just totally broke the mood it just totally broke the spell that we were trying
[19:17.380 --> 19:21.460]  to set for everybody because you're literally laughing on the floor when you know but that's
[19:21.460 --> 19:26.580]  smart because it's a serious film with all the proof with congressmen admitting it with all the
[19:26.580 --> 19:33.060]  documents all their own admissions people saying camps are good not just people exposing camps and
[19:33.060 --> 19:40.580]  then you cut to beck lying and saying none of it exists exactly so william louis amazing job

[24:51.380 --> 24:56.900]  there i've in depth studied this for a long time i could even predict how beck was going to whitewash
[24:58.660 --> 25:03.780]  so we're fully aware of how these guys operate but we're going to take some calls right now and
[25:03.780 --> 25:08.660]  they get more into the film of william louis coming up anti federalist from georgia you're on
[25:08.660 --> 25:15.860]  the air with our guest william louis go ahead hey alex um i uh have a few comments unfortunately

[25:20.340 --> 25:25.940]  thing is uh a great documentary about what's going wrong with the one child policy in china and
[25:25.940 --> 25:31.860]  it's called uh china spill and babies also uh tonight one of the viewers and uh the listeners
[25:31.860 --> 25:39.460]  to know there's a special on 9 11 conspiracies on national geographic at nine so let me just add to
[25:39.460 --> 25:44.740]  that that in fact i i had that in my stack and i took it home will you get jason because he knows
[25:44.740 --> 25:51.940]  where it is national geographic has apologized about their previous film four years ago about why
[25:51.940 --> 25:58.180]  the towers collapsed similar to the nova special i think theirs is called why the buildings collapse
[25:58.180 --> 26:04.820]  novus why the towers collapsed using fake data about bad steel and fire melting it they've now
[26:04.820 --> 26:09.700]  changed their story with a new whitewash they're going to unveil tonight but they've been forced
[26:09.700 --> 26:14.740]  to apologize but i still have these idiots telling me why the towers collapsed and using
[26:14.740 --> 26:19.940]  their baloney but go ahead uh no i'm sure it'll be very interesting to see what they have to say
[26:20.980 --> 26:26.740]  also i i just got back from dc last week and uh of course there was a lot of things i could say
[26:26.740 --> 26:32.100]  about my trip but i did come back with some kind of flu and i'm happy to say i'm over it and uh
[26:32.100 --> 26:38.420]  there are swastikas all over the federal reserve building all around the uh i don't know what you
[26:38.420 --> 26:44.500]  would call it but the freezes the the stone carvings that outlined the building there's
[26:44.500 --> 26:49.540]  lots of symbols all over there but swastika's i did find and took some pictures of it so
[26:49.540 --> 26:55.540]  i just wanted to put that out there thanks for your time you mean not swastikas put up by
[26:55.540 --> 27:01.460]  citizens but in the carving the swastikas absolutely in the car oh yeah i mean i mean
[27:02.820 --> 27:09.060]  until 1940 american school children did the hitler salute you can google american school
[27:09.060 --> 27:13.060]  children to hitler salute at all major high schools you can show you la high school doing it
[27:13.620 --> 27:18.820]  and they put the fasci the symbol of fascism the bundle of sticks with the hatchet heads in the
[27:18.820 --> 27:24.500]  u.s senate and we were going to go that way with eugenics and everything else i appreciate your call
[27:24.500 --> 27:30.340]  william louis comments on that well just as we didn't go that way they just figured out a better
[27:30.340 --> 27:36.900]  way to disguise it uh and that's all i'll add to that good point andrew in canada you're on the
[27:36.900 --> 27:42.420]  air with a maker of camp fema hi alex uh i'm the first time caller i've been listening for just
[27:42.420 --> 27:48.100]  over a year now and i'd like to thank you for waking me up first of all um in canada it's funny
[27:48.100 --> 27:52.020]  actually because canadians are always apologizing for everything and i i actually uh i've gotten
[27:52.020 --> 27:56.260]  to the point where i just say apology accepted when they're always apologizing but i'd like to
[27:56.260 --> 28:02.740]  apologize to everyone out there for not waking up sooner um is a very traumatic experience to
[28:02.740 --> 28:09.300]  wake up and i i think that that should be discussed uh more um especially i mean you know it's it's
[28:09.300 --> 28:14.420]  literally like your world is turned upside down and and i'm through it now and i i get it you're
[28:14.420 --> 28:18.740]  you're calling earlier you were saying oh who out there you know can see the whole thing i can see
[28:18.740 --> 28:25.140]  this you know big machine of eugenics which um you know it requires humans the humans are the
[28:25.140 --> 28:30.180]  gears and the cogs of of this big machine and they can't go forward with any of this unless
[28:30.180 --> 28:37.220]  people uh you know willingly are part of it and i guess and they're racing to put it in place right
[28:37.220 --> 28:43.060]  now because they know their time is short they know the people are waking up exponentially
[28:43.060 --> 28:47.060]  but when you really face the horror you're like how could i not have been involved and i had an
[28:47.060 --> 28:50.980]  epiphany a few days ago and i'm going to hold you over if need be called or because i want
[28:50.980 --> 28:56.580]  you to continue to make a point andrew but i want to add this now i had an epiphany the elites at
[28:56.580 --> 29:01.140]  the very top were fully conscious they know the master plan they know what they're doing but most
[29:01.140 --> 29:08.100]  they're minions i mean even senators and people are compartmentalized and are picked by the system
[29:08.100 --> 29:13.540]  because they'll go along and rationalize and even believe a lot of their own propaganda
[29:13.540 --> 29:21.460]  and that's the thing is that it's not just that the good people aren't awake bad people aren't
[29:21.460 --> 29:28.420]  awake selfish people aren't awake to just what this world they're creating is and so all this
[29:28.420 --> 29:34.740]  denial all this rationalization all this denying what's going on is destroying human society and
[29:34.740 --> 29:38.980]  our liberties and freedoms i want to get william louis's comment on that statement then go back
[29:38.980 --> 29:44.820]  to andrew when we come back then wane then sit sam virgil and others we're talking about thema camps

[33:19.620 --> 33:22.980]  we've now been flying around the country for an upcoming film interviewing
[33:22.980 --> 33:27.860]  mayors and fish and wildlife people and government scientists and climatologists and
[33:27.860 --> 33:34.500]  weather weapons experts who work for the federal government one of them was the head of the naval
[33:34.500 --> 33:42.820]  weapons facility naval weapons research laboratory i mean the head of it all of this is real
[33:42.820 --> 33:47.380]  it's going on and then they just come out after this ago yeah we are spraying barium salts and
[33:47.380 --> 33:54.260]  aluminum dioxide that causes brain damage in all creatures including not just humans but uh reptile
[33:54.260 --> 34:04.900]  and uh also birds so the ornithologist should be concerned about that and then now they just come
[34:04.900 --> 34:09.220]  on go yeah we've been doing test all of this was the department of energy test and we're
[34:09.220 --> 34:14.260]  doing it with partners worldwide to manipulate the weather and we are practicing to knock out
[34:14.260 --> 34:21.940]  different types of weather to create floods and to create droughts and we're terraforming and
[34:21.940 --> 34:27.060]  they have government textbooks for school children in the last three years have come out where they

[34:33.460 --> 34:39.540]  that's what those trails are to protect you from global warming but then all the studies show it
[34:39.540 --> 34:45.540]  actually increases global warming because the ultra violent just goes right through it and then
[34:45.540 --> 34:52.580]  bounces back up and is captured look it's insane it's just like these fema camps it's all hidden
[34:52.580 --> 34:59.700]  in plain view and you wake up to this and you realize you're all part of a giant project with
[34:59.700 --> 35:08.100]  a scientific dictatorship playing god and you just can't only care about baseball or your church or
[35:08.100 --> 35:13.780]  or fishing anymore or whatever it is you're two-step it at the local bar i don't know what you do the
[35:13.780 --> 35:22.180]  point is we better i was talking to some pretty high-powered hollywood people last uh week when
[35:22.180 --> 35:29.380]  i was in la on a project and they said yeah how do you go back how do you care about any of this
[35:29.380 --> 35:34.500]  petty stuff anymore once you know about the new world order they want to keep you caught up and
[35:34.500 --> 35:39.380]  left and right and black and white and male and female and straight and gay and all these little
[35:39.380 --> 35:46.980]  things they have us fighting over meanwhile or north versus south or chinese versus america
[35:46.980 --> 35:50.980]  meanwhile the global corporations are playing all of us off against each other
[35:55.540 --> 36:00.100]  and this is the issue everything else is a side issue to the world government
[36:00.100 --> 36:05.460]  and what they're doing i want to go back to uh wane and candidate finish the statement he
[36:05.460 --> 36:11.060]  was making then back to the director of camp fema william louis go ahead it's andrew uh
[36:11.620 --> 36:18.180]  andrew alex um andrew canada wanes next yeah um well i mean doublespeak is i think it's a huge
[36:18.180 --> 36:23.060]  thing they they it's everywhere i think people really need to learn more to recognize the
[36:23.060 --> 36:28.180]  doublespeak you know for example when when the president comes out and says you know we are
[36:28.180 --> 36:32.500]  achieving our goals he's not talking about the american people he's talking about his cronies
[36:32.500 --> 36:38.340]  his insiders you know he's talking about that team the elite and he's just saying it to you as if
[36:38.340 --> 36:43.700]  you know people i get there are expected to think that they're part of it but they're obviously not
[36:43.700 --> 36:48.020]  and it's it's all over the place the writing is on the wall i mean if you want to know about
[36:48.020 --> 36:53.220]  chemtrails look up in the air there's chemtrails about well you're right but i mean the politicians
[36:53.220 --> 36:57.860]  love to say something that's a message to their people and they write about this in their memoirs
[36:57.860 --> 37:02.820]  and then and then has a double meaning for the sheep for the cattle they just love that
[37:03.860 --> 37:08.740]  if they get something out of it it somehow increases the the rush they get from from whatever
[37:08.740 --> 37:14.340]  this this dark powers um but uh you know you also talk about solutions and and with regards to the
[37:14.340 --> 37:19.940]  fema camps i actually was when i did wake up i i was in the middle of making an album and i ended
[37:19.940 --> 37:25.540]  up changing uh all sorts of the songs and lyrics around once i had discovered you know once i'd
[37:25.540 --> 37:31.300]  went down the rabbit hole and discovered this um you know the sick and twisted vision that's
[37:31.300 --> 37:36.900]  just being played out by the elite and uh in the second track on the album which is called Eugene
[37:36.900 --> 37:44.100]  Nixon uh i actually say we got led down to the nice new safe camp to learn all about Eugene
[37:44.100 --> 37:50.580]  Nixon we got knocked out in the greatest time to be rolling around like a pig in its pen and um you
[37:50.580 --> 37:55.940]  know people are being led down you know this path thinking that it's it's all you know grand and
[37:55.940 --> 38:01.140]  great and they have no idea that there's a big you know grinder at the end of uh absolutely
[38:01.140 --> 38:05.860]  i appreciate your call well more than that they know something's wrong but bush is bad obama will
[38:05.860 --> 38:12.820]  fix it then now well obama obama's bad but only because the evil right wingers won't let him do
[38:12.820 --> 38:17.860]  what he needs to do it's their fault we need to arrest them i mean i get hundreds of emails no
[38:17.860 --> 38:23.860]  exaggeration today when i look at youtube in the comments every third or fourth comment is
[38:23.860 --> 38:28.500]  you're a racist white pig you need to be arrested you click on their channel it's a white person
[38:29.140 --> 38:35.140]  or i look at local newspapers about the obama info wars dot com joker poster contest and they're
[38:35.140 --> 38:42.420]  saying these racists need to be arrested they're dangerous and these people really believe it
[38:42.420 --> 38:50.020]  because msnbc and cnn have said it is racist to show obama in a bad light and so they're under
[38:50.020 --> 38:57.300]  mind control how do you reach out to him william louis your comments well i i think that's a very
[38:57.300 --> 39:04.660]  touchy subject uh there's um really no appropriate way necessarily to handle it other than to just
[39:04.660 --> 39:09.460]  simply judge each president on their merits and i think that that's what we've got to do uh
[39:09.460 --> 39:16.900]  uh you know we we knew obama's record before he went into office i know that you were on your radio
[39:16.900 --> 39:20.980]  program telling people you got to watch out for this guy you have the obama deception out you
[39:20.980 --> 39:26.660]  know there was a lot of things going on but still all in all the guy got elected big surprise um
[39:28.100 --> 39:34.580]  i you know touchy subject uh i just uh i think we should judge people on their merits what they've
[39:34.580 --> 39:41.940]  done that's 31 but i mean it's so um it's so american it's so human to criticize the corrupt
[39:41.940 --> 39:47.140]  emperor the king the leader and over and over again i have several newscasts in fact guys will you
[39:47.140 --> 39:53.220]  queue up the north texas did i give you that the latest tv report where they're going i think it's
[39:53.220 --> 39:58.740]  wrong to show our president a bad light thank god we got him taken down before any young people
[39:58.740 --> 40:06.580]  saw them you know they're acting like our supporters were posting pornography or something again to call
[40:06.580 --> 40:12.660]  him a socialist to call him a fascist it isn't racist just because he's black again they're
[40:12.660 --> 40:19.220]  using that as a political tool is what i'm saying william sure i understand um uh you know if they
[40:19.220 --> 40:24.180]  feel that way uh i think they're really gonna hate campema because uh you know we've got an
[40:24.180 --> 40:28.900]  entire segment and they're dedicated showing how obama's putting together this uh youth army
[40:29.700 --> 40:34.980]  just like we saw put together in not see germany which of course was outlawed at one point because
[40:34.980 --> 40:40.740]  they knew what it was and then uh hitler managed to get it reinstated their their hitler youth that
[40:40.740 --> 40:47.700]  eventually became known as but um we're doing well that's why in africa they love 10 11 12 13
[40:47.700 --> 40:53.220]  year old citizen soldiers because they're wild fighters and think it's all a game and we'll do
[40:53.220 --> 41:00.020]  whatever they're told well this is the great thing about getting a hold of uh young minds you can
[41:00.020 --> 41:06.660]  train those young minds with all sorts of propaganda and have them do anything that you want i mean
[41:06.660 --> 41:11.540]  and how innocent too i mean this is you know this was kind of the whole idea of the uh youth army to
[41:11.540 --> 41:18.500]  begin with uh those will be the the spies in your community that will turn people over to the authorities
[41:18.500 --> 41:22.980]  because they did something that they weren't supposed to uh you know as innocent as a paper boy
[41:22.980 --> 41:28.100]  showing up to deliver the papers eat something on your desk that might be you know whatever mailman
[41:28.100 --> 41:31.460]  i mean this was a program that was started at the bush administration where they had mailman
[41:31.460 --> 41:36.420]  going around and uh profiling people that they were delivering the mail to so this is really
[41:36.420 --> 41:43.700]  not anything new it's just being carried one step further absolutely we're gonna play a select from
[41:43.700 --> 41:49.940]  um your film camp fema here in just a few minutes and continue with phone calls into the next hour
[41:49.940 --> 41:55.540]  with gary franchi and you'll stay with us but since i mentioned it and i've got a whole bunch of
[41:55.540 --> 42:00.580]  video newscasts these are coming in so many of them i can't even watch it a huge information
[42:00.580 --> 42:09.540]  war coup in that from berlin germany to tokyo japan from moscow russia uh to major capital cities
[42:09.540 --> 42:17.300]  in central and south america i've now been on uh ecuadorian tv other channels the obama
[42:20.020 --> 42:23.620]  obama as yeah we're playing a clip there in the background let's hold off for a second um
[42:24.980 --> 42:32.580]  everywhere this is being covered and it's not just because it's info wars dot com and obama
[42:32.580 --> 42:38.100]  as the joker to catch people's attention now our new contest is a thousand dollars for whoever
[42:38.100 --> 42:43.140]  makes the best poster period as long as it has info wars dot com or prison planet dot com on it
[42:43.140 --> 42:48.980]  videotapes putting those posters up on youtube and i will judge it off the best video about the
[42:48.980 --> 42:55.300]  posters and the poster itself that's what's fed into the decision of who wins but it's all about
[42:55.300 --> 43:02.020]  showing people the power of just putting up posters for a decade or more before 1776
[43:02.020 --> 43:07.620]  that's what our forebears did even if they shut the web down shut tv off shut our communications
[43:07.620 --> 43:14.180]  off which the pentagons announcing they are setting up a takeover of the internet to shut down
[43:14.180 --> 43:19.620]  opposition to north com and the 400 000 troops they've now announced they plan on putting on the
[43:19.620 --> 43:25.380]  streets they're trying a hot coup takeover they've listed veterans and gun owners and land owners
[43:25.380 --> 43:30.500]  as the terrorist you are being listed as terrorist this is real what happened in nazi germany and
[43:30.500 --> 43:36.580]  soviet russia and malice china and pol potz cambodia and fidel castros cuba is now happening
[43:36.580 --> 43:43.060]  and the end obama's new fcc head of quote diversity officer says they want to put in
[43:43.060 --> 43:50.900]  chavez controls here i mean they're not playing games and so make whatever poster you want get
[43:50.900 --> 43:58.580]  out there and put it up okay and then send us the video of you posting the poster any comments
[43:58.580 --> 44:05.300]  on the the our our our whole poster campaign and its success i did it showing people their power
[44:05.300 --> 44:08.100]  if they'll just take action with a message with an idea
[44:10.580 --> 44:14.580]  yeah this is uh you know posters are that are definitely the way to go especially if the
[44:14.580 --> 44:19.060]  internet ends up getting shut down uh dvds obviously are a great way to go because people
[44:19.060 --> 44:23.540]  don't have to uh read they can just pop in and watch it but the poster you know if you're clever
[44:23.540 --> 44:28.740]  enough about designing your poster and you know what 10 seconds that it takes to read that poster
[44:28.740 --> 44:33.300]  you can get your entire message across and i don't know that it's illegal to put them up
[44:33.300 --> 44:37.300]  at this point i'm gonna know that they're certain that you know they've tried to create a chilling
[44:37.300 --> 44:42.980]  effect they've dropped the charges on the teen or never filed them because it blew up in their face
[44:42.980 --> 44:47.140]  they tried to intimidate and it didn't work people put up more so they backed off in florida
[44:47.140 --> 44:51.460]  but no do it legally and lawfully take haze county in fact that article is out on the desk
[44:51.460 --> 44:55.140]  will somebody grab it for me about the hate crime i've committed it said it's not illegal that
[44:55.140 --> 45:00.500]  alex jones's listeners are putting him up in haze county but we need to pass a law to make it illegal
[45:00.500 --> 45:12.020]  go ahead yeah this is uh you know the uh continuation of uh the powers and and control that want to
[45:12.020 --> 45:19.380]  shut down opposition to their authority their control and uh just like we point out in camp
[45:19.380 --> 45:25.700]  fema these uh forces that are you know controlling our government it's not it's not obama and it's
[45:25.700 --> 45:30.820]  not george bush you know there's other people behind the fear of pulling the strings because we see
[45:30.820 --> 45:35.380]  too many similarities in there and their toxins and the way they think and the words that they use
[45:35.940 --> 45:40.900]  that's right there's a total congruency all and the national security council is the true
[45:40.900 --> 45:48.420]  dictatorship over fema over north com and all presidents are just frontmen exactly so you know
[45:48.420 --> 45:52.660]  if i don't know that it really makes any difference who's in power the the problem that we've got here
[45:52.660 --> 45:57.780]  is that anyone who opposes the administration on anything i mean literally we're talking about
[45:57.780 --> 46:03.940]  something as simple as immigration or abortion you know things that they've used in the past
[46:03.940 --> 46:08.020]  heavily to divide the republicans and the democrats now they're coming out and saying
[46:08.020 --> 46:12.500]  any opposition to the administration on these particular topics and probably you know a list
[46:12.500 --> 46:17.060]  of a dozen others that we've got listed in the film then you're going to be considered a potential
[46:17.060 --> 46:22.580]  domestic terrorist and people i don't think they understand it once you're once you're labeled as a
[46:22.580 --> 46:28.500]  potential domestic terrorist there's a whole nother set of rules that apply to you and uh those are
[46:28.500 --> 46:33.620]  the rules i think those are the ones we discussed that are going to be used to haul those people off
[46:33.620 --> 46:39.220]  to these fema camps and contain them keep them away from the public you know the the fema camp
[46:39.220 --> 46:44.180]  will be your free speech as a whole goes here and say what you need to say and you can't leave and
[46:44.180 --> 46:52.100]  um anyway you know it's a continuation of same old policies from the past we're just and william
[46:52.100 --> 46:58.500]  this is not your opinion when they say if your homeland security national id card now they issue
[46:58.500 --> 47:03.460]  a hemispheric north america id card that the tv ads are on television people are still in denial
[47:04.420 --> 47:08.580]  if you don't pay your bills if you have bad credit they're going to turn the card off this
[47:08.580 --> 47:15.860]  has been announced i saw ridge in 2002 before homeland security even got funding in a congressional
[47:15.860 --> 47:22.100]  round tables big four big tables together in a square and he was explaining it you're going to
[47:22.100 --> 47:26.660]  have to have this id to have a job you're going to have this id there'll be no underground economy no
[47:26.660 --> 47:32.420]  garage sales allowed no more roadside sales uh everything's going to be controlled we're going
[47:32.420 --> 47:38.820]  to have tsa in the streets at the malls on the buses in the trains checkpoints the feds are
[47:38.820 --> 47:44.020]  going to take over the local cities through the threat fusion centers through fema and he was
[47:44.020 --> 47:51.540]  saying how great this was and how and then now they say no fly list a million two hundred thousand
[47:51.540 --> 47:58.260]  and growing on it now you'll be a no gun by list and they openly are announcing that we'll just say
[47:58.260 --> 48:03.300]  you can't own a gun no judge no jury are not arrested and their own homeland security documents
[48:03.300 --> 48:09.380]  leaked to us that we put out from good people inside a federal marshal gave it to us i'll just
[48:10.180 --> 48:16.820]  leave it at that says gun owners and veterans are the number one threat to america it's all
[48:16.820 --> 48:22.420]  for the american people it was never about al qaeda al qaeda's cia go ahead
[48:22.420 --> 48:29.860]  uh yeah you know you probably can add a few other things to that list too uh gun control
[48:29.860 --> 48:34.900]  federal reserve if you're against the united nations or north american union if you even
[48:34.900 --> 48:40.020]  mention the word new world order if you have a problem with your income tax or being radio
[48:40.020 --> 48:45.940]  frequency identified with an rfid chip and tract that's a problem for them if you are against abortion
[48:45.940 --> 48:50.580]  or illegal immigration you know those are their main topics if you're protesting the fed and
[48:50.580 --> 48:55.460]  now they're saying if you say no to the naked body scanner don't put your wife and kids in it
[48:55.460 --> 48:59.780]  to scan your naked body they're going to put you on a no fly list as a terrorist i mean this
[48:59.780 --> 49:05.140]  government is completely rogue and criminal absolutely and you know this this all ties into
[49:05.860 --> 49:09.780]  uh like you were mentioning before you know people who own private property and who believe
[49:09.780 --> 49:15.620]  that their private property rights outweigh any uh you know federal intervention or even states coming
[49:15.620 --> 49:20.020]  in and saying that if you don't pay your taxes we're going to take that property away from you
[49:20.020 --> 49:25.780]  those types of issues i know that this is really big right now in kansas city um in fact we you know
[49:25.780 --> 49:31.060]  we covered the uh the tenth amendment as part of the conclusion in this documentary as a solution
[49:32.180 --> 49:39.860]  and what we're talking about of course is uh states rights uh the the citizens the citizenry going back
[49:39.860 --> 49:45.780]  and uh electing sheriffs and their communities that they know uphold and stand for the constitution
[49:45.780 --> 49:50.340]  and then again getting involved yourself running for these local offices where politics actually
[49:50.340 --> 49:55.940]  begins because if you can affect you know if you can influence your local politics that's where it
[49:55.940 --> 50:01.460]  all begins and that trickles up to your state which is where it's supposed to stop but unfortunately
[50:01.460 --> 50:06.420]  that you know the feds have found a way to sneak in there and try to withhold you know federal aid
[50:06.420 --> 50:10.820]  or funding for whatever reason if you don't sign on to their new legislation or whatever they have
[50:10.820 --> 50:16.580]  in store for you that's it yeah exactly we've got to say no to the federal government that
[50:16.580 --> 50:22.260]  itself is run by offshore private banks openly and we've just got to say you're illegitimate
[50:22.260 --> 50:27.620]  you're criminal it's over your north com isn't going to march against us i mean have you seen in
[50:27.620 --> 50:33.620]  the ap where they're announcing 400 000 troops to now occupy the u.s i mean this is real folks
[50:34.820 --> 50:40.580]  this is real and no amount of thumb sucking or denial is going to stop it only getting up getting
[50:40.580 --> 50:45.140]  angry getting focused getting camp fema getting the obama deception getting the new world order

[54:59.860 --> 55:05.140]  let's go ahead and go to a uh clip here uh some of the selects from camp femo here it is
[55:06.020 --> 55:11.700]  and technology has created a new brand of terrorism there were persons who for whatever reason
[55:12.420 --> 55:17.940]  came to view their home country as the enemy the kind of right wing religious-based domestic
[55:17.940 --> 55:23.620]  terrorism disturbing news tonight about homegrown terror part of this is a big change in the white
[55:23.620 --> 55:28.020]  house and the cultural experience and some of the crazies are coming out of their closet right now
[55:28.020 --> 55:33.220]  looks like there is no connection between the been arrested and any known terrorist cell homegrown
[55:33.220 --> 55:37.620]  uh yeah homegrown i should say uh folks we've got a very serious situation here i'm holding
[55:38.180 --> 55:43.300]  what is called the right wing extremism current economic and political climate fueling resurgence
[55:43.300 --> 55:48.580]  and radicalization and recruitment and in it we talked about the fact that they define pro lipers
[55:48.580 --> 55:55.300]  as domestic terrorists they put this in a department of homeland security uh document this official
[55:55.300 --> 56:00.580]  assessment now saying pro lipers people that believe in end time prophecies people that are
[56:00.580 --> 56:04.900]  opposed to the administration's position on immigration uh those of us that are standing
[56:04.900 --> 56:10.180]  up for the sanctity of life and for the sanctity of marriage all of those are now potential and
[56:10.180 --> 56:15.940]  this is what they're saying domestic terrorists it's a terrorist next door that can be our bigger
[56:15.940 --> 56:22.660]  threat they call people who believe in a sanctity of life who believe in owning firearms who believe
[56:22.660 --> 56:27.780]  in serving their country the military and coming back who are very concerned about the policies
[56:27.780 --> 56:33.780]  that this nation is embarking on spending too much money taxing too much it's all listed right here
[56:34.340 --> 56:39.700]  these are the domestic right wing extremists one million names under the watch rely of the
[56:39.700 --> 56:44.900]  united states america's so-called terrorist watch list has hit the record number according to one
[56:44.900 --> 56:48.980]  of the country's most prominent civil liberties groups that's a lot of people to keep track of
[56:48.980 --> 56:53.620]  they're adding new people all the time it's a secret list that you don't know really quite how
[56:53.620 --> 57:03.540]  one gets on and you don't know how you get off they're coming out and profiling huge groups of
[57:03.540 --> 57:08.980]  people you know if you voted for a certain political candidate you should be considered a potential
[57:08.980 --> 57:15.860]  threat and you couple that with things like the patriot act where if you are a threat in their
[57:15.860 --> 57:23.460]  eyes you can be held without access to judge jury and and without access to a liar or even to your
[57:23.460 --> 57:30.500]  family that's very concerning because we've watched our country go through and do this to brown people
[57:30.500 --> 57:35.620]  you know overseas they're rounding up enemy combatants they're putting them in camps and
[57:35.620 --> 57:42.900]  they are torturing them that is a fact we know that in Missouri a new document meant to help
[57:42.900 --> 57:50.420]  Missouri law enforcement agencies identify militia members or domestic terrorists has drawn criticism
[57:51.060 --> 57:56.740]  the february 20 report called the modern militia movement mentioned such red flags as
[57:57.380 --> 58:03.380]  political bumper stickers for third party candidates such as ron paul who ran for president talk of
[58:03.380 --> 58:08.980]  conspiracy theories such as the plan for a superhighway linking canada to mexico and possession
[58:08.980 --> 58:13.700]  of subversive literature so that the state police in Missouri have been told that if you see a car
[58:13.700 --> 58:20.420]  with a bumper sticker that opposes the so-called creation of north american union the silver super
[58:20.420 --> 58:25.940]  highway that you are probably following a militia member that you are following an anti-government
[58:25.940 --> 58:31.700]  radical if you see a car with a bumper sticker that says ron paul for president you might be
[58:31.700 --> 58:40.100]  dealing with a violent radical exercise extreme part of us and now they say if you disagree

[1:00:36.260 --> 1:00:41.380]  balance of the hour the producer of camp fema with the director right now william louis i want to
[1:00:41.380 --> 1:00:46.180]  continue right now with your phone calls i'm also going to smatter in some other top stories we
[1:00:46.180 --> 1:00:52.660]  haven't gotten to yet coming up in this hour wane and canada you're on the air welcome what's on
[1:00:52.660 --> 1:00:59.940]  your mind hi how are you alex i'm a first-time caller welcome thank you um i just want to let
[1:00:59.940 --> 1:01:06.820]  you know that my wife um was listening to your show for the last year and a half two years
[1:01:06.820 --> 1:01:16.340]  and i am now just becoming a believer in the last few months but she has heard your comment
[1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:24.340]  about the government doesn't own the sun yet okay and we both believe that of course now what she
[1:01:24.340 --> 1:01:32.020]  has done is filed an actual document with the government to claim the power of the sun the
[1:01:32.020 --> 1:01:39.940]  the energy of the sun and we have the business number and now we have the documents for the patent
[1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:48.340]  oh that's an idea and then because you can also sue them over their kim trailing that's torturous
[1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:56.900]  interference right when they try to block the sun out uh the science r says they're doing this and
[1:01:56.900 --> 1:02:02.420]  want to expand it that's hurting your crops that's hurting your life that's why they keep the details
[1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:07.220]  secret so people have trouble suing them but i think that's a way to stop them let's bring
[1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:14.660]  william louis up william that's an intriguing idea that uh wane has in canada yeah i guess the
[1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:19.780]  question is whether they would actually let you take out a patent on something like that what is
[1:02:19.780 --> 1:02:25.780]  the patent for could you explain that a little more yeah what is the patent for sir okay the
[1:02:25.780 --> 1:02:34.180]  patent is not for the sun it's for the energy from the sun got you as in as into power of solar panel
[1:02:35.940 --> 1:02:41.220]  now i think they only let you patent the device itself you can't patent a naturally occurring
[1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:47.060]  thing though that's what the gmo companies do when they alter something then they claim ownership of
[1:02:47.060 --> 1:02:52.260]  it um but it's an intriguing idea you want to write it up as an idea wane just to get people
[1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:57.540]  thinking i think it's a good exercise send it to us at writersandinfowars.com thank you wane

[1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:35.860]  obama joker put fascism put new world order put info wars dot com under it and also improved on the
[1:09:35.860 --> 1:09:40.980]  image by oh you know more saturating it making it look a little bit cleaner we've got better images
[1:09:40.980 --> 1:09:46.580]  of him as the joker and bush as the joker so those are going to be the only ones that are available

[1:10:25.460 --> 1:10:30.500]  light poles though the state attorney general said they're not going to charge the youth who put them
[1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:34.580]  up in one area florida because when they got when they said they were about to arrest him
[1:10:34.580 --> 1:10:40.740]  people put up hundreds of times i mean it's all over florida the toronto star told me saturday
[1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:48.900]  when they called me they said every road in the city has them they said are you behind this and i
[1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:54.900]  said no it's my idea but i said no she said i mean did you hire hundreds of people i said no
[1:10:55.540 --> 1:11:00.420]  people are mad that the media tried to censor them and said they couldn't put this image up
[1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:05.780]  and this is only the beginning so the joker thing is out of control it's awesome it lets the system
[1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:09.780]  know they're not going to silence us with the announcements of how the pentagon's taking the
[1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:16.260]  web over to quote shut it down and to quote shut alternative blogs down i mean it's really happening
[1:11:16.260 --> 1:11:21.940]  the pentagon themselves say this you know they're freaking out and seeing that news in the ap it's
[1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:27.380]  much worse than this the establishment is losing the hearts and minds they're going to shut the
[1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:31.620]  web down they're going to launch fake cyber attacks against the web and shut it down the name of its
[1:11:31.620 --> 1:11:36.500]  safety i've been telling you that for eight months they're now saying it they're now getting you ready
[1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:44.660]  to accept it so go get the obama info wars dot com posters that are up on info wars dot com in
[1:11:44.660 --> 1:11:50.020]  the contest area post them i've gone out into it don't let them chill your free speech but more
[1:11:50.020 --> 1:11:56.420]  importantly and i'm done plugging this we have a contest running through friday and i may extend
[1:11:56.420 --> 1:12:00.980]  it a little bit because i'm still getting videos of people putting up the obama joker and i've
[1:12:00.980 --> 1:12:05.940]  gotten hundreds and hundreds and i mean it's it's over 300 curtain ammo said and that was a few days
[1:12:05.940 --> 1:12:11.860]  ago of different ideas for poster art we're having a contest for the best political poster
[1:12:11.860 --> 1:12:20.020]  anti war anti vaccine anti fluoride anti chem trail it'll be whoever makes the best poster and
[1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:24.900]  on any subject will judge it on what gets the message across the best not even what issue it is
[1:12:24.900 --> 1:12:31.300]  i'm the judge that's half of it the other half is posting it in public and video taping it and
[1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:37.060]  uploading it to youtube or another major video site and sending it to contest at info wars dot
[1:12:37.060 --> 1:12:43.380]  com that is the contest not the hundreds and hundreds of posters you're sending us it needs
[1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:50.740]  to be posted in public and videoed that so the message is we're not just putting it up about
[1:12:50.740 --> 1:12:56.980]  obama a lot of people made them with obama and bush next to each other saying that you know
[1:12:56.980 --> 1:13:03.620]  they work for the new world order two sides of the same coin very effective whatever it's about
[1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:09.780]  showing the establishment that the people can take over the information war if we want to
[1:13:09.780 --> 1:13:14.820]  that is now what's happening so that said this is why we need to put up more posters now than ever
[1:13:15.540 --> 1:13:19.860]  just don't do it on government property meaning property the slaves can't touch
[1:13:19.860 --> 1:13:24.980]  meaning you pay the money and the government tells you how to live all over texas they you know they
[1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:30.580]  called for my arrest they've called they called it hate speech haze county it's not illegal they
[1:13:30.580 --> 1:13:36.100]  say it should be made illegal so i can be arrested uh it's spanish tv internationals calling for my
[1:13:36.100 --> 1:13:44.900]  arrest you know the tv here in the u.s you've all seen it we boldly just said bring it on first
[1:13:44.900 --> 1:13:49.620]  amendment they were going to arrest this youth in florida the one guy an obama supporter came
[1:13:49.620 --> 1:13:54.260]  up for taking photos saying i'm reporting you like a body snatcher you know i'm a nazi i'm

[1:13:58.420 --> 1:14:03.940]  obama supporters rip them down everywhere put up 10 times more here is the local newscast
[1:14:03.940 --> 1:14:10.660]  out of northeast texas pretty big town whether acting like a murder's been committed or a bank
[1:14:10.660 --> 1:14:15.460]  robberies happened and they're hyper ventilating and freaking out and oh my god the youth it's so
[1:14:15.460 --> 1:14:22.820]  scary yeah the the public schools are pushing riddling prozac swat teams drug dogs teaching
[1:14:22.820 --> 1:14:27.540]  people how to be petty and mindless government brainwashing dumbing them down we teach them to
[1:14:27.540 --> 1:14:33.220]  respect the local authorities and the president thank god we ripped them down before the youth saw
[1:14:34.980 --> 1:14:39.860]  oh yeah thank and then then they say it was anti war dot com you can see the video at the school
[1:14:39.860 --> 1:14:44.180]  it says info wars dot com so i guess they want they thought they would get me by not
[1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:49.700]  showing info wars dot com it isn't about info wars dot com it's about getting everybody to
[1:14:49.700 --> 1:14:55.860]  be active and to see the power you have that's what gondy did for 20 plus years in india that's
[1:14:55.860 --> 1:15:02.660]  what i'm doing is showing you the power you've got to stand up to these parasite trash we're going
[1:15:02.660 --> 1:15:08.660]  to francey and everybody in a minute but i wanted to get to this here's the local newscast out of
[1:15:08.660 --> 1:15:16.020]  k l tv as we analyze it here it is there's depicting president obama as the joker started
[1:15:16.020 --> 1:15:20.980]  appearing in tyler texas yesterday the altered picture of the president was made by a college
[1:15:20.980 --> 1:15:28.260]  student and has since gone worldwide via youtube up to 20 posters were put on trees signs and windows
[1:15:28.260 --> 1:15:34.900]  the only message was the website address info wars dot com that's the online site for a syndicated
[1:15:34.900 --> 1:15:40.900]  radio talk show host who offered $1,000 to the person who puts up the most obama joker okay let's
[1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:44.660]  stop right there some believe the president the guys had no way to communicate it to me
[1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:52.260]  and that's the old one from two weeks ago the new one if you see it says video no longer available
[1:15:53.780 --> 1:15:59.540]  and i think that got linked by drudge it probably crashed k l tv site but that one talked about how
[1:15:59.540 --> 1:16:06.980]  evil and bad it was at the school so let's go to gary franchi gary and and and again the producer of
[1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:11.860]  camp fema now available at info wars dot com and william louis i had you guys hold the last six
[1:16:11.860 --> 1:16:15.860]  seven minutes through that because do you concur with what i'm saying or do you have anything to
[1:16:15.860 --> 1:16:21.940]  add or do you do you disagree no i'm actually well i'll censor have me out you know i'm ready to go
[1:16:21.940 --> 1:16:27.700]  out and hit the streets myself i drove down the street in my town i saw this beautiful line of

[1:16:33.460 --> 1:16:37.460]  down to kinko's print up a whole bunch and do it myself so i think it needs to be done
[1:16:38.980 --> 1:16:43.620]  absolutely i saw a newscast freaking out in temple about somebody putting up
[1:16:43.620 --> 1:16:48.980]  tenpenny.com the doctor and saying the vaccines are killing you and doctors going don't say that
[1:16:48.980 --> 1:16:54.420]  it's lies the garter cells killed a bunch of people they admit the flu shot test in europe
[1:16:54.420 --> 1:17:00.820]  i got it wrong not the us but in europe killed some people i mean google flew vaccine kills
[1:17:00.820 --> 1:17:06.420]  in europe i mean it was it was london telegraph so yeah they're telling us we can't go out and
[1:17:06.420 --> 1:17:12.100]  put something up we've got to just sit here and accept their propaganda no it's it's ridiculous
[1:17:12.100 --> 1:17:16.660]  it's uh you know it's time for the american people to rise up and you know i'm listening to you on
[1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:21.140]  this end and i'm i'm getting fired up i'm jumping out of my seat you know uh and i hope that everyone
[1:17:21.140 --> 1:17:25.940]  else listening is feeling the same way it's time to stand up it's time to rise up you will not find
[1:17:25.940 --> 1:17:30.820]  me in a FEMA camp you will not find me there well that's the thing about the film you and
[1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:34.980]  william have made it's just amazing because it covers everything it proves the history of it
[1:17:34.980 --> 1:17:40.420]  how they operate the police state the demonization of dissidents that go with it the co entelepro
[1:17:40.420 --> 1:17:47.060]  feds i mean you guys have knocked it out of the park gary elix i am a god blessed american citizen
[1:17:47.060 --> 1:17:56.900]  and i will be i am so fed up with these these elitists who are putting putting presidential
[1:17:56.900 --> 1:18:04.820]  candidates ron paul chuck baldwin bach bach listening them as if i'm a supporter i'm a violent extremist
[1:18:04.820 --> 1:18:09.780]  well what is this what is this country to come well it's an attempt it's an attempt to chill free
[1:18:09.780 --> 1:18:15.060]  speech as you know and it's an attempt to shut you down and to make everybody scared to have
[1:18:15.060 --> 1:18:20.900]  political speech just like when they say criticizing obama is the n word i mean they are brutally
[1:18:20.900 --> 1:18:28.340]  trying to silence free speech william lewis comments well yeah here we go again i think that the
[1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:33.940]  the poster idea is a great idea what gary was saying too about the no vaccination you know
[1:18:33.940 --> 1:18:38.260]  those are some of the issues that are dealt with in the documentary we try not to get
[1:18:38.260 --> 1:18:42.100]  really specific and say that you know this is exactly what they're going to do with swine flu
[1:18:42.100 --> 1:18:47.140]  because we've seen this happen before with anthrax and smallpox and you know back in 2000 and 2003
[1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:51.860]  when they wanted to vaccinate us then but this is a very real scenario and if we uh we go ahead
[1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:55.940]  and start educating people 3d posters that we can put up in people's neighborhoods or you know
[1:18:55.940 --> 1:19:01.860]  wherever you want to um that that i think is uh a great way to go maybe uh put a website at the
[1:19:01.860 --> 1:19:08.500]  bottom uh so that they can get some information on it absolutely i i want to continue getting into
[1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:12.820]  camp fema but i do want to go to bencent and virginia sam and the netherlands and others that are
[1:19:12.820 --> 1:19:18.340]  holding but uh gary i think camp fema is going to really be effective and that's why i'm asking
[1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:24.180]  my listeners to get it to pre-order it today it comes out in two weeks and to show it to everybody
[1:19:24.180 --> 1:19:28.900]  have viewing parties are you wanting this to be like uh some of the other films like freedom to
[1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:33.940]  fascism that you're the steward of that that that that that are meant to be virally distributed
[1:19:33.940 --> 1:19:38.500]  well we want them to get out there we want the people to see that we want them doing parties
[1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:42.900]  um you know the film is copyrighted so we we know we can't produce more films
[1:19:42.900 --> 1:19:46.900]  the less people get them uh but we're going to provide a bulk system in the future
[1:19:48.260 --> 1:19:51.780]  absolutely and we'll be part of that at info wars dot com but they should have viewing parties and

[1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:15.300]  tell that it's made for uh supposedly for say illegal illegal immigrants or possible
[1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:22.100]  terrorist versus american citizens i mean how do you tell there's a thing the the japanese
[1:26:22.100 --> 1:26:28.900]  internment camps were not even built when they were uh rounded up when i spoke to the internment
[1:26:28.900 --> 1:26:34.820]  camp survivor samozaki uh japanese american you know born in the united states okay just
[1:26:34.820 --> 1:26:40.740]  like us citizen uh he was rounded up bust off to these uh to these camps but the camps
[1:26:40.740 --> 1:26:47.700]  like i said they weren't built they used stadiums they used uh you know amusement parks fairgrounds
[1:26:47.700 --> 1:26:53.380]  uh you know just large public facilities and held in there while the camps were being
[1:26:53.380 --> 1:26:58.980]  constructed so and gary that's exactly what i explained to you if you look at top off and
[1:26:58.980 --> 1:27:03.860]  in le exercises they practice putting you in sports stadiums putting you in facilities
[1:27:03.860 --> 1:27:09.140]  then they bust groups of you off and then they make you build the camp you're going to live in
[1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:15.540]  exactly and you know the gentleman's asking what what what makes a what what are the uh specific
[1:27:15.540 --> 1:27:20.900]  characteristics of a FEMA camp well you know hey next time you drive in that past your high school
[1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:25.780]  look at the fences imagine everyone rounded up inside the fences in your in your high school
[1:27:25.780 --> 1:27:31.380]  stadium okay now it's as simple as that uh we're taking a step further i mean they were using
[1:27:31.380 --> 1:27:37.700]  uh they're using churches in chicago to hold german immigrants you know uh they have the
[1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:44.740]  uh the actual prison cubes the concrete prison cubes that they can drop in like legos and build
[1:27:44.740 --> 1:27:51.060]  them up overnight so and the feds i mean look this is not our opinion they admit and and they're
[1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:55.060]  setting it up where you're going to want to be in the camp like oh you're starving you want to be
[1:27:55.060 --> 1:28:02.740]  you're not allowed to be homeless now you've got to live in the camp yeah so the film the film
[1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:08.500]  breaks it down um you know obviously there's the the the inward facing barbed wire the the guard
[1:28:08.500 --> 1:28:14.500]  towers i mean these are staples of standard camps that are existing in the city and the
[1:28:14.500 --> 1:28:20.020]  existing today um but what's most importantly is you know they can build these camps overnight
[1:28:20.020 --> 1:28:26.340]  within 24 hours look on record the feds built the robert mehler airport and they have a large area
[1:28:26.340 --> 1:28:32.500]  designated i have local news admitting it i mean they take facilities that have barbed wire and
[1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:39.220]  that's the camp and there's guys with machine guns there go ahead well i mean that's it you're
[1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:45.780]  seeing it right there the camp they take an existing camps from the uh the clinton administration
[1:28:45.780 --> 1:28:50.100]  when they decommissioned all of military bases they converted those camps they've converted
[1:28:50.820 --> 1:28:55.380]  countless other locations across across the country the civilian inmate labor program
[1:28:55.380 --> 1:29:00.420]  uh the alice was talking with us on the uh on the break there's a lot of characteristics check
[1:29:00.420 --> 1:29:06.660]  out the film pier itself and the federal bill tries to legalize and fund what's already set up
[1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:11.860]  everything we always said the camps were and how they worked is mirrored in the congressional bill
[1:29:11.860 --> 1:29:18.980]  that says the old military bases barbed wire local police involved army running it a brig family
[1:29:18.980 --> 1:29:25.620]  living areas this i mean this is already happening in plain view hr 645 right there

[1:33:54.340 --> 1:34:01.780]  the snake on it the marine corps was the first to use it in south carolina while engaging
[1:34:01.780 --> 1:34:09.380]  british ships in some cases 10 to 1 it's now demonized by the department of homeland security
[1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:20.420]  as a symbol of terrorism but i wanted to read to you what the founders said in 1754 during
[1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:25.940]  the french and indian war franklin publishes famous woodcut of a snake cut into eight sections
[1:34:25.940 --> 1:34:30.820]  it represented the colonies with new england joined together at the head of the south carolina
[1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:37.380]  as the tail following their order along the coast under the snake the message was join or die and
[1:34:37.380 --> 1:34:42.340]  for prison planet dot tv viewers this was then used early on the revolutionary war so that's when
[1:34:42.340 --> 1:34:49.300]  the rattlesnake was first seen then it was picked up in 1776 by the marines by the marine corps
[1:34:50.580 --> 1:34:57.700]  and writing then as the american revolution grew closer the snake began to see more uses a symbol
[1:34:57.700 --> 1:35:04.180]  for the colonies it's the true symbol of america in 1774 paul revere added it to the title of his
[1:35:04.180 --> 1:35:11.380]  paper the massachusetts spy as a snake joined to fight a british dragon in december of 1775
[1:35:11.380 --> 1:35:15.620]  benjamin franklin published an essay in the pennsylvania journal
[1:35:20.900 --> 1:35:28.660]  under the pseudonym american gosser they're doing some audio testing in there today with
[1:35:28.660 --> 1:35:31.460]  a new audio system i don't know if you're people are hearing that on air but it's hard for me to
[1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:38.020]  talk with it doing that i'm going to start over now try as hard as i can here as the american
[1:35:38.020 --> 1:35:44.020]  revolution grew closer the snake began to see more and more uses a symbol of the colonies in 1774
[1:35:44.020 --> 1:35:49.460]  paul revere added it to the title of his paper the massachusetts spy as a snake joined to fight a
[1:35:49.460 --> 1:35:57.220]  british dragon in december 1775 benjamin franklin published an essay in the pennsylvania journal
[1:35:57.220 --> 1:36:02.580]  under the pseudonym american gosser in which he suggested that the rattlesnake was a good symbol
[1:36:02.580 --> 1:36:08.820]  of the american spirit this is benjamin franklin now known as a terrorist by homeland security
[1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:17.540]  literally i have him on video being demonized by homeland security fema i recollect that her eyes
[1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:24.900]  excelled in brightness that of any other animal and that she has no eyelids she may therefore be
[1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:32.980]  esteemed as an emblem of vigilance see eternally awake she never begins an attack so this describes
[1:36:32.980 --> 1:36:40.020]  us this describes me this describes my spirit she never begins an attack nor once engaged
[1:36:41.620 --> 1:36:44.740]  ever surrenders she is therefore an emblem of
[1:36:44.740 --> 1:36:54.420]  of magnanimity and true courage as if anxious to prevent all pretensions of quarreling with her
[1:36:54.420 --> 1:37:00.980]  the weapon which nature has furnished her she conceals in the roof of her mouth so that
[1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:06.820]  to those who are unacquainted with her she appears to be most defenseless animal and even
[1:37:06.820 --> 1:37:13.300]  when those weapons are shown and extended for her defense they appear weak and contemptible
[1:37:13.300 --> 1:37:23.300]  but their wounds however small are decisive and fatal conscience this of this she never wounds
[1:37:23.300 --> 1:37:31.060]  till she has been grievously given notice and generally given notice even to her enemy and
[1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:37.380]  cautioned him against the danger of treading on her was i wrong sir in thinking that a strong
[1:37:37.380 --> 1:37:44.020]  pitcher of the temper of the conduct of america and that's what the gadston flag is for all you
[1:37:44.020 --> 1:37:50.340]  sickening degenerate traders i was wearing one out in la and people were shrinking in fear because
[1:37:50.340 --> 1:37:55.700]  i guess they'd seen her on the news and asking what it was and and and and and who what's the shirt
[1:37:57.780 --> 1:38:03.380]  freedom all right i'm going to shut up now and go back gary francey william louis you have the floor
[1:38:03.380 --> 1:38:11.140]  your points about your new film camp fema you know the the film itself alex um
[1:38:11.700 --> 1:38:16.340]  there's a there's a segment on there chuck boblin talking about the biac report
[1:38:16.340 --> 1:38:21.780]  okay i'm staying there i'm listening to chuck you know this is his we get his feedback on
[1:38:21.780 --> 1:38:27.460]  being labeled a practical terrorist you know that's in the film um you know i sat down with an
[1:38:27.460 --> 1:38:33.860]  interment camp survivor for 60 minutes as he shared his heart-wrenching story of how he had to only
[1:38:33.860 --> 1:38:39.380]  gather up what he could carry with his bare hands and bring into the camp an american citizen
[1:38:40.100 --> 1:38:47.940]  okay you know that's in this in the in the film you know the the evidence is there you know the
[1:38:47.940 --> 1:38:55.060]  pictures are there it's all there alex and it's it's terrifying but it's true the american people
[1:38:55.060 --> 1:39:02.900]  need to see it anyway william take the plug that can't take i think beyond all the legislation that
[1:39:02.900 --> 1:39:08.260]  we're talking about and the mindset and the documentation that we show that are you know
[1:39:08.260 --> 1:39:13.540]  a finite oversight committee hearings and things that you know you can't just prove
[1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:19.300]  all these you know besides all of this evidence that we've gathered up there's there's one thing
[1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:26.420]  we haven't talked about and the best of 2010 census which is coming up this next year no one is
[1:39:26.420 --> 1:39:33.700]  mentioning the fact that in 1940 the government collected census information from the census
[1:39:33.700 --> 1:39:42.020]  bureau and used it to profile american citizens and know whether you were one six percent uh
[1:39:42.020 --> 1:39:47.220]  japanese american and if you were one six percent or higher you were put into one of these interment
[1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:53.540]  camps so they used census information to know who they wanted to lock up we've got a 28 page 2010
[1:39:53.540 --> 1:39:58.500]  census coming out uh this next year and if you don't answer the questions on it they say they're
[1:39:58.500 --> 1:40:03.220]  going to find you up to five thousand dollars for not answering those questions they've got
[1:40:03.220 --> 1:40:07.700]  census takers that are going to have gps trackers that are going to go door to door within 40 feet
[1:40:07.700 --> 1:40:10.820]  of your front door they're going to take a picture it's going to send it up to the satellite they're
[1:40:10.820 --> 1:40:15.780]  going to have gps coordinates to every single front door in america so they're going to know
[1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:21.140]  what you think exactly where you live and now we've got legislation showing that people who
[1:40:21.140 --> 1:40:26.580]  think the way we do are a danger and a threat to society so what's the next step well we're looking
[1:40:26.580 --> 1:40:30.980]  at it the legislation that these things if these camps are setting up this is what they want to do
[1:40:30.980 --> 1:40:35.620]  with the american people and i'm not telling you not to answer any questions but with 2000 census
[1:40:35.620 --> 1:40:39.780]  taker that comes to your door but you know you have you have to be your own judge you have to
[1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:42.660]  decide whether you're going to say there's three people living in this house where you
[1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:47.140]  would sit down and fill out 28-page form that says would you own a firearm or not and by the way
[1:40:47.140 --> 1:40:52.740]  they've already phase one the last year we would tell people this eight nine months ago they didn't
[1:40:52.740 --> 1:40:57.780]  believe us now it's national news they come and mark your front door phase two is now beginning

[1:41:33.060 --> 1:41:40.260]  the door you know the recent information has been revealed to me that they are considering
[1:41:40.260 --> 1:41:46.820]  having a question in the census that says do you own a firearm no no no that is in there that was
[1:41:46.820 --> 1:41:52.420]  in the news in 2000 one of the census forms says do you own firearms no i actually got it

[1:43:13.220 --> 1:43:17.060]  loyal dogged thing was fake and then now they have to admit it's not fake the citizens are mad
[1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:21.380]  at the congressman and how they threw the first few women and men out but then that made everybody
[1:43:21.380 --> 1:43:25.620]  else come out just like they were trying to arrest people putting up the obama posters
[1:43:25.620 --> 1:43:31.060]  but but now they've had to back off they realize that we run this country and if we'll just exercise
[1:43:31.060 --> 1:43:34.660]  it it's over gary francey william louis comments that we're going to calls
[1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:40.580]  alice you know that lady that was demonized by the mainstream media she was demonized because
[1:43:40.580 --> 1:43:45.300]  she stood up and held a birth certificate to our congressman you know what what that did that back
[1:43:45.300 --> 1:43:48.980]  fired on them because when they put that out across the country when they put that out on all the
[1:43:48.980 --> 1:43:54.980]  mainstream media reports they demonize her the good people of america saw that for what it was
[1:43:54.980 --> 1:43:59.780]  and now they're coming out to all the town halls and she was the example to set and now everybody
[1:43:59.780 --> 1:44:05.060]  else is standing up that woman is the american hero that woman is the american hero and everybody
[1:44:05.060 --> 1:44:10.100]  else needs to stand up just like her and then hi and and and that's the key and i want william
[1:44:10.100 --> 1:44:16.580]  to comment on this and we're going to calls from the netherlands and beyond is that i've always
[1:44:16.580 --> 1:44:21.860]  said the last illusion to fall is that we as patriots are a minority and as the people put
[1:44:21.860 --> 1:44:27.220]  up posters and go to town halls and call into radio and go to city council and do all these things
[1:44:27.220 --> 1:44:33.060]  and start websites and and and all this be heard if you're heard by one person that's victory
[1:44:33.060 --> 1:44:38.100]  that now everybody's seeing we're the majority and the system used to try to demonize this
[1:44:38.100 --> 1:44:42.580]  now they're not doing that as much because they realize oh god that only angers them
[1:44:42.580 --> 1:44:50.740]  because the mind control them the mesmerized trance that people were under is breaking william
[1:44:50.740 --> 1:44:58.660]  louis yeah people keep in mind that this country was born out of political dissent you know they
[1:44:58.660 --> 1:45:04.340]  may be labeling george washington and the founders of this country as terrorists but in the crown
[1:45:04.340 --> 1:45:10.580]  side that's what they were in the government side that's what we are it doesn't make us in the wrong
[1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:16.660]  i didn't fact it's it's quite an honor these days to be labeled a potential domestic terrorist
[1:45:16.660 --> 1:45:22.420]  because it says you're standing up and saying the right thing so we can't let them intimidate us
[1:45:22.420 --> 1:45:26.980]  into not saying the things that need to be said and this woman like garry said is a hero we need
[1:45:26.980 --> 1:45:31.940]  to all be standing up we all need to be protesting what's going on in our government and speaking
[1:45:31.940 --> 1:45:39.140]  our minds well i want to say something else than we are going to calls and it's this in 99
[1:45:39.140 --> 1:45:43.700]  percent of the cases and i mean it's literally those type of numbers now when we hear about somebody
[1:45:43.700 --> 1:45:47.700]  putting up an obama poster we hear about somebody going to a town hall or somebody shoots the video
[1:45:47.700 --> 1:45:52.900]  the town hall or cops come over and say you can't have that anti-obama poster but pro posters are
[1:45:52.900 --> 1:45:59.780]  allowed or somebody gets punched in the face and then stands up it's my listeners and i want to tell
[1:45:59.780 --> 1:46:05.940]  the listeners of this show you are the second american revolution against the offshore banks
[1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:14.260]  tyranny and trying to usurp this country you are the only resistance you are wonderful and it is
[1:46:14.260 --> 1:46:20.020]  just such a blessing and such an honor to be able to talk to people like you and to be able to work
[1:46:20.020 --> 1:46:26.260]  with all these other great liberty activists and to be the focal point show and to have media
[1:46:26.260 --> 1:46:32.100]  matters and george soros attacking me every day it is such an honor and i'm trying to live up to
[1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:36.740]  that standard i know i'm not perfect none of us have all the answers but we don't have to be perfect
[1:46:36.740 --> 1:46:42.740]  we just got to take action we know these tyrants are out of control and get the word out gentlemen
[1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:50.660]  now if your listeners are are a crucial crucial part of this entire revolution
[1:46:51.220 --> 1:46:55.140]  you know people are standing up there you know people have seen your films they've seen
[1:46:55.140 --> 1:47:01.860]  russell's film they've you know participated in the ron paul revolution this is the this is the second
[1:47:01.860 --> 1:47:07.540]  american revolution alex i am damn proud to be a part of it i'm damn proud to be on your team
[1:47:07.540 --> 1:47:11.060]  and if somebody wants to come out and demonize me because i stand up for what's right
[1:47:11.060 --> 1:47:15.060]  and for the constitution i say bring it i said bring it with full force because you know what
[1:47:15.060 --> 1:47:19.860]  that's why you're gonna galvanize me to step up you're gonna galvanize the people to step up
[1:47:19.860 --> 1:47:25.300]  and that's what is that's what's happening right now god bless america and absolutely and that's
[1:47:25.300 --> 1:47:30.820]  what's happening is people are realizing they have power the system when it attacks myself
[1:47:30.820 --> 1:47:36.900]  and ron paul and only a few other people nationally now that shows who the real enemy is that shows
[1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:41.700]  that the whole eye of the new world order is focused into the heart of its own empire
[1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:48.340]  because if it can't keep its slaves in line it fails it falls sam in the netherlands you're on

[1:48:05.140 --> 1:48:09.700]  just say that my ancestor from south africa was probably in the first concentration camp

[1:48:45.620 --> 1:48:50.980]  does look at what uh the russians would do they just lock off whole neighborhoods and don't let
[1:48:50.980 --> 1:48:56.180]  food and stuff in and that's what they're saying under quarantine which they're setting the this
[1:48:56.180 --> 1:49:01.220]  is the excuse for the feds to train locals to accept the lockdowns of cities whether it happens or not
[1:49:01.860 --> 1:49:08.260]  is that that's how they work this that's how this is done whole areas of the world are locked down
[1:49:08.260 --> 1:49:13.300]  and they're admitting they're turning all of america into a giant FEMA camp william louis

[2:04:36.820 --> 2:04:41.780]  in abc news that murk quote has hit teams that quote seek and destroy doctors and scientists
[2:04:41.780 --> 2:04:48.180]  that expose them and murk says oh that's just a joke in our internal corporate minutes man this

[2:08:01.380 --> 2:08:07.620]  the genesis communications radio network probably presents the alex jones show because there's a
[2:08:07.620 --> 2:08:17.860]  war on for your mind well the eighth anniversary of the tragic stage terror attacks of 9-11 is
[2:08:17.860 --> 2:08:22.180]  approaching the eighth anniversary i would just remind people that we recall conspiracy theorist
[2:08:22.900 --> 2:08:26.980]  just three years ago for saying the Gulf of Tonkin was staged it's now declassified that
[2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:32.740]  those were staged attacks on our ships to blame it uh on the vietnamese to start the vietnam war
[2:08:32.740 --> 2:08:36.740]  that killed over a million and a half vietnamese and over 58 000 americans injuring over 200 000
[2:08:36.740 --> 2:08:41.300]  americans i just want to point out operation ajax stage terror attacks that were blamed on the
[2:08:41.300 --> 2:08:47.940]  government i ran is declassified at the cia zone history section i just want to point out that it's
[2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:53.060]  now been declassified by the nsa that the uss liberty attack was staged to be blamed on egypt
[2:08:53.860 --> 2:08:58.900]  that came out years after many people exposed it long before i was on the scene it was exposed
[2:08:58.900 --> 2:09:04.100]  20 something 30 years ago well that happened in 67 it was exposed from day one that's now come out
[2:09:04.100 --> 2:09:09.700]  now operation north woods has been declassified the us government planned to bomb us cities and
[2:09:09.700 --> 2:09:17.700]  crash jets and blame it on foreign enemies that's been declassified and army field manual from 2004
[2:09:17.700 --> 2:09:23.300]  has been declassified we're talking about a stage false flag terror attacks it's come out that six
[2:09:23.300 --> 2:09:27.300]  of the 10 9 11 commission members even told the washington post the 9 11 commission was a fraud
[2:09:27.300 --> 2:09:31.380]  and a lie and a cover-up needed to be criminally investigated it's even been in the news but never
[2:09:31.380 --> 2:09:37.780]  gets any traction never becomes a big issue we can't just sit here idly by and let all this
[2:09:37.780 --> 2:09:43.300]  continue so my point is you're crazy to not know about the history government sponsored terror
[2:09:43.300 --> 2:09:52.100]  you're crazy to not know about all the cases out there where hitler firebombed his own Reichstag
[2:09:52.100 --> 2:09:57.620]  in 33 out February 27th to get police state going in germany or how Stalin stage terror attacks or
[2:09:57.620 --> 2:10:01.380]  how the czarist one of their favorite tactics was to stage terror attacks and blaming on their
[2:10:01.380 --> 2:10:06.580]  enemies or how british intelligence has now been declassified and caught staging many of the ira
[2:10:06.580 --> 2:10:13.380]  bombing some were real or haritz and drizzle and post admit that quote israel headline created fake
[2:10:13.380 --> 2:10:18.660]  al-qaeda groups every time there was about to be a peace deal there is of course real terrorism in
[2:10:18.660 --> 2:10:23.300]  israel going on and it's terrible but the point is israeli papers admit the government's been caught
[2:10:23.300 --> 2:10:29.300]  staging and at key points that's what we're talking about here and then you look at the science
[2:10:29.300 --> 2:10:33.140]  the establishment likes to these hit pieces on the science because they know the general public
[2:10:33.140 --> 2:10:38.340]  aren't architects or engineers or physicists or uh underwriting laboratories people like
[2:10:38.340 --> 2:10:42.580]  kevin ryan they can put shoot a missile into a chicken coop and say it would have blown the
[2:10:42.580 --> 2:10:47.300]  pentagon up they can show you a three-story building and say if we would have blown it up we
[2:10:47.300 --> 2:10:52.340]  would have found debt court uh i mean they can do so many little things little gimmicks or say
[2:10:52.340 --> 2:10:59.300]  we're crazy and just want to believe this when the history that we have is a continual chain of
[2:10:59.300 --> 2:11:05.060]  stage terror attacks now on the charlie sheen issue and we're going to richard gauge this is
[2:11:05.060 --> 2:11:09.140]  less than 24 hours after the media picked us up they picked it up first in the afternoon yesterday
[2:11:09.860 --> 2:11:16.340]  at about four o'clock we saw the first mainstream news stories now 20 hours into this or 21 hours
[2:11:16.340 --> 2:11:22.420]  into this fox news charlie sheen seeks meeting with obama to discuss at 911 cover-up
[2:11:25.620 --> 2:11:30.260]  look at this story out of e entertainment front page charlie sheen the truth her teaches obama
[2:11:30.260 --> 2:11:37.380]  about 9 11 us news and world report charlie sheen joins the truth her 911 conspiracy theory fringe
[2:11:37.380 --> 2:11:43.460]  attack piece la times top of the ticket section top political news breaking charlie sheen demands
[2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:51.940]  obama meeting on 911 cover-up here's another one charlie sheen fantasy 911 truth her grilling of
[2:11:51.940 --> 2:11:59.300]  the president gawker uh i mean it just goes on and on president obama charlie sheen van
[2:11:59.300 --> 2:12:07.460]  jones the 911 truth movement this is out of associated content and it goes on and on uh
[2:12:07.460 --> 2:12:16.980]  here's one i mean it's there's just so many of these a houston chronicle it's just there's
[2:12:16.980 --> 2:12:22.020]  just too many to cover them all very very exciting that's why charlie wrote the letter about a
[2:12:22.020 --> 2:12:26.660]  meeting with the president so that it would become a big issue of him wanting to actually
[2:12:26.660 --> 2:12:30.100]  meet with the president that's what he talked about earlier when he was live on the show
[2:12:30.100 --> 2:12:36.740]  in the tape interview we just aired that's the whole point of what we're doing okay is to get
[2:12:36.740 --> 2:12:41.540]  people look at those 20 points in the 20 questions of the president and it was all charlie's idea
[2:12:41.540 --> 2:12:48.020]  every bit of it uh was done exactly the way he wanted and it was a genius idea even a brilliant
[2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:52.100]  idea even people criticizing him and don't agree with 9 11 truth we're saying was very well written
[2:12:54.900 --> 2:13:00.900]  so it's very exciting let's go to richard gauge richard appreciate you coming on first off the
[2:13:00.900 --> 2:13:08.260]  charlie scene situation uh what's your take on it yeah well we we knew people in the entertainment
[2:13:08.260 --> 2:13:16.580]  world uh in hollywood uh talking about uh 9 11 truth and and charlie began this uh what four
[2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:21.940]  years ago five years ago three three three and a half him three and a half he took so much heat for
[2:13:21.940 --> 2:13:27.620]  this that he had to back off until there was more support at a grassroots level and we've got that
[2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:34.980]  now we've got 830 architects and engineers backing him up saying yes these buildings came down by
[2:13:34.980 --> 2:13:40.020]  explosive control demolition so with all of this support and others of course across the 9 11 truth
[2:13:40.020 --> 2:13:45.780]  movement supporting him he can come out and make a splash now and maybe it's time alex and you've
[2:13:45.780 --> 2:13:52.580]  really uh supported him and given him a vehicle uh for this uh expression of coming out of the
[2:13:52.580 --> 2:13:58.260]  closet again and and and building truth this is what has to happen and then it has to happen with
[2:13:58.260 --> 2:14:04.980]  willy nelson and jessie ventura and others who have kind of squeaked a little bit here and there
[2:14:04.980 --> 2:14:13.380]  but now it's time isn't it well it certainly is my friend so much is going on so much is happening
[2:14:14.020 --> 2:14:20.660]  uh right now let's get into there's several new hit pieces for discovery channel and history
[2:14:20.660 --> 2:14:25.060]  channel and a and e that are being made pbs is making another hit piece the british have made
[2:14:26.100 --> 2:14:31.140]  six in the last year and a half that i know of just absolutely ridiculous uh all of that
[2:14:31.140 --> 2:14:38.180]  is going on and happening and then at the same time uh we have this latest big budget and i was
[2:14:38.180 --> 2:14:45.220]  reading it was funded by dubai uh our foreign country with this really shoddy hour long special
[2:14:45.220 --> 2:14:49.620]  that spends a half of it on our psychology and they played all sorts of little uh tricks with the
[2:14:49.620 --> 2:14:54.740]  camera all sorts of things they did uh the way they always made it your opinion we talked sunday
[2:14:54.740 --> 2:14:59.060]  but i want you to recap and expand on that how you gave them all the evidence all the facts and
[2:14:59.060 --> 2:15:04.660]  they would never allow that to be shown in the show i mean really outrageous but i think it's
[2:15:04.660 --> 2:15:08.820]  backfiring on them and it was made by a famous production house that specializes just in hit
[2:15:08.820 --> 2:15:13.780]  pieces and a quote debunking conspiracy terrorist i mean i've said that they do piece after piece
[2:15:14.660 --> 2:15:19.220]  creative differences who i've refused to be interviewed by the jfk peace in 911 so
[2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:23.700]  break it down for us as an architect as an engineer who's built major structures who
[2:15:23.700 --> 2:15:27.220]  has 800 architects and engineers and thousands of other students who are becoming engineers and
[2:15:27.220 --> 2:15:33.220]  architects on your team at 800 plus and break it down as the founder of architects and engineers
[2:15:33.220 --> 2:15:40.260]  trying to love and truth well we've been speaking all across the country now for three three years
[2:15:41.300 --> 2:15:48.660]  we've had uh over 110 presentations to thousands and thousands of people we've toured uh europe
[2:15:48.660 --> 2:15:57.460]  with with not nine cities in europe and uh next month we're going to uh japan australia and new
[2:15:57.460 --> 2:16:05.300]  zealand or november and we're the the who who the key senator senator yuka hisha fujicha
[2:16:06.100 --> 2:16:13.780]  whose party just won uh the he took over their their government basically it was a minority party
[2:16:13.780 --> 2:16:20.500]  um his this this party is is transforming japan right now it's kind of like the revolution we had
[2:16:20.500 --> 2:16:26.180]  not really the change we had from the democrats to the republican excuse me republican democrats
[2:16:26.180 --> 2:16:33.620]  so he's bringing us to tokyo and kyo tokyo introduced us i mean this is a huge um opportunity
[2:16:33.620 --> 2:16:38.100]  for the 911 truth movement because he himself has been traveling around the world talking
[2:16:38.100 --> 2:16:44.260]  about 911 truth and so we're very excited to to speak in 14 different cities all together
[2:16:44.260 --> 2:16:50.900]  in japan australia and let me just throw a caveat in um as of a year ago when he first went public
[2:16:50.900 --> 2:16:54.180]  and we interviewed him here as well and he's since traveled to new york and other major cities of the
[2:16:54.180 --> 2:17:05.780]  world he was the number three person in his party in the diet now his party for after decades and
[2:17:05.780 --> 2:17:11.620]  decades out of power is now in power and as you said the president of his party is now the president
[2:17:11.620 --> 2:17:16.500]  of the country so we need to go look at the power structure but i believe he's number two now
[2:17:17.220 --> 2:17:23.860]  in the japanese government is a 911 truth or who shows clips and and clips of your films and clips
[2:17:23.860 --> 2:17:30.340]  of professor steven jones repeatedly in the diet in their congress i mean this and this is all over
[2:17:30.340 --> 2:17:39.300]  japanese tv they came and interviewed me many times uh but i mean this is incredible i'm excited
[2:17:39.300 --> 2:17:43.140]  about it too and we get to go there and be right in the middle of it learn a whole lot more about
[2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:50.740]  it in fact uh they're booking the diet itself the the governmental uh body the building we're going
[2:17:50.740 --> 2:17:56.740]  to be speaking there that's the that's the plan at this point not to their government uh but uh
[2:17:56.740 --> 2:18:02.740]  having having the public to come uh to to that place so that's unbelievable so that'd be like
[2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:09.300]  having a huge 911 truth investigation in the house or in the senate yeah yeah exactly i mean that's
[2:18:09.860 --> 2:18:16.580]  that's pretty exciting so we'll try to put something uh very special uh together for that um last
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:25.620]  night i i had the opportunity to speak to a packed house of 200 at the commonwealth club of california
[2:18:25.620 --> 2:18:34.740]  we webcast this live we had 435 people listening live uh also uh from home on their computers and
[2:18:34.740 --> 2:18:41.700]  i had uh 40 minutes to present all of the evidence which by the way i had very carefully laid out
[2:18:41.700 --> 2:18:47.940]  before robert erickson of creative differences who was the producer for this national geographic
[2:18:47.940 --> 2:18:55.940]  uh entertainment piece we call it um uh that most that many people have had the opportunity
[2:18:55.940 --> 2:19:03.620]  to see and uh we'll be talking about uh how they go about uh distorting what we have to say and but
[2:19:03.620 --> 2:19:12.020]  it's very important that people understand that i spent an hour with him highlighting the evidence
[2:19:12.020 --> 2:19:19.940]  of the freefall acceleration of world trade center seven uh you know and in the pools of molten
[2:19:19.940 --> 2:19:27.860]  iron that are found underneath it and the twin towers and uh all of this this evidence a massive
[2:19:27.860 --> 2:19:35.540]  expulsion of perimeter wall sections 600 feet at 70 miles an hour instant acceleration out of the
[2:19:35.540 --> 2:19:41.140]  side of the twin towers no floors found at the bottom of the twin towers pulverized concrete
[2:19:41.140 --> 2:19:46.740]  90 000 tons of it richard we got a break here in about 15 seconds stay there we're gonna come back
[2:19:46.740 --> 2:19:51.220]  because you talked about this sunday but a lot of people didn't hear it about this guy being a big
[2:19:51.220 --> 2:19:56.660]  liar so directly from richard gauge you're gonna hear what happened when we get back after this
[2:19:56.660 --> 2:20:04.660]  quick break stay with us why are you letting that search engine spy on you spy on me yeah don't

[2:22:02.020 --> 2:22:06.660]  in this world the closest i can come to a guarantee is that the dollar is going to zero during the
[2:22:06.660 --> 2:22:12.180]  great hyperinflation in weimar germany people who had worked all their lives invested conservatively
[2:22:12.180 --> 2:22:17.380]  were wiped out reduced to poverty there are many parallels between the weimar and the us today i'll
[2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:22.740]  send you a list there are ways to protect yourself from hyperinflation gold and silver and legal and
[2:22:22.740 --> 2:22:28.660]  constitutional ways to avoid confiscation which is becoming highly probable i'm bob mos with mitis

[2:22:33.620 --> 2:22:38.820]  to protect themselves there is in fact a financial tsunami coming and it could fall upon us quickly
[2:22:38.820 --> 2:22:43.940]  with little warning don't procrastinate protect yourself call me today bob mos at eight hundred

[2:23:07.860 --> 2:23:10.660]  is dominating by a powerful world government.
[2:23:10.660 --> 2:23:13.460]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[2:23:13.460 --> 2:23:16.260]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[2:23:16.260 --> 2:23:19.340]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:23:19.340 --> 2:23:22.300]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[2:23:22.300 --> 2:23:26.180]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[2:23:26.180 --> 2:23:27.020]  is at hand.
[2:23:29.820 --> 2:23:31.540]  For the first time in history,
[2:23:31.540 --> 2:23:35.220]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:23:35.220 --> 2:23:36.900]  You will learn the secret that drives
[2:23:36.900 --> 2:23:39.020]  the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:23:39.020 --> 2:23:40.620]  Builder Bird is making great progress
[2:23:40.620 --> 2:23:41.580]  toward a world government.
[2:23:41.580 --> 2:23:43.540]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[2:23:43.540 --> 2:23:44.820]  They have all the money they need.
[2:23:44.820 --> 2:23:45.780]  They're after power.
[2:23:45.780 --> 2:23:46.860]  That's their app to use you.

[2:23:58.420 --> 2:23:59.860]  You have been warned.
[2:24:01.940 --> 2:24:06.060]  Well, you were sleeping.
[2:24:06.060 --> 2:24:07.580]  They came and took it all away.
[2:24:07.580 --> 2:24:10.860]  They came and took it all away.
[2:24:13.740 --> 2:24:17.900]  The names and the middle.
[2:24:17.900 --> 2:24:19.420]  Look at all these articles for people watching at
[2:24:19.420 --> 2:24:21.260]  prisonplanet.tv.
[2:24:21.260 --> 2:24:33.500]  LA Times, Fox News, Reuters, Houston Chronicle,
[2:24:33.500 --> 2:24:35.620]  breaking Charlie Sheen demands Obama meeting
[2:24:35.620 --> 2:24:38.540]  on the 9-1-1 cover-up.
[2:24:38.540 --> 2:24:40.780]  Again, if he just came out for 9-11 Truth again,
[2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:41.700]  it wouldn't be as much attention.
[2:24:41.700 --> 2:24:44.180]  But he comes out and wants to talk to Obama.
[2:24:44.180 --> 2:24:45.620]  It ignites massive debate.
[2:24:45.620 --> 2:24:46.340]  That was his idea.
[2:24:46.340 --> 2:24:49.580]  And it's much bigger than the last time he went public.
[2:24:49.580 --> 2:24:53.420]  24 hours into this, it is just exploding.
[2:24:53.420 --> 2:24:54.260]  Very, very exciting.
[2:24:54.260 --> 2:24:57.060]  Going back to Richard Gage, because I have this article
[2:24:57.060 --> 2:24:57.540]  here, Richard.
[2:24:57.540 --> 2:24:58.900]  I want to get back into the science.
[2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:00.660]  And this guy's saying, promising you
[2:25:00.660 --> 2:25:04.700]  if he put your science and your evidence in the film,
[2:25:04.700 --> 2:25:07.660]  and even showing you a rough cut that did have it,
[2:25:07.660 --> 2:25:10.140]  and saying that was the cut.
[2:25:10.140 --> 2:25:12.140]  But have you seen where the federal government is
[2:25:12.140 --> 2:25:13.860]  going to indoctrinate kids on 9-11,
[2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:15.940]  and how the police state and patriot act are good,
[2:25:15.940 --> 2:25:20.060]  as part of 9-11 federally funded courses
[2:25:20.060 --> 2:25:21.500]  in the public schools?
[2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:23.420]  No, I'm not aware of that, Alex.
[2:25:23.420 --> 2:25:24.740]  Now, we're going to cover that later.
[2:25:24.740 --> 2:25:25.820]  Well, continue.
[2:25:25.820 --> 2:25:27.980]  So recap.
[2:25:27.980 --> 2:25:30.060]  Creative differences, the production company
[2:25:30.060 --> 2:25:33.500]  that did the piece for National Geographic TV, the hit piece.
[2:25:33.500 --> 2:25:34.900]  They first, they said it wasn't a hit piece.
[2:25:34.900 --> 2:25:35.820]  It was going to be fair.
[2:25:35.820 --> 2:25:37.180]  They promised they'd show your science.
[2:25:37.180 --> 2:25:38.380]  Continue.
[2:25:38.380 --> 2:25:41.020]  Well, yeah, they brought us down for the first interview.
[2:25:41.020 --> 2:25:43.340]  And I just mentioned before the break
[2:25:43.340 --> 2:25:47.580]  that we carefully lay out all of this information for them.
[2:25:47.580 --> 2:25:49.940]  And they're asking very intelligent questions.
[2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:50.660]  And they're nodding.
[2:25:50.660 --> 2:25:54.700]  And he was aware that we were telling the truth,
[2:25:54.700 --> 2:25:56.300]  and he was very impressed by it.
[2:25:56.300 --> 2:25:57.580]  I have to tell you that.
[2:25:57.580 --> 2:25:59.980]  This guy knows what's going on.
[2:25:59.980 --> 2:26:03.340]  This is not some kind of unconscious skepticism.
[2:26:03.340 --> 2:26:04.780]  Or something.
[2:26:04.780 --> 2:26:10.740]  So four months later, we're invited back
[2:26:10.740 --> 2:26:14.900]  because he wants to show us the rough cut.
[2:26:14.900 --> 2:26:19.420]  Because he has had criticism in the past where he felt.
[2:26:19.420 --> 2:26:23.740]  He said people have thought that their interviews were
[2:26:23.740 --> 2:26:26.140]  taken out of context and so forth.
[2:26:26.140 --> 2:26:27.740]  So he brings us back.
[2:26:27.740 --> 2:26:31.740]  And actually, I'm watching myself in the rough cut
[2:26:31.740 --> 2:26:33.500]  with all this evidence.
[2:26:33.500 --> 2:26:37.580]  And I'm delighted because we're talking about molten metal.
[2:26:37.580 --> 2:26:41.740]  We're talking about nanothermite chips found in the dust,
[2:26:41.740 --> 2:26:44.900]  very high-tech stuff, not made in a cave in Afghanistan.
[2:26:44.900 --> 2:26:48.420]  I think your next hour's guest, Stephen Jones,
[2:26:48.420 --> 2:26:50.820]  will be talking in detail about that.
[2:26:50.820 --> 2:26:55.780]  But I told him about the small, previously molten iron
[2:26:55.780 --> 2:26:58.220]  spheres, the size of a human hair that
[2:26:58.220 --> 2:26:59.620]  are found in all the dust samples,
[2:26:59.620 --> 2:27:01.900]  ignited thermite, by chemical analysis.
[2:27:01.900 --> 2:27:04.660]  Anyway, all of us was in there.
[2:27:04.660 --> 2:27:08.340]  And we're delighted, right?
[2:27:08.340 --> 2:27:11.220]  And then he brings out these experiments
[2:27:11.220 --> 2:27:12.260]  that he's done.
[2:27:12.260 --> 2:27:17.540]  Emertek, who's really nothing more than a defense contractor
[2:27:17.540 --> 2:27:18.620]  at New Mexico.
[2:27:18.620 --> 2:27:22.500]  Because they're like Lawrence Livermore Lab or something.
[2:27:22.500 --> 2:27:25.060]  All of their money comes from defense.
[2:27:25.060 --> 2:27:26.780]  They're on the government payroll.
[2:27:26.780 --> 2:27:27.940]  That's for sure.
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:30.020]  And so they have these three experiments
[2:27:30.020 --> 2:27:32.780]  that they never talked to us that what experiments they
[2:27:32.780 --> 2:27:38.180]  might be doing, what they didn't get our input at all.
[2:27:38.180 --> 2:27:39.940]  It's just we're just watching these experiments.
[2:27:39.940 --> 2:27:42.700]  So they lure you back to see the rough cut.
[2:27:42.700 --> 2:27:44.860]  And it's these experiments.
[2:27:44.860 --> 2:27:46.260]  Yeah, then we see the rough cut.
[2:27:46.260 --> 2:27:49.140]  And we're delighted with what we were shown of ourselves.
[2:27:49.140 --> 2:27:51.020]  And then these experiments come on.
[2:27:51.020 --> 2:27:52.980]  And we're going, what the heck is this?
[2:27:52.980 --> 2:27:55.380]  Because we're looking at it.
[2:27:55.380 --> 2:27:57.460]  And by the way, they're videotaping your response.
[2:27:57.460 --> 2:27:58.500]  They're like, come see the rough cut.
[2:27:58.500 --> 2:27:59.420]  Now come in here.
[2:27:59.420 --> 2:28:01.460]  We want to show you some other clips.
[2:28:01.460 --> 2:28:02.660]  I mean, is that how this happened?
[2:28:02.660 --> 2:28:04.300]  And then really they're videotaping you?
[2:28:04.300 --> 2:28:04.800]  Yes.
[2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:09.060]  And the intent was not that they were going to use our responses
[2:28:09.060 --> 2:28:11.860]  in the final version.
[2:28:11.860 --> 2:28:15.780]  The intent was that, what did he say?
[2:28:15.780 --> 2:28:17.420]  We just want a record that you're
[2:28:17.420 --> 2:28:19.820]  happy with what you saw, basically.
[2:28:19.820 --> 2:28:22.340]  So this was a manipulation, clearly.
[2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:26.420]  And I have to tell you, this thermite experiment,
[2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:28.620]  for instance, where they, excuse me,
[2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:33.100]  the beam, where they put this 8-inch tall eye
[2:28:33.100 --> 2:28:39.180]  beam across 500 gallons of jet fuel and light it,
[2:28:39.180 --> 2:28:43.860]  and put a 3,000-pound load in the middle of this eye beam.
[2:28:43.860 --> 2:28:46.940]  And we have, in a couple of minutes,
[2:28:46.940 --> 2:28:51.780]  temperatures rising very high and causing
[2:28:51.780 --> 2:28:53.700]  the failure of this beam.
[2:28:53.700 --> 2:28:56.620]  Well, first of all, had they talked to us,
[2:28:56.620 --> 2:28:58.180]  and even if they didn't talk to us,
[2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:02.260]  they should have known that a NIST, in their investigation,
[2:29:02.260 --> 2:29:05.820]  hired underwriter laboratories to develop
[2:29:05.820 --> 2:29:09.300]  an exact replica of the floor trust system
[2:29:09.300 --> 2:29:14.420]  with a composite deck of concrete and metal decking.
[2:29:14.420 --> 2:29:17.340]  And they had, under laboratory conditions,
[2:29:17.340 --> 2:29:21.580]  ASTM E119 is the test number.
[2:29:21.580 --> 2:29:24.980]  They put 2,000 degrees of fire under the trust
[2:29:24.980 --> 2:29:26.900]  and twice the known amount of loading
[2:29:26.900 --> 2:29:29.620]  on top of the floor system.
[2:29:29.620 --> 2:29:30.220]  Stay there.
[2:29:30.220 --> 2:29:31.100]  This is scientific.
[2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:32.300]  I don't want to interrupt this.
[2:29:32.300 --> 2:29:35.060]  Yes, the underwriting laboratories found it wouldn't happen.
[2:29:35.060 --> 2:29:38.060]  But see, one of their members goes public releasing
[2:29:38.060 --> 2:29:39.540]  their report, they fire him.
[2:29:39.540 --> 2:29:40.300]  That's Kevin Ryan.
[2:29:40.300 --> 2:29:41.740]  Stay there.
[2:29:41.740 --> 2:29:43.660]  We're going to come right back with architect and engineer
[2:29:43.660 --> 2:29:45.580]  Richard Gage.
[2:29:45.580 --> 2:29:47.300]  Just powerful information.
[2:29:47.300 --> 2:29:47.860]  Stay with us.
[2:29:47.860 --> 2:29:52.980]  We're on the march.
[2:29:52.980 --> 2:29:55.420]  The empire's on the run.
[2:29:55.420 --> 2:29:58.220]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:01.020 --> 2:30:01.700]  Hello, friends.
[2:30:01.700 --> 2:30:02.660]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:30:02.660 --> 2:30:05.260]  And I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[2:30:05.260 --> 2:30:07.220]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:07.220 --> 2:30:10.940]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:13.700]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants
[2:30:13.700 --> 2:30:15.700]  are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:15.700 --> 2:30:18.220]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[2:30:18.220 --> 2:30:21.260]  reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:21.260 --> 2:30:23.180]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:30:23.180 --> 2:30:25.660]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator
[2:30:25.660 --> 2:30:28.300]  is a low-cost way to take back control of you
[2:30:28.300 --> 2:30:29.700]  and your family's drinking water.
[2:30:29.700 --> 2:30:32.820]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water
[2:30:32.820 --> 2:30:34.500]  from the humidity in the atmosphere
[2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:37.180]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse
[2:30:37.180 --> 2:30:40.740]  osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[2:30:40.740 --> 2:30:44.020]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.

[2:31:01.020 --> 2:31:03.100]  The illusion created by the power elite
[2:31:03.100 --> 2:31:06.340]  is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[2:31:06.340 --> 2:31:08.380]  Will you continue to be their profit center,
[2:31:08.380 --> 2:31:10.860]  buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[2:31:10.860 --> 2:31:13.100]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[2:31:13.100 --> 2:31:14.740]  You don't have to cooperate.
[2:31:14.740 --> 2:31:15.980]  There is a solution.
[2:31:15.980 --> 2:31:17.540]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company
[2:31:17.540 --> 2:31:19.300]  that my wife and I just love, have
[2:31:19.300 --> 2:31:22.100]  been providing products for the last five years that

[2:31:35.460 --> 2:31:37.860]  from our friend Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.
[2:31:37.860 --> 2:31:40.780]  I love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee,
[2:31:40.780 --> 2:31:43.900]  infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[2:32:38.580 --> 2:32:40.740]  about one penny for each one you grow.
[2:32:40.740 --> 2:32:43.700]  And in this economy, saving money is always welcome,
[2:32:43.700 --> 2:32:46.100]  especially when it comes to our food supply.

[2:33:00.500 --> 2:33:13.500]  I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride,
[2:33:13.500 --> 2:33:18.500]  with sword and pistol by my side.
[2:33:18.500 --> 2:33:24.500]  Many a young man lost her bobbles to my trade.
[2:33:24.500 --> 2:33:30.500]  Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade.
[2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:35.500]  The master tongue me in the spring of 25.
[2:33:35.500 --> 2:33:38.500]  But I am still alive.
[2:33:38.500 --> 2:33:41.500]  OK, Richard Gage, architect and engineer
[2:33:41.500 --> 2:33:44.500]  for 9-Eleven Truth Founder.
[2:33:44.500 --> 2:33:46.500]  We got broken up by a couple of breaks there.
[2:33:46.500 --> 2:33:51.500]  Recap what happened with the production company,
[2:33:51.500 --> 2:33:54.500]  with the television piece that just aired last week
[2:33:54.500 --> 2:33:59.500]  on the National Geographic Channel,
[2:33:59.500 --> 2:34:03.500]  and then conclude and summary exactly what you're saying here,
[2:34:03.500 --> 2:34:07.500]  and then I have the question to ask after you're done.
[2:34:07.500 --> 2:34:13.500]  OK, so we have missed hiring underwriter laboratories
[2:34:13.500 --> 2:34:17.500]  to create this mock section, and they tested it,
[2:34:17.500 --> 2:34:22.500]  according to very scientific, well-time-honored tests,
[2:34:22.500 --> 2:34:24.500]  and it did not fail.
[2:34:24.500 --> 2:34:26.500]  They had three different versions of this thing.
[2:34:26.500 --> 2:34:28.500]  It sagged only three inches.
[2:34:28.500 --> 2:34:30.500]  It didn't fail.
[2:34:30.500 --> 2:34:32.500]  NIST, of course, in turn, threw that test out,
[2:34:32.500 --> 2:34:35.500]  and claims a 42-inch sag, by the way,
[2:34:35.500 --> 2:34:38.500]  to justify their column failure theory,
[2:34:38.500 --> 2:34:43.500]  which they needed in order to get Larry Silverstein
[2:34:43.500 --> 2:34:46.500]  his $5.68 billion.
[2:34:46.500 --> 2:34:51.500]  The point is that instead of doing something scientific
[2:34:51.500 --> 2:34:54.500]  like this, we have National Geographic,
[2:34:54.500 --> 2:34:56.500]  Robert Erickson of Creative Differences,
[2:34:56.500 --> 2:34:59.500]  hiring Emertek, a defense contractor,
[2:34:59.500 --> 2:35:02.500]  to show everybody, theoretically,
[2:35:02.500 --> 2:35:08.500]  how this building obviously fell apart.
[2:35:08.500 --> 2:35:12.500]  Well, first of all, they don't have 8-inch I-beams
[2:35:12.500 --> 2:35:13.500]  in the building.
[2:35:13.500 --> 2:35:15.500]  They have floor trusses.
[2:35:15.500 --> 2:35:18.500]  And it certainly doesn't relate to any other massive
[2:35:18.500 --> 2:35:20.500]  core columns in the building.
[2:35:20.500 --> 2:35:23.500]  We didn't have 500 gallons of jet fuel sitting there
[2:35:23.500 --> 2:35:25.500]  underneath anything.
[2:35:25.500 --> 2:35:27.500]  90% of that jet fuel was expelled
[2:35:27.500 --> 2:35:29.500]  and exploded outside the building.
[2:35:29.500 --> 2:35:31.500]  The rest burned up, according to the official story,
[2:35:31.500 --> 2:35:32.500]  in just 10 minutes.
[2:35:32.500 --> 2:35:36.500]  So all the jet fuel did was ignite a normal office fire.
[2:35:36.500 --> 2:35:39.500]  Those temperatures don't get to be above 12 or 1,400 degrees.
[2:35:39.500 --> 2:35:42.500]  And even then, there's no evidence
[2:35:42.500 --> 2:35:47.500]  for temperatures over 500 or 600 degrees in the towers.
[2:35:47.500 --> 2:35:50.500]  So this whole thing from start to finish is just ludicrous.
[2:35:50.500 --> 2:35:53.500]  And this, by the way, this I-beam is not interconnected
[2:35:53.500 --> 2:35:57.500]  with several other beams, like in a normal office building
[2:35:57.500 --> 2:36:01.500]  where the heat is conducted away from the heat source
[2:36:01.500 --> 2:36:04.500]  throughout the columns and beams in the building,
[2:36:04.500 --> 2:36:06.500]  which is really the reason why we never have had
[2:36:06.500 --> 2:36:10.500]  a steel frame, high-rise building collapse due to fire
[2:36:10.500 --> 2:36:13.500]  because of this incredible conduction ability
[2:36:13.500 --> 2:36:14.500]  and interconnectedness.
[2:36:14.500 --> 2:36:16.500]  It's a huge heat sink.
[2:36:16.500 --> 2:36:21.500]  So this experiment and the other ones were set up to fail
[2:36:21.500 --> 2:36:27.500]  and manipulate the American people into thinking
[2:36:27.500 --> 2:36:31.500]  that this was science versus, obviously,
[2:36:31.500 --> 2:36:35.500]  these architects and engineers who were simply conspiracy theorists.
[2:36:35.500 --> 2:36:38.500]  But last night at the Commonwealth Club,
[2:36:38.500 --> 2:36:41.500]  we carefully laid out all this evidence,
[2:36:41.500 --> 2:36:44.500]  and he said, OK, at the end, which side is conspiracy
[2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:46.500]  and which side is science?
[2:36:46.500 --> 2:36:47.500]  So we have a show of hands.
[2:36:47.500 --> 2:36:48.500]  Guess what?
[2:36:48.500 --> 2:36:53.500]  90% of the 60 people who were either believers
[2:36:53.500 --> 2:36:56.500]  of the official theory beforehand or who were unsure,
[2:36:56.500 --> 2:37:01.500]  90% of those 60 people were convinced of the evidence
[2:37:01.500 --> 2:37:02.500]  for explosive control.
[2:37:02.500 --> 2:37:06.500]  OK, to be clear, you've got 200 people at this meeting.
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:09.500]  I guess you asked before, who believes the official story?
[2:37:09.500 --> 2:37:10.500]  Who doesn't?
[2:37:10.500 --> 2:37:12.500]  You're saying that's how you know it was 60 people?
[2:37:12.500 --> 2:37:13.500]  That's right.
[2:37:13.500 --> 2:37:17.500]  OK, so they raise their hands, 60 saying,
[2:37:17.500 --> 2:37:19.500]  I believe the official story that 19 guys
[2:37:19.500 --> 2:37:21.500]  coordinated from caves in Afghanistan did this.
[2:37:21.500 --> 2:37:23.500]  OK, great.
[2:37:23.500 --> 2:37:27.500]  And then at the end of it, you're saying 90% of those 60 people
[2:37:27.500 --> 2:37:31.500]  now believe the engineering, now believe your information.
[2:37:31.500 --> 2:37:33.500]  Yes, and the numbers are 20 and 40,
[2:37:33.500 --> 2:37:35.500]  so that there's 20 people believing the official story
[2:37:35.500 --> 2:37:40.500]  and 40 who were unsure, but 90% of those totaling 60
[2:37:40.500 --> 2:37:43.500]  believed in the explosive control demolition theory
[2:37:43.500 --> 2:37:44.500]  afterward.
[2:37:44.500 --> 2:37:47.500]  And it's like that at every presentation, Alex, 90%.
[2:37:47.500 --> 2:37:49.500]  And you get most of these presentations,
[2:37:49.500 --> 2:37:53.500]  correct me if I'm wrong, two architects and engineer groups.
[2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:55.500]  Well, not mostly.
[2:37:55.500 --> 2:37:58.500]  No, we do visit local architecture and engineering groups
[2:37:58.500 --> 2:37:59.500]  and generally we get orders.
[2:37:59.500 --> 2:38:00.500]  Well, that's what I meant.
[2:38:00.500 --> 2:38:02.500]  You said you've made a whole mission out of,
[2:38:02.500 --> 2:38:05.500]  I mean, how many architects and engineer groups have you talked to?
[2:38:05.500 --> 2:38:08.500]  There's been about a dozen now.
[2:38:08.500 --> 2:38:11.500]  OK, well, what happens when you go to those?
[2:38:11.500 --> 2:38:14.500]  Oh, it's fascinating because you get people who,
[2:38:14.500 --> 2:38:17.500]  first of all, most of them know nothing about
[2:38:17.500 --> 2:38:20.500]  the third worst structural failure in modern history,
[2:38:20.500 --> 2:38:23.500]  building seven 47-story skyscraper collapses
[2:38:23.500 --> 2:38:27.500]  to its own footprint in six and a half seconds
[2:38:27.500 --> 2:38:28.500]  and their jaws drop.
[2:38:28.500 --> 2:38:32.500]  And by the way, NIST had always said freefall didn't happen,
[2:38:32.500 --> 2:38:35.500]  but then they were forced now to go ahead and say,
[2:38:35.500 --> 2:38:36.500]  OK, there was freefall involved.
[2:38:36.500 --> 2:38:38.500]  And they've given five, six different stories
[2:38:38.500 --> 2:38:41.500]  and had to recant their previous reasons
[2:38:41.500 --> 2:38:43.500]  that building seven collapsed in their own NIST reports.
[2:38:43.500 --> 2:38:44.500]  I'd like you to speak to that.
[2:38:44.500 --> 2:38:50.500]  And even National Geographic on the eve of this newest hit piece
[2:38:50.500 --> 2:38:54.500]  said, oh, our last reasons for the towers collapsing with pancake,
[2:38:54.500 --> 2:38:57.500]  we were wrong about that, but now we've got a new idea.
[2:38:57.500 --> 2:38:59.500]  So they're the one, because they say in the piece,
[2:38:59.500 --> 2:39:00.500]  their story's never changed.
[2:39:00.500 --> 2:39:02.500]  The government's story's never changed.
[2:39:02.500 --> 2:39:04.500]  But in truth, their story continually changes.
[2:39:04.500 --> 2:39:05.500]  Oh, yeah.
[2:39:05.500 --> 2:39:07.500]  Yeah, it's always changing.
[2:39:07.500 --> 2:39:09.500]  In fact, they wouldn't have changed
[2:39:09.500 --> 2:39:12.500]  if it weren't for members of A. E. L. M. Truth,
[2:39:12.500 --> 2:39:15.500]  David Chandler, a physicist, and Stephen Jones
[2:39:15.500 --> 2:39:18.500]  calling them publicly on their press conference.
[2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:20.500]  And they had to.
[2:39:20.500 --> 2:39:22.500]  They were forced into a corner.
[2:39:22.500 --> 2:39:25.500]  Now they have to admit that the 100 feet of this building,
[2:39:25.500 --> 2:39:28.500]  its drop, was in freefall.
[2:39:28.500 --> 2:39:31.500]  That's crushing 40,000 tons of structural steel
[2:39:31.500 --> 2:39:34.500]  at the same rate that a brick is falling off the building.
[2:39:34.500 --> 2:39:36.500]  It can't happen.
[2:39:36.500 --> 2:39:38.500]  And everybody knows that.
[2:39:38.500 --> 2:39:40.500]  And every architect engineer we talk to knows that.
[2:39:40.500 --> 2:39:42.500]  So they end up signing our petition saying,
[2:39:42.500 --> 2:39:44.500]  yeah, let's get a real investigation.
[2:39:44.500 --> 2:39:45.500]  OK, I want to go back for a moment,
[2:39:45.500 --> 2:39:48.500]  and we'll continue going over this, debunking them.
[2:39:48.500 --> 2:39:50.500]  The maker of the television show,
[2:39:50.500 --> 2:39:51.500]  who I've talked to on the phone,
[2:39:51.500 --> 2:39:53.500]  he's always trying to get me involved in these shows,
[2:39:53.500 --> 2:39:55.500]  several shows, JFK and 9-11.
[2:39:55.500 --> 2:39:57.500]  And I tell this production company,
[2:39:57.500 --> 2:39:59.500]  no, I know you're deceptive.
[2:39:59.500 --> 2:40:01.500]  You're known as the most manipulative out there,
[2:40:01.500 --> 2:40:02.500]  that this is your specialty.
[2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:04.500]  And the guy laughs, I'm your friend.
[2:40:04.500 --> 2:40:06.500]  No, I want to show your side.
[2:40:06.500 --> 2:40:07.500]  And the JFK thing comes out.
[2:40:07.500 --> 2:40:09.500]  It's a total fraud.
[2:40:09.500 --> 2:40:12.500]  The most skewed to the official story I've ever seen.
[2:40:12.500 --> 2:40:14.500]  And so that's why when I was warning you,
[2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:16.500]  I was saying, Richard, this is months ago,
[2:40:16.500 --> 2:40:18.500]  when you were doing the interviews,
[2:40:18.500 --> 2:40:20.500]  I said, this is not a friendly piece.
[2:40:20.500 --> 2:40:21.500]  And you said, no, he's listening.
[2:40:21.500 --> 2:40:22.500]  He says it's going to be in there.
[2:40:22.500 --> 2:40:23.500]  He promises.
[2:40:23.500 --> 2:40:26.500]  Have you talked to him, which you now say,
[2:40:26.500 --> 2:40:29.500]  that you clearly, that he lied to you?
[2:40:29.500 --> 2:40:30.500]  The question here is,
[2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:32.500]  are you going to put a public statement out on him?
[2:40:32.500 --> 2:40:34.500]  Are you going to, have you called him?
[2:40:34.500 --> 2:40:36.500]  Have you talked to him?
[2:40:36.500 --> 2:40:41.500]  Interestingly enough, he has sent us the transcript
[2:40:41.500 --> 2:40:43.500]  for both of these interviews.
[2:40:43.500 --> 2:40:47.500]  So it's clear that we have the evidence
[2:40:47.500 --> 2:40:50.500]  that he had all of the evidence.
[2:40:50.500 --> 2:40:52.500]  You need to post that.
[2:40:52.500 --> 2:40:53.500]  You need to post that.
[2:40:53.500 --> 2:40:55.500]  I think I'd post the whole transcript.
[2:40:55.500 --> 2:40:57.500]  He'll claim you edited it.
[2:40:57.500 --> 2:40:58.500]  I would post that.
[2:40:58.500 --> 2:41:00.500]  And then everybody write about it to show.
[2:41:00.500 --> 2:41:02.500]  He's going, oh, I promised this would be in there.
[2:41:02.500 --> 2:41:04.500]  Oh, I mean, just unbelievable.
[2:41:04.500 --> 2:41:06.500]  Oh, totally.
[2:41:06.500 --> 2:41:08.500]  When are you going to put that out then?
[2:41:08.500 --> 2:41:10.500]  We'll get it out within a week.
[2:41:10.500 --> 2:41:11.500]  Good.
[2:41:11.500 --> 2:41:14.500]  Well, I'm going to be in New York for the whole next week,
[2:41:14.500 --> 2:41:15.500]  by the way.
[2:41:15.500 --> 2:41:17.500]  We'll be at ground zero.
[2:41:17.500 --> 2:41:19.500]  Hopefully you'll be there the morning.
[2:41:19.500 --> 2:41:20.500]  Unfortunately, I can't.
[2:41:20.500 --> 2:41:22.500]  I've got a bunch of stuff I'm working on here
[2:41:22.500 --> 2:41:24.500]  with the Charlie Seen developments.
[2:41:24.500 --> 2:41:25.500]  Yeah.
[2:41:25.500 --> 2:41:26.500]  Yeah.
[2:41:26.500 --> 2:41:27.500]  Well, I'll take your place, Alex.
[2:41:27.500 --> 2:41:29.500]  I'll be out there talking to people.
[2:41:29.500 --> 2:41:30.500]  There'll be a lot of cameras.
[2:41:30.500 --> 2:41:31.500]  Good.
[2:41:31.500 --> 2:41:32.500]  You're a great leader in this fight.
[2:41:32.500 --> 2:41:34.500]  I mean, yeah, no, I'm finishing my film,
[2:41:34.500 --> 2:41:37.500]  Fall of the Republic, in the next week and a half.
[2:41:37.500 --> 2:41:42.500]  And I am working on just absolutely piles of work.
[2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:44.500]  But I would love to be there with you.
[2:41:44.500 --> 2:41:46.500]  Well, I'll be at the two conferences there,
[2:41:46.500 --> 2:41:49.500]  the Second Demand Transparency Conference at St. Mark's
[2:41:49.500 --> 2:41:52.500]  and the Bowery, the 11th and the 12th,
[2:41:52.500 --> 2:41:55.500]  and the Real Change Conference, the 11th and the 12th.
[2:41:55.500 --> 2:41:58.500]  Also, Luke Rikowski, we are a change group
[2:41:58.500 --> 2:42:01.500]  having some great speakers as well.
[2:42:01.500 --> 2:42:04.500]  So I encourage everybody to come out to New York
[2:42:04.500 --> 2:42:10.500]  who can and support us and support these incredible truthers
[2:42:10.500 --> 2:42:15.500]  who have given so much to wake up the American people.
[2:42:15.500 --> 2:42:19.500]  Now, run through some other bullet points of,
[2:42:19.500 --> 2:42:21.500]  I mean, you were trying when we went to break,
[2:42:21.500 --> 2:42:23.500]  also getting into underwriting laboratories,
[2:42:23.500 --> 2:42:25.500]  has this internal report where in the underwriting,
[2:42:25.500 --> 2:42:28.500]  they tested fire making the building fall.
[2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:29.500]  It had to be a special building,
[2:42:29.500 --> 2:42:31.500]  because FEMA and the command centers were there.
[2:42:31.500 --> 2:42:33.500]  They wouldn't even added more strength.
[2:42:33.500 --> 2:42:39.500]  This super building, CIA, Defense Intelligence, IRS, Army, FBI,
[2:42:39.500 --> 2:42:43.500]  I mean, the whole thing is the second biggest CIA compound
[2:42:43.500 --> 2:42:45.500]  outside of Langley in the US, they admit.
[2:42:45.500 --> 2:42:48.500]  And then magically, it falls in its own footprint.
[2:42:48.500 --> 2:42:51.500]  You brought that information about underwriting laboratories to them,
[2:42:51.500 --> 2:42:52.500]  but they don't care.
[2:42:52.500 --> 2:42:55.500]  They went and got a steal of unknown strength and alloy,
[2:42:55.500 --> 2:42:58.500]  put a big weight over it with the white tips of the flame,
[2:42:58.500 --> 2:43:03.500]  the very hottest part, hitting on it long-wise, just amazing.
[2:43:03.500 --> 2:43:08.500]  Yeah, and obviously, it's going to fail.
[2:43:08.500 --> 2:43:12.500]  With 3,000-pound point load right in the center span of the beam,
[2:43:12.500 --> 2:43:15.500]  it's designed to fail.
[2:43:15.500 --> 2:43:16.500]  It's designed to show.
[2:43:16.500 --> 2:43:20.500]  So when it does fail, I can imagine half of the public watching
[2:43:20.500 --> 2:43:23.500]  goes, oh, that's what happened to the World Trade Center.
[2:43:23.500 --> 2:43:26.500]  I see it failing. It's like sheep, you know.
[2:43:26.500 --> 2:43:28.500]  But the fires had almost completely burned out.
[2:43:28.500 --> 2:43:31.500]  There were people in the holes waving for help.
[2:43:31.500 --> 2:43:34.500]  Seconds before, they just shatter, and the building just,
[2:43:34.500 --> 2:43:36.500]  you know, just, it's unbelievable.
[2:43:36.500 --> 2:43:39.500]  Yeah, and it's like watching a volcano explode
[2:43:39.500 --> 2:43:41.500]  and saying there was no pressure underneath it.
[2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:46.500]  In the South Tower, the fires were going out
[2:43:46.500 --> 2:43:49.500]  after only 56 minutes.
[2:43:49.500 --> 2:43:50.500]  According to the Fire Department?
[2:43:50.500 --> 2:43:52.500]  According to the Fire Department.
[2:43:52.500 --> 2:43:55.500]  Yeah, well, the Oriole Palmer had reached the 78th floor
[2:43:55.500 --> 2:43:57.500]  and he says there's two isolated pockets of fire.
[2:43:57.500 --> 2:43:59.500]  We can put it out with two lines.
[2:43:59.500 --> 2:44:06.500]  And 10 minutes later, the 101st responders are witnessing
[2:44:06.500 --> 2:44:09.500]  and documenting in their oral recording sounds of explosions
[2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:13.500]  and flashes of light at the onset of the collapses,
[2:44:13.500 --> 2:44:16.500]  like a belt wrapping all the way around the building.
[2:44:16.500 --> 2:44:20.500]  It was as if they had detonators. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:44:20.500 --> 2:44:23.500]  Yeah, that's a quote from the Fire Department.
[2:44:23.500 --> 2:44:26.500]  And we have news reporters on the ground,
[2:44:26.500 --> 2:44:29.500]  2,000 feet away from this,
[2:44:29.500 --> 2:44:34.500]  ducking from the incredible sounds of explosions,
[2:44:34.500 --> 2:44:38.500]  which we don't hear on any of the reports.
[2:44:38.500 --> 2:44:42.500]  They systematically take out the sounds of explosions,
[2:44:42.500 --> 2:44:48.500]  but there's well over a couple of hundred witnesses
[2:44:48.500 --> 2:44:50.500]  talking about these incredible explosions
[2:44:50.500 --> 2:44:53.500]  and then debris flying everywhere
[2:44:53.500 --> 2:44:55.500]  out of the sides of the Twin Towers.
[2:44:55.500 --> 2:44:59.500]  As I mentioned, 600 feet flying laterally
[2:44:59.500 --> 2:45:02.500]  at 50 to 70 miles an hour.
[2:45:02.500 --> 2:45:06.500]  And so this is a gravitational collapse.
[2:45:06.500 --> 2:45:10.500]  We would expect to see 110 floors stacked up
[2:45:10.500 --> 2:45:12.500]  at the bottom of each of these buildings.
[2:45:12.500 --> 2:45:15.500]  Guess how many floors we see at the bottom?
[2:45:15.500 --> 2:45:18.500]  And it photographs the video. None.
[2:45:18.500 --> 2:45:21.500]  They're all gone. They've been pulverized
[2:45:21.500 --> 2:45:25.500]  and distributed laterally outside the building's footprint.
[2:45:25.500 --> 2:45:27.500]  This is supposed to be a gravitational collapse.
[2:45:27.500 --> 2:45:31.500]  We should have 20 to 40 stories high of floors sitting down there.
[2:45:31.500 --> 2:45:33.500]  Where are they? They're gone.
[2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:37.500]  So this is a huge problem for the official story as well.
[2:45:37.500 --> 2:45:40.500]  Continuum.
[2:45:40.500 --> 2:45:45.500]  So I explained very carefully the National Geographic,
[2:45:45.500 --> 2:45:48.500]  what FEMA found and what FEMA documented
[2:45:48.500 --> 2:45:53.500]  in the Appendix C of the May of 2002 B-PAT report.
[2:45:53.500 --> 2:45:57.500]  Two steel samples, by the way, the only two steel samples
[2:45:57.500 --> 2:45:59.500]  saved from Building 7.
[2:45:59.500 --> 2:46:04.500]  But these two steel samples, they document intergramular melting,
[2:46:04.500 --> 2:46:06.500]  rapid oxidation, sulfidation,
[2:46:06.500 --> 2:46:09.500]  and even evaporation of the ends of these beams.
[2:46:09.500 --> 2:46:12.500]  The environment had never seen this before.
[2:46:12.500 --> 2:46:14.500]  So how did this happen?
[2:46:14.500 --> 2:46:19.500]  And so they conclude, FEMA, that their best hypothesis
[2:46:19.500 --> 2:46:21.500]  as to how this building came down
[2:46:21.500 --> 2:46:24.500]  has only a low probability of occurrence.
[2:46:24.500 --> 2:46:26.500]  Well, what was that hypothesis?
[2:46:26.500 --> 2:46:29.500]  Fire and some damage from the beams
[2:46:29.500 --> 2:46:31.500]  of the World Trade Center North Power
[2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:33.500]  when it went down earlier that morning.
[2:46:33.500 --> 2:46:36.500]  So what happens to this entire...
[2:46:36.500 --> 2:46:39.500]  Oh, this is further research investigation is necessary.
[2:46:39.500 --> 2:46:43.500]  But unfortunately, though, for those hoping to resolve the issue,
[2:46:43.500 --> 2:46:47.500]  all of that steel had been recycled to China,
[2:46:47.500 --> 2:46:51.500]  and FEMA had ordered the recycling of that steel.
[2:46:51.500 --> 2:46:55.500]  They've denied this, but those who do this research
[2:46:55.500 --> 2:47:00.500]  end up citing FEMA for giving these orders.
[2:47:00.500 --> 2:47:02.500]  So they didn't save the steel.
[2:47:02.500 --> 2:47:04.500]  You always save the steel in any kind of a collapse.
[2:47:04.500 --> 2:47:07.500]  So you could thoroughly understand exactly what happened.
[2:47:07.500 --> 2:47:11.500]  Now, this takes over the investigation after May of 2002.
[2:47:11.500 --> 2:47:14.500]  What did they do with this appendix?
[2:47:14.500 --> 2:47:17.500]  See, documenting the melting of steel.
[2:47:17.500 --> 2:47:19.500]  They throw it out.
[2:47:19.500 --> 2:47:23.500]  It is not in the final report at all in World Trade Center 7
[2:47:23.500 --> 2:47:28.500]  that came out in November just last year, seven years later.
[2:47:28.500 --> 2:47:34.500]  So they've basically systematically destroyed even more evidence.
[2:47:34.500 --> 2:47:38.500]  They do not want us to know about molten metal or melting of steel.
[2:47:38.500 --> 2:47:42.500]  In fact, John Gross denies the pools of molten iron,
[2:47:42.500 --> 2:47:44.500]  as it turns out to be.
[2:47:44.500 --> 2:47:46.500]  Stephen Jones and others analyze it.
[2:47:46.500 --> 2:47:48.500]  It turns out to be molten iron.
[2:47:48.500 --> 2:47:51.500]  Can we have all the videos of the firefighters saying it was like a foundry
[2:47:51.500 --> 2:47:53.500]  with molten metal running everywhere?
[2:47:53.500 --> 2:47:57.500]  We can play the clips, but they're cussing, including fire captains.
[2:47:57.500 --> 2:48:00.500]  But, I mean, it was just everywhere.
[2:48:00.500 --> 2:48:01.500]  Yeah, it was.
[2:48:01.500 --> 2:48:04.500]  And there's dozens and dozens of witnesses.
[2:48:04.500 --> 2:48:06.500]  There's photographs.
[2:48:06.500 --> 2:48:10.500]  It's all in my film Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[2:48:10.500 --> 2:48:12.500]  The people really need to get it at infowars.com.
[2:48:12.500 --> 2:48:14.500]  It goes through the whole history of this and the modern events.
[2:48:14.500 --> 2:48:16.500]  And that's how you really wake somebody up.
[2:48:16.500 --> 2:48:17.500]  I understand you're an engineer.
[2:48:17.500 --> 2:48:18.500]  You're an architect.
[2:48:18.500 --> 2:48:20.500]  That's an important area of research.
[2:48:20.500 --> 2:48:23.500]  I was very impressed by Terror Storm.
[2:48:23.500 --> 2:48:27.500]  My point is, though, there's the other angle where we all see the science.
[2:48:27.500 --> 2:48:29.500]  And, well, thank you, Richard.
[2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:32.500]  We go at the history of it, that they've done this over and over again.
[2:48:32.500 --> 2:48:37.500]  And that helps people get past not imagining that government would do this.
[2:48:37.500 --> 2:48:39.500]  Government isn't like the rest of people.
[2:48:39.500 --> 2:48:40.500]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[2:48:40.500 --> 2:48:44.500]  Yeah, it's disturbing because, you know, all of this evidence is clear.
[2:48:44.500 --> 2:48:47.500]  As I mentioned, to 90% of the people I talk to,
[2:48:47.500 --> 2:48:50.500]  they end up agreeing with us and signing our petition.
[2:48:50.500 --> 2:48:53.500]  But they say, well, what do we do now?
[2:48:53.500 --> 2:48:56.500]  You know, and I'm going, well, we're architecture engineers.
[2:48:56.500 --> 2:48:58.500]  We can carry you this far.
[2:48:58.500 --> 2:49:02.500]  We can give you the evidence that the media, the government has not given you.
[2:49:02.500 --> 2:49:08.500]  You can see for yourself that this points to something other than some kind of al-Qaeda attack.
[2:49:08.500 --> 2:49:11.500]  You have got to do the research.
[2:49:11.500 --> 2:49:16.500]  And Terror Storm provides an excellent background as to how these things have been systematic.
[2:49:16.500 --> 2:49:22.500]  As you mentioned earlier with government inciting wars for profit and control.
[2:49:22.500 --> 2:49:27.500]  And they want to know, well, how do we talk to people?
[2:49:27.500 --> 2:49:32.500]  Because this is a psychological problem for every American.
[2:49:32.500 --> 2:49:33.500]  Well, it is.
[2:49:33.500 --> 2:49:35.500]  Richard, we're almost out of time.
[2:49:35.500 --> 2:49:36.500]  I want to finish that last point.
[2:49:36.500 --> 2:49:38.500]  But again, have you talked to the maker?
[2:49:38.500 --> 2:49:39.500]  You've got the transcript.
[2:49:39.500 --> 2:49:41.500]  But have you tried to call the guy and say you lied to me?
[2:49:41.500 --> 2:49:43.500]  Or has he taken your phone calls?
[2:49:43.500 --> 2:49:46.500]  No, he'll talk to me.
[2:49:46.500 --> 2:49:49.500]  We emailed a couple of times.
[2:49:49.500 --> 2:49:53.500]  I have not presented him with a major confrontation at all.
[2:49:53.500 --> 2:49:56.500]  I'm trying to put my ducks in a row.
[2:49:56.500 --> 2:49:58.500]  And now I'm packing up for New York.
[2:49:58.500 --> 2:49:59.500]  It's going to be very difficult.
[2:49:59.500 --> 2:50:00.500]  It's going to take a little bit of time.
[2:50:00.500 --> 2:50:04.500]  I understand next week you're going to get back, focus on it, have a plan, and then come out with it.
[2:50:04.500 --> 2:50:10.500]  Well, I think it's important to see people when they Google the name of this company know who they're dealing with.
[2:50:10.500 --> 2:50:13.500]  And I did some research on was like, no way am I talking to you guys?
[2:50:13.500 --> 2:50:15.500]  Because I've been around similar people.
[2:50:15.500 --> 2:50:19.500]  When I had the history channel people here, I knew it was a hit piece.
[2:50:19.500 --> 2:50:21.500]  But when they were, they said, oh, this is fair.
[2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:22.500]  And we like you at the end.
[2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:24.500]  They just laughed at me in a parking lot.
[2:50:24.500 --> 2:50:26.500]  And I had the British crew say they were being fair.
[2:50:26.500 --> 2:50:33.500]  And at the end, we went to a Chinese food restaurant and they wrote on a fortune cookie as a joke.
[2:50:33.500 --> 2:50:34.500]  They said, here, open this one.
[2:50:34.500 --> 2:50:35.500]  It's yours at PF Changs.
[2:50:35.500 --> 2:50:39.500]  And it said, you're dead with another British crew.
[2:50:39.500 --> 2:50:40.500]  And then I said, is this a joke?
[2:50:40.500 --> 2:50:43.500]  And they said, whatever, we don't like you and got up and left.
[2:50:43.500 --> 2:50:46.500]  I mean, it was just like, they wanted me at the end to know, look, we punked you.
[2:50:46.500 --> 2:50:47.500]  We're nasty.
[2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:49.500]  We're black ops.
[2:50:49.500 --> 2:50:51.500]  And we love the new world order.
[2:50:51.500 --> 2:50:52.500]  It's just basically what it was.
[2:50:52.500 --> 2:50:54.500]  Richard Stahler, I want to say bye to you on the other side.
[2:50:54.500 --> 2:50:55.500]  Plugs of events coming up.
[2:50:55.500 --> 2:50:57.500]  I'm going to get into this world government news.
[2:50:57.500 --> 2:51:01.500]  And Professor Stephen Jones is coming up so much as happy.
[2:51:01.500 --> 2:51:07.500]  When it comes to emergency preparedness, you know it's the responsible thing to do for you and your family.
[2:51:07.500 --> 2:51:12.500]  You also know that preparedness, though a necessity, can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars.
[2:51:12.500 --> 2:51:17.500]  Unfortunately, in these tough economic times, most cannot get ready for emergency situations.
[2:51:17.500 --> 2:51:20.500]  For many, preparedness has been placed on the back burner.
[2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:22.500]  This year has been tough for everyone.
[2:51:22.500 --> 2:51:26.500]  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't have any less of a chance in a crisis.
[2:51:26.500 --> 2:51:29.500]  That's why Ready Reserve is offering wholesale pricing to the public.
[2:51:29.500 --> 2:51:35.500]  When you're ready, give us a call and we'll work with your budget and family size to help you grow your preparedness needs.

[2:52:00.500 --> 2:52:07.500]  It's year after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[2:52:07.500 --> 2:52:09.500]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[2:52:09.500 --> 2:52:17.500]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[2:52:17.500 --> 2:52:25.500]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[2:52:25.500 --> 2:52:28.500]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[2:52:28.500 --> 2:52:37.500]  A White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[2:52:37.500 --> 2:52:41.500]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[2:52:41.500 --> 2:52:43.500]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:52:43.500 --> 2:52:47.500]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[2:53:59.500 --> 2:54:15.500]  U.S. News & World Report has the meanest hit piece I've seen by Peter Roth.
[2:54:15.500 --> 2:54:17.500]  I want to try to get him on.
[2:54:17.500 --> 2:54:19.500]  We have the former German Defense Minister.
[2:54:19.500 --> 2:54:21.500]  We have one of the top people in the Japanese government.
[2:54:21.500 --> 2:54:24.500]  What is he, number two or three?
[2:54:24.500 --> 2:54:35.500]  We have all these scientists, all these engineers, all these physicists, all these military people, all these firefighters and police.
[2:54:35.500 --> 2:54:38.500]  The majority of the victim's family groups, we've had them on the show.
[2:54:38.500 --> 2:54:42.500]  The heads of the group saying the majority of our members, at least half or more, believe it's an inside job.
[2:54:42.500 --> 2:54:43.500]  That was three years ago.
[2:54:43.500 --> 2:54:47.500]  We have a New York Times poll, 94% believe the government's lying about 9-11.
[2:54:47.500 --> 2:54:53.500]  Charlie Sheen, three years ago on CNN, 83% in their poll, agreed that there was a cover-up.
[2:54:53.500 --> 2:54:59.500]  We're the majority, and you have this tiny cabal trying to make us feel like we're bad, we're stupid, we're evil.
[2:54:59.500 --> 2:55:05.500]  And when Charlie had this idea for 20 minutes with the president, I had no idea how big it was going to get this quick.
[2:55:05.500 --> 2:55:08.500]  I mean, it's just off the charts.
[2:55:08.500 --> 2:55:15.500]  I mean, we're talking 24 hours into this, and it is just everywhere.
[2:55:15.500 --> 2:55:23.500]  And Charlie, again, is focused, he has to contractual agreements, he wants to focus on his TV show.
[2:55:23.500 --> 2:55:27.500]  They do the rehearsal tonight, shoot it tomorrow, air it Monday.
[2:55:27.500 --> 2:55:32.500]  Two and a half men, but next week, he's second time on Friday to be here.
[2:55:32.500 --> 2:55:36.500]  And I've asked him, I said, go ahead and do TV now, but he wants to focus and try to do that.
[2:55:36.500 --> 2:55:38.500]  He may do some stuff on the set.
[2:55:38.500 --> 2:55:40.500]  He's not sure if he can duck away on TV.
[2:55:40.500 --> 2:55:42.500]  I've told him go for it.
[2:55:42.500 --> 2:55:47.500]  National TV is in the works and a lot of other stuff.
[2:55:47.500 --> 2:55:50.500]  And some other things behind the scenes that I don't even want to get into.
[2:55:50.500 --> 2:55:54.500]  I'll let Charlie talk about it on Friday if he wants to, but he's got a lot of courage.
[2:55:54.500 --> 2:55:56.500]  Man, this is real.
[2:55:56.500 --> 2:55:58.500]  I can't believe I'm going up against these people.
[2:55:58.500 --> 2:56:02.500]  But I mean, you can't back off when you know they're murderers and did this.
[2:56:02.500 --> 2:56:05.500]  Richard Gage, in closing, you're going to be in New York speaking twice.
[2:56:05.500 --> 2:56:08.500]  People can find out more at Architects & Engineers for 9-Eleven Truth.
[2:56:08.500 --> 2:56:10.500]  What's the best website?
[2:56:10.500 --> 2:56:14.500]  Yeah, it's A-E-9-1-1-truth.org.
[2:56:14.500 --> 2:56:20.500]  It stands for Architects & Engineers for 9-Eleven Truth, A-E-9-1-1-truth.org.
[2:56:20.500 --> 2:56:24.500]  And I think, by the way, Alex, National Geographic did us a favor.
[2:56:24.500 --> 2:56:33.500]  That hit face was so bad that even thinking people will see the major obvious attempt to slander the truth movement
[2:56:33.500 --> 2:56:36.500]  and actually look at it and find out what the heck's going on.
[2:56:36.500 --> 2:56:41.500]  And that weird woman's voice, that weird woman's voice going, truth is...
[2:56:41.500 --> 2:56:44.500]  Then when she talked about the other people, she had a normal tone.
[2:56:44.500 --> 2:56:47.500]  And it was like a snake voisted or something.
[2:56:47.500 --> 2:56:49.500]  And it's just an absolute travesty.
[2:56:49.500 --> 2:56:51.500]  Do me a favor, I'm going to let you go.
[2:56:51.500 --> 2:56:53.500]  Mr. Gage, we appreciate your time.
[2:56:53.500 --> 2:56:56.500]  Contact me in a week or so when you're ready to release those transcripts
[2:56:56.500 --> 2:56:59.500]  of what really happened in the interviews where he's promising he's going to put that out.
[2:56:59.500 --> 2:57:03.500]  I'd like to have you on the air to expose that, to just show the deception.
[2:57:03.500 --> 2:57:05.500]  God bless you, my friend.
[2:57:05.500 --> 2:57:07.500]  Alex, we'll see you on the road.
[2:57:07.500 --> 2:57:09.500]  All right, amazing individual, Richard Gage.
[2:57:09.500 --> 2:57:10.500]  We appreciate him coming on with us.
[2:57:10.500 --> 2:57:11.500]  A lot of courage.
[2:57:11.500 --> 2:57:13.500]  Been through a lot that he doesn't talk about.
[2:57:13.500 --> 2:57:15.500]  Oh, man.
[2:57:15.500 --> 2:57:18.500]  I haven't really even thanked any of my sponsors today.
[2:57:18.500 --> 2:57:21.500]  We're coming up with Professor Stephen Jones at eight after.
[2:57:21.500 --> 2:57:23.500]  I want to hit some World Bank news, World Government news.
[2:57:23.500 --> 2:57:25.500]  I mean, just look at this, McClatchy newspapers.
[2:57:25.500 --> 2:57:28.500]  But I wanted to zoom in on that while I'm plugging this.
[2:57:28.500 --> 2:57:30.500]  I want to tell you about Eat Foods Direct.
[2:57:30.500 --> 2:57:32.500]  This is the best horrible foods company I found.
[2:57:32.500 --> 2:57:34.500]  I bought from three or four other places samples.
[2:57:34.500 --> 2:57:38.500]  MSG in it, genetically modified packages in foreign countries.
[2:57:38.500 --> 2:57:42.500]  Well, that is not the case, ladies and gentlemen, with EatFoodsDirect.com.
[2:57:42.500 --> 2:57:46.500]  And they're the biggest outfit out there in the longest continually operating.
[2:57:46.500 --> 2:57:51.500]  And so they give you the best deals and they package their food every month.
[2:57:51.500 --> 2:57:53.500]  It wasn't made 10 years ago or five years ago.
[2:57:53.500 --> 2:57:58.500]  So high quality, what I have in my storeable foods area in my garage last more than 10 years
[2:57:58.500 --> 2:58:01.500]  and climate control 10 years in your garage or attic.
[2:58:01.500 --> 2:58:06.500]  EatFoodsDirect.com. EatFoodsDirect.com, the letter E, then foodsdirect.com
[2:58:06.500 --> 2:58:12.500]  or 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633 and all these crazy times.
[2:58:12.500 --> 2:58:16.500]  If we do turn into Argentina like the Associated Press has top economists saying we are,
[2:58:16.500 --> 2:58:17.500]  you're going to need to have horrible food.
[2:58:17.500 --> 2:58:19.500]  I hope that's not the case.
[2:58:19.500 --> 2:58:20.500]  Maybe we can stop it.
[2:58:20.500 --> 2:58:22.500]  The point is, it's an insurance policy.

[2:58:51.500 --> 2:58:56.500]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:58:56.500 --> 2:59:00.500]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:59:00.500 --> 2:59:06.500]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:59:06.500 --> 2:59:11.500]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:59:11.500 --> 2:59:15.500]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:59:15.500 --> 2:59:17.500]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:59:17.500 --> 2:59:21.500]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:59:21.500 --> 2:59:25.500]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[2:59:25.500 --> 2:59:30.500]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:59:30.500 --> 2:59:34.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:59:34.500 --> 2:59:36.500]  a longtime sponsor of ours.
[2:59:36.500 --> 2:59:40.500]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:59:50.500 --> 2:59:59.500]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:09.500 --> 3:00:12.500]  The best of times, the worst of times, so much happening.
[3:00:12.500 --> 3:00:16.500]  For those that don't know, we had Charlie Sheen live on today with us.
[3:00:16.500 --> 3:00:19.500]  We also aired that 21-minute interview I did.
[3:00:19.500 --> 3:00:23.500]  A few weeks ago at his home, a video interview I did with him
[3:00:23.500 --> 3:00:28.500]  was going to be airing tomorrow and he'll be live with us on the air again Friday for 9-11.
[3:00:28.500 --> 3:00:32.500]  And he's going public for the 9-11 families who've fallen for new investigation
[3:00:32.500 --> 3:00:38.500]  for the six 9-11 Commission members of the 10 that come out and said it's a fraud, a lie, a hoax.
[3:00:38.500 --> 3:00:44.500]  We're doing this because we want to get the truth out of one of our children to live in a free country and a free society.
[3:00:44.500 --> 3:00:46.500]  Hitler used stage terror to get control.
[3:00:46.500 --> 3:00:48.500]  Stalin and Lenin did it to expand control.
[3:00:48.500 --> 3:00:49.500]  Mao did it.
[3:00:49.500 --> 3:00:51.500]  The Zars did it.
[3:00:51.500 --> 3:00:52.500]  So many other governments do it.
[3:00:52.500 --> 3:00:55.500]  And the criminals running our nation are doing it.
[3:00:55.500 --> 3:00:58.500]  And people need to face those facts and demand the truth.
[3:00:58.500 --> 3:01:01.500]  Professor Stephen Jones is going to be coming on this about 30-35 minutes
[3:01:01.500 --> 3:01:04.500]  and I am going to hit all this World Bank, World Government news.
[3:01:04.500 --> 3:01:06.500]  Let me just hit on some of it now, but I want to be honest.
[3:01:06.500 --> 3:01:12.500]  I want to dig into my stack from yesterday that was taken off my table, which is good.
[3:01:12.500 --> 3:01:14.500]  The guys clean up my pigsty in here.
[3:01:14.500 --> 3:01:18.500]  It's really messy, but I had a bunch of articles in my stack.
[3:01:18.500 --> 3:01:29.500]  Oh, here's yesterday's stack where they're openly announcing Argentine-style collapse for the United States
[3:01:29.500 --> 3:01:32.500]  and where all of this is coming out.
[3:01:32.500 --> 3:01:34.500]  And so I'm going to go over that.
[3:01:34.500 --> 3:01:41.500]  And when Professor Jones leaves us, I'm going to cover that in great detail.
[3:01:41.500 --> 3:01:47.500]  But I mean, here's one from today, a year after financial crisis, a new world order emerges.
[3:01:47.500 --> 3:01:52.500]  And then here's another one, Obama to seal US-UN relationship, the first US president to be a president,
[3:01:52.500 --> 3:01:56.500]  and the head of the International Security Council.
[3:01:56.500 --> 3:01:59.500]  And he's also the head of the National Security Council here that runs the FEMA camps,
[3:01:59.500 --> 3:02:01.500]  Homeland Security, the 400,000 troops.
[3:02:01.500 --> 3:02:04.500]  The Army openly says they're going to put on the streets of America.
[3:02:04.500 --> 3:02:10.500]  They're doing acclimation drills everywhere, running checkpoints for PR things that they think the public will buy,
[3:02:10.500 --> 3:02:16.500]  helping people at Carrex with the jaws of life, searching people for alcohol and drugs.
[3:02:16.500 --> 3:02:20.500]  Totally illegal, regular Army, regular Marines confirmed.
[3:02:20.500 --> 3:02:24.500]  I mean, the establishment really wants to take over so they can loot and rob the country.
[3:02:24.500 --> 3:02:27.500]  It's like when a bank robber comes in, says hands up, tells the security guard,
[3:02:27.500 --> 3:02:29.500]  drop your gun, put your hands up.
[3:02:29.500 --> 3:02:30.500]  I mean, they want our guns.
[3:02:30.500 --> 3:02:31.500]  They're saying hands up.
[3:02:31.500 --> 3:02:32.500]  They've introduced the bills to do it.
[3:02:32.500 --> 3:02:34.500]  They're saying hands up with the Army.
[3:02:34.500 --> 3:02:40.500]  The good news is the Army's full of a lot of good awake people in many respects.
[3:02:40.500 --> 3:02:42.500]  There aren't a lot of illegal aliens and foreigners and criminals.
[3:02:42.500 --> 3:02:44.500]  Now, that's pretty scary.
[3:02:44.500 --> 3:02:48.500]  It's kind of like what the government did shipping in the drugs in the 70s and 80s in Miami.
[3:02:48.500 --> 3:02:53.500]  I was watching a documentary, Coking Cowboys, about that jogging on the treadmill this morning.
[3:02:53.500 --> 3:02:59.500]  And I mean, it had everything I already knew, but there it was in video with the police saying and admitting it.
[3:02:59.500 --> 3:03:05.500]  And because of the crime way, they then got rid of all the rules.
[3:03:05.500 --> 3:03:08.500]  Police could be drug users and be on the force.
[3:03:08.500 --> 3:03:14.500]  And police, then it turned out, it said a whole new, the entire new class got killed or went to prison.
[3:03:14.500 --> 3:03:21.500]  The program shows cops saying the entire new class, I think I said of like 1980, 81, I forget, in the film,
[3:03:21.500 --> 3:03:23.500]  all died or went to prison.
[3:03:23.500 --> 3:03:24.500]  They were all dealing drugs.
[3:03:24.500 --> 3:03:29.500]  Of course, I mean, it's a $500 million dollar area industry in the U.S. alone.
[3:03:29.500 --> 3:03:30.500]  And you can launder that money.
[3:03:30.500 --> 3:03:37.500]  So it has that multiple value of the fact that they can launder it and the banks can loan out 10 times for a dollar they've got.
[3:03:37.500 --> 3:03:44.500]  And then the BBC just calmly admits the U.S. is guarding the poppy fields, but so the Taliban doesn't get it.
[3:03:44.500 --> 3:03:51.500]  And then you see opium production go up 10, 11, 12 fold last time I checked from the liberation of Afghanistan.
[3:03:51.500 --> 3:03:58.500]  It's about controlling opium, which is another 500 billion globally produces over 80% of the world's opium.
[3:03:58.500 --> 3:04:00.500]  It's turned into heroin.
[3:04:00.500 --> 3:04:03.500]  So it's just pouring out of there.
[3:04:03.500 --> 3:04:10.500]  And then I hear local police, one local cop's got a radio show and he's a nice guy I've met him,
[3:04:10.500 --> 3:04:13.500]  but he gets on air and says, I just can't believe that officers will deal drugs.
[3:04:13.500 --> 3:04:15.500]  I can't believe the government would deal drugs.
[3:04:15.500 --> 3:04:16.500]  What are you talking about?
[3:04:16.500 --> 3:04:27.500]  Serpico, all of it, LAPD, I mean, how many times have the police and the government, the CIA, how many times have CIA aircraft crash full of cocaine and heroin?
[3:04:27.500 --> 3:04:30.500]  And then they put people in jail if they get caught using it.
[3:04:30.500 --> 3:04:31.500]  I mean, it's a sick joke.
[3:04:31.500 --> 3:04:34.500]  We have to admit the government ships in the drugs.
[3:04:34.500 --> 3:04:38.500]  We have to admit they're staging the terror so they can then set up the police state.
[3:04:38.500 --> 3:04:40.500]  And they got the military involved in the war on drugs.
[3:04:40.500 --> 3:04:42.500]  Now they're going to use the military on the American people.
[3:04:42.500 --> 3:04:44.500]  They got the military involved in fighting al-Qaeda.
[3:04:44.500 --> 3:04:49.500]  Now they say, oh, Homeland Security document that we broke says we're going to use the army against you.
[3:04:49.500 --> 3:04:55.500]  And then we get sent secret documents and they break and mainstream news where the army is watching me, Ron Paul and others.
[3:04:55.500 --> 3:04:57.500]  I mean, the army is watching me.
[3:04:57.500 --> 3:04:58.500]  What for?
[3:04:58.500 --> 3:05:00.500]  I'm calling for peaceful.
[3:05:00.500 --> 3:05:04.500]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[3:05:04.500 --> 3:05:09.500]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[3:05:09.500 --> 3:05:14.500]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[3:05:14.500 --> 3:05:16.500]  Food is your only ammunition.
[3:05:16.500 --> 3:05:17.500]  How much do you want?
[3:05:17.500 --> 3:05:18.500]  When do you want it?
[3:05:18.500 --> 3:05:20.500]  Now or after the battle starts?
[3:05:20.500 --> 3:05:21.500]  When will you need it?
[3:05:21.500 --> 3:05:23.500]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[3:05:23.500 --> 3:05:25.500]  Will there be any food?
[3:05:25.500 --> 3:05:26.500]  Will it make your children sick?
[3:05:26.500 --> 3:05:32.500]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[3:05:32.500 --> 3:05:35.500]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:05:35.500 --> 3:05:39.500]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[3:05:39.500 --> 3:05:41.500]  How much will you need?
[3:05:41.500 --> 3:05:42.500]  We don't know.
[3:05:42.500 --> 3:05:43.500]  How much do you want?
[3:05:43.500 --> 3:05:44.500]  All you can get.
[3:05:44.500 --> 3:05:45.500]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:05:45.500 --> 3:05:48.500]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[3:06:00.500 --> 3:06:05.500]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:06:05.500 --> 3:06:10.500]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[3:06:10.500 --> 3:06:12.500]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:06:12.500 --> 3:06:14.500]  You don't have to cooperate.
[3:06:14.500 --> 3:06:15.500]  There is a solution.
[3:06:15.500 --> 3:06:18.500]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,
[3:06:18.500 --> 3:06:23.500]  have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[3:06:37.500 --> 3:06:43.500]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[3:07:26.500 --> 3:07:36.500]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:07:36.500 --> 3:07:42.500]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate
[3:07:42.500 --> 3:07:47.500]  that can help people lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income.
[3:07:47.500 --> 3:07:54.500]  Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:07:54.500 --> 3:07:58.500]  It takes very little money and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[3:07:58.500 --> 3:08:19.500]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[3:08:28.500 --> 3:08:39.500]  Dr. Professor Stephen Jones coming up here in just a moment with us.
[3:08:39.500 --> 3:08:44.500]  I do want to tell you about one more of the sponsors that has made today's show possible, maybe several,
[3:08:44.500 --> 3:08:48.500]  and they're not going to get to these until the end of the show and they're so incredibly important.
[3:08:48.500 --> 3:08:54.500]  One of them is the Color Blue. This is just an amazingly high-quality atmospheric water generator.
[3:08:54.500 --> 3:08:58.500]  Well, they've got a whole line of them. They've got huge ones. They sell to governments and militaries,
[3:08:58.500 --> 3:09:02.500]  but they have a small one for the home. Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on top of it.
[3:09:02.500 --> 3:09:09.500]  It grabs water out of the air from panels in the back, puts it through seven filters including reverse osmosis and carbon,
[3:09:09.500 --> 3:09:15.500]  and then has a UV anti-bacterial light in the stainless steel tank inside.
[3:09:15.500 --> 3:09:21.500]  The Color Blue 28 machine will allow you to get off the grid. You can even get solar panels.
[3:09:21.500 --> 3:09:24.500]  They sell a converter that goes with it that works just for their machine.
[3:09:24.500 --> 3:09:26.500]  If you have solar, very inexpensive to get that converter.
[3:09:26.500 --> 3:09:52.500]  Call the Blue.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[3:09:52.500 --> 3:10:00.500]  Let's bring now to Professor Stephen Jones, who four years ago, now How Time Flies Went Public.
[3:10:00.500 --> 3:10:07.500]  Stephen Jones, a retired professor of physics, has published papers in Scientific American, Nature, and Physical Review.
[3:10:07.500 --> 3:10:13.500]  Letters, his peer-reviewed papers on the collapse of the World Trade Center, towers, all three of them,
[3:10:13.500 --> 3:10:19.500]  when only two were hit by airplanes, is being widely read and has been translated into Spanish, French, and Japanese.
[3:10:19.500 --> 3:10:26.500]  He's available at the Journal of 911Studies.com along with 26 other scholarly letters regarding the events of 9-11, 2001.
[3:10:26.500 --> 3:10:35.500]  His ongoing research includes experiments with thermites, along with electron microscope energy,
[3:10:35.500 --> 3:10:42.500]  spectromagraphic analysis of dust and slag from the WTC, and we really appreciate him coming on.
[3:10:42.500 --> 3:10:49.500]  He appeared today to debunk the debunkers who lied to Gage and said, oh, we're going to show you talking about this evidence,
[3:10:49.500 --> 3:10:52.500]  showed him a rough cut and said this will be in the show.
[3:10:52.500 --> 3:10:54.500]  They have transcripts of that now, proving it.
[3:10:54.500 --> 3:10:56.500]  They gave him the transcripts.
[3:10:56.500 --> 3:11:00.500]  This same group is known for doing hit pieces on, quote, conspiracy theorists.
[3:11:00.500 --> 3:11:03.500]  It's their specialty. Creative differences is the name.
[3:11:03.500 --> 3:11:05.500]  And they also did this ridiculous thermite.
[3:11:05.500 --> 3:11:10.500]  I mean, I've seen thermite tests where they put a cup of it over on an engine block, and it melts right through in seconds.
[3:11:10.500 --> 3:11:17.500]  I've seen, but this thermite barely even sparked, but just for a few seconds, showing there were hundreds of pounds on it.
[3:11:17.500 --> 3:11:25.500]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, and then they acted like explosive thermite didn't exist, nano-thermite, super-thermite.
[3:11:25.500 --> 3:11:28.500]  I mean, this was crazy when we have all the patents and the rest of it.
[3:11:28.500 --> 3:11:30.500]  So I wanted to get Professor Stephen Jones on with us.
[3:11:30.500 --> 3:11:31.500]  Professor, it's great to have you.
[3:11:31.500 --> 3:11:36.500]  Thanks, Alex. It's great to be with you again here today.
[3:11:36.500 --> 3:11:42.500]  Okay. Briefly recap. Most people know who you are, but for those that don't, how you got into this and then let's get into thermite,
[3:11:42.500 --> 3:11:48.500]  thermite, the different samples, what it shows, how it fits with the NIST report, fits with the firefighter testimony.
[3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:50.500]  Break it down, sir.
[3:11:50.500 --> 3:11:52.500]  Okay. Sure.
[3:11:52.500 --> 3:11:57.500]  Well, to begin, let me start with the Journal of 911 Studies that you mentioned.
[3:11:57.500 --> 3:12:00.500]  We now have over 100 papers and letters.
[3:12:00.500 --> 3:12:03.500]  So the list has grown dramatically.
[3:12:03.500 --> 3:12:07.500]  These are all peer-reviewed, and I encourage people to go there.
[3:12:07.500 --> 3:12:17.500]  Of course, we also have the papers that you mentioned in more established scientific journals, technical journals, civil engineering journals,
[3:12:17.500 --> 3:12:28.500]  and of course, the open chemical physics journal has our latest paper with Neil Tarrant, Jeff Fair, myself, and a total of nine authors, I think.
[3:12:28.500 --> 3:12:36.500]  And so, let's see, my other phone was ringing, Alex. Sorry.
[3:12:36.500 --> 3:12:38.500]  That's okay, sir. Go ahead.
[3:12:38.500 --> 3:12:50.500]  So, yeah, it's been quite an adventure trying to explain to people the difference between nanothermite or superthermite, same thing there,
[3:12:50.500 --> 3:12:54.500]  compared to ordinary macro-thermite.
[3:12:54.500 --> 3:12:59.500]  And I'll say I explained that very carefully to the National Geographic people.
[3:12:59.500 --> 3:13:09.500]  And they did get some of that straight, but you just couldn't seem to bring it to admit that, you know, here's a form of
[3:13:09.500 --> 3:13:17.500]  thermite that's nanothermite that's distinctly different from ordinary thermite, and the nanothermite is explosive,
[3:13:17.500 --> 3:13:24.500]  and can be tailored to be a high explosive, and they just didn't do it.
[3:13:24.500 --> 3:13:29.500]  And then, of course, this test they did, you mentioned that, where they piled up ordinary thermite.
[3:13:29.500 --> 3:13:36.500]  They didn't even put sulfur in it. That would have been interesting if they'd done at least that, which I talked about in my first paper.
[3:13:36.500 --> 3:13:44.500]  And, you know, you and I talked about thermite, which is the sulfur added to thermite at some length,
[3:13:44.500 --> 3:13:50.500]  explaining the difference. And, of course, the sulfur observed in samples of World Trade Center steel,
[3:13:50.500 --> 3:13:59.500]  observed by the guys at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and published that great mystery New York Times said,
[3:13:59.500 --> 3:14:03.500]  how did the sulfur get in the steel?
[3:14:03.500 --> 3:14:08.500]  Sorry, Claremont's wrote a little here, but, yeah, so they didn't even add sulfur.
[3:14:08.500 --> 3:14:16.500]  And, of course, they didn't test nanothermite at all. And they kept saying, I just was reviewing that this morning,
[3:14:16.500 --> 3:14:24.500]  the Nat Geo program. And they kept saying, well, thermite is not explosive, will not explode.
[3:14:24.500 --> 3:14:30.500]  Well, excuse me, there is a form called nanothermite that will explode.
[3:14:30.500 --> 3:14:38.500]  So, you know, they just totally obfuscated that important point. And, you know, I kept hammering that.
[3:14:38.500 --> 3:14:42.500]  They did quote me on that in the program briefly.
[3:14:42.500 --> 3:14:51.500]  But, of course, their tests had nothing to do with what we're talking about in the nanothermite paper.
[3:14:51.500 --> 3:14:58.500]  Nothing whatsoever, no correlation at all. And I told them, I was really upset when I heard about that in March,
[3:14:58.500 --> 3:15:05.500]  that they're proposing this, well, they're not proposing it, they've already done this experiment.
[3:15:05.500 --> 3:15:14.500]  I called it pathetic. I said this in no way represents my views to stack up a bunch of ordinary thermite around a steel column.
[3:15:14.500 --> 3:15:19.500]  I never said anything like that. We're talking about nanothermite in this paper,
[3:15:19.500 --> 3:15:25.500]  and thermite, which is sulfur added to thermite, it looks like that was also present.
[3:15:25.500 --> 3:15:30.500]  Good evidence for that was the sulfur in the World Trade Center steel sample.
[3:15:30.500 --> 3:15:36.500]  But to do it with ordinary thermite, and the way they did it, it's just ludicrous.
[3:15:36.500 --> 3:15:42.500]  And, of course, I told them it's a strawman argument. It's not. It supposedly represents my views,
[3:15:42.500 --> 3:15:48.500]  but in no way comes close to what I have stated.
[3:15:48.500 --> 3:15:56.500]  Well, I want to get into the science with you, Professor, today. But first, did they hold out in a dishonest way to you,
[3:15:56.500 --> 3:16:01.500]  in the way Richard Gage, who I think has the highest credibility, I mean, he doesn't like to get in fights,
[3:16:01.500 --> 3:16:07.500]  he doesn't like to be nasty, he puts up with a lot of crap. He's a genteel person, scholarly like yourself.
[3:16:07.500 --> 3:16:12.500]  But I mean, he said this was a complete lie, a complete deception, a complete fraud.
[3:16:12.500 --> 3:16:23.500]  Well, you know, I think that there's certainly some elements there that I would have to say that NADGEO was disingenuous.
[3:16:23.500 --> 3:16:33.500]  I mean, I said, look, NIST just can't seem to admit that there is a form of thermite, nanothermite, that is explosive.
[3:16:33.500 --> 3:16:42.500]  I hope you can get that straight and tell the facts. This is what we're claiming now. It's nanothermite with the main culprit here.
[3:16:42.500 --> 3:16:49.500]  Oh, yeah, they say repeatedly they don't even know that it exists, even though you have all the patents and NASA uses it in missile separation.
[3:16:49.500 --> 3:16:54.500]  I mean, it just so happens the Pentagon has a lot, and then their scientists just so happen to have those patents,
[3:16:54.500 --> 3:16:59.500]  and you got a bunch of NIST experts that are the few in the world on it, but no big deal.
[3:16:59.500 --> 3:17:09.500]  And, you know, there's data published, as we quoted in our nanothermite paper, we published from Livermore National Laboratory,
[3:17:09.500 --> 3:17:15.500]  for example, Tillerson and Gash and those scientists, and, you know, they're publishing their data,
[3:17:15.500 --> 3:17:21.500]  and we compared our data with theirs for the differential scanning calorimeter, for example.
[3:17:21.500 --> 3:17:31.500]  The composition is the same as theirs. I mean, you know, as you mentioned, they have very ultra-fine iron and aluminum.
[3:17:31.500 --> 3:17:40.500]  This is not something that happens as the building falls down to get this complex mix of ultra-fine.
[3:17:40.500 --> 3:17:45.500]  This is very exotic, and from sample after sample after sample, you find the same signature.
[3:17:45.500 --> 3:17:57.500]  That's exactly right. And so, for them to obscure all that, particularly after my...actually, I was just pleading with Robert Erickson
[3:17:57.500 --> 3:18:03.500]  to please get this straight. NIST can't seem to admit it, but surely you can,
[3:18:03.500 --> 3:18:09.500]  that there's a difference between incendiary thermite and explosive nanothermite.
[3:18:09.500 --> 3:18:15.500]  There's a difference between night and day, you know, and sure enough, they obscured it again.
[3:18:15.500 --> 3:18:23.500]  And so, yes, I must say that does seem disingenuous to me. I don't see how you can say it otherwise.
[3:18:23.500 --> 3:18:28.500]  Well, I know you don't get into the Pentagon, but firing missiles into fiberglass chicken cubes,
[3:18:28.500 --> 3:18:31.500]  and I recognize that's what it looked like out of a farm supply.
[3:18:31.500 --> 3:18:35.500]  A fiberglass little thin thing and blowing it up with a pound of plastic explosive
[3:18:35.500 --> 3:18:38.500]  and saying a missile would have blown the whole Pentagon up. I mean, this was...
[3:18:38.500 --> 3:18:42.500]  This was just...I mean, I was watching this and I couldn't believe it.
[3:18:42.500 --> 3:18:46.500]  And they would go, the science, the truthers.
[3:18:46.500 --> 3:18:52.500]  And they would, like, off the page, have an old crooked, the word truther, even on your name tags to make you look...
[3:18:52.500 --> 3:18:53.500]  Right.
[3:18:53.500 --> 3:18:58.500]  And they wouldn't have the camera shots as nice with you guys, but with them, with their experts, they would.
[3:18:58.500 --> 3:19:02.500]  I mean, it was...I mean, but we had History Channel do this to us.
[3:19:02.500 --> 3:19:07.500]  They would do stuff like, I would give a speech to a standalone crowd of 600 people.
[3:19:07.500 --> 3:19:11.500]  And then they're in a recess here in Austin when they shot that.
[3:19:11.500 --> 3:19:14.500]  They would just show the bleachers while I was talking with, like, three people in them.
[3:19:14.500 --> 3:19:15.500]  Uh-huh. Yeah.
[3:19:15.500 --> 3:19:17.500]  And I mean, just...I mean, everybody...
[3:19:17.500 --> 3:19:20.500]  I mean, we had LA with 1200 everywhere we go. It's a standing room only.
[3:19:20.500 --> 3:19:23.500]  Every movie I've ever shown has been sold out.
[3:19:23.500 --> 3:19:24.500]  I mean, I don't know what they're...
[3:19:24.500 --> 3:19:30.500]  But again, they use sophomoric psychology of, look, he's not popular.
[3:19:30.500 --> 3:19:32.500]  That's what psychology today did.
[3:19:32.500 --> 3:19:36.500]  They said, Alex had no fr...you know, basically, Alex says he had friends, but we couldn't prove it.
[3:19:36.500 --> 3:19:39.500]  Alex said he has a good family life, but he wouldn't let us talk to his family.
[3:19:39.500 --> 3:19:44.500]  You know, when I have a great family life and great friends in great high school,
[3:19:44.500 --> 3:19:48.500]  it's a little too wild. It was a little too fun.
[3:19:48.500 --> 3:19:50.500]  You know, but, uh...
[3:19:50.500 --> 3:19:56.500]  I mean, again, it's meant to sell the idea that we're like these outcast cooks when we are the majority.
[3:19:56.500 --> 3:20:07.500]  Professor Stephen Jones, stay with us. We'll be right back after this quick break.

[3:21:01.500 --> 3:21:06.500]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[3:21:06.500 --> 3:21:08.500]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:21:08.500 --> 3:21:11.500]  You like being a puppet, sir? You like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:21:11.500 --> 3:21:14.500]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[3:21:14.500 --> 3:21:19.500]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R.
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:27.500]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:21:27.500 --> 3:21:33.500]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:21:33.500 --> 3:21:37.500]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:21:37.500 --> 3:21:43.500]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:21:43.500 --> 3:21:46.500]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:21:46.500 --> 3:21:52.500]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.

[3:24:01.500 --> 3:24:04.500]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[3:24:04.500 --> 3:24:27.500]  Would you stand tall and strong if you saw the things that were wrong?
[3:24:27.500 --> 3:24:37.500]  Well, Professor Stephen E. Jones did, kind of like Galileo saying that the earth orbited the sun, not the sun orbiting the earth.
[3:24:37.500 --> 3:24:40.500]  And the truth is coming out and the system is scared.
[3:24:40.500 --> 3:24:46.500]  Professor Jones, do you agree with me that, or give us your take on this, that we see all these new hit pieces coming out now?
[3:24:46.500 --> 3:24:51.500]  Because they understand 9-11 Truth has just continued to grow and didn't go away.
[3:24:51.500 --> 3:24:58.500]  Isn't just a political thing of bashing Bush, that stage terror is something that people really understand now?
[3:24:58.500 --> 3:25:06.500]  I do agree with you there, Alex. I think that we are making progress worldwide, not just the United States.
[3:25:06.500 --> 3:25:13.500]  I mean, Niels Heret is Professor Heret and Denmark gets calls from all over.
[3:25:13.500 --> 3:25:18.500]  He told me that he's been in the media a great deal in Europe.
[3:25:18.500 --> 3:25:25.500]  So I know that in Europe, people are waking up, including Russia, of course, and other countries.
[3:25:25.500 --> 3:25:32.500]  In this country, it seems like every September 11th, we're coming up again, two days.
[3:25:32.500 --> 3:25:36.500]  And we get this burst of interest, which is good.
[3:25:36.500 --> 3:25:44.500]  But like you say, in that GEO program, we get this mocking, basically, calling us truthers.
[3:25:44.500 --> 3:25:50.500]  And look at these guys' psychology, you know, psychoanalyzing us that we're so paranoid.
[3:25:50.500 --> 3:25:53.500]  I mean, that was the term they used.
[3:25:53.500 --> 3:25:59.500]  As if we can't do science, that's the beauty of science, as I've repeated, Alex,
[3:25:59.500 --> 3:26:05.500]  is that anyone, regardless of belief system, can get the same result.
[3:26:05.500 --> 3:26:10.500]  If anyone will take a dare here, look at the World Trade Center dust,
[3:26:10.500 --> 3:26:16.500]  you'll see these chips that are red on one side, gray on the other, very distinctive.
[3:26:16.500 --> 3:26:20.500]  And then do the tests that we did, and you'll get the same result.
[3:26:20.500 --> 3:26:24.500]  Yeah, you're finding the nanothermite, I mean, itself, unignited.
[3:26:24.500 --> 3:26:30.500]  There was one issue that had any credibility, the one shred watching the program several times,
[3:26:30.500 --> 3:26:35.500]  and I thought had any basis, was this claim, well, your chain of custody.
[3:26:35.500 --> 3:26:41.500]  But you have FEMA coming in two days after locking it down, saying federal crime to even take photos.
[3:26:41.500 --> 3:26:46.500]  They cut up the steel, ship it off, but you and others were able to go to the different states
[3:26:46.500 --> 3:26:49.500]  and cities that have gotten it, you know, to build memorials with it.
[3:26:49.500 --> 3:26:53.500]  You were able to get it from people that owned homes or apartments nearby where it was still wrecked.
[3:26:53.500 --> 3:26:58.500]  I mean, speak to that because you've got a bunch of different places you've gotten this.
[3:26:58.500 --> 3:26:59.500]  Absolutely.
[3:26:59.500 --> 3:27:06.500]  We've studied in detail six samples now, if I count correctly, four are reported in the paper,
[3:27:06.500 --> 3:27:11.500]  but we've been looking at more samples and they all have the same signature
[3:27:11.500 --> 3:27:16.500]  of the red, gray material, these chips that still blow up.
[3:27:16.500 --> 3:27:20.500]  The red material side blows up after all these years.
[3:27:20.500 --> 3:27:26.500]  And let me say, in the paper, we make an effort to spell out the chain of custody
[3:27:26.500 --> 3:27:29.500]  for those samples that we reported on in the paper.
[3:27:29.500 --> 3:27:37.500]  We pointed out the distinct chemical similarity, the chemical signatures being the same in all four samples.
[3:27:37.500 --> 3:27:42.500]  So really, this basis, maybe someone could, what could it be?
[3:27:42.500 --> 3:27:44.500]  They salted these samples.
[3:27:44.500 --> 3:27:52.500]  How could they reach these independent collectors and New York citizens who did save some of the deaths?
[3:27:52.500 --> 3:27:57.500]  And I've heard of others since, and I had a call this morning, another fellow had saved some deaths.
[3:27:57.500 --> 3:28:02.500]  So people were saving it as a souvenir, nothing else.
[3:28:02.500 --> 3:28:10.500]  And to suppose that they salted these, now that's really stretching credulity.
[3:28:10.500 --> 3:28:13.500]  So I haven't heard that argument too much recently.
[3:28:13.500 --> 3:28:21.500]  The one argument I have heard recently, Alex, is, well, Professor Eager, he'll find anything.
[3:28:21.500 --> 3:28:24.500]  He didn't complain about the chain of custody.
[3:28:24.500 --> 3:28:28.500]  He was complaining, he said, well, this has got to be primer paint.
[3:28:28.500 --> 3:28:34.500]  This paint that was put on the steel, and it's not explosive at all, it's just paint, you know, ordinary primer paint.
[3:28:34.500 --> 3:28:39.500]  Well, we found a sample of steel.
[3:28:39.500 --> 3:28:46.500]  This is actually at a memorial in Clarkson College in New York State.
[3:28:46.500 --> 3:28:52.500]  Like I say, there are these samples around, and this one happens to be at Clarkson.
[3:28:52.500 --> 3:28:57.500]  I contacted an individual who lives nearby.
[3:28:57.500 --> 3:29:04.500]  She contacted the fellow that actually put the memorial together, he does welding.
[3:29:04.500 --> 3:29:06.500]  So he put that together.
[3:29:06.500 --> 3:29:20.500]  He collected for us, for her, and then she sent it to us, a sample right off the steel of the actual primer paint that was still on the World Trade Center steel.
[3:29:20.500 --> 3:29:26.500]  So we tested this primer paint, and it's not the same as these red chips, not at all.
[3:29:26.500 --> 3:29:32.500]  All of the primer paint samples show potassium, magnesium, and zinc.
[3:29:32.500 --> 3:29:39.500]  None of the chips, when you, I'm talking about when you get a fresh surface for both, right?
[3:29:39.500 --> 3:29:41.500]  Paint and chips, look at the fresh surface.
[3:29:41.500 --> 3:29:43.500]  Professor, stay there, we got a break.
[3:29:43.500 --> 3:29:49.500]  Come back, continue with that, only on the side as we debunk the hit piece put out by National Geographic.
[3:29:49.500 --> 3:29:51.500]  Stay with us.
[3:29:51.500 --> 3:29:55.500]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.500 --> 3:30:01.500]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.500 --> 3:30:05.500]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:30:05.500 --> 3:30:07.500]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:07.500 --> 3:30:15.500]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:15.500 --> 3:30:21.500]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:30:21.500 --> 3:30:23.500]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:23.500 --> 3:30:29.500]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[3:33:21.500 --> 3:33:27.500]  This is a kind of visual confirms jetliner from Cancun, hijacked on runway at Mexico City Airport.
[3:33:27.500 --> 3:33:30.500]  That's all there is.
[3:33:30.500 --> 3:33:34.500]  Seeing in, just watching during the break is saying that maybe getting the people off the plane.
[3:33:34.500 --> 3:33:37.500]  999, you knew something would happen.
[3:33:37.500 --> 3:33:40.500]  Can't wait till this day's over. The globalist are obsessed with numerology.
[3:33:40.500 --> 3:33:42.500]  Flip 999 over.
[3:33:42.500 --> 3:33:43.500]  What do you get?
[3:33:43.500 --> 3:33:46.500]  Of course, we're coming up on 911.
[3:33:46.500 --> 3:33:49.500]  I don't believe in that stuff, but they sure do.
[3:33:49.500 --> 3:33:52.500]  We have all the huge new developments with the Charlie Sheen exclusive interviews here.
[3:33:52.500 --> 3:33:55.500]  He was live today. That's coming up in the first hour of the show.
[3:33:55.500 --> 3:34:00.500]  I didn't announce it right at first, but he popped in at the bottom of the hour and we aired in its entirety.
[3:34:00.500 --> 3:34:03.500]  I've never before heard interview. I did with him a few weeks ago at his home.
[3:34:03.500 --> 3:34:08.500]  A 21-minute interview aired in the second hour.
[3:34:08.500 --> 3:34:15.500]  And so that is all coming up again at the retransmission points at infowars.com and on your local AM and FM stations,
[3:34:15.500 --> 3:34:19.500]  GlobalSport, WAVWWCR and the satellite.
[3:34:19.500 --> 3:34:22.500]  Going back to Professor Steven Jones and the 10 minutes we have left with him,
[3:34:22.500 --> 3:34:25.500]  then I'm going to cover financial news and some other issues.
[3:34:25.500 --> 3:34:29.500]  Professor Jones, you were making a point about...
[3:34:29.500 --> 3:34:30.500]  Right.
[3:34:30.500 --> 3:34:33.500]  So you got the paint that was on the steel, not the same thing.
[3:34:33.500 --> 3:34:35.500]  Right. It's not at all the same.
[3:34:35.500 --> 3:34:40.500]  It's very distinct from the red-gray chip material.
[3:34:40.500 --> 3:34:49.500]  The paint, just to recap that, as we looked at it, using the electron microscopy system
[3:34:49.500 --> 3:34:54.500]  and X-ray dispersive spectroscopy, that's that term.
[3:34:54.500 --> 3:34:58.500]  And I tell people that will be on the quiz.
[3:34:58.500 --> 3:35:03.500]  You know, I appreciate when people make an effort to understand some of the things that we're trying to do.
[3:35:03.500 --> 3:35:06.500]  We're probing with electron beams.
[3:35:06.500 --> 3:35:09.500]  We're looking at the materials that's in the dust.
[3:35:09.500 --> 3:35:13.500]  We're finding this pyrotechnic explosive material.
[3:35:13.500 --> 3:35:15.500]  You know, I think people understand that.
[3:35:15.500 --> 3:35:16.500]  That is significant.
[3:35:16.500 --> 3:35:18.500]  It shouldn't be there in quantities like that.
[3:35:18.500 --> 3:35:21.500]  I mean, this is an office building for him's sake.
[3:35:21.500 --> 3:35:29.500]  And the one sample was collected within 20 minutes of the fall of the second tower, the north tower.
[3:35:29.500 --> 3:35:33.500]  So this cannot be contaminated by cleanup operations.
[3:35:33.500 --> 3:35:38.500]  There were no cleanup operations 20 minutes after the second tower collapsed.
[3:35:38.500 --> 3:35:43.500]  This was fellow Frank DeLessio scooped that up, got that dust.
[3:35:43.500 --> 3:35:47.500]  We found an abundance of these red-gray chips in that sample.
[3:35:47.500 --> 3:35:50.500]  And his friend, what's his name?
[3:35:50.500 --> 3:35:52.500]  Brian Bach also testified.
[3:35:52.500 --> 3:35:54.500]  We have their testimony on tape.
[3:35:54.500 --> 3:35:56.500]  The chain of custody is clear.
[3:35:56.500 --> 3:35:58.500]  Straight to me.
[3:35:58.500 --> 3:36:03.500]  And Jeff Fair, Dr. Fair at BYU.
[3:36:03.500 --> 3:36:12.500]  So again, when we compare the primer paints, this is from steel in a monument at Clarkson College in New York State.
[3:36:12.500 --> 3:36:15.500]  Compare that primer paint with these red-gray chips.
[3:36:15.500 --> 3:36:17.500]  They are not the same at all.
[3:36:17.500 --> 3:36:20.500]  The primer paint always shows zinc in abundance.
[3:36:20.500 --> 3:36:22.500]  There's a reason for that.
[3:36:22.500 --> 3:36:25.500]  And always shows potassium, always shows magnesium.
[3:36:25.500 --> 3:36:27.500]  This is a fresh surface now.
[3:36:27.500 --> 3:36:32.500]  You break off a chunk and you look at the edge so that you're not talking about dust.
[3:36:32.500 --> 3:36:34.500]  You're not talking about dust now.
[3:36:34.500 --> 3:36:40.500]  You're talking about what's in the actual material.
[3:36:40.500 --> 3:36:45.500]  So the paint shows those elements, zinc, potassium, magnesium, always.
[3:36:45.500 --> 3:36:52.500]  Whereas the red material never shows those elements completely distinct.
[3:36:52.500 --> 3:36:54.500]  What are the chips?
[3:36:54.500 --> 3:36:56.500]  Are you saying it's nanothermite?
[3:36:56.500 --> 3:36:59.500]  It certainly has that characteristic.
[3:36:59.500 --> 3:37:01.500]  I'm persuaded that it is nanothermite.
[3:37:01.500 --> 3:37:08.500]  I mean, it's an explosive material or pyrotechnic in the sense that it reacts violently.
[3:37:08.500 --> 3:37:13.500]  We published that in our nanothermite paper in the Open Chemical Physics.
[3:37:13.500 --> 3:37:16.500]  And you wouldn't put an accelerant.
[3:37:16.500 --> 3:37:20.500]  You wouldn't put something explosive as fireproofing on buildings.
[3:37:20.500 --> 3:37:21.500]  Absolutely.
[3:37:21.500 --> 3:37:23.500]  No, absolutely not.
[3:37:23.500 --> 3:37:25.500]  It's a very dangerous material.
[3:37:25.500 --> 3:37:28.500]  You wouldn't want to breathe it in either, Alex.
[3:37:28.500 --> 3:37:33.500]  That's another, like Asbestos, it's one of those bad actors that was in the dust.
[3:37:33.500 --> 3:37:35.500]  The EPA told us it was safe.
[3:37:35.500 --> 3:37:39.500]  Of course, as an example, the government lied to us.
[3:37:39.500 --> 3:37:45.500]  In that case, the whistleblower, Nikki Tinsley, was the EPA General Inspector.
[3:37:45.500 --> 3:37:50.500]  And she blew the whistle on the EPA for lying to the people about the safety of the dust.
[3:37:50.500 --> 3:37:53.500]  And by the way, seven years ago, they would call it a conspiracy theory.
[3:37:53.500 --> 3:38:00.500]  If you said Christina Todd Wettman was covering up for Bush, later it came out that one of her reports said the dust is dangerous in the first week.
[3:38:00.500 --> 3:38:02.500]  The White House said shut that down.
[3:38:02.500 --> 3:38:03.500]  That's right.
[3:38:03.500 --> 3:38:11.500]  And yeah, and the EPA Inspector General Tinsley, she spelled that out and wrote that up in a report and it got into the press.
[3:38:11.500 --> 3:38:15.500]  I think it was in 03 that that truth came out about what the EPA had done.
[3:38:15.500 --> 3:38:24.500]  So, you know, it's a clear example of where the government, high-level White House, you'd say, has lied to us.
[3:38:24.500 --> 3:38:28.500]  And so now here we have, we're having to ferret this out.
[3:38:28.500 --> 3:38:34.500]  NIST refuses to look for explosives or explosive residues in the World Trade Center dust.
[3:38:34.500 --> 3:38:42.500]  Well, we've done so and we challenge them to do so, you know, but they have just adamantly refused.
[3:38:42.500 --> 3:38:47.500]  And their excuse is, well, if you look for something that isn't there, you won't find it.
[3:38:47.500 --> 3:38:52.500]  I'm saying, excuse me, how do you know it's not there until you look, you know.
[3:38:52.500 --> 3:38:54.500]  But it's just really remarkable.
[3:38:54.500 --> 3:39:07.500]  And if I may throw in another one, which of course was missed by the NAT Geo program, that is the freefall acceleration of World Trade Center 7 for over two seconds.
[3:39:07.500 --> 3:39:12.500]  That's over 100 feet, the roof was measured by David Chandler.
[3:39:12.500 --> 3:39:21.500]  I looked at this at 2, but to David's credit, he plotted the data, you know, and showed this is essentially freefall.
[3:39:21.500 --> 3:39:23.500]  And then he and I both challenged NIST.
[3:39:23.500 --> 3:39:30.500]  Remember last August they had this forum where you could send in questions by email, which I did, and he did.
[3:39:30.500 --> 3:39:36.500]  We both challenged him on their statements about the rate of fall of the World Trade Center 7.
[3:39:36.500 --> 3:39:41.500]  And sure enough, NIST, this is a little bit to their credit.
[3:39:41.500 --> 3:39:43.500]  They came back and plotted the data.
[3:39:43.500 --> 3:39:44.500]  It agrees.
[3:39:44.500 --> 3:39:47.500]  It lines up with freefall acceleration.
[3:39:47.500 --> 3:39:51.500]  It lines up with what David Chandler and I were trying to say.
[3:39:51.500 --> 3:39:58.500]  And so they admitted that, but to their great discredit, they did not go back and say, well, this is really strange.
[3:39:58.500 --> 3:40:00.500]  That means there's nothing impeding the fall.
[3:40:00.500 --> 3:40:01.500]  That's what freefall means.
[3:40:01.500 --> 3:40:02.500]  There's nothing in the way.
[3:40:02.500 --> 3:40:06.500]  You know, you've got hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and concrete.
[3:40:06.500 --> 3:40:09.500]  These beams don't just give up and disappear.
[3:40:09.500 --> 3:40:12.500]  Their mass alone would slow the roof down, but nothing's loaded down.
[3:40:12.500 --> 3:40:15.500]  That takes explosives to move this material out of the way.
[3:40:15.500 --> 3:40:22.500]  It's a prime evidence for explosives, along with the red chips that we have found.
[3:40:22.500 --> 3:40:25.500]  But what NIST did, they swept that data.
[3:40:25.500 --> 3:40:31.500]  They showed the plot, but then they say, oh, this is consistent with our computer model at the end of that.
[3:40:31.500 --> 3:40:33.500]  And they've discovered it anymore.
[3:40:33.500 --> 3:40:39.500]  And so you know that a computer model, which they will not let us test.
[3:40:39.500 --> 3:40:47.500]  I mean, it just can't be, Alex, having hundreds of thousands of tons of material in the way and you get freefall.
[3:40:47.500 --> 3:40:52.500]  Unless they took that out of the computer model, which actually you can do in a computer.
[3:40:52.500 --> 3:40:58.500]  But the simulation that you can do that in real life, unless you use explosives to move the material out of the way.
[3:40:58.500 --> 3:41:06.500]  But underwriting laboratories in their own report said that they did fire testing for similar things and it didn't make anything collapse.
[3:41:06.500 --> 3:41:08.500]  And it didn't fail, did not fail, right?
[3:41:08.500 --> 3:41:13.500]  Kevin Ryan pointed that one out and he lost his job over making that one public.
[3:41:13.500 --> 3:41:15.500]  As I recall, that was the issue.
[3:41:15.500 --> 3:41:19.500]  That's right. You were persecuted, no doubt, and driven out of your professorship.
[3:41:19.500 --> 3:41:22.500]  Even though you were one of the top lights at that university.
[3:41:22.500 --> 3:41:25.500]  Huge developments and discoveries in your own right.
[3:41:25.500 --> 3:41:30.500]  But the truth is the truth and God loves you for what you've done and the American people do.
[3:41:30.500 --> 3:41:35.500]  I hear there's a film coming out soon with a lot of the material that you presented in it.
[3:41:35.500 --> 3:41:39.500]  With material that I presented included in a bill.
[3:41:39.500 --> 3:41:41.500]  No, no, in a film. I'm sorry.
[3:41:41.500 --> 3:41:44.500]  Oh, I'm sorry. A film. Yes. Yeah.
[3:41:44.500 --> 3:41:48.500]  Dylan Avery and his guys are doing one. Is that the one you're talking about?
[3:41:48.500 --> 3:41:55.500]  Well, there's that one, but I've seen other stuff on the web. I guess a lot of people are just taking your material then and making films.
[3:41:55.500 --> 3:41:58.500]  That is very, very exciting, Professor.
[3:41:58.500 --> 3:42:02.500]  Yeah, and you know, again, I have to emphasize, it's not just me, Alex.
[3:42:02.500 --> 3:42:12.500]  I worked with Neil Tarrant and Dr. Ferrer, Kevin Ryan, Frank Lakey, Brad Larson, you know, Danny Farnsworth.
[3:42:12.500 --> 3:42:16.500]  Yeah, these are a lot of serious engineers and physicists and scientists.
[3:42:16.500 --> 3:42:23.500]  They have a lot to lose. And I remember you talking about the professor at BYU, you know, he just said, well, I'll look at it.
[3:42:23.500 --> 3:42:29.500]  And then, of course, he found what you found. And we all wish this wasn't true. I wish this wasn't the case.
[3:42:29.500 --> 3:42:30.500]  Right.
[3:42:30.500 --> 3:42:35.500]  But I mean, I wish three years ago I had medical doctors on and they said, look, in the trials of Gardasil,
[3:42:35.500 --> 3:42:40.500]  human papillomavirus vaccine, it's killing girls and maiming and paralyzing them.
[3:42:40.500 --> 3:42:46.500]  I went on air and talked about it and got made fun of by the media. And then now it's all over the news, everywhere I turn,
[3:42:46.500 --> 3:42:53.500]  where the human papillomavirus shot is killing or maiming or paralyzing people. I mean, we're just trying to tell the truth here.
[3:42:53.500 --> 3:42:55.500]  It's not enjoyable, I'll tell you.
[3:42:55.500 --> 3:43:01.500]  I totally agree with you. And it does. There's a personal cost that you and I both know.
[3:43:01.500 --> 3:43:06.500]  I wanted to ask you, Alex, if I can turn the table just for a minute.
[3:43:06.500 --> 3:43:12.500]  I'm really curious what you're finding out about this vaccine for the swine flu.
[3:43:12.500 --> 3:43:17.500]  And I'm sorry if I changed the topic, but I just got to ask you that question.
[3:43:17.500 --> 3:43:24.500]  Do you have any, I'm sure you have some strong feelings, but any advice on what we can do about what's coming down the pike?
[3:43:24.500 --> 3:43:33.500]  You know, there's so many pieces of political data, socioeconomic data, so many medical doctors and scientists and virologists I've interviewed
[3:43:33.500 --> 3:43:40.500]  and all the different perspectives. It's almost like I've over analyzed it to the point of we know it's a lie.
[3:43:40.500 --> 3:43:46.500]  We know it's a fraud. We knew in January they were gearing up for quarantines, mass graves, federalization,
[3:43:46.500 --> 3:43:52.500]  Northcom to put 400,000 troops on the streets. And we saw all these movements in January.
[3:43:52.500 --> 3:43:58.500]  I went on air and said, I believe it's flu related because emergency managers in Chicago and Indiana were telling me this,
[3:43:58.500 --> 3:44:04.500]  and in upstate New York, then I got secret documents and published them. And we said this isn't a drill.
[3:44:04.500 --> 3:44:09.500]  They're not using this just as a cover for federalization.
[3:44:09.500 --> 3:44:17.500]  The banks are financing this worldwide as kind of a way of they want a worldwide shut everything down during the economic implosion
[3:44:17.500 --> 3:44:21.500]  they're engineering in the fall that they're going to use this to clamp down.
[3:44:21.500 --> 3:44:29.500]  I said that in January, then in April, the flu popped up. We said regular flu kills over 36,000 people every year.
[3:44:29.500 --> 3:44:36.500]  Why are they fear mongering over a few deaths? Now it's over 500. Why did it come out in the wrong year?
[3:44:36.500 --> 3:44:42.500]  Wrong time of year, wrong hemisphere. Why? I had virologist on. It was in BBC News saying it's a manufactured flu.
[3:44:42.500 --> 3:44:47.500]  We can look at its pedigree and tell it just came out of nowhere. It's been engineered, part human, part bird, part pig.
[3:44:47.500 --> 3:44:57.500]  And so the question is, is it just engineered hype to get federalization in places of cover without a bunch of death and forced inoculations?
[3:44:57.500 --> 3:45:02.500]  Or is it a cover just to sell a bunch of vaccines? Or are they really planning? Do they know it's going to mutate into something more deadly?
[3:45:02.500 --> 3:45:09.500]  Vaccine trials in Europe have killed a bunch of people with different flu vaccines in the last year, namely bird flu.
[3:45:09.500 --> 3:45:20.500]  There's internal CDC reports that have come out admitting that this could cause that Gillian Bernays disorder and nerve degeneration and even death.
[3:45:20.500 --> 3:45:25.500]  That happened in 1976 with the same type of swine flu that popped up at a military base after inoculations.
[3:45:25.500 --> 3:45:31.500]  But people don't seem to be buying this. Remember back in 2002, they tried the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act,
[3:45:31.500 --> 3:45:42.500]  tried to order all first responders, nurses, doctors, police, firemen, 14 million total, the LA Times reported, to take these inoculations for smallpox.
[3:45:42.500 --> 3:45:46.500]  But then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it, so the whole thing fell apart.
[3:45:46.500 --> 3:45:53.500]  So they keep trying this, but usually when it's just a hype thing they're doing, they don't build up all these assets.
[3:45:53.500 --> 3:45:58.500]  And so I think it's an ace in the hole for them to release something else if they want.
[3:45:58.500 --> 3:46:03.500]  I mean, we know it's staged, but at a certain point then we know what they're saying is a lie.
[3:46:03.500 --> 3:46:08.500]  We know it's staged, but we don't know what their exact playbook is.
[3:46:08.500 --> 3:46:17.500]  Or exactly when. If I could interject too, one thing I really appreciate about you, Alex, is your personal research.
[3:46:17.500 --> 3:46:22.500]  I'm sure you have a team, but you have these facts right at your fingertips.
[3:46:22.500 --> 3:46:30.500]  And I think it's great on a variety of subjects that correlate. And the second point, I really appreciate that about you and your program.
[3:46:30.500 --> 3:46:40.500]  The second thing I wanted to say was that I could ask, I just asked you the other day, oh, you know, maybe 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:46:40.500 --> 3:46:44.500]  I mean, maybe the government was new about it or let it happen, you know.
[3:46:44.500 --> 3:46:48.500]  But what difference does it make, really? I mean, it's over with. It's passed just eight years ago.
[3:46:48.500 --> 3:46:59.500]  And I said, look, these same people, the puppeteers there, if you get the big picture, it's not over.
[3:46:59.500 --> 3:47:05.500]  And the sooner we wake up, the sooner we can do something to change our republic,
[3:47:05.500 --> 3:47:16.500]  to have this renaissance that we need to clean up these guys if we possibly can at this late date and stop them.
[3:47:16.500 --> 3:47:20.500]  It's not going to stop just by burying our heads in the sand and saying, you know.
[3:47:20.500 --> 3:47:27.500]  Exactly. I mean, every time I think about getting set up, getting put in prison, getting killed, and I'm not trying to get sympathy here, folks.
[3:47:27.500 --> 3:47:31.500]  I mean, I don't even tell you a tenth of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes.
[3:47:31.500 --> 3:47:35.500]  But I live in like a James Bond movie, but I'm not James Bond. I'm just an average guy.
[3:47:35.500 --> 3:47:43.500]  And whenever it's overwhelming or I wake up at 3 a.m., like, not even fear, but more just gripped by the enormity,
[3:47:43.500 --> 3:47:46.500]  I think about my children, but other people's children, and you're right.
[3:47:46.500 --> 3:47:51.500]  These sickos that did this are going to continue to stage events. They're going to continue to do wicked things.
[3:47:51.500 --> 3:47:55.500]  It wasn't George Bush that did this. It was the National Security Council.
[3:47:55.500 --> 3:47:57.500]  It was the private corporate takeover above them.
[3:47:57.500 --> 3:48:02.500]  You know, the CFR wrote manuals, how they needed big catalyzing terror events, and Cheney did.
[3:48:02.500 --> 3:48:03.500]  Right.
[3:48:03.500 --> 3:48:09.500]  And I'm in this. When I got involved 13 and a half, 14 years ago, I had no idea how deep it was, how bad it was.
[3:48:09.500 --> 3:48:13.500]  I was naive. I was just standing up to the Millerites of the Constitution.
[3:48:13.500 --> 3:48:16.500]  And now I realize I'm point of no return. I can't go back.
[3:48:16.500 --> 3:48:22.500]  Plus, none of us can go back. Even if people live in denial and say this isn't happening, you know, you can't go back.
[3:48:22.500 --> 3:48:24.500]  You can't go back once you know the truth.
[3:48:24.500 --> 3:48:25.500]  And I...
[3:48:25.500 --> 3:48:28.500]  That's right. Yeah, I felt the same way.
[3:48:28.500 --> 3:48:35.500]  When I learned about this, it was actually spring of 05 when I first saw World Trade Center 7 coming down.
[3:48:35.500 --> 3:48:40.500]  And the way it came down, I pulled up my stopwatch, you know, and I was reading and analyzing.
[3:48:40.500 --> 3:48:44.500]  And, man, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[3:48:44.500 --> 3:48:50.500]  And then, you know, I'm reading this, what was it, a PNAC report that came out in...
[3:48:50.500 --> 3:48:53.500]  Well, it came out just about a year.
[3:48:53.500 --> 3:48:56.500]  September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[3:48:56.500 --> 3:48:57.500]  Right.
[3:48:57.500 --> 3:49:04.500]  So just one year before 9-11, 2001, and I think, man, these guys are talking about American Empire.
[3:49:04.500 --> 3:49:06.500]  And they're not even, you know, hiding it.
[3:49:06.500 --> 3:49:12.500]  They want hegemony, domination, using United States military power.
[3:49:12.500 --> 3:49:17.500]  And they say we've got to have a Pearl Harbor-style event to do it.
[3:49:17.500 --> 3:49:20.500]  Pearl Harbor killed 3,000. 9-11 killed right at 3,000.
[3:49:20.500 --> 3:49:21.500]  Yeah.
[3:49:21.500 --> 3:49:30.500]  I mean, yeah, and so anyway, it hit me and, you know, a lot of my family now have awakened to this situation,
[3:49:30.500 --> 3:49:35.500]  awful situation really, but, you know, there's some things we feel that we are doing.
[3:49:35.500 --> 3:49:42.500]  It's not totally pessimistic, is that we're people like you and I are speaking out, doing what we can.
[3:49:42.500 --> 3:49:46.500]  And then, you know, I always like to encourage people to get food storage.
[3:49:46.500 --> 3:49:50.500]  And I'm sure glad I bought some gold and silver a few years ago.
[3:49:50.500 --> 3:49:53.500]  Gold just went over $1,000 an ounce.
[3:49:53.500 --> 3:49:54.500]  Do you see that?
[3:49:54.500 --> 3:49:55.500]  Yeah, I did.
[3:49:55.500 --> 3:49:57.500]  We told people to buy it when it was 300.
[3:49:57.500 --> 3:49:58.500]  I mean, wait, but we're not perfect.
[3:49:58.500 --> 3:49:59.500]  We try.
[3:49:59.500 --> 3:50:00.500]  And I buy gold.
[3:50:00.500 --> 3:50:01.500]  I've got guns.
[3:50:01.500 --> 3:50:02.500]  I've got food.
[3:50:02.500 --> 3:50:03.500]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[3:50:03.500 --> 3:50:12.500]  I just know that when you leave us in the final segment, I'm going to hit the news where top economists are in major news saying the dollar will probably die in the next two years.
[3:50:12.500 --> 3:50:14.500]  We will probably be like Argentina.
[3:50:14.500 --> 3:50:18.500]  I'm not the one saying that, but we knew years ago they were planning it.
[3:50:18.500 --> 3:50:25.500]  Professor, I'd like to have you back sometime just on your political beliefs and ideas because I found this very refreshing discussing it with you.
[3:50:25.500 --> 3:50:26.500]  Okay.
[3:50:26.500 --> 3:50:28.500]  Fire out the websites for folks.
[3:50:28.500 --> 3:50:29.500]  Websites.
[3:50:29.500 --> 3:50:35.500]  Let me start with a journal of 911studies.com.
[3:50:35.500 --> 3:50:41.500]  And that has over 100 peer-reviewed papers and then plus it links to our three major papers.
[3:50:41.500 --> 3:50:42.500]  Okay.
[3:50:42.500 --> 3:50:43.500]  We're almost out of time.
[3:50:43.500 --> 3:50:44.500]  Fire out the other.
[3:50:44.500 --> 3:50:46.500]  Oh, boy.
[3:50:46.500 --> 3:50:47.500]  Gosh.
[3:50:47.500 --> 3:50:51.500]  STJ911, AE911truth.org.
[3:50:51.500 --> 3:50:52.500]  Professor.
[3:50:52.500 --> 3:50:53.500]  Oh, one more thing.
[3:50:53.500 --> 3:50:54.500]  Quick, Alex.
[3:50:54.500 --> 3:50:58.500]  We're starting up as scientists for 911truth.
[3:50:58.500 --> 3:51:00.500]  That should be out here next week, I hope.
[3:51:00.500 --> 3:51:01.500]  Awesome.
[3:51:01.500 --> 3:51:02.500]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[3:51:02.500 --> 3:51:04.500]  What does humidity mean to you?
[3:51:04.500 --> 3:51:12.500]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[3:51:12.500 --> 3:51:25.500]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.

[3:52:01.500 --> 3:52:07.500]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:07.500 --> 3:52:13.500]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:52:13.500 --> 3:52:20.500]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:20.500 --> 3:52:22.500]  Well Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:22.500 --> 3:52:24.500]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:24.500 --> 3:52:36.500]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:36.500 --> 3:52:41.500]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one world government.
[3:52:41.500 --> 3:52:48.500]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[3:54:17.500 --> 3:54:23.500]  Thank you for watching.
[3:54:48.500 --> 3:54:59.500]  Alright folks, this is Ted Anderson stepping in for Alex. He asked me to just come in and remind everybody that he will be live on Sunday from 4 o'clock to 6 o'clock.
[3:54:59.500 --> 3:55:06.500]  He also, you know, been watching the gold and silver market and obviously if he were here today, he would say,
[3:55:06.500 --> 3:55:12.500]  I want to have Ted Anderson up to talk about what's going on in the gold and silver market. It's such a hot item at this point.
[3:55:12.500 --> 3:55:19.500]  Gold today is at 1,008. Seen a high today of 1,018.
[3:55:19.500 --> 3:55:29.500]  And interestingly enough, last Monday I was on the air with Alex and I was talking about how I thought that maybe very shortly
[3:55:29.500 --> 3:55:37.500]  I would be looking at a gold at 1,009 and figuring that that is going to be the bottom side of the market rather than the top side of the market.
[3:55:37.500 --> 3:55:46.500]  At that time, we're fluctuating between about 995 seeing a market peak of about 1,008.
[3:55:46.500 --> 3:56:00.500]  So far, we've hit $1,021 an ounce for gold. The market peak for the all-time high that has ever been before was 1,030, about a year and a half ago.
[3:56:00.500 --> 3:56:08.500]  Now with what's going on in the marketplace today, today I'm looking at the news and there's some positive signs of the economy.
[3:56:08.500 --> 3:56:13.500]  What does that mean? I mean, do we have positive signs of the economy for real?
[3:56:13.500 --> 3:56:20.500]  One of the things that I can say, indications that if the unemployment starts to go down, what you're going to see is you're going to see
[3:56:20.500 --> 3:56:24.500]  a further deterioration in the world markets and the reason is this.
[3:56:24.500 --> 3:56:31.500]  We created all this tarp fund, $700 billion, and of course it's turned into trillions of dollars now.
[3:56:31.500 --> 3:56:35.500]  And the printing presses have been running full speed ahead in Washington D.C.
[3:56:35.500 --> 3:56:44.500]  And with all that that's going on, the Chinese are very concerned, obviously in other nations as well, but the Chinese are the big one.
[3:56:44.500 --> 3:56:50.500]  Chinese are very concerned about the United States of Dollar and how well it'll hold value in the future.
[3:56:50.500 --> 3:56:54.500]  Now China has been selling us their goods and services. Well, we all know that.
[3:56:54.500 --> 3:56:58.500]  Everything's made in China nowadays, most of everything I should say.
[3:56:58.500 --> 3:57:00.500]  And we've been shipping a lot of dollars over there.
[3:57:00.500 --> 3:57:12.500]  So they sit on about $3.3 trillion of U.S. currency in the form of either paper notes itself, bank deposits, or U.S. government securities.
[3:57:12.500 --> 3:57:20.500]  Now China has been considering trying, you know, trying to lighten up their load and getting away from the U.S. dollar.
[3:57:20.500 --> 3:57:25.500]  And that's why you're seeing this U.N. coalition to form a basket of currencies.
[3:57:25.500 --> 3:57:41.500]  You know, once that really happens, the United States is doomed because the only reason why the United States has been able to enjoy prosperity in the last 20, even 30 years is because of the fact that we've been able to sell our debt
[3:57:41.500 --> 3:57:45.500]  to foreign countries. We all have heard that. We're selling our debt to foreign countries.
[3:57:45.500 --> 3:57:52.500]  We're able to take their earned money, inject it into our system, and keep our economy going in a form of a loan.
[3:57:52.500 --> 3:57:56.500]  Now we owe them all this money, and we have trouble.
[3:57:56.500 --> 3:58:02.500]  So what I do is call my this 1-800-686-2237.
[3:58:02.500 --> 3:58:07.500]  I have the Walking Liberty Haves. Alex asked me to hold those throughout the weekend. I'm gonna.
[3:58:07.500 --> 3:58:15.500]  They're still at 869. We have the Franks at 236. British sovereigns at 291.
[3:58:15.500 --> 3:58:26.500]  Take and move your money into gold. That's all I can say at this particular time if you're sitting there with cash, paper currencies, 1-800-686-2237.
[3:58:26.500 --> 3:58:30.500]  We'll hold these specials soon. Thanks for listening to The Alex Jones Show.

[3:58:51.500 --> 3:58:57.500]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[3:58:57.500 --> 3:59:01.500]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:01.500 --> 3:59:07.500]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[3:59:07.500 --> 3:59:12.500]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:59:12.500 --> 3:59:19.500]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:59:19.500 --> 3:59:22.500]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:59:22.500 --> 3:59:26.500]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[3:59:26.500 --> 3:59:30.500]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:59:30.500 --> 3:59:36.500]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
