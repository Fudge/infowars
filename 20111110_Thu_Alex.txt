[00:41.320 --> 00:47.400]  have the BBC slash ABC reporter investigative journalist Greg Paulist
[00:47.400 --> 00:52.840]  joining us to look at the state of the world the global economic meltdown in
[00:52.840 --> 00:57.720]  hindsight because back in 2002 he got the leaked IMF World Bank documents where
[00:57.720 --> 01:02.460]  the mega banks were planning to implode the West just like a third-world country
[01:02.460 --> 01:06.800]  and of course that's the final chapter in my out now out of print book to sent
[01:06.800 --> 01:12.280]  into tyranny predicting everything that then took place via those documents the
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.080]  books not out of print digitally it's available at prisonplanet.tv once you
[01:16.080 --> 01:23.520]  remember you can find it there and incidentally we're running a 15-day
[01:23.920 --> 01:28.560]  free trial right now at prisonplanet.tv where this entire radio show all
[01:28.560 --> 01:34.760]  three hours is transmitted daily the entire video five-camera shoot element
[01:34.760 --> 01:42.720]  and then of course the nighttime show seven o'clock central at prisonplanet.tv
[01:42.720 --> 01:47.320]  as well for prisonplanet.tv members but I I'm now digressing off into that
[01:47.320 --> 01:57.040]  area George Soros is running around profiting off the euro meltdown we've
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.400]  got Gardasil victims taking legal action against Merck over miscarriage and
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.320]  deadly reactions including deaths doesn't matter they've been given government
[02:07.320 --> 02:14.840]  immunity now UK foreign office Israel expected to attack Iran next month
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.360]  Rick Perry virtually ends his own presidential campaign with major debate
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.400]  gaff I should have covered this last week Jaron had all these clips of Perry
[02:24.400 --> 02:30.800]  in speeches not knowing really who he was and going oh hey dude Jaron called
[02:30.800 --> 02:35.160]  me in late at night or eight o'clock at night and says you got to watch these
[02:35.160 --> 02:38.640]  clips tomorrow we got to play him and then he showed me some of the clips I
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.720]  never got around to it where he was like dude and Jaron's like he's it's like
[02:44.720 --> 02:49.520]  he's on Prozac or something it's like he's drunk and and you see Perry without
[02:49.520 --> 02:55.960]  a teleprompter just going like he's like he's going crazy I think he's had a
[02:55.960 --> 03:02.800]  mental breakdown it's one thing all the time to be on air and say there's three
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.560]  agencies aren't you ever forget something but instead he's like I don't
[03:07.560 --> 03:13.480]  know what is this and they couldn't remember then suddenly he tried to say
[03:13.480 --> 03:19.000]  all three again he could he can only say one then went oh fudgel it does yeah I
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.440]  don't know nothing and Perry wasn't like this just six months ago George W. Bush
[03:28.440 --> 03:34.920]  gave pretty good speeches in Texas his hair was brown he was annoying a liar
[03:34.920 --> 03:39.760]  wicked but he could speak he was a decent speaker not great as soon as he
[03:39.760 --> 03:46.760]  became president or even when he was running it was suddenly making up all
[03:46.760 --> 03:52.160]  these weird words and of course Obama without a teleprompter is a
[03:52.160 --> 03:56.960]  bumbling idiot as well it's because these guys are total and complete puppets
[03:56.960 --> 04:00.880]  plus they're always being fed all their lines what they're supposed to say
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.760]  without a teleprompter they just go to pieces now all of that is a side issue
[04:04.760 --> 04:08.240]  compared to the plans to strike Iran and what that's going to do I'm gonna get
[04:08.240 --> 04:13.000]  more into that today the huge sell-off of the stock market yesterday but I have
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.080]  waited four days really five days to talk about the Penn State issue and I'm
[04:19.080 --> 04:22.800]  gonna cover that first when we come back from break because it illustrates
[04:22.800 --> 04:28.760]  everything I'm talking about how people are naive they're gullible
[04:28.760 --> 04:32.480]  especially when it comes to big powerful institutions and so that's where
[04:32.480 --> 04:39.480]  evil predators go because intelligent predators know that in government in
[04:39.480 --> 04:44.240]  big institutions in big corporations they can get away with more because
[04:44.240 --> 04:49.280]  nobody wants to see the organization go down believe me it's coming out the
[04:49.280 --> 04:53.960]  police knew everybody knew of course folks this is definitely a child
[04:53.960 --> 05:01.920]  raping I mean so's pretty much everything a very wealthy US citizen is
[05:01.920 --> 05:06.920]  predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.040]  more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way

[05:14.720 --> 05:17.800]  your health and your own family now this man has made some outrageous
[05:17.800 --> 05:22.160]  predictions of the years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.080]  predicted the collapse of GM Panny Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest small
[05:26.080 --> 05:30.320]  owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire
[05:30.320 --> 05:34.160]  prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for free

[08:04.440 --> 08:08.640]  on the GCN radio network
[08:15.280 --> 08:23.580]  it is Thursday the 10th day of November 2011 and I think a lot of you
[08:23.580 --> 08:29.160]  probably noticed that I've talked very little about Herman Cain in the last few
[08:29.160 --> 08:33.960]  weeks during this big scandal with all these women coming out saying that he
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.120]  basically sexually harassed them groped them implied that if they would give him
[08:39.120 --> 08:45.080]  sexual favors he would advance them now he sounds very credible in his
[08:45.080 --> 08:51.200]  response but the problem is he sounded credible when he told Ron Paul how dare
[08:51.200 --> 08:56.280]  you say I call your supporters dumb I never said that that's an internet rumor
[08:56.280 --> 08:59.760]  get your facts straight and laughed at Ron Paul we have the clips of him on
[08:59.760 --> 09:04.880]  radio and in his book saying exactly that let me tell you I mean he's a better
[09:04.880 --> 09:10.040]  liar than Bill Clinton when he said that I knew I had those clips during that a
[09:10.040 --> 09:13.600]  debate a few weeks ago but I had to go back and pull them up to make sure
[09:13.600 --> 09:24.080]  because he is one of the best liars I have ever seen now that said one woman
[09:24.080 --> 09:28.200]  worked for Axelrod some of the others constantly follow these complaints it's
[09:28.200 --> 09:31.840]  a business for some women out there certainly I've got a wife and two
[09:31.840 --> 09:35.320]  daughters and you know my grandmother my mother I don't like women being
[09:35.320 --> 09:41.760]  harassed I know there's pigs out there that do it but in the final equation I
[09:41.760 --> 09:49.160]  haven't really covered this because it is a distraction war with Iran is imminent
[09:49.160 --> 09:53.480]  a lot of people are trying to stop it from happening now it's admitted Israel
[09:53.480 --> 09:58.520]  plans to hit them at the beginning of next month they've backed it off that
[09:58.520 --> 10:02.680]  may not happen but I've got the stack of news British news US news Israeli
[10:02.680 --> 10:09.200]  Knesset saying the green lights on we're doing it that I mean folks do you know
[10:09.200 --> 10:12.280]  what's gonna happen if Iran is attacked they're going to shut down the
[10:12.280 --> 10:15.880]  Strait of Hormuz oil prices will probably double or triple some estimates
[10:15.880 --> 10:21.040]  are five times what they are now Iran has now come out and said they will
[10:21.040 --> 10:29.280]  strike all over the world they have said that they will strike all over the
[10:29.280 --> 10:37.320]  world with asymmetrical special forces teams every major government trains
[10:37.320 --> 10:42.200]  troops to do this sleeper cells and the globalists won't have a stage any terror
[10:42.200 --> 10:45.320]  attacks they'll be able to take everybody's liberties distract you from
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.280]  the big banks raping everybody all the corruption the cashless society mark of
[10:50.280 --> 10:54.680]  the beast stuff because they start a war with Iran Iran strikes back with
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.520]  guerrilla warfare and now you know why they're getting the highway checkpoints
[10:59.520 --> 11:03.360]  ready and now you know why they're getting all this prepared and and and
[11:03.360 --> 11:09.280]  even the Jerusalem Post haritz have reported that yet Nia who wants this
[11:09.280 --> 11:14.120]  war so he'll get politically reelected and the neocons have told Obama get
[11:14.120 --> 11:19.080]  behind this war and you'll get reelected we'll leave you alone what do you think
[11:19.080 --> 11:23.200]  Obama's going to do with fast and furious on his tail shipping the guns
[11:23.200 --> 11:26.840]  into Mexico the drugs back into the US oh yeah that's in several big papers
[11:26.840 --> 11:33.480]  Chicago Tribunal pass-up times not getting national coverage the Attorney
[11:33.480 --> 11:36.920]  General Holder blamed the second amendment he said pass gun control and
[11:36.920 --> 11:41.000]  this won't happen anymore Mexico has a total gun ban our government shipping
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.600]  the guns in he blames our second amendment for what he did I told you he'd
[11:45.600 --> 11:52.000]  do that all of these huge things are happening and we're talking about
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.240]  Herman Cain why not talk about Herman Cain and his support of the fellow
[11:58.240 --> 12:05.200]  reserve his support of new taxes why not talk about Herman Cain working for the
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.800]  Pillsbury family and skull and bones why not talk about his attacks on Ron Paul
[12:10.800 --> 12:15.320]  why not talk about how he's another establishment insider like Rick Perry
[12:15.320 --> 12:21.080]  Mitt Romney all these guys I mean Mitt Romney on record is for abortion gun
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.800]  control open borders amnesty cities carbon global warming taxes Al Gore
[12:26.800 --> 12:32.280]  praises him wrote Obamacare this is on record and he's the Republican front
[12:32.280 --> 12:37.840]  runner I don't know who's stupider Obama supporters supporting him believing he
[12:37.840 --> 12:41.440]  was gonna give you free houses and free cars like his idiot supporters thought
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.280]  didn't know he's bought and paid for with a big six mega banks that are running
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.800]  the New World Order or you Republicans because the media tells you Rick Perry's
[12:49.800 --> 12:55.720]  the leader for the last six months you go well he's better than Obama really
[12:55.720 --> 13:01.320]  really with Obama we know what we've got with Rick Perry because he's white and
[13:01.320 --> 13:06.000]  has I guess a good haircut and wears a nice suit looks like a kindle like a
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.840]  mannequin it at Dillard's or something or Macy's then you keep me looks like a
[13:12.840 --> 13:20.280]  guy in a in a in a Esquire article you know the in a wristwatch ad I mean you
[13:20.280 --> 13:24.920]  can go get any wristwatch model of the distinguished 50 something-year-old male
[13:24.920 --> 13:28.800]  or whatever and just I guess make him president it doesn't matter what their
[13:28.800 --> 13:31.600]  policies are it doesn't matter what they stand for
[13:31.600 --> 13:35.280]  oh Ron Paul he's got black circles under his eyes because he works 18 hours a day
[13:35.280 --> 13:40.520]  at 76 years old and jogs every morning and exercises and eats like a bird and
[13:40.520 --> 13:44.200]  there's totally right about everything and a constitutionalist and the godsend
[13:44.200 --> 13:47.120]  for this country we don't need him because because he doesn't look like a
[13:47.120 --> 13:52.960]  kindle he can't make baskets like Obama he didn't slick in his Harvard you know
[13:52.960 --> 13:56.640]  educated suit and everything you know Ron Paul didn't need to read off a
[13:56.640 --> 14:03.280]  teleprompter we don't want him we don't want someone real no and I hate to use
[14:03.280 --> 14:06.520]  it a Christ analogy they use that with Obama and said he's like the Christ
[14:06.520 --> 14:10.840]  remember that he's like Jesus you look that up but but it shows people don't
[14:10.840 --> 14:14.980]  want the good they want the bad sometimes it's like Christ the pilot says
[14:14.980 --> 14:19.520]  I find nothing wrong in this man and he says okay it's this holiday you're allowed
[14:19.520 --> 14:23.600]  to release somebody on this day crowd who do you want to release and they said
[14:23.600 --> 14:29.960]  give us Barabas some rapist murderer criminal miscreant dirt ball psychopath
[14:29.960 --> 14:36.880]  give us Barabas that's who we want give us Obama give us Rick Perry give us
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.880]  Mitt Romney give us Herman Cain give us give it to us give us at all Fetler
[14:42.880 --> 14:50.400]  give us Stalin give it to us it's what we want why do they always marvel that
[14:50.400 --> 14:54.520]  women like men that abuse them and act tough and treat them like trash at least
[14:54.520 --> 15:00.800]  some women do you know the so-called bad guy the tough guy not somebody they'll
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.240]  actually take care of their children they'll actually provide for them it's a
[15:04.240 --> 15:08.320]  sickness in this society now I'm gonna get into all this world news and the
[15:08.320 --> 15:15.520]  economy which is huge and we got guests coming up but now I will spend some time
[15:15.520 --> 15:24.120]  on Penn State now I waited to really talk about this I don't know on Monday
[15:24.120 --> 15:31.560]  and Tuesday I said this is gonna go much deeper than just one football coach
[15:31.560 --> 15:38.360]  because I've seen this before and I said the Texas Youth Commission on record
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.920]  even when the Texas Rangers found out about it and blew the whistle it was
[15:41.920 --> 15:46.120]  covered up and it's come out in state hearings that at youth commissions all
[15:46.120 --> 15:52.120]  over the state of Texas it's all over the country too they have children ages
[15:52.120 --> 15:58.600]  six seven eight up to 17 and that the parking lot fills full of the pedophile

[16:52.880 --> 16:57.120]  somebody into a coma and and and I'm sitting there looking at the guy I'm
[16:57.120 --> 17:00.320]  like this isn't a joke pal
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.040]  that's what this country's run by I keep telling you it's run by pedophile

[17:12.160 --> 17:17.360]  Bohemian Grove on record and have sex with each other they vanity Ferris
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.840]  snuck in there years after I didn't found the same thing people magazine
[17:21.840 --> 17:26.360]  that's what goes on there Richard Nixon told Harper's magazine it's the most
[17:26.360 --> 17:33.160]  GD faggy thing you'll ever see you can pull up Richard Nixon on Bohemian Grove
[17:33.160 --> 17:38.600]  Harper's got accused every died of you know back in the 70s interview you know
[17:38.600 --> 17:41.640]  that they'd made up that because they didn't publish the rest up till after he
[17:41.640 --> 17:46.000]  died and they just said oh here's the audio of Nixon I go the Bohemian Grove
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.520]  yeah there at San Francisco and up north of there I tell you what goes on there
[17:49.520 --> 17:56.680]  it's unbelievable I went for political power but it's terrible I I listen why
[17:56.680 --> 18:01.840]  do you think they want sex education of fifth graders and I've seen the books
[18:01.840 --> 18:05.400]  that mean federally they're trying to pass it now that has to be taught
[18:05.400 --> 18:10.400]  everywhere where they actually teach five and six year olds with books showing
[18:10.400 --> 18:16.880]  two men kissing two women kissing a man and a woman kissing I mean five year
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.320]  olds aren't even thinking about sex ten year olds aren't even thinking about it
[18:21.320 --> 18:25.000]  I mean they're innocent they want to run around and play hide and seek they want
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.240]  to they want to play with paints they want to play video games they want to
[18:29.240 --> 18:33.840]  I mean they're not but but you go to school and they just sit there and throw
[18:33.840 --> 18:39.720]  it at you and it's in all the studies show it the more condoms they hand out
[18:39.720 --> 18:43.360]  the more people get pregnant the more sex the more disease because it just says
[18:43.360 --> 18:46.440]  go ahead and do it and they don't know how to put a condom on or it breaks or
[18:46.440 --> 18:53.160]  whatever they know what they're doing it's a way for the government I mean I
[18:53.160 --> 18:56.040]  mean I've got a nine-year-old son I haven't even talked to him about sex yet
[18:56.040 --> 19:01.920]  he's not interested he doesn't care it's not some big hang up he's reading
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.680]  history books and stuff I mean I I mean I guess we've been out at the farm and
[19:06.680 --> 19:10.080]  you know seeing cows and stuff but it's more just scientific yes they make and
[19:10.080 --> 19:15.560]  then it's no big deal we don't make it some big hang up so he's not but but see
[19:15.560 --> 19:19.720]  they want to take your five-year-old and force this into him why do you think
[19:19.720 --> 19:23.400]  it's now coming out it's confirmed I have all the mainstream news admitting it
[19:23.400 --> 19:31.720]  that the police knew back in the mid 90s they knew all about it everybody was
[19:31.720 --> 19:36.960]  upset about it everybody knew and here's the key when we come back the
[19:36.960 --> 19:45.940]  degenerate students the the the the holy wicked and of course I don't want to
[19:45.940 --> 19:49.560]  judge these people but they don't care about all these victims they want their
[19:49.560 --> 19:54.440]  stupid coach back who is an accessory nobody say he's an accessory he knew

[24:30.680 --> 24:35.600]  case and that was what I was about to get to next what did I say on Monday and
[24:35.600 --> 24:39.680]  Tuesday when people asked me about this and called in I said the Texas Youth
[24:39.680 --> 24:46.440]  Commission it came out that they had gladiatorial fights with the older kids
[24:46.440 --> 24:51.320]  with all the elitists coming in all over the state and watching them fight in
[24:51.320 --> 24:57.600]  some cases with weapons in boxing rings that was in the news but then it all got
[24:57.600 --> 25:07.440]  shut down and that government officials big donors rich people judges and see
[25:07.440 --> 25:10.520]  what happens is once they know you're a pedophile and you've done this publicly
[25:10.520 --> 25:14.960]  with the elites now they can promote you into the power structure because they
[25:14.960 --> 25:18.880]  know they can destroy you anytime they want and it turns out the police knew
[25:18.880 --> 25:22.520]  about this more than 15 years ago I have the timeline right here and it turns
[25:22.520 --> 25:26.840]  out nine years ago there was a grand jury dealing with this and it was always
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.080]  shut down until now this is being brought out now to threaten the entire
[25:31.080 --> 25:35.960]  power structure just like the Herman Cain thing they always give you sex
[25:35.960 --> 25:41.040]  scandals and missing you know dead interns and all of this right before
[25:41.040 --> 25:47.000]  wars there's a huge distraction Taylor made they've got all these sex
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.440]  scandals right there they kept it quiet as the victims continued a mount and who
[25:52.440 --> 25:57.280]  was it disadvantaged children getting to go to the Penn State with the coaches
[25:57.280 --> 26:06.680]  who were going to mentor them and now what's the new reports that the coach who
[26:06.680 --> 26:12.960]  all these people say they witnessed doing this Sandusky headline drudges
[26:12.960 --> 26:19.240]  linking to it pimped out young boys the rich donors ladies and gentlemen you

[26:32.120 --> 26:37.800]  in the shower in a quasi public area doing this on his own you think the
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.720]  feds pay for a decade to put cameras in school bathrooms and in-girl showers
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.440]  and they were the straight face over the government we can watch your naked
[26:46.440 --> 26:49.640]  daughters and they share it all over the country that's come out in the news

[26:55.040 --> 27:00.200]  pedophiles then it's closeted gay men so they can use that on them then it's just
[27:00.200 --> 27:05.200]  hardcore sadist and and and then just mercenaries that want money but it is a

[33:02.680 --> 33:13.480]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting it's Alex Jones you know a lot of times I
[33:13.480 --> 33:18.640]  refuse to cover the big national stories if I think it's a bunch of fluff
[33:18.640 --> 33:23.760]  I'll give a brief comment like I've done on Herman Cain but you can't prove
[33:23.760 --> 33:27.080]  what's happening to Cain one way or the other and there's a lot of dirt on both
[33:27.080 --> 33:32.200]  sides I think he comes off very credible but the guy came off credible
[33:32.200 --> 33:36.280]  saying Ron Paul was wrong about him attacking Ron Paul supporters and folks
[33:36.280 --> 33:41.200]  that want to audit the Fed when he's on record on TV radio and in print saying
[33:41.200 --> 33:47.040]  it and I mean he's probably the best liar I've ever seen so but so I just
[33:47.040 --> 33:50.440]  don't go there I know where he stands on issues we don't need the federal
[33:50.440 --> 33:54.520]  government involved in sales taxes and VAT and they're gonna keep all the other
[33:54.520 --> 34:00.480]  taxes that's why I don't like Herman Cain on issues I can prove not on a bunch
[34:00.480 --> 34:05.440]  of witch hunts and let me tell you these Democratic operative women every one
[34:05.440 --> 34:09.160]  of them's got connections to it that I've seen and it stinks to I have it so I
[34:09.160 --> 34:16.080]  haven't covered that but on this Penn State situation I've been busy looking at
[34:16.080 --> 34:21.440]  what's happening in Iran busy looking at what's happening economically everybody
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.360]  who researches what's happening in the world is really freaked out right now
[34:24.360 --> 34:28.880]  everybody feels a disturbance in the force as Obi-Wan Kenobi would say or as
[34:28.880 --> 34:34.480]  the Bible would say a disturbance in the spirit my discernment is just alarm
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.960]  bells are going off and always they have these type of scandals that are brought
[34:38.960 --> 34:43.640]  forward and triggered you see you got to ask yourself well hey I'm gonna cover
[34:43.640 --> 34:47.360]  this because it illustrates the way the world really works on so many points of
[34:47.360 --> 34:53.680]  the compass it's a window and into the real world into denial into powerful
[34:53.680 --> 34:58.840]  groups into cover-ups into group psychology into tribalism into media and
[34:58.840 --> 35:08.960]  into why has it been triggered now I have the timeline here it goes back to
[35:08.960 --> 35:22.400]  1994 at least and it turns out the police knew as of 1998 and the university
[35:22.400 --> 35:26.520]  pressured them the reporters all got threatened I mean this is all in the
[35:26.520 --> 35:34.160]  news now and they were able to cover up and this guy was able to continue and
[35:34.160 --> 35:39.560]  and and here here's an even bigger issue I am hearing sports writers because I've
[35:39.560 --> 35:43.960]  been following this now more closely the last few days because it's such an
[35:43.960 --> 35:47.280]  incredible window into how the real world works as I just said they're
[35:47.280 --> 35:54.160]  actually saying we've got to continue the season we have you know the the coach
[35:54.160 --> 36:03.080]  shouldn't have been fired the head coach and this big mob I'll play a clip in a
[36:03.080 --> 36:08.480]  minute of students saying bring back the coach one more game they're not even
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.680]  worried about the fact that there's a university all of their board should be
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.960]  gone that was part of this the president it's not enough all of them all of the
[36:18.960 --> 36:25.560]  coaches undoubtedly I mean listen if I was a coach and I walked into the shower
[36:25.560 --> 36:30.520]  and I saw somebody raping a 10 year old child number one I would beat I would
[36:30.520 --> 36:35.320]  stomp the living hell out of them excuse me I mean believe me ladies and
[36:35.320 --> 36:41.320]  gentlemen who wouldn't I'm not some macho guy it's clobbering time that guy's
[36:41.320 --> 36:44.760]  gonna have a broken jaw and his nose is gonna be hanging off I'm gonna have
[36:44.760 --> 36:49.360]  blood coming out of my fist I'm gonna be hitting them so hard I'm splitting my
[36:49.360 --> 36:55.760]  knuckles but you know what I realized this in my watch the witness to it and
[36:55.760 --> 37:01.000]  I'm nothing special everybody should you're a hero I was into the Madeline eight
[37:01.000 --> 37:09.240]  years ago my son was about two so eight and a half years ago or so and this
[37:09.240 --> 37:14.720]  woman with her family starts choking I'm in the bathroom and I hear yelling I go
[37:14.720 --> 37:21.560]  to wash my hands I come back out and there's a woman with all these people
[37:21.560 --> 37:24.720]  standing around saying doll 9-1-1 and she's turning blue it's been going on
[37:24.720 --> 37:29.520]  about a minute while I've been in there and I say give her the Heimlich who knows
[37:29.520 --> 37:33.000]  how to do it of course I took it when just a little junior fire department
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.960]  thing not a full certification when I was on swim team the fourth year I was
[37:36.960 --> 37:45.040]  like 13 last year I did it I should have stayed in it man but the point is that I
[37:45.040 --> 37:48.440]  had to then start going well excuse me excuse me excuse me and they were going
[37:48.440 --> 37:54.920]  no no wait for police dial 9-1-1 everybody's dialing 9-1-1 and I and I
[37:54.920 --> 37:57.920]  said it'll take them on average 12 minutes to get here and I had to shove
[37:57.920 --> 38:02.240]  them in somebody start shoving on me and I get over to the woman she's now on the
[38:02.240 --> 38:08.800]  table purple this has been going on a minute and a half okay and they're going
[38:08.800 --> 38:12.560]  how dare you my god you're gonna hurt her and she's she's somewhat overweight
[38:12.560 --> 38:17.520]  she probably weighed 200 pounds and I stand her up I get her up and I do the
[38:17.520 --> 38:22.080]  Heimlich do it wants to do it try to do it hard she goes yeah and a big ball of
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.280]  bread with a little bit of vomit comes out and she goes and everybody's like
[38:27.280 --> 38:30.200]  oh you're a hero stay here and I knew this was a bunch of ninnies I'd probably
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.560]  get sued if I broke her rib or something because I had to really pick her up and
[38:34.560 --> 38:37.440]  I was like get out of here we're not even gonna finish eating let's go my wife's
[38:37.440 --> 38:41.560]  like why not like you're a hero you're a hero this was demonic ninnies I had to
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.200]  get out of there so so I don't understand it I mean I walk into a shower
[38:45.200 --> 38:50.840]  somebody's got a ten-year-old bent over raping them I mean it you I am going to
[38:50.840 --> 38:56.800]  stomp the daylights out of you I am going to I mean I'd be uncontrolled I
[38:56.800 --> 38:59.320]  guarantee it once I got you on the ground you're gonna get stomps I mean
[38:59.320 --> 39:03.160]  you're gonna get stomped stomp from the feet right up to the head like a
[39:03.160 --> 39:09.080]  kangaroo boom boom boom boom it's it's oh yeah you're probably not gonna live
[39:09.080 --> 39:14.680]  and so the issue here is that that's what my instinct says that's my gut I
[39:14.680 --> 39:19.600]  walk around a corner in the shower and somebody's raping a kid you're gonna be
[39:19.600 --> 39:28.080]  lucky lucky if I don't kill you okay I don't understand this culture now where
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.640]  they say one out of ten people will rush in during an emergency that's why I
[39:31.640 --> 39:35.800]  admire firefighters the men and women of firefighting I admire police I'll be
[39:35.800 --> 39:39.640]  honest with you the profession of a peace officer charging in against criminals
[39:39.640 --> 39:43.120]  charging into danger that's what humanity's all about that's why it's so
[39:43.120 --> 39:47.120]  evil it's been corrupted they haven't corrupted the firefighters yet and God
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.080]  bless them and I contribute to them and and give the volunteer fire departments
[39:51.080 --> 39:54.600]  as much as I can they're just great men and women and they're trying to turn them
[39:54.600 --> 40:03.600]  into spies against the people it makes me so sick but the fact that for I don't
[40:03.600 --> 40:12.120]  know what's 94 to 2011 how many is that 16 years 17 years how long is it 17
[40:12.120 --> 40:17.600]  years and this shows how corruption works how in mobs of people I'm sure a
[40:17.600 --> 40:23.200]  very small percentage of more involved in the raping of children but they knew
[40:23.200 --> 40:27.600]  and then for the system they cover it up and that's how the big mega banks works
[40:27.600 --> 40:31.040]  stealing tens of trillions that's how derivatives work that's how this
[40:31.040 --> 40:36.080]  plausible deniability works that's how this corruption works where the average
[40:36.080 --> 40:41.120]  citizen doesn't put their inspection sticker on a half inch to the right spot
[40:41.120 --> 40:46.640]  you get the book thrown at you or citizens do things that really aren't
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.280]  even illegal but a regulatory go to jail and the system throws the book at us
[40:52.280 --> 40:57.360]  microphones in the lamps post listening to us face scanning cameras total
[40:57.360 --> 41:01.080]  corruption and the attorney generals on record perjuring himself about shipping
[41:01.080 --> 41:05.040]  guns into Mexico and bringing drugs into the US and Janet Napolitano has been
[41:05.040 --> 41:08.520]  caught doing it they've all been caught doing it and I understand people who
[41:08.520 --> 41:14.400]  aren't evil find this hard to believe because you're naive good people have a
[41:14.400 --> 41:20.760]  blind spot believe me I had a blind spot when I was 11 years old and got off the
[41:20.760 --> 41:24.760]  bus in the cool 14 15 year old said hey come play in the fort with us in the
[41:24.760 --> 41:29.760]  woods and then beat the living snot out of me but see I had a wake-up call I
[41:29.760 --> 41:33.160]  thought all the cops were the best people in the world growing up till I saw
[41:33.160 --> 41:37.800]  cops dealing drugs where I grew up but you got to grow up sometime you know what
[41:37.800 --> 41:45.200]  I mean because being naive thinking it's cool to be naive
[41:46.200 --> 41:53.720]  behaving like that is what allows a Nazi Germany or a Soviet Russia or a
[41:53.720 --> 42:01.280]  communist China or an authoritarian Pol Pot or Chalcescu or any of these scum
[42:01.280 --> 42:05.240]  people think they can decide to not believe something I have people tell me
[42:05.240 --> 42:09.720]  that all the time intelligent people they go I choose not to believe that and
[42:09.720 --> 42:13.040]  I go but look at the facts I'm not looking at it I hear what you're saying I
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.080]  just can't believe that and it's the same thing I've talked about in
[42:17.080 --> 42:20.440]  criminology I study criminology a lot because it's a window into human
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.480]  activity and all of us are a little criminal at some level it's called sin
[42:24.480 --> 42:30.080]  it's collaborate behavior all of us you know you don't have some type of bad
[42:30.080 --> 42:36.040]  side just with some people it's it's all they are and people always go he was
[42:36.040 --> 42:40.120]  such a nice old man when they find 25 bodies buried in their basement or she
[42:40.120 --> 42:44.040]  was such a nice lady when they find you know dead kids buried in her in her
[42:44.040 --> 42:49.320]  basement or whatever people can't ever believe this and when you get a big
[42:49.320 --> 42:54.600]  institution like a university when you get a big institution like a big church
[42:54.600 --> 42:59.080]  or international church or you get a big institution like the Boy Scouts or a
[42:59.080 --> 43:02.800]  big institution like the state police or a big institution like the local
[43:02.800 --> 43:07.720]  police or a big institution like a college or the federal government you
[43:07.720 --> 43:14.800]  create a system where smart criminals and deviants know they can get away with
[43:14.800 --> 43:19.840]  things because once they have power in that position people are scared to go
[43:19.840 --> 43:25.880]  after them they can corrupt other people by just letting them know about it and
[43:25.880 --> 43:30.800]  then now they're accessories and they know that the system is geared towards
[43:30.800 --> 43:39.440]  defending that power structure and we've got this video clip when I saw this
[43:39.440 --> 43:44.560]  last night I was driving home at about 10 o'clock and I heard it on the radio
[43:44.560 --> 43:51.840]  on XM and I got home and I went and went online and found the clip was on CNN
[43:51.840 --> 44:01.120]  now over to ESPN to see the full other more expanded coverage online and there
[44:01.120 --> 44:05.280]  was people basically at the verge of rioting screaming you've got to bring
[44:05.280 --> 44:12.400]  back Joe Paterno you've got to let him finish the season and then this morning
[44:12.400 --> 44:16.560]  driving in I'm listening to press conferences on MSNBC and they've all
[44:16.560 --> 44:21.240]  with hushed breath is the games gonna continue you're not gonna cancel oh my
[44:21.240 --> 44:24.960]  god how are the team handling this who cares about the team who cares about
[44:24.960 --> 44:29.520]  stupid football you see this is why we're so sick people care so much about
[44:29.520 --> 44:34.360]  games they don't care about little kids getting raped they care so much about
[44:34.360 --> 44:40.320]  about all these things we've been trained to put our self-image our worth
[44:40.320 --> 44:47.800]  our identity into that don't matter I mean look at it some old man 84 years
[44:47.800 --> 44:53.200]  old all about him and oh my gosh what his career and all this and what's gonna
[44:53.200 --> 44:57.440]  happen to the team what's gonna happen to Penn State oh my gosh the donors it's
[44:57.440 --> 45:05.280]  sycophantic what we have become as a culture and of course of course reports
[45:05.280 --> 45:11.240]  are gonna come out about donors in there anyone who is reportedly and the
[45:11.240 --> 45:20.160]  evidence is overwhelming reportedly raping children in a fieldhouse bathroom
[45:20.680 --> 45:24.520]  this is what these psychos do in criminology when they get in these
[45:24.520 --> 45:29.280]  positions of power they do it more and more out in the open more and more in
[45:29.280 --> 45:34.040]  your face that's why psychos taught the police about their next crime and how
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.320]  the police are stupid they want to be caught subconsciously they want to
[45:38.320 --> 45:45.960]  flaunt what they're doing it's all about the ego trip and of course he was so
[45:45.960 --> 45:53.480]  confident he was reportedly over 17 years doing this knowing the school was
[45:53.480 --> 45:59.360]  going to cover it up knowing that the minute the head coach didn't go to the
[45:59.360 --> 46:02.520]  police the minute the president of the universe didn't go to police he had him
[46:02.520 --> 46:09.560]  as accessories and I'm sure it goes much deeper than that and I said earlier in
[46:09.560 --> 46:14.520]  the week this is probably gonna be like the Texas Youth Commission where good
[46:14.520 --> 46:18.920]  good men and the in the in the Texas Rangers found out that they a bunch of
[46:18.920 --> 46:22.960]  pedophiles work at these facilities or even bringing their friends in and they
[46:22.960 --> 46:26.400]  tried to stop it and they they tried to suppress the Texas Rangers they leaked
[46:26.400 --> 46:31.000]  it the head of the state police leaked it and you saw the legislature got rid of
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.600]  the head of the state police in Texas and the state police ten years ago were
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.160]  nice were friendly wouldn't violate your rights now they now they love to come
[46:40.160 --> 46:42.720]  over to you in many carry areas especially the Capitol treats you like a
[46:42.720 --> 46:46.720]  piece of trash the whole culture's changed because the state perverts in the
[46:46.720 --> 46:50.160]  legislature I went down there and bullhorned them during the storming the
[46:50.160 --> 46:53.720]  TSA thing and said I know a bunch of you were pedophiles and perverts that are
[46:53.720 --> 46:59.200]  being blackmailed I went into Perry's office and said these are the reports
[46:59.200 --> 47:02.880]  these are the rumors and that you know is that why you won't stand up for what's
[47:02.880 --> 47:05.080]  right
[47:06.440 --> 47:11.080]  Perry is having a meltdown right now he can't even hardly talk it's not just
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.200]  that debate last night jaren noticed that last week played me in the clips
[47:14.200 --> 47:18.960]  where he doesn't even know who he is my gut tells me that he's on a bunch of
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.440]  medication he looks different they look just six months ago and that people are
[47:22.440 --> 47:25.280]  threatened to bring stuff out on him and I think he's been told it's gonna be
[47:25.280 --> 47:31.520]  brought out just as something to throw on the fire as well oh we got paterno
[47:31.520 --> 47:35.560]  over here in Penn State we got Herman Cain we got Rick Perry all of this
[47:35.560 --> 47:39.800]  before the system gets ready to hit Iran and certain elements that want to hit
[47:39.800 --> 47:44.280]  Iran are saying you see what we're doing at Penn State and with Herman Cain you
[47:44.280 --> 47:47.520]  saw what we did with the Republic with the Democratic governor of New York who
[47:47.520 --> 47:51.680]  passed a law to take John's assets while he was visiting hookers almost every
[47:51.680 --> 47:55.280]  night but we got all of you under surveillance and if you got any dirt on
[47:55.280 --> 48:01.800]  your fingernails it's coming out come print a come print a come print a come
[48:01.800 --> 48:08.720]  print a you get it you comprehend it do you understand it I know I do I know
[48:08.720 --> 48:12.800]  exactly what's going on here I know exactly why Rick Perry looks like he's
[48:12.800 --> 48:18.080]  been run over by a truck I know exactly I mean that's what he looks like Wiley
[48:18.080 --> 48:21.640]  Cote after a rocks falling on him he's been flattening he gets up with stars
[48:21.640 --> 48:27.200]  around his head because when you're nothing but a narcissist built up on
[48:27.200 --> 48:31.560]  your image and you don't care about humanity you're not tied into God you're
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.480]  not tied into love you're not tied into honor when you're a political whore and
[48:35.480 --> 48:40.480]  you stop going up that golden staircase towards what you believe is heaven and
[48:40.480 --> 48:45.880]  you start seeing your fortunes fall you have nothing the wicked flee when none
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.680]  pursue so for all of you out there that wonder about conspiracies and wondered
[48:51.680 --> 48:58.320]  about corruption and wonder about evil here's another example of how they kept
[48:58.320 --> 49:04.600]  the Manhattan Project secret for five years with hundreds of thousands
[49:04.600 --> 49:07.880]  involved how they kept Gulf of Tonkin secret that it was a stage government
[49:07.880 --> 49:13.080]  event for 40 years how they kept the Tuskegee experiment shooting black men
[49:13.080 --> 49:18.040]  out with syphilis secret for 40 years they decided to tell you how they've
[49:18.040 --> 49:23.280]  all this stuff they just throw it in your face operation Northwoods was kept
[49:23.280 --> 49:30.440]  secret for decades and this was known by the FBI by the state police by the
[49:30.440 --> 49:37.680]  grand juries since the mid 90s and was in grand jury in 2002 this was known this
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.360]  was this was this was known and never in the national news because it wasn't
[49:42.360 --> 49:46.440]  time to bring it out right now Congress is being told you will destroy your
[49:46.440 --> 49:50.200]  political careers you will let the Super Congress bankrupt America you will
[49:50.200 --> 49:54.320]  bring in the world government you will set up the TSA checkpoints or we know

[50:16.880 --> 50:20.880]  pious lives then they go to others and they say you like to go to those parties

[54:36.240 --> 54:40.600]  told by the head of the university and others to keep his mouth shut about what
[54:40.600 --> 54:47.480]  was happening and the raping of children reportedly continued you couldn't get me
[54:47.480 --> 54:56.480]  to shut up about that for 80 trillion dollars my soul there's no price tag on
[54:56.480 --> 55:02.800]  it and people like wow that's really moral of you would you sell your eyes
[55:02.800 --> 55:07.720]  for a billion dollars and be blind most people wouldn't only morons would well
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.200]  if the eyes are so precious they're just windows of the soul what about your very
[55:11.200 --> 55:19.440]  being what about who you are I mean I get guilty about eating too much and
[55:19.440 --> 55:25.440]  every once in a while if I slam my finger in a door using profanity because I
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.800]  want to be a good person because I know I'm a fallen creature but I can't imagine
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.800]  these people that can in no such evils are going on and to watch these students
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.840]  sign themselves on to the evil they're young they don't know but they are
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.040]  certainly on a path of wickedness and it shows how divorced from reality they
[55:43.040 --> 55:47.360]  are that they ran around in a near riot for hours the Associated Press reports
[55:47.360 --> 55:55.280]  they have a video clip of it demanding that the coach be brought back and I
[55:55.280 --> 55:58.560]  mean this is insane out of respect to the families out of the fact that we
[55:58.560 --> 56:01.840]  don't know how high this cover-up goes now they're reporting that donors may be
[56:01.840 --> 56:05.520]  involved you know with the kids being hired out of course they had all these
[56:05.520 --> 56:10.240]  charity events for kids how many times you're about the charity head for kids
[56:10.240 --> 56:14.840]  programs being a pedophile where do you think they go how many truancy officers
[56:14.840 --> 56:18.600]  turn out being pedophiles how many school teachers look how many Boy Scout
[56:18.600 --> 56:22.680]  leaders Boy Scouts are one of the best things in America it's great it's
[56:22.680 --> 56:28.520]  Americano but you got to be honest about who wants to go try to take it over and
[56:28.520 --> 56:33.400]  you got to route this stuff out that that that this is a modern sickness and
[56:33.400 --> 56:38.600]  they're trying to sexualize our children as young as five years of age in the
[56:38.600 --> 56:46.280]  public schools and teach them about sex period it's wrong it's wrong and it's
[56:46.280 --> 56:51.000]  all sold as people's civil rights it is pure evil and that's why you're going
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.600]  to see more and more of this because we have a demonic pedophile sex cult at
[56:56.600 --> 56:59.480]  every level of this government I've studied it I'm gonna do a report on it
[56:59.480 --> 57:03.640]  tonight seven o'clock with a bunch of examples prisonplanet.tv we'll air the
[57:03.640 --> 57:06.640]  report tomorrow here as well so I'm gonna do it live tonight and they're
[57:06.640 --> 57:09.680]  getting all the stuff together right now to really show you the full spectrum
[57:09.680 --> 57:14.200]  of this let's go ahead and go to this video club here it is
[57:14.200 --> 57:17.600]  here are the students
[57:17.600 --> 57:29.240]  near riot bring back Joe one more game that's what the news reports they were
[57:29.240 --> 57:37.280]  chanting and you know I shouldn't say near riot they flipped over the news
[57:37.280 --> 57:41.640]  truck vandalized some stuff broke some windows out reportedly so I guess it is
[57:41.640 --> 57:47.040]  a riot well I tell you if that was a couple thousand people peacefully trying
[57:47.040 --> 57:51.160]  to assemble just to talk about freedom they'd have riot cops there shot gunning
[57:51.160 --> 57:56.680]  them with rubber bullets hi officer don't we have a first amendment boom but
[57:56.680 --> 58:02.520]  you want to go out and say give us our football game oh man yeah for yeah
[58:02.520 --> 58:06.960]  football coach that people are questioning whether he should have lost
[58:06.960 --> 58:15.040]  the rest of season but of course he should be he should be indicted as an
[58:15.040 --> 58:21.040]  accessory and an accomplice to the original crimes and the ongoing crimes
[58:21.040 --> 58:28.320]  and so should every one of the university officials involved but don't hold

[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.160]  can really break down all the illegal stuff and unconstitutional stuff the
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.960]  police are doing the courts are doing and pretty much their total ignorance of
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.440]  it and we're gonna have him back for a full hour in the near future it's just
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.760]  we keep procrastinating about getting him in I'm a fan of his research and his
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:18.360]  work and it dovetails with my limited research that dwarfs most people's but
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:22.120]  that's just because most people know nothing about their rights or courts
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:28.480]  their procedure or any of it so he's gonna be joining us seven a lot of the
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.680]  success in court cases around the state and just really is helping people there's
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.960]  a lot of patriot mythology out there but I like to get Larry B craft on lawyer you
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.080]  know who's one major national cases at the Supreme Court you name it I like to
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.840]  go years ago get
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:53.280]  oh what's his name I'm having a big parry moment George Gordon great guy I mean
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.640]  I like to have real people on Stuart Rhodes he's Princeton lawyer top of his
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:04.000]  class he's got the case right now for Rob do so in Pittsburgh for they just
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.520]  arresting robs up on a hilltop videotape and the peaceful students being
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.280]  arrested cuz nobody's out you know out loud outside under martial law and they
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:17.960]  come up and arrest him and then strap him down out in the rain all night at the
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.840]  at the prison and all the other stuff they did so you're being sued they don't
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.560]  care they took out a three million dollar insurance policy with these law firms
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:30.920]  knowing they were gonna violate a bunch of rights they don't care it's your tax
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:35.240]  money they're using to destroy this country and police should worry about
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.320]  violating somebody's rights cuz every time you do that you chip out more of
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.520]  the foundation you're standing on your family standing on I mean if you're
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.880]  allowed to run over people's rights do you think that's not gonna blow back on
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.160]  you do you think other people are gonna do that to you I see a lot of reports of
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:56.440]  cops firefighters government people having houses they've paid for taken
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.920]  even when they have the deed oh see nobody gave you a little special get out
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:07.520]  a new world order free card huh you see karma reput you so whatever you want to
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:15.640]  call it well comes around goes around what you do unto others they end up
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.640]  happening to you that's why you want to do unto others as you'd have them do
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:25.840]  unto you but it's real simple I use the swimming pool analogy if everybody
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:31.120]  started using the local swimming pool as a urinal or as a toilet it would get
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.320]  pretty gross pretty quick wouldn't it so it's kind of like if you go to the
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:38.320]  bathroom in the pool you're like ha ha ha nobody knows I'm doing this well
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.480]  everybody else is doing that too that's why those city pools I won't swim in them
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.920]  it's basically swimming in a giant toilet bowl and that's an example of
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.600]  society it's an example of litter one person throws out litter the other
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.080]  person throws out litter producing everybody's throwing out litter and
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.800]  you've got a disaster on your hands it's the same thing with corruption it's all
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.800]  just violent this person's rights you know cops have pulled me over before
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.360]  they can look there's no criminal record they're going five miles 10 miles up the
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.800]  speed limit they come up I'm polite they say mind if I search the car and I'm
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.520]  like do you mind if I search your house do you mind if I destroy everything this
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.080]  country stands for do you do you mind if I steal your children's future oh don't
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.000]  threaten my children I'm not threatening your children you're threatening my
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.800]  children and your children well what officer do you think I'm doing something

[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:50.000]  person pulling people over and trying to search their vehicles but you want to do
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.800]  something to me go ahead go ahead hey I bet that's a truck full of illegal

[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:07.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:19.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:39.640]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.960]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:00.240]  towns big cities power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely we're

[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.880]  stickers and the citizens rulebook for $99.95 it would normally be $369 and
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:45.480]  95 cents $269 plus off all of my films that are on DVD for $99.95 perfect way
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.480]  to get these and then give them as gifts to everybody you know you can take
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:55.320]  care of 16 people at once because a couple of these have two films in each
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.440]  package like order of death dark secrets or the police state film a lot of the
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.600]  films are three hours long like martial law it's really three films in one
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.560]  technically though we call it one film in game three hours of information I
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.000]  mean it's unbelievable you want a master's degree in the New World Order
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.520]  geopolitical system this is it right here and it's available until
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.000]  supplies last they ordered a bunch extra DVDs to do this but looks like they're
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.840]  gonna run out well before Christmas so if you want to advantage of that info
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.480]  wars calm and your purchase a small profit we make it's very meager supports
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.520]  everything we're doing here I had to hire two more people because we did the
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.040]  bumper stickers at cost you can look at what they were and what they are now
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.640]  different bumper sticker packages to help put these up in legal awful areas
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.200]  to help get the word out because you know they're setting up martial law and
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.760]  total police state and about start World War 3 I don't suggest you climb up on
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.360]  the billboard here in Austin that shows Colin Powell and Rudolph Giuliani come
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.280]  into town a bunch of confirmed liars to push their new order on us I don't think
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.680]  anybody should climb up on that billboard and spray paint war criminals
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.440]  on it again I don't think you should I'm serious but you should show your
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.720]  friends and family these DVDs and you should put these stickers on your car
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.400]  or wherever else is legal and lawful again ladies and gentlemen info wars
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:17.640]  calm or 888-253-3139 and we haven't gone up yet but I'll go up a little bit on
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.960]  the bumper stickers so we had to hire two more people just to get out those
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:26.200]  orders where there's so many orders coming in that we're gonna have to raise
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.040]  it a little bit because now it's we're losing money on these we can't do that
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.440]  we won't be here but I want to thank everybody for your support with the
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.520]  money bomb I want to thank everybody with your support spreading the word
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.320]  about everything we do we are becoming a dominant force and resistance to the
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.240]  globalist because of your help and I want to salute all of you okay until 45
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.840]  after so then we'll go to your calls is Greg Palace he really doesn't need an
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.880]  introduction for a lot of people he's a real investigative journalist I don't
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:01.160]  even necessarily agree with maybe 10 15% of his political views but I 100%
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.880]  believe in his analysis he really is an old-fashioned investigative journalist
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:10.400]  for BBC ABC he's done other made films best-selling author his new book his
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:16.080]  vultures picnic and pursuit of petroleum pigs power pirates and high-finance
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.240]  carnivores and there of course is Greg on the back he's about to join us via
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.160]  video Skype but before he gets into his new book and then I want to give his
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.640]  take on the world today and you know snapshots Iran Israel police state USA
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.360]  Obama I want to bring him back to my book is sent into tyranny which is just
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.800]  the last chapter is excerpts of my interview with him 2002 he gets all
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:45.000]  these documents from the IMF and World Bank he publishes some on BBC's top new
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.080]  show their 60 minutes equivalent and they say don't release the rest of them so
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.600]  those never got released we release some but he did see them all right around the
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.480]  time Joseph Sticklitz I guess left the World Bank Nobel Prize winner for
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:01.440]  economics also I think one for something else he's a two-time the point is he
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.000]  won't say he released them but whatever this documented how the IMF World Bank
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.280]  takeover countries how they bankrupt him by design through fraud and how they
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.520]  were going to do it in the West and palest now close to 10 years ago really
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.400]  predicted what was coming and so in light of that open-world government
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.160]  corporate government being announced as a solution to the crisis they created
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:30.320]  Greg breakdown in hindsight 2002 in those documents versus now what happened and
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:37.040]  then where you see us going and how it integrates into vultures picnic oh boy
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:42.920]  well actually chapter 12 is where it integrates in I had to go back into the
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:48.480]  documents when Greece exploded and sure enough I found the documents on Greece
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.000]  and in particular a memo from Tim Geithner who was our Secretary of Treasury
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.640]  Tim Geithner to Larry Summers who was our economic czar and these are the
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.960]  kind of typhoid Marys of Bank deregulation which got us where we are
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.920]  and it was their program to force all 155 nations who were members of the
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:16.680]  World Trade Organization into joining the deregulation media in other words
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:22.880]  everyone into the into the leprosy colony and it was a secret document and
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.160]  here's what here's what I find interesting they're ready to pull the
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.840]  trigger ready to pull the trigger but not until they called Geithner told
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.640]  Summers he had to call five banks for approval to move ahead JP Morgan Bank of
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:44.880]  America City Bank and of course we ended up there with Goldman Sachs and in my
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.040]  book vultures picnic by the way I have the personal phone numbers of all these
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.920]  CEOs I think Penguin my publisher thought that I had faked it it's the
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.720]  memo is right there and those numbers are live I'm sure they won't be by
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:04.800]  Monday when the book releases incredible what did I go ahead no so and so I
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.960]  actually and I had to authenticate some of these documents of course and many
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.240]  were authenticated by Joe Stiglitz who'd been head of the World Bank and now
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.040]  because his Nobel Prize he feels free I'm not head of it the chief economist
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.480]  he feels free to authenticate but the stuff from the World Trade Organization
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:23.560]  because of my position with BBC I was able to actually meet with the head of
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:29.280]  the WTO and he says the Frenchman Pascal Lemmy who was head of the big
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.280]  French bank Swesley days and he says we are not the cabal of bankers some evil
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.960]  duck cabal and I said okay well you're not a cabal but are tell me about these
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:45.600]  documents here and I pull them out and it really made him smile see in the book
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:50.800]  you know he is so basically he starts explaining it all the way these secret
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.000]  meetings all the bankers to reestablish the new world banking order where you
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.320]  know they have absolute stone control and the punishment that would be needed
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:04.720]  out to any country and they picked out for example Brazil if they got in the way
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.280]  of of the banks operating without control there's it's a one-way system it's not
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.040]  like there that there's no government involvement they don't want they want
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.280]  the government to back it up there's basically they want to have a casino
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:21.480]  where if they lose you ensure them if they win they say that they are job
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:26.240]  creators and they get to keep it so you actually see these documents in vultures
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:30.480]  picnic and you and then after by the way after I take the documents to the head
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.080]  of the world trade organization lay me get authenticated then I fly off to
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.840]  keto to meet with the president of Ecuador and show him the Ecuador
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.520]  documents to say which would stun him because he kept saying you know that
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.120]  there's he's an economist the president of Ecuador and he said you know I you
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.840]  know I think that there are secrets agreement between the big banks and the
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:56.240]  IMF and World Bank to rip our economy apart and of course he was derided as a
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.760]  conspiracy nut and all that and so I decided well I called the president and
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:05.000]  they brought me in and I showed him the documents I said you may be a conspiracy
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.880]  nut but of course you're a hundred percent correct here's the evidence so
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.440]  he took copies of all the material and he made them public in Ecuador amazing
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:20.840]  now Greg Palace now looking back and from that point looking forward where
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:26.080]  are the banksters the mega corporations today what's happening in Libya Iran
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:31.080]  geopolitically from your research why are they on the verge of attacking Iran
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:36.240]  what's your view on that well I think if they're on the verge of constantly
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:39.800]  rattling their sabers to keep the war machine greased or they actually attack
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.800]  or not made me we don't know it's important to keep the pot boiling it's
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:48.400]  important to keep people on the edge of their chair that the terrorists are
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.840]  coming to get you it's the Iranians it's some in the Libyans it's someone coming
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:59.680]  to get you they have to keep this this a very very lucrative war machine and
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:05.280]  terror machine going for example like right now I was just meeting with Greek
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:10.720]  with Greek journalists and there you know they're saying well the you know
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.520]  for example in Greece where the whole nation's on fire and now it's happening
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.320]  Italy and Spain Greece it was a crime scene and this is very important this is
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.800]  also in vultures picnic it's it's not it's not about lazy Greeks who sit around
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.640]  you know swilling Uzo and and and spitting out olive pits and they you
[01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.480]  know retire when they're 18 years old and they're just a bunch of lazy bums
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.920]  who want to live on pensions like posh is that's nonsense Greece is a crime
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.360]  scene there was a there was a deal cut between Goldman Sachs and the prior
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:48.200]  Greek government in which the Greek government handed them euros handed
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:54.880]  Goldman Sachs euros 2.3 billion euros Goldman converted them to yen
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:00.760]  Japanese yen and then reconverted them back into euros at a massive loss to
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:06.680]  Goldman which gave the Greek government a massive gain to cover up a deficit
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:11.000]  now Goldman doesn't lose money especially not deliberately so they're
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.800]  not stupid they're stupid like foxes it was a phony transaction for which
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:20.800]  Goldman was paid over a quarter trillion dollars so for one little
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.440]  transaction every senior partner of Goldman got a little extra million for
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.440]  their weekend and but the result was that of this flimflam when it was
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.600]  uncovered is of course the economy simply imploded and Greece has to pay
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.720]  something in the area of 9% above normal to borrow money on the euro no one
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.280]  could survive that and so what we and then we're told it's the Greek people
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:49.000]  that's the same model we've seen in Argentina and Nigeria and everywhere
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.240]  else it's the same Bankster model so I want to hear you predict as you did nine
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.400]  years ago where we're now going to go in the future how does Greg Fallon see all
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.440]  this shaking out in the economy stay with us making the right decisions is a
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.200]  challenge to investors are we going to see economic growth slide into a
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:10.640]  recession or at worst depression hi Ted Anderson from Midas Resources we all
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.360]  know when a company acts irresponsibly divesting ourselves in a move towards
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:18.720]  safety is prudent when the market becomes volatile US Treasuries are a safe haven
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.600]  but what do you do when the US government overextends itself and spends
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:26.360]  beyond its means many investors are turning toward gold is a common sense
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:30.400]  alternative to traditional paper investments Midas Resources has put

[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.680]  what you think about Penn State listeners the students most of them not
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:24.000]  caring and saying keep the coach who cares how could they cover this up for
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.160]  16 17 18 years Greg I want to get into world events with you and now where you
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.400]  see the world going because you accurately from your research predicted
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.960]  but just briefly in one minute I see this whole Penn State thing is another
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:43.960]  window into how institutions inherently when they compromise at any level with
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.800]  integrity pretty much degenerate into total corruption I mean is this not an
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:55.080]  example of how how how corruption and institutions can just grow yeah it's
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.560]  not about football it's about money this is a big money center in this area so
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:04.600]  it's always the story of the money it wasn't you know they were covering up
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.840]  because this was a big profit generator and it was a big profit generator also
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.840]  used by local corporate big weeks to you know to impress their clients etc so
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:20.280]  basically it was protected by the by the the pool of the big boys it's always a
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:26.040]  money story and as soon as money as money poisons any type but if they to
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.640]  burn the pervert if they to burn the pervert instantly it wouldn't have been
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:33.920]  any big deal why the crooks and the corrupt why do the elite always think
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:40.160]  covering something up protects them because they're used to it they have
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.000]  impunity they have complete impunity well I for example in vulture's picnic I
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.960]  have a story of Steven a cone right the guys were seven billion dollars by the
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.560]  way I shouldn't call it vulture's picnic I should call it job creator picnic
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.680]  right that's their new names for these billionaires you know what does this guy
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.880]  do for living is he created job that he knows he's made seven billion dollars by
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.720]  investing in stocks when we invest he's a speculator he seems to know which way
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.880]  stock will move before God does you know what I did that I cut to the chase I
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:14.720]  found the ex-trophy wife right comes to me with the files with the pillow talk
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.040]  yeah you know what he's he's he's really smart he's smart enough to know how to
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.520]  buy the information so he knows which way stock is going and for the entire
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.920]  stock market your book shows this now at the top is an inside game just like a
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:33.160]  casino yeah I mean they've got their thumb on the wheel the cards are marked
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.880]  and the thing is it's no there's no such thing they say well what do we care the
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:40.840]  answers there's no such thing as a victimless billionaire when a guy like
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:46.840]  Cohen makes seven billion dollars it's because you lost it he was selling
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:52.520]  stocks he knew would blow apart to pension funds railroad funds railroad
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:58.680]  pension funds teacher funds he was buying stocks off small investors who had no
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.520]  idea that some stock was about to be the the target and instead of him going to
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.040]  jail we bail out the derivatives and then go into debt for them so so what
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.720]  should happen to these people where is it going to end I mean just like Penn
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:17.480]  State are there crimes invincible well it seems to be I got to tell you when I
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.280]  heard when I went through and got the Goldman scam with the Greek government
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.280]  in the old days and remember I used to be a government racketeering
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.000]  investigator well we would read people their rights and and handcuff them and
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.680]  walk them out of the buildings and now these guys get bonuses and they're
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.280]  arrogant of they're so arrogant about it they know that no one is going to touch
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.400]  them you know Obama said when the Jamie Diamond of JP Morgan was given a
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:49.320]  gigantic bonus off of our bailout money Obama and someone raised it Obama said
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:53.440]  well why should we punish Jamie Diamond well if you don't know that Obama why
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.360]  are you president and you know and the answer and the other questions why
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.560]  doesn't why is Jamie Diamond punishing us with our money well that's my next
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.200]  issue Greg is as you know elaborate on this they have Goldman Sachs and others
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.160]  have gotten their people in every top regulatory position so where you were
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.960]  that and it's putting people in jail years ago get should have mentioned that
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:20.480]  now they've put their own alumni yeah I mean the in Greece when you're talking
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:26.520]  about this flim flam and remember that American investors were scammed here
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.800]  for billions for billions okay for billions instead of going to jail
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:37.760]  Goldman Sachs put their own man in now as as the new head of the Greek economy
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:44.320]  so you commit the crime and basically these are the guys who benefit from the
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.600]  fire sale and they've set the fire and they are now buying up all these assets
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.720]  all over Greece and Spain and Italy as these governments are I've been told
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:58.880]  the only thing you could do is sell off everything you own and they're picking it
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.280]  up for peanuts they're devaluing these people's currency so they cannot buy
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.640]  their no no no Max Kaiser Max Kaiser was in Greece went into another hotel and
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:15.680]  there was Forbes and Steve Forbes and he bragged hey this is a great deal he
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.760]  knew Max from when he was a stockbroker he said this is a great deal we're gonna
[01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:22.840]  butcher this country and take the whole thing over for pennies on the dollar
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:26.880]  yeah they're tearing they're tearing it apart like they're ripping off turkey
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.200]  legs and chewing it to them I mean it's the best deal I mean basically you have

[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:33.080]  but and once I've had a chance to read it again it just came in two days ago
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.600]  and I've already scanned over it looks like one of his best don't forget
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.360]  tonight I'm gonna have a special expose a going back over the admitted pedophile
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.160]  scandals in Republican administrations mainly and at the bohemian grove where
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.440]  the Republicans are at you know I'm not a fan of the Democrats either Bill
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.040]  Clinton you know raping women settling rape cases and the rest of it and Barney
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:58.080]  Frank certainly underage callboys Democrat but with Republicans it Greg
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.480]  let me bring that point up before we look forward where this whole global
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.800]  systems going as you stare into your tea leaves or crystal ball there from your
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.680]  research as an investigative journalist former federal fraud investigator
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:15.520]  being you name it what do you make of the reason that I mean or you might
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:22.760]  disagree that there is such a history of pedophilia and and and also closeted
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:28.760]  gay sex by so many Christian conservative leaders and and and mainline
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:35.600]  Republicans what's happening there you know what I I'm an investigator and I
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:39.320]  always follow the money I know it may seem odd when you're talking about you
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:44.280]  know you know you know personal perversions but the thing is is that
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:49.760]  it's amazing how much those with power and money believe that they are immune
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.280]  from the rest of the rules moral and legal that bind the rest of us there
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:59.040]  isn't there's an actual sense when people get into stratus you know the
[01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:03.760]  stratosphere of finance as we see or those who hang out with them like the
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:10.200]  politicians who are their toy boys that they actually feel immune and and when
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:13.160]  you meet these people and by the way I went to the University of Chicago with
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.680]  a lot of these sharks I was actually student Milton Freeman so I know these
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:20.480]  guys and they actually feel that they're kind of the the ubermench that they are
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.680]  Superman above the laws that apply to you and I so if they have urges or
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:29.280]  desires that that's you know that they're different than you and me but I've
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:33.760]  never had those here's the deal I've never had those urges so I don't
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:39.760]  understand why it pops up so much with this group I mean this is something's
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.520]  wrong with these people's when I'm saying it's it's well you know it's very
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:51.080]  interesting because I go back to Chinatown where of course the the evil
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:55.200]  head of the power and and water company and believe me I know some of these
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:03.400]  guys you know he in the end of the film he has raped his own daughter and and
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:10.640]  his line is I did it because I can and it's almost a kind of perverse joy that
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.080]  they that they are different than the rest of us now it's true I don't I must
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:18.620]  admit I mean it's hard for me to understand cuz I mean I'm not claiming
[01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:23.800]  any special high moral ground but I just don't have such strange urges but
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.920]  I'll tell you this it's almost like they live in this perverted world if you've
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:34.160]  just shafted if you just shafted the entire Greek nation then picking up a
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.960]  seven-year-old boy may just seem like an appetizer to you I think you know I
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.080]  think that's it I think Greg Greg Greg I think you've hit on something here I
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:47.000]  think they are morally spiritually bankrupt and it's that they've done so
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.320]  much evil they're cursed with all of this stuff that they're into I think you
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.760]  just hit it and you look at sociopaths psychopaths shatest other groups that's
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.920]  the only time they feel alive is when they're doing something really twisted
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.980]  I think well obviously you're a criminologist you fit the nail on the
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:08.560]  head there yeah I think that what this whole sense of impunity and almost the
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:13.320]  desire to prove that you can get away with something almost a childish when
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:17.600]  you meet these people it's almost a sick childish desire to kind of push it
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.560]  into your face which is what's happening now when I see when I see when you
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.280]  read these documents it's almost like they they're daring you like I say in
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:33.120]  chapter 12 of Vulture's picnic and then also like I'm feeling right now with
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.080]  investigating one of the biggest donors to Republican Party who's spending his
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:43.040]  time you know basically stealing all the money for AIDS medicine in Africa now
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:47.760]  when you pull a stunt like that what is your moral you know is there any moral
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:51.920]  limit is there anything you won't do I just was in Congo last week or there's a
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.040]  cholera epidemic and the guys taking their their money away for the clean
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.720]  water that they need to end the epidemic once you get that I mean heck you know so
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:06.840]  you know so where are they going so to me yeah yeah so so so where are they
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:12.880]  going then well you know it's hard to say because like you take a guy like Paul
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.760]  the vulture singer and one of the characters of all just picnic and I
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:19.960]  didn't call him vultures the old the bankers who work with him and a profit
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.960]  from him call him the vulture maybe his mother does too it's like there is no
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.880]  end that is they he's worth about four billion dollars why is he continuing this
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.760]  what does he need that extra money for I'll take Charles Koch you know I did an
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:40.560]  investigation of him years ago and from the Koch brothers he was skimming oil
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:45.080]  off the Osage Indian Reservation you'll really like this one Alec this is this
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:50.040]  is where you'll you'll it's in vultures picnic we have a tape recording of him
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:55.040]  that I got from an FBI agent and one of his chiefs is asking why he's stealing
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:00.080]  money from the Osage oil Osage Indian Reservation it's about a hundred bucks per
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:06.160]  native in the native and the Indian own wells he's already a billionaire why's
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.360]  he taking a hundred bucks from a poor native and the answer Koch says himself
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:20.440]  I want what's coming to me and that's all of it there was he there's no moral
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.120]  limit it's like it's almost like he's got the billions he's gonna steal another
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:31.600]  hundred bucks from some poor Indian you know so and then you ask well so some
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.400]  weird perversion that crosses his mind you know to him it's just ordering another
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:41.240]  appetizer off the menu yeah it's amazing and and and you know these these
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:49.040]  globalists have sold us or attempting to sell us their worldview that tortures
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.280]  good secret arrest but you know looking at George Soros I've seen the 60 minutes
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.320]  piece we're always heard about it but actually saw it last year we played it
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:02.360]  here from ten years ago and he says was they say so you help round up your own
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:06.520]  people and give them to the Nazis and take their property yeah and he goes and
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:09.920]  I learned a lot from that if I wouldn't have somebody else would I'm proud that
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:15.440]  I'm a survivor and it just it just shows some kind of psychopathic disconnect
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.480]  because you know you tend to usually go after the right-wingers but what do you
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:25.840]  think of Obama being financed by the very same people and the whole political
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:29.680]  field right now I mean what do you think about the Democrats well I have to
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:32.960]  tell you that if you read vultures picnic you won't think I go after these so
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:37.160]  called right-wingers anymore that is Republicans because I actually traced the
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:42.240]  big evil to the Clinton administration Robert Rubin and the disease of you
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.200]  know basically it was a criminal act deregulation understand what Robert
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:49.880]  Rubin did he's secretary of the Treasury against everyone every intelligence
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:56.680]  person's warning he demands that the casinos the investment banks be allowed
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:01.400]  to merge and mate with the commercial banks which we you and I ensure where
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:07.800]  we put our savings he goes off within five months he's co-chairman of one of
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.800]  these new combined monsters of Citibank he has given a hundred and ten million
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:18.480]  dollar fee now I'm sorry when you change the law and basically bring down the
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:24.040]  world economy and you get a hundred and ten million dollar fee that makes you a
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.920]  monster now a registered Democrat monster but a monster sure sure exactly
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:33.760]  and the same group financed Bush and the same group it's financing Obama so
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.760]  that's the issue for those that don't know explain to them about the derivatives
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.720]  you get rid of glass steel he changes the regulations now the investment banks
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:46.720]  that create all this toxic made-up garbage they can now get it basically
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:51.880]  government backed like the citizens money and then the contagion spreads
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.760]  through anything now they hold his hostage saying give us unlimited trillions
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.080]  and make us the bosses of the globe even more or will bring down the world
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.800]  economy and now we're held hostage and I think that's why they're so arrogant
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.040]  yeah and the thing is is that they have brought that we've paid them about four
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.120]  trillion dollars and subsidies for trillion and they still brought down the
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.320]  world economy it's not like we got anything back for it I mean I'd almost
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.880]  say okay you know when they say well you too big to fail you gotta you
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:23.760]  realistically have to bail out the banks well how about bailing us out and
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.480]  you know what did we get in return and they are you know like Goldman for
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.480]  example and by the way most of golden money went to Democrats not to
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.120]  Republicans Obama got about four to one a finance money over McCain so I mean
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.680]  that what's happened now is that they're used to you know the Democrats
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.920]  used to try to pretend to be the party of the people the pretense is gone
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.760]  everyone's in the pool and now now they're all fighting for that finance
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:56.200]  and shark and vulture money and that's the problem that there is no alternative
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.480]  you either have you know the the party owned by the bankers or the party
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:05.440]  rented by the bankers and that's kind of your choice so do we just stay on this
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:10.480]  business do we stay on this express elevator to Hades with these people or
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:14.560]  is there a way to get out of it I mean how do you and your gut well see it
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:21.600]  going I think it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better because when you
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.680]  see basically they could burn down Greece and and remember they're gonna
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:29.760]  have a vote on by the Greek people which is the cradle of democracy imagine
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.040]  allowing a Democratic vote on whether the bankers should be bailed out remember
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:38.440]  all this money goes to the bankers not one penny to Greece 180 billion euros
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:44.680]  that's a half a trillion dollars half a trillion all goes to the bankers the
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:47.920]  Greek people are have to pay it off by selling everything that they have if they
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:51.600]  can do that there they can do it in Los Angeles they did it in Ecuador they you
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.200]  know they did it in Argentina but those people rose up they tried in Brazil they
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.480]  couldn't they couldn't get away with it very long but people had to go through a
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:04.840]  very bad time you had doctors eating out of garbage cans looking for food this is
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:08.400]  where we'll have to head first and then we will react as they did in South
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.760]  America and say enough of this stuff but I think it's going to get a lot worse
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:15.760]  before it gets better because there's no there's a consensus among all the
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:20.800]  political powers that this is the only way it could be they are too big to fail
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.440]  and too big to jail and there are a bunch of crooks they're confident the
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:29.440]  world is their oyster they get they can set up a domestic police state to
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.920]  suppress any political justice being brought at them and so we basically have
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:40.320]  a hitlerian fascist group of thugs squatting on us who are on complete
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.240]  power trips the sky's the limit Greg in closing folks and get the book and
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:47.600]  pre-order it now on amazon.com and we'll have you back up in the near future if
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.480]  ever comes there awesome we love to have you send a car to get you heavy in
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:56.600]  the studio but in closing it's now coming out the DA NBC's reporting who
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:04.600]  never charged the reported child rapist has been missing since 05 it's now
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:09.640]  turning out other people are missing who were involved it's they're now seeing
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:15.200]  donors the word is and they're investigating it we're in there
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.600]  buggering the children and that fits in with the Texas Youth Commission in this
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:25.280]  in this pervert pattern that we've seen where he was doing it in the showers I
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.040]  guess because that makes it more fun as you were saying these in criminology
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:33.960]  that they like to flaunt it and now it turns out there were secret deals to
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:39.840]  cover it up in the school that's now confirmed that's coming out of NBC and
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.720]  ABC as a former federal investigator long-time award-winning investigator
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.040]  journalist your gut you know your cop knows or investigator knows what do you
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:54.600]  think what do you just as a gestalt what is your nose pick up out of this
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.760]  Penn State thing because mine tells me and I said this on Monday this goes a
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:04.360]  lot deeper well number one if you think it's one place what this is some
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:11.440]  special perverted hole I I'm afraid that now the elite has decided that you
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:17.160]  know there's nothing left to buy except impunity and and not only for their
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:22.360]  worst urges but almost like they urge each other on to be more perverse than
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.760]  the next it's almost like you know you can only have so many trophy wives so
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:33.280]  now you have you have your your seven-year-old prostitutes I mean it's I
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:37.360]  think that you know it's maybe just the new trophy that they have it's you know
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.840]  the new because you can only have so many Gulf Streams you have to understand
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:44.560]  how much money is flowing around that never we never saw this we haven't
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.200]  seen this since the 1890s and so there's absolutely no limit and believe me it's
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:55.240]  not one college you know and you know that Alec it's always it's it there's
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:58.240]  one in there and they're stopping on it that's why they're throwing people out
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.560]  he's resigning he's resigning he's starting they they want to die they want
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:09.200]  to be one one isolated event it's not what percentage from your research of
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:16.480]  people are depraved criminals oh I haven't done an analysis the industry I
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.480]  can tell you this but of corporate chiefs I have yet to find a corporation
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:27.080]  that I've been asked to investigate not one where felonies aren't rife we've
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:31.480]  just set up a system we've set up a system that basically if you can steal
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:39.440]  enough you steal you steal impunity I've talked to a lot of folks don't want just
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:42.480]  a lot of people that went to business schools like you did the prestigious
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:45.840]  Chicago School of Business I've talked to others and they say they actually
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:50.280]  teach kind of you know at the graduate level off to the side when they're off
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:57.200]  having beers with a professor if you're gonna steal steal big yeah I mean and in
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.480]  fact they don't think it's a crime they think the rest of you are just a bunch
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.400]  of you know fools that they play you know they think that you're very
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:09.480]  unsophisticated you know like what my professors are saying like with Steve
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.200]  Conan is inside or trading they say that's not really a crime that's not
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:17.720]  really a crime well you know what if someone is selling you stock they know
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.440]  it's gonna blow up in your face and it goes in your pension fund or they skin
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:24.560]  you for a stock and that you're offloading because you think it's
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:28.080]  worthless but then there's really gold in it and they know it because it's all
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.760]  fixed it's fraud I'm sorry that's not a victimless crime it's fraud and it's how

[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:47.160]  that's what when I was there with these guys in school and I know them that's
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.520]  what they were taught that you know unsophisticated rubes like you just don't
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:54.520]  understand how the system works and but in the long run you should be grateful
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:59.880]  that they have that they have made a wonderful planet for you and if it
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.600]  weren't for them there would be no economy that's their that's their own
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.680]  fantasy their own creation myth that they are the gods who've created this

[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:01.440]  because their their stock investments on average of what had half their value

[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:00.240]  good people that post our stories and have come to our aid shows that there is
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:03.200]  still a lot of good people in this world in fact we are the majority doesn't mean
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.240]  we're perfect but our hearts are right we love God like King David did a lot of
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:11.320]  bad things he wasn't perfect but he repented and he was a good man at heart
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:17.000]  and God said you're a man after mown art and we need to not be naive and
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:23.480]  recognize as a society just how corrupt things have gotten if you studied
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:28.600]  history folks then you see the signpost and I've been a novice historian and
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:32.040]  let me tell you when you know history you see what's happening it's like danger
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:38.000]  I just got chills literally danger will Robinson Mike Adams sent me a text the
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.480]  other day and said you know I feel a disturbance in the force he said I've
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:45.640]  never felt this much anxiety about what's going on and at times in the past
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:49.040]  when I had anything near this bad stuff happened well they're trying to start
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:54.840]  World War three potentially I mean it's crazy we've allowed criminals to get
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.800]  into positions of power everywhere and recruit more crux they want the power
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:04.520]  good people don't want it that's the problem we have to be the light and
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:10.800]  salt in the world and we have to not be naive about what's happening let's go
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:16.920]  to Carl in Oregon thanks for holding Carl you're on the air my brother Alex
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:22.120]  hey remember me I was Carl from California I think I recognize your voice
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:29.400]  welcome hey brother settle here for about a month now I have to report that the
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.320]  resources are much better here in this state although it's not perfect the
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.520]  difference between California and Oregon is like there was between night and day
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:42.880]  we had the of course you know the occupied protests going on I live in
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:48.080]  the city of Portland so I'm close to to the action at near ground zero we had
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:52.520]  Mitt Romney come here and we protested against him that war criminal
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:58.040]  Condoleezza Rice came here we protested against her and yeah Michael Moore came
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:02.360]  well we just sat back when he came we didn't have much to say about that we
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:09.720]  did not I was kind of kind of humorous but just want to let you know that still
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:15.280]  plugged in took a few days to get through I went I had an idea I wanted to
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:21.680]  share with you I've seen this movie called the zeitgeist yes and I watch
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:28.960]  all but the most fascinating part of the of the program was the addendum talking
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:34.640]  about a resource-based economy instead of a monetary system what do you think
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:39.080]  about that and what's our chances that we can turn this around if we switch to
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:45.360]  I'm not against getting off the fiat money system but if it's about resources
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:53.840]  long as it's based around private property and the zeitgeist type idea you
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:58.480]  know isn't really along those lines I mean I think the guy's an excellent
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:01.640]  filmmaker he used a lot of my material obviously in his first big release that
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:05.800]  was the big hit and then I got criticized for his political ideas because my
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:10.000]  video was in it he didn't ask me he just used it later when he commercially
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.960]  released it I gave him permission because I I believe in people having a
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:16.480]  first amendment and I told him hell you ought to use it fair use pal you know
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:22.520]  this is political what I'm talking about you can critique what I'm saying but I'm
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:26.800]  for local control and I'm a constitutionalist that's the system
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:33.400]  under our republic that worked the best and I'm pretty wary of what the zeitgeist
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:36.880]  promotes I mean I think it's got some good ideas and a lot of good people that
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:44.040]  follow it stay with us third hour straight ahead you are listening to GCN

[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.680]  2011 Eddie Craig radio talk show host former sheriff's deputy who's won a lot
[02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:55.800]  of cases exposing the constitutional trampling that's going on by the police
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:59.720]  traffic court you name it this is a great way to fight back against the system

[02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:09.880]  be coming up in 20 minutes and I've got a lot of other news also going to be
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:15.240]  mentioning before we get there right now let's go back to your calls Matt in
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:18.960]  California and of course earlier the caller brought up zeitgeist that's fine
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:23.320]  does anybody concerned about this Penn State thing that for 18 years a major
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:27.280]  university could cover up basically a rape room with little kids that were
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:30.840]  being brought in as part of being disadvantaged I mean does that concern
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:36.760]  anybody I'm sure Matt might be calling in about something else but Matt why are
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:41.160]  you contacting us today well I was actually going to contact you about the
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:46.960]  Penn State case it seems that everyone who has a power elite or a feel of their
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.520]  elitism has some way to just kind of dissonate that cause the law amongst
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:55.880]  everything so they try to dehumanize everyone and we've seen it slowly
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:00.400]  happen but now I just think it's you know we're trying every front to remove
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:04.960]  the innocence that we can so now we're starting with the children that's right
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:10.480]  and that's why they're trying to teach five-year-olds sex both hetero and
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:14.640]  homosexual is to destroy their innocence and it's done in the name of
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:20.040]  diversity it's sick and wicked and it's done by a pervert government absolutely
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:23.960]  it's aggressive dominance you know you use it to destroy the hopes of the
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:28.040]  economics factor with people losing all of their money and now we have systems
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.840]  in place to destroy the innocence of children so that they don't even know
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.960]  how to fight back later on I mean they're been and they give them gartersill
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:38.320]  shots that hurt them it confirmed put them on drugs put fluoride the water
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:44.920]  this isn't this is this is just a wicked society yes I kind of repeat other
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:48.760]  pieces of history I mean this has been done for thousands and thousands of
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:53.600]  years only now it seems that our elite have taken on that the responsibility of
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:58.160]  doing it to us and it's a destructive method of course you know we need to
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:02.720]  stop this at hand because we need we need children to be able to be the
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.560]  future to be able to fight back against the next problem or in fact if we can
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:11.680]  create a solution to this problem have a future for our children so where they
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:14.800]  don't feel victimized so much that they can actually work towards a better
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:19.160]  society that's right and then they take the crimes they've committed and then
[02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:23.200]  advertise it everywhere and create government programs to fight what they've
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:27.560]  created and then they advertise the evil and put it in people's minds what
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.040]  there's a verse in the Bible about you know they ran around continually
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.920]  inventing new forms of wickedness I forget the exact the exact quote I've
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:40.200]  actually got my wallet around here somewhere that has got another Bible
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:43.120]  verse in it I wanted to read on air but go ahead and take us out to break you've
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:47.160]  got the floor hey you know I just think that you're doing a great thing you know
[02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:51.200]  you're you're a wonderful person but we need to we need to always pay attention
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:56.320]  we need to be focused on changing the world and and by allowing this to happen
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:00.040]  and then considering it oh it's just a you know a one-time consideration and
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:04.400]  these kids are confused it's not you know as well as I do it's happening more
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.440]  than we would like and for us to find a solution we need to be able to stop
[02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:13.440]  elite in every behavior that they have well look they need to take the guy
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:16.400]  when he's convicted there's all these witnesses to it and he needs to be hung
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:21.200]  and they need to take everyone who covered it up and execute them I mean
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:23.880]  you there they're a cop and that'll stop it real fast I mean when you're
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:29.440]  confirmed you did this and you covered it up that is that's Mussolini level and
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:33.160]  what ended up happening to Mussolini I mean that that'll put the fear of God to
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:37.720]  these people I mean that's the problem they always want to kill us it's time
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:42.520]  through the system they'd be brought to justice it's time these people start
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:46.440]  being executed and until that starts happening they're gonna continue doing
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:51.520]  what they're doing they need to die but first they need to be adjudicated by a
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:56.120]  jury of their peers we'll be right back stay with us

[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:26.960]  well happy valley Penn State one of the iconic universities that the good guys
[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:34.680]  old-fashioned meanwhile for 18 years they've known of the ongoing reports of
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:39.800]  children being raped inside the field how showers and other areas and now
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:44.120]  reports are coming out it's on the drugs report it's on info wars dot com we
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:48.480]  have a special report tonight with more the background of this around the
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:53.400]  country that reportedly they may have been bringing donors in that's what I
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:09:00.120]  said on Monday I said my gut from seeing these rings in the past Republican
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:05.760]  National Committee the Franklin cover-up the Texas Youth Commission this guy
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:09.720]  wouldn't do in this in plain view because he was crazy he was doing it
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:16.080]  because he was evil and he knew that he had the full backing of the sickos
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:22.560]  above him I'd give it about a 99% chance there's a bunch of pervs above him a
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:29.400]  bunch of walking maggots and of course the DA went by and by had never been
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:37.920]  found probably dead NBC reports in 2005 decided not to go with it 2002 didn't
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:41.200]  didn't investigate it but then disappeared or maybe got to pay off maybe
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.120]  maybe maybe just fell off a turnip truck somewhere and is sitting on the
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:50.600]  side of the road for 11 years or excuse me six seven years I want to continue
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:56.120]  and go back to your phone calls so this is very painful to see this but we just
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:02.600]  get numb to it like with the Catholic Church stuff and the things that have
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  gone on in the Boy Scouts Boy Scouts great organization but if I was to let
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:16.240]  my son in the Boy Scouts I've been so busy I haven't even had a minute I'd
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:22.040]  have to go to every event I'd have to be right there next to him in the tent and
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:25.200]  it screwed up as this society is because there's so many these perverts I'd have
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:28.440]  to stay with my son in our own tent I would not stay in a tent with other
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:34.040]  kids and this really destroys the family it destroys the image of fatherhood and
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.880]  men as leaders this is how the devil destroys society it's how these sick
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:43.840]  those do this because now people are afraid at public events to even when
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:48.240]  children talk to them to even say hi to them every man is a suspect because we've
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:56.600]  allowed these wicked devils to operate it's incredible Frank in North Carolina
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:01.400]  and then Clayton and others you're on the air Frank welcome yeah at a time of
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:06.080]  universal deceit speaking truth had become a revolutionary act info wars

[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:17.880]  station tomorrow morning and that's what I've been doing for months and months
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:22.160]  trying to get the word out I've been getting the word out week after week after
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:26.400]  week I'm only about the only one that calls in so I was calling basically just
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:31.640]  to put a request out anybody in my area there's really only one neocon station
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:35.920]  here it's really the only talk radio stations 50,000 watts it covers a wide
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:39.960]  area North Carolina even goes down into South Carolina during the evening it's
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:44.960]  actually from Maine to Cuba so it's a very oh yeah there are there are AM
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:49.200]  stations that on average over the day some of those 50,000 waters might have a
[02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:53.600]  million listeners and they can't even get calls because a mainline jellyfish
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:58.160]  head won't won't actually dial a phone we're in that big of a coma and patriots
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:01.640]  can call in don't lie to the screener tell me what about the issue they want

[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.960]  you can get through it's not that hard to get through most of the time and a lot
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:32.960]  of times it works out perfect because I'm the last caller right before Rush
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:37.560]  Limbaugh comes on and I do a little seven second ad for you I'll tell you I'll tell
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:40.760]  you my friend if our three million listeners that tune in every day reach
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:44.240]  about 15 million every week one way or another if they would all do things like
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.320]  that it bring the globalists to their knees if people would start their own
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:53.520]  website and plug that in people which go and broker get a few sponsors get their
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:57.920]  own time on a little station doesn't matter or go to an access show or air my
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:02.920]  films whatever the people are ready to be awakened and I found that either area
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:09.480]  are totally unawake and under a trance or they're really waking up but again I
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:15.240]  played football I like sports I like baseball I like it all I like track I
[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:21.360]  like field I like everything but I it's become a sick thing where that's all we
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:24.760]  look up to that's all we've got as a culture not a bill of rights not a
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:30.160]  Constitution not a private property and the system uses that to sell all their
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.000]  messages interwoven with the sports and it's become a gladiatorial bread and
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:41.480]  circus it's become very very sick and I just see men like zombies who aren't
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:45.920]  even men and all they do is kind of toadie around about their sports heroes
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:50.560]  and then now they don't know what to do they go our hero our hero covered up
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:57.080]  this well that's okay then you know oh big deal again it's I see so much
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.880]  sickness around sports now now I'm not talking about kids and soccer or football
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:06.320]  it's I'm all about people in sports but just these organized well let me take
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:09.760]  the universities now they admit they're a giant bubble most people will never be
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.200]  able to get a job good enough to pay off their degree I'm all for education but
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:19.000]  it's become a fraud to many you know respects and levels and now they want
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.040]  us to bail it all out those of us that you know got out of college or didn't
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.480]  finish college because we were already doing well in life or chose another
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:30.760]  career path and all these big universities have now is the facade of the
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:36.240]  sports team it's not about the academia it's not about the test scores it's not
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:40.320]  about the inventions it's not about that I mean take UT they've got close to a
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:43.720]  hundred billion dollars in their permanent fund and some other slush funds
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:47.320]  and they're always raising fees raising all the stuff they get all this tax
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:50.880]  money all this other revenue from their oil that they own biggest landowner in
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:56.160]  Texas and the more corrupt they get the bigger the football becomes because
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:00.360]  that's the facade you go there to wear a buy a t-shirt wear it feel like you're
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:05.680]  part of a tribe and you're getting a degree that's being devalued just like
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:11.320]  the US dollar that's why I'm so angry at sports because the more effeminate and
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:17.400]  toady but but fake tough you know macho you are the more you're into sports and
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:23.160]  I look at these men these are not men and it just totally freaks me out we
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.000]  don't have time to sit there and watch the football game you know you don't
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.640]  have time to know your bill of rights you don't have time to be informed you
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:32.480]  don't have time to know why you're losing your jobs but you got time to sit
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:38.000]  there and suck your thumb and watch a bunch of of arrogant professional
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.040]  football players or whatever run around the field I'm sorry it's sick I
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:45.640]  appreciate your call and look when football baseball is a pastime or
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:50.520]  whatever as some side thing when you know your work's done and America wasn't
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:56.880]  in this position sure but now you go to the football game they grope you the
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:01.200]  all of this they bombard you with all these messages I mean folks stop being
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:08.040]  used stop being sucked into this this this thing America is rotten okay
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:12.360]  America needs to repent it's because I love this country I'm telling you we've
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:16.360]  got cancer it's like if you have the flu and you've got to vomit out the
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.840]  viruses the vomiting is your body getting the poison out that getting a
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:24.160]  fever they always say give babies fever when they or I mean give babies
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:27.600]  Tylenol they have a fever even though it's a hundred if the fever is what
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:33.520]  kills the infection we need to have a fever we need to throw up that's
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.040]  repenting we need to get the poison out but to get the poison out we've got to
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:45.000]  admit what the poison is and I'm not perfect okay I'm worldly I mean both
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.240]  people think I am pretty moral I mean I like to drink sometimes I shouldn't very
[02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:52.200]  faithful my wife and really lover and she's beautiful but I still catch myself
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:56.760]  lusting I mean I'll be honest I mean I'm a man and I repent for that because I
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:00.880]  need to be strong and focused to defend my family and I need to be dedicated my
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:05.280]  energy a hundred percent towards doing goodness because it's not a joke you're
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:09.000]  in a struggle with evil and if you don't stay on top evil it's going to
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.320]  overtake you okay societally economically spiritually it is an
[02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:21.000]  ongoing struggle Clayton in Ohio you're on the air yeah it's yeah I wanted to
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:24.680]  bring up some issues or a cup the first thing I wanted to bring up was a
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:29.720]  question and the first question I have is this what do you think will be the
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:35.880]  21st century version of the Stamp Act? Oh it's gonna be his Christmas tree stamp
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.960]  act yesterday but they'd killed that it's probably going to be taking people's
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:45.320]  houses that the government and then the and the banks don't own it can be the
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:49.840]  TSA in fact now that I think the TSA is probably gonna be the 21st century
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:53.360]  Stamp Act especially when they start highway checkpoints and the first
[02:18:53.360 --> 02:18:57.440]  person blows up and you know when they grope their kid and shoots a bunch of
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.320]  people and then they call them terrorists and then other people just say
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:05.320]  I'm fed up and start doing it it's gonna turn into a civil war like 1776 and
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:09.720]  then it's on the Stamp Act will be them coming for the guns I can't tell you how
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:13.480]  many veterans and people aren't afraid to die don't even like life too much
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:17.040]  anymore and are looking for it and that the government in a way is right that
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:20.280]  they know the tyranny they're going to bring in is gonna cause a lot of
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:23.240]  patriots to start fighting them and they're gonna be called terrorists so
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:27.840]  it's true the number one threat to the New World Order is the veterans not to
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:30.840]  the US government but to the criminals that took it over so in their internal
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:35.000]  manuals when they're trying to take on veterans they better because let me tell
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.960]  you something these people are ready they're not scared they're just holding
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:43.000]  back they're hoping things to be turned around and I would not want to be a New
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.440]  World Order minion we're gonna get to cause a little bit with Eddie Craig you
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:51.480]  want to hold till later or are you done sir no I want to hold cuz that cuz

[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:06.600]  Lewis here once again these are hard times for investors if you're like me
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:09.960]  you just don't know where to put your money because there's a downside to
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:15.000]  every possible scenario now look every portfolio needs a hedge for inflation
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.200]  gold has been the classic I want to tell you want to be honest with you
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:22.880]  commodities fluctuate so you could lose money gold goes up and down but every
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:28.040]  stable portfolio usually has an inflation hedge and gold is well the gold
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:31.600]  standard Washington is not going to get us out of this recovery so you've got
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:34.640]  to protect yourself give it some thought and if you're interested in
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:38.240]  converting your IRA to gold or would like to actually have it in your
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:45.480]  possession call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237 the US dollar was
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:50.280]  once backed by gold but it's lost a lot of its value since then call Midas
[02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:59.120]  Resources today 1-800-686-2237 for gold that's 1-800-686-2237 and tell them

[02:21:18.600 --> 02:21:23.440]  headlights of an oncoming car waiting for others for help one out of 10 will
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:28.520]  actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down and only one
[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:32.840]  out of 10 will take swift and decisive action when the going gets tough
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:37.200]  dramatically increasing their chances of survival folks I've just read a new

[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:34.440]  to some of your calls towards the end so we at least get to the folks that are
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:37.200]  holding maybe do a little bit of overdrive it'll be back with us tonight
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:41.240]  of the nightly news but I know a little bit about the law I've studied it some
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:45.440]  you know more than most but most people have no knowledge so they're lambs to the
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:50.960]  slaughter but listening to his radio show that's on here locally and seeing
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:54.120]  the success he's had in court and the news articles that have been written
[02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:58.840]  about it across the state I wanted to get him in studio as a former sheriff's
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:03.160]  tepid to you basically break down what he learned and just how much the
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:07.440]  Constitution's being trampled but I was going to ask you what would you do if
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.040]  you were Jesse Ventura they create a law saying you don't get a jury trial that
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:14.640]  goes right to appellate court they don't really tell him that they let it sit
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:18.760]  there until the appeal time is over they're claiming and I said what would
[02:25:18.760 --> 02:25:22.400]  you do you sort of rid a mandamus and that's what I would probably and I've
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:25.840]  told Ventura that he's like well I'll talk to my lawyer but explain to people
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:29.880]  what a red a man damas is and just in that case point example what you would
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:34.640]  do about that well a red a man damas basically is a writ to a higher court
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:39.240]  requesting that it enforce its power to overrule a lower court determination
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:43.640]  regarding its decision basically there are rules and procedures the courts have
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:48.240]  to comply with and when they don't then you appeal to a higher court to direct
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:52.600]  the lower court to follow the rules and this is a good indication in this case
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:57.640]  where the rules are definitely not being followed the state Constitution in any
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.200]  state according to its own language is the highest law of authority in that
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:07.080]  state so the legislature can't just arbitrarily enact a statute nor can the
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:12.360]  court arbitrarily interpret a statute that would violate the Constitution of
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:15.800]  the state and you've been engaging a lot of pro se research for a long time I
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.400]  want to when we come back in the next long segment break down who you are and
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:22.840]  how you woke up but just from a layman's position the FBI can't stick their
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:27.320]  hands down your pants in a warrantless situation and their special
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:31.360]  pursuers even then if you're in custody or you as a sheriff's deputy couldn't
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:35.720]  but now they have federal goons out of their jurisdiction not even sworn
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:40.600]  taking over and now they're going to be and are on the highways how and why is
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:45.120]  that unconstitutional both federal and state from your research well just
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:48.760]  straight up it on the federal Constitution side since it governs the
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:53.280]  actions of the TSA they are acting as a federal agency then the specific
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:56.640]  limitations of the Constitution there would apply in the bill of rights no
[02:26:56.640 --> 02:27:01.960]  illegal search and seizures so on and so forth your fourth fifth and six
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:06.880]  amendment rights are not up for grabs just because Congress wants to pass a
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:12.320]  no substantiated bill creating a particular agency or allowing some
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:16.960]  already authorized agency to create a separate department and then create its
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.920]  own rules for it's rules and regulations still must abide by the laws and by the
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:26.440]  Constitution when it fails to do that then it needs to be challenged and the
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:29.400]  only way we can do that right now is to take these people to court
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:33.040]  unfortunately and I was told by TSA agent Las Vegas that he had a
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:38.560]  administrative right to stick his hand down my pants no not true not true they
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:43.040]  only get away with what they're doing for two reasons we acquiesce and they're
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:46.840]  holding the guns that's really the only reason we've entered a realm of tyranny
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:50.920]  I mean this is on its face and of course you could go over how many rulings are
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:55.440]  there where Marbury versus Madison they go on and on just because government
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:59.160]  passes some law if it's not in the Bill of Rights Constitution I mean if it's
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:03.560]  clearly unconstitutional then it's still illegal they could pass a lawsuit and
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:06.560]  black people aren't human again does that mean blacks have to follow that law
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:11.000]  no it doesn't and there are many many rulings through the history of the
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.160]  United States from the higher court stating that the people do not have to
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:19.720]  accept arbitrary rule or actions by their government servants they don't and
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:23.920]  right now what we have in the biggest part of this problem is that the servant
[02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:27.720]  now believes themselves to be the master and we're letting them keep that
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:33.240]  train of thought alive and well by not returning to our true role and getting
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.760]  rid of these people that would institute this tell us about your time as a sheriff
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:42.240]  step in how you woke up well for the most part the individual I was working
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:47.640]  for who was sheriff and acadoches at the time had a very sullied reputation for
[02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:52.320]  the way he ran things in the way he did things my town happens to sit on one of
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:56.000]  the largest drug highways through the state highway 59 and 259 where they
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.200]  centered together there in acadoches and there was constantly drug bust there and
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:05.320]  so on and so forth but for some reason the amount of bus we had never seemed to
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:10.280]  amount equal to what we contained in the evidence rooms and things of that
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:14.640]  nature so it was obvious that a lot of what was being seized was not being
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:19.280]  kept for the purpose of evidence nor was it actually being destroyed so where
[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:24.160]  was it going you could see things like that you could see stay there let's come
[02:29:24.160 --> 02:29:28.040]  back in the long segment break down your awakening process similar to mine I
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:32.600]  saw the police dealing drugs sheriff's deputies and police where I grew up and
[02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:35.920]  I'm like you guys are drug dealers and then I'd see them a week later at the
[02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:38.740]  school lecturing us about don't use drugs they were really they're
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:42.280]  advertising here's the product Eddie Craig's our guest for a really great

[02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:29.680]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four

[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:25.640]  alive with Eddie Craig and you were getting to the point of you started to
[02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:29.160]  notice what you believe was corruption in the Sheriff's Department with missing
[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:34.560]  drugs please continue and then we'll get into somebody who studied the law one
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:38.960]  in court how we see our bill of rights our Constitution being destroyed what
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:44.200]  you would do and then they now say it's going into all 50 states you pull up army
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:47.880]  could be there TSA is always in command viper teams and they're and they're
[02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:52.160]  directing families out jerking them out of cars searching them barking orders
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:57.280]  basically like people showing up at a supermax prison I mean they want to let
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:01.200]  you know you're lower than dirt and the feds are here and they're taking over
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:04.480]  under civil emergency this is really martial law is how they're doing it but
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:08.640]  continue with your awakening and then just run the gamut of things people need
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:13.440]  to be made aware of well as far as the rest of my awakening was concerned when
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:18.280]  I've watched all these officers through my career there and everything writing
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.360]  all these traffic citations and I couldn't figure out exactly what the
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:26.040]  offense was other than just what they call a malaprohibidome action or they
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:30.360]  just want to simply say that it's illegal because we said it is not because
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:35.080]  anybody got hurt or it caused any damage it's just illegal because we declared
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:39.240]  it to be illegal it's very much like the war on drugs it's just one of the
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:44.320]  things they want to do to get further control of us right now in these state
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.400]  programs like the driver's license and registration so on and so forth it's all
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:54.240]  about the control of your ability to move they want to know where you are when
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:59.320]  you are everything about you is monitored because of these licenses and
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:04.080]  registrations the smart tags they use on the toll roads for instance those are
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:06.720]  going to be coming into the license place those are becoming into the
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:09.760]  inspector they admit they're already tracking everybody in lifetime you've
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:13.120]  got to get all permission to get a hunting license they run your background
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:16.880]  oh hadn't paid child support didn't pay your taxes and soon they admit under
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:20.200]  Homeland Security you haven't paid your taxes which is the fellow reserve you
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:23.960]  won't be able to have a job right and that's the entire reason why the state
[02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:26.840]  started implementing the use of the social security number and any kind of
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:31.880]  licensing is they used it under the guise of protecting people from unpaid
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:35.800]  child support you can't exercise this privilege unless you're current with
[02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:40.320]  your child support again just another way of getting into the family they're
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:44.240]  turning the whole country into a giant prison and to be able to work it's like
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:47.800]  you're a trustee allowed out at Huntsville to go sweep the side of the
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.800]  street yeah pretty much and you got all these licenses and fees and face scanning
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:55.440]  and light pole microphones that's the equivalent of the chains on his legs
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:36:00.360]  exactly and what we the people have failed to understand is is that when we
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:04.360]  created the government we created them for one specific purpose to protect our
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:09.440]  individual rights and our individual property from incursion by outside
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:14.400]  forces now that's flipped backwards exactly now they are the outside force
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:18.200]  that's seeking to take control of everything that we have so roll through
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:23.320]  examples traffic stops you name it break it down okay for instance they pull you
[02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:26.880]  over they issue a citation what most people to understand about the traffic
[02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:31.640]  laws is the commercial nature of those laws the licensing the registration the
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:35.600]  insurance all of those things only apply to people that are engaging in
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:40.200]  transportation that's the whole gist right there and transportation by
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:46.120]  definition is the movement of goods or services by carrier whether that carrier
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:51.440]  is a public carrier or private contract carrier all of those are entities that
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:56.400]  make their living using the roads as a place of business and commerce you and
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:00.200]  I don't do that we've been duped into believing we have to have and by the way
[02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:03.200]  I've told police officers this and they laugh at me even though it's one of the
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:07.480]  most adjudicated issues since the 20s I know you could rattle off the cases all
[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:10.640]  day there they're now saying our guns are a privilege
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:15.960]  driving is not a privilege or traveling is not a privilege owning a gun's not a
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:20.120]  privilege but they're telling us it is that's true and again to me the
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:24.080]  adjudication of the issues is not so much the right to travel as it is the
[02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:28.160]  deprivation of the right of liberty and locomotion which is what the higher
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:32.320]  courts including the Supreme Court have adjudicated for decades about the
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:37.240]  people's individual right of liberty locomotion is a necessary attachment to
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:42.000]  the right of liberty and they've ruled time and time again that the people have
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:46.720]  we own the roads not the state the state is the caretaker we appointed to
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:51.440]  manage and maintain those roads and it's an archetypal image of authoritarian
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:56.240]  systems people on reservations plantations Roman slave grids to have
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:01.680]  checkpoints and the roads turning into militarized systems that is what it is
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:05.560]  to live in an occupied country when you have them we've shown you military
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:10.240]  training films where they admit secretly this is all this is martial law
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:14.840]  this is what it's like to live in a third-world country that's true and the
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:17.240]  biggest way they're getting away with the things like the roadblocks and the
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:19.840]  things like you're talking about is right now everyone is under the
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:24.120]  impression this applies to me and because they're acquiescing to that
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:28.040]  they're making themselves subject to it pretty much everything in the
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:33.400]  transportation code is done by agreement I agree to be bound by these rules as
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:38.040]  long as I'm acting in this privileged state and as it's done millions of times
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:43.000]  it creates a common law precedent it's still fraudulent but but when I've
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:50.040]  researched in law possessions nine-tenths they are by just way of just
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:54.680]  oh what's the term that they use in some of the more ancient common law that it's
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:38:58.720]  accustomed and so they're accustomed they're getting the cops accustomed
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.560]  they're getting you accustomed right they basically have acclimated us to be
[02:39:03.560 --> 02:39:07.760]  apathetic in our the exercise of our rights your rights are what the state
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:11.640]  dictates your rights are that's what our kids are being trained in school to
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:15.920]  accept that's what the adults are being trained to accept for those that are
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:20.040]  actually in law enforcement believe it or not there are many of them that don't
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:23.720]  understand the nuances of what's going on but they know they don't like it well
[02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:26.840]  take let's talk about that but take vaccines they've known there's no law
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:31.960]  you have to take vaccines they lie on the news in concert across the country the
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:35.280]  same talking point to say it's the law you'll be arrested but really the school
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:40.500]  triggers truancy kicks you out and then uses the truancy to try to arrest you
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:44.640]  when they were lying and kicking you out for something that wasn't a law they're
[02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:48.360]  now engaged in racketeering and fraud that's true that's true they're
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:51.920]  actually misrepresenting the law and believe it or not Texas has a law
[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:56.360]  against that if you misrepresent the existence of a law for the purpose of
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:00.520]  creating or inducing an action by another that's illegal in this state
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:06.040]  it's completely illegal and no one knows that and no one will take that penal
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:09.840]  statute and go after the public servant that's using it illegally in that
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:14.080]  manner for instance one of the biggest things the police use here in Texas to
[02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:18.440]  illegally arrest people is either public intoxication statute or failure to
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:24.080]  identify now 38.02 penal code here in Texas on the failure to identify is very
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.600]  very specific in order to be charged with failure to identify the individual
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:34.600]  must have already been lawfully arrested for some other crime and emphasis on
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:40.160]  lawfully arrested here they try to take it a jail if you won't produce a
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:43.640]  driver's license registration and proof of insurance during a traffic stop they
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:48.680]  say that you fail to identify but the statute does not require a physical
[02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:53.960]  presentation of a physical identity card of any kind it simply requires you
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:58.920]  provide three pieces of information name address and date of birth and nothing
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:05.560]  more now given that when you are being told you have to provide a physical by
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:10.160]  the way that's international common law name rank and serial number pretty much
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:15.000]  yeah military status of everything but again if I have not been lawfully
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.320]  arrested for something I'm not even and cannot be required to provide you even
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:24.120]  with that information so if you're attempting to take a transportation
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:28.760]  statute and use it against me as a private citizen I have not been lawfully
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:33.920]  arrested and in Texas go back to some of the the federal rulings when I could
[02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:36.920]  pull them up on transportation but I know you'll probably know them from memory
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:40.040]  it goes back to saying well the trucks are turning up our roads we'll charge
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:44.840]  them a special tax because the general public paid for these roads because
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:47.960]  they're engaged in commerce and that that's all they're talking about yeah
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:54.760]  Chicago motor coach versus the state of Illinois you've got let's see we have one
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.480]  out of San Antonio here in Texas that is very clear I can't remember the site for
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:03.720]  it but it says very clearly that all of the roads in the state belong to the
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:08.800]  people and we have every right to use them with the common conveyances of the
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:12.440]  day including an automobile well that's why they're trying to tell farmers now
[02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:15.640]  they can't drive down the side of the road with federal regulations because
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:22.360]  they want to abridge that common right of people using the shoulders well
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:27.320]  that's the Chisholm Trail I-35 out there what was made by people driving cattle
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:32.520]  humans have a right especially in agriculture to move down the road that's
[02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:37.360]  true but again this federal incursion into the states is our fault it's our
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:42.400]  fault because we're not resisting it we're not resisting it by going after
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.040]  our representatives that are allowing and giving permission for the federal
[02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:50.040]  government to do these things the people that say they're there to represent us
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:55.880]  are not representing us it's just that simple can we fix this politically
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:01.200]  doubtful why because all the politics is bought and paid for already but some of
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:04.600]  it we are reversing take Perry with the NAFTA highways that got exposed and
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:08.880]  stopped most of it his guard of silly said it's the law you will take it and
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:12.200]  people legislature called him I mean some of this stuff they're getting so
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:17.280]  bold that it's gonna bring them down that's true but again as the general
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:21.480]  public we have to be knowledgeable about what these people are doing we need to
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:25.320]  be as knowledgeable about the laws of our state as they are so when they
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:29.440]  violate them we know exactly where to go after okay okay we're driving down the
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:31.640]  road again I'm gonna have you back in the near future on the show tonight we
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:34.800]  could talk for 10 hours but but there's so much to talk about but let's say I'm
[02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:39.080]  driving down the road or or or you're driving on the road and you're going six
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:44.520]  miles over the speed limit and I turn my lights on you pull over on the right
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:49.240]  hand side and I come over and I say license and registration please not
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:54.160]  they ever really say please anymore and then you where do you go from there and
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:59.760]  then two minutes later I say mind of eyes search your vehicle okay in my
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:03.840]  class that I teach down at brave new books I have three set questions we ask
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:08.200]  and three set actions that follow first question is is what is the emergency and
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:12.200]  how can I help we're not going to presume under any circumstances we've done
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:16.240]  anything wrong because we're not in transportation so the laws they're using
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:20.320]  to pull us over for speeding or anything else don't apply second question is is
[02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:25.480]  am I under arrest third question is am I free to go you cannot get the same
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:30.520]  answer to question two and three if you do something's wrong we ask those
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:35.240]  questions to specifically make the record known that we are in a custodial
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:39.840]  arrest and we know it this automatically invokes our right to remain silent not
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:44.480]  to testify against ourselves so on and so forth the courts have adjudicated that
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:49.800]  aspect very clearly very few people realize that Texas law specifically
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:53.800]  creates the instance of a custodial arrest the moment an officer pulls you
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:59.160]  over for the express purpose of issuing a citation chapter 543 transportation
[02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:03.560]  code dictates very clearly that the arresting officer can only release the
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:08.640]  person arrested from custody if the person will sign the promise to appear on
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:12.720]  the citation otherwise the officer is required by law to take the person
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:17.880]  immediately before a magistrate they never do these things they'll threaten
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:22.720]  you and this is the law this is the law it is when they're they're so busy always
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:26.520]  throwing the book at us for nothing they're just violating it up one side and
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:30.040]  down the other correct and that's very rarely why in these wins in court you
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:34.920]  were talking about that I ever have to go to merits of the case why I will never
[02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:38.840]  address the merits of a case that have outstanding due process violations and
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:43.520]  at a minimum the moment a police officer pulls you over on the side of the road he
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:48.680]  will commit a minimum a minimum of five due process violations before that stop
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:53.480]  ends but that's just like I'm now putting GPS on tens of thousands people's cars
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:57.480]  with no warrant and they the courts are saying yeah we can do that now or the
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.960]  iPhones the government dialing in the listing without warrants they just do it
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:06.280]  or now trying to put tags on the license plates I mean this is 1984 and just ten
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:10.000]  years ago everybody's like oh that'll never happen now that it's happening you
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.200]  said a lot of police you talked to and same with me the lot of them are good
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  people and and they know stuff's wrong they don't have all the nuances they
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:20.320]  know more than the public but they haven't really studied it and I mean I
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:24.680]  challenge them to study just basic history this is a bona fide illegal
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:28.640]  garbage every time the government spies on you without a warrant it's a felony
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:33.360]  state and federal I can pull it up for people I mean this is a big deal you're
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:37.440]  gonna commit all these felonies cops ass they want to search my car and I'm
[02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:42.240]  like number one you know you're not an idiot don't look like I use your
[02:46:42.240 --> 02:46:44.560]  illegal products these are getting mad and I say what the government's been
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:49.880]  caught over and over again dealing drugs you know you make me sick I mean what
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:53.200]  do you say to them when they want to search your car well if they're gonna
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:56.800]  search my car they're going to break into it on a traffic stop the very first
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:01.320]  thing I do is pull into a private parking lot not the side of the road I go
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:06.000]  onto some piece of private property I immediately get out of my car lock the
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:10.240]  doors and throw the keys into the front seat I keep a spare door key in my wallet
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:14.480]  which he doesn't have to know but the only reason they can search your car on
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:18.560]  a traffic stop is if you are in it and the courts have ruled over and over again
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:23.120]  they can do that as a general search of the passenger and driver compartment
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:26.640]  area to ensure that you don't have access to a weapon that could harm the
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:29.960]  officer by getting out of the car locking the door and putting the keys
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:34.480]  inside you remove any possibility whatsoever of having an access to the
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:39.000]  weapon inside that car if there even is one therefore you remove any viable
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:42.200]  explanation the officer could have for conducting a search without a warrant
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:45.960]  that's my practice and policy and it's what I've done every time I've been
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:51.480]  pulled over and so far they will not get a warrant they cannot hold you to call a
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:55.600]  drug dog in unless they show up during the period of time when they're actually
[02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:59.360]  working on issuing the citation then they can take the time to run the dog
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:04.000]  around the car having worked in law enforcement I know when they key the dog
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:08.160]  to make him react I was about I've talked to cops who admit that that flash will
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:13.080]  always do it for a biscuit oh yeah I mean it's yeah the things they do in order
[02:48:13.080 --> 02:48:17.200]  to find some reason to terrorize the public a lot of these officers is
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:20.600]  astounding it really really is all he actually asked once when I was on the
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.680]  radio in about 45 minutes I was only halfway there and they pulled me over on
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:30.320]  one a three back when I was 15 years ago up there and they wanted to search my
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:35.320]  Tahoe and I said no I don't authorize he said well I'm gonna get a dog and I
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:40.200]  looked at my watch and I said if you okay go ahead but I'm doing this under
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.960]  duress because I got to get to work and I said I don't use your products and he
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:47.520]  kind of as soon as I let him he just left and I understand as soon as I said
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:50.600]  he could he didn't want to search it then and I know cops are actually fighting
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:54.440]  real criminals all day so they get this idea of well we'll just violate
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:58.080]  things because we're doing good but that's how they build these tyrannies
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:02.840]  that's how you know it's this excuse of we're gonna get at the job I saw somebody
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:07.640]  comment on my website about warrantless checkpoints and they said we're it was
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:11.240]  obviously a cop we're fighting crime and nothing will stop us from getting to the
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:15.040]  bad guys and it's nothing like those mindless Dudley do rights who's
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:19.280]  supervisors probably dealing cocaine and they don't even know it I mean these
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:23.120]  guys are just I mean in your experience aren't from I've seen some of the best
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:27.880]  well-meaning people goody-to-shoe types are some of the dumbest and most dangerous
[02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:31.280]  because they just absolutely believe they're in the right that that's very
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:36.160]  true it's very true the it's all about education and it's all about the
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:41.600]  education they didn't get a lot of these people are chosen because they've been
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:46.560]  immunized against violations of people's rights they've been immunized against
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:50.760]  violence and so on and so forth so they have a particular mindset about them
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:55.840]  that allows them to excel in these particular positions there are many of
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:00.480]  these people that are there for the ego trip the power that it gives them so and
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:04.560]  so forth and then there are those that are genuinely there for the purpose of
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:08.840]  serving and protecting the public the day I met you down at the Capitol I was
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.560]  actually in the process of talking to numerous DPS officers down there about
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:16.720]  the traffic statutes themselves and one of the things in the traffic seminar
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:21.280]  that we sell on rule of law radio is that the book is written entirely about
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:26.600]  how to read understand and research statutory law we use the Texas traffic
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:31.080]  statutes expressly for that purpose and I was explaining to them about what the
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:36.480]  mission of the DPS is in Texas the DPS's mission is strictly to supervise
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:41.520]  traffic on rural highways and to supervise and regulate emphasis on
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:46.360]  regulate meaning license registration insurance and all this commercial and
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:51.400]  for higher traffic now that's not you and me and that by the way that's the law
[02:50:51.400 --> 02:50:54.880]  I've read it yeah you tell police this are like no I'm like would you please
[02:50:54.880 --> 02:50:58.480]  read your own penal code we'll be right back we'll do an extra segment of

[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:47.400]  we're actually starting a new venture where we are going to be directly
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:52.440]  assisting people with private investigations for a small fee into
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:55.640]  their traffic citation so that they can get a certified notice to take the
[02:56:55.640 --> 02:56:59.640]  court that the traffic citation was issued fraudulently and in error good
[02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:02.440]  and we're almost out of time for the official show what was it you were
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:05.400]  talking about before we went to break and I said you'd finish the DPS officers
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:09.760]  down you know I was like yelling at them and stuff and very angry because you
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:12.960]  know get the courage up to go storm the Capitol and a lot of them afterwards
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:16.080]  were like no no we agree with you I guess they don't like their wives being
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:19.800]  groped either that's true and these officers were actually very receptive
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:23.000]  to the information that I tell them about the traffic statutes and so on and
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.400]  so forth a lot of them have received generic training on the issues but
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:32.480]  nothing specific and they'll admit to that and just so you know officers out
[02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:37.120]  there and attorneys my seminar book and materials absolutely free to police
[02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:42.000]  officers of any kind and to attorneys why because I'd rather you actually knew
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:45.680]  the law you're working under for the benefit of the people rather than the
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:50.400]  revenue at officers you've become well that's what's amazing a lot of the time
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:53.200]  there they think they're following a law that doesn't exist and they're actually
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:57.800]  breaking laws that's true there they're actually violating many more laws than
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:03.120]  they're actually preventing the alleged violator from committing one traffic
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:08.560]  stop citation for speeding versus five due process violations in that stop alone
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:12.240]  how many different laws did the officer break yeah two wrongs don't make a
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:19.680]  right exactly or five wrongs don't make a right a very well put amazing we're

[03:01:06.200 --> 03:01:11.320]  so yeah I want to bring that I want to bring that up and then and also and then
[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:16.320]  also what I wanted to bring up as well is that how you talk about child
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:22.600]  protective services breaking up families I actually witnessed that growing up so
[03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:27.160]  I know exactly how that goes and again they're the investigators so the smart
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:30.880]  pedophiles go and get that job and then it's almost impossible for him to get
[03:01:30.880 --> 03:01:35.560]  caught and it's it's come out over and over again though it is just a nest of
[03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:39.560]  perverts unbelievable scum even if they were good people who would want to be
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:42.680]  breaking up families and all that and see that every day I'd be hard to handle
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:47.440]  I mean something's wrong TSA people something's wrong with you if you'll
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:54.640]  grope people all day long I mean I mean oh man I tell you I mean if I was in a
[03:01:54.640 --> 03:01:58.000]  supermax prison I would want to grope killers this is not a job I want
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:01.680]  something's wrong with those people something's wrong with them I appreciate
[03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:06.160]  your call Kevin in Florida you're on the air Eddie jumping anytime you want go
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:10.840]  ahead Kevin you're on the air hey Alex listen I've got some insight for you
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:14.280]  that you're probably not gonna hear for some other people I want to speak to the
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:21.680]  sexual abuse yeah the Penn State fiasco you know I was a a child of very
[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:27.360]  severe sexual abuse at the hands of an older man I was sexually abused on
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:31.720]  numerous occasions but in this particular instance it was when I attended a
[03:02:31.720 --> 03:02:36.640]  private military academy and the point that I want to make here's two points
[03:02:36.640 --> 03:02:44.920]  one is the fact that what has to be done is you cannot put male authority figures
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:52.480]  particularly men that are in prominent positions in charge of little boys
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:59.200]  because it almost seems inevitable whether that seed was already in the
[03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:04.480]  malice or whether that seed grows as a result of being surrounded by nothing
[03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:12.280]  but little boy flesh eventually the monster comes out now in my case it was
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:16.240]  I was at a military academy there was there was an upper school in a junior
[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:23.720]  school I was in the junior school there was one man responsible for 30 to 40
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:30.240]  military cadets all boys and we're in we're grades 5th through 8th grade this
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:38.800]  one man was responsible every single year from any for 20 to 50 kids and his
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:45.120]  little junior school and no one ever overlooked you know him or what he was
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.600]  doing and in my case there were instances where there were other faculty
[03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:55.760]  members there were any windows there were rumors that would go around saying
[03:03:55.760 --> 03:04:00.480]  you know we're not sure about whatever happened to just Texas justice because I
[03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:05.240]  mean I was a mean mean per I mean vicious it like 13 years old and I mean
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:08.240]  I'm not I'm not sounds like I'm bragging but I'm not I'm actually
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:11.280]  ashamed of it but I mean if somebody did something like that next first time they
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:15.520]  turned around it ball team hammer I mean I'm sorry I mean I think they gets back
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:19.680]  to we've become domesticated people used to be real polite especially in the
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:23.920]  south because it's my wrong that their families gonna kill you and I'm not
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:27.280]  calling for any of that but I think this is all gotten out of control because
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:30.720]  people I mean a long time ago if you cheated somebody in business they were
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:33.960]  gonna kill you so people didn't cheat in bed any got any comments on that yeah
[03:04:33.960 --> 03:04:38.640]  we're being bred to the point of not to challenge any type of authority figure
[03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:43.720]  of any kind for any reason and I agree it's bad well sir calm call me back
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:49.960]  sometime I want to hear more about this it's just it's so alien for me I mean I
[03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:54.960]  just don't under these people are in positions of power we'll see you back
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:05:22.360]  tomorrow 11 a.m. and tonight 7 o'clock prisonplanet.tv God bless you all
