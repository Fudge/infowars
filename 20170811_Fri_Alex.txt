[00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:05.632]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:10.762]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:33.374 --> 00:00:42.197]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing 21st century warfare in America.
[00:00:42.197 --> 00:01:02.243]  We are witnessing a consortium of multinational corporations, foreign banks, you name it, working in concert against the American people, against our economy, and against our president.
[00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:14.124]  And if the people fully knew how bad it was, there would be a revolution in this country tomorrow, a violent one.
[00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:17.187]  I don't want that.
[00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:23.372]  And the media continues to misrepresent and says that I want violence.
[00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:30.898]  But they don't have any examples of it that they can point to that aren't edited out of context.
[00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:31.899]  Now, here is just
[00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:41.972]  Last week, on the 4th of August, Deep State's going to kill the President, Alex Jones claims.
[00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:57.725]  Then it literally says stuff like, gay frog, and random weird stuff, and has weird edited things I didn't say, to make it sound like I'm insane, when I really laid out the specifics of how they're preparing it, how they're promoting it, and how they're getting it ready.
[00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:07.681]  We had the former director of the CIA say that there should be a coup to remove the president two weeks ago.
[00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:11.023]  Now every morning I get up at 6 a.m.
[00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:11.343]  7 a.m.
[00:02:11.343 --> 00:02:23.130]  and I go to Infowars.com and almost every morning there is a new high-level Democrat from the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, you name it.
[00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.774]  People that are all on record illegally spying on us, doing illegal torture, I mean you name it.
[00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:38.118]  Ladies and gentlemen, I spent an hour this morning looking into this individual who I'd read about before.
[00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:38.998]  I'd seen his name.
[00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:43.642]  I went, because he just said, CNN analyst, we're preparing to kill Trump.
[00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:49.025]  She says Trump will be killed by the government, by the deep state, which also doesn't exist.
[00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:50.926]  The deep state is going to kill Trump.
[00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:53.148]  But when Alex Jones says it, he has such credibility.
[00:02:53.148 --> 00:02:54.849]  I said it first.
[00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.370]  Oh, deep state doesn't exist.
[00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.291]  And Jones is insane.
[00:02:59.338 --> 00:03:00.399]  These are the tactics.
[00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:05.424]  But see, when they say it to legitimize it, it's okay.
[00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:07.226]  So we're going to play that clip.
[00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:11.149]  This is Philip Mudd.
[00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:15.654]  And this guy is horrible.
[00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:20.999]  He is a creature of the Clintons, entire Clinton pedigree, a Mueller appointee,
[00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:29.132]  Out of nowhere, sycophantic, you name it, to direct the CIA takeover of the FBI.
[00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:31.897]  That's the office he runs.
[00:03:31.897 --> 00:03:32.638]  On TV!
[00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.682]  Implying that when Trump jokes that, oh, they kicked people out of our embassies, well, we've got some cost cuts there.
[00:03:40.682 --> 00:03:42.644]  You know, making fun of Putin.
[00:03:42.644 --> 00:03:43.344]  That's what Trump does.
[00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:45.466]  They go, oh, you want our CIA fired.
[00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:48.808]  You are, you know, kicked out of the embassies and all this stuff.
[00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:51.590]  And he's like, well, that's, they're going to, we're going to kill Trump.
[00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.411]  And the host is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:54.692]  You didn't mean that.
[00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:55.893]  He's like, yeah, we're going to kill him.
[00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.474]  So when we come back from break, we're going to play that clip for you, but it gets better.
[00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:12.204]  Mr. Mudd also says that when he's done with that, he's going to go over and they're going to arrest Congressman Gowdy, and they're going to chain him up to a wall and kick his teeth out.
[00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:12.824]  Yeah!
[00:04:12.824 --> 00:04:19.650]  Because that's what... Philip doesn't ever do the tooth-pulling himself, or the torture, or putting people in coffin boxes, or skinning people alive.
[00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.451]  Mr. Mudd
[00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:24.098]  He directed all of that!
[00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:24.840]  Yes!
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.790]  Yes, he's the one on the illegal torture dossiers and all the rest of it.
[00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.232]  Wow!
[00:04:30.723 --> 00:04:40.270]  And man, he's in another clip on CNN saying, I'm going to go over there and I'm going to kick Gowdy's ass.
[00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.931]  Wow.
[00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:42.932]  Yeah, I bet, buddy.
[00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:45.233]  I'd like to see you in a ring with Gowdy.
[00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:49.096]  Take one look at Gowdy's eyes and tell he'd unscrew your little anti-American head.
[00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:50.277]  But here's the deal.
[00:04:50.277 --> 00:04:52.358]  Media will spin that and say, I call for violence.
[00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:55.901]  He's the one saying, we're getting ready to kill the president.
[00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:57.402]  That's a piece of arrogance.
[00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:01.049]  Why is the fungus?
[00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:02.130]  Why is the mold?
[00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.871]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:04.832]  What is going on?
[00:05:04.832 --> 00:05:05.592]  What has changed?
[00:05:29.888 --> 00:05:31.329]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:33.309]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:34.769]  For me, it's been a croak.
[00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:39.291]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:40.011]  Get it today.
[00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:40.631]  Limited run.
[00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:42.012]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:05:42.012 --> 00:05:46.653]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.653 --> 00:05:50.014]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:52.334]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:05:52.334 --> 00:05:53.755]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:55.695]  We're changing the world together.
[00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:56.696]  You are the Infowar.
[00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:57.456]  God bless you all.
[00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:03.866]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:15.299]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition.
[00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:15.639]  I think?
[00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:47.088]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:06:47.088 --> 00:06:49.971]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:56.616]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free, AAA253-3139.
[00:06:59.358 --> 00:07:03.360]  A new shipment of BioTrue Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.821]  We've been sold out for months.
[00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:09.884]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife BioTrue Selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:09.884 --> 00:07:14.027]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[00:07:14.027 --> 00:07:18.569]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:21.771]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:07:23.692 --> 00:07:27.174]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[00:07:27.174 --> 00:07:39.421]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system, to DNA production and eyesight, BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Basin Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:44.323]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTrue Selenium before we sell it again.
[00:07:44.323 --> 00:07:52.327]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:52.548]  A 360 win.
[00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:55.450]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.951]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[00:07:56.951 --> 00:08:01.115]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:03.778]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:03.778 --> 00:08:08.903]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:31.942 --> 00:08:41.727]  The gravity of where this country and this world is, I don't think I can tell anybody watching or listening.
[00:08:43.035 --> 00:09:04.343]  That we are in a group of cascading crises globally that are only intensifying, and the special interests running our world seem to be asleep at the switch, just busily stealing as much resources as they can, and then arrogantly walking around talking about how powerful and invincible they are.
[00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:08.745]  The stuff that failure is made of, pride goes before a fall.
[00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:16.321]  A fool has said in his heart, there is no God but me.
[00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:22.688]  To paraphrase the Bible.
[00:09:22.688 --> 00:09:25.571]  Let me just get right to it.
[00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:31.878]  We have watched and chronicled most prominent rock stars, hip-hop people,
[00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:59.673]  Hollywood types making vicious anti-Trump statements, anti-conservative statements, anti-American statements, cheerleading our economy falling apart, cheerleading that the agenda to restart the economy fail, attacking Trump's children, grandchildren, and calling for his death.
[00:10:00.632 --> 00:10:13.200]  And then having articles every time I cover it, in the same publications that call for rioting and call for the President's death, Newsweek Time, they will then say I'm insane, no one has said that.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.184]  And then not show where they said it a month or two before.
[00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:24.748]  Now think of how they sit there as known inverters of logic and truth and lie to you.
[00:10:24.748 --> 00:10:25.769]  Just last week,
[00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:31.912]  August 4th, Deep State's gonna kill the President, Alex Jones claims.
[00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:44.661]  It goes on to say, with no proof, Jones says that there is a plan to kill the President, but then they link to articles saying Jones actually says kill Democrats.
[00:10:44.661 --> 00:10:48.644]  With no video, no proof, just total lies, just in Newsweek.
[00:10:48.644 --> 00:10:50.365]  Jones is a liar!
[00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:55.269]  He says kill Democrats, kill more Democrats is the quote.
[00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:05.121]  And it's a group of authors that link to each other's stories.
[00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:06.961]  It's incredible.
[00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:18.725]  Now, the reason I raise this is you had two weeks ago Brennan coming out and saying, you know, there's already a plot going, not impeachment, but to suddenly remove the president.
[00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:25.467]  And then you've got Al Gore on Late Late Show three days later saying, oh, we're just going to remove him, bipartisan, and let's all work together.
[00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:27.488]  Same thing Brennan said, former head of the CIA.
[00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:32.564]  The guy that arrogantly said, watch your mouth.
[00:11:32.564 --> 00:11:42.709]  And there's Clapper, former head of all intelligence, who illegally spied and lied to Congress and all this, agreeing with him saying, yes, yes, this is happening, and Blitzer's totally freaked out.
[00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:47.689]  Because, I mean, he's been in Israeli intelligence for 40-something years.
[00:11:47.689 --> 00:11:48.590]  I mean, he's a spy.
[00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.612]  He's a leftist Israeli operative.
[00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:55.875]  He knows how serious it is to be discussing coup plans in public.
[00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:58.737]  He doesn't even know how to speak.
[00:11:58.737 --> 00:11:59.918]  He tries to correct them.
[00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:01.800]  And they say, no, no, Wolf, we're doing this.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.261]  We're moving now outside of law.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.221]  We are going to ignore his orders and we're going to remove it.
[00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:11.102]  And the plan is already in motion in the next few months.
[00:12:11.102 --> 00:12:11.863]  I'm not going to play the clip again.
[00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:13.623]  I've already played it like ten times.
[00:12:13.623 --> 00:12:15.144]  I'm going to play the new clip right now.
[00:12:15.144 --> 00:12:19.886]  Because there's so many of these.
[00:12:19.886 --> 00:12:23.068]  I've got a compilation of them we're going to play a little bit later.
[00:12:23.068 --> 00:12:28.631]  Where they have, not your average CIA person, but Philip Mudd.
[00:12:30.555 --> 00:12:36.818]  You want to go down a rabbit trail, there's all sorts of investigations and criminal investigations and lawsuits.
[00:12:36.818 --> 00:12:47.644]  This guy is the guy that ran the CIA torture operations.
[00:12:47.644 --> 00:12:50.146]  The mind control operations, all of it.
[00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:53.728]  I want to say ran, a liaison in the middle of all of it.
[00:12:56.656 --> 00:12:57.456]  Just type in his name.
[00:12:57.456 --> 00:12:58.837]  It's all over the news.
[00:12:58.837 --> 00:13:00.257]  A huge scandal.
[00:13:00.257 --> 00:13:04.419]  On and on and on.
[00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:17.123]  Then he's sent in by Obama to take over the FBI and to put the CIA in every department and start running operations against the FBI.
[00:13:17.123 --> 00:13:22.565]  Oh, but they spin that that he was the director of their counter-terrorism division.
[00:13:25.376 --> 00:13:26.497]  And it goes on and on.
[00:13:26.497 --> 00:13:34.400]  So, this guy goes on CNN and says the deep state is going to kill this guy.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.062]  The quote is, the government's going to kill this guy.
[00:13:40.062 --> 00:13:50.627]  I mean, the incredible arrogance of Brennan saying, you better watch your mouth, the president-elect, and then couldn't believe it when Trump fired him.
[00:13:50.627 --> 00:13:53.008]  He said, I can't believe it.
[00:13:53.008 --> 00:13:54.609]  He said, I thought it was a joke.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.906]  All these guys are arrogant because they own America.
[00:14:03.906 --> 00:14:05.127]  They run America.
[00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:07.208]  They get money from Saudi Arabia.
[00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:08.569]  They open the borders.
[00:14:08.569 --> 00:14:12.953]  They take Muslims off the terror list and don't let the FBI investigate them under Mueller.
[00:14:12.953 --> 00:14:14.814]  And it's still basically that way.
[00:14:14.814 --> 00:14:15.955]  And Trump's trying to change it.
[00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:18.497]  And Schumer says, oh, Trump's going to get in trouble.
[00:14:18.497 --> 00:14:19.778]  We've been spying on him.
[00:14:19.778 --> 00:14:22.781]  The intelligence community has seven ways this Sunday to bring you down.
[00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:25.443]  Oh, but nobody's planning to bring the president down.
[00:14:25.443 --> 00:14:26.424]  Now they've got
[00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:34.252]  They've got one of the real nasties.
[00:14:34.252 --> 00:14:38.015]  And he doesn't torture people to death.
[00:14:38.015 --> 00:14:39.697]  He doesn't bury people alive.
[00:14:39.697 --> 00:14:41.738]  He has people do it.
[00:14:41.738 --> 00:14:46.102]  And they have CIA psychiatrists that then carry it out.
[00:14:46.102 --> 00:14:50.246]  I wonder what Dr. Puccini can tell us about stuff like that.
[00:14:52.674 --> 00:14:56.475]  But he'd tell you there's much better ways to get things out of people than doing that.
[00:14:56.475 --> 00:15:03.196]  But see, it's so much fun, though, and it's so powerful when you're somebody like Mr. Mudd.
[00:15:03.196 --> 00:15:09.877]  Do I need to say, your name is Mudd with us, sir?
[00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:12.938]  I mean, you people are crazy!
[00:15:12.938 --> 00:15:22.180]  You're on television saying, there's a plot to kill the president, we're gonna play the clip, and then I started searching, you're all over the place as a CNN employee.
[00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:40.197]  Shooting your mouth off about how you're going to physically assault Congressman Gowdy.
[00:15:40.197 --> 00:15:42.137]  It's incredible.
[00:15:42.137 --> 00:15:42.918]  It's amazing.
[00:15:42.918 --> 00:15:44.978]  It's over the top.
[00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:48.160]  The Secret Service visited Pastor Brown
[00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:54.485]  After he met with the President, met with senior members of Congress that told him there is a plan to kill the President.
[00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:56.286]  When he first came on, they just said, remove him suddenly.
[00:15:56.286 --> 00:15:57.826]  He talked to his congressional source.
[00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.927]  They said, no, no, no, no, they mean kill.
[00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:03.127]  Yes, they say suddenly, without warning.
[00:16:03.127 --> 00:16:04.608]  Neutralize is a word they use.
[00:16:04.608 --> 00:16:05.768]  Yes, neutralize means kill.
[00:16:05.768 --> 00:16:10.569]  I want to get him back on Sunday if we can.
[00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:13.590]  The Sunday broadcast.
[00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.791]  They send the Secret Service to him and kind of acted like maybe he was bad.
[00:16:19.127 --> 00:16:30.410]  The Secret Service isn't going to go talk to Mr. Mudd because this is the new deep state royalty.
[00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.650]  I mean, he can go on CNN.
[00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.111]  We're getting ready to kill the president.
[00:16:34.111 --> 00:16:36.872]  You know, I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:44.894]  I'm so upset by this, but as an American, my brain instantly, when I saw this, went into modes it's never even been into.
[00:16:44.894 --> 00:16:46.074]  I mean, I was, it was like,
[00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:49.686]  Understanding, I'm not even angry at this guy.
[00:16:49.686 --> 00:16:54.268]  I was realizing, something has to be done to these people, and now.
[00:16:54.268 --> 00:16:57.690]  I mean, they need to be getting SWAT teamed today.
[00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:06.015]  They need to get their ass hauled up in front of a grand jury, indicted, and sent to Leavenworth.
[00:17:06.015 --> 00:17:09.697]  I mean, this is... Third world countries don't act like this!
[00:17:09.697 --> 00:17:10.857]  This is crazy!
[00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:28.896]  The hubris, the arrogance, the bravado, the danger of a senior CIA guy, controlled by the Clintons and Mueller, and they are so incensed and so getting ready and plotting to kill the President that they're probably trying to kill him every day.
[00:17:28.896 --> 00:17:30.057]  They're trying to poison his food.
[00:17:30.057 --> 00:17:31.838]  You know it!
[00:17:31.838 --> 00:17:38.082]  And they're on television with the ongoing coup plan built up to it.
[00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:42.345]  And by the way, if Americans think you're going to sit around and eat popcorn when all this goes down,
[00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:47.921]  It's going to implode the economy, and they're going to go for broke.
[00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:50.222]  You can't just say you're going to kill the President.
[00:17:50.222 --> 00:17:52.244]  Here's the takeaway.
[00:17:52.244 --> 00:18:11.937]  They're saying they're going to kill the President in the open, this was all staged, because they need to get it green-lighted, because they're getting trouble getting it lined up inside the government, because there's a civil war going on, like on the deck of the ship, mutiny on the bounty, people deciding which side of the ship they're going to go to.
[00:18:11.937 --> 00:18:14.199]  I know which side, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
[00:18:15.472 --> 00:18:27.222]  The election we had, the honor and the duty and the courage of Trump to absolutely bulldoggedly ignore the attacks and the lies and the disinformation and the death threats.
[00:18:27.222 --> 00:18:33.947]  I am not just going to continue to pledge that I'm standing with Donald Trump and this Republic.
[00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:42.214]  I am honored and just embarrassed of myself that a few times I thought, should I a little bit halfway hedge my bet
[00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:46.076]  Because who knows what's going on in this whole operation.
[00:18:46.076 --> 00:18:50.282]  They could dig something up or make something up and then it'll fall back and look bad on me.
[00:18:50.282 --> 00:18:53.026]  And I'm like, no, I'm 100% totally in.
[00:18:53.026 --> 00:18:55.129]  This is what we're made for.
[00:18:55.129 --> 00:18:55.590]  Skip this break.
[00:18:57.219 --> 00:19:02.304]  We are designed to have clear-cut decisions of good versus evil like this.
[00:19:02.304 --> 00:19:06.488]  And if folks don't pick the right side, it is so dishonorable.
[00:19:06.488 --> 00:19:12.674]  But you're also missing out on being able to really be involved in the retaking of this country.
[00:19:12.674 --> 00:19:15.958]  Because let me give you the big news, folks.
[00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:16.959]  We are winning.
[00:19:16.959 --> 00:19:18.000]  They could kill Trump.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.901]  They can kill me.
[00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:21.083]  And believe me, if they take Trump out,
[00:19:26.715 --> 00:19:31.836]  They're going to come after everybody and everybody's got to be ready.
[00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:34.437]  And I'll tell you, we don't need to go on the run.
[00:19:34.437 --> 00:19:35.857]  That's all I'm going to say.
[00:19:35.857 --> 00:19:40.038]  You're not going to have to come looking for me, you killed the President.
[00:19:40.038 --> 00:19:41.199]  And I mean it!
[00:19:41.199 --> 00:19:43.899]  I'm done!
[00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:46.060]  So, that's the way it is right now!
[00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:54.029]  They're unbelievable criminals.
[00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:58.674]  I mean, my God, they are on TV saying they're gonna beat up Gowdy.
[00:19:58.674 --> 00:20:01.336]  These Clinton thugs.
[00:20:01.336 --> 00:20:05.520]  And so many people they've killed in the investigations.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.224]  So many people that are just little people that saw something or heard something.
[00:20:10.224 --> 00:20:13.107]  Just to make sure everything's clean, they kill them.
[00:20:13.107 --> 00:20:15.209]  Mothers, fathers, young people, children.
[00:20:17.165 --> 00:20:19.586]  Oh, you see a CIA plane come in with drugs?
[00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:22.788]  Kill the 12 and 13 year old boys, put their bodies on the railroad tracks.
[00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:23.168]  Why?
[00:20:23.168 --> 00:20:24.309]  They didn't do anything.
[00:20:24.309 --> 00:20:26.650]  You ran the whole sheriff's department, the whole police department.
[00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:33.013]  You just killed them because you got people on staff that just want to kill a couple little kids!
[00:20:33.013 --> 00:20:34.294]  That's who you are!
[00:20:34.294 --> 00:20:41.898]  And as we all know in this life, when things come to this type of level, we're going to find out who everybody is.
[00:20:43.433 --> 00:20:52.679]  And know this, you reap what you sow, Hillary Clinton.
[00:20:52.679 --> 00:21:05.366]  Fill up mud, a disgrace to this country.
[00:21:05.366 --> 00:21:07.848]  And our media, which is globalist,
[00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:12.819]  Trump's quote was if they do anything unwise and attack us.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:51.514]  But again, everything is misrepresented because we've got globalists that are so corrupt, and so evil, and so out of control, and so bad, that they instinctively side with North Korea, just like 1994, when they gave nuclear reactors and the missile secrets, and Jimmy Carter went over and delivered it to them for Bill Clinton, and then our media turns around and blames our president?
[00:21:53.482 --> 00:21:58.223]  And says he's endangering us with North Korea and Russia, so he needs to die?
[00:21:58.223 --> 00:22:03.304]  That's what Mudd's saying, in the context.
[00:22:03.304 --> 00:22:06.064]  You people presided over the Arab Spring!
[00:22:06.064 --> 00:22:08.445]  You presided over empowering North Korea!
[00:22:08.445 --> 00:22:10.545]  You presided over imploding our borders!
[00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:13.586]  You presided over all of this!
[00:22:13.586 --> 00:22:21.347]  Over sabotaging the nationalist Chiang Kai-shek!
[00:22:23.416 --> 00:22:45.320]  And putting Mouse a tongue in power to kill 80 million of his own people, and now that big giant slave-powered superpower is over there with nuclear weapons and just arrogantly thumbing it in our face, infiltrating all the agencies, the government, the bureaucracies, in just that cold, soulless, communist, robotic way, communist meets capitalist way.
[00:22:53.959 --> 00:22:55.745]  And then we get... Mr. Mud.
[00:22:59.022 --> 00:23:12.851]  He's betting it that, oh, we shut down these Russian embassies and buildings, diplomatic buildings, and so they've shut down the equal number and mainly just kicked out their Russian employees that are there, you know, typists and stuff like that.
[00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:18.195]  And Mudd then spins it around that our CIA people are being kicked out.
[00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:21.036]  I mean, you're not even supposed to say it's CIA people at the State Department.
[00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:22.077]  And he knows that.
[00:23:22.077 --> 00:23:23.418]  But see, none of that matters.
[00:23:23.418 --> 00:23:25.119]  They spy on us illegally.
[00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:26.300]  They control the economy.
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.561]  They give themselves all the plump.
[00:23:28.842 --> 00:23:34.345]  Jobs, they shut down their competition, they perch on us like Kim Jong-un does North Korea.
[00:23:34.345 --> 00:23:45.132]  It's just that America was so great and so rich and so much more free that they've gotten away with so much more and we haven't noticed all the parasitic stuff as bad.
[00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:53.178]  They're eating through the resources and putting us all in debt and then admitting under Obama internment camp plans for 50 million Americans.
[00:23:53.178 --> 00:23:54.899]  I mean that was real army manuals.
[00:23:56.018 --> 00:24:00.361]  That were declassified in 2010!
[00:24:00.361 --> 00:24:10.306]  Army.mil, how to process your social security numbers, and they use the Soviet term, re-education camp!
[00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:18.051]  That's like saying, and we send you to, you know, Dachau.
[00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:21.613]  I mean, why even put Dachau on the name of it?
[00:24:21.613 --> 00:24:24.555]  It's all just meant to completely normalize it.
[00:24:26.283 --> 00:24:36.292]  And just say, we're going to implode the economy, we're going to have the haves and have-nots, we're going to have ration cards, we're going to control people through food, so they want you all dependent on them, and they're going to have social engineering.
[00:24:36.292 --> 00:24:42.397]  You think the collectivism and the communism and the wordsmithing and the brainwashing and the political correctness is bad now?
[00:24:42.397 --> 00:24:44.138]  This is nothing!
[00:24:44.138 --> 00:24:45.439]  And then all the raging
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:52.364]  Universities swollen to the busting point for their malice revolution that was already supposed to be happening with Hillary in right now.
[00:24:52.364 --> 00:24:56.326]  They're contained and they've been promised jobs and power.
[00:24:56.326 --> 00:24:57.807]  I mean, we go to these malice meetings.
[00:24:57.807 --> 00:24:58.588]  We've infiltrated them.
[00:24:59.673 --> 00:25:08.398]  I mean, they're quasi-public, and they're talking up there with professors and city officials, and they get government money, how they're going to be running this department, how they're going to be running that department.
[00:25:08.398 --> 00:25:11.140]  And they do run things here in Austin.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.061]  They do run things in San Francisco.
[00:25:13.061 --> 00:25:15.342]  They're not well-meaning liberals.
[00:25:15.342 --> 00:25:24.647]  They are hardcore, vicious authoritarians that read books about authoritarianism and thought, I want that job!
[00:25:24.647 --> 00:25:25.268]  Well, you know what?
[00:25:25.268 --> 00:25:26.549]  I read those same books.
[00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:27.689]  And you know what I want?
[00:25:27.689 --> 00:25:28.510]  I'm going to stop you.
[00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:38.058]  Our listeners are going to stop you cold and stop you dead.
[00:25:38.058 --> 00:25:47.065]  And you know, I've got to get over the fact that whatever happens to me or my family now, or you or anybody else in this is, we didn't ask for this, we didn't do this.
[00:25:47.065 --> 00:25:50.468]  When you kiss your children goodbye, when you go to school or when they put them to bed at night,
[00:25:51.502 --> 00:25:54.544]  Don't think that, oh, if you stay on the sidelines, they'll be safe.
[00:25:54.544 --> 00:26:00.607]  You're going to kiss their whole future and their whole world goodbye if you don't put it on the line right now.
[00:26:00.607 --> 00:26:02.588]  And just say, I am committed.
[00:26:02.588 --> 00:26:03.689]  You want to bang heads?
[00:26:03.689 --> 00:26:04.829]  You want to play chicken?
[00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:13.454]  I'm pressing the accelerator down, and I'm bracing, and I'm ready to go to nirvana.
[00:26:13.454 --> 00:26:15.335]  Because our children shouldn't have to play chicken.
[00:26:17.628 --> 00:26:21.051]  Some of us are going to have to bang heads to make sure they've got a future.
[00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:25.114]  Because the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:26:25.114 --> 00:26:28.416]  That's Thomas Jefferson, my friends.
[00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:29.817]  I don't have a death wish.
[00:26:29.817 --> 00:26:31.218]  I don't have any of that.
[00:26:31.218 --> 00:26:37.082]  I existentially know these people are evil, they're authoritarian, they're oppressors.
[00:26:37.082 --> 00:26:38.884]  They are the filth of the earth!
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:27:00.450]  And they have sided with radical Islam that they used to set up their police state, and now they're going to flip that around, it's even in their own documents, and go after Christians, and conservatives, and libertarians, and patriots, and patriots in our own government, in our own media, in our own systems, turned this around, desperately fought the election, stopped Hillary, who thought it was going to be given to her.
[00:27:01.479 --> 00:27:04.160]  Did steal five states, failed to steal six.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.363]  They are hopping mad because they were ready to go with the plan you're already seeing.
[00:27:10.363 --> 00:27:12.144]  Don't you understand?
[00:27:12.144 --> 00:27:16.346]  I know what they're going to do because I already knew what the plan was.
[00:27:16.346 --> 00:27:19.027]  Most of it's public.
[00:27:19.027 --> 00:27:21.388]  The only thing new is they want to kill Trump.
[00:27:21.388 --> 00:27:26.130]  But first they've got to kill him in your minds if they really get his poll numbers down.
[00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:35.516]  Then they've got to kill him using a right winger or some nut that they claim was, you know, mad at Trump for, you know, something.
[00:27:35.516 --> 00:27:36.777]  You can see how this can be scripted.
[00:27:36.777 --> 00:27:40.880]  Or they're going to poison him and see how to stroke.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.043]  And then, so they can fight over the power, they'll, oh, we don't know how he was going to come out of it or not.
[00:27:45.043 --> 00:27:51.027]  They just, you know, got him at the Naval Center or wherever, drugged up.
[00:27:51.027 --> 00:27:51.748]  This is happening now.
[00:27:52.745 --> 00:27:55.827]  And of course you know the President's security people are watching.
[00:27:55.827 --> 00:27:56.207]  They know.
[00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:57.908]  They're not getting this from me.
[00:27:57.908 --> 00:27:58.289]  They know.
[00:27:58.289 --> 00:28:03.872]  They just tune in because it's the one place you can really get what's going on.
[00:28:03.872 --> 00:28:11.538]  That's why suddenly Sean Hannity is saying the exact words, the exact facts, because they create transcripts, Patriots and the government go, this is dead on.
[00:28:12.506 --> 00:28:14.667]  Hannity's never had people fill his teleprompter.
[00:28:14.667 --> 00:28:18.609]  He's working with high-level folks because people now know this is real.
[00:28:18.609 --> 00:28:20.109]  And it's not about me getting credit.
[00:28:20.109 --> 00:28:27.232]  If you want to understand why they're coming after us, it's because we are directly over the enemy command base, dropping 10,000-pound bombs on them.
[00:28:27.232 --> 00:28:30.154]  Boom, boom, boom, politically.
[00:28:30.154 --> 00:28:34.075]  And they are just freaking out because we've got their whole operation.
[00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:38.377]  So now they're flipping it around and going, OK, we'll hide it in plain view and act like it's a good thing.
[00:28:38.377 --> 00:28:40.238]  We're going to kill him when he's popular.
[00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:48.487]  Man, you people are crazy.
[00:28:48.487 --> 00:28:52.549]  I'm going to tell the police and everybody else, you better choose which side you're on right now.
[00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:56.191]  And you better think about who is in command in your departments and who they are.
[00:28:56.191 --> 00:29:00.592]  And you better do your search engines on them and find out who they work for and who they've been with.
[00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:08.276]  And if they've been deep state with the Democrats, these big foundations, or been RINOs, they're basically enemy soldiers when they pull the trigger on this.
[00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:10.636]  You have to choose sides now.
[00:29:10.636 --> 00:29:11.697]  Are you with George Washington?
[00:29:14.594 --> 00:29:17.415]  Are you with Hillary Clinton?
[00:29:17.415 --> 00:29:20.135]  God's making this show cut and dry.
[00:29:20.135 --> 00:29:24.956]  Alright, I'm going to play the clips of this guy when we come back.
[00:29:24.956 --> 00:29:26.276]  And we put this video out from the last show.
[00:29:26.276 --> 00:29:28.557]  We'll obviously put it on the front.
[00:29:28.557 --> 00:29:31.858]  But these are the times that try our souls.
[00:29:31.858 --> 00:29:37.099]  And they're now on CNN saying they're preparing with high-level CIA people to kill the President.
[00:29:37.099 --> 00:29:38.499]  And they're going to come after everybody else.
[00:29:40.336 --> 00:29:41.297]  They want to break this country.
[00:29:41.297 --> 00:29:42.239]  They want to break your children.
[00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:43.741]  They want to sexualize your children.
[00:29:43.741 --> 00:29:46.124]  That's their main mission.
[00:29:46.124 --> 00:29:47.746]  Oh, Hillary, by the way, just got caught more sexually.
[00:29:47.746 --> 00:29:49.108]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.108 --> 00:29:50.711]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:54.316]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:01.450]  Why is the fungus?
[00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:02.551]  Why is the mold?
[00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:04.292]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:30:04.292 --> 00:30:05.253]  What is going on?
[00:30:05.253 --> 00:30:05.993]  What has changed?
[00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:31.730]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.911]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:30:32.911 --> 00:30:33.712]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:30:33.712 --> 00:30:35.173]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:30:35.173 --> 00:30:39.716]  MycoZX antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[00:30:39.716 --> 00:30:40.536]  Get it today.
[00:30:40.536 --> 00:30:41.016]  Limited run.
[00:30:41.016 --> 00:30:42.417]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:30:42.417 --> 00:30:47.061]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:47.061 --> 00:30:50.423]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:30:50.423 --> 00:30:52.764]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:30:52.764 --> 00:30:54.165]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:30:54.165 --> 00:30:56.107]  We're changing the world together.
[00:30:56.107 --> 00:30:57.127]  You are the Infowar.
[00:30:57.127 --> 00:30:57.868]  God bless you all.
[00:30:59.577 --> 00:31:01.458]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.458 --> 00:31:03.479]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:06.401]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:12.464]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.464 --> 00:31:21.649]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:24.931]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[00:31:25.171 --> 00:31:28.954]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:28.954 --> 00:31:37.220]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.161]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:43.323]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.323 --> 00:31:46.907]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:46.907 --> 00:31:53.616]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.616 --> 00:31:57.801]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:26.848]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.848 --> 00:33:29.009]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:31.310]  It's a new world order.
[00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.451]  It's a new world order.
[00:33:34.451 --> 00:33:46.317]  It's a new world order.
[00:33:46.317 --> 00:33:51.179]  It's a new world order.
[00:33:51.179 --> 00:33:51.919]  Paul Watson is serious.
[00:33:53.562 --> 00:33:54.503]  You'll hear him here.
[00:33:54.503 --> 00:33:55.184]  You'll see him here.
[00:33:55.184 --> 00:33:59.788]  You'll see him, I guess, when we post videos to Facebook.
[00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:07.054]  But he is leaving YouTube because they have blocked or removed most of his videos.
[00:34:07.054 --> 00:34:15.982]  So YouTube is censoring 90 plus percent of the conservatives, of the libertarians, not just demonetizing.
[00:34:15.982 --> 00:34:21.827]  Diamonds and silt, really sweet, smart, great ladies, funny, really positive, bubbly.
[00:34:23.046 --> 00:34:24.707]  They've been banned.
[00:34:24.707 --> 00:34:26.408]  They've been demonetized.
[00:34:26.408 --> 00:34:27.548]  People say, well, leave YouTube.
[00:34:27.548 --> 00:34:29.109]  It's a monopoly.
[00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:31.070]  It's had monopolistic practices.
[00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.992]  It advertises as a free town square.
[00:34:33.992 --> 00:34:36.053]  You bring the YouTube.
[00:34:36.053 --> 00:34:38.154]  And then they selectively enforce it.
[00:34:38.154 --> 00:34:40.415]  They let leftists say, kill us.
[00:34:40.415 --> 00:34:41.515]  That's OK.
[00:34:41.515 --> 00:34:43.136]  They're now taking down conservative sites.
[00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:50.040]  If you show a Hitler clip and say, we've seen the dangers of big government before, then they say you're a Nazi and remove.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:50.620]  This has happened.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.081]  Paul gives examples.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.602]  This is happening to professors and people.
[00:34:56.602 --> 00:34:57.583]  They go, oh, you're a Nazi.
[00:34:57.583 --> 00:35:02.266]  And you go, the clip is of us saying we shouldn't repeat what the Nazis did.
[00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:03.988]  But even if you were, you should have that free speech.
[00:35:03.988 --> 00:35:05.429]  But see, that's how that works.
[00:35:05.429 --> 00:35:06.249]  It's everybody.
[00:35:06.249 --> 00:35:13.435]  We're going to be talking to Paul Watson in a moment, but he wrote the story that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:16.223 --> 00:35:25.728]  Thanks to YouTube, we're able to see, without watching CNN on a regular basis, we're able to have the viewers, HUMET, Human Intelligence, flag it, post it, bring it to us.
[00:35:25.728 --> 00:35:33.272]  But, oh, don't worry, CNN won't take down the high-level CIA official who also works for CNN.
[00:35:33.272 --> 00:35:38.074]  This isn't some CIA guy like Anderson Cooper that just does it because it impresses his friends.
[00:35:38.074 --> 00:35:42.657]  CIA analyst on Trump, the government's going to kill this guy.
[00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:43.877]  Well, who is that analyst?
[00:35:43.877 --> 00:35:45.098]  It's Philip Mudd.
[00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:53.670]  Who ran the CIA's torture operations.
[00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.031]  They call it enhanced interrogation.
[00:35:56.031 --> 00:35:59.571]  Rough interrogations.
[00:35:59.571 --> 00:36:09.233]  I guess next time I shoot an elk right in the head, that's an intense interrogation.
[00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:14.514]  And the whole point is that this is the killing end, the torturing end of the CIA.
[00:36:16.567 --> 00:36:21.490]  This isn't the Anderson Cooper wing of it.
[00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:40.181]  And it's the Democrat-controlled operative who was brought in by the Democrats, his appointments by Democrats, and then Mueller, the globalist operative, put him in over a new department of the FBI under Obama, basically having the CIA begin to take control of the FBI.
[00:36:40.181 --> 00:36:45.884]  This is incredible, under the guise of creating a counterterrorism information center.
[00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:50.560]  And he is the one.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.262]  In this context, we're going to Paul.
[00:36:54.262 --> 00:36:58.884]  As they build towards this coup, the censorship is hundreds of times what it's ever been conservatively.
[00:36:58.884 --> 00:36:59.644]  It's massive.
[00:36:59.644 --> 00:37:01.825]  Google, Facebook, Twitter are admitting censoring.
[00:37:01.825 --> 00:37:04.326]  They're censoring the president's tweets.
[00:37:04.326 --> 00:37:05.747]  They're blocking his son's tweets.
[00:37:05.747 --> 00:37:07.028]  They're blocking Drudge.
[00:37:07.028 --> 00:37:09.309]  Sending out jobs numbers from CNBC.
[00:37:10.748 --> 00:37:12.230]  Saying this is improper content?
[00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:25.204]  I mean, you know when they're moving that they go to levels of censorship that totally discredit them and makes the public turn against them because they don't have a choice because they've decided to try to have an authoritarian takeover.
[00:37:27.213 --> 00:37:30.155]  And they're going to try to sell that to the military and sell it to the police.
[00:37:30.155 --> 00:37:34.259]  But the good news is the military and police have woken up to a lot of this.
[00:37:34.259 --> 00:37:37.561]  And so this is amazing time to be alive.
[00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:38.742]  But they don't care.
[00:37:38.742 --> 00:37:42.065]  Just like they had Madam President stuff already printed up that she was going to be the president.
[00:37:42.065 --> 00:37:43.006]  They had fake photos.
[00:37:43.006 --> 00:37:45.588]  Here she is winning that night.
[00:37:45.588 --> 00:37:46.869]  All fake.
[00:37:46.869 --> 00:37:48.891]  Because they're that confident.
[00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:56.924]  You analyze this thing, and I've talked to people that have overthrown governments, been involved in analyzing coups.
[00:37:56.924 --> 00:38:03.207]  This is not a good prospect for these people.
[00:38:03.207 --> 00:38:07.129]  I mean, what are they going to do when they've all been saying kill the president, and then they killed him?
[00:38:09.073 --> 00:38:13.277]  They've got emoms saying kill gay people, cut women's genitals off, literally.
[00:38:13.277 --> 00:38:21.386]  They've got emoms on YouTube praising the Pulse nightclub massacre, but Paul Watson is having his videos removed and blocked on modern art.
[00:38:22.998 --> 00:38:28.622]  Being funded by the CIA, and he shows the CIA admitting that they want ugly art and ugly culture.
[00:38:28.622 --> 00:38:29.462]  That's why they're mad.
[00:38:29.462 --> 00:38:31.584]  Because who do you think runs Google?
[00:38:31.584 --> 00:38:35.967]  When I say CIA, I mean the big foundations that control it.
[00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:41.350]  The leftist, globalist, anti-human people that are at the top.
[00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.331]  We're going to Paul Watson, but here's the clips.
[00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:43.932]  Here's Trump.
[00:38:45.267 --> 00:38:49.869]  Making a joke about, you know, Russia closing some of the embassies to the U.S.
[00:38:49.869 --> 00:38:50.550]  as a retaliation.
[00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.711]  He goes, oh well, I guess we've got some layoffs.
[00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:54.412]  You know, we've cut some costs here.
[00:38:54.412 --> 00:38:56.713]  Because Trump's been cutting government everywhere.
[00:38:56.713 --> 00:39:02.616]  They turn that into some insult to the people in the State Department and the CIA people that are obviously there.
[00:39:03.796 --> 00:39:05.597]  As if people don't know that.
[00:39:05.597 --> 00:39:20.904]  And it's this little temper tantruming baby that wants to be more popular with his colleagues like Brennan and others that are on TV saying we're going to have a coup the next few months outside of the Constitution, outside of impeachment.
[00:39:20.904 --> 00:39:26.626]  He's going to be gone soon!
[00:39:26.626 --> 00:39:28.747]  I've never heard of something this crazy.
[00:39:28.747 --> 00:39:30.948]  I mean, hell, they might just
[00:39:33.072 --> 00:39:41.798]  Have Trump on a podium and just have somebody, maybe Hillary walks up and just shoots him right in the head and we just put a crown on her head right there and everybody falls down and calls her Madam President.
[00:39:41.798 --> 00:39:47.321]  I mean, that's absurdist, sounds like Monty Python, but they're doing this.
[00:39:47.321 --> 00:39:54.726]  And then Trump is sitting there surrounded by a bunch of cowards, most of them that are having drinks with the deep state, going, we'll keep you around once we take over.
[00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:55.787]  Hey, how's that deal going?
[00:39:56.007 --> 00:40:05.741]  People that just want money and position they've stolen and who want to squat over America and squat over flyover country that they've been parasitically feeding on and that they hate!
[00:40:05.741 --> 00:40:11.429]  Like Lloyd Blankfein putting out tweets going, China's got better infrastructure and I'm moving everything over there and America's a joke!
[00:40:12.816 --> 00:40:18.700]  That's Goldman Sachs that's used American power to take over the world, literally crapping on us and rubbing it in.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.582]  So, we're going to talk to Paul Watson about this in a moment.
[00:40:21.582 --> 00:40:28.886]  Here, ladies and gentlemen, is what Trump actually said, and then the response, saying the government is going to kill this guy.
[00:40:28.886 --> 00:40:29.287]  Here it is.
[00:40:39.178 --> 00:40:43.201]  No, I want to thank him because we're trying to cut down on payroll.
[00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:51.327]  And as far as I'm concerned, I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll.
[00:40:51.327 --> 00:40:54.249]  There's no real reason for them to go back.
[00:40:54.249 --> 00:40:59.092]  So I greatly appreciate the fact that they've been able to cut our payroll for the United States.
[00:40:59.092 --> 00:40:59.973]  We'll save a lot of money.
[00:41:02.396 --> 00:41:03.718]  What was your response, Phil Mudd?
[00:41:03.718 --> 00:41:04.879]  A couple surprises.
[00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:06.501]  Let me give you one bottom line.
[00:41:06.501 --> 00:41:09.625]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:41:09.625 --> 00:41:11.167]  He defends Vladimir Putin.
[00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:13.910]  Their State Department and CIA offers are coming home.
[00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:19.057]  And at Langley and in Foggy Bottoms, CIA and State, they're saying, this is how you defend us?
[00:41:19.057 --> 00:41:21.600]  Phil, before I may not want to answer your question, but Phil, just...
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:25.182]  To reiterate, obviously when you're talking about killing, you're using that as a metaphor.
[00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:29.145]  You're not talking about... What I'm saying is, people talk about the deep state.
[00:41:29.145 --> 00:41:34.309]  When you disrespect government officials who've done 20 or 30 years, they're going to say, really?
[00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:38.692]  Vladimir Putin sends officers home and you support him before you support his death?
[00:41:38.692 --> 00:41:39.973]  I just want to underline.
[00:41:39.973 --> 00:41:40.813]  Amanda, you're...
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.921]  He doesn't do the torturing.
[00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:58.704]  He just sits around and gets off on the power that he directed those programs and then directed the takeover of the FBI by the CIA for Obama in this deep state coup.
[00:41:58.704 --> 00:42:04.926]  And then he's on CNN trying to show off and blurting out what they've got planned, what they're setting up.
[00:42:04.926 --> 00:42:11.489]  So, the president needs to move against this guy.
[00:42:11.489 --> 00:42:14.030]  And, I mean, is this America?
[00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.010]  Is this who we are?
[00:42:17.639 --> 00:42:20.440]  You got a guy saying we're going to kill the president.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.582]  What would you do if you saw mud walking down the street now?
[00:42:26.582 --> 00:42:38.645]  I mean, I feel guilty as a man that I am not getting in a car and going to try to have a talk with this fella.
[00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:48.633]  Because at some point, these people have to understand, you're not America.
[00:42:48.633 --> 00:42:50.394]  You don't get to run the shots anymore.
[00:42:50.394 --> 00:42:53.016]  You don't get to sell us out to China and everybody anymore.
[00:42:53.016 --> 00:42:58.701]  We're not going to bring in your 80% military-age men to repopulate America, you anti-American.
[00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.683]  We are not putting up with you anymore.
[00:43:01.683 --> 00:43:04.205]  And I'm obviously not going to do anything violent.
[00:43:04.205 --> 00:43:05.746]  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
[00:43:05.746 --> 00:43:06.326]  I couldn't even...
[00:43:09.249 --> 00:43:11.809]  Probably beat up a child.
[00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:13.190]  I'll never do anything to anybody.
[00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:17.851]  The whole point is, is that they're the ones calling for violence.
[00:43:17.851 --> 00:43:19.411]  They're the ones constantly pushing it.
[00:43:19.411 --> 00:43:27.792]  And how far will it go when somebody that's run divisions of the real killers, not him, is now saying it?
[00:43:27.792 --> 00:43:37.094]  I mean, this is a clear and present danger with the history, the means, the know-how, the connections, Deep State, the Clintons, Mueller, saying this on TV.
[00:43:40.782 --> 00:43:51.991]  It's like having a child molester next door to your house, and he moves in, and then he says he's going to rape your kids, and you just sit there and don't do anything about it.
[00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:52.952]  It's the same thing.
[00:43:52.952 --> 00:43:55.594]  I mean, this is what this guy does.
[00:43:55.594 --> 00:44:08.445]  This is what, overthrowing, killing, torturing, and he's on TV on a propaganda network, breathlessly saying the deep state's going to kill him, and he also says that he wants to kick Trey Gowdy's butt.
[00:44:09.275 --> 00:44:10.216]  We're going to play that clip.
[00:44:10.216 --> 00:44:14.240]  Paul Watson, thank you for joining us here today.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:20.626]  You know, it's cold in the studio, but I start sweating when I get this.
[00:44:20.626 --> 00:44:22.128]  It's not this angry.
[00:44:22.128 --> 00:44:25.551]  My metabolic system starts really kicking into gear here.
[00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:30.957]  When you see a capo of Murder Incorporated,
[00:44:32.278 --> 00:44:40.502]  They're supposed to be focused at bad guys like Kim Jong-un and Al-Qaeda in America going, we run things, we'll kill the President, you're gonna do what we say!
[00:44:40.502 --> 00:44:43.664]  And Clapper saying, shut your mouth, President!
[00:44:43.664 --> 00:44:45.785]  And Schumer, you shut your mouth, President!
[00:44:45.785 --> 00:44:48.467]  We got seven ways to take you out!
[00:44:48.467 --> 00:44:55.690]  It's always the little wimps that tell the people to go do the killing that are the ones that want to push it and think they're God.
[00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:56.591]  Paul, what do you make of this?
[00:44:58.214 --> 00:44:59.475]  I mean, it's incredible, Alex.
[00:44:59.475 --> 00:45:01.637]  You mentioned just that this is nothing new.
[00:45:01.637 --> 00:45:10.445]  Chuck Schumer implied the same thing before was it even, you know, before Trump even took office when he said they've got seven ways from Sunday from getting back at you.
[00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:24.237]  Now, watch that clip again and notice when Jake Tapper gets all flustered and realize what's going on, he comes back to him and says, oh, you mean metaphorically, you know, like say, yeah, yeah, dismisses it and then goes on to double down.
[00:45:24.777 --> 00:45:29.619]  By pointing out, oh, the deep state is going to be really pissed off with him now that he's said this.
[00:45:29.619 --> 00:45:32.820]  So he actually, he doesn't even deny it.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:33.680]  He doubles down on it.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.740]  He does the proviso.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.741]  He does the proviso.
[00:45:35.741 --> 00:45:42.923]  It'd be like if somebody said, go to Mudd's house, which I'm not saying this, go to Mudd's house and kill him, because he's a traitor and deserves it.
[00:45:42.923 --> 00:45:45.824]  But then you add, oh, but I'm just being metaphorical.
[00:45:45.824 --> 00:45:51.266]  But he's really a bad guy and needs to, you know, be found hanging from his neck, which I'm not really saying.
[00:45:51.266 --> 00:45:51.566]  But see,
[00:45:53.686 --> 00:46:02.248]  Now bear in mind, Alex, Pastor Rodney Brown, who merely said, I spoke to a congressman who warned me that they're going to try and take out Trump.
[00:46:02.248 --> 00:46:04.149]  No, that wasn't a direct threat at all.
[00:46:04.149 --> 00:46:04.909]  It was a warning.
[00:46:04.909 --> 00:46:07.610]  It was an attempt to protect the president.
[00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.951]  He got a secret service visit.
[00:46:09.951 --> 00:46:12.411]  Is this guy going to get a secret service visit?
[00:46:12.411 --> 00:46:18.073]  I mean, in the very least, he needs to come out with a full public statement right now, retracting, apologizing.
[00:46:18.893 --> 00:46:23.016]  Because this is absolutely bizarre, the fact that you would come out with this.
[00:46:23.016 --> 00:46:29.681]  But again, it shows how brazen they are now, and how up on the high horse they think they are with this Russian collusion crap.
[00:46:29.681 --> 00:46:47.012]  Even as it collapses, I mean, The Nation, a big left-wing publication, came out yesterday and admitted there's no evidence, which is why they're literally now going after apartments that Trump rented to Russians six years ago, and trying to get him on that, because there's no evidence whatsoever.
[00:46:47.012 --> 00:46:48.273]  They're starting to panic.
[00:46:49.234 --> 00:46:51.216]  And now these threats are becoming more known.
[00:46:51.216 --> 00:46:54.599]  But I mean, Alex, they must be just completely bombarded.
[00:46:54.599 --> 00:47:04.507]  I mean, the Secret Service, when you have the mainstream media legitimizing violence against the president, they just must be dealing with threats multiple times daily.
[00:47:04.507 --> 00:47:08.731]  You have people scaling the White House fence over and over again.
[00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:12.775]  You have people within the Secret Service saying they wouldn't protect Trump.
[00:47:13.275 --> 00:47:13.856]  I don't know.
[00:47:33.895 --> 00:47:35.615]  Over two years now.
[00:47:35.615 --> 00:47:38.816]  Now it's literally being paraded out on CNN.
[00:47:38.816 --> 00:47:42.097]  Oh, but we're bad because we say we don't want a civil war.
[00:47:42.097 --> 00:47:46.797]  By the way, Trump's telling the Secret Service he wants to walk at the front of motorcades.
[00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.118]  He wants to do more rallies.
[00:47:48.118 --> 00:47:50.118]  He's countermanding them and doing that.
[00:47:50.118 --> 00:47:53.099]  And it's not that he wants to die, but he's very fatalistic.
[00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:54.519]  Trump is committed.
[00:47:54.519 --> 00:47:55.779]  He doesn't care what happens.
[00:47:55.779 --> 00:47:56.779]  He's all in.
[00:47:56.779 --> 00:47:58.500]  That is so manly.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.660]  He is delivered.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.740]  He is so good.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:06.704]  And I have to say it, I just cannot, I am ashamed that he isn't getting more support.
[00:48:06.704 --> 00:48:08.946]  This is everything we ever asked for.
[00:48:08.946 --> 00:48:20.155]  And we've got the dug-in, evil government trying to block the reforms to make the country successful and decent again, when we see how it's just coming back from the dead with just a few things he's gotten done.
[00:48:21.036 --> 00:48:30.623]  And they are just howling and screaming and everywhere, saying, we've got an ongoing operation, he'll be gone the next few months, and it's not going to be, you know, through impeachment or grand juries.
[00:48:30.623 --> 00:48:36.628]  They're saying, in Congress, yes, get ready, he's going to be killed, you better get behind us going after him.
[00:48:36.628 --> 00:48:38.149]  See, it's chicken and the egg.
[00:48:38.149 --> 00:48:42.752]  They're saying, we're going to take him out, so they're going and asking Congressmen, what are you going to do?
[00:48:42.752 --> 00:48:43.653]  I've gotten these phone calls.
[00:48:44.173 --> 00:48:45.994]  What are you going to do when this happens?
[00:48:45.994 --> 00:48:48.694]  Because you just need to stand down and not do anything, okay?
[00:48:48.694 --> 00:48:49.855]  No, that's how they get us all.
[00:48:49.855 --> 00:48:53.956]  That's how the Bolsheviks were able to take over all of Russia, okay?
[00:48:53.956 --> 00:48:54.596]  Incrementally.
[00:48:54.596 --> 00:48:57.717]  It was always, oh, getting this group to appease, then they'd kill them later.
[00:48:57.717 --> 00:48:58.197]  No.
[00:48:58.197 --> 00:49:02.278]  You do not appease bullies, thugs, terrorists, scum.
[00:49:02.278 --> 00:49:06.920]  We're standing against Obama, and Hillary, and the Islamists, and Mudd, and all of them.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:07.460]  We're done!
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:08.680]  We're done.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.480]  We're on the bridge.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.681]  We're not getting off the bridge.
[00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:11.521]  You want to come?
[00:49:11.521 --> 00:49:12.381]  Come through us.
[00:49:12.381 --> 00:49:13.042]  We're here.
[00:49:13.042 --> 00:49:15.462]  You're going to do it in front of God and country and everybody else.
[00:49:15.462 --> 00:49:16.483]  You want to fight?
[00:49:16.483 --> 00:49:18.103]  Better believe you got one.
[00:49:18.103 --> 00:49:20.184]  And now, what do we do, Paul?
[00:49:20.184 --> 00:49:30.507]  What do we do as they're organizing the coup, pushing it, preparing it, selling it, getting us ready for taking over the government, having new elections, which will never have real elections again.
[00:49:30.507 --> 00:49:31.507]  This is it.
[00:49:31.507 --> 00:49:31.927]  We're winning.
[00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:33.508]  That's why they're this desperate.
[00:49:33.508 --> 00:49:34.488]  What do we do?
[00:49:34.488 --> 00:49:35.409]  What does Trump do?
[00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:36.069]  I mean, Sessions
[00:49:36.849 --> 00:49:38.271]  There should be grand juries.
[00:49:38.271 --> 00:49:41.435]  You can get grand juries all over this country with this information.
[00:49:41.435 --> 00:49:43.978]  To SWAT team all these people for their records.
[00:49:43.978 --> 00:49:45.860]  You know they're all plotting the killing.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.443]  They're so arrogant they're out on TV plotting it!
[00:49:48.443 --> 00:49:50.786]  I want them all arrested now!
[00:49:50.786 --> 00:49:52.347]  I'm tired of this garbage!
[00:49:52.347 --> 00:49:54.810]  They want to kill the president and talk about it on TV?
[00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:55.772]  We are coming for them!
[00:49:58.021 --> 00:50:02.264]  Well, the key is, Alex, where, I mean, the thing that's stopping it is us talking about it.
[00:50:02.264 --> 00:50:02.965]  That's the main thing.
[00:50:02.965 --> 00:50:05.266]  You've had Savage come out and say there's going to be a coup.
[00:50:05.266 --> 00:50:07.208]  You've had Limbaugh come out and say it.
[00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:18.836]  Then you've got people like Chuck Todd on NBC News who reads this memo, you know, for which McMaster fired all these people talking about Islamists and globalists and the fact that they're trying to take America down.
[00:50:18.836 --> 00:50:20.998]  Perfectly logical and sensible.
[00:50:20.998 --> 00:50:24.420]  And he's like, this is such a dark conspiracy theory.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.061]  No wonder they all got fired.
[00:50:26.061 --> 00:50:26.982]  This is bizarre.
[00:50:27.382 --> 00:50:31.447]  You read the memo, it's just Islamists and globalists hate America.
[00:50:31.447 --> 00:50:33.230]  They want America to fail.
[00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:36.033]  Completely makes sense in the course of history.
[00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:39.918]  And you know, modern reason debate for the past 10-15 years.
[00:50:39.918 --> 00:50:42.281]  And they're like, oh my god, this is completely insane.
[00:50:42.281 --> 00:50:44.384]  They are the greatest Judas Iscariot!
[00:50:44.384 --> 00:50:45.085]  They exist!
[00:50:45.766 --> 00:50:47.729]  They're the biggest Benedict Arnold's the world's ever seen.
[00:50:47.729 --> 00:50:50.013]  They are the bad guys of the bad guys.
[00:50:50.013 --> 00:50:56.023]  Blowing up their own golden goose because they're jealous of it and want to pee pee on it to show how big they are.
[00:50:56.023 --> 00:50:57.825]  Stay there Paul, let's talk about the censorship.
[00:50:58.601 --> 00:50:59.502]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:50:59.502 --> 00:51:01.863]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[00:51:01.863 --> 00:51:09.889]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[00:51:09.889 --> 00:51:11.811]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[00:51:11.811 --> 00:51:15.474]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[00:51:30.124 --> 00:51:30.844]  Anywhere.
[00:51:30.844 --> 00:51:33.945]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[00:51:33.945 --> 00:51:34.506]  At home.
[00:51:34.506 --> 00:51:35.146]  At work.
[00:51:35.146 --> 00:51:35.966]  In the car.
[00:51:35.966 --> 00:51:37.727]  On smartphones.
[00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:40.668]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[00:51:40.668 --> 00:51:46.290]  That makes choosing radio as a place to advertise your business one of the best decisions you can make.

[00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:58.811]  I ordered some Andro 400.
[00:52:58.811 --> 00:53:01.734]  I'm losing weight, too, around the belly really quickly.
[00:53:01.734 --> 00:53:04.696]  Some of the pants that didn't fit me, now they're falling off my hips.
[00:53:04.696 --> 00:53:07.819]  There's been a noticeable increase in energy.
[00:53:07.819 --> 00:53:08.860]  Then this stuff works.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:09.540]  It does work.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:13.244]  That's what Bill said after taking Andro 400 for a month.
[00:53:13.244 --> 00:53:15.545]  Now listen to what Richard says about Andro 400.
[00:53:16.366 --> 00:53:21.968]  I did a lot of research on it before I ordered it because I've tried other products in the past and they haven't worked.
[00:53:21.968 --> 00:53:24.970]  But I could not believe the difference literally within a month.
[00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:28.011]  Since I started taking it I have lost 37 pounds.
[00:53:28.011 --> 00:53:28.971]  It was the belly fat.
[00:53:28.971 --> 00:53:31.192]  I could get weight off but I could never get the tummy off.
[00:53:31.192 --> 00:53:35.134]  Now the tummy's coming off and I have more energy than I've had in 20 years.
[00:53:35.134 --> 00:53:35.474]  Guys.
[00:53:35.814 --> 00:53:42.720]  If you too want to lose belly fat, gain energy, and feel 20 years younger like Richard, try Andro 400.

[00:53:48.085 --> 00:53:48.345]  That's 888-400-0435.
[00:54:06.269 --> 00:54:09.092]  Now listen up, folks!
[00:54:09.092 --> 00:54:11.795]  People wanna claim they're gonna fight for America.
[00:54:11.795 --> 00:54:22.728]  All you gotta do here is get the word out, say your prayers, support the broadcast, and let everybody in your community, your family, your church understand how serious this is.
[00:54:22.728 --> 00:54:24.130]  And we've broken through.
[00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:25.812]  Sean Hannity's talking about it, Limbaugh.
[00:54:27.642 --> 00:54:31.143]  Levin, Drudge, it's all out there.
[00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:31.923]  It's real.
[00:54:31.923 --> 00:54:36.063]  And it takes a lot to get folks to say, hey, there's a plan to kill the president, and these people are criminals.
[00:54:36.063 --> 00:54:38.404]  Because it sounds crazy, but they're doing it!
[00:54:38.404 --> 00:54:40.484]  And see, it's my job to say the things first.
[00:54:40.484 --> 00:54:46.725]  I know we're going on, like I've been doing for eight months, show we had them off at the pass.
[00:54:46.725 --> 00:54:51.506]  So they've gone from doing it covertly, till we forced them out overtly, which was my plan.
[00:54:51.506 --> 00:54:53.527]  And I told them my plan.
[00:54:53.527 --> 00:54:55.647]  So, that's where we are right now.
[00:54:57.005 --> 00:54:59.206]  We're only able to do this because we have you, the audience.
[00:54:59.206 --> 00:55:00.567]  It's not that I'm that smart.
[00:55:00.567 --> 00:55:01.047]  It's you.
[00:55:01.047 --> 00:55:03.208]  I haven't even plugged this hour.
[00:55:03.208 --> 00:55:04.649]  I need financial support.
[00:55:04.649 --> 00:55:08.711]  We are running two big specials, the 1776 special and the old special.
[00:55:08.711 --> 00:55:12.873]  I'm now calling the BuzzFeed special because we're talking 55% off, you name it.
[00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:20.051]  Because this BuzzFeed thing is the Holy Grail of ridiculous.
[00:55:20.051 --> 00:55:28.035]  And wait till what we discovered in the next hour, their big disinfo piece, where they admit, well, these products are totally clean and they're as advertised.
[00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:30.436]  Do you understand why they had them tested in California?
[00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:34.918]  Because that's where they have Prop 65, where there's more lead in the air.
[00:55:34.918 --> 00:55:37.839]  You have to label it for Prop 65 or you could be sued.
[00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:41.221]  It was passed by lawyers to be able to sue companies, not just supplements,
[00:55:42.423 --> 00:55:47.584]  To have levels that are impossible to not have in most products.
[00:55:47.584 --> 00:55:50.485]  But we are California level.
[00:55:50.485 --> 00:55:54.305]  We still do it, even though it's a huge hassle and almost impossible, we're able to do it.
[00:55:54.305 --> 00:55:57.746]  They sent it to California, did the testing, and didn't find it.
[00:55:57.746 --> 00:55:59.646]  And they're so upset right now.
[00:55:59.646 --> 00:56:01.907]  And it made sales explode!
[00:56:01.907 --> 00:56:05.688]  People are like, wow, this big lab did this and it's totally clean?
[00:56:05.688 --> 00:56:07.668]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:56:08.703 --> 00:56:14.168]  We have seen sales go up 40% the last three days, two and a half days.
[00:56:14.168 --> 00:56:15.929]  Anyways, Paul Watson, I appreciate you coming on.
[00:56:15.929 --> 00:56:18.952]  You're about to go on a well-deserved holiday.
[00:56:18.952 --> 00:56:20.814]  But also, let's now talk about...
[00:56:21.687 --> 00:56:26.709]  The censorship on YouTube and why we're doing this, because I agree with Diamonds and Lace and others and what you're doing.
[00:56:26.709 --> 00:56:34.213]  We've got to go ahead and pull ourselves off YouTube to illustrate that they want to incrementally shut down free speech.
[00:56:34.213 --> 00:56:48.299]  We have to do this, I think, as a protest to show that it's no longer a platform that can be trusted to make them reform or to get President Trump to move with antitrust action, because they are operating in a discriminatory way towards anybody who's not basically aligned with
[00:56:49.219 --> 00:56:55.426]  Eugenics-based, hyper-modern neoliberalism with a smattering of Maoist ideology.
[00:56:55.426 --> 00:56:59.190]  I mean, they're just banning everything now, and it's beyond Chinese level.
[00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:00.912]  I mean, they're banning stuff China doesn't ban.
[00:57:00.912 --> 00:57:02.234]  This is next level.
[00:57:02.234 --> 00:57:05.638]  So tell folks about your video that's gone viral where you say you're done.
[00:57:07.583 --> 00:57:12.866]  I'm done with you two until they change their policies or until they signal that they're going to change them, Alex.
[00:57:12.866 --> 00:57:16.167]  I mean, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher came out with a quote last night.
[00:57:16.167 --> 00:57:21.690]  The mistreatment of Conservatives and Libertarians by tech monopolies is a civil rights issue.
[00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:23.311]  And that's what it comes down to.
[00:57:23.311 --> 00:57:24.712]  It's Google and Facebook.
[00:57:24.712 --> 00:57:25.892]  Those are the big two.
[00:57:25.892 --> 00:57:28.574]  OK, I was banned by Facebook yesterday.
[00:57:28.574 --> 00:57:29.234]  Get this, Alex.
[00:57:29.734 --> 00:57:49.385]  For posting a picture of a famous ginger YouTuber who made a parody joke video about feminism 18 months ago, who was in on the joke, and because I posted a picture of it, again, 18 months ago, which obviously offended some feminists, they banned me on Facebook.
[00:57:49.385 --> 00:57:54.768]  So literally Facebook is now being run by the same people who screamed bloody murder at it.
[00:57:54.768 --> 00:57:55.589]  And let's explain something.
[00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:58.851]  You're a public figure attacked in newspapers and TV every day, so am I.
[00:57:59.924 --> 00:58:01.945]  If we don't have speech, no one is.
[00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:05.026]  They want to destroy us with straw men, not let us respond.
[00:58:05.026 --> 00:58:05.927]  And let's explain.
[00:58:05.927 --> 00:58:11.089]  You had Facebook videos, Paul, with 30 million views, some of them, each.
[00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:12.790]  I mean, bigger than CNN.
[00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:13.890]  That's why they took you down.
[00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:18.793]  That's why they're trying to ban PewDiePie, because they don't want anybody they don't control with a voice.
[00:58:18.793 --> 00:58:23.495]  Yes, folks, Paul had close to a billion views on his personal Facebook page.
[00:58:24.235 --> 00:58:30.900]  We have billions and billions on ours as well, and they annihilated it for Copper Cap, who I know is a listener and friends with Paul.
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:37.024]  I mean, you know, for having fun videos about patriarchy rules the world.
[00:58:37.024 --> 00:58:38.505]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:38.505 --> 00:58:39.405]  This is incredible.
[00:58:39.405 --> 00:58:43.028]  They're moving against us, but ah!
[00:58:43.028 --> 00:58:43.768]  We're fighting back.
[00:58:43.768 --> 00:58:45.229]  It's a civil rights violation.
[00:58:45.229 --> 00:58:47.171]  You are organized and racketeering against us.
[00:58:49.045 --> 00:58:54.067]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:58:54.067 --> 00:59:07.032]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:59:07.032 --> 00:59:13.594]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:59:13.594 --> 00:59:16.055]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:59:16.155 --> 00:59:16.375]  I think?
[00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:40.173]  Support Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[00:59:40.173 --> 00:59:54.685]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free triple-a two five three three one three nine You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:15.872]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.872 --> 01:00:21.113]  Alright, we've got five minutes, Paul.
[01:00:21.113 --> 01:00:30.995]  Give people a briefing on the massive intensification of censorship worldwide, web, by Facebook, Google, Twitter, all the big ones.
[01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:33.776]  Yeah, I can stay after the break a bit longer if necessary, but
[01:00:34.446 --> 01:00:38.048]  As you said, Google and Facebook are basically monopolies at this point.
[01:00:38.048 --> 01:00:40.290]  They're acting like public utilities.
[01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:49.135]  You'll notice, Alex, that back in the day, Zuckerberg, Schmidt, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, they used to talk about themselves as public utilities.
[01:00:49.135 --> 01:00:55.719]  In fact, there's a quote here, which I've got from Time, where Zuckerberg is talking about Facebook as a public utility.
[01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:57.100]  So they acted like that.
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.601]  They consolidated.
[01:00:58.601 --> 01:01:00.002]  Now they've become monopolies.
[01:01:00.522 --> 01:01:03.144]  They need to be treated as public utilities.
[01:01:03.144 --> 01:01:08.026]  This is what Steve Bannon came out and advocated two weeks ago.
[01:01:08.026 --> 01:01:09.467]  Okay?
[01:01:09.467 --> 01:01:14.150]  If I want running water in my house, Alex, I can only pay one company.
[01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.311]  Now, it's still a private company, but it's a monopoly.
[01:01:17.311 --> 01:01:18.552]  I don't have a choice.
[01:01:18.552 --> 01:01:21.874]  Now, at this point, Google and YouTube are complete monopolies.
[01:01:21.874 --> 01:01:27.437]  YouTube does not have a competitor, a serious competitor, as a video platform.
[01:01:27.798 --> 01:01:30.605]  Listen to this quote out of the Guardian article, Alex.
[01:01:30.605 --> 01:01:32.129]  Hardly a right-wing publication.
[01:01:32.859 --> 01:01:34.320]  About Google and Facebook.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.504]  They have become the medium through which we experience and understand the world.
[01:01:39.504 --> 01:01:39.824]  Okay?
[01:01:39.824 --> 01:01:41.645]  They're the new public commons.
[01:01:41.645 --> 01:01:44.727]  Google and Facebook are more powerful than most countries.
[01:01:44.727 --> 01:01:47.109]  They're bigger than any media outlet.
[01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:52.613]  They need to be regulated if they deny people service based on their political beliefs.
[01:01:52.613 --> 01:01:57.136]  It's actually illegal to do that in the United Kingdom under the Equality Act.
[01:01:57.136 --> 01:02:01.919]  You can't deny someone a service because they have a certain belief or if they don't have it.
[01:02:02.339 --> 01:02:09.628]  We also have these companies aligning with the state, with the government, to persecute people for their free speech.
[01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:10.629]  And let's read this again.
[01:02:10.629 --> 01:02:11.690]  Put that headline back up.
[01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:12.411]  That's so powerful.
[01:02:12.411 --> 01:02:13.953]  From the Liberal Guardian.
[01:02:13.953 --> 01:02:21.842]  That Facebook and Google are the most powerful and secretive empires ever known in world history.
[01:02:22.881 --> 01:02:34.869]  They're spying on everything and they're putting armies of SJWs in, banning people that criticize Nazis now, saying just showing Hitler is hurtful.
[01:02:34.869 --> 01:02:39.612]  This is beyond Soviet level or Chinese internet censorship.
[01:02:39.612 --> 01:02:42.774]  These people are flaming authoritarians.
[01:02:44.033 --> 01:02:46.634]  And they've teamed up with the state, with government.
[01:02:46.634 --> 01:02:53.016]  Police are now visiting people at home in this country right now for posting things critical of Islam on Facebook.
[01:02:53.016 --> 01:02:55.217]  I tweeted a story about that earlier today.
[01:02:55.217 --> 01:02:59.598]  They have police officers who are also deranged social justice warriors
[01:03:00.198 --> 01:03:08.802]  Using and abusing their power to direct supermarkets to change the language on their feminine product shelf because it might offend people.
[01:03:08.802 --> 01:03:10.863]  This has gone totally out of control.
[01:03:10.863 --> 01:03:18.326]  They've aligned with the state, they've formed themselves into monopolies, and they're basically deranged thought police now in power.
[01:03:18.326 --> 01:03:21.447]  I mean, it came out, Alex, as a result of the James Damore thing.
[01:03:21.447 --> 01:03:26.549]  People looked into the Twitter profiles of the people running Google's diversity department.
[01:03:26.989 --> 01:03:31.912]  It was people literally advocating violence against others for disagreeing with them.
[01:03:31.912 --> 01:03:38.677]  It was the usual cast of blue-haired lesbian feminists talking about how obsessed they are about pronouns.
[01:03:38.677 --> 01:03:43.000]  You know, this literally looked like the guest list for Trigglypuff's Slumber Party.
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.901]  These are the thought police.
[01:03:44.901 --> 01:03:46.121]  They're now in power.
[01:03:46.121 --> 01:03:47.682]  They only care about power.
[01:03:47.682 --> 01:03:50.883]  They only care about crushing your First Amendment rights.
[01:03:50.883 --> 01:03:54.284]  Now they've formed into monopolies and now it's happening.
[01:03:54.284 --> 01:03:58.106]  This is why Diamond and Silk are talking about a class action lawsuit.
[01:03:58.106 --> 01:04:04.328]  This is why prominent YouTubers, prominent social media and free speech advocates need to get behind this.
[01:04:04.328 --> 01:04:07.710]  Because as the Congressman said, this is a civil rights issue.
[01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.350]  Something needs to change now.
[01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:10.451]  It's gone too far.
[01:04:12.017 --> 01:04:15.039]  Look at the people that are running the censorship boards.
[01:04:15.039 --> 01:04:19.322]  I mean, they're just looking for power.
[01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.503]  Do they not understand how dishonorable they are?
[01:04:23.132 --> 01:04:30.696]  One of those profiles literally says punch Nazis, which of course a Nazi is anyone who disagrees with a far-left social justice warrior.
[01:04:30.696 --> 01:04:33.737]  These are the people literally running Google right now.
[01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:37.859]  So is it any surprise, Alex, that now insiders have come out and confirmed what we knew?
[01:04:37.859 --> 01:04:43.502]  They're censoring search results to hide politically incorrect information.
[01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:45.083]  Now we've got confirmation of that as well.
[01:04:45.663 --> 01:04:53.361]  And you're saying you're leaving YouTube to make a point, to have a clean break to show it no longer has any semblance of freedom.
[01:04:53.361 --> 01:04:53.681]  Stay there.
[01:04:55.839 --> 01:04:57.240]  Why is the fungus?
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.321]  Why is the mold?
[01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:00.062]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:00.882]  What is going on?
[01:05:00.882 --> 01:05:01.783]  What has changed?
[01:05:26.099 --> 01:05:27.520]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.501]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:30.962]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:05:30.962 --> 01:05:35.484]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[01:05:35.484 --> 01:05:36.204]  Get it today.
[01:05:36.204 --> 01:05:36.784]  Limited run.
[01:05:36.784 --> 01:05:38.205]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:05:38.205 --> 01:05:42.847]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:46.209]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:48.530]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:50.431]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:05:50.431 --> 01:05:51.892]  We're changing the world together.
[01:05:51.892 --> 01:05:52.892]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:05:52.892 --> 01:05:53.653]  God bless you all.
[01:05:56.835 --> 01:06:00.618]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:06:00.618 --> 01:06:08.343]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:16.989]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:06:16.989 --> 01:06:21.371]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:26.535]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:06:26.975 --> 01:06:28.095]  We're good to go.
[01:06:55.425 --> 01:07:04.514]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:04.514 --> 01:07:12.602]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:12.902 --> 01:07:17.765]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:17.765 --> 01:07:24.588]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:24.588 --> 01:07:31.752]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:31.752 --> 01:07:38.615]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:38.775 --> 01:07:43.239]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:43.239 --> 01:07:46.641]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:46.641 --> 01:07:52.946]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:52.946 --> 01:07:54.648]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:06.787 --> 01:08:16.014]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.014 --> 01:08:17.755]  Yeah, Paul Watson!
[01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:36.708]  Over a billion views on his two Facebook channels for videos he personally did for InfoWars.
[01:08:36.708 --> 01:08:40.809]  I mean, that's success.
[01:08:40.809 --> 01:08:42.249]  They erased his Facebook.
[01:08:42.249 --> 01:08:43.550]  Just took it away, got rid of it.
[01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:44.850]  And they'd already been disappearing.
[01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:48.631]  I'd be like, wow, there were a lot of videos that had 14 million, 20 million, 35 million.
[01:08:48.631 --> 01:08:52.052]  And those just keep getting bigger as people go, wow, this got 35 million views.
[01:08:52.052 --> 01:08:53.532]  I need to go watch this.
[01:08:53.532 --> 01:08:54.172]  Nope.
[01:08:54.172 --> 01:08:56.632]  They just deleted his whole account now.
[01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:58.613]  And they're moving on to everybody else.
[01:09:00.131 --> 01:09:04.346]  And they've told PewDiePie, who's never been political, they just don't like the fact that he's got...
[01:09:06.155 --> 01:09:08.897]  What is it, 18 billion views just on YouTube?
[01:09:08.897 --> 01:09:13.141]  They don't like that he's more popular times 50 than MTV.
[01:09:13.141 --> 01:09:16.164]  And the executives came and said, work with us.
[01:09:16.164 --> 01:09:17.224]  Let us run your operation.
[01:09:17.224 --> 01:09:18.085]  We won't shut you off.
[01:09:18.085 --> 01:09:18.766]  And he said, no way.
[01:09:18.766 --> 01:09:21.008]  And so they're going to start kicking him off as well.
[01:09:21.008 --> 01:09:26.212]  They're not going to quit, even if you only show cat videos.
[01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:30.436]  If you've got 50 billion views of cats, they're going to take your channel.
[01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:51.924]  This is racketeering and as Congress is now investigating and saying it's a civil rights violation because you're conservative or libertarian to claim you have a monetization program and then politically let people go in and demonetize stuff to hurt you while Google is still running ads on the page.
[01:09:51.924 --> 01:09:56.147]  That's literal electronic ghettos as Matt Drudge coined the term.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:02.022]  Years ago, talking about what Facebook, Twitter, and Google are.
[01:10:02.022 --> 01:10:06.364]  And saying, if you stay there and don't build an alternative, they will turn it into that.
[01:10:06.364 --> 01:10:07.464]  And now they've done it.
[01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:09.445]  And we've tried to build InfoWars.
[01:10:09.445 --> 01:10:13.367]  And that's why we had this plan months ago.
[01:10:13.367 --> 01:10:15.508]  But we are going to launch it today.
[01:10:15.508 --> 01:10:18.769]  It just so happens that today it was ready.
[01:10:18.769 --> 01:10:22.090]  And this is the day we had it planned for weeks.
[01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:24.551]  We are launching a new site.
[01:10:24.551 --> 01:10:25.732]  I haven't even told the crew this yet.
[01:10:26.932 --> 01:10:30.656]  Newswars.com.
[01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:34.179]  Now we launched InfoWars in 1997.
[01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:38.143]  I was on air two years before that.
[01:10:38.143 --> 01:10:43.368]  But in the modern world, this is the news war.
[01:10:43.368 --> 01:10:47.912]  And it's a fight between those that tell the truth and those that lie.
[01:10:47.912 --> 01:10:51.296]  And the site has a very nice, good, clean look.
[01:10:52.523 --> 01:10:55.244]  Very modern look, works really well on your mobiles.
[01:10:55.244 --> 01:10:57.805]  And I want to ask everybody to help share NewsWars.
[01:10:57.805 --> 01:11:04.428]  Plus, when they're trying to hack and bring down InfoWars or Prison Planet, it's on separate servers and systems as well.
[01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:09.391]  So, it is a new site, and I would like to get NewsWars out to everybody today.
[01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:11.892]  They'll get Paul Watson's article there.
[01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:13.052]  CNN analyst on Trump.
[01:11:13.052 --> 01:11:15.893]  The government's going to kill this guy.
[01:11:15.893 --> 01:11:18.355]  And I hope everybody will go to NewsWars.
[01:11:18.355 --> 01:11:21.216]  Now, they're also not just trying to censor us and shut us up.
[01:11:22.807 --> 01:11:24.228]  I want Paul to finish talking about this.
[01:11:24.228 --> 01:11:28.772]  They're also going after our funding.
[01:11:28.772 --> 01:11:31.174]  AdRoll, not the good company AdBlade.
[01:11:31.174 --> 01:11:33.296]  AdRoll works with Google.
[01:11:33.296 --> 01:11:35.057]  We were going to bring in $5 million this year.
[01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:35.718]  Sounds like a lot.
[01:11:36.596 --> 01:11:42.641]  But that's five million gross, and the products cost things, so let's say two and a half million of money to hire new people and expand.
[01:11:42.641 --> 01:11:53.931]  They took it away, and now credit card companies, you name it, are saying, oh, you're Alex Jones, you're conservative, you can't, and lawyers tell me, we're going to win these lawsuits, I just don't know who to sue first.
[01:11:53.931 --> 01:12:02.459]  And see, Diamond and Silk's starting, Congress is having investigations, lawyers are saying, look, this is a civil rights violation, cut and dry, we're just wanting to pick the right case.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.963]  So, a word to the wise is sufficient.
[01:12:08.963 --> 01:12:28.078]  They also then get lawyer groups together, and they direct all this, and they send all of our nutraceuticals to a California lab that tests for the big law firms, so they can say it violates Prop 65, if you have detectable levels of anything, basically, in your products, they have to be totally clean, or they can sue you in California.
[01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:31.421]  Well, they tested it, and they said, okay, it's California level.
[01:12:33.677 --> 01:12:38.941]  What, you don't think we don't already have our stuff tested in California labs?
[01:12:38.941 --> 01:12:40.423]  But they really screwed up, folks.
[01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:42.064]  They really screwed up bad.
[01:12:42.064 --> 01:12:46.427]  We caught them in something that is so incredible that I could spend three hours on it.
[01:12:46.427 --> 01:12:48.890]  Wait until I get to this.
[01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:53.093]  I don't know when, but later in the show, we caught them.
[01:12:53.093 --> 01:12:58.938]  This is, this is staggering.
[01:12:58.938 --> 01:13:02.000]  This is staggering.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.701]  What we discovered.
[01:13:06.994 --> 01:13:17.863]  It's like today, when they're on CNN saying, we've got a plan, we're about to kill the president, we're gonna kill the president, and it's a CIA black op bureaucrat who directs the black op groups.
[01:13:17.863 --> 01:13:24.128]  I mean, it's just like, how do you even go on air and have a headline fantastic enough for all this?
[01:13:24.128 --> 01:13:32.175]  And then what we caught them in is so crazy, and so red-handed, and so diabolical,
[01:13:36.124 --> 01:13:38.346]  And we've got some good brains here.
[01:13:38.346 --> 01:13:42.910]  And we've said, we hope, because we know at least 10 orders have gone out to media companies.
[01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:48.956]  We know at least five labs have tested it and found, of course, it's totally clean and as advertised.
[01:13:48.956 --> 01:13:51.718]  And then they lie and they say, but there's no value.
[01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:52.779]  These products are no good.
[01:13:52.779 --> 01:13:53.720]  You don't need this.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.401]  We caught them.
[01:13:55.785 --> 01:14:03.351]  With the very stuff we private-labeled, the main best-selling stuff at Whole Foods, we just go get the cleanest, best, top-of-the-line that is affordable.
[01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:22.186]  There's always super top-of-the-line that's like really expensive, but you know, we have the lab endorsing and saying what great values are the exact products for double what we sell them when we private-labeled the exact product that they say is wonderful and good and as advertised
[01:14:23.055 --> 01:14:30.081]  Because liberal firms go to them and then do the test and then there's the glowing review or whatever.
[01:14:30.081 --> 01:14:31.522]  But we have them!
[01:14:31.522 --> 01:14:37.266]  And we don't just have it with one of the products!
[01:14:37.266 --> 01:14:40.449]  You realize how big that is, folks?
[01:14:40.449 --> 01:14:43.231]  It's incredible.
[01:14:43.231 --> 01:14:51.617]  We have the same product for half the price, bought from that very company,
[01:14:52.555 --> 01:15:03.882]  Across the United States recognized as the number one vitamin B12 organically derived with the highest level bioavailability and the cleanest.
[01:15:03.882 --> 01:15:05.543]  Medical grade basically.
[01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:07.304]  But you don't supposedly say that.
[01:15:07.304 --> 01:15:10.425]  It's the same stuff pharmaceutical companies get and people inject.
[01:15:10.425 --> 01:15:11.526]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:15:11.526 --> 01:15:14.008]  But we went and got the best.
[01:15:14.008 --> 01:15:17.410]  The very same lad has it up there as God.
[01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:18.810]  The best.
[01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:19.351]  The cleanest.
[01:15:20.419 --> 01:15:28.405]  Says ours is doesn't do anything for you and is way overpriced when ours is the exact same one and half the price.
[01:15:28.405 --> 01:15:31.587]  That is a royal flush smack down.
[01:15:31.587 --> 01:15:34.449]  We're going to put videos together, show it side by side.
[01:15:34.449 --> 01:15:37.711]  And there was one other product too.
[01:15:37.711 --> 01:15:39.132]  Wait till we get to that.
[01:15:39.132 --> 01:15:40.173]  That's right.
[01:15:40.173 --> 01:15:46.978]  This B12 is so good that we have to pay a lot for it and we don't make much, but I wanted you to have the best.
[01:15:48.892 --> 01:15:51.853]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper if God's with us.
[01:15:51.853 --> 01:15:53.674]  Paul, my friend, I salute you for everything you've done.
[01:15:53.674 --> 01:16:05.699]  You've got the floor to finish up with the attacks, the censorship, why you're doing this, trying to get other people obviously to join in this, to get media to cover your video where you show all the proof of the monopoly and the activity.
[01:16:05.699 --> 01:16:11.142]  I mean, if we go quietly into these electronic gulags and don't scream and don't make an issue out of it, I guess we deserve what happens to us, Paul.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.181]  No, exactly.
[01:16:13.181 --> 01:16:20.730]  I mean, to put it in perspective, it would be like if I... You know, ICANN can't just delete InfoWars.com because they don't like what we post.
[01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:22.752]  If they did, there'd be a massive lawsuit.
[01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:30.582]  You know, British Telecom, my internet service provider, can't cut off my internet service because they don't like what websites I visit.
[01:16:30.942 --> 01:16:32.963]  You know, unless it's completely illegal.
[01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:34.703]  They're a private company.
[01:16:34.703 --> 01:16:36.244]  Where's the argument there?
[01:16:36.244 --> 01:16:42.446]  Again, with YouTube, you've had them literally censor Mark Dice videos for criticizing CNN.
[01:16:42.446 --> 01:16:45.386]  You've had them delete Jordan Peterson's entire channel.
[01:16:45.386 --> 01:16:53.189]  And the point is, Alex, we have to bitch about it every single time simply to try and get back some sense of equilibrium.
[01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:55.169]  I mean, that's the other aspect of this.
[01:16:55.169 --> 01:17:00.631]  They prevent us from pushing our narrative because we constantly have to bitch about how they're censoring us every day.
[01:17:00.971 --> 01:17:02.152]  I don't want to talk about this.
[01:17:02.152 --> 01:17:08.237]  I mean, it's quite boring at the end of the day, but we need to talk about it because people aren't treating it seriously enough.
[01:17:08.237 --> 01:17:16.304]  So now, Alex, you've got Uber cancelling people's rides because they don't like them commenting about Islam in the course of a conversation.
[01:17:16.304 --> 01:17:21.068]  You've got Airbnb refusing service for people because of their political beliefs.
[01:17:21.568 --> 01:17:30.474]  Oh, but if you refuse to bake a gay wedding cake, the full force of the government and the outraged witch-hunt mob will come crashing down on you.
[01:17:30.474 --> 01:17:32.336]  So there's that double standard.
[01:17:32.336 --> 01:17:39.601]  And just the fact that they want to be treated as a utility, they've said it, Zuckerberg said it, Schmitt said it, Jack Dorsey said it, okay.
[01:17:40.141 --> 01:17:41.463]  Let's treat them like that.
[01:17:41.463 --> 01:17:42.885]  You know, I'm not an anarchist.
[01:17:42.885 --> 01:17:49.273]  I think there should be some small level of government regulation, especially with monopolies like Google and Facebook.
[01:17:49.273 --> 01:17:50.615]  So let's bring it on.
[01:17:50.615 --> 01:17:54.540]  I think these class action lawsuits that people are talking about will be the beginning of that.
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.663]  And that's the final point we haven't added.
[01:17:57.344 --> 01:17:58.465]  But you make it in your video.
[01:17:58.465 --> 01:18:18.633]  Zuckerberg believes he's a god, wants to be president, wants to use his giant Facebook community, bigger than any country, as the Associated Press and others have pointed out, with its power and the number of people it has organized, while shutting down little people comparatively, like you and I. So, he wants to be president?
[01:18:19.033 --> 01:18:28.636]  And then he wants to use his media operation to become president when you're not even supposed to have a media operation when you're running for office because it's a conflict of interest under their campaign finance laws.
[01:18:28.636 --> 01:18:36.458]  And then under campaign finance laws, they want drudge and InfoWars shutdown, claiming that we're involved in violations of campaign finance law.
[01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.039]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[01:18:39.659 --> 01:18:49.350]  Yeah, and remember they had to apologise and reverse that trending list scandal last year where they admitted it wasn't organic, they were cultivating it for a leftist bias.
[01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:56.057]  Now both times on Facebook I was banned, and by the way it's like three strikes and you're out, so the next one I'll be out for good.
[01:18:56.597 --> 01:19:00.899]  Both of those times were me making a joke about feminism.
[01:19:00.899 --> 01:19:04.041]  That's literally how low the bar is now on Facebook.
[01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:09.383]  In one of them, I actually complimented a woman's appearance in the course of making a joke about feminism.
[01:19:09.383 --> 01:19:10.223]  That's not allowed.
[01:19:10.223 --> 01:19:11.064]  I was suspended.
[01:19:11.064 --> 01:19:12.684]  So one more strike and I'm out.
[01:19:12.684 --> 01:19:16.046]  Then they have these diversity meetings, which came out the James Damore thing.
[01:19:16.466 --> 01:19:19.627]  Alex, they're literally like North Korean cult brainwashing.
[01:19:19.627 --> 01:19:30.809]  They make the employees attend their meetings to prove their loyalty to the cultish dogma of diversity, which is completely mentally deranged, as James Damore has exposed.
[01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:31.669]  This is crucial.
[01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:32.809]  People need to get on it.
[01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:34.610]  Support the march against Google.
[01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:38.951]  Support people within Google who support us, who are now leaking information.
[01:19:38.951 --> 01:19:40.571]  Those two steps are crucial, Alex.
[01:19:40.771 --> 01:19:43.413]  And by the way, Cernovich is behind that big march against Googles.
[01:19:43.413 --> 01:19:45.094]  He's going to be hosting in the fourth hour.
[01:19:45.094 --> 01:19:46.775]  I hope to be involved in that as well.
[01:19:46.775 --> 01:19:48.236]  Paul, thank you so much, my friend.
[01:19:48.236 --> 01:19:50.438]  This evil system is destined to fail.
[01:19:50.438 --> 01:19:53.380]  The question is, how hellish will it get before it does fall?
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:54.961]  We'll be back with the latest on North Korea.
[01:19:54.961 --> 01:19:57.323]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:58.604]  Get back to nature.

[01:20:31.165 --> 01:20:32.245]  Forget bunkers.
[01:20:32.245 --> 01:20:34.066]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:20:34.066 --> 01:20:35.787]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:20:54.426 --> 01:20:58.891]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:00.493]  Those times may be near.
[01:21:00.493 --> 01:21:01.394]  Think about it.
[01:21:01.394 --> 01:21:05.999]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:10.645]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:21:10.985 --> 01:21:16.787]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:21:16.787 --> 01:21:23.490]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:26.051]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:21:26.491 --> 01:21:29.292]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.801]  I ordered some Andro 400.
[01:22:54.801 --> 01:22:57.723]  I'm losing weight, too, around the belly really quickly.
[01:22:57.723 --> 01:23:00.665]  Some of the pants that didn't fit me, now they're falling off my hips.
[01:23:00.665 --> 01:23:03.807]  There's been a noticeable increase in energy.
[01:23:03.807 --> 01:23:04.848]  Then this stuff works.
[01:23:04.848 --> 01:23:05.528]  It does work.
[01:23:05.528 --> 01:23:09.231]  That's what Bill said after taking Andro 400 for a month.
[01:23:09.231 --> 01:23:11.513]  Now listen to what Richard says about Andro 400.
[01:23:12.353 --> 01:23:17.955]  I did a lot of research on it before I ordered it because I've tried other products in the past and they haven't worked.
[01:23:17.955 --> 01:23:20.957]  But I could not believe the difference literally within a month.
[01:23:20.957 --> 01:23:23.998]  Since I started taking it I have lost 37 pounds.
[01:23:23.998 --> 01:23:24.958]  It was the belly fat.
[01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:27.179]  I could get weight off but I could never get the tummy off.
[01:23:27.179 --> 01:23:31.121]  Now the tummy's coming off and I have more energy than I've had in 20 years.
[01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:31.481]  Guys.
[01:23:31.801 --> 01:23:38.183]  If you too want to lose belly fat, gain energy, and feel 20 years younger like Richard, try Andro 400.

[01:24:15.959 --> 01:24:19.280]  Joel Skousen is our guest for the next 40 minutes or so.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:27.083]  He's a former Marine Corps naval aviator from the Vietnam era, a patriot, author, researcher, and the editor of World Affairs Brief.
[01:24:27.083 --> 01:24:32.065]  His family's been fighting the globalists for a good 65, 70 years.
[01:24:32.065 --> 01:24:35.066]  Cleon Skousen, obviously his uncle.
[01:24:35.066 --> 01:24:41.529]  I got him on about North Korea because he is a noted expert on North Korea, has been predicting it'd be the big trigger point getting into all that.
[01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:44.443]  But we'll do that in the next segment.
[01:24:44.443 --> 01:24:46.544]  I wanted to bring this up to him.
[01:24:46.544 --> 01:24:50.446]  We have not just Clapper and Brennan talking about the coup coming against the president.
[01:24:50.446 --> 01:24:53.307]  I won't list it all again.
[01:24:53.307 --> 01:25:02.771]  We have the torture bureaucrat for these whole illegal operations.
[01:25:02.771 --> 01:25:03.931]  I mean, he's in the lawsuits.
[01:25:03.931 --> 01:25:05.372]  It's in the criminal cases.
[01:25:05.372 --> 01:25:08.033]  His underlings are indicted.
[01:25:08.033 --> 01:25:08.773]  Philip Mudd.
[01:25:10.752 --> 01:25:14.154]  And he's created by the Clintons, brought in.
[01:25:14.154 --> 01:25:15.615]  I spent an hour looking into him this morning.
[01:25:15.615 --> 01:25:16.696]  I knew he was before.
[01:25:16.696 --> 01:25:18.577]  He's that bad.
[01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:24.780]  And Mueller put him in to take over the FBI under Obama six, seven years ago.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:29.643]  So they created the CIA office in the FBI to watch the FBI.
[01:25:29.643 --> 01:25:32.985]  So this is, I mean, this guy's really bad news.
[01:25:32.985 --> 01:25:39.109]  And he just basically said, hey, the president's, you know, hurting our government and the CIA, quote, the government's going to kill this guy.
[01:25:42.435 --> 01:25:44.496]  Now you tie that into all the other stuff that's going on.
[01:25:44.496 --> 01:25:48.437]  I want to ask Joe Skoutsen what he thinks is going on here.
[01:25:48.437 --> 01:25:56.020]  Because the same guy said a few weeks ago that he wants to go physically assault Gowdy and he needs to be beaten up.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.661]  So this guy, I looked into him, he doesn't do the torturing and the killing himself.
[01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:04.983]  They use the army for that and contractors and people.
[01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:12.265]  The left's so out of control, they created some leftist units of psychiatrists torturing people, but they always tattled about it and had their own deal.
[01:26:12.265 --> 01:26:14.306]  So those are the ones going to jail, of course.
[01:26:14.306 --> 01:26:16.788]  But it's just crazy, the stuff that's happening.
[01:26:16.788 --> 01:26:26.575]  So, Joel Skousen, what do you think, as a former military officer, as an analyst, with all your contacts, this guy's particularly nasty, and I believe it's scripted when he said this on air.
[01:26:26.575 --> 01:26:35.821]  What do you think this is signaling, or what's behind just a crescendo of, we're gonna remove him in the next few months, Republicans need to bipartisanly get behind it, it's gonna be sudden,
[01:26:40.482 --> 01:26:53.624]  You know, I think that he's really off the reservation rather than being a spokesman for the globalists.
[01:26:53.624 --> 01:27:00.145]  They're really much more savvy about these things and careful than to make those kind of statements in public.
[01:27:00.145 --> 01:27:03.646]  Clearly, you know, he's part of the deep state and he's
[01:27:04.707 --> 01:27:09.513]  Probably overly enthused about his new abilities to be out front.
[01:27:09.513 --> 01:27:20.047]  But, you know, the establishment is very, very careful about going to the assassination mode because they build a cadre of conspiracy believers every time they pull off one of these things.
[01:27:20.567 --> 01:27:23.988]  I mean, JFK convinced a lot of people it was a conspiracy.
[01:27:23.988 --> 01:27:33.551]  Then 9-11 came along and it just blossomed into almost 40 to 50 percent of Americans believing that something's wrong with the American people.
[01:27:33.551 --> 01:27:36.332]  So I think it's a choice of last resort.
[01:27:36.332 --> 01:27:38.853]  It's certainly out there.
[01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:45.315]  And I think there's a lot of people making statements about it that really don't understand that they don't have the last say.
[01:27:46.090 --> 01:27:53.559]  I think that manipulation is still the order of the game because... Well, I agree with you, but see, they're getting so desperate that they've totally lost the public.
[01:27:53.559 --> 01:27:57.063]  Then they were going to go to an authoritarian takeover.
[01:27:57.063 --> 01:28:02.249]  If they kill Trump, it marks an acceleration and a moving up of their timetable of the complete conversion.
[01:28:03.337 --> 01:28:07.638]  of America into this fascist model that you've been warning they're going to convert to.
[01:28:07.638 --> 01:28:08.838]  And I think it's too early.
[01:28:08.838 --> 01:28:09.618]  They're going to fail.
[01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:13.599]  I think we're moving up their timetable, forcing them.
[01:28:13.599 --> 01:28:16.279]  And there are a lot of elements trying to wind this up.
[01:28:16.279 --> 01:28:18.040]  But here's my issue.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:28.801]  We legally and lawfully, don't we have a responsibility now to see investigations and people being interrogated when they're openly having Clapper and Brennan talking about, well, we're about to remove him in the next few months.
[01:28:28.801 --> 01:28:29.942]  It's moving forward.
[01:28:29.942 --> 01:28:30.862]  It's bipartisan.
[01:28:30.862 --> 01:28:31.622]  It's not impeachment.
[01:28:32.662 --> 01:28:40.627]  They're trying to openly sell this, I think, to build confidence for the option of assassination.
[01:28:40.627 --> 01:28:42.928]  It could be, Alex.
[01:28:42.928 --> 01:28:56.217]  You know, I just don't feel that they can accomplish any of these long-term goals in terms of convincing the American people to go along with an authoritarian thing without this war scenario that I've been predicting for many years of building enemies,
[01:28:57.282 --> 01:29:06.104]  Waiting for Russia and China to attack so that they can drive us into a global new world order because our military has been taken out preemptively.
[01:29:06.104 --> 01:29:12.445]  And, you know, that's why we're here with North Korea, because that timetable has been accelerated.
[01:29:12.445 --> 01:29:24.048]  And even the globalists are uncomfortable with the acceleration of the trigger event in North Korea, which is imminent now, in that Russia and China are showing multiple signs that we're not ready to go along with this yet.
[01:29:25.211 --> 01:29:33.475]  And it means that it's a more complex trigger event because it means that there's going to have to be a second North Korea trigger event later on, which we can explain when I talk about it.
[01:29:33.475 --> 01:29:37.637]  Let's talk about that straight ahead with Joel Skousen.
[01:29:37.637 --> 01:29:40.379]  Trump's fire and fury statement and more.
[01:29:40.379 --> 01:29:44.041]  Infowars.com, the outpost of trying to defend the Republic.
[01:29:44.041 --> 01:29:45.421]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.421 --> 01:29:47.942]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.942 --> 01:29:50.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:57.502]  Why is the fungus?
[01:29:57.502 --> 01:29:58.603]  Why is the mold?
[01:29:58.603 --> 01:30:00.324]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:30:00.324 --> 01:30:01.305]  What is going on?
[01:30:01.305 --> 01:30:02.065]  What has changed?
[01:30:26.361 --> 01:30:27.802]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:30:27.802 --> 01:30:28.823]  I want to get your reviews.
[01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:29.764]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:30:29.764 --> 01:30:31.245]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:30:31.245 --> 01:30:35.749]  MycoZX antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[01:30:35.749 --> 01:30:36.490]  Get it today.
[01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:37.070]  Limited run.
[01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:38.471]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:30:38.471 --> 01:30:43.135]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:43.135 --> 01:30:46.478]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:30:46.478 --> 01:30:48.820]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.701]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:30:50.701 --> 01:30:52.162]  We're changing the world together.
[01:30:52.162 --> 01:30:53.183]  You are the Infowar.
[01:30:53.183 --> 01:30:53.884]  God bless you all.
[01:30:55.936 --> 01:30:58.957]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[01:30:58.957 --> 01:31:03.159]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:31:03.159 --> 01:31:10.482]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:31:10.482 --> 01:31:13.604]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:31:14.324 --> 01:31:34.403]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:31:34.403 --> 01:31:37.947]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:31:38.487 --> 01:31:49.732]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:31:49.732 --> 01:31:54.835]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place.
[01:31:55.695 --> 01:32:06.283]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:06.283 --> 01:32:08.364]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:08.364 --> 01:32:11.227]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:11.227 --> 01:32:12.708]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:12.708 --> 01:32:15.850]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:19.533]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:21.615]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:32:21.615 --> 01:32:31.323]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:31.323 --> 01:32:43.654]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[01:32:43.814 --> 01:32:48.118]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:48.118 --> 01:32:51.421]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:51.421 --> 01:32:53.023]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[01:32:53.023 --> 01:32:53.704]  With a Z-Shield.
[01:32:53.704 --> 01:32:55.025]  At InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:10.626 --> 01:33:15.615]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:15.615 --> 01:33:20.323]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.852 --> 01:33:58.941]  Alright, we're going back to Joel Scousin here in just a moment, but I've got something really important that I've got to get to and I've got to cover right now, briefly.
[01:33:58.941 --> 01:34:07.666]  The attacks on InfoWars are massive and are intense and are
[01:34:08.809 --> 01:34:13.632]  Very complex, very sophisticated, but also very ham-fisted sometimes.
[01:34:13.632 --> 01:34:25.540]  They're shoveling so much money at us to try to shut us down, and shoveling so much money at disinfo operators and criminal groups.
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.882]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:34:27.882 --> 01:34:32.085]  And everything they do just ends up blowing up in their face.
[01:34:34.198 --> 01:34:38.421]  It's gotta be Providence, because you cannot make this type of stuff up.
[01:34:38.421 --> 01:34:46.186]  Kit Daniels is about to publish an article on this to Infowars.com and to Newswars.com, the new site.
[01:34:46.186 --> 01:34:56.193]  Let me document him for TV viewers, and I'm gonna narrate this for radio listeners, but you can go to Infowars.com and see this for yourself.
[01:35:05.911 --> 01:35:18.844]  BuzzFeed has had a reporter off and on for six months or longer following me around.
[01:35:18.844 --> 01:35:25.610]  I mean, the guy's been living in Austin part-time and in between, I guess, New York City.
[01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:27.112]  And BuzzFeed has admittedly
[01:35:29.412 --> 01:35:31.934]  Funded by Soros, the Democrats, and consortiums.
[01:35:31.934 --> 01:35:34.796]  They create the fake PPGate things, all of it.
[01:35:34.796 --> 01:35:35.577]  So, that's what they do.
[01:35:35.577 --> 01:35:37.899]  They manufacture things.
[01:35:37.899 --> 01:35:41.501]  Now, get ready for this.
[01:35:41.501 --> 01:35:42.442]  And this is only part of it.
[01:35:42.442 --> 01:35:44.624]  They write this huge report.
[01:35:44.624 --> 01:35:46.185]  They get our supplements.
[01:35:46.185 --> 01:35:50.268]  They send them to a big California lab in San Francisco.
[01:35:50.268 --> 01:35:51.229]  Now, why is that?
[01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:57.914]  Because they have Prop 65, where there can be less lead in your products than there is in the air.
[01:36:00.939 --> 01:36:09.083]  So it's basically set by lawyers who wrote it admittedly, so that they can sue companies that don't have absolutely pure everything.
[01:36:09.083 --> 01:36:24.951]  Well, I've said, I want to go out in my research and find what the best-selling supplements in America are, that are tried, trued, and on huge platforms, are supported, double, triple tested, and are seen as the best.
[01:36:24.951 --> 01:36:29.754]  And then we go out, and sometimes it takes us years to get one of the top producers to let us private label it.
[01:36:32.191 --> 01:36:36.932]  And of course, now that this is out, they're probably trying to get this group not to sell it to us.
[01:36:36.932 --> 01:36:48.136]  But in their own test of our B12, and they did one more too that they didn't know was private label that they tested as well, and they say, oh, it's just regular bottom B12.
[01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:49.436]  Yeah, it's totally clean.
[01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:50.457]  That's a feat.
[01:36:50.457 --> 01:36:53.157]  Just, oh yeah, by the way, it's as advertised, totally clean.
[01:36:53.157 --> 01:36:54.118]  But it should be $10, not
[01:36:56.942 --> 01:36:57.002]  40.
[01:36:57.002 --> 01:36:58.744]  When we don't sell for 40, we sell for $17.76.
[01:36:58.744 --> 01:37:01.165]  So it's lies, lies, lies.
[01:37:01.165 --> 01:37:02.066]  The top price is $30.
[01:37:02.066 --> 01:37:08.711]  It cost us more than $10 a bottle, and that's how good it is.
[01:37:08.711 --> 01:37:16.676]  Because, you know, we want to sell you the very best product, private label it, then lower the price, because then all the supplement Nazis
[01:37:18.015 --> 01:37:22.499]  People that are really into it, they now know, oh, Jones really does have good stuff.
[01:37:22.499 --> 01:37:23.800]  Then we sell lots of it.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:28.664]  You know, Wurzel gets his story right when he says, Jones is wildly supplement line.
[01:37:28.664 --> 01:37:29.745]  Wildly successful.
[01:37:29.745 --> 01:37:32.508]  Why do you think it's wildly successful?
[01:37:34.241 --> 01:37:45.323]  When I go out and try to produce a whey, I go to the top companies that have the best records that are organic, that are grass-fed, and then I'd sell for $5 less than the very same stuff that's sold at Whole Foods!
[01:37:45.323 --> 01:37:47.383]  But there's no testing of what's going on at Whole Foods.
[01:37:47.383 --> 01:37:48.243]  Oh, no, no.
[01:37:48.243 --> 01:37:51.484]  So, let me just go over this briefly for you.
[01:37:51.484 --> 01:37:57.785]  Here's the big news story, because there's so many angles.
[01:37:57.785 --> 01:38:00.625]  They show, in this report, our vitamin B12.
[01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:00.806]  Okay?
[01:38:04.813 --> 01:38:06.233]  And they say, what more do you say?
[01:38:06.233 --> 01:38:07.314]  It's just vitamin B12.
[01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:11.294]  It should be, you know, $10 or there's $10 a product in it.
[01:38:11.294 --> 01:38:13.855]  Strange they actually got that right.
[01:38:13.855 --> 01:38:15.895]  But what do you say?
[01:38:15.895 --> 01:38:16.716]  It's just vitamin B12.
[01:38:16.716 --> 01:38:18.536]  Okay.
[01:38:18.536 --> 01:38:26.738]  Now, do you know where we get our vitamin B12?
[01:38:26.738 --> 01:38:31.779]  We buy it from the company that Labdoor
[01:38:35.219 --> 01:38:54.494]  Has tested, and out of dozens and dozens of vitamin B12s, the top brands in the country, they give Life Products, the same stuff we sell, they give it the highest rating, and say it's clean, super high quality, and is a great deal at $33.
[01:38:54.494 --> 01:38:55.195]  Excuse me, $35.
[01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:57.296]  Now, we sell the exact same stuff
[01:39:05.592 --> 01:39:12.195]  Just private label, that means our sticker on it, our labeling, for $17.76.
[01:39:12.195 --> 01:39:17.177]  Now here's the big scam.
[01:39:17.177 --> 01:39:24.540]  On their site, they say how great VeganSafe B12 is, and how it's the highest rated they've tested.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:25.960]  Yeah, that's why we sell it.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.701]  See, that's what we do.
[01:39:27.701 --> 01:39:33.183]  So that when we knew you went and tested our products, and all this went on, that people find out we were the best, but then they had a problem.
[01:39:33.183 --> 01:39:33.903]  How do they spin that?
[01:39:33.903 --> 01:39:34.984]  Well, they go, oh look,
[01:39:35.871 --> 01:39:43.795]  His Anthroplex has about $5 a bottle worth of zinc in it and that's not a lot of zinc.
[01:39:43.795 --> 01:39:46.677]  That's because we don't put fillers in and it's used as a drying agent.
[01:39:46.677 --> 01:39:50.119]  So it's a filler that isn't a filler that we need to make the capsules go together.
[01:39:51.161 --> 01:39:57.290]  And it's seen as the natural, healthy thing that isn't a filler, but does that in the manufacturing process.
[01:39:57.290 --> 01:39:59.874]  Then it's got all these other ingredients in it!
[01:39:59.874 --> 01:40:06.303]  So we're not advertising it as a zinc product, it just has some zinc in there that's good for ya, and is used in the drying!
[01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:18.201]  And then we've got all these other ingredients, but you're saying it's $30, but there's $5 in product, but they don't show you the back of the label where it's got all these other things in it!
[01:40:18.201 --> 01:40:28.532]  They say there's only $5 of product in it by selectively saying zinc, knowingly lying, and the lab is telling them this, wild!
[01:40:29.915 --> 01:40:40.484]  They have reviews of the exact same product as number one, and a good deal at $35, and I'm giving you the exact number one rated!
[01:40:40.484 --> 01:40:41.765]  By my adversaries!
[01:40:41.765 --> 01:40:43.946]  1776.
[01:40:43.946 --> 01:40:50.712]  I mean, you could not, and there's a problem.
[01:40:50.712 --> 01:40:52.433]  Look at all these notes I've got.
[01:40:52.433 --> 01:40:55.095]  I could talk for 10 years about the lies in here.
[01:40:55.095 --> 01:40:55.476]  It's like,
[01:40:56.491 --> 01:41:01.113]  It's like a mentally retarded weasel or something wrote it.
[01:41:01.113 --> 01:41:06.736]  I mean, it's just too much.
[01:41:06.736 --> 01:41:09.997]  But it just keeps happening like this.
[01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:12.439]  And I'm going to leave the other one until later.
[01:41:12.439 --> 01:41:13.339]  Article's going up.
[01:41:13.339 --> 01:41:14.379]  I've got to go back to Joel Scalzo.
[01:41:14.379 --> 01:41:16.120]  We've got serious stuff going on in the world.
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.282]  But this is how they're coming after us.
[01:41:19.282 --> 01:41:23.784]  This is what, in fact, Daria thinks Wurzel is actually a fan, and this is unintended.
[01:41:26.112 --> 01:41:30.115]  His bosses don't know that he's sabotaging them every time he does it.
[01:41:30.115 --> 01:41:31.075]  I don't think that's the case.
[01:41:31.075 --> 01:41:41.062]  Because, I mean, you're not going to send it to a lab, and then they're the lab, and then they know, and then they're the lab that has the same product and they don't know.
[01:41:41.062 --> 01:41:45.465]  They're just lazy.
[01:41:45.465 --> 01:41:50.248]  We've got, like, Elderberry that's known to make kids healthy, and they go, this is a scam.
[01:41:51.591 --> 01:41:52.451]  No, no.
[01:41:52.451 --> 01:41:53.612]  He tried to treat autism.
[01:41:53.612 --> 01:41:55.593]  Well, this wouldn't even say autism.
[01:41:55.593 --> 01:41:57.234]  There's no health benefits to this.
[01:41:57.234 --> 01:42:01.095]  There's like a whole section of Whole Foods of elderberry.
[01:42:01.095 --> 01:42:02.796]  It's absolutely known.
[01:42:02.796 --> 01:42:10.600]  And again, they've got elderberry products on Labdoor, certifying how great it is and how clean it is and how good it is.
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:16.104]  But then with the very same lab, then sits there and says how bad our B12 is.
[01:42:16.104 --> 01:42:16.844]  I mean, they don't say anything.
[01:42:16.844 --> 01:42:25.351]  They just say, OK, it's clean, totally clean, and you know, it has to advertise, except it should be $10, not $40 or whatever.
[01:42:25.351 --> 01:42:26.392]  All of it lies.
[01:42:26.392 --> 01:42:30.595]  So, Joel Scalzen, I appreciate you coming on while I did that breakdown of that.
[01:42:30.595 --> 01:42:34.538]  We're getting to North Korea and more, but you're a smart cookie on all this.
[01:42:34.538 --> 01:42:37.160]  I've really been concerned that some of these other unethical groups
[01:42:38.058 --> 01:42:40.699]  We'll actually get our products and spike them for false testing.
[01:42:40.699 --> 01:42:53.823]  So to have BuzzFeed and an adversarial Democratic Party-connected big group out in California connected to all these big lawyers and the whole testing scheme they've got going on out there, this is going to be some of our bigger definitive proof.
[01:42:53.823 --> 01:42:55.243]  We have third parties testing it.
[01:42:55.243 --> 01:42:56.704]  We get it from the top labs.
[01:42:56.704 --> 01:43:03.746]  And we're already doing all the things we need to do to be successful and protect ourselves and get good products to our listeners.
[01:43:05.003 --> 01:43:12.329]  Thank God that they did this hit piece, but then had to certify we've got some totally clean products, which is a feat.
[01:43:12.329 --> 01:43:16.312]  But what do you make of that blowing up that way, particularly?
[01:43:16.312 --> 01:43:26.299]  Well, I can tell you, Alex, that your counter to these false charges and things is far more effective than what people are going to read or believe on BuzzFeed.
[01:43:26.299 --> 01:43:28.561]  So I think this is ultimately going to be counter-effective.
[01:43:28.561 --> 01:43:30.142]  But they're not going to stop.
[01:43:30.142 --> 01:43:33.164]  They're after you because you are effective, and they're not going to stop, ever.
[01:43:34.594 --> 01:43:46.141]  We have to get used to it and roll with the punches, but I think your listeners are sufficiently loyal that they're going to believe and understand that you do provide excellent products, and I think they're going to continue to support you.
[01:43:46.141 --> 01:43:53.486]  Well, why wouldn't I want to sell products, even if I was a sociopath, sell products that work so people want them again?
[01:43:53.486 --> 01:43:54.466]  I don't understand why
[01:43:56.681 --> 01:44:12.241]  Of course we went out and did market research and found what's the best, what's the most effective, what does the FDA leave alone and admit works, what has studies, and then we don't even make claims, even though I've got an FDA lawyer in here and a former inspector, because we knew this was coming, and they said, listen, you can make claims, Alex.
[01:44:12.241 --> 01:44:13.362]  You're not going far enough.
[01:44:14.844 --> 01:44:25.935]  It's just amazing that the very lab they used separately said that the place we get our stuff from is the very best, but then they separately tested ours and said it was a rip-off.
[01:44:25.935 --> 01:44:27.917]  I mean, does that not catch them red-handed?
[01:44:30.009 --> 01:44:32.750]  It's almost laughable, Alex.
[01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:34.211]  But, you know, you've really exposed it.
[01:44:34.211 --> 01:44:39.274]  When Labdor sells the same stuff and gives it a different rating, that's real hypocrisy.
[01:44:39.274 --> 01:44:41.855]  Well, listen, I've been ranting here.
[01:44:41.855 --> 01:44:43.236]  Let's get into North Korea.
[01:44:43.236 --> 01:44:51.240]  Let's get into where you think Trump is right now, where this country's going, as you co-host this hour with us, Joel Scowles on the WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:57.983]  The important thing to remember is that you've got a war going on in the White House of globalists and neocons trying to keep Trump
[01:44:58.975 --> 01:45:02.776]  From doing an effective preemptive strike against North Korea.
[01:45:02.776 --> 01:45:11.138]  And I outline in today's World Affairs Brief, which people can get by simply emailing me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:20.881]  I outline the military strategy that I think is a former Marine Corps fighter pilot that they've got to do to preemptively stop North Korea from a massive retaliation.
[01:45:22.892 --> 01:45:37.337]  In other words, there's three major North Korean sectors where they can project power rapidly towards South Korea or Guam or Hawaii, and one are the ballistic missiles, which right now really don't have anything but conventional warheads.
[01:45:37.337 --> 01:45:47.100]  The Japanese proved that in the last ICBM test where they launched a warhead and it came back into the atmosphere, it burned up and exploded.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:47.920]  In other words, they haven't
[01:45:48.624 --> 01:45:55.329]  Got the technology to be able to keep a warhead from burning up upon re-entry where the temperatures are extremely high.
[01:45:55.329 --> 01:45:59.792]  Warheads glow as they're coming into the atmosphere, but they're not supposed to burst into flames.
[01:45:59.792 --> 01:46:02.914]  The North Korean warhead burst into flames.
[01:46:02.914 --> 01:46:09.098]  So, we're looking at a conventional threat from missiles, which is not that hard to defend again.
[01:46:09.098 --> 01:46:15.443]  But the other two triads of this three-legged offensive capability of North Korea are a massive air force,
[01:46:16.755 --> 01:46:23.418]  Mostly MiG-21s, but they do have 40 MiG-29 aircraft which have long-range capabilities.
[01:46:23.418 --> 01:46:32.803]  The reason that's effective is not so much that they can go up against our F-16s and South Korea's F-16s and Marine Corps F-35s that are in South Korea.
[01:46:34.199 --> 01:46:35.420]  But the U.S.
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:41.822]  needs to have absolute air superiority to take out fully the artillery threat to South Korea.
[01:46:41.822 --> 01:46:55.268]  Because a lot of those artillery units, 170mm big guns, long distance artilleries, are built into tunnels and caves in a series of four ranges of mountains north of the DMZ.
[01:46:56.198 --> 01:47:05.103]  Where they can come out on self-propelled vehicles or on railroad tracks and back into the tunnels after the shot so that any retaliation is blunted.
[01:47:05.103 --> 01:47:05.644]  And the U.S.
[01:47:05.644 --> 01:47:14.088]  needs to have air superiority so they can run roving combat patrols over those areas and immediately attack those guns when they come out.
[01:47:14.088 --> 01:47:16.590]  But this third triad leg is the artillery force.
[01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:25.215]  They've got about 15,000 tubes in the open out there in the DMZ, which has North Korea in range.
[01:47:25.948 --> 01:47:38.972]  So anything that Trump does, whether in a reaction to whatever North Korea does, you know, North Korea can start an artillery barrage of Seoul within seconds after that.
[01:47:38.972 --> 01:47:40.833]  So that's a real threat.
[01:47:40.833 --> 01:47:54.197]  And so those three legs, the missile fields and the storage depots for missiles, the aircraft airfields, and there's about 11 to 15 airfields that have to be taken out, as well as a mass of artillery tubes,
[01:47:55.342 --> 01:48:00.207]  Those have to be done in a preemptive strike in order to make sure that North Korea can't effectively retaliate.
[01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:04.891]  Sure, and I'm not a former naval aviator like you are and a guy who's actually dropped bombs in combat.
[01:48:04.891 --> 01:48:06.012]  Is it the issue here?
[01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:07.894]  I mean, I'm not wanting war.
[01:48:07.894 --> 01:48:13.679]  If we're really going to do it, don't we use a bunch of tactical nuclear weapons on the DMZ to completely wipe them out in a preemptive strike?
[01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:16.802]  I mean, I don't want nuclear war and it seems like the way to stop it if you're going to hit them.
[01:48:17.182 --> 01:48:25.547]  You've got to fully decapitate their military, you've got to block them, or they're going to human wave attack, as they've been trained to do, coming out of those tunnels, totally brainwashed.
[01:48:25.547 --> 01:48:38.576]  They're going to overwhelm a lot of the forces there, and we're going to be in a big quagmire, and we're not going to be able to get all their 100,000 artillery pieces, unless we just bomb the entire DMZ with tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:48:40.603 --> 01:48:50.146]  Obviously from a military point of view, using tactical nuclear weapons as part of the preemptive strike would be the only effective way to take out the entire artillery forces, but I think
[01:48:50.851 --> 01:48:57.637]  I'm positive, in fact, within my military sources there that that's not on the table on a preemptive first strike.
[01:48:57.637 --> 01:49:00.699]  It's got to be conventional at first.
[01:49:00.699 --> 01:49:11.148]  And a conventional strike in the way I'm outlining it, you could get all of the airfields with cruise missile strikes, all of the missile fields simultaneously with about half of the artillery.
[01:49:11.892 --> 01:49:18.356]  The rest of the artillery can be taken out over a period of week, and I can tell you that that will lessen the effect of it.
[01:49:18.356 --> 01:49:27.842]  It won't stop it completely, but I can tell you that the waves of human assault troops coming across the DMZ and their armored corps don't have a chance once the U.S.
[01:49:27.842 --> 01:49:30.704]  has air superiority over the battlefield.
[01:49:30.704 --> 01:49:40.751]  You just simply can't run human waves and tanks across open terrain without getting bombed to death from an enemy that's got air superiority.
[01:49:40.751 --> 01:49:41.131]  And so
[01:49:41.969 --> 01:49:43.793]  Here's what I'm saying though.
[01:49:43.793 --> 01:49:47.520]  The globalists are basically telling Trump, now you can't do anything until...
[01:49:49.016 --> 01:49:51.297]  North Korea actually strikes the U.S.
[01:49:51.297 --> 01:49:54.980]  In other words, they want to wait until there's an actual strike.
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:50:03.605]  Kim Jong-Un, unfortunately, in terms of the globalist point of view, has said, I'm going to strike Guam by August 15th or so.
[01:50:03.605 --> 01:50:12.571]  He's not meaning strike Guam, but he's going to take four ballistic missiles, throw them at Guam, and supposedly target them to be 30 or 40 kilometers offshore.
[01:50:12.571 --> 01:50:15.753]  Now I can tell you, from a military standpoint, when you got
[01:50:16.664 --> 01:50:20.426]  Naval Base, Guam, and you've got Anderson Air Force Base with B-4 bombers.
[01:50:20.426 --> 01:50:23.348]  You've got three nuclear-powered attack submarines.
[01:50:23.348 --> 01:50:28.070]  It's a terrorist act to fire these not very well-guided missiles at the island.
[01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:29.791]  We've got to respond to this.
[01:50:29.791 --> 01:50:30.411]  That's right.
[01:50:30.411 --> 01:50:39.396]  And what I'm saying is there's no way a military force or a president like Trump is going to accept those missiles coming in and depend upon North Korea to actually miss the island.
[01:50:40.445 --> 01:50:42.246]  So we're coming up on a real crisis.
[01:50:42.246 --> 01:50:43.807]  I mean, you've never talked like this before.
[01:50:43.807 --> 01:50:47.308]  I know you really think that this could be it, and I agree.
[01:50:47.308 --> 01:50:51.610]  This is really, really serious, and we all have a sick feeling I've never had before.
[01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:53.031]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:54.969 --> 01:50:58.470]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate?

[01:51:54.611 --> 01:51:56.573]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:56.573 --> 01:52:03.479]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[01:54:11.119 --> 01:54:14.441]  What if I say that I'm just another one in your place?
[01:54:14.441 --> 01:54:15.641]  You're the pretender.
[01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:19.324]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[01:54:19.324 --> 01:54:21.565]  I'm the voice inside your head.
[01:54:21.565 --> 01:54:22.205]  You refuse to hear.
[01:54:22.205 --> 01:54:23.626]  I'm the face that you have to hate.
[01:54:37.071 --> 01:54:40.433]  All right, I've been having Joel Skousen on for, I don't know, 18, 19 years.
[01:54:40.433 --> 01:54:44.135]  I've never really heard him advocating strikes or preemptive strikes.
[01:54:44.135 --> 01:54:48.598]  He was against, you know, the Iraq War, all these things.
[01:54:48.598 --> 01:54:53.201]  And now here he's saying we probably need to hit North Korea first.
[01:54:53.201 --> 01:54:55.162]  I mean, at least if that's on the table.
[01:54:55.162 --> 01:54:58.244]  So let's talk about that and why it's led you to this point and what you're saying.
[01:54:59.690 --> 01:55:10.717]  Well, it's important to realize that even though I'm a libertarian, I disagree with Ron Paul and other libertarians who have tend to have been influenced by the globalist manufacture of war like Iraq.
[01:55:10.717 --> 01:55:13.419]  These were globalist wars of intervention.
[01:55:13.419 --> 01:55:19.362]  These were not true enemies of the United States, but North Korea, Russia, and China are true enemies of the United States.
[01:55:19.362 --> 01:55:24.306]  They are building weapons of mass destruction aimed specifically at taking down the West, not the cities.
[01:55:24.306 --> 01:55:25.867]  They want to decapitate the U.S.
[01:55:25.867 --> 01:55:26.387]  military.
[01:55:27.102 --> 01:55:33.188]  And the globalists actually want to go along with that, as you know, and I've told your listeners before, a decapitation strike on the U.S.
[01:55:33.188 --> 01:55:41.857]  military will serve their purposes in stampeding Americans into believing that the only way to save themselves is to join a militarized global government.
[01:55:41.857 --> 01:55:47.083]  But the key to understanding the North Korean situation, it's been preserved as a trigger event.
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:51.002]  That's the only thing that explains why the U.S.
[01:55:51.002 --> 01:56:02.507]  has dealt permissively with North Korea versus Iran, which has just been ruthlessly persecuted for a nuclear program that is much further behind than North Korea and a missile program to boot.
[01:56:02.507 --> 01:56:03.468]  Yeah, that's the question.
[01:56:03.468 --> 01:56:09.651]  Why did Bill Clinton and the globalist Jimmy Carter enable North Korea even more than China?
[01:56:09.651 --> 01:56:16.634]  Because they want, they know that Russia and China are going to use North Korea as the trigger event to start World War III.
[01:56:17.719 --> 01:56:23.164]  You know, it's the perfect foil to have a crazy man start the war, then Russia turns and says, hey, it's not our fault.
[01:56:23.164 --> 01:56:25.506]  You know, the crazy man started the war, but the U.S.
[01:56:25.506 --> 01:56:29.950]  intervened and we have to back our ally, and so we're going to nuke the United States.
[01:56:32.017 --> 01:56:44.482]  So it's very, very convenient to keep an unstable, immature, actually he's not crazy, he's actually fairly smart, but he's spoiled, rotten, he has delusions of grandeur, and China allows that to happen.
[01:56:44.482 --> 01:56:48.483]  Oh yeah, you can't fake the power trips that guy is having.
[01:56:48.483 --> 01:56:56.146]  A few years ago he looked a little bit scared, but now something happened and he just looks like a complete demon.
[01:56:56.146 --> 01:56:59.487]  Well the key to understanding what's going to happen though is this Guam situation.
[01:57:00.091 --> 01:57:04.073]  You see, the globalists are telling Trump he can't do anything unless he actually attacks.
[01:57:04.073 --> 01:57:12.737]  Well, you know, Kim could play that game forever just threatening and not attacking and allow him to buy more time to build more missiles and more nuclear weapons capability.
[01:57:12.737 --> 01:57:15.778]  And then when he fires a real attack, we don't know that that was a real attack.
[01:57:15.778 --> 01:57:16.659]  We just think it's another test.
[01:57:17.435 --> 01:57:18.295]  That's right.
[01:57:18.295 --> 01:57:22.916]  But in firing four missiles at Guam, I can tell you, the U.S.
[01:57:22.916 --> 01:57:29.657]  at a minimum is going to shoot down those four missiles with this THAAD anti-missile system that is present.
[01:57:29.657 --> 01:57:31.618]  They got a unit on Guam.
[01:57:31.618 --> 01:57:40.199]  They also have other Aegis destroyers that are moving into the area that can use the Aegis missile system to shoot down any of these warheads.
[01:57:40.199 --> 01:57:44.120]  And don't they have some even bigger anti-missile missiles right there in Kauai, Hawaii?
[01:57:45.814 --> 01:57:48.155]  That's right, but not in Guam.
[01:57:48.155 --> 01:57:49.776]  They're going to use the Guam assets.
[01:57:49.776 --> 01:57:53.277]  Hawaii is too far away, you know, to effectively deal with that.
[01:57:53.277 --> 01:58:03.562]  In fact, they could even use the THAAD system in South Korea that could hit these missiles in their boost phase, which when they're most vulnerable, shooting out a brick trail of flames.
[01:58:03.562 --> 01:58:04.702]  Isn't that the way to do it?
[01:58:04.702 --> 01:58:05.943]  Is you blow them up at 20,000 feet?
[01:58:09.205 --> 01:58:09.886]  Or even less.
[01:58:09.886 --> 01:58:13.690]  I mean, yeah, they can get them in the boost phase from South Korean forces.
[01:58:13.690 --> 01:58:20.576]  And if those miss, they can get them as their incoming glowing warheads towards North Korea.
[01:58:20.576 --> 01:58:23.739]  But the key to remember is that Trump now has the excuse to
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:28.201]  Go after North Korea because they've attacked long.
[01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:31.162]  And it's not enough to say we're only aiming for the shore.
[01:58:31.162 --> 01:58:31.742]  That's right.
[01:58:31.742 --> 01:58:35.043]  Let's talk about it in 70 seconds when we start the third hour.
[01:58:35.043 --> 01:58:36.303]  Joel Scouser is our guest.
[01:58:36.303 --> 01:58:37.723]  World Affairs Brief.com.
[01:58:37.723 --> 01:58:38.884]  Key information.
[01:58:38.884 --> 01:58:39.684]  Great analysis.
[01:58:39.684 --> 01:58:42.745]  Looking at every angle of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:42.745 --> 01:58:44.185]  This is all a very dangerous time.
[01:58:46.493 --> 01:58:52.599]  Two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:58:52.599 --> 01:59:05.572]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:59:05.572 --> 01:59:08.896]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:59:09.216 --> 01:59:16.202]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:59:16.202 --> 01:59:29.072]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:59:29.072 --> 01:59:30.934]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:59:30.934 --> 01:59:37.079]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:59:41.482 --> 01:59:43.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:59:59.128 --> 02:00:05.891]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[02:00:05.891 --> 02:00:11.234]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[02:00:11.234 --> 02:00:12.954]  Curfew is now in place.
[02:00:12.954 --> 02:00:14.035]  Return to your homes.
[02:00:21.397 --> 02:00:26.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:28.181]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:54.429]  That's the kind of music that is being produced out there these days.
[02:00:54.429 --> 02:00:59.431]  Just the general public is now picking up the flavor of where all this could go.
[02:00:59.431 --> 02:01:00.911]  Joel Skousen is our guest.
[02:01:00.911 --> 02:01:16.875]  He's getting into the fact that coming up in just a few days, Kim Jong-un, the third generation dictator, toddling around, executing members of his family, you name it, saying he'll nuke the US, he'll do this and that.
[02:01:18.143 --> 02:01:22.204]  I get North Korea trying to look strong, but saying now they're going to fire at U.S.
[02:01:22.204 --> 02:01:26.025]  military bases and have the missiles come in right by the coastline.
[02:01:26.025 --> 02:01:29.066]  Last week, when they shot a missile off, it almost hit an airliner.
[02:01:29.066 --> 02:01:35.307]  I mean, the airliner, according to the trajectory, flew right under it, you know, where the missile came down 10 minutes before.
[02:01:35.307 --> 02:01:41.689]  I mean, that's a busy ocean out there, and you've got a crazy person with this archaic military state.
[02:01:42.489 --> 02:01:48.598]  In the middle of the most popular area of the world, and it's deteriorating, and the globalists did set it up as a trigger.
[02:01:48.598 --> 02:01:49.299]  That's a fact.
[02:01:49.299 --> 02:01:52.263]  So, what do you expect to happen coming up here in a few days, Joel Skousen?
[02:01:53.767 --> 02:02:00.990]  If the actual launch goes on, and that's an if, because China may try to stop Kim knowing that Trump could use this.
[02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:02.951]  China is desperately trying to stop this.
[02:02:02.951 --> 02:02:06.492]  That's the reason they went along with these sanctions at the UN.
[02:02:06.492 --> 02:02:08.473]  They know that they could help bypass the sanctions.
[02:02:08.473 --> 02:02:09.914]  There's no way the U.S.
[02:02:09.914 --> 02:02:17.177]  can stop them because it's all done internally across the border and electronically by shuffling money back and forth.
[02:02:17.177 --> 02:02:18.037]  But the point is,
[02:02:18.763 --> 02:02:27.626]  If this happens on August 15th or even up to the 20th, Trump isn't ready to do a full effective retaliatory response.
[02:02:27.626 --> 02:02:35.869]  Remember the two aircraft carriers left the region here, Carl Vinson and Theodore Roosevelt are offshore San Diego doing carrier calls.
[02:02:36.721 --> 02:02:39.903]  Or maybe Marine Corps squadrons off of San Diego.
[02:02:39.903 --> 02:02:43.264]  And the Ronald Reagan is based in home port in Japan.
[02:02:43.264 --> 02:02:44.325]  So it's in the region.
[02:02:44.325 --> 02:02:47.847]  That's the only carrier that could get there fast enough to take part.
[02:02:47.847 --> 02:02:58.973]  But it's going to take hundreds of cruise missiles and bombers and other things to do an effective three tiered strike that would really truly inhibit North Korea from retaliating against South Korea.
[02:02:58.973 --> 02:02:59.453]  I don't think
[02:03:00.236 --> 02:03:01.217]  Trump can do that.
[02:03:01.217 --> 02:03:14.892]  So what I'm saying is I'm afraid he might be tempted to take one of the options off the military table, which is to attack Kim's military or his missile fields and his missile storage depots to take out the missile threat.
[02:03:14.892 --> 02:03:19.077]  And while that's very laudable and that's not a threat to their people in North Korea,
[02:03:19.736 --> 02:03:22.018]  Kim Jong-un cannot lose face.
[02:03:22.018 --> 02:03:23.579]  He's going to have to retaliate.
[02:03:23.579 --> 02:03:29.584]  And that leaves his Air Force and artillery fully able to immediately strike South Korea.
[02:03:29.584 --> 02:03:31.685]  We've only got one minute left.
[02:03:31.685 --> 02:03:36.329]  The $64 trillion question that could affect all our lives, the future of the planet.
[02:03:36.329 --> 02:03:42.394]  Russia and China, will they stand down if Trump strikes North Korea?
[02:03:43.772 --> 02:03:47.714]  I think it's most probable they will not join in because they're not ready for third world war.
[02:03:47.714 --> 02:03:58.138]  But what they'll do is like Vietnam, they'll channel conventional arms and they'll make it a bloody mess so that Trump will have to make it... it will become an unpopular war.
[02:03:58.138 --> 02:04:01.019]  He'll have to sue for peace short of victory.
[02:04:01.019 --> 02:04:02.479]  And thus that will... That's right.
[02:04:02.479 --> 02:04:03.880]  They're going to try to prop North Korea up.
[02:04:04.733 --> 02:04:14.326]  Right, so Korea can then be another trigger event later on in the next decade because Trump will not be able to successfully bring it to victory and remove Kim.
[02:04:14.326 --> 02:04:19.252]  Or he can just go ahead and decapitate North Korea right now.
[02:04:19.252 --> 02:04:20.594]  What do you mean by decapitate?
[02:04:20.594 --> 02:04:22.337]  Kill Kim Jong-un, take out the leadership.
[02:04:23.271 --> 02:04:26.772]  Yeah, that's very difficult to do, actually, to find out the leadership.
[02:04:26.772 --> 02:04:28.152]  The bunkers.
[02:04:28.152 --> 02:04:35.914]  It can be done within weeks and a month during combat, but it can't be done in a preemptive strike, because you don't always know exactly where he is.
[02:04:35.914 --> 02:04:40.275]  But we've got enough munitions to basically hit every one of their main caves.
[02:04:40.275 --> 02:04:41.555]  Well, no, we don't, really.
[02:04:41.555 --> 02:04:47.836]  I mean, it would take over a thousand cruise missiles just to handle all the air... But none of you use technical nuclear weapons.
[02:04:47.836 --> 02:04:49.597]  If we're going to do it, might as well go all the way.
[02:04:49.597 --> 02:04:50.137]  God bless you.
[02:04:50.137 --> 02:04:50.737]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:04:52.648 --> 02:04:54.049]  Why is the fungus?
[02:04:54.049 --> 02:04:55.150]  Why is the mold?
[02:04:55.150 --> 02:04:56.891]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:04:56.891 --> 02:04:57.852]  What is going on?
[02:04:57.852 --> 02:04:58.612]  What has changed?
[02:05:22.908 --> 02:05:24.329]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[02:05:24.329 --> 02:05:25.369]  I want to get your reviews.
[02:05:25.369 --> 02:05:26.309]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:05:26.309 --> 02:05:27.790]  For me, it's been incredible.
[02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:32.292]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[02:05:32.292 --> 02:05:33.012]  Get it today.
[02:05:33.012 --> 02:05:33.612]  Limited run.
[02:05:33.612 --> 02:05:35.753]  It'll be months until we get more.
[02:05:35.753 --> 02:05:39.675]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:39.675 --> 02:05:43.036]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:05:43.036 --> 02:05:45.357]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:05:45.357 --> 02:05:47.238]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:05:47.238 --> 02:05:48.698]  We're changing the world together.
[02:05:48.698 --> 02:05:49.719]  You are the Infowar.
[02:05:49.719 --> 02:05:50.459]  God bless you all.
[02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:56.834]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:05:56.834 --> 02:06:07.682]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much
[02:06:07.722 --> 02:06:08.262]  We're good to go.
[02:06:32.455 --> 02:06:40.063]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[02:06:40.063 --> 02:06:42.946]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.

[02:08:02.133 --> 02:08:06.514]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:06.514 --> 02:08:08.835]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:12.595 --> 02:08:19.320]  What's your read on the president's reception there so far, and how does it compare to the Saudis' view of previous American presidents?
[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:27.586]  I think that it's being met with incredible celebration and high regard, not just in Saudi Arabia, but in the Arab region overall.
[02:08:27.586 --> 02:08:31.229]  I just traveled in the Arab region a couple of weeks ago in Egypt.
[02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:36.394]  Which is going to have a very big influence in this meeting later on today.
[02:08:36.394 --> 02:08:38.355]  And the reception is tremendous.
[02:08:38.355 --> 02:08:47.863]  They see President Trump as an important ally against radical Islam, against ISIS, and a supporter of good Muslims.
[02:08:47.863 --> 02:08:59.433]  There is not any of the anti-Muslim xenophobia attached to President Trump's image in the Middle East, according to diplomats and military officers and ordinary people that I spoke with during my travels.
[02:09:00.294 --> 02:09:04.497]  And Kanta, how might the U.S.-Saudi relationship change under President Trump?
[02:09:04.497 --> 02:09:06.319]  I think it is already changing.
[02:09:06.319 --> 02:09:11.163]  The hunger for engagement with the United States was reaching a crescendo.
[02:09:11.163 --> 02:09:18.848]  Let's not forget, the Saudi military operation in Yemen was a direct outcome of President Obama's overtures to Iran.
[02:09:18.848 --> 02:09:24.493]  Saudi Arabia realized they were on their own and that initiated a really serious conflict.
[02:09:25.433 --> 02:09:28.574]  They, the influence of Iran has been unchecked.
[02:09:28.574 --> 02:09:45.638]  Not only in these nuclear agreements with the United States, but in its ability to propagate Hezbollah and its activities inside the Arab region to threaten and imperil Israel and to hold hostage Lebanon.
[02:09:45.638 --> 02:09:51.499]  So Iran has to be reined in and that cannot happen without unity of the Sunni world and the United States.
[02:09:54.741 --> 02:09:58.942]  That's Dr. Kanta Ahmed, and she joins us now.
[02:09:58.942 --> 02:10:10.624]  I'm not going to go over all of her bio, it would take a long time, but she's a physician, non-fiction author, broadcast media commentator, and she's written the book, In the Land of the Invisible Woman.
[02:10:10.624 --> 02:10:19.306]  I want to talk about just the waterfront here with her, because again, in most of these radical Islamic countries,
[02:10:21.159 --> 02:10:31.426]  Women basically don't have any freedom, and I don't understand why the left is covering up for this and working with the globalists to try to topple moderate regimes.
[02:10:31.426 --> 02:10:41.152]  But again, her story in itself is incredibly interesting, but she is a spokesperson for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as well.
[02:10:41.152 --> 02:10:43.934]  I can't go over all the stuff she's involved, the different stuff she's done.
[02:10:45.555 --> 02:10:48.116]  And of course, a lot of people have also seen her on the news.
[02:10:48.116 --> 02:10:51.478]  But I don't know where to start here, because I mean, here's some of the articles.
[02:10:51.478 --> 02:10:55.040]  Designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization.
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:55.400]  Absolutely.
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:56.921]  One of the articles she wrote.
[02:10:56.921 --> 02:11:00.103]  As a Muslim American, I will vote my conscience this November.
[02:11:00.103 --> 02:11:03.525]  Again, imagine being a Muslim and then saying that she supported Trump.
[02:11:03.525 --> 02:11:05.326]  The amount of courage that that takes.
[02:11:05.326 --> 02:11:10.329]  And I've always said, if you care about Muslims or Christians or anybody, wouldn't you want to then
[02:11:11.489 --> 02:11:18.856]  uh... not support these radical jihad groups, but the socialists, the globalists, they tend to be empowering them and wanting it.
[02:11:18.856 --> 02:11:26.783]  And just the most dangerous thing in the world if you're a Muslim is being killed in one of these Arab Springs that Hillary Clinton honchos.
[02:11:26.783 --> 02:11:28.644]  Now that's my view on it.
[02:11:28.644 --> 02:11:35.550]  We're going to get Dr. Ahmed's breakdown, because I've got a lot of questions here, Doc, but where should we start for people to really understand
[02:11:36.502 --> 02:11:47.159]  What's happening and why so many leftist elites are seemingly throwing their lot in with the most barbarous forms of Islam.
[02:11:48.666 --> 02:11:49.987]  Hello, Alex.
[02:11:49.987 --> 02:11:52.469]  I mean, it's an overwhelming topic.
[02:11:52.469 --> 02:11:57.052]  I think, first of all, I'm speaking to you today as an individual, not as an academic.
[02:11:57.052 --> 02:11:59.634]  I'm affiliated with a lot of medical institutions.
[02:11:59.634 --> 02:12:01.135]  These are my personal views.
[02:12:01.135 --> 02:12:10.442]  But the personal views I have are born out of being born into Islam, practicing Islam for almost 50 years, coming from the Muslim world and living in the Muslim world.
[02:12:10.882 --> 02:12:15.645]  So first of all, we don't talk about Muslim countries being radical Islamic countries.
[02:12:15.645 --> 02:12:20.189]  There is a Muslim-majority world, which is 56 different nations.
[02:12:20.189 --> 02:12:25.032]  If you think Palestine is an independent state, that becomes 57.
[02:12:25.032 --> 02:12:36.060]  Inside Islam, inside the Muslim world, there is an incredible war going on between Islam proper and Islamism.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:37.521]  We can call that radical Islam.
[02:12:38.081 --> 02:12:47.347]  And that radical Islam masquerades as my religion, wants to be treated with privileges that only religions deserve, but is actually a totalitarianism.
[02:12:47.347 --> 02:12:49.329]  And it's spilling into the West.
[02:12:49.329 --> 02:12:55.333]  The conflict is actually inside Islam and Muslim versus Muslim.
[02:12:55.333 --> 02:13:00.396]  But it is embraced and it's spilled over into the secular democratic world.
[02:13:00.396 --> 02:13:03.598]  So maybe that's a good place to start.
[02:13:03.598 --> 02:13:07.761]  You've also mentioned, very unfortunately, and to my experience,
[02:13:08.822 --> 02:13:20.613]  Many of the Muslim nations ruled by Muslim governments do not accord women, minorities, people of other faiths, the rights and privileges that Islam actually gives them.
[02:13:20.613 --> 02:13:22.055]  I lived in Saudi Arabia.
[02:13:22.055 --> 02:13:25.078]  As a woman, I was designated a legal minor.
[02:13:25.558 --> 02:13:26.759]  I could not drive.
[02:13:26.759 --> 02:13:28.320]  I was forced to bail.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:36.025]  Of course, I practiced as a very highly trained American trained physician and made all of the decisions I would normally do in New York.
[02:13:36.025 --> 02:13:45.371]  But based on their version of Islam, I was denied rights that my family that is Muslim and believes in Islam have always privileged me with.
[02:13:45.371 --> 02:13:48.553]  So the situation is very complex.
[02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:51.715]  You brought up a couple of contemporary events.
[02:13:52.515 --> 02:13:54.638]  What happened to the Arab Spring?
[02:13:54.638 --> 02:14:01.827]  Why did it become this disaster and debacle which really didn't yield positive outcomes for most of the region?
[02:14:01.827 --> 02:14:09.538]  I think the Arab Spring was a cry, a genuine cry, for the people in the Middle East-North Africa region to have democratic representation.
[02:14:10.265 --> 02:14:20.032]  And it was immediately ripe, therefore, to be exploited by the one group that had some sort of civil structures.
[02:14:20.032 --> 02:14:23.034]  Many of these countries don't have strong institutions like we do.
[02:14:23.034 --> 02:14:24.656]  They didn't have mature parliaments.
[02:14:24.656 --> 02:14:25.977]  They didn't have judiciaries.
[02:14:25.977 --> 02:14:27.498]  They didn't have free press.
[02:14:27.498 --> 02:14:31.140]  But what they did have was many members of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:37.165]  And I think probably that's where you want to take the discussion for your diverse and huge viewership today.
[02:14:38.639 --> 02:14:55.053]  Doctor, expanding on that, for folks that don't understand the factions, I mean, as you're saying, there's like groups out there using Islam, you're saying it's kind of a political system or an excuse to expand their power.
[02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:58.476]  And then from reading history books and studying things, I mean, just taking, being veiled
[02:14:59.196 --> 02:15:24.760]  I mean, that was only in certain areas, and people going around out in the desert, kind of like the Japanese covering their faces up, and then some areas of North Africa that had sex trafficking and slavery, you know, then the women would be hooded because you didn't want to have, you know, the merchandise, I guess, getting damaged, and then in the last hundred years of them, wrong or correct, but Saudi Arabia's Wahhabist financing and domination of Islam, being right there at Mecca and now having the oil, they've been able to take Islam, because
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:31.047]  Historians have said there's been a golden age of Islam when it was, you know, not as aggressive as some of the things we've seen in Europe even.
[02:15:31.047 --> 02:15:40.399]  But I mean, clearly there's been this overthrow of more and more states, and more and more radical, and then the very most extreme versions of this, like ISIS.
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:45.642]  Are what's bullying their way to power, and then you have the left allying itself.
[02:15:45.642 --> 02:15:55.765]  I was asking you, why do you think the left is so allied with the most virulent, cult-like, you know, aspects of, as you said, this group that's taking over Islam?
[02:15:55.765 --> 02:15:59.306]  You can argue about the history of Islam or Christianity all day in different periods.
[02:15:59.306 --> 02:16:01.067]  They all have, you know, their good parts, their bad parts.
[02:16:01.067 --> 02:16:05.989]  But if you look at the modern history of Islam, is it not accelerating into
[02:16:07.029 --> 02:16:13.380]  Super radical, barbarous, heart-eating, raping little girls.
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:14.803]  I mean, just insanity.
[02:16:16.175 --> 02:16:21.557]  Well, I mean, what you're describing are images that come out of Islamism.
[02:16:21.557 --> 02:16:28.860]  I will say very clearly, I believe in Islam, I am a Muslim, but I am not a subscriber to Islamism.
[02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:43.445]  Islamism has actually got a 20th century origin, out of Egyptian prisons, by those that were incarcerated, very enamored with Marxist ideologies, and transferred it into a totalitarian construct.
[02:16:44.065 --> 02:17:08.980]  The central features of which are, they seek global domination, transnational caliphate, total autonomy over the self, that's what totalitarianism is, a fictional reinvention of Islamic history, by which they think Islam will be restored to its former greatness through evolutionary jihadism, and at the core driving much of that is a rabid and fictionalized anti-Semitism.
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:11.002]  None of that has basis in Islam.
[02:17:11.622 --> 02:17:16.827]  Now the groups that you're mentioning, you're referring to images that I think are originating from ISIS.
[02:17:16.827 --> 02:17:23.733]  We here in New York and in the United States came under attack from Al-Qaeda, who can forget that day?
[02:17:23.733 --> 02:17:26.295]  You've heard me mention Hezbollah and Hamas.
[02:17:26.295 --> 02:17:33.841]  All of those groups, let's not forget the Pakistani and Afghani Taliban, all of those groups are manifestations of Islamism.
[02:17:34.602 --> 02:17:40.064]  You ask, why is the liberal intelligentsia somehow coming to its rescue?
[02:17:40.064 --> 02:17:42.165]  Let's be very clear.
[02:17:42.165 --> 02:17:45.066]  Islamism is masquerading as a religion.
[02:17:45.066 --> 02:17:51.629]  If you are a progressive secular westerner, you're very concerned not to marginalize anyone's rights.
[02:17:51.969 --> 02:17:53.130]  No matter what they are.
[02:17:53.130 --> 02:17:55.011]  And I share those values.
[02:17:55.011 --> 02:17:57.112]  That is in favor of tolerance.
[02:17:57.112 --> 02:18:07.119]  But if you're unable to distinguish a religion from a political totalitarianism, you are going to shelter a totalitarianism and not know it.
[02:18:07.119 --> 02:18:07.759]  Absolutely.
[02:18:10.761 --> 02:18:14.442]  Would today's liberals provide shelter to Nazis?
[02:18:14.442 --> 02:18:16.383]  Would they provide shelter to communists?
[02:18:16.383 --> 02:18:17.183]  Probably not.
[02:18:17.183 --> 02:18:19.344]  They'd have political arguments with them.
[02:18:19.344 --> 02:18:26.606]  But the Islamists, particularly in the West, in the East we're able to really call them out because we know Islam.
[02:18:26.606 --> 02:18:31.668]  In the West they masquerade as a religious minority and they are becoming elevated as a result.
[02:18:32.247 --> 02:18:37.211]  Dr. Kanta Ahmed is our guest, a scholarly medical doctor, you name it, goes on and on.
[02:18:37.211 --> 02:18:42.154]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes, but I wanted to just get at this point then.
[02:18:42.154 --> 02:18:45.077]  Is this political Islamism still expanding?
[02:18:45.077 --> 02:18:46.998]  Has this been an expansionary phase?
[02:18:46.998 --> 02:18:53.223]  Or do you think with what Trump's done to ISIS and our military, that it seems to be now starting to contract some?
[02:18:53.223 --> 02:18:54.544]  And will the left be able to prop it up?
[02:18:55.782 --> 02:18:57.163]  So great question.
[02:18:57.163 --> 02:18:59.083]  I think two-pronged answer.
[02:18:59.083 --> 02:19:06.266]  I see no reduction in the strength and support for the ideas of Islamism.
[02:19:06.266 --> 02:19:15.329]  In fact, perversely, in about the 15 years that I've been watching this, Islamism is making grounds in terms of controlling the narrative, the story.
[02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:25.516]  The whole reason you and I are having this conversation now, so many years after 9-11, is the Islamist version of reality is being propagated.
[02:19:25.516 --> 02:19:28.238]  And much of my writing is driven to expose that.
[02:19:28.238 --> 02:19:29.359]  All right, let's talk about that.
[02:19:29.359 --> 02:19:30.140]  You're an amazing lady.
[02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:31.921]  Can't wait to have you on again in the future.
[02:19:31.921 --> 02:19:33.822]  I think we've got like 20, 30 more minutes left with you.
[02:19:33.822 --> 02:19:35.604]  Hope you can stay with us because I want to... Sure.
[02:19:36.044 --> 02:19:50.120]  Get into what you see in the future, where we currently are, and how we educate people to defeat Islamism, and then not have that blow back in just a general clash of civilizations with the other forms of Islam as you're breaking down.
[02:19:51.556 --> 02:19:55.318]  If food became scarce, would you be able to feed yourself and your family?
[02:19:55.318 --> 02:20:04.263]  Have you found some emergency food supplies can cost upwards of $300 for a month's supply, and worst of all, they're packed with chemicals and other unpronounceable ingredients?

[02:21:10.481 --> 02:21:11.922]  Or warm and served.

[02:21:21.564 --> 02:21:23.945]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:21:23.945 --> 02:21:31.987]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?

[02:22:50.071 --> 02:22:52.032]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:22:52.032 --> 02:22:57.356]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:22:57.356 --> 02:22:58.938]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:22:58.938 --> 02:23:07.304]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:23:07.304 --> 02:23:12.988]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:23:13.148 --> 02:23:14.990]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:17.251]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:23:17.251 --> 02:23:21.655]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:23:21.655 --> 02:23:23.837]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:23:23.837 --> 02:23:31.643]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:23:32.244 --> 02:23:32.544]  We're good.
[02:24:28.723 --> 02:24:55.082]  Dr. Kanta Ahmed is a best-selling author, researcher, medical doctor, and one of the most intellectual, focused individuals out there that isn't just the absolute, complete, cartoon demonization of Islam we see by some people, including by me sometimes, because you see the Islamicist issues pointing out, which is this political modern movement, picked up in the prisons of Egypt, picked up in the prisons of Europe,
[02:24:56.448 --> 02:25:16.726]  And then it's this weird amalgamation of socialism with it, and then out of that, we see this new super-political Islam that's allied with the left, and George Soros, who thinks that that's the future, to get Islam to totally convert to Islamist, this system.
[02:25:16.726 --> 02:25:18.988]  If you politically control that, that is a lot of power.
[02:25:19.668 --> 02:25:21.669]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:25:21.669 --> 02:25:35.937]  She's a big critic of Linda Sorcerer, whose family's in prison for being terrorists in Israel, who says jihad overthrew Trump, who just says all manner of have jihad in America, and she's the poster person.
[02:25:35.937 --> 02:25:37.618]  And then, Newsweek time.
[02:25:39.412 --> 02:25:44.873]  CNN, USA Today, you know, says, oh, wear the hijab, wear a burqa.
[02:25:44.873 --> 02:25:46.093]  It's feminism.
[02:25:46.093 --> 02:25:55.535]  When I read about, in Egypt and everywhere, the first big good feminist movements, women were killed and imprisoned by the thousands for saying, I'm not going to wear a hijab and I'm going to go to college.
[02:25:55.535 --> 02:25:57.115]  That was first-wave feminism.
[02:25:57.115 --> 02:26:04.457]  Now it's so sick that third-wave feminism, women are literally out there embracing this political
[02:26:05.317 --> 02:26:10.440]  A system that you've described as not really being what you'd call classical Islam.
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:12.061]  Please continue.
[02:26:12.061 --> 02:26:18.224]  So I think we... It's a very difficult subject.
[02:26:18.224 --> 02:26:21.846]  I write and think about this all of the time for over a decade.
[02:26:21.846 --> 02:26:26.529]  What is happening amongst liberal progressives in the United States and well-intentioned Americans.
[02:26:26.529 --> 02:26:32.512]  My experience of Americans has been that they're benevolent, they're welcoming, and they are very accepting.
[02:26:34.772 --> 02:26:41.936]  Political Islam in this country has been portrayed under the lens of a racial civil rights issue.
[02:26:41.936 --> 02:26:45.257]  Let's just explain why that doesn't work.
[02:26:45.257 --> 02:26:49.479]  Muslims are in 183 different nations around the world.
[02:26:49.479 --> 02:26:53.000]  In the United States, we come from 69 different countries.
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.041]  This is not a race issue.
[02:26:55.041 --> 02:26:56.542]  This is an issue about ideology.
[02:26:57.382 --> 02:27:14.834]  Even five to six years ago when I testified to the Homeland Security Committee about the need to look for domestic radicalization of Muslims in the United States, I'm on record testifying to that after listening to evidence from Muslim parents whose children became radicalized in this country.
[02:27:14.834 --> 02:27:20.618]  I could see the beginnings of an effort to coach that into a civil rights violation.
[02:27:21.318 --> 02:27:25.561]  Exposing Islamism in the United States is not a civil rights violation.
[02:27:25.561 --> 02:27:31.726]  It is a protection of democracy, but also protection of Islam.
[02:27:31.726 --> 02:27:36.250]  If we do not challenge these believers, they get to talk for all of us.
[02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:36.530]  Sorry.
[02:27:36.530 --> 02:27:38.391]  No, no, you're absolutely on target.
[02:27:38.391 --> 02:27:42.094]  And proving your point that this is not the real classical Islam,
[02:27:43.274 --> 02:27:53.750]  Is that most of the recruiting is in the West by second and third generation people that are being recruited by the new weird Western meets Islam meets socialism mutation.
[02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:54.491]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:27:55.290 --> 02:28:01.372]  Well, that's part of it, but it's not just someone sitting in their bedroom getting radicalized here in the West.
[02:28:01.372 --> 02:28:12.375]  It is the fact that we have organizations that are being embraced as Muslim advocacy groups when they actually have Islamist ideas or Islamist foundations.
[02:28:12.375 --> 02:28:19.637]  And I'm thinking of groups like the Council on American Islamic Relations, which is outlawed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
[02:28:20.117 --> 02:28:36.888]  It's the idea that criticizing the Muslim Brotherhood when I try to say we should designate the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization, it is very difficult to get those ideas published in liberal media because that is considered an Islamophobic view.
[02:28:36.888 --> 02:28:48.035]  When Muslims here and Muslims in the Muslim world recognize that the Muslim Brotherhood is exploiting an Islamic identity and underneath is really a wolf in lamb's clothing.
[02:28:49.275 --> 02:28:58.440]  When I speak to Arab or Muslim diplomats, both here and overseas, we cannot believe the free reign Islamist ideas are getting in the United States.
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:01.682]  This kind of conversation is not difficult in Pakistan.
[02:29:01.682 --> 02:29:03.823]  It is not difficult in Saudi Arabia.
[02:29:03.823 --> 02:29:07.925]  In Pakistan, I've traveled with Pakistani military and met with jihadists.
[02:29:07.925 --> 02:29:11.187]  We call jihadists jihadists, and we are Muslim.
[02:29:11.807 --> 02:29:19.659]  So, why are we tied up in saying if I identify someone as this, I'm Islamophobic or I'm violating his civil rights?
[02:29:19.659 --> 02:29:20.500]  It's perverse!
[02:29:21.601 --> 02:29:22.862]  Wow, this is powerful.
[02:29:22.862 --> 02:29:25.684]  Lay this out for us, doctor, when we come back.
[02:29:25.684 --> 02:29:27.826]  Because, I mean, I've researched this intensely.
[02:29:27.826 --> 02:29:30.808]  I've heard nobody lay it out as clearly as you do.
[02:29:30.808 --> 02:29:33.450]  This stuff isn't even allowed in those Muslim countries.
[02:29:33.450 --> 02:29:37.873]  Then we incubate it here and then send it over there with George Soros funding it.
[02:29:37.873 --> 02:29:42.677]  He's conquering the Muslim world and conquering the West with political Islam!
[02:29:42.677 --> 02:29:42.817]  Wow!
[02:29:42.817 --> 02:29:43.177]  Wow!
[02:29:43.177 --> 02:29:43.818]  We'll be back.
[02:29:52.085 --> 02:29:53.486]  Why is the fungus?
[02:29:53.486 --> 02:29:54.567]  Why is the mold?
[02:29:54.567 --> 02:29:56.308]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:29:56.308 --> 02:29:57.269]  What is going on?
[02:29:57.269 --> 02:29:58.049]  What has changed?
[02:30:22.325 --> 02:30:23.766]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[02:30:23.766 --> 02:30:25.747]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:30:25.747 --> 02:30:27.208]  For me, it's been incredible.
[02:30:27.208 --> 02:30:31.730]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:32.550]  Get it today.
[02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:34.451]  Limited around, it'll be months till we get more.
[02:30:34.451 --> 02:30:39.114]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:39.114 --> 02:30:42.455]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:30:42.455 --> 02:30:44.776]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:30:44.776 --> 02:30:46.217]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:30:46.217 --> 02:30:48.138]  We're changing the world together.
[02:30:48.138 --> 02:30:49.158]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:30:49.158 --> 02:30:49.899]  God bless you all.
[02:30:51.778 --> 02:31:00.520]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:01.061]  That's right.
[02:31:01.061 --> 02:31:06.322]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[02:31:06.322 --> 02:31:13.004]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[02:31:13.004 --> 02:31:20.246]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:31:20.606 --> 02:31:20.806]  Woo!
[02:31:20.806 --> 02:31:21.847]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:31:21.847 --> 02:31:30.592]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:31:30.592 --> 02:31:40.198]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:31:40.198 --> 02:31:43.640]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:47.742]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:31:47.742 --> 02:31:48.603]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:31:48.803 --> 02:31:52.066]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:52.066 --> 02:31:57.470]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:57.470 --> 02:32:00.332]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:32:00.332 --> 02:32:02.314]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:32:02.314 --> 02:32:07.338]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:32:07.338 --> 02:32:09.420]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.721]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:32:10.721 --> 02:32:15.605]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:15.805 --> 02:32:22.687]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:32:22.687 --> 02:32:25.688]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:32:25.688 --> 02:32:29.389]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:32:29.389 --> 02:32:36.291]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:36.291 --> 02:32:42.153]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodide,
[02:32:42.353 --> 02:32:47.395]  He aligns himself with the truth, but it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:32:47.395 --> 02:32:48.456]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.303 --> 02:33:23.724]  Dr. Quanta Ahmed is our guest.
[02:33:23.724 --> 02:33:30.105]  Here's a clip of Rich Higgins who got fired two weeks ago by McMaster who has allied the political Islam.
[02:33:30.105 --> 02:33:39.748]  That's what the scholars are saying with Soros and others, works for Soros, brief Soros, on the radicalization, on the Muslim Brotherhood, on who really runs
[02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:47.494]  This political Islam that is allied with the globalist for worldwide domination.
[02:33:47.494 --> 02:33:52.919]  And that means of Muslim countries, that means of Western countries, that means everybody.
[02:33:52.919 --> 02:33:56.783]  The number one killer of Muslims is this political Islam.
[02:33:56.783 --> 02:34:00.666]  And you can debate, you know, Islam's history and past and good periods, bad periods.
[02:34:00.666 --> 02:34:01.967]  It's undoubtable though.
[02:34:02.708 --> 02:34:15.599]  That this new form is cancerous and is, as she said, masquerading and then discrediting people that you would call, I guess, classical Muslims from her perspective.
[02:34:15.599 --> 02:34:27.109]  But you cannot, you know, deny the fact that the globalists are backing it and that that was exposed to Congress and that was exposed to the Pentagon and they know that and anybody that knows it is being fired.
[02:34:27.109 --> 02:34:27.910]  So here is the clip.
[02:34:28.914 --> 02:34:43.367]  I think we saw very purposefully, immediately after 9-11, Muslim Brotherhood entities identified and provided to, for example, the Society of Professional Journalists.
[02:34:43.367 --> 02:34:45.408]  So when the Society of Professional Journalists
[02:34:46.229 --> 02:34:48.212]  Have an incident happen.
[02:34:48.212 --> 02:34:58.986]  They have a little caller list that was provided to them in the organizations that they were directed to, you know, if an incident happens and you need to find somebody inside the Muslim community to talk to.
[02:34:58.986 --> 02:35:00.989]  Everyone they spoke to was Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:35:01.870 --> 02:35:18.657]  We see that at the political level, where our congressional members and in the executive branch, our senior general officers, our senior executives, oftentimes, not always, but oftentimes, the people that they are interfacing with are Muslim Brotherhood affiliated organizations.
[02:35:18.657 --> 02:35:23.519]  I tell people, Al-Qaeda, ISIS, they are not going to win the war on terrorism.
[02:35:23.519 --> 02:35:26.600]  The Muslim Brotherhood is going to win the war on terrorism.
[02:35:29.215 --> 02:35:32.236]  And that is basically what Dr. Ahmed is saying.
[02:35:32.236 --> 02:35:35.797]  So, Doctor, you were laying this out earlier as we went to break.
[02:35:35.797 --> 02:35:37.497]  Please continue.
[02:35:37.497 --> 02:35:39.738]  Who is that speaking, Alex?
[02:35:39.738 --> 02:35:49.240]  That is Mr. Higgins from the Pentagon who was then also working for Trump in the National Security Council.
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:54.001]  And he got canned then after this memo was made public.
[02:35:54.986 --> 02:35:55.326]  I see.
[02:35:55.326 --> 02:36:03.749]  Well, I don't know about that, but I think that the United States' relationship with the Muskin Brotherhood dates back much further to the Eisenhower era.
[02:36:03.749 --> 02:36:12.332]  And one of the most fantastic books to read about it and experts in the field is a man, a journalist called Ian Johnson, who wrote a book called The Muskin Unit.
[02:36:12.332 --> 02:36:16.394]  So I would suggest that everybody look at that book and learn more about it.
[02:36:17.374 --> 02:36:22.157]  And sometimes it's not with ill intentions that the United States is engaged with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:36:22.157 --> 02:36:27.941]  The Muslim Brotherhood has been very good at becoming media savvy, at becoming available.
[02:36:27.941 --> 02:36:31.303]  As you know, Islam is fraught with sectarian divides.
[02:36:31.303 --> 02:36:33.244]  We don't have the equivalent of a Pope.
[02:36:33.244 --> 02:36:40.208]  So when you are a government, you're going to reach out to a group that looks a bit like representing everyone without understanding that they don't.
[02:36:40.208 --> 02:36:42.549]  So that's not so surprising.
[02:36:43.570 --> 02:36:45.151]  That's not so unsurprising.
[02:36:45.151 --> 02:37:03.087]  But if you want to read a Muslim and understand the Muslim Brotherhood's reach and why it's not just the media and it's not just government appointees or you want to blame a Democrat administration or Republican administration, it's actually academia in the field of Middle Eastern studies that has perpetuated a lot of this
[02:37:04.207 --> 02:37:05.388]  Confusion.
[02:37:05.388 --> 02:37:08.490]  Refusing to distinguish Islam from Islamism.
[02:37:08.490 --> 02:37:11.812]  Please read the Muslim academic Bassam Tibi.
[02:37:11.812 --> 02:37:15.114]  B-A-S-S-A-M, first name, last name Tibi.
[02:37:15.114 --> 02:37:16.495]  T-I-B-I.
[02:37:16.495 --> 02:37:18.076]  Most of his work is in German.
[02:37:18.076 --> 02:37:20.158]  Many of his books are translated in English.
[02:37:20.158 --> 02:37:26.762]  40 years of scholarship on how the Muslim Brotherhood operates inside the Muslim world and outside the Muslim world.
[02:37:27.162 --> 02:37:34.447]  And I do not know, I'm not familiar with Higgins, but I would imagine that is exactly how the Muslim Brotherhood works.
[02:37:34.447 --> 02:37:41.032]  They are grotesquely underestimated in the United States and they have been long underestimated in Europe.
[02:37:41.032 --> 02:37:45.615]  One of the arguments I get from editors is, how can you prove the Muslim Brotherhood causes terrorism?
[02:37:46.195 --> 02:37:48.477]  Well, they often are not pulling the trigger.
[02:37:48.477 --> 02:37:58.923]  But none of these groups, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, they would never exist without a non-violent ideological underpinning.
[02:37:58.923 --> 02:38:11.191]  And for almost 20 years after 9-11, we have to separate the fact that, yes, there's violent jihadism, but there is a powerful totalitarian ideology underneath that, which is driving violent jihadism.
[02:38:11.191 --> 02:38:15.514]  And therefore, the Muslim Brotherhood is responsible for all of these modern
[02:38:16.715 --> 02:38:34.398]  And by the way, if anyone doubts my belief or my authenticity and commitment to Islam, we can refer only to the Quran itself which warns Muslims that there will be those who will cede and betray insurrection from within their mosques.
[02:38:34.778 --> 02:38:38.879]  With no intention other than to divide the society around them.
[02:38:38.879 --> 02:38:49.641]  The gravest sin in Islam, other than equating somebody to God, just like in many monotheisms, that's a grave sin, is to create insurrection and disrupt society.
[02:38:49.641 --> 02:38:51.962]  And that is what the Muslim Brotherhood is doing.
[02:38:51.962 --> 02:38:57.783]  When they asked the Prophet in his lifetime, while he was still alive, what do you most fear?
[02:38:57.783 --> 02:39:02.344]  They asked the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, what do you most fear is going to happen to your followers?
[02:39:02.984 --> 02:39:10.847]  He first refused to answer and then finally reluctantly said, what I fear most is going to come and emerge from among you.
[02:39:10.847 --> 02:39:17.949]  They will appear as if they quote the Quran perfectly, but it will go no further than their throats, meaning it will spare their hearts.
[02:39:17.949 --> 02:39:23.050]  And these people will come suddenly, as if an arrow that slays its quarry.
[02:39:23.050 --> 02:39:27.512]  That means pass through a society like an arrow goes through the beast it's targeting.
[02:39:28.072 --> 02:39:28.172]  Wow.
[02:39:51.823 --> 02:39:56.890]  The headlines a few years ago were Obama caught secretly working with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:39:56.890 --> 02:39:58.332]  There was nothing secret.
[02:39:58.332 --> 02:40:01.035]  The entire Western world, France,
[02:40:02.168 --> 02:40:21.488]  The UK finally voted and said no about six years ago, and then that caused the domino effect within our own military, saying we're not going to back these Islamist groups in Syria, and this Western-backed Arab Spring was toppling regimes that were far better, and, you know, kicking women out of college and putting burqas back on their heads.
[02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:46.294]  And this reign of terror and there was Anderson Cooper in Egypt celebrating the violent overthrow of the government and churches being blown up and there's Anderson Cooper saying these are the good guys as gays are being thrown off buildings and then there's the left and the CIA, the leftist branches of it, funding this to destabilize the Middle East and that's what's sick.
[02:40:46.294 --> 02:40:50.595]  The political left may think it's allied with a political Islam.
[02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:52.436]  In the mid-level.
[02:40:52.436 --> 02:41:00.125]  But at the high levels, the globalists are exploiting it to destabilize and topple moderate regimes.
[02:41:00.125 --> 02:41:02.368]  I'm not defending Assad, but they had nice beaches.
[02:41:02.368 --> 02:41:04.250]  Europeans were going there.
[02:41:04.250 --> 02:41:05.852]  Asians were coming there as a destination.
[02:41:05.852 --> 02:41:07.113]  Russians were going there.
[02:41:07.113 --> 02:41:08.275]  And women were going to college.
[02:41:08.275 --> 02:41:09.576]  And women were in positions of authority.
[02:41:10.572 --> 02:41:13.093]  But then all the fake feminists just ignore all that.
[02:41:13.093 --> 02:41:14.134]  I mean, I have three daughters.
[02:41:14.134 --> 02:41:15.395]  I take this serious.
[02:41:15.395 --> 02:41:17.236]  I want them to be able to do whatever they want.
[02:41:17.236 --> 02:41:19.837]  And I'd like to be able to, you know, have women be free in other countries as well.
[02:41:19.837 --> 02:41:27.702]  So I've seen our elites really ally with the most sickening, barbarous, foaming at the mouth, demon-like creatures.
[02:41:30.283 --> 02:41:34.328]  Revel in just the most horrible atrocities.
[02:41:34.328 --> 02:41:35.990]  It's incredible, and I agree with you.
[02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:38.853]  Say what people want about the history of Islam, debate it all day long.
[02:41:38.853 --> 02:41:42.418]  You can debate the history of Christianity in different periods, in different sects, in different groups.
[02:41:42.418 --> 02:41:44.900]  You can find the entire compendium of human activity there.
[02:41:45.461 --> 02:41:51.526]  But there's no doubt the greatest threat to Islamic countries and Muslims in general is this political Islam.
[02:41:51.526 --> 02:41:52.527]  I mean, the numbers.
[02:41:52.527 --> 02:41:57.571]  Millions a year killed in the civil wars and wars these guys start.
[02:41:57.571 --> 02:42:04.057]  And so it's a real crime that the political left, the feminists and all of them are out cheerleading for the likes of Lyndon Sarsour.
[02:42:05.916 --> 02:42:13.861]  Well, you know, I think many of the things that you're saying, I am not familiar with the specific events, but Egypt is a wonderful example to bring to.
[02:42:13.861 --> 02:42:21.366]  And one of the reasons I visited Egypt is I spent months writing about the Muslim Brotherhood, and I felt it was a gap in my knowledge.
[02:42:21.366 --> 02:42:27.290]  Egypt itself, almost 95 million people came out in the streets.
[02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:33.154]  This is a country that is over 90% Muslim, in order to overthrow Mohammed Morsi.
[02:42:33.154 --> 02:42:35.476]  Mohammed Morsi was the Muslim Brotherhood leader,
[02:42:36.056 --> 02:42:43.197]  His chapters were perfectly placed when there was an Arab Spring and a public call for an election.
[02:42:43.197 --> 02:43:01.301]  So the Muslim Brotherhood swept in and promptly began to shore their powers such that within a year he had given himself more powers above even the Supreme Court that the previous dictator Muslim, excuse me, Hosni Mubarak, had even accumulated in 30 years of being a dictator.
[02:43:01.821 --> 02:43:13.752]  So Muslims out in the streets, intellectuals, tea sellers, drivers, they came out to ask and cause a second revolution to remove the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:43:13.752 --> 02:43:20.679]  Ask yourself in the United States, why do Muslims not want the Muslim Brotherhood in elected power?
[02:43:20.679 --> 02:43:25.724]  And start to question why there seems to be this enamorment with what is possible.
[02:43:25.964 --> 02:43:31.806]  How does the Muslim Brotherhood get banned everywhere by Sunnis and by Shiites when it's supposedly Sunni?
[02:43:31.806 --> 02:43:34.487]  I mean, it's just, it's like the plague.
[02:43:34.487 --> 02:43:40.929]  And I want to say, I mean, I was certainly a critic of President Obama because of the Middle East policies.
[02:43:40.929 --> 02:43:47.711]  And also, I actually did not vote for President Trump for a number of reasons, but whoever is my president... Okay, I misunderstood.
[02:43:47.711 --> 02:43:51.313]  I thought I saw an editorial, I thought I saw an editorial implying that, but you still...
[02:43:52.093 --> 02:43:55.456]  That's okay, but I will support whoever's in elected power.
[02:43:55.456 --> 02:44:03.484]  But what's missing here is knowledge, and not only knowledge, it comes from academia, it seeps into the media, and it enters the public space.
[02:44:03.484 --> 02:44:05.606]  There's a lack of curiosity.
[02:44:05.606 --> 02:44:08.229]  What is the difference between Islam and Islamism?
[02:44:08.229 --> 02:44:15.857]  It's not ordinary people asking this, it's academics in the Middle East studies, in the United States, who think that that is not a useful discussion.
[02:44:16.457 --> 02:44:22.001]  And Muslims, we think it is critical to understanding what's going wrong in the world.
[02:44:22.001 --> 02:44:25.864]  So I'm not surprised President Obama may have engaged with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:44:25.864 --> 02:44:27.645]  President Eisenhower did.
[02:44:27.645 --> 02:44:29.126]  So why would it change?
[02:44:29.126 --> 02:44:34.170]  And even with President Trump, I really support his commitment to combating ISIS.
[02:44:34.170 --> 02:44:35.151]  It was very lacking.
[02:44:35.151 --> 02:44:36.452]  It's been very delayed.
[02:44:36.452 --> 02:44:38.233]  We have it now.
[02:44:38.233 --> 02:44:44.218]  I can see the response in the Sunni world firsthand when I visit there and of course through the media that you played earlier.
[02:44:44.878 --> 02:44:46.821]  But that may not be enough.
[02:44:46.821 --> 02:44:49.524]  We have to go after exposing these ideas.
[02:44:49.524 --> 02:44:50.405]  And I'll tell you how.
[02:44:50.405 --> 02:44:53.589]  You know, we are very safe in the continental United States.
[02:44:53.589 --> 02:44:55.070]  We're very protected.
[02:44:55.070 --> 02:44:58.534]  We do not have the situation we have in London and France.
[02:44:58.534 --> 02:45:00.076]  But there is now a new idea.
[02:45:00.697 --> 02:45:10.845]  That was never present in the history of Islam, that emerged from 1970s Iran, which is now chilling the public discourse, and that is something called Islamophobia.
[02:45:10.845 --> 02:45:17.390]  You will not find spiritual or religious decrees on Islamophobia anywhere in the 1400 year history of Islam.
[02:45:19.051 --> 02:45:30.782]  But now, this conversation that you and I are having is one that is very difficult to have in any public space without being slandered or slurred as an Islamophobe.
[02:45:30.782 --> 02:45:33.945]  I'm even attacked for having this conversation with you.
[02:45:33.945 --> 02:45:40.771]  The reason is, I think these ideas are so important, I value any audience that can learn about them and read the scholars that I mentioned.
[02:45:40.771 --> 02:45:45.195]  Well exactly, but that's what the left does, is they go out and they bully anybody on Twitter and Facebook, I guess you're probably getting that.
[02:45:45.575 --> 02:45:49.922]  That's a sign you're effective when they're bullying, saying, how dare you go on this show?
[02:45:49.922 --> 02:45:51.384]  They want to control the discourse.
[02:45:51.384 --> 02:45:52.806]  They want to control the debate.
[02:45:52.806 --> 02:45:58.636]  And now I've noticed the thing you get censored for the most on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, you name it.
[02:46:00.191 --> 02:46:23.122]  is criticizing third and fourth wave super crazy radical feminism that says you having he or she words is wrong and or criticizing political modern radical expansionist whatever you want to call it Islamist systems and so again we need to stand up and intensify speaking out to let the bullies know we're not going to shut up.
[02:46:24.022 --> 02:46:32.869]  Well, let's just focus on Islamophobia, which is what I'm an expert on, and I don't know anything about feminism that you're referring to.
[02:46:32.869 --> 02:46:42.317]  But Islamophobia was coined and propagated and has been subject to multiple UN resolutions supporting Islamophobia.
[02:46:42.777 --> 02:46:48.624]  By the modern Iranian state, which is an Islamist pseudo-democracy.
[02:46:48.624 --> 02:47:03.800]  The whole goal of Islamophobia, the concept of Islamophobia, is to criminalize the scrutiny of any Islamic institution, Islamic entity, an Islamic idea.
[02:47:04.841 --> 02:47:08.963]  There is nothing in Islam that says we cannot be scrutinized.
[02:47:08.963 --> 02:47:13.124]  And I am confident Islam will exist for another 1,500 years.
[02:47:13.124 --> 02:47:15.325]  It's like Judaism or Christianity.
[02:47:15.325 --> 02:47:18.166]  These things do not wither under scrutiny.
[02:47:18.166 --> 02:47:23.608]  But totalitarianism masquerading as a religion is destroyed by scrutiny.
[02:47:23.608 --> 02:47:30.130]  So wouldn't it serve me if I was an Iranian Islamic pseudo-democrat?
[02:47:30.130 --> 02:47:32.271]  Well, I don't really want to be put to the litmus test
[02:47:32.691 --> 02:47:39.176]  Let me make it equivalent to anti-semitism by which it has absolutely no equivalence.
[02:47:39.176 --> 02:47:46.822]  Anti-semitism is a completely different genocide than legal hatred.
[02:47:46.822 --> 02:47:48.243]  That's the goal.
[02:47:48.243 --> 02:47:52.587]  Islamophobia is seeking to make itself equivalent to anti-semitism.
[02:47:52.587 --> 02:47:57.871]  That is a falsehood and that is seeking only to control the public discourse.
[02:47:57.871 --> 02:47:58.612]  So actually,
[02:47:59.352 --> 02:48:14.742]  Even though we have many problems with terrorism in the Muslim-majority world and Western Europe, where there are many more Muslims than live in the United States, in numbers and percentages, we are much more at threat if we do not defend the freedom of inquiry and freedom of ideas.
[02:48:14.742 --> 02:48:22.607]  And so again I come back, for those that are seriously interested, read the Muslim scholar Bassam Tibi, read his texts,
[02:48:23.087 --> 02:48:31.215]  And learn about why these things matter so much to believing Muslims, not only to those of us that really are committed to democracy, too.
[02:48:31.215 --> 02:48:32.316]  Well, you're right.
[02:48:32.316 --> 02:48:38.002]  I mean, in all your history, I mean, of course, no more than I do, but Iran said we are an Islamic state.
[02:48:38.002 --> 02:48:38.582]  So when this
[02:48:39.743 --> 02:48:43.644]  Sunni's start trying to copy the Shiites now with their Islamic State.
[02:48:43.644 --> 02:49:05.052]  It is truly a political form of Islam to keep even political parties in power where you can't criticize the Ayatollahs because because they are the state and so criticizing Islam's illegal so criticizing the state's illegal and you can keep a group in power who's only got maybe 20% support rate and the young people obviously one out from under it.
[02:49:05.052 --> 02:49:07.813]  So that's the truth is that in Iran and countless other
[02:49:08.792 --> 02:49:37.466]  Muslim nations, people want to be freer and they want to get back to the more golden age of Islam and the rest of it, but they're being beaten over the head in between political Islam and then it's being supported by George Soros in the West, force-feeding that this is Islam because it's a poison pill for people that are Muslims or people that are Christians or people that are atheists, but they've dumbed it down with virtue signaling where people can just say, oh Muslims are perfect, never criticize any of them,
[02:49:37.706 --> 02:49:40.229]  And then now you got a group, as you said, that aren't even really Muslims.
[02:49:40.229 --> 02:49:43.152]  They're like this super radical political cult cancer.
[02:49:43.152 --> 02:49:46.376]  And so it's growing out of control because no one can criticize it.
[02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:49.319]  And the biggest group of people it's killing are Muslims.
[02:49:49.319 --> 02:49:50.660]  And it's just incredible.
[02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:54.885]  Doctor, what's the best website or place for people to visit, find out about your book and more?
[02:49:56.671 --> 02:49:58.752]  The book is available wherever books are sold.
[02:49:58.752 --> 02:50:02.936]  You can learn more and just look for me on social media and you'll find that.
[02:50:02.936 --> 02:50:05.618]  But I just want to end with one last point.
[02:50:05.618 --> 02:50:08.700]  It's worth saying the Quran is a very short book.
[02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:09.741]  80,000 words only.
[02:50:09.741 --> 02:50:11.323]  My book was twice as long.
[02:50:11.323 --> 02:50:14.365]  It does not specify a form of government.
[02:50:14.365 --> 02:50:18.228]  It does not require a caliphate.
[02:50:18.228 --> 02:50:22.372]  It does not, in fact, it absolutely refuses compulsion in belief.
[02:50:23.052 --> 02:50:34.665]  So while those of us that criticize Islamists, you and I, are called bigoted, or we're called fascists, or we're called racists, actually that is what Islamism is.
[02:50:34.665 --> 02:50:38.549]  Islam itself is multi-tolerant.
[02:50:38.549 --> 02:50:39.650]  Doctor, we're out of time.
[02:50:39.650 --> 02:50:40.291]  Please come back.
[02:50:40.751 --> 02:50:42.012]  Please come back again.
[02:50:42.012 --> 02:50:47.136]  Very, very impressed with the work you're doing in the land of the invisible one that is the book, Dr. Ahmed.
[02:50:47.136 --> 02:50:48.477]  Thank you so much.

[02:51:50.834 --> 02:51:55.297]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:51:55.297 --> 02:51:56.878]  Those times may be near.
[02:51:56.878 --> 02:51:57.439]  Think about it.
[02:51:57.779 --> 02:52:02.381]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:52:02.381 --> 02:52:07.383]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:52:07.383 --> 02:52:13.186]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:52:13.186 --> 02:52:19.889]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.

[02:54:06.118 --> 02:54:09.860]  Some folks are born made to wait to fly.
[02:54:09.860 --> 02:54:10.200]  Ooh!
[02:54:10.200 --> 02:54:14.143]  They're red, white, and blue.
[02:54:14.143 --> 02:54:16.604]  They're red, white, and blue.
[02:54:16.604 --> 02:54:23.508]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief, Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.663]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:54:27.663 --> 02:54:31.186]  Mike Cernovich is coming up with big breaking news.
[02:54:31.186 --> 02:54:38.474]  There's so much we didn't get to today, because there's so much happening, but a lot of it is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:40.442 --> 02:54:47.689]  I never really plugged products today in three hours of broadcast, and we need to fund ourselves, so that's something we need to do.
[02:54:47.689 --> 02:54:56.598]  Plus, we've got great products that I believe could really help you and enrich your life, whether it's spreading the word with an InfoWars t-shirt or getting a bottle of high-quality vitamin B12.
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:00.900]  This is more than a plug right now.
[02:55:00.900 --> 02:55:06.822]  This is an incredible story, but it ties into our products that become a big national issue.
[02:55:06.822 --> 02:55:16.404]  BuzzFeed's lab caught selling relabeled InfoWars product for twice the price.
[02:55:16.404 --> 02:55:27.066]  It's a big lab, but then they also sell products, and then they test them, and then they tell you if they're good, and they said the best vitamin B12 on the market
[02:55:28.548 --> 02:55:31.570]  is vegan B12 brand.
[02:55:31.570 --> 02:55:37.155]  Well, that's who we buy our vitamin B12 from and private label it.
[02:55:37.155 --> 02:55:41.618]  And they sell it for $35.
[02:55:41.618 --> 02:55:46.121]  And we sell it for $17.76.
[02:55:46.121 --> 02:55:50.004]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:55:50.004 --> 02:55:53.287]  And they go on to say our product is completely clean.
[02:55:53.287 --> 02:55:55.488]  Notice they use a California lab.
[02:55:55.488 --> 02:55:57.490]  Highest standards in the world, in California.
[02:55:59.343 --> 02:56:03.666]  Because you better believe if it wasn't California level, there'd be lawyers on top of it.
[02:56:03.666 --> 02:56:09.490]  That's how this works with the testing groups, the lawyers, then the testing groups themselves also sell the products.
[02:56:09.490 --> 02:56:23.739]  Well, we went out and found across the nation the best products out there and private labeled them, or the best products private labeled, bought the raw material, and then had other things added to make it even better with some of our proprietary products.
[02:56:23.739 --> 02:56:28.322]  And this already blew up in their face when they say in the big BuzzFeed hit piece,
[02:56:29.235 --> 02:56:38.803]  It's as advertised, and it is what he says it is, but it's overpriced.
[02:56:38.803 --> 02:56:40.404]  So they would do all this weird stuff.
[02:56:40.404 --> 02:56:48.671]  They would put prices that were higher than we sell stuff, even at regular price there, or they would cherry pick and go, look, this Anthroplex has zinc in it.
[02:56:48.671 --> 02:56:51.073]  They say that $5 worth per bottle, but he sells it for 40.
[02:56:51.073 --> 02:56:54.977]  Actually selling it for less than that, but whatever.
[02:56:54.977 --> 02:56:55.817]  But they don't tell you
[02:56:56.954 --> 02:57:02.655]  It's got all these other ingredients that cost money, and when you add it up, it's like, wow, there's a lot of product in there.
[02:57:02.655 --> 02:57:07.696]  The average supplement company marks things up five times.
[02:57:07.696 --> 02:57:09.397]  We try to keep it at 100%.
[02:57:09.397 --> 02:57:11.017]  Not 500%.
[02:57:11.017 --> 02:57:19.399]  And it's so unethical, though, because they couldn't find anything, so then they just made stuff up.
[02:57:19.399 --> 02:57:19.999]  BuzzFeed did.
[02:57:21.272 --> 02:57:23.313]  Really bizarre how they did it too.
[02:57:23.313 --> 02:57:29.077]  They'd say, we believe he's trying to sell this to cure autism, which is criminal.
[02:57:29.077 --> 02:57:30.478]  And then there's nowhere I said that.
[02:57:30.478 --> 02:57:33.340]  It's bizarre.
[02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:35.101]  I mean, it really is.
[02:57:35.101 --> 02:57:37.522]  But why Sue Buzzfeed are these people?
[02:57:37.522 --> 02:57:38.683]  Because it's a joke.
[02:57:38.683 --> 02:57:40.064]  Now, what do we catch them in?
[02:57:40.064 --> 02:57:42.145]  Here's the big one.
[02:57:42.145 --> 02:57:44.647]  Our Secret 12 is being sold for $17.76 right now.
[02:57:47.153 --> 02:57:49.435]  It's normally $29.95.
[02:57:49.435 --> 02:57:57.600]  That's $5, look right here, $5 when it's a regular price, which it rarely is, than what they're selling it.
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:58.421]  Now what did I tell you?
[02:57:58.421 --> 02:58:05.986]  I said we go out and we buy the top brands, we have them private labeled at their factories, top inspections, all of it.
[02:58:05.986 --> 02:58:07.447]  That's the best thing to do.
[02:58:08.479 --> 02:58:12.182]  And then, if something is usually, you know, $25, we take $5 off of it.
[02:58:12.182 --> 02:58:15.144]  Or if it's $50, we take $10 off.
[02:58:15.144 --> 02:58:24.211]  Exactly as I said, normal price for $5 less than the actual top brand in the country that they certify themselves as the best that they then sell.
[02:58:24.211 --> 02:58:31.957]  But then in the article about ours, say ours is overpriced and should only be $10 when they're selling the exact same thing for $35.
[02:58:31.957 --> 02:58:34.999]  Do they even know that and think I wouldn't notice that?
[02:58:35.939 --> 02:58:37.420]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:37.420 --> 02:58:41.741]  They want to make money while destroying me.

[02:59:39.221 --> 02:59:44.144]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:44.144 --> 02:59:49.628]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:49.628 --> 02:59:54.831]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:54.831 --> 02:59:56.692]  Watch me!
[02:59:56.692 --> 02:59:58.714]  Watch me!
[02:59:58.714 --> 02:59:59.174]  I got it.
[03:00:02.477 --> 03:00:13.546]  All right, Mike Cernovich is uniquely able to talk about this, and I'm going to turn the fourth hour over to him.
[03:00:13.546 --> 03:00:28.517]  Huge intrigue in the White House, North Korean information, the latest on McMaster, so much with one of the top investigative journalists in the country, just a guy who was already a best-selling author about lifestyle until the global is pushing too far, and now just doing an amazing job.
[03:00:29.378 --> 03:00:37.968]  They got democratic parties putting out war game algorithms showing who's most influential and there's Paul Watson, Mike Cernovich, and you see like Eric Trump, Alex Jones.
[03:00:37.968 --> 03:00:44.416]  I mean they got AI computer, when I say that I mean simulation systems, tracking all this and they are really pissed.
[03:00:44.416 --> 03:00:46.719]  So the censorship is all officially hitting.
[03:00:46.719 --> 03:00:48.080]  But they're also trying to cut our funding off.
[03:00:48.701 --> 03:01:00.308]  Cernovich has been working on some high-quality supplements that are really good, but he knows we've even been sending them off and stuff, and talking to some lawyers and consultants about, you know, even tweaking it more, because I said, dude, we are the ultimate target.
[03:01:00.308 --> 03:01:03.369]  We have to be the best in the country.
[03:01:03.369 --> 03:01:03.890]  The best.
[03:01:03.890 --> 03:01:09.813]  That's why everything we've got is, go out, private label, the top sellers that have been around a long time.
[03:01:09.813 --> 03:01:16.617]  Because they say, Jones is selling a lot of really well-known things, as advertised, but he's overcharging.
[03:01:17.813 --> 03:01:22.555]  And then they're selling the same bottle of the company we buy it from for $35.
[03:01:22.555 --> 03:01:24.975]  Vegan B12.
[03:01:24.975 --> 03:01:25.696]  Take it under the tongue.
[03:01:25.696 --> 03:01:27.536]  Methylcobalamin.
[03:01:27.536 --> 03:01:28.817]  Pharmaceutical grade, basically.
[03:01:28.817 --> 03:01:32.178]  I mean, one shot of it's like 50 bucks at the doctor.
[03:01:33.737 --> 03:01:36.079]  I'm not saying inject it, because it's not licensed for that.
[03:01:36.079 --> 03:01:42.903]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that they then get caught at this big lab in California.
[03:01:42.903 --> 03:01:49.248]  They did it there to test us under California law, because we don't, you know, put on there Prop 65 on our bottles.
[03:01:49.248 --> 03:01:51.610]  Meaning, Senators Lori can talk about this.
[03:01:52.685 --> 03:01:57.568]  Meaning that if you don't say, we don't comply with 65, they can sue you and take everything you've got.
[03:01:57.568 --> 03:02:00.809]  So they get us in California, they get our products, they test it.
[03:02:00.809 --> 03:02:02.030]  It's California standards.
[03:02:02.030 --> 03:02:04.531]  They're like, ugh!
[03:02:04.531 --> 03:02:06.552]  And then they go, oh, but it's overpriced.
[03:02:06.552 --> 03:02:09.794]  And they are so stupid that they're selling not one, but two.
[03:02:09.794 --> 03:02:11.515]  We're gonna do another one on this Monday.
[03:02:11.515 --> 03:02:13.116]  It's even better.
[03:02:13.116 --> 03:02:16.638]  The same product at us over double what we are.
[03:02:16.638 --> 03:02:20.780]  Showing we buy from the top brand and then discount it.
[03:02:21.832 --> 03:02:27.337]  Normally 25% right now, it's at 55% off.
[03:02:27.337 --> 03:02:30.601]  Now, Cernovich, how could you make up a scenario better?
[03:02:30.601 --> 03:02:32.903]  The story's on InfoWars.com to embarrass these people.
[03:02:33.823 --> 03:02:47.094]  Well, yeah, I thought it was a great article because as you know, you know, I have been working on very special products and we are, we're at the third level of testing now with a firm where the results are admissible in court.
[03:02:47.094 --> 03:02:49.796]  That's what, you know, we should have talked about this anyway.
[03:02:49.796 --> 03:02:50.557]  We do the same thing.
[03:02:50.557 --> 03:02:51.638]  It takes seven weeks.
[03:02:51.638 --> 03:02:53.459]  We're working with you because I'm looking at working with you.
[03:02:53.459 --> 03:02:54.360]  It's so good.
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:55.041]  So amazing.
[03:02:55.041 --> 03:02:56.422]  And that's what I said.
[03:02:56.422 --> 03:02:58.504]  I said, dude, they're testing everything, but you know our real fear.
[03:02:59.212 --> 03:02:59.673]  Well, I'm sorry.
[03:02:59.673 --> 03:03:00.534]  I don't know what you said on air.
[03:03:00.534 --> 03:03:01.976]  I mean, folks, we're clean.
[03:03:01.976 --> 03:03:02.777]  We use the best.
[03:03:02.777 --> 03:03:04.379]  The problem is... Oh, yeah.
[03:03:04.379 --> 03:03:05.561]  Saboteur.
[03:03:05.561 --> 03:03:14.313]  I mean, the real fear is that Soros is going to hire a factory worker or something, and they'll have a box, and they'll bring in a box and smuggle in Spike product.
[03:03:14.833 --> 03:03:18.959]  Because that would allow them to murder one of your listeners and also to attack.
[03:03:18.959 --> 03:03:22.304]  That's the real fear, but your security is tip-top shape.
[03:03:22.304 --> 03:03:23.565]  You know, nothing like that can happen.
[03:03:23.565 --> 03:03:27.831]  Well, I mean, look, our products are safe, but if it happens, we have their own test saying it's the best ever.
[03:03:27.831 --> 03:03:30.275]  And so, logically, we know who to look for.
[03:03:31.311 --> 03:03:32.032]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:32.032 --> 03:03:36.396]  And that's why the, you know, the offices, everything's super shaped, high security.
[03:03:36.396 --> 03:03:41.382]  It has to be basically a government level security because that's how far they'll go.
[03:03:41.382 --> 03:03:42.743]  But yeah, it is proven now.
[03:03:42.743 --> 03:03:48.009]  That's why, again, you basically have the BuzzFeed seal of approval on your products.
[03:03:48.009 --> 03:03:50.732]  They spent, and by the way, getting this stuff tested,
[03:03:51.753 --> 03:03:54.755]  $1,500 at least for the level I'm doing.
[03:03:54.755 --> 03:03:58.798]  Oh, the reason we have to have markup on the product, it can't be cheaper, is the testing.
[03:03:58.798 --> 03:03:59.638]  We're neurotic.
[03:03:59.638 --> 03:04:02.360]  Three level testing, every batch, we're talking $10,000.
[03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:05.582]  To have triple level testing, $10,000.
[03:04:07.944 --> 03:04:13.927]  Yeah, between the two, Gorilla Mind, each version, we're already at $15,000 into testing.
[03:04:13.927 --> 03:04:21.451]  So BuzzFeed, they probably spent $50,000 in independent testing on your products.
[03:04:21.451 --> 03:04:27.894]  To me, that's pretty amazing that you got now the seal of approval, which is that your products are what they say they are.
[03:04:27.894 --> 03:04:34.457]  And by the way, you know, one thing that I wonder about is, why don't they go test Jeff Bezos products on Amazon?
[03:04:35.097 --> 03:04:37.380]  Why are they testing those products?
[03:04:37.380 --> 03:04:39.143]  Why is everybody going after your product?
[03:04:39.143 --> 03:04:40.865]  And I'll tell you why.
[03:04:40.865 --> 03:04:43.469]  Because you're supported by the listeners.
[03:04:43.469 --> 03:04:44.771]  You're supported by... That's right.
[03:04:44.771 --> 03:04:46.153]  We'll be right back with Mike Cernovich.
[03:04:46.153 --> 03:04:46.634]  Stay with us.
[03:04:49.096 --> 03:05:00.484]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[03:05:00.484 --> 03:05:03.467]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[03:05:03.467 --> 03:05:12.053]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[03:05:12.053 --> 03:05:14.695]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[03:05:14.935 --> 03:05:23.077]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[03:05:23.077 --> 03:05:27.419]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[03:05:27.419 --> 03:05:32.340]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[03:05:32.340 --> 03:05:38.322]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[03:05:38.562 --> 03:05:40.743]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[03:05:40.743 --> 03:05:46.627]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort, when we should be demanding liberty.
[03:05:46.627 --> 03:05:49.388]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:05:49.388 --> 03:05:54.051]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:05:54.051 --> 03:06:06.118]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we
[03:06:06.158 --> 03:06:06.418]  I think?
[03:06:29.659 --> 03:06:37.261]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[03:06:37.261 --> 03:06:40.142]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.

[03:08:07.582 --> 03:08:12.568]  We kick off the Mike Cernovich, Roger Stone, slash Owen Schroer transmission.
[03:08:12.568 --> 03:08:14.530]  It's gonna be a roundtable discussion.
[03:08:14.530 --> 03:08:16.532]  All three men agree that's what they like.
[03:08:16.532 --> 03:08:20.437]  And it's gonna be Owen hosting all three hours every day with Cernovich and, um...
[03:08:22.088 --> 03:08:28.209]  Stone hosting all three if they want, but generally popping in for an hour, hour and a half, two hours, and then having other roundtables.
[03:08:28.209 --> 03:08:37.971]  But Owen will be here in the HD studio kind of maestroing and traffic copying it all, but nobody does better back and forth banner than somebody like Mike Cernovich.
[03:08:37.971 --> 03:08:44.593]  He's got so much big breaking news, but he lets me come on during the fourth hour while we've been warming up for the big syndication.
[03:08:45.713 --> 03:08:54.221]  Usually when you launch a new radio show, and it's not a standard talk show host who's maybe been in retirement but then comes back, people don't pick it up for a few months.
[03:08:54.221 --> 03:08:58.244]  But we've already got dozens and dozens of stations that are looking to pick up.
[03:08:59.150 --> 03:09:07.036]  The new broadcast with Owen Schroyer and Mike Cernovich and all the guys and David Knight because they've been on this show hosting off and on for years.
[03:09:07.036 --> 03:09:09.377]  The case of David for five.
[03:09:09.377 --> 03:09:10.418]  And people know them.
[03:09:10.418 --> 03:09:13.080]  So this is very, very exciting.
[03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:19.725]  And I'm going to feel like I'm a failure if each show doesn't have 50 stations within six months.
[03:09:19.725 --> 03:09:21.866]  I think that's very easy to do.
[03:09:21.866 --> 03:09:24.148]  Some of these are big stations we're on.
[03:09:24.148 --> 03:09:28.050]  I don't mention the stations normally unless I know the owners and know that they
[03:09:29.051 --> 03:09:29.371]  I think
[03:09:49.471 --> 03:09:49.631]  That's
[03:10:10.612 --> 03:10:23.721]  But then it doesn't have all the triple certification and over-the-top stuff and the chain of custody so that absolutely we know we're putting out the cleanest, best, at California standards, that's almost impossible.
[03:10:23.721 --> 03:10:26.804]  Okay, and that's why so many times we have something tested and it's got six, seven ingredients.
[03:10:28.178 --> 03:10:33.684]  One of them will end up having something, even if you source it from the best indoor greenhouses and things.
[03:10:33.684 --> 03:10:40.570]  You've got to grow a lot of herbs now in greenhouses, because the air is so dirty, just to have something that basically is pure.
[03:10:40.570 --> 03:10:40.991]  Okay?
[03:10:40.991 --> 03:10:42.712]  And they make jokes, oh he sells water filters.
[03:10:42.712 --> 03:10:50.220]  We go out and we go, what are the highest spec, quality, gravity-fed filters that cut stuff out to non-detectable levels?
[03:10:52.375 --> 03:10:55.807]  Or in some cases, there's hundreds of chemicals like 99999999.
[03:10:55.807 --> 03:10:57.393]  I mean, that's what my children drink.
[03:10:57.393 --> 03:10:57.955]  It's what I do.
[03:10:59.602 --> 03:11:02.465]  Like you're dumb to not drink filtered water.
[03:11:02.465 --> 03:11:04.526]  You go to any nice restaurant, it's super filtered.
[03:11:04.526 --> 03:11:07.809]  You don't want just a carbon filter either, that just cuts out bad taste.
[03:11:07.809 --> 03:11:09.250]  And they act like this is weird.
[03:11:09.250 --> 03:11:13.413]  When you go to any rich person's house, they're all into this.
[03:11:13.413 --> 03:11:14.313]  That's what's crazy.
[03:11:14.313 --> 03:11:19.217]  Higher educated people have the lowest vaccine levels, the highest levels of taking supplements.
[03:11:19.217 --> 03:11:25.442]  I have countless friends and family that would be crippled by mold and allergies and things if it wasn't for herbs and things they take.
[03:11:26.832 --> 03:11:32.816]  I mean, thank God that aspirin's from plants, marijuana's from plants, most of the drugs are from plants.
[03:11:32.816 --> 03:11:35.958]  They're trying to patent fish oil now, so you can't have that.
[03:11:35.958 --> 03:11:37.579]  The drug companies are.
[03:11:37.579 --> 03:11:39.641]  Of course fish oil's good for your brain.
[03:11:39.641 --> 03:11:47.226]  And then, we're looking to come out with one that's from one of the top places out there, private label, where they're able to extract the mercury out, because there's a little bit of mercury in it.
[03:11:48.826 --> 03:12:00.114]  Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, we're going to the highest levels, because I know when I put out fish oil, they're going to test it, knowing the public's dumb, and go, we found one one-billionth of mercury, even though that's considered totally clean.
[03:12:00.114 --> 03:12:01.676]  It won't pass California standards.
[03:12:01.676 --> 03:12:10.222]  That's why we haven't come out with hundreds of products that we know everybody wants to buy, because we have to make sure each one is stalker-proof.
[03:12:10.222 --> 03:12:12.063]  And then if it isn't stalker-proof, we know
[03:12:13.109 --> 03:12:14.650]  A saboteur's been involved.
[03:12:14.650 --> 03:12:17.931]  And it doesn't just mean get in our factory chain and do something to make somebody sick.
[03:12:17.931 --> 03:12:29.395]  It'd probably be, again, people buying it, taking it to the labs, and if the first five, ten Democrat labs aren't willing to commit crimes, because it's so clean, they're like, it's totally clean, best products out there, somebody's going to say,
[03:12:31.032 --> 03:12:31.912]  Do it yet.
[03:12:31.912 --> 03:12:33.293]  Don't tell me what happened in this test.
[03:12:33.293 --> 03:12:35.654]  I want to hear their side-eyedness.
[03:12:35.654 --> 03:12:35.874]  Okay?
[03:12:35.874 --> 03:12:37.014]  I mean, we know how they operate.
[03:12:37.014 --> 03:12:40.275]  We've already war-gamed it all, and we understand the enemy mind.
[03:12:40.275 --> 03:12:41.236]  Okay?
[03:12:41.236 --> 03:12:41.996]  We understand.
[03:12:41.996 --> 03:12:44.357]  You think you're smart because you're evil and sneaky.
[03:12:44.357 --> 03:12:45.997]  It's because you're dumb.
[03:12:45.997 --> 03:12:47.338]  That's all, like, low-level stuff.
[03:12:47.998 --> 03:12:48.558]  Okay?
[03:12:48.558 --> 03:12:50.719]  That's not what real people do.
[03:12:50.719 --> 03:12:51.820]  It's your evil nature, though.
[03:12:51.820 --> 03:12:52.400]  You can't help it.
[03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:53.921]  So, Mike, I'm going to turn it over to you.
[03:12:53.921 --> 03:12:54.801]  You've got so much to cover.
[03:12:54.801 --> 03:12:58.863]  You've got some big news just broke on Infowars.com dealing with neutron bombs.
[03:12:58.863 --> 03:13:02.225]  Oh, we're even hearing about neutron bombs and how I would use them on North Korea.
[03:13:02.225 --> 03:13:04.586]  If that's what I did use, that's from studying real tactics.
[03:13:04.586 --> 03:13:05.507]  Well, you heard that here first.
[03:13:06.167 --> 03:13:08.869]  Now the word is the neutron bombs are being brought into theater.
[03:13:08.869 --> 03:13:11.831]  I wonder if that's the chicken or the egg story though, because that is the weapons I would personally use.
[03:13:11.831 --> 03:13:20.997]  What they're designed for is in close conflict zones, say of Germany and Eastern Europe with the Russians, if they bunch up and flood in, you don't want to radiate everything permanently.
[03:13:20.997 --> 03:13:26.301]  You don't want to, you know, you should use radiation weapons, which sound like there's more radiation, there's less.
[03:13:26.301 --> 03:13:28.022]  There's like almost 99% less.
[03:13:28.022 --> 03:13:34.147]  It dissipates, but it kills everybody on the surface and down 20, 30 feet, depending on the weapon you use.
[03:13:34.807 --> 03:13:36.668]  And that is the weapon of choice against North Korea.
[03:13:36.668 --> 03:13:38.548]  And people go, well, aren't those illegal?
[03:13:38.548 --> 03:13:39.628]  Yeah, right.
[03:13:39.628 --> 03:13:44.690]  The United States has thousands of directed energy high-yield weapons.
[03:13:44.690 --> 03:13:53.032]  Directed energy weapons and neutron bombs in 1940s design, declassified in the 70s, and Jimmy Carter supposedly outlawed it.
[03:13:53.032 --> 03:13:56.533]  Pureball neutron bomb is the weapon of choice.
[03:13:56.533 --> 03:13:58.054]  And they're now talking about attacking Guam.
[03:13:58.954 --> 03:14:07.806]  Shoot missiles at it that crosses the line and the word is from the folks at CENTCOM and everywhere else is that right now it's locked and loaded is right meaning
[03:14:09.140 --> 03:14:11.042]  Trump's running things, not the globalists.
[03:14:11.042 --> 03:14:14.865]  And he's not going to let them continue to arm North Korea, have them threaten to nuke us.
[03:14:14.865 --> 03:14:17.488]  We're at a very serious time, and I don't want war.
[03:14:17.488 --> 03:14:23.032]  But if we do have a war, North Korea's military has to be destroyed in five minutes.
[03:14:23.032 --> 03:14:27.516]  And the only thing that's going to do it is tactical nuclear weapons and neutron bombs.
[03:14:27.516 --> 03:14:28.117]  Period.
[03:14:28.117 --> 03:14:31.340]  And Russia and China need to be told to sit down and not do anything.
[03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:33.882]  They all helped wind this thing up.
[03:14:33.882 --> 03:14:35.903]  We just dropped bombs on Japan before.
[03:14:36.704 --> 03:14:39.807]  And so everybody just needs to understand this is the real world here.
[03:14:39.807 --> 03:14:47.332]  And Joel Skalzin's an anti-war guy, but he's a former Marine Corps officer, a whole nine yards naval aviator, and he's got the sources, I've got the sources.
[03:14:47.332 --> 03:14:49.794]  Right now, it is very serious.
[03:14:49.794 --> 03:15:00.002]  Now, going back to Cernovich, Mike, the reason I'm making a big deal on this is, and really wanted to butt into your show today, won't be happening while you're doing three hours a day, you'll be asking me to come on, but I mean, you always do, your sweetheart.
[03:15:00.002 --> 03:15:05.086]  This BuzzFeed thing could not have blown up more sickeningly where this big lab
[03:15:06.360 --> 03:15:11.902]  Sits there and tests things that they have already tested for law firms that ask him and others.
[03:15:11.902 --> 03:15:14.182]  And then when they know something's clean, they sell it.
[03:15:14.182 --> 03:15:15.543]  That's kind of a smart model.
[03:15:15.543 --> 03:15:22.785]  And then they're so dumb or thought we wouldn't notice that we buy the best vitamin B12 out there from our research.
[03:15:22.785 --> 03:15:25.706]  This is the one they sell to and say is number one.
[03:15:25.706 --> 03:15:29.467]  And they give five or six others they sell that are almost as good, but less price.
[03:15:29.467 --> 03:15:32.508]  And then they say we're ripping people off when we're selling it for 55%.
[03:15:34.662 --> 03:15:38.973]  Off our regular price, 60% plus off what they're selling it for.
[03:15:38.973 --> 03:15:41.199]  We're selling the exact same bottle.
[03:15:41.199 --> 03:15:42.121]  Everything is different label.
[03:15:43.322 --> 03:15:53.809]  For $17.76, and they're selling it for $35, and they don't know that we didn't know that that's the company that produces this?
[03:15:53.809 --> 03:15:57.271]  Again, to not confuse people, they're selling third-party stuff.
[03:15:57.271 --> 03:16:00.033]  They do the testing to, quote, make sure they're selling good stuff.
[03:16:00.033 --> 03:16:08.539]  Then they did the testing on us, and didn't even understand we were private labeling some of the products they're selling, that they just so happened to say is number one and the cleanest.
[03:16:08.539 --> 03:16:13.242]  And they just done the test and knew what our stuff was, and still kind of came out and said,
[03:16:13.342 --> 03:16:14.588]  Yeah, well, it's a scam.
[03:16:14.588 --> 03:16:16.617]  I mean, this is pretty, uh, you're a lawyer.
[03:16:16.617 --> 03:16:17.441]  What's this look like to you?
[03:16:18.467 --> 03:16:23.190]  Well, actually, they gave you another gift, too, that I don't think a lot of people realized.
[03:16:23.190 --> 03:16:36.339]  Because all of your online activity is traced by these, you know, AI spyware machines, anybody who read that BuzzFeed article and then went to another website would actually see Infobar ads shown up.
[03:16:36.339 --> 03:16:38.981]  So that was amazing free advertising they gave you.
[03:16:38.981 --> 03:16:41.923]  I would write them a check if I were you.
[03:16:41.923 --> 03:16:47.206]  Listen, I don't want to even say, I mean, that's why I've been plugging as much, because we don't usually, we need to plug a lot to get the money in.
[03:16:47.206 --> 03:16:47.727]  This is why
[03:16:48.567 --> 03:16:50.188]  This is like a December 1st day.
[03:16:50.188 --> 03:16:53.449]  That's when we sell the most is in late November, early December for Christmas.
[03:16:53.449 --> 03:16:56.990]  This is like a Christmas day right now for our operation.
[03:16:56.990 --> 03:17:02.972]  I mean, an extra, I'll just tell everybody, an extra $50,000 a day is coming in since this.
[03:17:02.972 --> 03:17:04.173]  I mean, this is like a gift.
[03:17:04.173 --> 03:17:05.433]  I'm not, I can't believe this.
[03:17:05.433 --> 03:17:09.875]  This is, this is going to help us hire more employees, get better equipment, build the studios.
[03:17:10.871 --> 03:17:14.773]  Well, I told you that I think that BuzzFeed, they actually like you at BuzzFeed.
[03:17:14.773 --> 03:17:16.854]  Ben Smith and those guys like you.
[03:17:16.854 --> 03:17:21.376]  So what I think happened is they really like you at BuzzFeed.
[03:17:21.376 --> 03:17:27.279]  So what they wanted to do was promote you, but in a way that the liberals couldn't go, Oh my God, you're promoting Alex Jones.
[03:17:27.279 --> 03:17:28.100]  You're going to normalize him.
[03:17:28.100 --> 03:17:28.940]  That's terrible.
[03:17:28.940 --> 03:17:30.921]  So they go, Hmm, what can we do?
[03:17:30.921 --> 03:17:34.783]  Well, we will give them, we'll put big pictures of all of their products.
[03:17:35.083 --> 03:17:36.784]  So then Charlie Worzel is actually an idiot savant?
[03:17:49.924 --> 03:17:59.607]  I think that they were trying to, BuzzFeed is trying to maybe partner with InfoWars and say, look, we really like what you guys are doing, but we have to, it's like pro wrestling.
[03:17:59.607 --> 03:18:01.727]  They have to be like, well, you know.
[03:18:01.727 --> 03:18:07.148]  Yeah, but that's a little, Daria thinks that's too, but that's a little, I mean, I don't think this lab they got's doing that.
[03:18:07.148 --> 03:18:13.530]  I don't think the lab would be selling the stuff we sell at double the price or more, and then say we're ripping people off.
[03:18:13.530 --> 03:18:15.291]  I mean, I don't, it's just, it's crazy.
[03:18:15.291 --> 03:18:16.631]  But nobody went that far though.
[03:18:17.131 --> 03:18:17.932]  Nobody reads that.
[03:18:17.932 --> 03:18:21.293]  All people do when they read those articles, they look at the pictures.
[03:18:21.293 --> 03:18:29.158]  So all anybody, you know, because my background, as you said earlier in the show, is my background was lifestyle, marketing, mindset kind of stuff.
[03:18:29.158 --> 03:18:38.563]  So I know that when you read those articles, people just see picture, picture, picture, InfoWars, Survival Shield, Anthroplex, Caveman, DNA Force.
[03:18:38.563 --> 03:18:40.244]  That's all that registers in their mind.
[03:18:40.244 --> 03:18:42.405]  I was about to say, but we got a bigger kick off this
[03:18:42.625 --> 03:18:43.426]  We're good to go.
[03:18:59.002 --> 03:19:04.324]  I wouldn't just sell 5,000 different supplements and not then know that they were all great for my listeners.
[03:19:04.324 --> 03:19:05.585]  Oh, but what does Whole Foods do?
[03:19:05.585 --> 03:19:06.645]  They say, that's not our problem.
[03:19:06.645 --> 03:19:07.525]  We're reselling it.
[03:19:07.525 --> 03:19:08.766]  They don't test any of it.
[03:19:08.766 --> 03:19:17.029]  It's okay for Bezos, as you said, to just flood Amazon, flood everywhere, flood Whole Foods with the very best, the very worst, and not even care, and that's okay.
[03:19:17.029 --> 03:19:24.252]  But then me, I put out stuff that all passes California standards and is more than half the price of what they're selling it for, and I'm a bad person.
[03:19:24.992 --> 03:19:29.974]  We're making $5 a bottle at $17.76 on our B12.
[03:19:29.974 --> 03:19:32.795]  They're making $20.
[03:19:32.795 --> 03:19:33.495]  It's great though.
[03:19:33.495 --> 03:19:40.278]  That's the beauty of it all is that they give you, John Oliver's giving you free publicity, free promotion.
[03:19:40.278 --> 03:19:48.521]  You know, there's a great Schwarzenegger quote I like which is that, pity you get for free, hate you have to earn, jealousy you have to learn, you have to earn.
[03:19:48.521 --> 03:19:52.843]  So you're earning the hatred and jealousy of them and every time they go after you or they go after me,
[03:19:53.383 --> 03:20:00.586]  You know, the Deep State now, half of my notifications now are just Deep State lying about me and fabricating things and editing videos now.
[03:20:00.586 --> 03:20:05.309]  And to me, people are like, oh my God, Cernovich, have you seen this?
[03:20:05.309 --> 03:20:10.951]  And I go, don't bring up that nonsense to me because I want them to edit my videos.
[03:20:10.951 --> 03:20:12.572]  I want them to get my message out.
[03:20:12.572 --> 03:20:14.533]  I don't care what they're saying about me.
[03:20:14.533 --> 03:20:18.235]  I want them to push the image because that is just more people saying my face.
[03:20:18.235 --> 03:20:19.055]  I was about to say though,
[03:20:19.915 --> 03:20:23.676]  The Deep State is not saying we should be put in prison because they love us.
[03:20:23.676 --> 03:20:30.237]  And so I think obviously in pop culture, you're right, there's kind of a love-hate with BuzzFeed, because they know they get record publicity when they talk about us.
[03:20:30.237 --> 03:20:31.618]  You know, they would die without us.
[03:20:31.618 --> 03:20:34.158]  So I mean, I get that it's all backhanded stuff.
[03:20:34.158 --> 03:20:41.200]  But with Deep State, you know, like this high-level CIA bureaucrat that ran the torture programs, ran the CIA takeover of the FBI.
[03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:42.980]  I mean, he is super bad.
[03:20:42.980 --> 03:20:44.980]  Put in by the Clintons, put in by Mueller.
[03:20:44.980 --> 03:20:46.281]  Just horrible.
[03:20:46.281 --> 03:20:48.141]  This Mudd guy, his name's Mudd.
[03:20:48.741 --> 03:20:52.743]  Going on CNN as an analyst saying we're going to kill Trump.
[03:20:52.743 --> 03:20:54.744]  I mean Trump needs to do something.
[03:20:54.744 --> 03:20:55.444]  This is illegal.
[03:20:55.444 --> 03:20:59.546]  Talking about killing a head of state and he is the kind of guy that actually does that.
[03:21:00.424 --> 03:21:07.649]  I mean, so what's amazing is, I mean, this, again, it's like a child molester moves in next door, he's been convicted three times, and he says, I'm gonna rape your daughter.
[03:21:07.649 --> 03:21:10.891]  Not mud, I'm saying hypothetically, you know, this is an analogy.
[03:21:10.891 --> 03:21:15.515]  And then, you see him chasing your daughter around, you know, with his pants down.
[03:21:15.515 --> 03:21:17.456]  I mean, it's clear and present danger.
[03:21:17.456 --> 03:21:24.761]  This is a guy that does this stuff, that overthrows, that kills people, that runs operations to do this, and he's saying, we're gonna kill Trump.
[03:21:24.761 --> 03:21:27.904]  Oh, and by the way, I'm gonna go over, he said, I'm gonna physically attack
[03:21:28.644 --> 03:21:31.005]  Uh, Gowdy, Trey Gowdy for exposing Hillary.
[03:21:31.005 --> 03:21:34.246]  He said, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, you know, chain him up and kick his teeth out.
[03:21:34.246 --> 03:21:39.147]  I mean, I mean, this guy is a raving piece of garbage.
[03:21:39.147 --> 03:21:48.330]  Well, have you told people about how there's that parking spot where if you go over in that little area by your studio, all cell phone reception, it's like a miniature EMF device or something?
[03:21:48.330 --> 03:21:48.590]  Yes.
[03:21:48.590 --> 03:21:49.610]  I didn't believe it at first.
[03:21:49.610 --> 03:21:51.191]  And then my phone, nobody's phone works.
[03:21:51.191 --> 03:21:53.372]  So yeah, there's clearly a lot of stuff like that.
[03:21:53.372 --> 03:21:54.572]  The door clickers don't work?
[03:21:55.248 --> 03:21:55.829]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:21:55.829 --> 03:21:56.410]  No, no.
[03:21:56.410 --> 03:21:59.496]  It's like a miniature EMF where door clickers don't work.
[03:21:59.496 --> 03:22:01.439]  Phones don't work in this little area.
[03:22:01.439 --> 03:22:02.361]  So who knows?
[03:22:02.361 --> 03:22:03.283]  Who knows what they have there?
[03:22:03.283 --> 03:22:03.764]  But you're right.
[03:22:03.764 --> 03:22:04.786]  There's a difference between.
[03:22:05.746 --> 03:22:06.306]  We're good to go!
[03:22:26.758 --> 03:22:36.705]  If I'm ever by myself, I'm only in the hotel, I'll only eat in the hotel, I'll only drink wine in the hotel, because if somebody roofies me, there'll be cameras everywhere, and that'll be the only thing that'll save me.
[03:22:36.705 --> 03:22:40.648]  But I told you, I mean, it happened to me three years ago.
[03:22:40.648 --> 03:22:43.590]  I definitely got roofied, and I barely made it to my bed.
[03:22:43.590 --> 03:22:48.774]  I walked home, and I was just, I mean, it was like, I'd had like one drink, and it was like, whoa.
[03:22:48.774 --> 03:22:53.657]  And it's good, and like, right as I come out, there's this creepy looking, you know, taxi, hey, wanna get in?
[03:22:53.657 --> 03:22:54.378]  It was weird.
[03:22:55.444 --> 03:23:02.872]  Yeah, no, that's what the kind of ops they're doing where they keep trying to hit you and discredit you and do character assassination.
[03:23:02.872 --> 03:23:09.239]  When that doesn't work, their last resort is to hack your computer, plant stuff on your computer, or to frame you.
[03:23:09.239 --> 03:23:11.882]  That's right, the next thing is child porn.
[03:23:11.882 --> 03:23:12.763]  Yep.
[03:23:12.763 --> 03:23:13.784]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[03:23:14.741 --> 03:23:15.401]  That's what they'll do.
[03:23:15.401 --> 03:23:19.622]  Yeah, they'll play it on your computer and then they'll say, oh, they found it or whatever.
[03:23:19.622 --> 03:23:20.543]  So that's the game.
[03:23:20.543 --> 03:23:22.603]  Well, let me ask you this then.
[03:23:22.603 --> 03:23:23.743]  Because you have a lot of great sources.
[03:23:23.743 --> 03:23:24.304]  So do we.
[03:23:24.304 --> 03:23:27.084]  They tell me we're winning in the CIA, FBI.
[03:23:27.084 --> 03:23:34.927]  I mean, hell, when I was at the RNC, it was like the Secret Service was high-fiving us and didn't care if they were on camera and gave us intel on Hillary.
[03:23:34.927 --> 03:23:38.788]  And just there's a total turning against the globalists.
[03:23:38.788 --> 03:23:39.548]  It's still there.
[03:23:40.508 --> 03:23:46.531]  They're trying to organize with Clapper and Brennan on TV and Mudd, the killing of the President.
[03:23:46.531 --> 03:23:51.513]  I think they're trying to act confident to get the deep state to organize with them to kill Trump.
[03:23:51.513 --> 03:23:56.436]  I think the deep state, which has always been there, they tried to deny that exists, you know, but now they admit it.
[03:23:56.436 --> 03:23:58.277]  I think the deep state's actually against them, Mike.
[03:23:58.277 --> 03:24:00.057]  I think that's why they're so scared.
[03:24:00.057 --> 03:24:01.558]  Well, that's the only thing I've been told.
[03:24:01.558 --> 03:24:03.499]  That's the only thing keeping us alive.
[03:24:03.499 --> 03:24:08.281]  Because there are enough people in there that if they really try to... That's why I was told.
[03:24:08.281 --> 03:24:09.262]  Who do you think told me
[03:24:10.288 --> 03:24:10.989]  You never be alone.
[03:24:28.047 --> 03:24:30.049]  That's why I periscope and everything.
[03:24:30.049 --> 03:24:34.354]  I have an alibi for everywhere that I am because I'm on Twitter.
[03:24:34.354 --> 03:24:36.636]  That's why people go, why do you periscope so much?
[03:24:36.636 --> 03:24:44.545]  Well, because then if I disappear for five or six hours, people will know that I must've got roofied or kidnapped or something, and they'll know to be on the lookout.
[03:24:44.545 --> 03:24:47.588]  So what we're doing is we're creating a record now.
[03:24:47.888 --> 03:24:53.671]  The media will go, oh, Jones claims they want to kill Trump, he's crazy, and then it's all over the news a week later, and they admit they want to get us.
[03:24:53.671 --> 03:24:59.054]  I mean, I talked to the President, folks, I send him memos, they know that now, so I can just say it on air.
[03:24:59.054 --> 03:25:01.055]  And you talk to a lot of high-level folks.
[03:25:01.055 --> 03:25:02.836]  So, we have sources they don't have.
[03:25:02.836 --> 03:25:12.761]  Yes, we're in the James Bond movie, we don't think we're cool like James Bond, we're just citizens fighting hard, we don't want to be slaves, but folks have to understand the magnitude of the position that a Matt Drudge or a
[03:25:13.061 --> 03:25:19.774]  Paul Joseph Watson or a Mike Cernovich or even mid-level folks out there are in.
[03:25:19.774 --> 03:25:22.419]  This is real, folks, and imagine where Trump sits.
[03:25:22.419 --> 03:25:23.240]  Let me ask you the question again.
[03:25:24.602 --> 03:25:26.203]  Trump has a responsibility.
[03:25:26.203 --> 03:25:27.884]  The Attorney General has a responsibility.
[03:25:27.884 --> 03:25:32.707]  When you've got Brennan and Clapper saying, we're organizing him to be removed in the next few months.
[03:25:32.707 --> 03:25:35.708]  You've got Al Gore saying it three nights later on Late Late Show.
[03:25:35.708 --> 03:25:38.250]  You've got Mudd saying, we're getting ready to kill him.
[03:25:38.250 --> 03:25:39.530]  You've got him everywhere else saying it.
[03:25:39.530 --> 03:25:43.773]  That's clearly, they should all be SWAT teamed, drug in.
[03:25:43.773 --> 03:25:46.054]  Everything they've got should be looked at.
[03:25:46.054 --> 03:25:48.355]  You know they're plotting it on TV.
[03:25:48.355 --> 03:25:51.017]  You know the plans to commit
[03:25:52.247 --> 03:25:57.715]  Capital murder assassination of the President of the United States is going to be all over.
[03:25:57.715 --> 03:25:59.838]  But it's so radical they're doing it.
[03:25:59.838 --> 03:26:02.703]  It's like no one wants to even talk about it because it's so crazy.
[03:26:02.703 --> 03:26:05.006]  But now Hannity and everybody else is talking about it.
[03:26:05.006 --> 03:26:06.188]  I think they've miscalculated.
[03:26:07.549 --> 03:26:34.341]  Yeah, again, what I thought was interesting, a number, I mean, there's so much going on, I mean, we could talk for 10 hours, but one of the, because a lot of people don't know, we never talk on the phone, so it's like we're catching up when we're doing these shows, because we're both so busy, you know, with, because everybody's coming at you, like I said, triple testing, any kind of product, GMP, made in the USA, you gotta triple certify everything, we're just too busy to even talk to each other, and the thing to notice is that Jay Tapper tweeted out
[03:26:34.901 --> 03:26:36.942]  He was very upset that Mike Flynn Jr.
[03:26:36.942 --> 03:26:39.644]  retweeted Paul Joseph Watson, Jim Hoft, and me.
[03:26:39.644 --> 03:26:46.007]  So that is actually drawing the fire of Jake Tapper, who, as we know, was CIA operative and is a deep state.
[03:26:46.007 --> 03:26:50.149]  And then McMaster, it came out again in another foreign policy article.
[03:26:50.149 --> 03:26:53.551]  McMaster, it remains obsessed with Mike Cernovich.
[03:26:53.551 --> 03:26:56.352]  He continues to freak out about me.
[03:26:56.352 --> 03:26:59.094]  So now three articles, Bloomberg, Eli Lake,
[03:26:59.554 --> 03:27:03.077]  The Atlantic, Rosie Gray, and now Foreign Policy.
[03:27:03.077 --> 03:27:04.158]  I forget who wrote that article.
[03:27:04.158 --> 03:27:08.782]  We now have three independent articles saying that McMaster is obsessed with me.
[03:27:08.782 --> 03:27:10.784]  He viewed me, they called me a specter.
[03:27:10.784 --> 03:27:15.528]  That I was this, like, ghost-like apparatus that he lives in fear of.
[03:27:15.528 --> 03:27:22.894]  And so that shows, that's why the support of the list... And by the way, they've got a big hit team on Homeland Security that the National Security Advisor runs.
[03:27:24.015 --> 03:27:25.876]  Again, we're not trying to say, hey, we're tough guys here.
[03:27:25.876 --> 03:27:27.217]  We're fighting the war.
[03:27:27.217 --> 03:27:30.159]  And these guys all have armies of killers at their disposal.
[03:27:30.159 --> 03:27:32.001]  And they might have too many drinks one night and pull the trigger.
[03:27:32.001 --> 03:27:35.123]  And hey, if that happens, we're not losers if we get killed.
[03:27:35.123 --> 03:27:35.823]  OK?
[03:27:35.823 --> 03:27:36.524]  We chose this.
[03:27:36.524 --> 03:27:36.884]  We're doing it.
[03:27:36.884 --> 03:27:37.885]  We're going to beat them.
[03:27:37.885 --> 03:27:42.448]  In the end, everybody just keep moving forward because they can't get us all.
[03:27:42.448 --> 03:27:47.711]  I'm just saying, when you go against someone like Mudd that ran the torture programs and all these deals, these people think they're God.
[03:27:47.711 --> 03:27:48.952]  And they're not.
[03:27:48.952 --> 03:27:52.275]  This country is not here to be used as your own private toilet paper.
[03:27:52.275 --> 03:27:52.655]  Go ahead.
[03:27:53.826 --> 03:27:54.787]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:27:54.787 --> 03:28:12.040]  But that's how high the stakes are now where, you know, the National Security Advisor is, they monitor, by the way, Ricky Waddell, who's a deputy, they monitor every time we go on air, they monitor them, they download them, and they send it into their FBI laboratory for body language analysis to try to figure out who our sources are.
[03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:12.581]  So they'll say,
[03:28:12.981 --> 03:28:17.466]  They'll say, oh, how does he gesticulate when they talk about Trump or Don Jr.?
[03:28:17.466 --> 03:28:28.277]  And they're creating, using all kinds of deep learning software, they're creating programs about us so that then when they watch the shows, the computer is going to analyze it to try to find out... And it's so ridiculous!
[03:28:28.277 --> 03:28:30.959]  Who do you think we're talking to when we say highest level?
[03:28:30.959 --> 03:28:32.821]  I mean, it's not hard to figure out.
[03:28:33.742 --> 03:28:34.283]  It's ridiculous.
[03:28:34.283 --> 03:28:35.524]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:28:35.524 --> 03:28:37.566]  They don't have any kind of understanding.
[03:28:37.566 --> 03:28:41.510]  They've also sent in people with disinformation campaigns online.
[03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:43.232]  It is getting dirty.
[03:28:43.232 --> 03:28:44.774]  They're definitely playing dirtier than ever.
[03:28:44.774 --> 03:28:45.775]  But what are they going to do?
[03:28:45.775 --> 03:28:48.137]  Because it's only helping everybody.
[03:28:48.137 --> 03:28:49.298]  That's why they're wanting to kill Trump.
[03:28:49.298 --> 03:28:50.560]  They just don't know what to do.
[03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:52.502]  They're beating their head up against a wall.
[03:28:53.615 --> 03:29:01.680]  Well, yeah, and what I've told people, and I've told deep state people who have reached out to me for a rational risk assessment, and I go, you got 30 million people.
[03:29:01.680 --> 03:29:07.925]  I told them, even if Trump had a heart attack by natural causes, there are 30 million gun owners in America who won't believe that.
[03:29:07.925 --> 03:29:10.066]  So you people have better be careful.
[03:29:10.066 --> 03:29:17.211]  If anything, you need to make sure that he's taking his... I was about to say, I know you got a guest coming up, but let me ask you this question for you to answer when you come back, and I'm gone now.
[03:29:18.684 --> 03:29:21.506]  What does Mudd think when he's saying we're going to kill the president?
[03:29:21.506 --> 03:29:24.288]  If he gets killed now, what's going to happen to Mudd?
[03:29:24.288 --> 03:29:26.489]  I mean, Mudd, you are Mudd.
[03:29:26.489 --> 03:29:31.192]  I mean, you guys have really... No one's ever acted like these people.
[03:29:31.192 --> 03:29:33.273]  If you were going to kill the president, you'd try to do it.
[03:29:33.273 --> 03:29:37.556]  You wouldn't shoot your little mouth off, hoping somebody else did it.
[03:29:37.556 --> 03:29:38.937]  We're on the march.
[03:29:38.937 --> 03:29:41.478]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:41.478 --> 03:29:44.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:49.195 --> 03:29:56.181]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[03:29:56.181 --> 03:30:01.685]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[03:30:01.685 --> 03:30:05.028]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[03:30:05.028 --> 03:30:07.389]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[03:30:07.389 --> 03:30:12.714]  And how do we remove that power from Washington, to our local communities, to the individual?
[03:30:12.714 --> 03:30:14.575]  That is the ultimate concern.
[03:30:14.575 --> 03:30:16.837]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[03:30:16.937 --> 03:30:20.700]  It was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[03:30:20.700 --> 03:30:23.202]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[03:30:23.202 --> 03:30:27.506]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[03:30:27.506 --> 03:30:32.269]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[03:30:32.269 --> 03:30:37.654]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[03:30:37.654 --> 03:30:42.698]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[03:30:42.999 --> 03:30:46.713]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[03:30:46.713 --> 03:30:48.561]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:49.147 --> 03:30:51.028]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:30:51.028 --> 03:30:53.048]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:30:53.048 --> 03:30:55.969]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:55.969 --> 03:31:02.031]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:02.031 --> 03:31:11.214]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:11.214 --> 03:31:13.415]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself,
[03:31:13.695 --> 03:31:18.743]  Your co-workers, your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:18.743 --> 03:31:26.795]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:26.795 --> 03:31:27.756]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:28.957 --> 03:31:32.901]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:32.901 --> 03:31:36.465]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:36.465 --> 03:31:43.172]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:43.172 --> 03:31:47.357]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[03:31:49.662 --> 03:31:54.327]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:31:54.327 --> 03:32:05.759]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition.
[03:32:05.819 --> 03:32:06.099]  I think?
[03:32:23.194 --> 03:32:23.854]  We're good.
[03:33:00.180 --> 03:33:04.549]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:04.549 --> 03:33:08.436]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:33:10.307 --> 03:33:10.867]  I can't help it.
[03:33:10.867 --> 03:33:14.208]  I just got to continue hogging all the air time here with Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec.
[03:33:14.208 --> 03:33:15.548]  Both guys have so much energy.
[03:33:15.548 --> 03:33:18.089]  I just get energy when I'm even talking to them.
[03:33:18.089 --> 03:33:25.050]  And I'm sure Posobiec is going to be on the Roundtable Show whenever Cernovich or Roger Stone want to have him on.
[03:33:25.050 --> 03:33:27.671]  And down the road, I plan to watch.
[03:33:27.671 --> 03:33:30.971]  By the end of next year, 18 hours a day live.
[03:33:30.971 --> 03:33:33.592]  Then we're going to go 24-hour basic news, but with the TV.
[03:33:35.152 --> 03:33:35.733]  We're good to go.
[03:33:53.226 --> 03:34:02.351]  Drudge linked our story last Friday, that was the number one story over the weekend, about Savage coming out saying, hey, if they start a revolution, if they kill Trump, we're going to kick their ass.
[03:34:02.351 --> 03:34:03.571]  Now, I'm not calling for that.
[03:34:03.571 --> 03:34:04.452]  He's not calling for it.
[03:34:04.452 --> 03:34:15.858]  It's what you were saying, and that's why I held over, and I want to ask both of you this, that I am going to go, what happens if one of their lone nuts kills him, or he has a heart attack for real, as much as he's working?
[03:34:15.858 --> 03:34:16.998]  No one is going to believe it.
[03:34:16.998 --> 03:34:19.620]  I don't want violence, but here's the deal, if they do kill Trump,
[03:34:21.758 --> 03:34:24.239]  I mean, I'm not somebody that shoots my mouth off about fiscal stuff.
[03:34:24.239 --> 03:34:26.860]  I feel like I need to protect the President.
[03:34:26.860 --> 03:34:27.580]  This is America.
[03:34:27.580 --> 03:34:30.662]  This is like George Washington Part II, the way he's really trying to deliver.
[03:34:30.662 --> 03:34:32.662]  Uphill battle and winning and being demonized.
[03:34:32.662 --> 03:34:34.063]  They're trying to kill him.
[03:34:34.063 --> 03:34:37.084]  I mean, I feel angry at people saying kill him.
[03:34:37.084 --> 03:34:41.946]  I feel like they shouldn't be able to live in this man's world where they don't stick their neck out.
[03:34:41.946 --> 03:34:45.408]  They just sit around, you know, running their mouth and nobody ever does anything to them.
[03:34:46.408 --> 03:34:56.553]  Let me tell you something, in the past, if you're in the government and you have the expertise of killing people, and that's what you've done, and then you start talking about killing the president, you're dead that day you die in your shower.
[03:34:56.553 --> 03:34:59.594]  I mean, you're, boom, no thought.
[03:34:59.594 --> 03:35:02.836]  That's what those hit teams are for, is stuff like that.
[03:35:02.836 --> 03:35:06.058]  And I just, I can't believe that they're that arrogant.
[03:35:06.058 --> 03:35:08.639]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[03:35:10.168 --> 03:35:20.519]  Former high-level CIA saying, we're going to kill the President soon, and then we're going to go grab Gowdy and chain him up and knock his teeth out.
[03:35:20.519 --> 03:35:25.364]  You think people like Gowdy and everybody wants that Star Citizen to be waiting for him to come knock our teeth out?
[03:35:25.364 --> 03:35:30.310]  You're letting us know you want to get us all chained up, like you do for fun after the...
[03:35:31.876 --> 03:35:36.237]  I guess, you know, like we're tied up in some coffin and you come in there like deliverance and get your power trip off.
[03:35:36.237 --> 03:35:39.478]  Because believe me, guys like this Mudd guy don't do the torturing and killing.
[03:35:39.478 --> 03:35:43.939]  They just get off on watching the videos of it and the bean counting of it.
[03:35:43.939 --> 03:35:49.660]  And now Mudd, who's in all these torture investigations, now we're like zooming in on him and see how he likes that.
[03:35:49.660 --> 03:35:51.980]  These people, they're just crazy!
[03:35:51.980 --> 03:35:54.201]  Cernovich, takeover, Pacific takeover.
[03:35:55.669 --> 03:35:56.609]  I don't want violence.
[03:35:56.609 --> 03:35:57.930]  Those that are violent first lose.
[03:35:57.930 --> 03:35:58.851]  We're winning intellectually.
[03:35:58.851 --> 03:36:01.252]  But that's why they're mad trying to do this.
[03:36:01.252 --> 03:36:06.334]  But you can't just go on CNN and say, we're going to kill the president.
[03:36:06.334 --> 03:36:11.196]  That's not like some crazy guy in his apartment who doesn't even have a BB gun saying that.
[03:36:11.196 --> 03:36:16.439]  This is like a dangerous guy with connections to killers saying, we're going to kill the president.
[03:36:16.439 --> 03:36:18.139]  I mean, I have the responsibilities as an American.
[03:36:18.139 --> 03:36:19.000]  I'm not going to do anything.
[03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:21.842]  Because obviously, it'd take a long time and a lot of other things.
[03:36:21.842 --> 03:36:23.283]  I would never break the law, of course.
[03:36:23.283 --> 03:36:28.006]  I'm saying I instinctively feel like I should be going and doing something myself.
[03:36:28.006 --> 03:36:29.127]  And I'm not just saying that.
[03:36:29.127 --> 03:36:29.907]  We built this.
[03:36:29.907 --> 03:36:30.608]  We're doing something.
[03:36:30.608 --> 03:36:31.829]  I'm not saying I'm going to do it.
[03:36:31.829 --> 03:36:34.270]  I'm saying, this guy says he's going to kill my president.
[03:36:34.270 --> 03:36:35.891]  He's got the wherewithal to do it.
[03:36:35.891 --> 03:36:38.693]  He looks all crazy when he's saying it.
[03:36:38.693 --> 03:36:45.138]  And I'm just like, as an American, I mean, you know, and there are a lot of people more serious than me that are close to him.
[03:36:45.138 --> 03:36:46.479]  Does he have any idea?
[03:36:47.455 --> 03:36:52.779]  Like if I had odds on this, I guarantee you I'm not going to do anything violent because I don't want to be blamed for it.
[03:36:52.779 --> 03:36:58.343]  I don't think this guy, unless things go the way he thinks they are, I think there's canoeing accidents in this guy's future.
[03:36:58.343 --> 03:36:58.944]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:36:58.944 --> 03:37:00.525]  What do you think?
[03:37:00.525 --> 03:37:06.870]  I thought it was interesting how Jake Taper immediately knew the guy had said too much and he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:37:07.685 --> 03:37:08.806]  That's not what you really meant.
[03:37:08.806 --> 03:37:15.288]  So if anybody, if I had said, you know what, we're going to kill Hillary Clinton, Jay Taper would be like, oh my God, I can't believe it.
[03:37:15.288 --> 03:37:17.409]  Murderers, Trump people, murderers.
[03:37:17.409 --> 03:37:23.552]  So Jay Taper actually was like, whoa, whoa, you weren't supposed to tell people about our plot to assassinate the president.
[03:37:23.552 --> 03:37:24.913]  You know, CNN is ISIS.
[03:37:24.913 --> 03:37:27.214]  This goes back to everything's coming together.
[03:37:27.214 --> 03:37:27.854]  Jay Taper.
[03:37:28.434 --> 03:37:32.495]  Should have said, I disavow, this is terrible, you're not allowed here.
[03:37:32.495 --> 03:37:44.038]  But meanwhile, some idiot like Jeffrey Lord makes a satirical Hitler comment, which everybody knew that he was trying to say that, you know, Jeffrey Lord of CNN got fired because he goes, oh, seek hail.
[03:37:44.038 --> 03:37:46.799]  But he was saying that's what the media matters people do.
[03:37:46.799 --> 03:37:50.360]  He's saying they're cult-like Nazi followers.
[03:37:50.360 --> 03:37:55.622]  So are we going to boycott Stanley Kubrick because he made fun of Dr. Strangelove with, I can walk.
[03:37:58.228 --> 03:38:02.099]  Right, or anybody with a Hitler costume.
[03:38:02.099 --> 03:38:05.549]  Alright, you guys got stuff to cover, but just real fast, what is your view on this?
[03:38:06.678 --> 03:38:17.688]  Yeah Alex, my take on it is that what they're trying to do here is normalize the idea of the deep state taking out Trump or of people normalizing more further violence against Trump supporters.
[03:38:17.688 --> 03:38:28.537]  We saw this in Pennsylvania this week where a rabid anti-Trumper, this Democrat activist, shot his Republican committeeman neighbor twice in the head in front of the guy's wife.
[03:38:28.817 --> 03:38:32.381]  And then the national media has been completely silent on this story.
[03:38:32.381 --> 03:38:35.804]  Why won't they talk about violence, murder at this point, against Trump?
[03:38:35.804 --> 03:38:45.493]  That's right, they stir it up, they push it, and then when it happens, they don't cover it but intensify, going, it's working, it's working, thinking they're going to intimidate all of us.
[03:38:45.493 --> 03:38:47.195]  All they're doing is giving us more energy.
[03:38:47.195 --> 03:38:48.136]  Don't they understand that?
[03:38:49.904 --> 03:38:51.745]  I don't think they do understand it, Alex.
[03:38:51.745 --> 03:39:00.932]  Remember, this is the same people that last year, when President Trump was talking about supporting the Second Amendment, they all ran around for the week saying that he called to assassinate Hillary Clinton.
[03:39:00.932 --> 03:39:04.795]  Trump said, oh, I support the Second Amendment, the Second Amendment people, and they said, aha!
[03:39:04.795 --> 03:39:06.456]  Trump has said he's going to assassinate Hillary.
[03:39:06.456 --> 03:39:09.818]  They ran fake news for weeks and weeks based off of that.
[03:39:09.818 --> 03:39:16.663]  But now we've got a guy here on CNN who literally said, kill the president, when Jake Taper- He said, we're going to kill him!
[03:39:16.843 --> 03:39:23.368]  He said, we're setting it up to kill him, and he's the guy at the CIA that used to set it up for overthrowing countries!
[03:39:23.368 --> 03:39:26.030]  I mean, it's like a brain surgeon saying, I'm gonna do brain surgery.
[03:39:26.030 --> 03:39:29.873]  He's up there, this is what he does, this is a dangerous person!
[03:39:31.104 --> 03:39:32.525]  This is how they train these people.
[03:39:32.525 --> 03:39:33.705]  That's how they train them to think.
[03:39:33.705 --> 03:39:35.486]  That's how they train them to operate.
[03:39:35.486 --> 03:39:54.377]  This is what the type of people we have, not only dealing in the highest levels of some of these black teams in our intelligence community, but also at the same levels in academia, in the Beltway, the Department of Defense, and you're seeing it as well at CNN, which is actually, I'm sitting here in Atlanta, just a few blocks away from people
[03:39:54.397 --> 03:39:54.817]  Believe it or not.
[03:39:54.817 --> 03:39:57.541]  I know you guys have the Google protests and other stuff, so go ahead and take over.
[03:39:57.541 --> 03:39:59.002]  I just love being with you guys.
[03:39:59.002 --> 03:40:00.324]  Again, Jack Posobiec is with us as well.
[03:40:00.324 --> 03:40:01.245]  Follow him on Twitter.
[03:40:01.245 --> 03:40:02.766]  Follow him on Facebook.
[03:40:02.766 --> 03:40:06.150]  And people say, well then why are you bashing YouTube, Facebook and Twitter but staying on it?
[03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:07.111]  Paul is his own man.
[03:40:07.111 --> 03:40:08.133]  He's decided to leave YouTube.
[03:40:08.133 --> 03:40:09.314]  I called him this morning.
[03:40:09.314 --> 03:40:12.397]  He said, listen, if they keep censoring my videos, I'm never going back.
[03:40:13.298 --> 03:40:15.059]  I want to make a point that people need to recognize.
[03:40:28.971 --> 03:40:32.153]  The YouTube didn't create content.
[03:40:32.153 --> 03:40:37.776]  They obtained Paul Joseph Watson's labor under false pretenses underlying.
[03:40:37.776 --> 03:40:43.559]  They said, come to our platform, link to people, bring people to here because we don't have anything but you.
[03:40:43.559 --> 03:40:44.900]  Paul had a following.
[03:40:44.900 --> 03:40:46.041]  We bring them the following.
[03:40:46.901 --> 03:40:47.862]  Exactly.
[03:40:47.862 --> 03:40:50.964]  So now YouTube is so big, they go, oh, but we don't need you.
[03:40:50.964 --> 03:40:54.206]  It's kind of like that person that you help out in life and you build up.
[03:40:54.206 --> 03:40:56.047]  They're saying, we don't need you!
[03:40:56.047 --> 03:40:58.328]  YouTube says, we don't need you anymore!
[03:40:58.328 --> 03:41:01.510]  We're now, we're now Globalistube!
[03:41:01.510 --> 03:41:03.211]  Right, but he built them up.
[03:41:03.211 --> 03:41:07.834]  Paul Joseph Watson gave them tens of millions of dollars in free advertising.
[03:41:07.834 --> 03:41:09.575]  So he needs to just make them, kill them.
[03:41:09.575 --> 03:41:13.037]  And that is why, Alex, you should do a march on Google in Austin.
[03:41:13.037 --> 03:41:14.498]  That's what we're going to talk to Jack about.
[03:41:15.126 --> 03:41:15.606]  Yeah.
[03:41:15.606 --> 03:41:17.768]  We need a march on Google in Austin.
[03:41:17.768 --> 03:41:19.229]  That can be yours.
[03:41:19.229 --> 03:41:20.571]  We're doing them nationwide.
[03:41:20.571 --> 03:41:21.591]  We need big marches.
[03:41:21.591 --> 03:41:22.452]  I'm going to support.
[03:41:22.452 --> 03:41:23.253]  I'm going to cover live.
[03:41:23.253 --> 03:41:24.214]  I'm going to send reporters.
[03:41:24.214 --> 03:41:24.834]  You just tell us.
[03:41:24.834 --> 03:41:27.436]  You're with Infowars now as a correspondent.
[03:41:27.436 --> 03:41:30.439]  We're going to have you as soon as we get organized because we're just already fighting so hard.
[03:41:30.439 --> 03:41:33.341]  It's kind of like one of our future development leaders, Cernovich.
[03:41:33.341 --> 03:41:35.443]  I've just got to work out the deal to bring Cernovich.
[03:41:35.443 --> 03:41:36.484]  That's about money, though.
[03:41:36.484 --> 03:41:40.027]  He just wants to, I mean, I just want to team up with everybody, magnify everyone.
[03:41:40.027 --> 03:41:40.687]  That's what we're going to do.
[03:41:40.687 --> 03:41:42.809]  We're all going to amplify each other and defeat the enemy.
[03:41:43.894 --> 03:41:47.416]  Right, so let's talk about the March on Google and brainstorm it then.
[03:41:47.416 --> 03:41:57.822]  Jack Posobiec is planning it and organizing it, and while you're here, why don't you just add your feedback too, and then we can figure out the way to have the biggest impact meme contest.
[03:41:57.822 --> 03:42:06.908]  I'm sponsored with $10,000 of my journalism fund for meme contests and things like that, to just encourage people to participate in the journalism.
[03:42:06.908 --> 03:42:08.589]  Well, I'll tell you what, if you'll manage
[03:42:09.149 --> 03:42:16.435]  The account and the email do has 500 videos now with me trying to go through this on our contest with the music song.
[03:42:16.435 --> 03:42:18.476]  We're going to have to put that off a few weeks to even announce the winner.
[03:42:18.476 --> 03:42:22.939]  So we just show all the videos and give them the respect they deserve and try to judge them.
[03:42:22.939 --> 03:42:28.223]  How about, because I did the CNN thing with $200,000, but then it was so hard for folks to get live on CNN.
[03:42:28.223 --> 03:42:30.045]  We only paid out like 70 grand of that.
[03:42:30.045 --> 03:42:31.346]  We just paid out 20 on another deal.
[03:42:32.446 --> 03:42:37.568]  Jack, how about for InfoWars, if I give you access to the email that contests at InfoWars, we create a new one.
[03:42:37.568 --> 03:42:42.430]  How about a big prize, like how about $50,000 and then you can manage it.
[03:42:42.430 --> 03:42:47.072]  You're better at this stuff than I am at actually working 80 hours a day and actually, because I'm just overwhelmed right now.
[03:42:47.072 --> 03:42:49.193]  How about $50,000 prize?
[03:42:49.193 --> 03:42:50.954]  How about a two-week limit so it's quick?
[03:42:51.374 --> 03:43:10.829]  We're videos that are legal and lawful, where you expose internet censorship, free-for-all, as long as you plug InfoWars, as long as you plug the different activists, as long as you show what we're doing, and showing that there's a Chinese-style net censorship coming, and that they've used their public utility trust to now cheat everybody.
[03:43:10.829 --> 03:43:13.011]  How about a $50,000 contest?
[03:43:13.011 --> 03:43:14.072]  How about you come up with it?
[03:43:14.072 --> 03:43:15.753]  You and Posobiec, how about you guys manage it?
[03:43:16.926 --> 03:43:19.767]  Yeah, that's a perfect, perfect project for Jack, yeah.
[03:43:19.767 --> 03:43:24.209]  So, he's leading the march and he, you know, that's a great idea, Alex.
[03:43:24.209 --> 03:43:24.649]  Absolutely.
[03:43:24.649 --> 03:43:36.514]  How about 50,000 for whoever legally flies helicopters over Google exposing it, or, you know, airdrops of pamphlets, or projecting stuff on their walls, or going to their public events and speaking to them, or, you know, whatever it is to get through.
[03:43:36.514 --> 03:43:37.034]  Is it just Google?
[03:43:37.034 --> 03:43:40.235]  Yeah, Alex, they're not even having, they're not even having public events anymore.
[03:43:40.235 --> 03:43:45.497]  They were going to have an event yesterday where they were going to discuss what happened to James D'Amore, this guy who got fired.
[03:43:45.897 --> 03:43:50.119]  And so I went to Twitter and I said, hey, and I would say this was without even the contest.
[03:43:50.119 --> 03:43:55.141]  I said, hey, if anybody is reading my Twitter within the sound of my voice and is going to be there, can you get pictures?
[03:43:55.141 --> 03:43:55.982]  Can you get audio?
[03:43:55.982 --> 03:43:57.262]  Tell us what's going on.
[03:43:57.262 --> 03:44:01.524]  At least get us a report of what's going on inside Google behind their closed doors.
[03:44:01.524 --> 03:44:05.406]  The minute they did that, they completely shut down the entire event.
[03:44:05.406 --> 03:44:06.747]  There was no discussion.
[03:44:06.747 --> 03:44:08.087]  There was nobody allowed in or out.
[03:44:08.087 --> 03:44:10.728]  And they said because they were worried that people were going to leak it.
[03:44:10.728 --> 03:44:13.030]  Well, I'm sorry, Google, you're in our data.
[03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.990]  You're in our emails.
[03:44:14.210 --> 03:44:20.335]  You're reading all of our conversations, but with the minute we try to shine a light on what you guys are up to, they immediately shut it down.
[03:44:20.335 --> 03:44:29.262]  So I would even add, Alex, the idea that if someone is within Google and is willing to tell us what exactly is going on behind those closed doors... Well, that's it.
[03:44:29.262 --> 03:44:36.948]  They need to start leaking to us because this is a foreign intelligence body, bigger than our government, allied with radical Islam, destroying our culture.
[03:44:36.948 --> 03:44:38.790]  You know, that's a great point that
[03:44:40.305 --> 03:44:44.129]  They've tried to censor over and over again and have always tried to back off if you're eating around the edges.
[03:44:44.129 --> 03:44:52.479]  They're pushing, all of them together, all the big platforms together, are pushing together right now to normalize this and if it's successful, how bad will it get, Cernovich?
[03:44:52.479 --> 03:44:53.981]  Because, I mean, they're clearly moving right now.
[03:44:55.151 --> 03:45:00.713]  Oh no, that's the thing is, if they, here's why they want to remove us from social media.
[03:45:00.713 --> 03:45:07.275]  Right now, if we were framed for a crime, or murdered, or they do a hit job, we go on social media and respond.
[03:45:07.275 --> 03:45:18.798]  So what they're doing is, they want to target us for assassination, and if we're banned from social media, and we're killed, and the media doesn't cover it, nobody will even know, the people won't even know, and then they'll ban everybody who talks about.
[03:45:18.798 --> 03:45:21.779]  So no, no, this is a setup for targeted assassinations.
[03:45:22.299 --> 03:45:25.542]  On anybody who is speaking out against the evil that's being done.
[03:45:25.542 --> 03:45:28.865]  And by the way, Mike Cernovich is not being a drama queen here.
[03:45:28.865 --> 03:45:30.507]  He is totally on target.
[03:45:30.507 --> 03:45:35.452]  The globalists funded the Arab Spring that killed over a million innocent people, most of them Christians.
[03:45:35.452 --> 03:45:38.354]  The globalists failed states to bring down Africa.
[03:45:38.354 --> 03:45:46.843]  The globalists are ruthless and raid pension funds of old people and public utilities and police funds and firefighting funds and old folks homes.
[03:45:48.035 --> 03:45:49.637]  They're totally psychopathic.
[03:45:49.637 --> 03:45:54.582]  Soros, one of their top guys, was a Nazi collaborator when he was a teenager.
[03:45:54.582 --> 03:45:59.627]  They support China and forced abortions and suicide nets and hell on earth.
[03:45:59.627 --> 03:46:01.008]  They support radical Islam.
[03:46:01.008 --> 03:46:08.096]  So, the only reason they haven't done all this yet is because they couldn't get away with it because American values said no.
[03:46:08.096 --> 03:46:09.677]  And they're using leftist garbage now.
[03:46:10.538 --> 03:46:15.402]  To try to just get this in place long enough to have a purge, kill Trump and kill us.
[03:46:15.402 --> 03:46:19.706]  So make no mistake, what he's saying is true and that's exactly why I asked the question.
[03:46:19.706 --> 03:46:26.151]  We've gone to this point and they're accelerating it all because they're about to make their move.
[03:46:26.151 --> 03:46:31.335]  That's why we've got to have maximum effort now on every front to kick their butt.
[03:46:31.335 --> 03:46:33.377]  I was really upset on election night.
[03:46:34.522 --> 03:46:41.185]  And BuzzFeed got it wrong when they said Jones was upset that Trump got in because he'd make less money or whatever.
[03:46:41.185 --> 03:46:44.667]  I was upset because I knew the real war had just started.
[03:46:44.667 --> 03:46:49.210]  I was glad Trump got in, but then I realized now they're really gonna go crazy.
[03:46:49.210 --> 03:46:53.012]  I was upset like somebody getting ready for a death battle.
[03:46:53.012 --> 03:46:58.715]  Like, knowing I gotta go in the arena now and the monster coming out of that pit is gonna be five times bigger.
[03:46:58.715 --> 03:47:00.996]  So I was just basically kissing my kids goodbye.
[03:47:01.616 --> 03:47:09.202]  And because I'd already war-gamed it all out, now we've had this victory, and now America being saved, yet again, we've made it that much sweeter.
[03:47:09.202 --> 03:47:13.785]  And it made me sick to realize that if more people would just wake up, we wouldn't have to go down this road.
[03:47:13.785 --> 03:47:14.345]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:47:14.345 --> 03:47:14.826]  Go ahead, guys.
[03:47:14.826 --> 03:47:16.007]  And I am going to leave now.
[03:47:16.007 --> 03:47:16.207]  Go ahead.
[03:47:17.458 --> 03:47:19.599]  Yeah, if Hillary had won, I just would have left the country.
[03:47:19.599 --> 03:47:22.680]  I wouldn't because I knew I would know that would be over.
[03:47:22.680 --> 03:47:30.262]  So in a way, my life would be easier because if Hillary had won, I just would have left the country, moved to Hungary, maybe moved to Buenos Aires.
[03:47:30.262 --> 03:47:35.703]  And because I'd realized if I stayed in the country, they would just take me out and then they would leave me alone because I was gone.
[03:47:35.703 --> 03:47:38.964]  So Trump winning actually made my life far more dangerous.
[03:47:38.964 --> 03:47:39.565]  Now with H.R.
[03:47:39.565 --> 03:47:44.186]  McMaster holding multiple meetings about me confirmed by three different independent
[03:47:44.426 --> 03:47:46.647]  That's why I love Cernovich.
[03:47:46.647 --> 03:47:47.867]  We're synced, man.
[03:47:47.867 --> 03:47:49.887]  I knew, like, oh my God.
[03:47:49.887 --> 03:47:55.989]  We're winning, that's great, but it was the responsibility of knowing that this was total commitment now.
[03:47:55.989 --> 03:47:57.549]  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of other things.
[03:47:57.549 --> 03:48:07.432]  I could be having your charcuterie and wine in Buenos Aires, you know, if Hillary had won, and now I just deal with people lying about me, smearing me, people who claim to be my friends, stabbing me in my back.
[03:48:07.432 --> 03:48:12.533]  My life is way more difficult than it would be because now the war ratcheted up, because now they're flipping
[03:48:13.114 --> 03:48:13.414]  Thank you.
[03:48:28.843 --> 03:48:29.703]  Yeah, thanks Mike.
[03:48:29.703 --> 03:48:47.070]  So, what we already started is, we realized that with Google, it's such a large company, it's such a huge pervasive search engine, it's in so many aspects of our lives, that originally we thought we were just going to do something right up at the Mountain View complex, that Googleplex that everybody knows about.
[03:48:47.070 --> 03:48:55.713]  But then, as it got expanded, people started really saying, hey Jack, you know what, there's Google offices in almost every single large city in the United States, there's even some international.
[03:48:56.053 --> 03:48:58.915]  So people are saying... Well, that's when we war game live on air!
[03:48:58.915 --> 03:49:01.317]  With Mike, I just said, hey, Google's got a big office here, too!
[03:49:01.317 --> 03:49:02.218]  They've got them everywhere!
[03:49:02.218 --> 03:49:03.599]  You've got one in Austin, right?
[03:49:03.599 --> 03:49:03.799]  Two!
[03:49:03.799 --> 03:49:08.382]  They've got the big one downtown, and then another one in the Hill Country.
[03:49:08.382 --> 03:49:09.423]  Well, that's what we have to do.
[03:49:09.423 --> 03:49:13.526]  We've got to divide and conquer, because, yeah, Google's huge, but what can we do?
[03:49:13.526 --> 03:49:15.688]  There are still going to be more of us than there are of them.
[03:49:15.688 --> 03:49:18.790]  So yesterday, we just announced the first five cities.
[03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:23.634]  We're going to be doing Mountain View, officially, up in the San Francisco area, as well as
[03:49:24.494 --> 03:49:25.534]  Austin, Texas.
[03:49:25.534 --> 03:49:26.755]  Boston, Massachusetts.
[03:49:26.755 --> 03:49:27.675]  New York City.
[03:49:27.675 --> 03:49:28.655]  Washington, D.C.
[03:49:28.655 --> 03:49:35.457]  We've probably got about two more or three more people that have reached out to me with points of contact that say, hey, we've got big groups.
[03:49:35.457 --> 03:49:36.558]  We want to get out there.
[03:49:36.558 --> 03:49:40.719]  We want our voice heard against these people because it's been too long that Google is being tried.
[03:49:40.719 --> 03:49:43.139]  Nothing against patriots going to bars and having meet and greets.
[03:49:43.139 --> 03:49:44.740]  And that's all about having a social culture.
[03:49:45.060 --> 03:49:48.484]  Everybody coming together, very diverse crowds, good people, a lot of fun.
[03:49:48.484 --> 03:50:00.979]  Going out and marching, and not just going to the Antifa strongholds, but going to Google where they're totally freaked out and just laughing and exposing them and shooting videos that you then put online scares them because they're scared of human.
[03:50:00.979 --> 03:50:02.421]  They're scared of human action.
[03:50:04.625 --> 03:50:06.386]  Yeah, they've been triggered, Alex.
[03:50:06.386 --> 03:50:17.312]  We saw the article today that came out that somebody was going around in Venice Beach, outside the Google offices there, putting up signs that say, you know, Apple, think different, Google, not so much.
[03:50:17.312 --> 03:50:22.695]  Right up at the bus stations, you know, a little joke, kind of a meme sign, like a prank, and they were losing their minds over this.
[03:50:22.695 --> 03:50:25.176]  There were people who were stopping there, they had the Gula
[03:50:25.196 --> 03:50:26.237]  Well, it's funny you say that.
[03:50:26.237 --> 03:50:35.825]  Our plan is, with a bunch of big outfits that create these big street art stickers you put up legally and lawfully, so it's not spray paint you peel them off, is we're going to run a bunch of stuff against Google all over town.
[03:50:35.825 --> 03:50:41.629]  You know, talking about how they help folks get arrested so they can be, you know, killed in Pakistan and Facebook as well.
[03:50:41.629 --> 03:50:42.951]  Why just go after Google, though?
[03:50:42.951 --> 03:50:44.672]  Shouldn't we go after Facebook, Twitter, and everybody else?
[03:50:44.672 --> 03:50:49.236]  I mean, I get this targeted ones about Google, but I guess later we should also go against everybody else.
[03:50:50.203 --> 03:50:52.284]  This isn't going to be a one-day campaign, Alex.
[03:50:52.284 --> 03:50:53.564]  We're going to start it with Google.
[03:50:53.564 --> 03:50:58.746]  I think we should definitely go forward with the other ones in a time-staggered manner.
[03:50:58.746 --> 03:51:00.286]  Absolutely.
[03:51:00.286 --> 03:51:04.488]  Yeah, Google's hot because of the James Damore firing the diversity memo.
[03:51:04.488 --> 03:51:09.730]  So, as you know, whenever there's a wave, you want to ride that wave rather than create your own wave.
[03:51:09.730 --> 03:51:18.993]  You know, as a thinker and as an expert, you want to make waves, but if somebody else has made a wave, which Google has done... You make waves and you jump waves.
[03:51:19.813 --> 03:51:20.394]  Exactly.
[03:51:20.394 --> 03:51:22.436]  So Google has made two waves.
[03:51:22.436 --> 03:51:26.419]  One is YouTube has created what I call the YouTube Ghetto.
[03:51:26.419 --> 03:51:33.906]  And the YouTube Ghetto, just like during World War II, you know, Hitler would put Jews over in ghettos, private areas, put stars on them.
[03:51:33.906 --> 03:51:41.112]  The YouTube now, they're saying, well, if you're a dissident thinker, you have to go in this little ghetto and we're going to flag it and we're not going to let people talk.
[03:51:41.112 --> 03:51:43.835]  It's very Nazi-like tactics coming from the left because
[03:51:44.595 --> 03:51:50.597]  Nazism was a collectivist movement, and what we're seeing now with the social justice is... And it's exactly the same!
[03:51:50.597 --> 03:51:55.619]  They go after little accounts first, then the medium, then the big ones, and the big ones are like... They even tell you.
[03:51:55.619 --> 03:51:58.960]  One time I had Facebook, like, a major Facebook exec would like to meet you.
[03:51:58.960 --> 03:52:00.581]  Stop making waves and we'll promote you.
[03:52:00.581 --> 03:52:03.682]  As soon as I didn't, cut off our... They were like 30% of our traffic.
[03:52:03.682 --> 03:52:05.542]  When they did that, they went to like 10%.
[03:52:05.542 --> 03:52:10.284]  So this is how they do it, and they even tell you, come to this party, work with us, and we'll stop doing it.
[03:52:10.284 --> 03:52:12.325]  We think we work, you know, all this money for you.
[03:52:12.866 --> 03:52:18.564]  But then once they get you to go along with shutting everybody else off, then they can get you and there's nobody there to stand up for you.
[03:52:20.234 --> 03:52:20.894]  Exactly right.
[03:52:20.894 --> 03:52:23.315]  So that's why the march on Google first.
[03:52:23.315 --> 03:52:26.296]  But we need to start going to the executives' homes.
[03:52:26.296 --> 03:52:37.700]  It is 100% legal for people to find out where Google executives live and knock on their neighbors' doors and say, hey, why is it that Google promotes pedophilia, but they're banning conservative thinkers?
[03:52:37.700 --> 03:52:42.742]  Why do they ban Christians and pro-Christian thinkers, but they allow pedophiles to use their platforms?
[03:52:42.742 --> 03:52:44.042]  And here's pedophiles.
[03:52:44.042 --> 03:52:47.463]  So they don't even know what is going to be unleashed.
[03:52:47.463 --> 03:52:49.424]  This march on Google is like one op.
[03:52:49.744 --> 03:52:52.466]  But eventually we're going to start going to their homes and knocking on their doors.
[03:52:52.466 --> 03:52:53.727]  Sure, it's about the detonator.
[03:52:53.727 --> 03:52:55.569]  This is the detonator.
[03:52:55.569 --> 03:53:15.325]  My sources as well within Google and even in public have been talking a little bit more about what Eric Schmidt, Cernovich, I know you know about this, the fact that Eric Schmidt, the original founder, that this is a guy who lives an open marriage with his wife, he's involved with Burning Man, he's involved with all sorts of stuff that's been going on at times in the past, he's been involved with people that were
[03:53:16.065 --> 03:53:21.610]  Yeah, what we're gonna be doing is, if they really want to ratchet it up, what we're gonna do is we're going to go into their personal lives.
[03:53:41.220 --> 03:53:42.221]  Which is what Google does.
[03:53:42.221 --> 03:53:44.984]  I mean, we just lost Aaron Rich's feed.
[03:53:44.984 --> 03:53:50.330]  They get in our lives, they have cars going around that are robot, grabbing our data, breaking into our computers.
[03:53:50.330 --> 03:53:52.532]  They were allowed to by Obama.
[03:53:52.532 --> 03:53:53.713]  And that's where Trump's missed the boat.
[03:53:53.713 --> 03:53:57.157]  And Trump's great, but he is 71, and I don't know a lot about computer stuff, but I know about the basics.
[03:54:00.270 --> 03:54:09.299]  Was so scared of him at first, but then because all these people, you know, hang out from his campaign with him and Google's kind of patted him on the head, they're trying to get rid of Trump because they know he may wake up any moment.
[03:54:09.299 --> 03:54:16.506]  He's got all the power in the world to stop them from what they're doing, but instead they're just, they're trying to destroy him and Trump's doing nothing about it.
[03:54:17.708 --> 03:54:23.930]  Yeah, and Alex, one of the dirty little secrets of Google is the Obama administration and Google employees, they were staffers.
[03:54:23.930 --> 03:54:25.190]  It was like a revolving door.
[03:54:25.190 --> 03:54:27.291]  You were working in the White House, then you were back at Google.
[03:54:27.291 --> 03:54:29.751]  You were a lobbyist for Google, and then you were in the White House.
[03:54:29.751 --> 03:54:39.074]  So many of the legislation, so much stuff that went through FCC, like net neutrality rules during the Obama administration, they were written directly by Google executives.
[03:54:39.074 --> 03:54:42.875]  And we're going to expose this, the way that Google has gotten in bed with our government.
[03:54:43.135 --> 03:54:47.898]  And the Libertarians, I love Libertarians, but they're saying, hey guys, this is a private company.
[03:54:47.898 --> 03:54:52.500]  No, they worked with the government to take everything over and are now shutting down our speech.
[03:54:52.500 --> 03:54:54.241]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[03:54:54.241 --> 03:54:55.342]  No, you're exactly right though.
[03:54:55.342 --> 03:54:57.062]  It's because this is a different situation.
[03:54:57.062 --> 03:55:00.084]  This is not just a private company operating on its own.
[03:55:00.084 --> 03:55:02.565]  If it were, then hey, you know what, it's a free country.
[03:55:02.565 --> 03:55:04.807]  But they're in bed with our government, they're regulating us.
[03:55:04.807 --> 03:55:08.989]  And it's got political groups like the ADL in there as their censorship brain.
[03:55:10.942 --> 03:55:20.226]  Right, so the collusion that's been going on between them, the Democrat Party, the federal government, the FCC, it's all intertwined and that's what we need to expose.
[03:55:20.226 --> 03:55:24.187]  This isn't the 1800s when companies were off doing their own thing anymore.
[03:55:24.187 --> 03:55:27.748]  They've all intertwined and they've learned how to game the system to their favor.
[03:55:27.748 --> 03:55:28.589]  They're beyond the government!
[03:55:28.589 --> 03:55:29.889]  And that's what we're marching against.
[03:55:29.889 --> 03:55:32.330]  Even the Guardian says it's an authoritarian takeover.
[03:55:32.330 --> 03:55:33.711]  Even real liberals say that.
[03:55:33.711 --> 03:55:34.031]  Cernovich?
[03:55:35.253 --> 03:55:36.814]  Yeah, no, you're 100% right.
[03:55:36.814 --> 03:55:40.755]  And there's also the antitrust issues that nobody wants to talk about.
[03:55:40.755 --> 03:55:43.136]  Google and YouTube are now monopolies.
[03:55:43.136 --> 03:55:47.438]  They don't have... So we have to talk about antitrust regulation against Google.
[03:55:47.438 --> 03:55:51.160]  There's a lot of... Here's the big problem they made, Alex, strategically, okay?
[03:55:51.946 --> 03:55:58.929]  Tech is one of the few industries in America that engages in shady practices, but Americans love tech.
[03:55:58.929 --> 03:56:02.111]  They've now waged war against half of the country.
[03:56:02.111 --> 03:56:04.392]  They have no idea the implications on that.
[03:56:04.392 --> 03:56:07.673]  They're no longer seen as the white knights or the white hat people.
[03:56:07.673 --> 03:56:11.735]  They're now being seen as people who are fully entering the culture war.
[03:56:12.415 --> 03:56:14.456]  Not in the white knight Buck Rogers thing.
[03:56:14.456 --> 03:56:14.956]  We love you.
[03:56:14.956 --> 03:56:18.157]  We're going to leave you alone because you're Americana and our best thing is tech.
[03:56:18.157 --> 03:56:20.158]  We know you're allied with radical Islam.
[03:56:20.158 --> 03:56:22.739]  We know you're in bed with China with suicide nets at your factories.
[03:56:22.739 --> 03:56:28.021]  We know you're jerks that have gotten all the wealth of America and now want to piss in our faces and it's not going to happen.
[03:56:28.021 --> 03:56:30.682]  You're going to get leaked on just like when they're trying to shut me down.
[03:56:30.682 --> 03:56:31.482]  You got the documents.
[03:56:31.482 --> 03:56:33.203]  They admitted they were real backed off real quick.
[03:56:34.263 --> 03:56:36.885]  And we just want them to get out of the way!
[03:56:36.885 --> 03:56:37.785]  Have your trillions!
[03:56:37.785 --> 03:56:38.646]  Have all your women!
[03:56:38.646 --> 03:56:40.326]  Have your helicopters and jets!
[03:56:40.326 --> 03:56:43.908]  Just stop trying to screw us over!
[03:56:43.908 --> 03:56:47.250]  Yeah, go be degenerate and have your drugs!
[03:56:47.250 --> 03:56:49.571]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:56:49.571 --> 03:56:51.292]  Go ahead, Jack.
[03:56:51.292 --> 03:56:53.974]  What's the message with these marches?
[03:56:53.974 --> 03:56:54.894]  What's our final message?
[03:56:54.894 --> 03:56:57.455]  Our message is, let us live our lives.
[03:56:57.455 --> 03:56:58.796]  We're not going to shut you down.
[03:56:58.796 --> 03:57:00.097]  We don't want you to shut us down.
[03:57:00.097 --> 03:57:00.477]  Period.
[03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:06.996]  Yeah, they're the ones coming after us!
[03:57:06.996 --> 03:57:14.464]  You know, there is a danger though, just like MySpace and stuff, won't they extinct themselves and force the real organic web that's bigger away from them?
[03:57:16.423 --> 03:57:19.824]  Yeah, like I said, they didn't think this through.
[03:57:19.824 --> 03:57:21.625]  They haven't war-gamed it outright.
[03:57:21.625 --> 03:57:25.546]  All they're doing now is inviting, for example, there's something called a double Irish.
[03:57:25.546 --> 03:57:33.528]  It's a major tax dodge that Facebook and these tech companies do where they claim that their revenue was in Ireland and they got fined $10 billion by the EU.
[03:57:33.528 --> 03:57:35.109]  It's offshoring tax avoidance.
[03:57:35.851 --> 03:57:40.652]  Yeah, so I've been ranting about this for five years, like, why is this allowed?
[03:57:40.652 --> 03:57:45.593]  Nobody cared because, oh, if you're conservative, you should care about these multi-trillion dollar tech companies.
[03:57:45.593 --> 03:57:48.574]  Well, now we're going to try to close these tax loopholes.
[03:57:48.574 --> 03:57:49.734]  We're going to go after them.
[03:57:49.734 --> 03:57:52.775]  Antitrust, FCC, taxes.
[03:57:52.775 --> 03:57:54.575]  It's going to be a full frontal attack on it.
[03:57:54.575 --> 03:57:55.835]  And that's what they've welcomed.
[03:57:55.835 --> 03:57:57.596]  And people like me have been waiting.
[03:57:57.596 --> 03:57:59.376]  Let's be clear.
[03:57:59.376 --> 03:58:02.057]  Google's got something like $300 billion offshore we know of.
[03:58:02.057 --> 03:58:03.317]  Apple, even more.
[03:58:03.317 --> 03:58:03.777]  Bezos.
[03:58:04.517 --> 03:58:08.421]  And then they're like telling middle class people our taxes should be higher.
[03:58:08.421 --> 03:58:09.762]  They're just horrible.
[03:58:09.762 --> 03:58:12.525]  They run the worst death factories in China.
[03:58:12.525 --> 03:58:13.926]  They're not even liberals.
[03:58:13.926 --> 03:58:19.612]  They are horrible fascist scum who think they're going to destroy America and it's not going to happen.
[03:58:19.612 --> 03:58:21.754]  Mike Cernovich, Jack Posobiec, you guys are amazing.
[03:58:21.754 --> 03:58:25.778]  Everybody should go to your website, support what we're doing and be part of this big Google march.
[03:58:25.778 --> 03:58:27.139]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:27.139 --> 03:58:27.980]  with the Sunday Transmission.
[03:58:30.805 --> 03:58:34.772]  You guys are invited on if you want to come on, both of you.
[03:58:34.772 --> 03:58:36.475]  Everybody, retweet everything we're doing.
[03:58:36.475 --> 03:58:37.196]  It's an emergency.
[03:58:39.111 --> 03:58:39.591]  Not a group.
[03:58:39.591 --> 03:58:41.072]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:58:41.072 --> 03:58:42.372]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:58:42.372 --> 03:58:43.592]  Why is this so good?
[03:58:43.592 --> 03:58:48.873]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:58:48.873 --> 03:59:02.417]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:59:02.417 --> 03:59:03.777]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:59:04.557 --> 03:59:06.197]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:59:06.197 --> 03:59:08.778]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:59:08.778 --> 03:59:10.078]  These are all parasites.
[03:59:10.078 --> 03:59:11.198]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:59:11.198 --> 03:59:12.519]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:59:12.519 --> 03:59:17.019]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:59:17.019 --> 03:59:20.280]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:59:20.280 --> 03:59:23.381]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:59:23.381 --> 03:59:24.421]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:59:24.421 --> 03:59:26.341]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:59:26.341 --> 03:59:27.381]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:59:27.381 --> 03:59:30.082]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:59:30.082 --> 03:59:30.282]  And, uh,
[03:59:30.942 --> 03:59:31.983]  You support the broadcast.
[03:59:31.983 --> 03:59:33.324]  Infowarslives.com.
[03:59:33.324 --> 03:59:35.586]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:59:35.586 --> 03:59:42.111]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:59:42.111 --> 03:59:44.733]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
