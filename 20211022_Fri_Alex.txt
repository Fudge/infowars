[00:00.000 --> 00:27.680]  Having the data from millions of cases over several weeks, nearly a third of all COVID cases
[00:27.680 --> 00:34.480]  in the UK, the data is clear. The so-called COVID vaccines are slowly killing people.
[00:35.040 --> 00:41.520]  The latest vaccine surveillance reports published by Public Health England show what we've already
[00:41.520 --> 00:48.320]  been hearing from doctors worldwide. The mRNA jabs are destroying people's immune systems,
[00:48.880 --> 00:56.240]  and it seems to be happening gradually over time, especially for the doubly vaccinated between 40
[00:56.240 --> 01:02.720]  and 70 years old. They have already lost over 40 percent of their immune system capability,
[01:02.720 --> 01:10.320]  and are losing an additional 5 percent every week. At this rate, by Christmas, we will have
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.560]  zero percent immune system capability in all doubly vaccinated people over 40,
[01:16.560 --> 01:21.840]  and by March, everyone over 30 will have lost their immune systems as well.
[01:21.840 --> 01:28.400]  Over time, it appears that those aged 30 and younger are also seeing a degradation of their
[01:28.400 --> 01:34.800]  immune systems. It's normal for this age group to have a more vigorous immune system, so perhaps
[01:34.800 --> 01:42.400]  it does a better job fighting off the debilitating mRNA jabs at first. Time will tell, but the data
[01:42.400 --> 01:50.320]  shows a very difficult and dark winter lies ahead. And we've heard this before. Dr. Ryan Cole,
[01:50.320 --> 01:57.040]  a pathologist who has conducted over 100,000 COVID-19 lab tests, has also found that the
[01:57.040 --> 02:03.520]  mRNA shots are causing serious autoimmune disorders. And Dr. David Bauer, one of the top
[02:03.520 --> 02:09.360]  virologists running this so-called vaccine program in the UK, confirms all of this.
[02:09.360 --> 02:15.280]  We've found that recipients of the Pfizer vaccine, those who've had two doses, have about
[02:15.280 --> 02:20.800]  five to six-fold lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies, which block the virus from getting
[02:20.800 --> 02:26.560]  into your cells in the first place. We've also found that for people with only one dose of the
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.000]  Pfizer jab, that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies in their blood.
[02:32.560 --> 02:37.600]  And perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward is that we see that the older you are,
[02:38.160 --> 02:43.040]  the lower your levels are likely to be, and the time since you've had your second jab,
[02:43.040 --> 02:48.320]  as that time goes on, the lower your levels are also likely to be. And actually says that
[02:48.320 --> 02:53.440]  having a regular booster shot will be some kind of remedy. So that's telling us that we're probably
[02:53.440 --> 02:58.720]  going to be needing to prioritize boosters for older and more vulnerable people. Like a monthly
[02:58.720 --> 03:05.280]  subscription service to stay alive. Let us not forget how all of this was started by the communist
[03:05.280 --> 03:12.000]  Chinese, how they already recovered from COVID and are now flaunting military power, threatening
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.560]  the borders of Taiwan and India. In the book Unrestricted Warfare, published in America
[03:18.560 --> 03:24.560]  20 years ago, officers of the communist Chinese military recognize that it's impossible to
[03:24.560 --> 03:31.600]  challenge the U.S. in a conventional military arena and explain how the only way to conquer America
[03:31.600 --> 03:36.480]  would be through deception, so that the public never knew they were under attack.
[03:36.480 --> 03:42.880]  They described how they could accomplish this by flooding the U.S. with illicit drugs to demoralize
[03:42.880 --> 03:50.640]  us, infiltrating and subverting the stock markets, the judicial system, and the media. Seizing control
[03:50.640 --> 03:58.000]  of vital natural resources and creating a fake natural disaster using biological weapons. And
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.560]  finally, take down the entire electrical information grid to cause social panic, street riots, and a
[04:06.560 --> 04:13.360]  political crisis. With over a third of the population suffering from complete immune failure,
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.440]  taking down the grid this winter would be devastating. Now is the time to brace yourself
[04:19.440 --> 04:29.440]  for what's coming. For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:49.440 --> 05:08.560]  The technocrats, the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists, they're all part of the same
[05:08.560 --> 05:15.680]  satanic, globalist, control-free system that seeks to play God, that seeks to turn the general
[05:15.680 --> 05:23.040]  population of this earth into their slaves, into putty, into clay in their hands that they control.
[05:23.840 --> 05:29.040]  And chief amongst their physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals
[05:29.040 --> 05:34.720]  that are essential for life on this planet. And so, the information we cover exposes their
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.920]  evil works and sabotages their globalist takeover. And we're having an incredible effect thanks to
[05:39.920 --> 05:45.120]  your support and your word of mouth. But it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves
[05:45.120 --> 05:50.080]  with high quality water filtration at Infowars.com. And with amazing supplements,
[05:50.080 --> 05:54.400]  many of which that just came back in the stock, like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula,
[05:54.400 --> 06:16.400]  now 40% off for a limited time at Infowarsstore.com. So let's fight the Infowars, but also take care of our bodies.
[06:25.120 --> 06:31.440]  Owen Troyer. Now, before you change that dial, because the great Alex Jones
[06:32.240 --> 06:37.440]  is not hosting today, and believe me, I get it, you tuned into here, Alex, you're getting Owen Troyer.
[06:38.400 --> 06:44.560]  Not only do I have a loaded transmission today with so much bombshell information,
[06:45.600 --> 06:51.360]  it's overwhelming, quite frankly. And as usual, nobody's going to give you the angles
[06:51.360 --> 06:58.000]  like Infowars is. So there's a reason why we're next year's news today. So all these major developments
[06:58.640 --> 07:03.520]  that are actually coming to fruition now, Infowars has been talking about for over a year. We're going
[07:03.520 --> 07:09.600]  to tell you what's coming next today. But more importantly, before you maybe change the dial,
[07:09.600 --> 07:12.960]  because you're not going to hear from Alex today, we may be hearing from Alex today, but I want to
[07:12.960 --> 07:23.360]  explain something. Alex is working on a new project right now that you'll probably hear about maybe
[07:23.360 --> 07:32.400]  within the month, I would say. Now, you know, you can see what goes on here. The attacks that we're
[07:32.400 --> 07:42.720]  under, the corrupt government, the corrupt politicians, the corrupt media, everybody out to get us,
[07:42.720 --> 07:50.720]  everybody, I mean, we've been essentially targeted with a hypersonic missile for destruction.
[07:52.720 --> 07:56.480]  And they keep hitting us with them, and we just keep ticking along, keep staying on air,
[07:56.480 --> 08:04.480]  keep coming in here every day. And so the reason why Alex is not hosting today is because, as I said,
[08:04.480 --> 08:09.760]  he's working on a new project. Now, I want to explain this because this is so important.
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.960]  For the future of Infowars, this is more important than any of the news I'm going to cover. We cover
[08:16.960 --> 08:22.080]  the news and all this stuff for the future of America, but no, let me talk about the future
[08:22.080 --> 08:32.960]  of Infowars here for one second and explain what's going on. It's a miracle that we've made it this
[08:32.960 --> 08:40.800]  far. It'd be like going on a space expedition, and the gaslight is on, and somehow the space shuttle
[08:40.800 --> 08:48.240]  is still moving and heading towards its destination. And there's been a lot of things that have been
[08:48.240 --> 08:55.200]  happening behind the scenes here that any other businessman or any other person running a business
[08:55.200 --> 09:00.720]  or a company would probably have closed the doors and said, I can't do it anymore, not Alex Jones.
[09:01.680 --> 09:09.200]  Instead, Alex Jones has decided to take everything he has. I mean, literally the lint in his pockets
[09:09.200 --> 09:18.000]  and put it all on the table and go all in for Infowars so that we can have a chance to exist
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.920]  in the future. Now, I'm really excited about some of the projects that we've launched,
[09:24.880 --> 09:32.320]  but it's basically an all or nothing scenario now. So I understand people that tune in kind of get a
[09:32.320 --> 09:40.480]  little punch drunk to it all or a little numb to it all, but Alex is not exaggerating. He doesn't
[09:40.480 --> 09:44.080]  just say it tongue-in-cheek. It's like, hey, we don't even know if we could be on air tomorrow.
[09:45.120 --> 09:51.280]  And I'm not saying that to be distressful or anything. I'm just saying that that's the real
[09:51.280 --> 10:00.800]  case. So here's what I ask of you today. Please, for the future of Infowars, if you want to
[10:00.800 --> 10:06.000]  for the future of Infowars, if you like Infowars, if you appreciate everything Alex Jones has done
[10:06.000 --> 10:13.840]  over the years, please go to infowarstore.com and just spend 20 bucks, 50 bucks, 100 bucks, 500 bucks,
[10:13.840 --> 10:19.360]  whatever you can do today. Because Alex is going to be working on something for about nine hours
[10:19.360 --> 10:27.520]  today that you'll hear about within the month is my guess. And we hope it's going to be a
[10:27.520 --> 10:33.280]  smashing success and we hope it can maybe put a bunch of fuel in our tank to continue to journey
[10:33.280 --> 10:40.080]  into the future. But when Alex finishes up this project, he's already been up here working for
[10:40.080 --> 10:47.360]  about three hours today. He's going to be here all night. When he finishes up this project,
[10:48.640 --> 10:54.000]  I would love for him to get good news that we had massive sales on the website today.
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.680]  And we've got big fuel in the tank, even before he launches this next project to give him some
[11:01.680 --> 11:08.880]  comfort and some ease when he finishes up what he's doing today. And so normally you hear from Alex,
[11:10.240 --> 11:15.120]  we may or may not hear from him, probably not. My guess is he's way too, he's going to be way too
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.680]  busy doing this project that he's working on. He is in studio. He is right across the door over here.
[11:19.680 --> 11:24.160]  But he's working on something that's going to be very important for the future of infowars.
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.600]  And he's just gone all in, folks. He's gone all in. He's scraping the lint out of his pocket.
[11:31.200 --> 11:37.440]  It's all in. That's the level we're at. That's not to say we've lost is to say,
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.880]  no, we're going forward to victory no matter what. We've already been victorious.
[11:42.880 --> 11:50.480]  So the best part about it is we got the best supplements. We have the best air filters.
[11:50.480 --> 11:54.320]  We have the best water filters. We have the best emergency food supplies. We have t-shirts.
[11:54.320 --> 11:59.680]  We have hats. We've got a huge storefront. Go find something. Just if you if you love
[11:59.680 --> 12:03.840]  and appreciate Alex Jones and you like what Infowars does and you tune in every day,
[12:05.520 --> 12:08.880]  please just go to infowarstore.com and just spend what you can today.
[12:08.880 --> 12:17.120]  Just as an appreciation for Alex so that when he's just completely out of gas after working all day
[12:17.120 --> 12:22.720]  on this new project that I'm very excited about. He's very excited about that he can see we had
[12:22.720 --> 12:28.000]  massive sales today and just really feel great heading into the weekend about the future of
[12:28.000 --> 12:35.440]  Infowars because you know, there's there's a lot of people that work here too. It's not just Alex.
[12:35.440 --> 12:40.160]  It's not just me. We've got a great crew and we've got big plans for the future
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.200]  and you're going to start seeing a lot of this stuff that we've been doing behind the scenes
[12:45.200 --> 12:53.760]  start to come to fruition this winter and then really hopefully manifest next year is the goal
[12:54.720 --> 13:02.160]  but we got to get there. So and folks, there's a reason why you go to infowarstore.com and you're
[13:02.160 --> 13:07.280]  going to see a lot of stuff that's on the waiting list because we're literally all in right now.
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.240]  We need capital just to purchase new products to sell.
[13:14.960 --> 13:21.920]  So if you love and appreciate Alex just go get something from the store today
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.080]  so that when he finishes up working and he sees the numbers on the sales from the website today
[13:26.080 --> 13:32.880]  he can have a big grin on his face and a big a big happiness fill his soul knowing
[13:32.880 --> 13:41.920]  that today was a major victory and him going all in paid off because that's the situation it's at.
[13:41.920 --> 13:50.960]  So this is this is all really a sign of victory quite frankly of course the corrupt
[13:50.960 --> 13:55.680]  corporate world government and United States government and federal government and and politicians
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.120]  and media and everything else of course they're coming after us of course they want to shut down
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.680]  of course that's that's I mean that's that's par for the course here it's not fun I don't
[14:05.680 --> 14:14.320]  enjoy having the federal government up my ass but that's that's what we've done that's why we're the
[14:14.880 --> 14:19.920]  leading edge that's why we hit the barbed wire first so everybody can climb over our bleeding
[14:19.920 --> 14:28.800]  bleeding out rotting husk and and save America because what you're going to see today I don't
[14:28.800 --> 14:38.240]  even know how to cover this quite frankly but Fauci's been caught red-handed and you notice at first
[14:39.760 --> 14:46.000]  and this is my point info wars hit the barbed wire first and just let our bodies sit there and and
[14:46.000 --> 14:53.200]  and let everybody else climb over our bleeding out body on the barbed wire so they could climb
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.960]  over it and not get cut well finally there they're finally getting over it and they see it now and
[15:01.040 --> 15:06.480]  yeah so first it was Fauci denying gain of function research denying spillover research
[15:07.440 --> 15:12.720]  denying any funding denying the Wuhan lab now it's well yeah we were doing some research
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.040]  but not not in the Wuhan lab and then it was well we were doing research and and we were
[15:17.040 --> 15:21.440]  funding the Wuhan lab but it was very very small amounts and it had nothing to do with COVID and
[15:21.440 --> 15:26.240]  and then it was okay yeah we were doing research with COVID in the Wuhan lab but but it's not the
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.160]  same thing as the pandemic so you know what level's next right you know the full admittance of all
[15:32.160 --> 15:39.200]  of this is next and and we have the signs that they know it's coming it's not just the people of
[15:39.200 --> 15:45.120]  the CDC and the FDA and the NIH and everybody else and Pfizer and everybody's stepping down
[15:45.120 --> 15:52.080]  those are those are the signs of the past we've got new signs now they are as I speak Fauci and
[15:52.080 --> 15:57.360]  his minions are doing everything they can to erase the evidence that they caused the pandemic but
[15:57.360 --> 16:02.080]  it's too late Fauci if you're concerned about the power I'm taking this message on the morning of
[16:02.080 --> 16:10.160]  Tuesday October 19th 2021 and I've got some great news to report to the listeners for at least one
[16:10.160 --> 16:15.120]  week we're going to be able to run a sale with Bobby's ultimate turmeric formula that just got
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.720]  back in stock after being sold out almost five months because of supply chain breakdowns it has

[16:55.440 --> 17:03.200]  right now then foreshore.com running this special for one week the COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol
[17:03.200 --> 17:11.120]  of subservience a symbol of slavery a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny combine
[17:11.120 --> 17:17.920]  controlled by the global private corporations has put in place it is the symbol of the permanent
[17:17.920 --> 17:23.680]  emergency from which we will never emerge it is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad
[17:23.680 --> 17:32.320]  and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun it is the symbol of our complete
[17:32.320 --> 17:40.240]  and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the rubicon now
[17:41.200 --> 17:46.240]  the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us claus Schwab and the unit admit they're coming
[17:46.240 --> 17:51.840]  out with implantable microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes things only get worse
[17:51.840 --> 17:58.080]  from here we submit they only get better if we resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance
[17:58.080 --> 18:04.080]  non-compliance we've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration
[18:04.080 --> 18:08.880]  camp in world war two that when they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't
[18:08.880 --> 18:12.800]  stand up and then when they came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up
[18:13.760 --> 18:18.320]  and finally when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up oh the global social
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.800]  credit score that china is putting in it's banning people to three hours of video games a week and
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.360]  if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought
[18:27.360 --> 18:32.240]  here and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now
[18:32.240 --> 18:35.760]  they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're going to track where you
[18:35.760 --> 18:40.400]  go and what you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are
[18:40.400 --> 18:46.160]  about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the leftist having fun right now with all
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.160]  the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're all going
[18:50.160 --> 18:54.720]  to be targeted by this nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them
[18:54.720 --> 18:58.320]  or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists

[20:32.640 --> 20:37.840]  i'm so overwhelmed by all the information and developments that i have here in front of me
[20:37.840 --> 20:43.600]  as we head into the weekend and what it means for the future that i really don't even know how to
[20:43.600 --> 20:52.720]  properly introduce it or or come out of the gates here to try to cover it so i think
[20:54.720 --> 21:00.480]  the best way to do that is going to be reading the opening from
[21:00.480 --> 21:14.800]  um the famous novel a tale of two cities the famous dickens novel because it really
[21:16.240 --> 21:21.440]  seems to apply to these current times unlike any other way it could possibly be put
[21:22.800 --> 21:30.240]  and so it goes like this it was the best of times it was the worst of times it was the age
[21:30.240 --> 21:38.400]  of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it was the epoch of incredulity
[21:39.200 --> 21:46.000]  it was the season of light it was the season of darkness it was the spring of hope it was
[21:46.000 --> 21:53.520]  the winter of despair we had everything before us we had nothing before us we were all going
[21:53.520 --> 22:01.200]  direct to heaven we were all going direct the other way in short the period was so far like the
[22:01.200 --> 22:08.880]  present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or for
[22:08.880 --> 22:20.080]  evil in the superlative degree of comparison only and is that not where we are right now
[22:20.080 --> 22:29.680]  now is that not the best way to describe these unbelievable times as we are living them
[22:32.560 --> 22:40.240]  because i put it in the modern day parlance of it is the great reset versus the great awakening
[22:40.240 --> 22:44.080]  because that's what's going on the great awakening is happening humanity is
[22:44.080 --> 22:49.200]  awaking waking up to all the lies that's been told all the corruption the threat of world government
[22:50.960 --> 22:55.440]  its freedoms being dissolved its its sovereignty being dissolved all of it the world is waking
[22:55.440 --> 23:02.240]  up to that that's undeniable but then that entity that beast that has the intention of
[23:02.240 --> 23:11.520]  conquering the world and enslaving humanity that also is moving forward it's the great reset versus
[23:11.520 --> 23:22.720]  the great awakening so let me just preview what we have coming up today and what is the most important
[23:22.720 --> 23:28.640]  news i guess you could be the decision maker there for yourself but you know that's why
[23:29.520 --> 23:35.120]  we have all these distractions going right now like oh what happened with brian laundry and gabby
[23:35.120 --> 23:41.600]  patito it's just a distraction oh what happened with alex baldwin shooting somebody on a movie set
[23:41.600 --> 23:47.280]  it's just a distraction and you know it can be big news and it can you know get the public's
[23:47.280 --> 23:55.760]  attention and and and that that is what it is but it's all a distraction from the massive
[23:55.760 --> 24:00.320]  developments that we have the supply chain shortage the consumer price index going up
[24:00.320 --> 24:06.880]  that's not going away that's only getting worse and of course it's all the democrat party's fault
[24:06.880 --> 24:10.480]  it's all joe biden's fault it's all by design it's all the corporate world government it was
[24:10.480 --> 24:15.440]  the plan in the first place this isn't something that organically is just happening a supply
[24:15.440 --> 24:19.920]  chain shortage consumer price index going up to record highs no no that was planned out that
[24:19.920 --> 24:26.080]  that's an act of war that's going on right now that's a big deal that's going to impact everybody
[24:26.080 --> 24:34.400]  that's listening to this right now and everybody that's not you've got biden last night at a town
[24:34.400 --> 24:39.680]  hall if you even want to call it that for cnn a fake town hall they did they they kept the
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.320]  location secret there nobody was allowed to be in attendance except the people that they hand
[24:44.320 --> 24:49.520]  selected so it's not even a real town hall it's just scripted and fake like everything else
[24:49.520 --> 24:57.600]  this white house does and then some of the things that biden said are just incredible
[24:58.960 --> 25:02.080]  folks the guy basically blacked out on the stage
[25:05.600 --> 25:10.400]  i don't know how else to explain it so we'll have that coming up
[25:10.400 --> 25:17.600]  you've got finally though it's a small percentage
[25:19.520 --> 25:24.720]  of republicans that are fighting back against the new world order tyranny fighting back against
[25:24.720 --> 25:29.680]  the corrupt federal government and calling out their fellow politicians in congress for being
[25:30.880 --> 25:37.600]  corrupt and despicable evil people small number of republicans but better than nothing
[25:37.600 --> 25:45.360]  then so that's coming up but but and then there's all kinds of other news that's it's all big honestly
[25:45.360 --> 25:52.080]  the cultural news the geopolitical news what's going on in schools and school board meetings
[25:53.840 --> 26:03.280]  but really this is the big news that only info wars can can properly bring you today
[26:03.280 --> 26:07.920]  because we've been ahead of the curve on all of this and so we're going to stay ahead of the
[26:07.920 --> 26:15.360]  curve on all of this but the best way i can put it before really just digging into this stack of
[26:15.360 --> 26:23.120]  news and and and explaining it in more detail fouchie's been caught folks fouchie's been caught
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.200]  he did the gain of function research he did the spillover research he funded the wuhan lab
[26:29.200 --> 26:34.720]  he helped the chinese military make a bio weapon he's been caught it's over he knows it and others
[26:34.720 --> 26:39.200]  know it that's why you've seen people step down at the cdc that's why you've seen people step down
[26:39.200 --> 26:43.040]  at the ni age that's why you've seen people step down from these big pharmaceutical companies
[26:43.680 --> 26:49.440]  that's why you've seen a lot of these people just step down because they don't get it at first
[26:49.440 --> 26:53.040]  they don't understand that they're saying why what what are we doing with this experimental vaccine
[26:53.040 --> 26:57.360]  pushing it on people and now kids and now mandating it why are we covering up the side
[26:57.360 --> 27:03.440]  effects why are we covering up the deaths and then they start to look into what's going on they
[27:03.440 --> 27:09.360]  start to look at fouchie's background and they realize whoa i don't want anything to do with
[27:09.360 --> 27:20.480]  whatever this is or what this appears to be which the least evil of would be a giant money grab and
[27:20.480 --> 27:30.240]  power grab the most evil would be a giant mass murdering of the earth's population whether that's
[27:30.240 --> 27:33.920]  with covid made in the lab or these vaccines that are killing tens of thousands of people
[27:33.920 --> 27:39.920]  the point is they're seeing this and they are pulling out and now other governments and countries
[27:39.920 --> 27:47.120]  are seeing this and they're pulling out and as we sit here fouchie and his minions that knowingly
[27:47.120 --> 27:52.160]  did all this are trying to erase all the evidence but it's too late
[27:54.800 --> 28:01.440]  because even if they can erase all the evidence then that's just going to be another crime that
[28:01.440 --> 28:09.120]  they've committed which is erasing evidence tampering with evidence hiding crimes but i guess
[28:09.120 --> 28:14.160]  they figure it's better for them to be caught red-handed tampering with evidence or erasing
[28:14.160 --> 28:18.640]  evidence which is which by the way it's all going to be illegal not just in a criminal case but
[28:18.640 --> 28:22.400]  because this is all government these are all government documents they're all supposed to
[28:22.400 --> 28:27.600]  be public documents they're all supposed to be archives they're erasing all of them right now
[28:28.480 --> 28:35.200]  and so i guess they figure hey it's it's better us go down for illegally getting rid of government
[28:35.200 --> 28:41.840]  documents or public documents or these archive documents it's better us go down for that than
[28:41.840 --> 28:48.400]  for us to go down with medical malpractice or something much more worse or a violation of
[28:48.400 --> 28:52.960]  the nuremberg code or a violation of the biological weapons treaty they figure hey erasing evidence
[28:52.960 --> 28:56.880]  and getting rid of government documents probably better off for us than what we've really done here
[28:58.480 --> 29:06.560]  hey everybody confused because of the globalist reset info wars listeners and viewers know a lot
[29:06.560 --> 29:12.800]  of our best-selling products have been sold out in some cases for up to a year bodies ultimate

[29:19.360 --> 29:24.480]  the high-quality turmeric and the concentration process is very very expensive and time-consuming

[29:57.760 --> 30:13.040]  if you only knew the power of the dark side join bill gates and together we will defeat humanity
[30:14.240 --> 30:23.280]  then our gods will reward us with eternal life that's basically the ethos of the globalists
[30:23.280 --> 30:31.760]  they must first play god they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic
[30:31.760 --> 30:37.280]  system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[30:38.080 --> 30:42.240]  destroy our children's futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open we really
[30:42.880 --> 30:50.080]  deserve what's happened to us so i asked you now are you going to step up and expose the
[30:50.080 --> 30:56.400]  new order even more i know i'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts the front lines the
[30:56.400 --> 31:03.360]  fight is info wars.com why do my enemies hate me so much why do the globalists hate you so much
[31:03.360 --> 31:10.800]  why do they hate america so much because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system
[31:10.800 --> 31:16.240]  that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world government
[31:16.240 --> 31:22.800]  their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and due process
[31:22.800 --> 31:29.760]  injustice and god fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with bill gates
[31:29.760 --> 31:35.760]  you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight with the un they started
[31:35.760 --> 31:41.600]  a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away and they're not going
[31:41.600 --> 31:48.000]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put into them the average person still
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.800]  doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism or about corporate fascism and it's
[31:52.800 --> 31:57.920]  not until people understand that and that we're under attack we have any chance of beating these
[31:57.920 --> 32:03.600]  people by now you've heard me talk about the bio pros and how they're creating amazing products
[32:03.600 --> 32:09.280]  they've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio remediation products

[32:56.960 --> 33:04.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:13.280 --> 33:21.600]  from the front lines of the information war it's owin shroyer you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:21.600 --> 33:32.080]  so i'm going to try to take a complex issue and then simplify it here first and then get
[33:32.080 --> 33:40.080]  into the complexities of it but simply put anthony fowchie peter dosik and others
[33:41.840 --> 33:47.600]  we're doing gain of function spillover research with sars covid viruses
[33:47.600 --> 33:53.680]  and we're exclusively working with the chinese communist military
[33:55.840 --> 34:06.160]  in a lab in wuhan to create a deadly virus from an animal spliced with other viruses so that could
[34:06.160 --> 34:13.120]  be transmitted to humans and be highly infectious and i guess they hoped highly deadly maybe it wasn't
[34:13.120 --> 34:21.280]  as deadly as they liked maybe it was as deadly as they expected which of course led to the
[34:21.280 --> 34:30.320]  covid 19 pandemic which has been used as the backdrop for the great reset which is just a buzz
[34:31.040 --> 34:39.360]  phrase for the corporate world government takeover of the planet which will alter ultimately
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.040]  the excuse will be because of climate change so that they can control all of your movement so first
[34:45.040 --> 34:50.080]  it's convinced you that you're a virus and you're bad and need to be a slave then it's convinced
[34:50.080 --> 34:55.680]  you you're a parasite and a pollution machine and so you're bad and so you need to be a slave
[34:57.280 --> 35:05.680]  and that's what this whole thing is all about now that's about as simply as i could put it
[35:05.680 --> 35:13.440]  it crimes against humanity uh crimes on a mass scale i mean illegal bio weapons research illegal
[35:13.440 --> 35:20.560]  bio weapons release they've been caught we've got all them on tape we've got all their documents
[35:20.560 --> 35:26.880]  we've got all of it now let me try to take that that simple explanation and and explain it
[35:26.880 --> 35:34.640]  with all the complexities here now you may recall and i am proud of this
[35:36.800 --> 35:42.080]  info wars should be proud that we broke all of this first years ahead of the rest of the news media
[35:46.000 --> 35:55.760]  but we knew this was exactly what was going on february of 2020 and i think now actually though
[35:55.760 --> 36:04.240]  it appears that and perhaps even trump knew this that they knew in october of 2019
[36:05.120 --> 36:10.160]  that it had gotten out of a lab or that they had released it or maybe they released it intentionally
[36:10.160 --> 36:13.840]  and some people that weren't in on it knew that that's what happened and maybe they thought it was
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.200]  a mistake so they were telling trump they were telling the chinese government they were telling
[36:17.200 --> 36:23.680]  all of these people but the point is it was well known that fauci and dashik were doing
[36:23.680 --> 36:30.080]  bio weapons research in the wuhan lab and it was known by october of 2019 that the virus
[36:30.080 --> 36:37.120]  had been released onto the planet and that's why they started signing all these documents and
[36:37.120 --> 36:42.560]  having all this stuff by the end of october 2019 because they knew that's when it came out
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.160]  now the timeline between then and and february or march whenever they started to do all the
[36:50.160 --> 36:57.200]  lockdowns and everything uh that's still kind of uh why was it on that timeline i don't know but
[36:58.400 --> 37:03.200]  maybe they were covering their tracks then like we're seeing them do now so but what happened
[37:03.200 --> 37:08.960]  well it was denied there's no wuhan lab there's no gain of function research it came from a bat soup
[37:10.240 --> 37:15.680]  dish it came from a wet market so first it was complete denial of all of that
[37:15.680 --> 37:22.720]  then what was it oh well there oh it does seem like there was a lab right there in wuhan near
[37:22.720 --> 37:27.680]  the wet market where they're claiming it went out let's look into that lab oh wow they were
[37:27.680 --> 37:33.200]  doing bio weapons research oh oh they were working with bat viruses oh they were working
[37:33.200 --> 37:39.760]  with sarz covet 19 in that lab huh and then they kept looking into it what else is going on oh
[37:39.760 --> 37:45.680]  oh there was gain of function research shifted during the obama years from north carolina
[37:45.680 --> 37:51.280]  to that wuhan lab fauci was overseeing the funding dosik was overseeing the operations
[37:52.080 --> 37:58.000]  the chinese communist military was running the lab oh that's odd oh there was gain of function
[37:58.000 --> 38:05.600]  oh there was spillover now we have all those documents and then it was and this is kind of
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.360]  now the new developments but there's new new developments so this is the last range of new
[38:09.360 --> 38:15.600]  developments now there's new new developments then it was oh okay well it did cut it yeah we we were
[38:15.600 --> 38:20.160]  making car covid and sarz viruses in the lab and we were doing gain of function and spillover
[38:20.160 --> 38:25.200]  research they can't deny it now we have all the documents we have them on tape but that's not
[38:25.200 --> 38:34.160]  the virus that caused the pandemic no no no no no so so it's been this slow rollout of denying
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.120]  everything that was going on to now admitting everything that was going on but here's the
[38:39.120 --> 38:48.000]  stage where we're at now oh well our viruses weren't the viruses that got released no no no yeah
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.680]  everything that we denied and now that you have us on tape admitting and have all the
[38:51.680 --> 38:57.360]  documents proving that yeah it was us but that wasn't what started the pandemic no no no no no
[38:57.360 --> 39:00.880]  that wasn't so yeah we lied about everything else and we covered everything else up and we
[39:00.880 --> 39:05.520]  denied everything else but but you know what okay but it wasn't us we didn't do the pandemic
[39:05.520 --> 39:10.800]  yeah everything you said we did we lied about and covered up and denied okay fine you caught us we
[39:10.800 --> 39:17.920]  did do all that you're right but it wasn't us we didn't do the pandemic but see everyone knows it
[39:17.920 --> 39:22.320]  now everyone knows Fauci's involvement everyone knows Dossick's involvement everybody knows the
[39:22.320 --> 39:27.440]  chinese communist military's involvement everybody knows all of it so right now they are in the
[39:27.440 --> 39:34.320]  process of scrubbing all the evidence that's what's going on right now they are trying to get rid of
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.120]  all the evidence but it's not going to matter the evidence is already out there we have them on
[39:37.120 --> 39:40.240]  tape we have the government documents and anything they do now to cover it up it's just
[39:40.240 --> 39:47.840]  going to add to the list of crimes that they've committed but see there's a reason why Alex Jones
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.600]  was the voice in the wilderness when people at the NIH and big pharma companies and the CDC and
[39:53.600 --> 39:59.440]  the FDA started stepping down for major roles because that was the recognition look these people
[39:59.440 --> 40:02.960]  aren't in the spotlight they don't do interviews they're not interested in media they don't do
[40:02.960 --> 40:08.320]  they do they do medicine they do science whatever but maybe they're not evil people so as soon as
[40:08.320 --> 40:13.520]  they figured out what was going on they were out they pulled out they quit they didn't want anything
[40:13.520 --> 40:19.760]  to do with it and you did have some whistleblowers go public as to why and and we do have the project
[40:19.760 --> 40:26.560]  veritas undercover footage but they've been caught folks and there's no putting it back in the bottle
[40:26.560 --> 40:34.160]  now they've got two options they can try to cover up all the crimes committed by Fauci or they can
[40:34.160 --> 40:39.920]  move their plans for for world conquering and domination to a next level and just release
[40:39.920 --> 40:46.160]  if they have it a more deadly bio weapon or just start a nuclear war a world war three
[40:46.160 --> 40:51.120]  to distract from all of this but see Fauci is just one little minion in this whole plan so
[40:51.120 --> 40:57.200]  so the new world order really doesn't care if Fauci gets burned if Fauci has to go down and get burned
[40:57.920 --> 41:04.560]  to preserve the corporate world government and the great reset then he will and there'll be nothing
[41:04.560 --> 41:09.360]  he can do about it and he'll sputter around and he'll spin around and he'll try to do everything
[41:09.360 --> 41:17.440]  he can but it won't matter and he knows it so i'm going to try to connect all of this and i
[41:17.440 --> 41:23.840]  i basically just trying to describe all of it here in this nine-minute segment without now getting
[41:23.840 --> 41:31.440]  into the weeds of the new developments but let's let's start to kind of brush the surface of these
[41:31.440 --> 41:38.800]  new developments right now NIH admits funding gain of function COVID experiments gives eco health
[41:38.800 --> 41:45.040]  five days to report data where do you think that data is going trash can trash can but we already
[41:45.040 --> 41:52.400]  have some of it see that's their problem like kathryn heritage hhs letters backup docs on
[41:52.400 --> 41:57.920]  wuhan lab states analysis confirms bat corona viruses studied under eco health alliance grant
[41:57.920 --> 42:04.720]  could not have been the source of COVID-19 pandemic so it's literally like here's the document showing
[42:04.720 --> 42:09.680]  all of it here's the document showing you made the virus the exact virus here's all the documents
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.680]  gain a function funding all of it and they just say but it wasn't us we didn't do the pandemic
[42:13.680 --> 42:16.480]  you just have all the proof that we did the pandemic but it wasn't us we swear
[42:19.280 --> 42:24.080]  but they found eco health alliance failed to report certain findings required by the
[42:24.080 --> 42:32.080]  terms of the grant they were covering up their research folks so they've been caught so we're
[42:32.080 --> 42:37.760]  at the final stage of denial after this stage of denial there's no other stages of denial
[42:37.760 --> 42:44.000]  now so they've been caught on every other realm of this except now they're just denying that
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.360]  they're responsible for the pandemic so they're admitting yep we did all the research we did
[42:47.360 --> 42:52.080]  the gain of function we funded it we worked in the wuhan lab we work with the chinese military
[42:52.080 --> 43:02.160]  but it wasn't us that did the pandemic we swear that's coming next i am taping this update on

[45:08.560 --> 45:13.440]  William in California people are asleep and programmed controlled I agree how do you make
[45:13.440 --> 45:18.800]  the sleeper awaken William oh hi Alice thanks for taking my call can I plug uh iowlits real quick
[45:18.800 --> 45:25.120]  yeah go ahead hey on my 60s uh and I did the work of 25 30 year olds and I worked them into
[45:25.120 --> 45:30.160]  the ground and you wanted to why and I've tested this and I've taken your b12 and let me tell you
[45:30.160 --> 45:37.200]  when I don't take it I pay a price I really do I take that b12 and I'm electric man I can run 10
[45:37.200 --> 45:42.720]  miles I I do some pretty heavy work uh with a highway department and my friends will attest to
[45:42.720 --> 45:49.200]  the fact that yeah for a guy in his 60s you know pushing 70 I'm and I know I'm not just blowing
[45:49.200 --> 45:58.640]  smoke here the b12 saves my life
[45:59.920 --> 46:06.320]  the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[46:06.320 --> 46:11.280]  chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[46:11.280 --> 46:17.440]  because we're made the image of God the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers
[46:17.440 --> 46:22.880]  fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first
[46:22.880 --> 46:31.760]  came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was
[46:31.760 --> 46:36.800]  hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[46:36.800 --> 46:44.080]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world
[46:44.080 --> 46:48.240]  who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air
[46:48.240 --> 46:53.040]  now more than ever because even if you don't believe in God what the globalists are manifesting
[46:53.040 --> 46:58.160]  and setting up is safe and and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[46:58.160 --> 47:14.880]  they just announced you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:18.560 --> 47:26.240]  so understand this i would say within six months certainly before the midterm elections
[47:26.240 --> 47:36.640]  everybody out there that still has a soul and a mind and a brain is going to be info wars
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.080]  and it's not going to be like a spartacus moment where everybody stands up and says i am spartacus
[47:42.080 --> 47:47.760]  or or i am alex jones or i'm info wars we probably won't get the credit who even knows if people
[47:47.760 --> 47:51.600]  knew that we've been talking about all this for over a year doesn't really matter to us
[47:51.600 --> 47:59.520]  but it's going to be it's inevitable that all of this is going to become so real
[48:00.560 --> 48:06.160]  that even denying it or not wanting to talk about it for your own personal cautions is
[48:06.160 --> 48:09.520]  is it's all going to be out the window it's all going to be out the window within six months
[48:10.320 --> 48:14.720]  definitely before the midterm elections now on the other side of that coin is that
[48:14.720 --> 48:23.280]  the the corrupt corporate global government that we're going against they're not going to
[48:23.280 --> 48:27.920]  back off so they're going to have to have some sort of a counter punch to this massive awakening
[48:27.920 --> 48:31.600]  i mean it's the great reset versus the great awakening so when the great awakening has a punch
[48:32.640 --> 48:38.960]  you know and a headlock then the great reset has an arm bar and and something else or a shiv really
[48:38.960 --> 48:49.600]  so that's inevitable now let me get into the weeds of the latest developments now again
[48:51.280 --> 48:58.240]  we're to the point where everything on the timeline for the last year and a half that that
[48:58.240 --> 49:03.920]  info wars is always reporting first that's just the facts is is now being completely admitted
[49:03.920 --> 49:10.080]  there's only one thing now there's only one thing that is still being denied and that is that it's
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.960]  the research that happened in that wuhan lab that was responsible for the pandemic
[49:16.480 --> 49:19.600]  and people might not want to say it was intentional they may say oh accidental
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.840]  that may be what they try to fall back on but it won't matter it won't matter because
[49:25.840 --> 49:33.920]  eventually that facade is going to fall as well just like every other facade to this point so
[49:33.920 --> 49:39.200]  they're only their only level of denial that they have left final level of denial i guess
[49:39.200 --> 49:42.560]  they could have one more that they did it intentionally so maybe there's two levels
[49:42.560 --> 49:47.920]  of denial left one that it was responsible for the pandemic that facade is going to fall i would
[49:47.920 --> 49:52.800]  say by the end of the year and then the other facade would be whether it was done intentionally
[49:52.800 --> 49:57.120]  so that may only be the only that may be the last level of denial past this one
[49:57.760 --> 50:02.640]  which is that oh it wasn't us it wasn't this that started the pandemic well yeah it was
[50:04.560 --> 50:08.320]  so they're in the process of scrubbing all their data they're in the process of getting
[50:08.320 --> 50:15.840]  rid of all the documents and all the proof of all of it because now there's people and journalists
[50:15.840 --> 50:21.280]  and politicians and health officials and doctors that are actually saying wait wait a second we
[50:21.280 --> 50:24.080]  need to look into this we need to look further in these documents you need to provide us with
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.080]  more documents eco health alliance you need to provide us with more documents wuhan lab
[50:28.960 --> 50:34.640]  you need to provide us with more documents fauci dosik and so they've been given timetables and
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.600]  right now i would say they're in the process of removing as much as possible to cover it up
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.280]  and so again just just to repeat this and continue down the the path here
[50:47.280 --> 50:52.560]  nih admits funding gain a function covet experiments gives eco health five days to report data
[50:53.360 --> 50:58.800]  and then you have kathryn herrige with the other documents showing that it was all in the wuhan
[50:58.800 --> 51:04.560]  lab but that so they admit it because kathryn herrige has the documents she's like look we've
[51:04.560 --> 51:08.240]  already had these documents but but kathryn herrige is kind of you know she's allowed to report
[51:08.240 --> 51:12.000]  things and go on the mainstream news so when she reports it it kind of you know then it finally
[51:12.000 --> 51:19.360]  enters the mainstream consciousness but see she's still going along with the narrative now that
[51:19.360 --> 51:23.920]  they're giving her which is oh but we didn't do the pandemic it's it's a different virus these
[51:23.920 --> 51:28.560]  are different viruses well wait a second you lied that any of this was going on so why would we
[51:28.560 --> 51:33.200]  believe you now saying that it wasn't your fault that there was a pandemic it was a different virus
[51:35.200 --> 51:39.440]  of course we wouldn't we're smarter than that but that's that's the level that we're at right now
[51:39.440 --> 51:49.760]  but this now it just gets weirder because it shows that there was prior knowledge to this
[51:49.760 --> 51:55.760]  that was being covered up by governments and slowly and surely as more people realized what
[51:55.760 --> 52:00.240]  was going on people started pulling themselves out government started pulling themselves out
[52:01.840 --> 52:07.120]  and i guess for whatever reason not knowing what to do just decided to bury this lead
[52:07.120 --> 52:11.680]  that this was gain of function research done by Fauci and the chinese communists
[52:11.680 --> 52:16.480]  that eventually led to the COVID-19 pandemic maybe because they want the great reset maybe
[52:16.480 --> 52:20.960]  because they were afraid to go up against this criminal corporate world government i don't know
[52:22.000 --> 52:30.880]  but this is from last year iranian doctors urge neighbors to liquidate any u.s biological labs
[52:30.880 --> 52:37.120]  amid coronavirus fears a group of 101 iranian doctors has penned a letter addressed to the
[52:37.120 --> 52:43.840]  leaders of afghanistan georgia iraq kazakhstan kursakstan and pakistan to take immediate action to
[52:43.840 --> 52:52.000]  destroy all of us biological laboratories that was in 2020 folks they knew it they all knew it then
[52:53.920 --> 52:59.760]  but we don't exactly have good relations with those countries so we weren't cooperating with them
[52:59.760 --> 53:06.080]  and when they were announcing that they figured out it was the u.s made bio weapon in a lab with
[53:06.080 --> 53:11.040]  Fauci the media didn't report on it but there it is in sputnik from last year here's another one
[53:11.040 --> 53:17.920]  last year ukraine's opposition accuses us of scrubbing info about bio labs activities on
[53:17.920 --> 53:25.280]  ukrainian territory so they were already erasing the evidence folks they were already erasing the
[53:25.280 --> 53:33.120]  evidence and all these other labs because they realized okay we got caught in the wuhan lab
[53:34.080 --> 53:38.400]  we've got to scrub all the other biological weapons research we were doing we got to hide
[53:38.400 --> 53:43.280]  all the other crimes we committed in violation of the nirnberg code we got to do it now this was
[53:43.280 --> 53:52.960]  all happening last year here's another one artificial intelligence provided early detection
[53:52.960 --> 53:59.200]  of the coronavirus in china and will influence future urban health policy internationally now now
[53:59.200 --> 54:05.440]  this is going to tie into something else that's going on here that is so incredible that we're
[54:05.440 --> 54:12.160]  just now learning it but it is what it is so again and i and i think trump knew it too
[54:13.600 --> 54:20.240]  the virus escaped or was released in october of 2019 and everybody knew it but
[54:20.240 --> 54:26.720]  but the people that weren't actually running the operation didn't know exactly what was going on
[54:27.760 --> 54:32.160]  so that's why trump's waited and then said oh it's just the flu even though he signed executive
[54:32.160 --> 54:39.360]  orders preparing for a pandemic that's why all these other countries started to limit travel
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.920]  that's why you saw the stuff coming out of china and then once they realized what was going on
[54:44.480 --> 54:48.720]  they said we got to shut down all these us web uh bio weapons labs they just released a pandemic
[54:48.720 --> 54:54.480]  on the planet of course the media didn't cover any of it but so they say oh artificial intelligence
[54:54.480 --> 55:01.040]  detecting covid will influence future health policy internationally well what do they talk about
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.760]  so now this has been discovered and and again this is all old news it's just now now it's going
[55:07.760 --> 55:19.680]  mainstream willis research network partners with meta biota to expand pandemic risk expertise now
[55:19.680 --> 55:29.200]  there's a whole thread on this from blue canaries on twitter that that really gets into it and i
[55:29.200 --> 55:33.840]  think this is going to be the next shoe to drop in the overall thing and i'm going to try to
[55:33.840 --> 55:41.840]  simplify this as i as simply as i can in this long thread meta biota produces bioagents under
[55:41.840 --> 55:49.200]  diplomatic cover at secret labs then sells pandemic insurance and trackers to help countries get ahead
[55:49.200 --> 55:57.040]  of what they are putting out company part of pentagon's drta program as well as funded by
[55:57.040 --> 56:06.480]  rosemont senica that's hunter biden's company mm-hmm yeah so folks these bio weapons labs to
[56:06.480 --> 56:16.240]  put it simply these bio weapons labs have insurance in case their virus escapes gets out or maybe even
[56:16.240 --> 56:23.360]  released and it's unbelievable in this thread and it gets into how they've done it in the past with
[56:23.360 --> 56:29.040]  ebola it gets into how they've done it in in other countries it gets into how they get
[56:29.040 --> 56:35.200]  billions of dollars in contracts from the military it shows the bio weapons research
[56:35.200 --> 56:41.280]  that's been done in 25 different countries at least uh it shows more government documents
[56:41.280 --> 56:46.240]  showing that they knew this was all biological research that could escape in all these different
[56:46.240 --> 56:57.600]  countries it's it's all documented in this thread so why would they with hunter biden's company
[56:58.960 --> 57:06.480]  be having insurance it's just incredible as i'm just re going through all of this
[57:06.480 --> 57:12.240]  why would they have insurance on all these bio weapons labs if they weren't making bio weapons
[57:12.240 --> 57:16.800]  why would they have bio weapons insurance in case something got out and killed people
[57:17.360 --> 57:24.400]  if they weren't making bio weapons and how is this even legal you're in violation of the
[57:24.400 --> 57:30.720]  norenberg code making these bio weapons and and and there's an insurance company i mean can you
[57:30.720 --> 57:36.800]  imagine if i had an insurance company for making counterfeit money can you imagine if i had an
[57:36.800 --> 57:42.240]  insurance company for for you know any any mass crime but oh they have insurance for bio weapons
[57:42.240 --> 57:51.760]  research in case it gets out and they knew it got out yeah the technocrats the technocrats
[57:52.480 --> 57:59.680]  the social engineers the behavioral psychologist they're all part of the same satanic globalist
[57:59.680 --> 58:06.880]  control free system that seeks to play god that seeks to turn the general population of this earth
[58:06.880 --> 58:13.920]  into their slaves into putty into clay in their hands that they control and chief amongst their
[58:13.920 --> 58:19.520]  physical attacks is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life
[58:19.520 --> 58:25.840]  on this planet and so the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their
[58:25.840 --> 58:30.240]  globalist takeoff and we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of
[58:30.240 --> 58:35.120]  bound but it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high quality water
[58:35.120 --> 58:40.400]  filtration at infowarstore.com and with amazing supplements many of which that just came back
[58:40.400 --> 58:47.120]  in the stop like bodies ultimate turmeric formula now 40 off for a limited time at infowarstore.com
[58:47.120 --> 58:52.800]  so let's fight the info war but also take care of our bodies the engineers at bio pros are very
[58:52.800 --> 58:59.360]  excited to announce a major expansion of new products into the retail consumer market since
[58:59.360 --> 59:04.480]  their rollout of their first product almost a year ago they come out with four new products

[59:14.640 --> 59:20.320]  major chemical corporations have been using patented naturally occurring specially bred
[59:20.320 --> 59:27.520]  bacteria to eat oil spills and other toxic waste disasters that's how powerful these naturally
[59:27.520 --> 59:33.920]  occurring microbes are the bio pro system is light years better than traditional enzymes that only
[59:33.920 --> 59:40.080]  work once these bacteria begin to breed and live in your septic tank and now it's available for
[59:40.080 --> 59:50.880]  the general public's use for the first time on the retail market exclusively available at the bio pros.com

[1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:25.280]  there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions haven't let go in so much space
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:35.280]  but it wasn't because i didn't know enough i just knew too much
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:39.440]  does that make me crazy maybe that does make us busy
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:47.280]  so i'm about to put a bow on this and get into some of the other news
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:54.000]  and i just hope i've done a good job breaking this down and covering it because it's so
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:01.840]  overwhelming and it's so incredible and and quite frankly beyond the pay grade of any talk show host
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:07.760]  but slowly but and surely politicians and and other leaders are starting to wake
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:13.600]  up and and fill that void thank god rand paul is one of them he was on fox news last night
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.520]  the story the video clips at info wars dot com we might we may play it coming up to
[1:01:20.320 --> 1:01:28.960]  vindicated rand paul blasts lying Fauci over civilization ending experiments exactly exactly
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:38.480]  that's what this is that's what fauci is they're mad scientists doing civilization ending experiments
[1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:42.800]  because they can and they laugh about it and scoff about it and they think they're so much better
[1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:49.040]  than everybody else and you can see their arrogance in the videos of fauci and dosik and and michael
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:52.240]  specter and the rest of them and i mean they literally say in the videos i mean that's what
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:02:00.560]  so frustrating is you know we're here every day for 10 hours a day breaking all of this down
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:06.800]  but it's like we don't have time to just rehash all of it every day to just add the backdrop to
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:11.120]  just add every detail to the bigger picture and every development so it's like if you
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:15.840]  don't follow it every day you're you're missing a lot different a lot of different elements and
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:27.440]  details and angles of the stories but when they get oh when they go on c span and they say michael
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:36.240]  specter says with dr fauci mind you and he says isn't it wouldn't it be better if more people died
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:43.520]  wouldn't it be better if more people died from the flu so that we could make them take vaccines
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:49.200]  wouldn't it be better if more died wouldn't that be better it's literally what he says
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:55.840]  that's like that's unbelievable shut up shroyer no that's real i don't have time to play you all
[1:02:55.840 --> 1:03:00.560]  these clips over and over and over again dosik bragging about gain of function fauci bragging
[1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:05.440]  about gain of function they're all on tape folks it's gonna be this this this when this trial
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:13.920]  goes down it's gonna take it not gonna take long because this isn't like the 1940s where
[1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:20.720]  it's harder to to pull up videos and commentary and documents no we're in the digital age now
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:29.120]  we've got it all we've got all your videos we've got all your documents and and and ran paul slowly
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:34.320]  but surely is getting to the point of no return which is where we need to go which is putting
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:45.040]  yourself in front of these diabolical mad scientists and saying no no more you are gonna
[1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:52.480]  have to go through me now saying fauci is doing civilization-ending experiments and that's exactly
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:56.880]  what he was doing and that's exactly what they're doing right now with this vaccine
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:05.200]  but oh see here's this headline at info wars cnn refuses to apologize to joe rogan over i've
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:09.120]  iver mekton smear and that's nice maybe they'll apologize to joe i'm sure they won't but how
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:16.720]  about cnn apologizes to america how about cnn apologizes to the world for lying about everything
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:25.120]  all day long i think cnn owes the entire planet an apology that includes joe rogan so does howard
[1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:31.840]  stern he calls nba player kairi Irving an idiot and a douchebag for refusing covet 19 and sacrificing
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:37.920]  millions of dollars no they should be praised they're heroes the athletes the coaches people
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:42.240]  that have sacrificed millions of dollars because they don't want to be part of a worldwide human
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:50.400]  experiment that that's character that's principal that's heroic that's courageous you're the coward
[1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:56.320]  power stern you're the idiot power stern you like cnn owe the world an apology
[1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:04.560]  alex jones here one of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology

[1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:45.520]  what's gonna happen as all these political prisoners are completely proven to be political
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:52.880]  prisoners as the lies of january 6 continue to be exposed and i've got more on that coming up
[1:06:52.880 --> 1:07:00.400]  but then you have the real criminals that unleashed a pandemic on the planet still walking free so
[1:07:00.400 --> 1:07:04.880]  what's it what's it what's it going to be like when all of this is undeniable and the real criminals
[1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:09.040]  on planet earth that just unleashed a pandemic on us and an experimental vaccine mandate
[1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:14.800]  are walking free while innocent political prisoners in the united states of america are
[1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:19.760]  still rotting behind bars what's that going to look like what is the response going to be like
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:26.960]  to that what what is that moment going to feel like because it's right around the corner i mean
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:32.480]  we we are we are reaching that that point or as alex called it yesterday that event horizon
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:36.720]  and really we've already crossed it really the event horizon has already been crossed it's already
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:45.440]  been realized but as usual most people are are late to the party and you know light and and sound
[1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:51.600]  and things take time to travel so but we really have i mean this is this is all inevitable it's
[1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:59.680]  all happening now and it's just a matter of time before the world has to deal with this and decide
[1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:04.080]  how we're going to go forward or maybe they'll or maybe we'll just give up maybe we'll just give in
[1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:08.480]  and just say yeah you know what the new world order defeated us we're done we're we're we're owned
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:12.320]  now we're corporate slaves now so just is what it is we don't want to fight this battle
[1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:17.840]  or there'll be righteous indignation and there'll be leaders that step up
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:22.240]  and actually want to stop this insanity stop this global government tyranny
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:24.880]  but in the meantime
[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:35.040]  you had biden at a fake town hall last night you said oh fake town hall what do you mean
[1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:41.840]  it wasn't a real town hall they kept the location secret so that you couldn't have thousands of
[1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:46.560]  biden protesters show up or thousands of trump supporters show up so they they they kept the
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:53.920]  location secret to avoid that and they didn't invite it wasn't an open audience they only
[1:08:53.920 --> 1:09:00.080]  invited a select people to come in so the whole thing was controlled and of course you know cnn's
[1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:06.320]  anderson cooper running it so that's not a real town hall the town wasn't invited they didn't even
[1:09:06.320 --> 1:09:11.280]  tell you where it was so yeah it was a fake town hall it was a staged event just like everything
[1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:16.960]  else they do like kamala harris walks into her surprise birthday party and shouts surprise what
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:23.600]  you couldn't be more fake if you were a three dollar bill or or kamala harris sitting down with
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:29.200]  kids talking about space and nasa it turns out they were all paid actors this is the
[1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:36.000]  fakest white house you've ever seen this is the most corrupt time in us history it's not even close
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:40.400]  it's off the scale it's like you know how we have the veirs charts with the vaccine deaths
[1:09:40.400 --> 1:09:44.960]  that's like off the charts right now just tens of thousands dead from vaccines it's never it's
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:49.360]  never been anywhere near that high it's like a professional baseball player hitting 500 home
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:55.520]  runs in a single season it's it's the same thing with how fake this white house is it's the same
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:01.840]  thing with how corrupt this this country is right now but so let's get into some of this here with
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:10.480]  biden i don't even know where to begin quite frankly i really don't
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:16.160]  joe biden when asked about going to the border last night
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:28.800]  he says he hasn't had time to go to the border even though he spent at least 70 days on vacation
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:34.640]  in delaware that we know of 70 days on vacation in delaware that we know of but he hasn't had time
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:38.480]  to go to the border and then he insists that joe biden went down there which i don't know why that
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:47.680]  matters to anybody or if it's even true he doesn't either joe biden's slack jawed as he confuses
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:52.240]  black congressman with black mayor during seeing in town hall boy wouldn't that be considered racist
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:11:00.560]  but no it's because biden doesn't know where he is he's suffering from severe mental deficiencies
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:09.280]  bumbling joe biden struggles to spit out answer on gas prices beg saudi arabia to bail out us
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:14.240]  after his actions has caused us prices to skyrocket and we've got that too he's a joke he's an
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:18.480]  embarrassment you should have seen his body language last night and let's go to some of it now
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:28.240]  uh first let's start with and this is this is just i'm so sick of this guys play clip five
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:34.480]  here's joe biden saying that it's time for the rich to pay their fair share now here's the deal
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:40.160]  though you have 55 corporations for example in the united states america making over 40 billion
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:47.600]  dollars don't pay a cent not a single little red cent yeah why is that i don't care i'm a capitalist
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:52.480]  oh i hope you can be a millionaire or a billionaire i'm not a pro but at least pay your fair share
[1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:58.880]  chip in a little bit and who are those corporations not paying their fair share joe oh that's right
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:05.920]  all the leftist corporations like google and apple that fund the democrat party and the republicans
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:14.160]  so it's all the liberal heads of these major corporations that don't pay the taxes that's
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:18.400]  why he doesn't call him out by name that's why he doesn't call the ceo's or the president's out
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:28.400]  by name because they're all democrats see how that works see how that works but you notice
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:34.400]  how they never there's there's no prerequisite here of a fair share what is a fair share
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:41.360]  what is a fair share how do you determine what a fair share is it's all rhetoric
[1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:48.720]  so that they can so that they can justify increasing taxes on the little guy meant to
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:53.520]  destroy the middle class and put everybody in poverty so that the rich continue to dominate
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.240]  and get richer which we saw that phenomenon in 2020 unlike any other year in human history
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:03.840]  there's never been a been a larger transfer of wealth in modern day history as there was in
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:11.920]  the year 2020 from either small businesses or the middle class to the top one percent of the one
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:18.160]  percent and he's right they don't pay taxes because they're all democrats they've all cut deals
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:23.120]  with the government but he doesn't name him and he doesn't say what a fair share is either
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:28.240]  because if he had to name him and if he had to say what a fair share was the whole thing would fall
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:36.480]  apart and it'd show how fraudulent they are and of course we all know the numbers the wealthy pay
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:40.800]  the most taxes it's not even close they pay beyond a fair share you know what a fair share would be
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:44.400]  how about nobody pays any taxes there you go that would end that problem but that won't be the case
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.480]  then the government can't control your life now let's go to clip three again folks the body language
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:59.040]  this guy was exhibiting last night i just don't even know what to say about it because i don't
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:04.080]  want to be insensitive to people that you know are suffering in their old age or people that
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:10.080]  actually have mental handicaps that can't help it but i mean he his behavior and body language at
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:16.480]  times was of a decrepit old person that literally doesn't know where they are crapping their pants
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:22.880]  can't think can't talk so here he is in clip three for for like i don't know how long was he literally
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:28.160]  just like froze and was just like holding his hands up like this just one of the many odd body
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:33.040]  language features from biden last night here it is in clip three about that with just in terms of
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:39.600]  inflation because what is he doing us at the town hall i think it was in july that the what is that
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:45.600]  near term inflation the wall street journal recently talks is like 67 financial experts who
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:52.160]  said that they they saw high inflation going all the way or deep into 2022 what what is he doing
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:59.200]  he's literally now i think what this is because i've kind of heard about this before but i i'm
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:05.360]  not sure a doctor would be better off to maybe explain this but i think what this is is when you
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:10.240]  get into old age and you kind of lose control of your mind or your body there's certain things
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:17.120]  that that doctors will tell you to do to try to get control back and so maybe that's what this was
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:22.720]  maybe him standing there and clenching his fists was was him trying to regain consciousness essentially
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:29.040]  or or maybe you know choke back a dump that was coming out but uh what is that
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:35.280]  and he had about three or four moments like that where he's just awkwardly like moving his hands
[1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:41.040]  or he's stiff as a board or he's leaning over like he's passed out what is all that
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:48.080]  can you imagine if donald trump was doing this weird behavior on a on a fake town hall
[1:15:48.080 --> 1:15:53.840]  they'd be oh he's sick look he's he's he's sick he can't think he can't walk we need to get him
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:16:01.760]  out of the white house oh but biden clearly deficient mentally nobody cares because of the

[1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:36.000]  Darwinistic system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:40.960]  destroy our children's futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open we really
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:48.800]  deserve what's happened to us so i asked you now are you going to step up and expose the
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:55.520]  dual order even more i know i'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts the front lines the fight
[1:17:55.520 --> 1:18:03.200]  is info wars.com it was almost 15 years ago that i released my seminal film in game blueprint for
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:08.240]  global enslavement and in that documentary i predicted the globalist would establish world
[1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:14.560]  government by releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering
[1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:20.320]  a collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it how did i know they would do it because
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:25.440]  they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal meetings were leaked
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:30.640]  you see then i was tracking the builder group who's head at the time was claus schwa
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:35.600]  and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:41.200]  reset well we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world and the first world
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:46.080]  done its ass is a tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship no due process
[1:18:46.880 --> 1:18:52.400]  destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections of poison mass
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:57.200]  creating these vaccines to poisonous in the populace this is what info wars is fighting
[1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:04.560]  we're fighting for the future cover commander here with an important message to humanity
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:12.000]  i have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe
[1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:23.280]  but the injection is not ready and so i need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days
[1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:31.840]  to flatten the cans i also need you to wear masks and i also need you to only shop at mega
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:40.560]  corporations that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies

[1:19:49.920 --> 1:19:56.000]  of freedom from cobra it will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  of your miserable lives you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:20:54.240 --> 1:20:59.040]  when a drug deal was going down she picked up the phone and called and say to the police officer
[1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:04.080]  with a cell phone that the drug deal is going down knowing that she would never be fingered
[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:09.440]  knowing that she would never be the one told that happened and so crime began to drop they had to
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:14.640]  know who the local liquor store they had to know and walk in and shake hands with the local minister
[1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:19.680]  they had to know that's i am corn hollyhock

[1:22:53.680 --> 1:23:02.800]  for my chinese communist but so here's the good news you know
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:10.720]  as bad as it may get for us and and the corruption and the lies and the media and the tyranny and
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:19.360]  everything this thing is going to sputter out folks this is not they can't win with leaders like
[1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:24.240]  joe biden justin trado
[1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:32.640]  and the rest of these goons that they have up there rachel levine they're not they win nothing
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:37.680]  so yeah you know what it's going to be real bad for us and i i i don't think we're going to have
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:40.880]  to put up with it for another two to three years and we're going to get the climate tyranny and
[1:23:40.880 --> 1:23:45.440]  it's just going to get worse and worse but you know what their their time is short and they know it
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:51.120]  but which is almost bad news too because then they may pull something off really desperate
[1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:56.640]  like starting world war three with china but they're totally exposed fouchies exposed biden
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:24:01.040]  isn't exposed ever the world is waking up to all of it the world is ready to take its destiny
[1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:08.720]  back the world is ready to take its future back and uh with clowns like biden in in the forefront
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:12.880]  as the face and the voice of the new world order there's no hope for them they know it's all said
[1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:17.200]  done with they're they're done so they're gonna have to launch a world war three type scenario
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:22.560]  if if there's not uh which there won't be if there if there's not a rest of these massive criminals
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:32.640]  but um just wow there's really all you can say to that really all you can say to that let's go
[1:24:32.640 --> 1:24:38.560]  here to another outrageous biden clip from last night biden holio here he is in clip four this
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:43.840]  is just i mean folks it's just unbelievable the lies that they can say straight faced it's just
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:48.560]  unbelievable how they can just make something up whole cloth just make something up and tell it to
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:55.760]  the american people on uh on a fake town hall stage listen to this in clip four like what they're
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:25:01.120]  saying about my buddy colin powell and he was my friend he passed away colin powell was vaccinated
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:07.360]  and he still died well he knew he had serious underlying conditions and it would be difficult
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:12.560]  he clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine really had he not gotten the
[1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:19.840]  the shots but my generic point is there's so much misinformation yeah you're you are the
[1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:26.720]  misinformation did you hear what he just said he clearly would have been alive or you know what was
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:30.960]  the exact quote that he said there he clearly would have been gone sooner if he didn't get the
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:35.200]  vaccine is that what it was hold on i want to get the exact quote let me let's roll this outrageous
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:38.880]  lie from joe biden one more time because i want to make sure i have the exact outrageous quote right
[1:25:38.880 --> 1:25:44.320]  here we go like what they're saying about my buddy colin powell my buddy corin pop passed away
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:50.240]  colin powell was vaccinated he still died well he knew he had serious underlying conditions
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:55.840]  and it would be difficult he clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:00.960]  there it was okay he clearly would have been gone earlier if he'd not gotten the vaccine do you
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:07.600]  realize how asinine that is do you do you realize how ridiculous that is the vaccine is now a light
[1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:12.960]  it saves your life from anything now the vaccine now extends your life if you have cancer or anything
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:16.480]  oh you've been marked with a terminal illness you're going to die in march but if you get the
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:24.320]  covid vaccine you might make it to june what that's outrageous what a bold faced that's not even a lie
[1:26:24.320 --> 1:26:31.280]  that's literally just pulling something out of your ass but but see how think about how
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:38.720]  think about the the real gravity of what he just said though first he admits that colin powell
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:44.960]  vaccinated died from covid so the vaccine doesn't work i mean that that should be it right there
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:51.360]  then he admits well he actually had all these underlying conditions so actually he didn't
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:55.360]  die from covid he died from cancer and this other stuff or whatever he had so again it's
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:59.600]  okay the vaccines don't work and then it's the numbers are all skewed because we just claim
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:03.120]  everything is coveted every death is coveted even though it's cancer or all these other things
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:09.920]  and then after accidentally showing the world the truth which most probably couldn't even see
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:17.200]  or hear the vaccine doesn't work might kill you and it's not really covid that are killing
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:21.600]  all these people it's just all these other conditions but then he has to cover it up with
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:28.320]  an outrageous statement that colin powell lived longer because he was vaccinated what an outrageous
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:33.520]  lie with nothing to back it up at all
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:40.640]  this biden guy is a real piece of you know what
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:51.840]  and now here's some of the latest from our from our criminal president
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:01.520]  i'll tell you he says he makes this statement today climate change is an existential threat
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:11.200]  to humanity there it is there it is the next big scare tactic to conquer you using fear that's why
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:18.160]  i'm making a commitment to get to net zero emissions on electric power by 2035 and uh
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:23.120]  you're making that commitment you you're not going to be here and net zero emissions across the
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:28.720]  board by 2050 or before do you realize what that means right that means no humans left on earth
[1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:38.960]  net zero net zero so that either means that you're going to live in a cave eating raw raw meat that
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:46.080]  you hunt with with sticks and rocks or you're going to be dead that's what net zero means either
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:52.400]  you're going to live in a cave trying to start fires with with sticks and hunt with rocks or
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:29:00.240]  you're all going to be dead that's what net zero means attention radio listeners i am taping this

[1:29:55.440 --> 1:30:03.440]  out early next week info or store dot com the technocrats the social engineers the behavioral
[1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:10.160]  psychologists they're all part of the same satanic globalist control freak system that
[1:30:10.160 --> 1:30:17.040]  seeks to play god the seeks to turn the general population of this earth into their slaves
[1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:23.440]  into putty into clay in their hands that they control and chief amongst their physical attacks
[1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:28.400]  is keeping us from high quality vitamins and minerals that are essential for life on this
[1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:34.880]  planet and so the information we cover exposes their evil works and sabotages their globalist
[1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:39.600]  takeover and we're having an incredible effect thanks to your support and your word of mouth but
[1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:44.400]  it's also important to take care of our bodies themselves with high quality water filtration
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:48.960]  at info or store dot com and with amazing supplements many of which that just came back
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:54.560]  in this time like bodies ultimate turmeric formula now 40 off for a limited time at info
[1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:59.600]  or store dot com so let's fight the info war but also take care of our bodies we've all heard about
[1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:05.680]  the pastor and his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when
[1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:09.840]  they came for one group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they
[1:31:09.840 --> 1:31:13.920]  came for another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally
[1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:18.320]  when they came for him there was nobody else to stand up well the global social credit score
[1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:22.560]  that china is putting in it's banning people to three hours of video games a week and if you
[1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:27.040]  criticize the government you can never buy or sell again well that's that's being brought here
[1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:31.920]  and all over the world under the guise of covid vaccine passports they even admit it now there's
[1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:36.400]  there's going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do and
[1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:41.360]  decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that
[1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:47.120]  you'll accept anything so again the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny
[1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:50.480]  pretending like they're part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this
[1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:54.960]  nightmare as well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will
[1:31:54.960 --> 1:32:00.480]  be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists so when i first started taking
[1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:05.600]  survival shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:10.800]  believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so
[1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:15.600]  the first one i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then
[1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:19.520]  shortly thereafter you came out with x2 you had you know with a deep burden source you know and i
[1:32:19.520 --> 1:32:24.800]  got really excited about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like
[1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:30.800]  literally like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:36.240]  and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically
[1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:40.880]  all of your supplements they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is
[1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:45.680]  knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:50.400]  point is we have to get ourselves clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only
[1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:55.520]  way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother i thank you so
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:04.000]  much for your call and godspeed you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:47.680]  that as many as one in three emergency responders in some cities like chicago
[1:33:47.680 --> 1:33:54.160]  los angeles right here in baltimore are refusing to comply with city vaccine mandates i'm wondering
[1:33:54.160 --> 1:34:00.240]  where you stand on that should police officers emergency responders be mandated to get vaccines
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:07.760]  and if not should they be stay at home or let go yes and yes by the way
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:18.160]  wow and they cheer the fake crowd i waited until uh july to talk about mandating you know
[1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:26.400]  what that's enough shut him down i can't stand him folks if i told you i was a time traveler
[1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:34.320]  would you believe me i mean i'm telling you where this goes okay right now it's

[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:55.280]  prisoners but well absolutely you know where it goes next right hey these people won't comply with
[1:34:55.280 --> 1:35:06.400]  our uh climate mandates do you think they should be killed and slaughtered yes and yes yeah that's
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:13.600]  where it goes next folks that's where it goes next you better damn well believe it they consider you
[1:35:13.600 --> 1:35:18.960]  a threat they consider you a virus they consider you a parasite they consider you a cancer on this
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:28.560]  planet and if you do not abide by their authoritarian dictate then you should be killed because being a
[1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:33.200]  prisoner is not enough you see because even if you're a prisoner you're still adding to the
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:39.600]  carbon emissions so they are just going to have to kill you oh you oh you think that we're above
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:46.160]  that you think that we're beyond that in the 21st century guess again bud oh it won't be long not
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:52.240]  with this brainwashed cult not with this corrupt leadership they'll up an outright say should we
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:57.600]  start killing people that don't obey by carbon emission laws and they'll say yes and they will
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:06.720]  cheer it they will cheer it we may even live to see that folks you may even live to see that moment
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:11.120]  because you would have never believed you would have never believed if someone would have told you
[1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:15.440]  that you're going to have a day where americans are going to celebrate political prisoners
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:22.880]  when americans are going to celebrate forced experimental medicines and if you don't take them
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:28.080]  you can't travel you can't work you can't do nothing you would have never thought you would
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:33.840]  see the day in america where that would be celebrated here you are here you are and guess what
[1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:39.280]  they're not stopping the train is still on the tracks and it's only gaining speed
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:46.800]  human history always repeats itself you you may actually see the day i hope it
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:51.360]  doesn't get to this point but we may we may actually see the day hell i might be the one
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:56.640]  they kill but you may actually see the day where they just start killing people that they disagree
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:01.600]  with politically or that won't abide by their climate tyranny and they'll say should we kill
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:07.040]  those people and and bidener kamala harris will say yes we should and they'll all break out into
[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:13.840]  applause you may actually see that day that's how bad it is
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:22.800]  but this biden can't stop lying he makes this statement i ran for president for three reasons
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:27.840]  to restore the soul and decency of our country okay you failed there to rebuild our economy
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:31.760]  from the bottom up in the middle out what does that even mean well either way you still failed
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:37.920]  there too and to help unite our country so 0 for 3 and then he says but he says we're on the right
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:46.880]  track what i think this guy is such a lonely tune man seriously this is a cartoon cartoon world
[1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:52.240]  and uh the amazing thing about this though is guys if you pull up the actual tweet
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:38:00.400]  the amazing thing about this is it's like all the replies are saying how he's failed
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:04.320]  how he's horrible how he's the worst how he needs to be arrested it's just it's it's wild to see
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:13.040]  it really is wild to see i mean i could do entire shows every day that would be
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:20.400]  extremely entertaining by just going off one or two of these tweets and just reading the replies
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:26.240]  i mean it would i could fill three hours a day no problem and it would be so entertaining
[1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:35.440]  but there you go so so there's biden just lying through his teeth but just being completely rejected
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:41.440]  by the american people and uh the crew's trying to find that one yeah there it is
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:48.400]  and you can just see all the negative replies and the let's go brandons which by the way
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:53.840]  they're about to pull a switcheroo on let's go brandon so i guess we might as well just tell
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:39:00.160]  you that that's coming here too today uh we have the clip let's let's go to let me see here
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:02.880]  do we do we have the clip here guys
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:12.880]  do we have the brandon clip guys from biden it's not on the video list but
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:18.240]  scott gave me this you know what we may have to cover this later if we don't have it it's okay but
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:26.800]  um they are now they now have their plan to pull the old switcheroo on the let's go brandon chant
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:32.160]  and so we'll get that video and we'll show you what they're going to do uh it's just sick these
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:38.400]  people are so sick and evil but it just shows that let's go brandon was effective so phony kamala
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:44.960]  harris musters fake southern accent during campaign speeds for terry mccullough oh boy i don't have
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:49.280]  that video in here but i kind of been interested in seeing that so kamala harris we've got a border
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:54.960]  crisis we've got an economic crisis we got a supply chain crisis and what kamala harris doing
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:59.440]  she's campaigning for democrats in virginia that's you know because that's what the vice president's
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:04.080]  duty is to campaign for other democrats what it's all about folks don't you know didn't you know that
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:10.080]  how are things going for terry mccullough anyway well he just got a $100,000 donation from a
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:17.760]  jeff rieppstein associate who owns a plane called the uh the f jet i'm censoring myself here so he's
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:23.040]  you know he's big into by and i'm sure biden's big into that too the f jet terry mccullough gets
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:26.480]  a hundred thousand dollar donation from jeff rieppstein associate who owns a plane called
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:34.720]  the bang jet put it like that how about that how about that by the way i'm telling you this
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:43.360]  this you know it'd be it'd be a lot nicer if uh i didn't have the federal government trying to
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:49.440]  destroy my life and a bunch of liars in the media trying to trying to help in that effort
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:53.200]  because this i mean honestly like i could come up here and have fun with this and laugh i mean
[1:40:53.200 --> 1:41:04.720]  this is hilarious comical stuff like this so terry mccullough came out last year and said
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:10.160]  that ralph northam should be removed from office because he wore blackface so you know ralph northam
[1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:18.320]  famous famous for wearing blackface but then he had ralph northam come and promote his campaign
[1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:22.400]  and he hugged and shook his hand and said how great he was so wait he's he's racist and bigoted
[1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:26.560]  because he wore blackface needs to resign to oh now he's gonna help me campaign he's great
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:31.360]  but it's even funnier than that and and young kin the guy running against him points it out
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:38.000]  the guy running for attorney general right now you may have heard of mark herring also wore
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  blackface another democrat two democrats in the virginia government both wore blackface
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:54.080]  northam and mark herring i mean you you can't make this stuff up man this is this is this is
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:59.520]  like a comedy movie or something they're all wearing blackface but telling you how racist you are
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:05.760]  just outrageous just outrageous is this the kamala hair's accent video guys
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:11.680]  look at how phony this woman is this is the phoniest woman you're ever gonna see in your life
[1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:20.080]  but like a bad actress though like a horrible actress like she would try out for parts and
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:26.320]  movies and not get a single one because she's so disingenuous i can't even stand this i can't
[1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:35.280]  even look at her all right when we come back i'm gonna pile drive into more of this news
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:43.520]  news and now they just say what we told you all along if you want your freedom you have to get
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:47.760]  vaccinated now they're just saying it so your freedom isn't given by god it's given by the
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:52.640]  government now see they own you the government owns you the corporate world government is going
[1:42:52.640 --> 1:43:02.400]  to own your ass that's that's what they want the globalist or bomb i want to explain something
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:06.720]  that is absolutely feed understanding our world that's very very simple but the most of all don't
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:13.920]  know the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of
[1:43:13.920 --> 1:43:21.280]  trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure intellectual
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:28.640]  property energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence and in the past they created
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:32.880]  thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:37.520]  allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:43.120]  now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:49.040]  up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and force the
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:54.160]  collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund the only things left standing
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:58.400]  this is the great reset this is what's happening now for everyone is the only way to stop it

[1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:47.580]  This news is breaking right now, it just keeps getting worse for Fauci, but this is actually
[1:47:47.580 --> 1:47:51.500]  an old story, it's just everybody's picking it up today for some reason, I guess because
[1:47:51.500 --> 1:47:56.380]  now that everybody knows Fauci's caught red-handed starting the pandemic.
[1:47:56.380 --> 1:48:04.300]  WCW investigation, Fauci wasted more than $1 million to poison beagle puppies and chop
[1:48:04.300 --> 1:48:11.500]  them up, and I mean, folks, could this guy be more evil?
[1:48:11.500 --> 1:48:12.500]  What are we going to find out next?
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:18.020]  He's directly involved with studying aborted fetal cells and cutting babies up, too?
[1:48:18.020 --> 1:48:19.020]  Is that what's next?
[1:48:19.020 --> 1:48:20.020]  What's next?
[1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:26.660]  Anthony Fauci funded research involving injecting and force-feeding 44 beagle puppies, toxic
[1:48:26.660 --> 1:48:33.740]  drugs, then killing and dissecting them.
[1:48:33.740 --> 1:48:42.340]  This guy is an evil scientist, man, this is like Hannibal Lecter stuff.
[1:48:42.340 --> 1:48:50.500]  And they put that guy on TV, he's the top-paid person in our government, oh my god, oh my
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:49:09.620]  god, folks, we all know, we've fallen, man, this is just, that is probably the telltale
[1:49:09.620 --> 1:49:14.500]  sign that you are living in the most corrupt time in US history, but it's beyond that.
[1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:21.820]  How evil and sadistic it really is, that Fauci, the top-paid member of our government who's
[1:49:21.820 --> 1:49:30.900]  been around for almost 50 years, cuts up puppies, poisons and chops up puppies, number one
[1:49:30.900 --> 1:49:37.900]  paid government official, poisons and cuts up puppies, does biological weapons research,
[1:49:37.900 --> 1:49:44.140]  promotes pandemics, lies about everything, promotes deadly AIDS medicines that kill people,
[1:49:44.140 --> 1:49:49.980]  I mean, we all know the world is corrupt, we can all see how evil the world has gotten,
[1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:54.540]  I mean, does that not put it all into perspective right there?
[1:49:54.540 --> 1:49:59.940]  Does that not put it all into perspective, Fauci poisoning and chopping up dogs?
[1:49:59.940 --> 1:50:07.580]  What more do you need to know about this freak?
[1:50:07.580 --> 1:50:10.740]  Let's do this, let's go to clip 10.
[1:50:10.740 --> 1:50:14.340]  This is out of the UK telling you what we told you already.
[1:50:14.340 --> 1:50:18.420]  You want to be a free citizen, you want to have rights, you want to have anything, you
[1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:22.220]  got to take experimental medication first, which of course shows you're a slave, you're
[1:50:22.220 --> 1:50:25.380]  not free at all, if you don't even have control of your own body, that's the point, but here
[1:50:25.380 --> 1:50:29.540]  they are saying it in clip 10.
[1:50:29.540 --> 1:50:34.060]  We've always known that the winter months would pose the greatest threat to our road
[1:50:34.060 --> 1:50:35.700]  to recovery.
[1:50:35.700 --> 1:50:41.740]  The darker skies, the colder weather provide perfect conditions, not just for COVID-19
[1:50:41.740 --> 1:50:48.220]  to thrive, but for other seasonal viruses too, like flu and norovirus.
[1:50:48.220 --> 1:50:53.420]  And ahead of winter, just as we expected, we're starting to see this impact.
[1:50:53.420 --> 1:50:57.620]  Even though they're all vaccinated, cases are rising and they could go yet as high as
[1:50:57.620 --> 1:51:04.180]  100,000 a day, the NHS performing with distinction, and I'd like to thank everyone who's working
[1:51:04.180 --> 1:51:08.020]  so hard to keep us safe.
[1:51:08.020 --> 1:51:13.700]  And we'll do what it takes to make sure that this pressure does not become unsustainable
[1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:17.780]  and that we don't allow the NHS to become overwhelmed.
[1:51:17.780 --> 1:51:20.220]  This pandemic is not over.
[1:51:20.220 --> 1:51:21.380]  Oh, okay.
[1:51:21.380 --> 1:51:22.900]  Thanks to the vaccination program.
[1:51:22.900 --> 1:51:23.900]  Yes, the link.
[1:51:23.900 --> 1:51:26.860]  Hold on, that's a deposit right there.
[1:51:26.860 --> 1:51:29.380]  We need to just cut that out right there.
[1:51:29.380 --> 1:51:30.380]  That's the goal.
[1:51:30.380 --> 1:51:35.500]  This pandemic is not over thanks to the vaccination program, bingo, bingo.
[1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:36.500]  You nailed it.
[1:51:36.500 --> 1:51:37.500]  That's it.
[1:51:37.500 --> 1:51:38.500]  That's all you need to know.
[1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:39.500]  That's the greatest truth he's ever told.
[1:51:39.500 --> 1:51:47.140]  But see, there's this notion that is so sick, so twisted, so inorganic, so satanic.
[1:51:47.140 --> 1:51:48.620]  We do not consent.
[1:51:48.620 --> 1:51:50.780]  We do not consent to you running our lives.
[1:51:50.780 --> 1:51:53.460]  We do not consent to you making health decisions for us.
[1:51:53.460 --> 1:51:56.300]  We do not consent to you deciding when we can be free.
[1:51:56.300 --> 1:51:58.980]  We do not consent to you deciding when we need to be in fear.
[1:51:58.980 --> 1:52:00.220]  We don't consent to all of it.
[1:52:00.220 --> 1:52:03.380]  Who do you think you are that you get to run our lives?
[1:52:03.380 --> 1:52:08.020]  Who do you think you are that you get to make decisions for us, whether it's health or travel
[1:52:08.020 --> 1:52:09.020]  or anything?
[1:52:09.020 --> 1:52:12.300]  Who do you think you are?
[1:52:12.300 --> 1:52:16.780]  You're a bunch of sick, control freak tyrants.
[1:52:16.780 --> 1:52:24.500]  You are the offspring spiritually of Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong and Pol Pot and the
[1:52:24.500 --> 1:52:28.060]  worst murderous regime dictators ever.
[1:52:28.060 --> 1:52:29.700]  You are their sole spawn.
[1:52:29.700 --> 1:52:31.220]  You are their spirit spawn.
[1:52:31.220 --> 1:52:36.420]  They still live through you thinking that you have some sort of ordained right to control
[1:52:36.420 --> 1:52:37.420]  our lives.
[1:52:37.420 --> 1:52:38.420]  We do not consent.
[1:52:38.420 --> 1:52:40.020]  We don't want you running our lives.
[1:52:40.020 --> 1:52:41.980]  We don't give a damn what you had to say.
[1:52:41.980 --> 1:52:45.020]  We're not going to live in fear just because you tell us to.
[1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:49.820]  Boy, let me just finish up the clip.
[1:52:49.820 --> 1:52:54.100]  Because here comes, you can't be free unless you take the vaccine.
[1:52:54.100 --> 1:52:56.300]  Finish up the clip.
[1:52:56.300 --> 1:53:03.540]  Decisions and deaths has significantly weakened, but it's not broken.
[1:53:03.540 --> 1:53:09.420]  So we must all remember that this virus will be with us for the long term and that it remains
[1:53:09.420 --> 1:53:10.420]  a threat.
[1:53:10.420 --> 1:53:11.420]  Nope.
[1:53:11.420 --> 1:53:15.860]  A threat to our loved ones and a threat to the progress that we've made in getting our
[1:53:15.860 --> 1:53:17.940]  nation closer to normal life.
[1:53:17.940 --> 1:53:18.940]  You're a threat.
[1:53:18.940 --> 1:53:19.940]  Normal life.
[1:53:19.940 --> 1:53:24.540]  We're looking closely at the data and we won't be implementing our plan B of contingency measures
[1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:32.340]  at this point, but we'll be staying vigilant, preparing for all eventualities while strengthening
[1:53:32.340 --> 1:53:40.020]  our vital defenses that can help us fight back against this virus.
[1:53:40.020 --> 1:53:41.020]  That's weird.
[1:53:41.020 --> 1:53:44.580]  I must have missed the part where he says, if you want to keep your freedoms, you have
[1:53:44.580 --> 1:53:45.580]  to take the vaccine.
[1:53:45.580 --> 1:53:46.580]  That's fine.
[1:53:46.580 --> 1:53:48.820]  I can't waste any more time on it, but you know what we should do?
[1:53:48.820 --> 1:53:54.180]  We should isolate that clip out where he says, thanks to the vaccination program, the
[1:53:54.180 --> 1:53:55.780]  pandemic will never end.
[1:53:55.780 --> 1:53:58.300]  I mean, that's just hilarious because that's it.
[1:53:58.300 --> 1:53:59.300]  That's what it is.
[1:53:59.300 --> 1:54:02.900]  The vaccine has destroyed your immune systems and all the new hospitalizations in COVID
[1:54:02.900 --> 1:54:05.860]  cases are vaccinated people.
[1:54:05.860 --> 1:54:06.860]  That's it.
[1:54:06.860 --> 1:54:07.860]  All right.
[1:54:07.860 --> 1:54:17.180]  Let me just take a deep breath here because I'm just, I'm really revved up right now.
[1:54:17.180 --> 1:54:18.180]  All right.
[1:54:18.180 --> 1:54:19.180]  Let's see what we have here.
[1:54:19.180 --> 1:54:20.180]  What else do we have here?
[1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:22.700]  Oh, this is funny.
[1:54:22.700 --> 1:54:27.260]  The Democrats just, they just lie so boldly and they just assume nobody ever know it.
[1:54:27.260 --> 1:54:29.020]  Well, their constituents will never know it.
[1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:31.340]  They're idiots, but the rest of us will.
[1:54:31.340 --> 1:54:37.500]  So here's Elaine Lauria responding to Glenn Yonkin, again, running for governor in Virginia
[1:54:37.500 --> 1:54:41.220]  who says George Soros is funding his opposition, which is just true.
[1:54:41.220 --> 1:54:42.220]  It's all on record.
[1:54:42.220 --> 1:54:43.900]  I mean, it's campaign finance funds.
[1:54:43.900 --> 1:54:49.260]  And so Elaine Lauria from Virginia, she works in the government, she says, I call it out
[1:54:49.260 --> 1:54:54.420]  in my own party and I'm calling it out now evoking George Soros as a shadowy fundraiser
[1:54:54.420 --> 1:54:59.660]  is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory and it's unacceptable from Glenn Yonkin.
[1:54:59.660 --> 1:55:01.460]  Oh, oh, okay.
[1:55:01.460 --> 1:55:04.820]  So George Soros, the guy that works with the Nazis, it's anti-Semitic to say he's a bad
[1:55:04.820 --> 1:55:06.860]  guy, but that's not even it.
[1:55:06.860 --> 1:55:11.060]  It's anti-Semitic to even say he funds political campaigns, which he does to the tunes of millions
[1:55:11.060 --> 1:55:12.060]  of dollars.
[1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:16.580]  So Matt walking just went ahead and pulled up the documents and here's George Soros giving
[1:55:16.580 --> 1:55:24.020]  $5,000 to pack to the future, which right after that donation was made, gave $5,000
[1:55:24.020 --> 1:55:25.780]  to Elaine Lauria's campaign.
[1:55:25.780 --> 1:55:28.420]  So she's funded by George Soros.
[1:55:28.420 --> 1:55:30.500]  It's all on record.
[1:55:30.500 --> 1:55:32.540]  It's literally on record.
[1:55:32.540 --> 1:55:37.820]  She's funded by George Soros, but she says you're not allowed to say George Soros' name
[1:55:37.820 --> 1:55:39.660]  or you're an anti-Semitic.
[1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:49.660]  You know, the guy that ran around with the Nazis to round up Jews.
[1:55:49.660 --> 1:55:51.380]  I just don't want to live.
[1:55:51.380 --> 1:55:58.340]  See, these people, you know, hey, these clowns, these liars, these corrupt minions, these,
[1:55:58.340 --> 1:55:59.660]  they have every right to live.
[1:55:59.660 --> 1:56:00.660]  Fine.
[1:56:00.660 --> 1:56:01.660]  You guys can live.
[1:56:01.660 --> 1:56:02.660]  I want you to live.
[1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:03.660]  Live a life.
[1:56:03.660 --> 1:56:04.660]  Play your little games.
[1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:06.820]  Weave your web of little lies.
[1:56:06.820 --> 1:56:07.820]  Do all your things.
[1:56:07.820 --> 1:56:09.940]  Please just leave us alone.
[1:56:09.940 --> 1:56:11.740]  We're so sick and tired of you.
[1:56:11.740 --> 1:56:14.220]  We just want to be free and prosperous and live in America again.
[1:56:14.220 --> 1:56:15.220]  That's all.
[1:56:15.220 --> 1:56:16.220]  It's really not that big of a deal.
[1:56:16.220 --> 1:56:19.020]  We just want to live our lives without you being involved.
[1:56:19.020 --> 1:56:20.620]  It doesn't mean we want you to die.
[1:56:20.620 --> 1:56:21.620]  Go live your life.
[1:56:21.620 --> 1:56:22.620]  Go play games with one another.
[1:56:22.620 --> 1:56:23.620]  Go lie to one another.
[1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:24.740]  Go play games with your kids.
[1:56:24.740 --> 1:56:28.020]  Let them, let them have pedophiles bounce up and down on their laps.
[1:56:28.020 --> 1:56:30.500]  You know, let them, let them, let pedophiles rape them in bathrooms.
[1:56:30.500 --> 1:56:31.700]  You do your thing.
[1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:32.700]  You do your thing.
[1:56:32.700 --> 1:56:34.780]  You live in a communist satanic hellhole.
[1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:35.780]  That's your thing.
[1:56:35.780 --> 1:56:36.780]  You go ahead and do it.
[1:56:36.780 --> 1:56:37.780]  We don't want it.
[1:56:37.780 --> 1:56:38.780]  Stop.
[1:56:38.780 --> 1:56:39.780]  We're done with you.
[1:56:39.780 --> 1:56:40.780]  We want, we want nothing to do with you.
[1:56:40.780 --> 1:56:42.380]  We want nothing to do with your medical tyranny.
[1:56:42.380 --> 1:56:44.140]  We want nothing to do with your climate tyranny.
[1:56:44.140 --> 1:56:46.340]  We want nothing to do with your sexual perversion.
[1:56:46.340 --> 1:56:48.340]  We want nothing to do with you controlling us.
[1:56:48.340 --> 1:56:49.340]  Nothing.
[1:56:49.340 --> 1:56:50.340]  We're done.
[1:56:50.340 --> 1:56:51.340]  We're opting out.
[1:56:51.340 --> 1:56:52.340]  We do not consent.
[1:56:52.340 --> 1:56:53.340]  But you're tyrants.
[1:56:53.340 --> 1:56:55.940]  So you won't let go, will you?
[1:56:55.940 --> 1:56:59.980]  You have to control us because you know you're living a lie.
[1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:06.980]  And the only way that your lie becomes truth is if you conquer the world with your lies.
[1:57:06.980 --> 1:57:08.580]  We want nothing to do with you.
[1:57:08.580 --> 1:57:09.740]  Please leave us alone.
[1:57:09.740 --> 1:57:11.260]  Please for the love of God.
[1:57:11.260 --> 1:57:12.660]  Please for the love of God.
[1:57:12.660 --> 1:57:14.340]  You lunatics.
[1:57:14.340 --> 1:57:16.780]  You lunatics on the left in this country.
[1:57:16.780 --> 1:57:17.780]  Leave us alone.
[1:57:17.780 --> 1:57:19.060]  That's all we ask.
[1:57:19.060 --> 1:57:20.620]  Just leave us alone.
[1:57:20.620 --> 1:57:21.900]  Play your little games.
[1:57:21.900 --> 1:57:23.260]  Play medical tyranny.
[1:57:23.260 --> 1:57:26.020]  Play experimental vaccines.
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:27.660]  Play climate tyranny.
[1:57:27.660 --> 1:57:29.020]  Play all your fake news.
[1:57:29.020 --> 1:57:30.020]  Play all day long.
[1:57:30.020 --> 1:57:31.020]  I don't care.
[1:57:31.020 --> 1:57:32.660]  Go LARP all day long in your little fantasy world.
[1:57:32.660 --> 1:57:33.660]  We don't want to live in it.
[1:57:33.660 --> 1:57:35.940]  Do you get that?
[1:57:35.940 --> 1:57:38.340]  Please just leave us alone.
[1:57:38.340 --> 1:57:40.740]  Leave the children alone for the love of God.
[1:57:40.740 --> 1:57:42.940]  You sick satanic freaks.
[1:57:42.940 --> 1:57:54.740]  If you're listening to this message in the weekend of Friday, October 22nd, 2021, this

[1:58:14.900 --> 1:58:17.940]  key ingredients that God gave us through nature that are simply amazing.

[1:58:22.380 --> 1:58:25.580]  chain breakdowns because we would not cut the quality of the ingredients.
[1:58:25.580 --> 1:58:29.060]  We could cut the quality all day and buy crap from China and never be sold out.
[1:58:29.060 --> 1:58:30.060]  We're not doing that.
[1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:31.820]  This is the highest rated.

[1:58:40.540 --> 1:58:41.540]  It's 25% off.
[1:58:41.540 --> 1:58:45.140]  So support the M4 while getting great products at the same time.
[1:58:45.140 --> 1:58:46.820]  Thank you all for your support.
[1:58:46.820 --> 1:58:47.820]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:58:47.820 --> 1:58:50.340]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:51.940]  Why do the globalists take you so much?
[1:58:51.940 --> 1:58:55.140]  Why do they hate America so much?
[1:58:55.140 --> 1:59:00.980]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot
[1:59:00.980 --> 1:59:01.980]  coexist with.
[1:59:01.980 --> 1:59:03.140]  It's very, very simple.
[1:59:03.140 --> 1:59:09.820]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenics system to flourish, freedom
[1:59:09.820 --> 1:59:15.820]  and liberty and due process and justice and God fearing systems must fail.
[1:59:15.820 --> 1:59:18.380]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[1:59:18.380 --> 1:59:21.340]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:23.260]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[1:59:23.260 --> 1:59:28.180]  They started a fight with you and they're not going to back down and they're not going
[1:59:28.180 --> 1:59:29.180]  to go away.
[1:59:29.180 --> 1:59:35.460]  They're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of God put into them.
[1:59:35.460 --> 1:59:39.540]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order or about globalism
[1:59:39.540 --> 1:59:40.540]  or about corporate fascism.
[1:59:40.540 --> 1:59:45.780]  And it's not until people understand that and that we're underattacked with any chance
[1:59:45.780 --> 1:59:50.340]  of beating these people.
[1:59:50.340 --> 1:59:56.900]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:56.900 --> 2:00:11.900]  All right, doing my best channeling of the Alex Jones energy here today.
[2:00:11.900 --> 2:00:19.180]  But I guess that's just how we all feel at times, isn't it?
[2:00:19.180 --> 2:00:23.900]  Going with all this corruption and lying that we deal with in the clown world.
[2:00:23.900 --> 2:00:29.420]  The great Mark Dice is about to join us and he has, I mean, just the guy's been doing
[2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:31.020]  unbelievable work for years.
[2:00:31.020 --> 2:00:37.940]  But boy, oh boy, if anybody shows how dumb the population is and it's sad to see, it's
[2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:39.940]  Mark Dice out in California.
[2:00:39.940 --> 2:00:44.780]  Here's the latest, greatest from Mark Dice where people are convinced, I don't know
[2:00:44.780 --> 2:00:46.380]  how we've gotten to this point.
[2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:49.980]  I mean, I guess they believe in coronavirus killing all these people.
[2:00:49.980 --> 2:00:53.100]  So maybe they'll believe in triceratops existing now.
[2:00:53.100 --> 2:00:55.180]  So let's find out from Mark Dice.
[2:00:55.180 --> 2:00:57.220]  Do people believe in triceratops?
[2:00:57.220 --> 2:01:01.860]  You an animal lover, we're trying to save the triceratops.
[2:01:01.860 --> 2:01:07.460]  A lot of people out there, Joe Rogan just killed one and we're trying to stop them from hunting
[2:01:07.460 --> 2:01:08.460]  them.
[2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:09.660]  We're just adding them to the endangered species list.
[2:01:09.660 --> 2:01:14.260]  So just name birth it in the signature to help to support the cause, please.
[2:01:14.260 --> 2:01:19.780]  Just, you know, a lot of these big game hunters are out there killing them for sport, Prince
[2:01:19.780 --> 2:01:22.700]  birthday in the signature.
[2:01:22.700 --> 2:01:27.140]  Joe Rogan just killed one and a lot of these celebrity hunters go out there.
[2:01:27.140 --> 2:01:28.660]  Can I say anything here about it?
[2:01:28.660 --> 2:01:29.660]  Oh, yeah.
[2:01:29.660 --> 2:01:32.380]  Add the triceratops to endangered species.
[2:01:32.380 --> 2:01:35.100]  Joe Rogan just killed one just for fun.
[2:01:35.100 --> 2:01:40.860]  He's going to hang the head in his office and a lot of these big game hunters are out there
[2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:44.500]  killing the triceratops just for sport.
[2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:45.500]  And so...
[2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:46.500]  Oh, you don't have to.
[2:01:46.500 --> 2:01:47.500]  Oh, good.
[2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:50.900]  Yeah, birthday, yeah, signature there too, yeah.
[2:01:50.900 --> 2:01:56.420]  So adding the triceratops on the endangered species list will help preserve the ones that
[2:01:56.420 --> 2:01:57.420]  are left.
[2:01:57.420 --> 2:01:59.860]  I'm all about saving the animals.
[2:01:59.860 --> 2:02:00.860]  Saving the animals.
[2:02:00.860 --> 2:02:01.860]  I'm a vegetarian.
[2:02:01.860 --> 2:02:02.860]  Oh, you're a vegetarian.
[2:02:02.860 --> 2:02:03.860]  Thank you.
[2:02:03.860 --> 2:02:09.180]  Yeah, there's not really that many of them around anymore, the triceratops, and so adding
[2:02:09.180 --> 2:02:15.660]  them to the endangered species list will stop people from hunting the triceratops.
[2:02:15.660 --> 2:02:20.180]  People like Ted Nugent out there trying to get a trophy kill, so we're going to stop
[2:02:20.180 --> 2:02:21.180]  that.
[2:02:21.180 --> 2:02:22.180]  All right.
[2:02:22.180 --> 2:02:23.180]  Thank you, sir.
[2:02:23.180 --> 2:02:27.420]  I mean, it would be one thing if people were hunting the triceratops for food, but these
[2:02:27.420 --> 2:02:30.620]  people are hunting them just for fun.
[2:02:30.620 --> 2:02:35.460]  And so we're going to have to add them to the endangered species list to make sure that
[2:02:35.460 --> 2:02:38.140]  nobody can get a permit to go and kill anymore.
[2:02:38.140 --> 2:02:39.780]  Hey, you like my shirt?
[2:02:39.780 --> 2:02:43.500]  Order yours from my online store at markdays.com or click the link in the description below.
[2:02:43.500 --> 2:02:48.980]  You know, these people go hunting them for sport, the triceratops, and there's even talk
[2:02:48.980 --> 2:02:53.220]  that Burger King is going to start adding a triceratops burger to the menu, and there's
[2:02:53.220 --> 2:02:57.340]  not that many of them out there, and so we're going to add them to the endangered species
[2:02:57.340 --> 2:02:59.820]  list to save what's left of the triceratops.
[2:02:59.820 --> 2:03:00.820]  Okay.
[2:03:00.820 --> 2:03:03.320]  All right, thank you so much.
[2:03:03.320 --> 2:03:08.460]  We're trying to add the triceratops to the endangered species.
[2:03:08.460 --> 2:03:09.460]  So funny.
[2:03:09.460 --> 2:03:14.660]  Yeah, that triceratops, you know what, you guys are a little late, but we are a little
[2:03:14.660 --> 2:03:15.660]  late.
[2:03:15.660 --> 2:03:16.660]  Oh, hey, thank you for getting it.
[2:03:16.660 --> 2:03:18.220]  We're just pranking you, obviously.
[2:03:18.220 --> 2:03:24.340]  We're trying to save the triceratops, just need a few more signatures to help, yeah,
[2:03:24.340 --> 2:03:26.900]  just print birthday and a signature.
[2:03:26.900 --> 2:03:33.220]  A lot of people are hunting their triceratops just for sport, yeah, and adding them to the
[2:03:33.220 --> 2:03:41.740]  endangered species list will stop people from getting the licenses to hunt the triceratops.
[2:03:41.740 --> 2:03:43.140]  Thank you for supporting that.
[2:03:43.140 --> 2:03:46.340]  It's such beautiful animals, nobody should really be hunting them.
[2:03:46.340 --> 2:03:47.940]  Oh, yeah, it's not fair.
[2:03:47.940 --> 2:03:48.940]  That's right.
[2:03:48.940 --> 2:03:49.940]  Thank you so much.
[2:03:49.940 --> 2:03:50.940]  Okay.
[2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:54.940]  You know, Joe Rogan is out there hunting them, and Ted Nugent and others.
[2:03:54.940 --> 2:03:55.940]  Oh, really?
[2:03:55.940 --> 2:03:57.440]  Yeah, the trophy hunters.
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:03:59.540]  There's a really triceratops still?
[2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:01.540]  Up in parts of Africa, yeah.
[2:04:01.540 --> 2:04:02.540]  Oh, wow.
[2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:03.540]  Oh, no.
[2:04:03.540 --> 2:04:04.540]  Oh, no.
[2:04:04.540 --> 2:04:08.540]  These big game hunters are going over there, and they're trying to kill the triceratops.
[2:04:08.540 --> 2:04:09.540]  Wow.
[2:04:09.540 --> 2:04:11.540]  Just, yeah, there's only a few left.
[2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:12.540]  It's burnt.
[2:04:12.540 --> 2:04:16.420]  We're going to add them to the endangered species list so they can't, you know, get the hunting
[2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:18.420]  licenses for the triceratops.
[2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:19.420]  Okay.
[2:04:19.420 --> 2:04:20.420]  What's the date today?
[2:04:20.420 --> 2:04:24.300]  Birthday, there, to help support the cause.
[2:04:24.300 --> 2:04:25.300]  What's the date today?
[2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:27.260]  Birthday, to help support the cause.
[2:04:27.260 --> 2:04:28.260]  Birthday, right there.
[2:04:28.260 --> 2:04:33.220]  It'd be one thing if people were hunting these animals to eat, but they're hunting them just
[2:04:33.220 --> 2:04:34.220]  for sport.
[2:04:34.220 --> 2:04:37.580]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, you can't believe it, but that's all you need to see.
[2:04:37.580 --> 2:04:42.340]  The full video you can find on Mark Dice's YouTube channel, yeah, that people believe
[2:04:42.340 --> 2:04:45.140]  the triceratops still walks the planet.
[2:04:45.140 --> 2:04:50.220]  I mean, I don't know how we've gotten to this point in the idiocracy, but the great Mark
[2:04:50.220 --> 2:04:52.100]  Dice joins me on the other side.
[2:04:52.100 --> 2:04:55.100]  We'll see if he can keep a straight face when dealing with the triceratops shortage
[2:04:55.100 --> 2:04:58.100]  in this country.
[2:04:58.100 --> 2:04:59.100]  Alex Jones.
[2:04:59.100 --> 2:05:05.380]  I am taping this update on the morning of Friday, October 22nd, 2021.
[2:05:05.380 --> 2:05:10.860]  Listeners who've already tried and really seen the powerful effects of Rainforest Ultra
[2:05:10.860 --> 2:05:15.180]  should be excited to know that we've got a limited supply of it in stock, but it'll be
[2:05:15.180 --> 2:05:18.660]  sold out at current sales rates by Monday morning.
[2:05:18.660 --> 2:05:23.060]  Despite that fact, we're still offering a major discount of 25% off.
[2:05:23.060 --> 2:05:26.980]  It is an amazing, new tropic, I went to one of the top labs in the country and I said
[2:05:26.980 --> 2:05:32.980]  I want very powerful, quick acting, extremely clean, new tropic that wears off quick because
[2:05:32.980 --> 2:05:33.980]  I want to be able to take it.
[2:05:33.980 --> 2:05:38.460]  If I've got to work till 10 at night, take it at seven and for it to wear off by 10.
[2:05:38.460 --> 2:05:42.140]  And that's exactly what they did with Rainforest Ultra.
[2:05:42.140 --> 2:05:45.300]  Now we have other great products like TurboForce that last for 10 hours.
[2:05:45.300 --> 2:05:46.300]  It's a different formula.
[2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:47.300]  It's over the top powerful.
[2:05:47.300 --> 2:05:48.820]  So the stronger can't even take it.
[2:05:48.820 --> 2:05:50.180]  By the way, it's sold out right now.
[2:05:50.180 --> 2:05:55.780]  The Rainforest Ultra is really something special is 25% off limited supply will sell out early
[2:05:55.780 --> 2:06:13.220]  next week, info or store.com Yes, this is not footage from the land before time.
[2:06:13.220 --> 2:06:19.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is this is footage from the year 2021 actually where triceratops
[2:06:19.340 --> 2:06:24.900]  are roaming around in California being hunted innocent triceratops at that being hunted
[2:06:24.900 --> 2:06:26.940]  mercilessly by people like Joe Rogan.
[2:06:26.940 --> 2:06:31.300]  Of course, that's just about as absurd as anything Joe Biden says on a daily basis,
[2:06:31.300 --> 2:06:32.660]  but they believe that.
[2:06:32.660 --> 2:06:33.860]  So I guess they'll believe anything.
[2:06:33.860 --> 2:06:34.940]  Mark Dice is with us.
[2:06:34.940 --> 2:06:36.300]  You just saw his video.
[2:06:36.300 --> 2:06:41.860]  I mean, Mark, you come up with all kinds of ideas to go out for video content.
[2:06:41.860 --> 2:06:46.700]  Do you ever just think to yourself like, all right, this is the one, this is the one that
[2:06:46.700 --> 2:06:50.860]  it's just not going to take or do you think to yourself, let's see how far I can push
[2:06:50.860 --> 2:06:53.260]  it until I finally reach that point.
[2:06:53.260 --> 2:06:54.780]  I mean, were you thinking, all right.
[2:06:54.780 --> 2:06:58.460]  I'm going to, I'm going to ask people if they think we should stop hunting triceratops,
[2:06:58.460 --> 2:07:00.980]  but there's no way this is going to be the one where it doesn't take.
[2:07:00.980 --> 2:07:04.700]  I mean, what is the thought process as you get ready to shoot these videos?
[2:07:04.700 --> 2:07:08.980]  Now, I keep trying to find the limit, you know, where, where is it going to not work
[2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:10.620]  where everyone's going to get it?
[2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:12.580]  But you know, the people that are in that video, there's more.
[2:07:12.580 --> 2:07:16.940]  I left probably half the people on the cutting room floor just so the video wasn't too long
[2:07:16.940 --> 2:07:21.740]  or half the shots or so like people with their back turned to the camera as a group of people
[2:07:21.740 --> 2:07:23.620]  and you know, there's audio issues.
[2:07:23.620 --> 2:07:26.540]  You know, there's probably twice that many people that sign it.
[2:07:26.540 --> 2:07:27.740]  So it's quite shocking.
[2:07:27.740 --> 2:07:30.620]  I thought that was going to be the one where everybody would get it and I get recognized
[2:07:30.620 --> 2:07:34.260]  quite a bit by the fans when I'm doing that and one of them had his son with them who's
[2:07:34.260 --> 2:07:37.380]  probably four years old and I just asked him, I should have put him in the video.
[2:07:37.380 --> 2:07:39.860]  I said, Hey, you know, what's a triceratops dinosaur?
[2:07:39.860 --> 2:07:43.940]  He of course four year old knows what the dinosaur is, but you know, it's, it's sort
[2:07:43.940 --> 2:07:50.460]  of a Milgram experiment and almost like a quick instant hypnosis because they want to help.
[2:07:50.460 --> 2:07:54.500]  I'm an authoritative figure, I'm friendly and I just said, well, you know, I want to
[2:07:54.500 --> 2:07:55.500]  help it.
[2:07:55.500 --> 2:07:56.500]  It's, it's a strange thing.
[2:07:56.500 --> 2:07:58.700]  I can't believe that they haven't gone more viral.
[2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:03.060]  I don't think you thank you for thanks, Alex, for covering some of these.
[2:08:03.060 --> 2:08:07.300]  This is just kind of fun, idiocracy type of stuff, but you guys are one of the only news
[2:08:07.300 --> 2:08:13.580]  outlets that covered the petition to arrest the unvaccinated and to arrest the people
[2:08:13.580 --> 2:08:18.500]  who talk about President Trump winning the election or Joe Biden, the Democrats stealing
[2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:19.500]  the election.
[2:08:19.500 --> 2:08:20.900]  Nobody really covered those.
[2:08:20.900 --> 2:08:26.740]  Those were serious social experiments giving a view into the mind of these Democrats that
[2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:27.740]  walk amongst us.
[2:08:27.740 --> 2:08:31.340]  So if you haven't seen the videos and check them out on my YouTube channel, they literally
[2:08:31.340 --> 2:08:38.020]  signed a petition to arrest anybody who didn't take the vaccine and who talk about the Democrats
[2:08:38.020 --> 2:08:42.900]  stealing the election at the dinner table at happy hour, you know, under break room.
[2:08:42.900 --> 2:08:47.900]  So I'm trying to do some serious work with this with a kind of a comedic coat to try
[2:08:47.900 --> 2:08:52.420]  to wake everybody up, but it is quite stunning to see it firsthand and I don't know how to
[2:08:52.420 --> 2:08:54.580]  really fully explain it to tell you the truth.
[2:08:54.580 --> 2:09:00.580]  Well, that's the thing about it is I think it does give us kind of a view into the mind
[2:09:00.580 --> 2:09:02.740]  of these people that vote.
[2:09:02.740 --> 2:09:05.940]  I mean, I'm all about, you know, everybody has a right to vote, but then you see this
[2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:07.620]  and you're like, well, wait a second, am I?
[2:09:07.620 --> 2:09:10.860]  I mean, these people can cancel out my vote.
[2:09:10.860 --> 2:09:12.660]  Somebody that thinks a triceratops exists.
[2:09:12.660 --> 2:09:19.980]  It's not just about them being idiots or ignorant or blindly following an authoritative figure
[2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:20.980]  with a clipboard.
[2:09:20.980 --> 2:09:26.900]  I mean, these people want to arrest anybody who talks about Democrats stealing the election.
[2:09:26.900 --> 2:09:31.460]  The most fundamental right of Americans, like an American pastime, is accusing the other
[2:09:31.460 --> 2:09:33.260]  side of stealing an election.
[2:09:33.260 --> 2:09:37.700]  You know, of course, the Democrats did it after the 2000 election and, you know, I might
[2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:39.180]  actually probably agree with them.
[2:09:39.180 --> 2:09:44.180]  They're probably right, you know, and that's why I'm kind of an outcast in conservative
[2:09:44.180 --> 2:09:49.660]  circles because you're not supposed to admit any problems on your own side.
[2:09:49.660 --> 2:09:53.300]  And I mean, I'll admit that, you know, Skull and Bones, Mafia probably did steal that
[2:09:53.300 --> 2:09:54.300]  for George W. Bush.
[2:09:54.300 --> 2:09:55.860]  You're not supposed to talk about things like that.
[2:09:55.860 --> 2:10:00.740]  But I think that's why, you know, shows like yours, Info Wars is so popular because you
[2:10:00.740 --> 2:10:03.460]  don't get this kind of content anywhere else.
[2:10:03.460 --> 2:10:06.460]  Even with, you know, some of the quality stuff, I mean, Fox News does some good work.
[2:10:06.460 --> 2:10:11.300]  It's good to see OAN and Newsmax pop up, but it's still just kind of soundbite news.
[2:10:11.300 --> 2:10:16.980]  They might cover some stuff that, you know, that Fox News doesn't cover OAN and Newsmax.
[2:10:16.980 --> 2:10:22.020]  But are they doing reports on the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, or, you know, the
[2:10:22.020 --> 2:10:23.540]  transhumanist revolution?
[2:10:23.540 --> 2:10:27.660]  You're just not hearing that kind of stuff, which is why, you know, people like the long
[2:10:27.660 --> 2:10:32.700]  form in-depth deep dives from shows like Info Wars.
[2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:37.660]  Well, and, you know, you bring up Info Wars, you know, past, and you've been around doing
[2:10:37.660 --> 2:10:40.260]  your thing for a long time, too.
[2:10:40.260 --> 2:10:45.060]  I remember during the Bush years, you know, Alex Jones, I don't know if people would have
[2:10:45.060 --> 2:10:48.820]  considered him a liberal, but, you know, he was against the corruption of the Bush administration.
[2:10:48.820 --> 2:10:51.100]  He called out the Bush administration and its corruption every day.
[2:10:51.100 --> 2:10:58.220]  And I think it's not fair where the left that kind of just looked at Info Wars after Trump
[2:10:58.220 --> 2:11:03.660]  hit the scene as just like the right arm of Trump or something or just now existing because
[2:11:03.660 --> 2:11:04.660]  of Trump.
[2:11:04.660 --> 2:11:06.740]  No, it's been around a lot longer than that.
[2:11:06.740 --> 2:11:10.420]  Fighting government corruption, fighting big government, fighting tyranny has always been
[2:11:10.420 --> 2:11:13.940]  the modus operandi of Info Wars, no matter who's in the White House.
[2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:18.340]  So that was always a misconception that I thought was unfair to Alex and to Info Wars
[2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:23.060]  as a whole, just because Trump came along and it was the first president, I think, that
[2:11:23.060 --> 2:11:26.660]  we thought was the real deal and a good president here was Trump.
[2:11:26.660 --> 2:11:30.980]  So it kind of became this thing of, oh, Trump and Alex Jones and Info Wars, it's all the
[2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:31.980]  same.
[2:11:31.980 --> 2:11:34.500]  And it's like, no, that's not even close to the truth.
[2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:38.900]  But you know, I want to get back to the mindset of these people because whether they're saying
[2:11:38.900 --> 2:11:42.220]  that they want to arrest Trump supporters or saying they want to arrest somebody that
[2:11:42.220 --> 2:11:48.140]  questions the election or believing that the Triceratops exists, I mean, doesn't it just
[2:11:48.140 --> 2:11:54.380]  say where we're at as a society and as a whole, that these people just are walking around
[2:11:54.380 --> 2:12:00.540]  so ignorant, so uninformed, so brainwashed, and there's so many of them?
[2:12:00.540 --> 2:12:01.540]  It's shocking.
[2:12:01.540 --> 2:12:03.460]  I mean, my new cameraman is quite stunned.
[2:12:03.460 --> 2:12:08.100]  And one of my previous cameraman actually thought that some of the bits were fake because there
[2:12:08.100 --> 2:12:13.820]  are some of the YouTube prank channels, FusyTube, Roman Otwood, some of these people who built
[2:12:13.820 --> 2:12:17.060]  their careers literally off of doing fake pranks.
[2:12:17.060 --> 2:12:21.060]  Some of them might have been real, but it was a lot of staged stuff.
[2:12:21.060 --> 2:12:27.140]  Some of my videos have been staged, faked, no duped, 100% authentic, and to see it with
[2:12:27.140 --> 2:12:28.300]  their own eyes is quite shocking.
[2:12:28.300 --> 2:12:31.940]  And there's a lot of days where we walk away from a shoot and we just kind of shake our
[2:12:31.940 --> 2:12:32.940]  head.
[2:12:32.940 --> 2:12:37.380]  And when I do interviews with people, a lot of times they're not going to want to really
[2:12:37.380 --> 2:12:39.620]  admit how fascist they are.
[2:12:39.620 --> 2:12:43.260]  But you see, they'll sign personal information, their name, their birth date, and they'll
[2:12:43.260 --> 2:12:49.540]  sign a petition to arrest Americans for exercising one of the most basic rights in the United
[2:12:49.540 --> 2:12:51.220]  States, which is quite scary.
[2:12:51.220 --> 2:12:55.260]  I mean, this sort of stuff would have never happened five years ago before Trump.
[2:12:55.260 --> 2:13:02.140]  I mean, even with the exception of a few hardcore leftists, nobody would want to arrest the
[2:13:02.140 --> 2:13:06.460]  opposing political party for just simply saying that they think that the other team stole
[2:13:06.460 --> 2:13:07.460]  the election.
[2:13:07.460 --> 2:13:08.460]  So it's quite scary.
[2:13:08.460 --> 2:13:11.060]  It's quite a symptom of the society we're at.
[2:13:11.060 --> 2:13:14.780]  It's just a cultural degradation.
[2:13:14.780 --> 2:13:19.740]  I do have to say, though, that there are a lot of people, and I think it's probably
[2:13:19.740 --> 2:13:23.020]  perhaps more now than there has been in previous years, a lot of young people.
[2:13:23.020 --> 2:13:25.180]  I go to a college town and I do this.
[2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:29.620]  There are a lot of young people who are awake and who are conservative and who don't want
[2:13:29.620 --> 2:13:33.260]  to go along with this agenda, maybe a little bit too afraid to speak out.
[2:13:33.260 --> 2:13:37.980]  And I think because the cancel culture is affecting them, and maybe college is the first
[2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:42.940]  sort of time where most people start thinking about politics, but because the culture has
[2:13:42.940 --> 2:13:46.340]  affected these kids, they're getting in trouble.
[2:13:46.340 --> 2:13:48.180]  They're getting detention.
[2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:49.180]  They're getting grounded.
[2:13:49.180 --> 2:13:50.540]  They're getting shamed on social media.
[2:13:50.540 --> 2:13:55.620]  Some of their peers perhaps making national news just for some stupid comment that they
[2:13:55.620 --> 2:13:59.820]  said or for singing along to a rap song that one of their peers had to record and post
[2:13:59.820 --> 2:14:05.060]  on Snapchat or post it on TikTok for using the wrong kind of word and run a rap song.
[2:14:05.060 --> 2:14:09.660]  So now the culture and politics is affecting the younger generation, so I think a lot of
[2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:14.100]  them are starting to wake up and rebel against this cancel culture.
[2:14:14.100 --> 2:14:20.300]  And it's incredible to see, I'm actually shocked that Netflix hasn't banned Dave Chappelle's
[2:14:20.300 --> 2:14:21.300]  new special.
[2:14:21.300 --> 2:14:22.780]  I think they're in kind of a conundrum.
[2:14:22.780 --> 2:14:23.780]  They don't know what to do.
[2:14:23.780 --> 2:14:27.340]  I almost think that they should just to wake everybody up even more just to show how far
[2:14:27.340 --> 2:14:28.340]  it's going.
[2:14:28.340 --> 2:14:34.180]  We're in a society where they cancel Megan Kelly for saying that kids can wear a Mr.
[2:14:34.180 --> 2:14:40.620]  T costume if they're white or dress up as a Disney character, a Moana Pacific Islander
[2:14:40.620 --> 2:14:47.860]  if they're white, but they want Dave Chappelle banned for making common jokes about the society
[2:14:47.860 --> 2:14:48.860]  that we're living in.
[2:14:48.860 --> 2:14:50.260]  It's just beyond words.
[2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:52.660]  Yeah, I've got this stack of cultural news over here.
[2:14:52.660 --> 2:14:58.660]  Maybe I'll get into it with you where there's a black woman whose friends with all these
[2:14:58.660 --> 2:15:02.180]  parents at a school, I guess they're on the school board together and she's the only black
[2:15:02.180 --> 2:15:07.660]  person on the school board and they have a conversation.
[2:15:07.660 --> 2:15:11.700]  And the other woman, the white woman says something about how, oh, well, I never even
[2:15:11.700 --> 2:15:14.860]  really thought of you as black because she's kind of light skinned black person, but it's
[2:15:14.860 --> 2:15:17.260]  more just a statement of, oh, you know, I don't really care if you're black or white
[2:15:17.260 --> 2:15:18.260]  or anything.
[2:15:18.260 --> 2:15:19.260]  I don't care about your skin color.
[2:15:19.260 --> 2:15:20.260]  And she takes offense to it.
[2:15:20.260 --> 2:15:24.420]  And she's like, how dare you not think of me as black because what they've done is they've
[2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:29.140]  created a victim economy and they know that the, you know, having all these different
[2:15:29.140 --> 2:15:32.180]  victim mindsets has an economic value in the victim economy.
[2:15:32.180 --> 2:15:36.180]  So she sees I'm black, I'm rich in the victim economy.
[2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:40.340]  Don't you dare deny me of my victim economy status as a black woman.
[2:15:40.340 --> 2:15:43.500]  But I want to ask you an important question when we come back because you've been doing
[2:15:43.500 --> 2:15:44.500]  this for so long.
[2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:46.860]  And that's, it's going to be a loaded question.
[2:15:46.860 --> 2:15:47.860]  So think about it in the break.
[2:15:47.860 --> 2:15:50.740]  It's like, how did we get to this point?
[2:15:50.740 --> 2:15:54.420]  How did we get to a point where someone thinks a triceratops is real or we should arrest
[2:15:54.420 --> 2:15:56.620]  an American for free speech?
[2:15:56.620 --> 2:16:01.580]  If you're concerned about the, I'm sitting here, it's in the early morning hours and
[2:16:01.580 --> 2:16:08.340]  I'm looking at mainstream news reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving
[2:16:08.340 --> 2:16:13.940]  door FDA has come out and said that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not
[2:16:13.940 --> 2:16:19.060]  authorized for children because he in studies they did on children, it caused myocarditis
[2:16:19.060 --> 2:16:21.860]  that's heart swelling and heart attacks.
[2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:25.540]  And then I noticed that even though this is even in the associated press, it's not getting
[2:16:25.540 --> 2:16:26.780]  any circulation.
[2:16:26.780 --> 2:16:30.500]  It's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram
[2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:31.500]  or Twitter.
[2:16:31.500 --> 2:16:32.500]  It's just crazy.
[2:16:32.500 --> 2:16:37.100]  And then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from the vaccines.
[2:16:37.100 --> 2:16:38.780]  It doesn't hurt anybody.
[2:16:38.780 --> 2:16:42.380]  Your conspiracy theorists, if you say it, it's just crazy.
[2:16:42.380 --> 2:16:45.660]  And then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said, these vaccines
[2:16:45.660 --> 2:16:46.660]  are going to cause heart problems.
[2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:50.420]  They gave the exact reasons why and now it happened.
[2:16:50.420 --> 2:16:54.140]  That's why info wars is on air because if we weren't on air, they get away with even
[2:16:54.140 --> 2:16:55.340]  more of this crap.
[2:16:55.340 --> 2:16:56.340]  This is just insane.
[2:16:56.340 --> 2:16:58.060]  These people are killers.
[2:16:58.060 --> 2:17:01.440]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:05.780]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:17:05.780 --> 2:17:10.460]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[2:17:10.460 --> 2:17:14.980]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarsstore.com.
[2:17:14.980 --> 2:17:19.780]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[2:17:19.780 --> 2:17:25.540]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[2:17:25.540 --> 2:17:31.540]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:17:31.540 --> 2:17:38.180]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:17:38.180 --> 2:17:42.780]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:17:42.780 --> 2:17:48.540]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:51.340]  facts that pertain to reality.
[2:17:51.340 --> 2:18:20.180]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com.
[2:18:20.180 --> 2:18:38.460]  This is a criminal takeover and when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians,
[2:18:38.460 --> 2:18:43.140]  it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of congress,
[2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:47.300]  it's their staff, and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers
[2:18:47.300 --> 2:18:53.140]  who are all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else
[2:18:53.140 --> 2:18:54.780]  through corporate rule.
[2:18:54.780 --> 2:18:57.300]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[2:18:57.300 --> 2:19:02.900]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[2:19:02.900 --> 2:19:05.300]  the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[2:19:05.300 --> 2:19:08.780]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your
[2:19:08.780 --> 2:19:14.500]  house and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their
[2:19:14.500 --> 2:19:19.700]  facilities, and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where
[2:19:19.700 --> 2:19:23.540]  they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their
[2:19:23.540 --> 2:19:24.540]  safety.
[2:19:24.540 --> 2:19:27.940]  This is nothing less than martial law, and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[2:19:27.940 --> 2:19:32.300]  to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very
[2:19:32.300 --> 2:19:37.220]  compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarsstore.com.

[2:20:01.380 --> 2:20:20.780]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:20.780 --> 2:20:26.860]  Mark Dice is with us, one of the best channels you're going to find on YouTube, and I'm
[2:20:26.860 --> 2:20:32.100]  asking him maybe the toughest question, and that's how did we get here?
[2:20:32.100 --> 2:20:35.860]  How did we get to a point, Mark, where you can go out on the streets of America and you
[2:20:35.860 --> 2:20:41.220]  have people that actually believe triceratops are walking amongst us, or they'll call for
[2:20:41.220 --> 2:20:44.900]  the arrest of people for their free speech, this is just two of the subjects that you've
[2:20:44.900 --> 2:20:49.420]  covered in your long line of videos that you have on your YouTube channel, the Mark Dice
[2:20:49.420 --> 2:20:54.820]  channel, but what would be your best analysis of how did we get to this point of living
[2:20:54.820 --> 2:20:57.500]  the reality of the movie Idiocracy?
[2:20:57.500 --> 2:21:02.580]  Yeah, I think people have become accustomed to doing what they're told, not thinking,
[2:21:02.580 --> 2:21:06.660]  being afraid to think, being afraid to resist, and I think my videos, particularly with the
[2:21:06.660 --> 2:21:09.420]  petitions, demonstrate a modern day Milgram experiment.
[2:21:09.420 --> 2:21:14.380]  I'm an authority figure, I'm asking for their help, people want to help, and I think their
[2:21:14.380 --> 2:21:21.340]  critical thinking skills just shut off, and they just kind of hear a general version of
[2:21:21.340 --> 2:21:26.060]  the message that I'm saying, oh, animal, I like animals, oh man, they don't like Joe
[2:21:26.060 --> 2:21:33.540]  Rogan, so I think I'm tapping into the basic instincts of the human subconscious, and so
[2:21:33.540 --> 2:21:37.380]  that's why I keep repeating myself three or four times to make it clear that they didn't
[2:21:37.380 --> 2:21:41.780]  hear me triceratops the first time, I mean, I'm doing it three or four times to really
[2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:45.460]  hammer the point that it's just going over their head, and I think once they're focusing
[2:21:45.460 --> 2:21:50.940]  on something, their brain just completely shuts off and they're on autopilot, but that's
[2:21:50.940 --> 2:21:53.300]  one aspect of the problem.
[2:21:53.300 --> 2:21:58.820]  Another aspect is that when they are thinking, they are fascists and want to arrest people
[2:21:58.820 --> 2:22:02.380]  for doubting the outcome of the 2020 election.
[2:22:02.380 --> 2:22:07.420]  It's quite disturbing, and you can see it time and time again, I just make the most outrageous
[2:22:07.420 --> 2:22:14.580]  statements and they keep on agreeing, and that's why I try to do with these videos is
[2:22:14.580 --> 2:22:18.860]  to really give a face to these people that we see on Twitter.
[2:22:18.860 --> 2:22:22.500]  You know, Twitter's, I call it the engine that's driving the crazy train of society.
[2:22:22.500 --> 2:22:25.540]  It seems to be the breeding ground of all of this insanity.
[2:22:25.540 --> 2:22:30.060]  Everything crazy starts on Twitter, it seems, and then they curate the topic into a trending
[2:22:30.060 --> 2:22:34.220]  topic to try to give the false appearance as if it's actually popular, and then people
[2:22:34.220 --> 2:22:39.700]  start commenting about it, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that then makes it a top story, and
[2:22:39.700 --> 2:22:44.220]  then it becomes percolated in the mainstream media, just like International Pronouns Day,
[2:22:44.220 --> 2:22:46.540]  Happy Belated Preferred Pronouns Day, by the way.
[2:22:46.540 --> 2:22:49.820]  Well, we celebrated big over here, don't worry.
[2:22:49.820 --> 2:22:52.820]  Something that would have been considered a joke that, you know, you can't tell what
[2:22:52.820 --> 2:22:55.940]  do they call it, post-law, you can't tell whether something is a joke or satire, it's
[2:22:55.940 --> 2:22:56.940]  things have gotten that crazy.
[2:22:56.940 --> 2:22:59.980]  You know, somebody told you this a couple years ago, hey, it's International Pronouns
[2:22:59.980 --> 2:23:04.540]  Day and the State Department is going to, you know, put out a tweet about it, and here
[2:23:04.540 --> 2:23:09.900]  in San Diego, our San Diego County Supervisor, Nathan Fletcher, put out a video demonstrating
[2:23:09.900 --> 2:23:16.220]  that bragging that they, all the county employees have their preferred pronouns in their email
[2:23:16.220 --> 2:23:22.100]  pictures, and in their bio, now, on their, on the county's website, and I think too,
[2:23:22.100 --> 2:23:25.780]  because people were afraid, the Republicans were afraid, especially to push back with
[2:23:25.780 --> 2:23:31.140]  the cultural degradation, you know, a lot of these people, oh, socialism's bad, socialism's
[2:23:31.140 --> 2:23:36.100]  bad, all the turning point USA, it seems to be preaching against socialism, and they were
[2:23:36.100 --> 2:23:41.900]  afraid to touch the cultural issues, and so it started maybe five or six years ago, remember
[2:23:41.900 --> 2:23:46.740]  when the Halloween costumes caused the students to cry, I think it was Yale or Harvard, and
[2:23:46.740 --> 2:23:50.980]  they surrounded one of the, one of the, one of the teachers or one of the administrators
[2:23:50.980 --> 2:23:54.420]  and started screaming about how they were going to allow Halloween costumes.
[2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:57.380]  Yeah, now they, now they banned Halloween, you can't even do it anymore.
[2:23:57.380 --> 2:24:02.660]  Yeah, it's offensive, apparently, you know, and I made the joke that, you know, so I guess
[2:24:02.660 --> 2:24:06.180]  I never thought that, you know, students of color didn't celebrate Halloween, but that
[2:24:06.180 --> 2:24:10.020]  was the justification for that elementary school, as I just said, hey, if you can't
[2:24:10.020 --> 2:24:14.660]  afford a costume, just put on some gloves, grab a fake plastic knife if you're a black
[2:24:14.660 --> 2:24:18.820]  student, and go as O.J. Simpson.
[2:24:18.820 --> 2:24:23.460]  Oh boy, that, oh, that, you can't say that these days, you're not allowed to say anything,
[2:24:23.460 --> 2:24:30.340]  but see, that, that hits on a different, on a different note because it just shows you
[2:24:30.340 --> 2:24:34.700]  how, again, five, 10 years ago, this would all be foreign, this, none of this would
[2:24:34.700 --> 2:24:37.820]  even exist, you don't think about this, you don't hear about this, I mean, this is all
[2:24:37.820 --> 2:24:43.140]  new, but it's amazing how it's, it's so new, but yet it's so entrenched at the same time
[2:24:43.140 --> 2:24:46.180]  as if it's been here forever, but it really just came up overnight.
[2:24:46.180 --> 2:24:50.620]  Well, and we've seen this on Twitter, those of us in the media who've been plugged in,
[2:24:50.620 --> 2:24:56.540]  the viewers of your show, have seen this percolating and growing and festering online, and we tried
[2:24:56.540 --> 2:25:00.180]  to warn about it, we slowly tried to mock it, we laughed at it a few years ago, but now,
[2:25:00.180 --> 2:25:03.460]  I mean, as you know, I mean, I got, I got a personal friend of mine who called me and
[2:25:03.460 --> 2:25:06.900]  he says, oh, I started a new job and I had to go through three days of training and they're
[2:25:06.900 --> 2:25:11.900]  teaching me about pronouns and, you know, the critical race there and now it's, it's
[2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:14.180]  being indoctrinated into the employees.
[2:25:14.180 --> 2:25:19.500]  So it all starts on Twitter, the crazy train, driving society.
[2:25:19.500 --> 2:25:23.100]  And now I don't know if you've seen these, have you seen the PSAs that Facebook is actually
[2:25:23.100 --> 2:25:29.100]  putting out demanding, begging that Section 230 get amended, have you seen these, they're
[2:25:29.100 --> 2:25:34.460]  literally putting out PSAs of a content moderator and he's being interviewed by a fake interviewer
[2:25:34.460 --> 2:25:38.660]  and he's like, yeah, we got a really tough job, you know, I don't think it's Facebook's
[2:25:38.660 --> 2:25:41.860]  job to determine what people should and should say online.
[2:25:41.860 --> 2:25:46.500]  So we're hoping that the government amend Section 230 to give us guidance.
[2:25:46.500 --> 2:25:51.700]  The reason for that, of course, is because then all social media platforms, they're hoping
[2:25:51.700 --> 2:25:58.180]  will ban discussions about certain topics, ban certain individuals and won't allow certain
[2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:03.300]  memes to be going viral or to be posted because then Facebook will stop hemorrhaging users
[2:26:03.300 --> 2:26:08.340]  if everyone's tired of the censorship and the, you know, formalion algorithms over there.
[2:26:08.340 --> 2:26:11.860]  You just go over to Gab, go to Telegram, you know, these alternative sites, Trump snooze,
[2:26:11.860 --> 2:26:13.980]  you know, Truth Social popping up here soon.
[2:26:13.980 --> 2:26:18.700]  So they want Section 230 amended the exact opposite of what we wanted, we wanted it so
[2:26:18.700 --> 2:26:22.680]  that it would be actually fair and that if it wasn't violating the law that whatever
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:27.900]  somebody posted would be allowed to stand, but they're trying to get it so that nobody
[2:26:27.900 --> 2:26:33.140]  on any social media service is allowed to post certain things and that way Facebook
[2:26:33.140 --> 2:26:38.340]  can prevent, in their hopes, people from leaving and going to these alternative platforms where
[2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:42.580]  you're allowed to post memes without getting fact-checked.
[2:26:42.580 --> 2:26:46.340]  Facebook is fact-checking memes about gas prices now, okay?
[2:26:46.340 --> 2:26:48.660]  So first they said it's just election integrity.
[2:26:48.660 --> 2:26:52.020]  Oh, it's just, we're just don't want election misinformation.
[2:26:52.020 --> 2:26:55.180]  Then it's, we don't want medical misinformation.
[2:26:55.180 --> 2:26:58.860]  They literally censor and fact-check memes about the price of gas.
[2:26:58.860 --> 2:27:02.920]  If you just say, hey, gas prices haven't been this high since the last Democrat is in office,
[2:27:02.920 --> 2:27:07.860]  they will black it out, they will put a fact check, they will say that it's false, a meme
[2:27:07.860 --> 2:27:09.380]  about gas prices.
[2:27:09.380 --> 2:27:11.540]  That's where we're at on the big tech social media.
[2:27:11.540 --> 2:27:14.540]  That's why everybody's tired of them and going to these alternative platforms which they're
[2:27:14.540 --> 2:27:15.540]  trying to shut down.
[2:27:15.540 --> 2:27:18.900]  And you know, they see, and it seems like this other tactic that they do too, it's kind
[2:27:18.900 --> 2:27:22.460]  of what they do with the vaccine mandates where the, like Biden says, oh, I have a vaccine
[2:27:22.460 --> 2:27:24.620]  mandate, but he actually doesn't.
[2:27:24.620 --> 2:27:29.820]  And then it becomes a corporate vaccine mandate, but then they actually blame the, the Biden
[2:27:29.820 --> 2:27:33.100]  administration, hey, they did this, it's not our fault, but then the Biden administration
[2:27:33.100 --> 2:27:34.660]  says, oh, well, no, it's just the court.
[2:27:34.660 --> 2:27:37.060]  So it's kind of this weird, like, bait and switch they do.
[2:27:37.060 --> 2:27:39.220]  It's like, who really mandated the vaccines?
[2:27:39.220 --> 2:27:42.140]  Oh, wait, they're actually not mandated, but they are.
[2:27:42.140 --> 2:27:44.260]  And so it's the same thing with censorship.
[2:27:44.260 --> 2:27:47.900]  It's like, oh, well, we like section 230, but we really don't.
[2:27:47.900 --> 2:27:50.180]  We want to censor everybody, but we really don't.
[2:27:50.180 --> 2:27:51.740]  It's the government censoring you.
[2:27:51.740 --> 2:27:52.740]  It's not us.
[2:27:52.740 --> 2:27:56.300]  So it's just, it's this weird game that they play, like a bait and switch thing where they
[2:27:56.300 --> 2:28:01.620]  kind of prop up the other person to blame, but then they also kind of fall back on, on
[2:28:01.620 --> 2:28:04.340]  doing it themselves at the end of the day.
[2:28:04.340 --> 2:28:08.700]  Of course, this all changed immediately after Trump won in 2016.
[2:28:08.700 --> 2:28:12.580]  You know, those are the good old days of social media where what you posted would show up
[2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:16.700]  in your friends feed when you could actually search YouTube for specific topics and find
[2:28:16.700 --> 2:28:17.700]  videos.
[2:28:17.700 --> 2:28:20.340]  It's like when you opened your mouth and spoke, something came out.
[2:28:20.340 --> 2:28:25.380]  Now it's just like.
[2:28:25.380 --> 2:28:31.180]  You know, I remember the days on early YouTube when my videos were literally the only videos
[2:28:31.180 --> 2:28:33.140]  that would show up in the search results.
[2:28:33.140 --> 2:28:35.020]  That's how long I've been on YouTube.
[2:28:35.020 --> 2:28:39.980]  And of course, you know, the younger generations are going to grow up and not know that when
[2:28:39.980 --> 2:28:43.740]  you're used to search for something, you would find relevant videos, not just mainstream
[2:28:43.740 --> 2:28:44.740]  media and everything.
[2:28:44.740 --> 2:28:48.580]  I mean, even if you search like Brian Stelter parody, I think all the top search results
[2:28:48.580 --> 2:28:53.260]  are CNN's videos because that's a whole other topic about how different the internet is
[2:28:53.260 --> 2:28:54.260]  now.
[2:28:54.260 --> 2:28:56.660]  If Mark dies with us, we'll be right back.
[2:28:56.660 --> 2:28:57.980]  If you're concerned about the power.
[2:28:57.980 --> 2:29:04.060]  One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation.
[2:29:04.060 --> 2:29:05.420]  It's associated with cancer.
[2:29:05.420 --> 2:29:10.220]  It's associated with joint problems associated with viral infections, bacterial infections.
[2:29:10.220 --> 2:29:14.340]  It's associated with death and out of all the incredible compounds that God gave us
[2:29:14.340 --> 2:29:18.580]  through nature that fights inflammation and makes our lives better.
[2:29:18.580 --> 2:29:24.380]  Tumeric is chief amongst all and chief amongst all the turmeric products out there is body's
[2:29:24.380 --> 2:29:25.900]  ultimate turmeric formula.
[2:29:25.900 --> 2:29:27.060]  My wife loves turmeric.
[2:29:27.060 --> 2:29:30.460]  She has joint pain, but just take a lot of it, the type of stuff she buys at the grocery
[2:29:30.460 --> 2:29:31.980]  store for it to work.
[2:29:31.980 --> 2:29:35.020]  She started taking this and said, I only need to take one pill instead of four.
[2:29:35.020 --> 2:29:36.260]  Why is it so good?
[2:29:36.260 --> 2:29:37.540]  It's not just turmeric.
[2:29:37.540 --> 2:29:40.620]  It's concentrated with the proprietary process.

[2:30:58.180 --> 2:31:07.140]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[2:31:07.140 --> 2:31:12.220]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[2:31:12.220 --> 2:31:13.220]  in place.
[2:31:13.220 --> 2:31:18.780]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[2:31:18.780 --> 2:31:23.860]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased
[2:31:23.860 --> 2:31:26.980]  criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[2:31:26.980 --> 2:31:35.260]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[2:31:35.260 --> 2:31:39.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[2:31:39.700 --> 2:31:44.380]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us, cloud swab and the human admit they're
[2:31:44.380 --> 2:31:48.500]  coming out with implantable microchips as part of the world ID and carbon taxes.
[2:31:48.500 --> 2:31:51.580]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[2:31:51.580 --> 2:31:57.540]  They only get better if we resist and say no, non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[2:31:57.540 --> 2:32:02.580]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[2:32:02.580 --> 2:32:06.180]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:32:06.180 --> 2:32:10.420]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it
[2:32:10.420 --> 2:32:15.580]  has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric
[2:32:15.580 --> 2:32:16.580]  effects.
[2:32:16.580 --> 2:32:22.220]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[2:32:22.220 --> 2:32:26.500]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:32:26.500 --> 2:32:31.220]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[2:32:31.220 --> 2:32:32.500]  loosen up a little.
[2:32:32.500 --> 2:32:36.980]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:32:36.980 --> 2:32:43.340]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[2:32:43.340 --> 2:32:50.060]  herbs including but not limited to German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap and Valerian root.

[2:33:00.900 --> 2:33:21.900]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:33:21.900 --> 2:33:22.900]  Mark Dice is our guest.
[2:33:22.900 --> 2:33:26.900]  I got a couple other questions from Mark and then I've got some cultural news I may
[2:33:26.900 --> 2:33:33.860]  get into with Mark as well, and we were just getting into the thing about the internet,
[2:33:33.860 --> 2:33:36.740]  but I actually want to take it back to something you were breaking down at the beginning of
[2:33:36.740 --> 2:33:44.140]  the last segment, Mark, and I think what has happened when you interview these people in
[2:33:44.140 --> 2:33:49.700]  there just so clueless, I would say is the best way to put it, is that we've had it so
[2:33:49.700 --> 2:33:54.660]  good for so long here in America that these people basically can just walk around as clueless
[2:33:54.660 --> 2:33:59.540]  zombies with no survival instincts, critical thinking at all because it's just so good
[2:33:59.540 --> 2:34:02.500]  and they can live and they can thrive and they can survive and they can have a roof
[2:34:02.500 --> 2:34:07.380]  over their heads and they can have easy access to food and energy, so there's no consequences
[2:34:07.380 --> 2:34:08.940]  for being a complete idiot.
[2:34:08.940 --> 2:34:13.020]  There's no consequences for having no survival instincts or anything whatsoever, you're just
[2:34:13.020 --> 2:34:19.140]  totally controlled by the elements around you, whatever way they go, so I feel like there's
[2:34:19.140 --> 2:34:24.140]  a certain element of we've just had it so good in this country that people have basically
[2:34:24.140 --> 2:34:28.500]  just turned off all critical thinking, all survival instincts, and just kind of float
[2:34:28.500 --> 2:34:30.540]  around like dust in the wind.
[2:34:30.540 --> 2:34:35.660]  It is a muscle that atrophies from lack of use and especially with the internet, I think
[2:34:35.660 --> 2:34:40.100]  there have been studies that show that it's diminishing people's long term memory because
[2:34:40.100 --> 2:34:43.900]  if you're going to remember something long term, it's almost like if you know something
[2:34:43.900 --> 2:34:47.900]  is important, your mind is going to store it in long term memory at the end of the day,
[2:34:47.900 --> 2:34:52.580]  it's going to do a data dump, put it into the long term memory, so if it's not important
[2:34:52.580 --> 2:34:57.460]  short term memory, it just sort of evaporates out at the end of the day, or maybe within
[2:34:57.460 --> 2:35:02.260]  a few minutes or within a few hours, and so I think it probably is a good analogy that
[2:35:02.260 --> 2:35:08.100]  the mind is a muscle, that they're not using it, that it's getting weak, that people are
[2:35:08.100 --> 2:35:13.620]  becoming ping pong balls and they're just so easily manipulated, and with CNN and liberal
[2:35:13.620 --> 2:35:19.860]  media demonizing Trump supporters for now almost five years, constantly just painting
[2:35:19.860 --> 2:35:26.020]  every one of them as Nazis and evil, that's why these people have started to believe it,
[2:35:26.020 --> 2:35:30.700]  the gaslighting, and so what would you want to do with some terrorist that's walking
[2:35:30.700 --> 2:35:31.700]  amongst you?
[2:35:31.700 --> 2:35:34.600]  Well, you wouldn't throw them in jail, of course, you wouldn't want al-Qaeda members
[2:35:34.600 --> 2:35:38.620]  walking around in your neighborhood amongst you, you wouldn't want to round them up, and
[2:35:38.620 --> 2:35:43.460]  so that's what they believe many of the Trump supporters are, and that's why CNN is in the
[2:35:43.460 --> 2:35:49.220]  entire liberal media industrial complex is so desperate to continue to paint them as
[2:35:49.220 --> 2:35:54.300]  the enemy and Trump is the enemy because hardly any Republicans denounce Trump after, you
[2:35:54.300 --> 2:35:59.140]  know, the January 6th mostly peaceful protest, and I don't know, hopefully you don't waste
[2:35:59.140 --> 2:36:02.940]  any of your time or brain cells doing it, but I'll tune in to CNN fairly on a regular
[2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:08.260]  basis, I watch CNN so that you don't have to, I'm not kidding you, they lead with January
[2:36:08.260 --> 2:36:15.340]  6th several nights a week, every show, every day talks about it, and Don Lemon pounded
[2:36:15.340 --> 2:36:19.460]  on the desk the other day, because people were starting to get tired of him here after
[2:36:19.460 --> 2:36:24.940]  almost 10 months of them literally, I'm serious, this is like prime time television and you
[2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:30.180]  would think that Anderson Cooper, Don Lemonhead, Krip Fredo is going to start with, hey, look
[2:36:30.180 --> 2:36:33.980]  at this, the ports are backed up, grocery shelves are empty, inflation is out of control,
[2:36:33.980 --> 2:36:34.980]  gas prices are all done like-
[2:36:34.980 --> 2:36:35.980]  You mean like news?
[2:36:35.980 --> 2:36:36.980]  Yeah, actual news.
[2:36:36.980 --> 2:36:37.980]  Oh.
[2:36:37.980 --> 2:36:42.500]  They're literally starting, we have new footage of the January 6th insurrection, and all
[2:36:42.500 --> 2:36:46.900]  they do is just complain about Trump, I don't know how people continue to actually watch
[2:36:46.900 --> 2:36:48.220]  it, but then again-
[2:36:48.220 --> 2:36:49.220]  They don't.
[2:36:49.220 --> 2:36:52.980]  Jerry Springer, Jerry Springer was on air for I think almost 25 years, you know, every
[2:36:52.980 --> 2:36:58.460]  day, Jerry Springer and Maury Povich, because you would think they'd be like a novelty after,
[2:36:58.460 --> 2:37:02.860]  I don't know, a week or two weeks, but literally, Maury Povich was on air for almost 25 years
[2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:09.460]  every day, you are the father, you know, so I guess there's just so many morons out there.
[2:37:09.460 --> 2:37:14.660]  Well, I think the difference is though that CNN is basically a weapon against America,
[2:37:14.660 --> 2:37:20.580]  so it's got to stay in operating procedures, but you know, and I watch or I monitor the
[2:37:20.580 --> 2:37:27.140]  fake news as well for the same reason as you do, you're a media commentator, and the one
[2:37:27.140 --> 2:37:31.780]  thing I have noticed though is that they have their two big fake news stories, January 6th
[2:37:31.780 --> 2:37:35.180]  is usually the lead, but now they're bringing back the fake Russiagate thing too, that's
[2:37:35.180 --> 2:37:38.660]  kind of, they're peppering that back in too, their big two fake news stories, they just
[2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:42.180]  keep going back and forth with it, they can't move on, it's like they're stuck in a time
[2:37:42.180 --> 2:37:47.180]  loop, but let's move on to something else here, you mentioned this in the last segment
[2:37:47.180 --> 2:37:51.140]  and I was talking about this yesterday, how different the internet is now than it was
[2:37:51.140 --> 2:37:55.540]  say five or really even ten years ago more than anything, it used to be the wild west
[2:37:55.540 --> 2:38:01.460]  of information and just any sort of digital consumption, now it's so controlled, it takes
[2:38:01.460 --> 2:38:06.220]  such an effort to find what you're looking for, half the stuff gets memory-hold, you've
[2:38:06.220 --> 2:38:10.260]  been on the internet for a long time, you could say you're an expert on the internet,
[2:38:10.260 --> 2:38:13.060]  I would even say, I would say the same about myself, even since I was a kid I loved the
[2:38:13.060 --> 2:38:16.180]  internet, talk about how different it is now.
[2:38:16.180 --> 2:38:21.300]  Well, in the early days of YouTube, and even up until after Trump was elected when everything
[2:38:21.300 --> 2:38:26.220]  changed, when all of the bogus fact checks, all the censorship started to try to contain
[2:38:26.220 --> 2:38:31.540]  the conversation, because we used these new tools to bypass the mainstream media, and
[2:38:31.540 --> 2:38:38.660]  then the empire struck back, working with big tech to then merge big tech with the traditional
[2:38:38.660 --> 2:38:43.620]  mainstream media, so up until just four or five years ago, when you search for things
[2:38:43.620 --> 2:38:49.260]  on YouTube, you would find the most relevant video, not the video with the most views,
[2:38:49.260 --> 2:38:52.340]  but they actually had a pretty good algorithm, it would be the videos with the most watch
[2:38:52.340 --> 2:38:57.180]  time, so if somebody watched a video for five minutes on average, it's a good search result,
[2:38:57.180 --> 2:39:01.740]  it's a good video, somebody clicked on a video, watched it for five seconds and clicked off,
[2:39:01.740 --> 2:39:05.500]  it wasn't what they were looking for, so it would be buried lower in the search results,
[2:39:05.500 --> 2:39:10.380]  and for those of them watching this, we kind of know this, but we maybe need to keep reminding
[2:39:10.380 --> 2:39:15.300]  people of these recent history of these changes, because for example, when you would search
[2:39:15.300 --> 2:39:20.260]  for the Federal Reserve, the private mafia bank that's running the central banking system
[2:39:20.260 --> 2:39:25.660]  and destroying our currency, you would find relevant videos and documentaries and commentary
[2:39:25.660 --> 2:39:30.380]  about the Federal Reserve, but then when Chris Hayes from MSNBC complained about the search
[2:39:30.380 --> 2:39:37.260]  results for the Federal Reserve, then YouTube went and added tags, added that search result
[2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:43.260]  to the tag of manipulated results to then boost the channels that they've tagged internally
[2:39:43.260 --> 2:39:51.980]  as authoritative sources, and so now whatever you search for when it comes to news or politics,
[2:39:51.980 --> 2:39:55.820]  the top search results are almost always from mainstream channels.
[2:39:55.820 --> 2:40:01.300]  It never used to be that way, because it was YouTube, it was the alternative to the mainstream,
[2:40:01.300 --> 2:40:07.100]  and then they've combined and sort of formed an alliance, which is why then Facebook was
[2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:16.180]  paying CNN to have Anderson Cooper do a special show just for Facebook, it's why all the material
[2:40:16.180 --> 2:40:20.860]  that are in your feeds are only mainstream media, they'll allow you to share a video
[2:40:20.860 --> 2:40:29.620]  on Facebook, and we have the analytics on the pages to see the drop in reach, but if
[2:40:29.620 --> 2:40:34.780]  I post one of my videos on Facebook today, they're uploaded, nobody watches it, hardly
[2:40:34.780 --> 2:40:40.460]  anybody watches it, pre-algorithm manipulation, I mean you'd have 10 million people would
[2:40:40.460 --> 2:40:42.460]  watch the man on the street interviews.
[2:40:42.460 --> 2:40:48.020]  I remember, I'd get on YouTube years ago and your videos would almost always be trending
[2:40:48.020 --> 2:40:51.860]  because it was just a real organic algorithm, and it was like, hey, everybody's watching
[2:40:51.860 --> 2:40:56.260]  the Mark Dice videos and so it would go to the top trending videos, now you probably,
[2:40:56.260 --> 2:40:57.540]  you'll probably never see that again.
[2:40:57.540 --> 2:41:02.180]  Actually, let me go back even further, remember the good old days of Google video even before
[2:41:02.180 --> 2:41:05.660]  YouTube, or perhaps even before YouTube came out of everybody's radar and they had the
[2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:12.300]  top 100 trending list, and it was videos like Alex Jones's Terror Storm documentary and
[2:41:12.300 --> 2:41:22.300]  Loose Change, and it was a resource of documentary films that people were producing, that people
[2:41:22.300 --> 2:41:26.060]  were sharing organically, this was even really before social media, so people were, you know,
[2:41:26.060 --> 2:41:30.420]  remember the old days of emailing, you know, sending off your email list, or people sharing
[2:41:30.420 --> 2:41:35.460]  them in forums, and you know, I have a friend who runs a forum, and there are still our
[2:41:35.460 --> 2:41:40.300]  forums as you know, like Reddit and different automotive forums and things that use the
[2:41:40.300 --> 2:41:45.500]  old fashion forum software, which you can buy, you can, you know, just license that,
[2:41:45.500 --> 2:41:50.420]  so he has a forum, and he runs, I'm not going to say which industry he's in, and he told
[2:41:50.420 --> 2:41:59.020]  me that there is a disgruntled feature, so that if somebody is trolling, or if he wants
[2:41:59.020 --> 2:42:04.500]  to discourage, it's a discourage feature rather, you can actually add a discourage
[2:42:04.500 --> 2:42:08.940]  filter onto somebody's account, and then when they log in, it just won't log in, it'll
[2:42:08.940 --> 2:42:17.180]  take three attempts, or the forum won't load, and yeah, I'm not kidding you, and he said
[2:42:17.180 --> 2:42:22.260]  that you could do this, and he doesn't follow social media, he doesn't follow a lot of the
[2:42:22.260 --> 2:42:25.060]  censorship stuff, but we were just, you know, we hadn't seen each other for a while, we're
[2:42:25.060 --> 2:42:29.740]  talking about, hey, how about you put up two, and I couldn't believe it, I mean, I can,
[2:42:29.740 --> 2:42:30.740]  but it just makes perfect sense.
[2:42:30.740 --> 2:42:33.780]  I was going to say, that explains a lot.
[2:42:33.780 --> 2:42:39.420]  It's a feature, not a bug, okay, and I'm being 100% serious, so if that's a feature built
[2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:48.860]  into a commercially available forum software that people are using for various industries,
[2:42:48.860 --> 2:42:53.500]  imagine what these big social media services have, we don't have to directly censor you,
[2:42:53.500 --> 2:42:56.660]  we'll just torment you until you go away.
[2:42:56.660 --> 2:43:23.340]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[2:43:23.340 --> 2:43:39.100]  I'll be
[2:43:39.100 --> 2:43:44.860]  We're not doing that. This is the highest rated. It's 40% off. The sale ends on Monday.

[2:44:01.500 --> 2:44:04.860]  Jacob in Ohio. Welcome. Go ahead. Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:44:04.860 --> 2:44:09.580]  Good, bro. Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[2:44:09.580 --> 2:44:13.420]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting,
[2:44:13.420 --> 2:44:17.260]  moralization, and absurdity. It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[2:44:17.260 --> 2:44:20.380]  All right. Eric in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[2:44:20.380 --> 2:44:23.260]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick
[2:44:23.260 --> 2:44:27.820]  plug out for one of the products. The X2 does wonders. I recommend it to everybody.
[2:44:27.820 --> 2:44:31.900]  You're on the fence about it. Get off the fence. Get the product. Support the M4.
[2:44:31.900 --> 2:44:34.700]  Tyler in Maine. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:37.100]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[2:44:37.100 --> 2:44:38.300]  Honored talk to you. Awesome.
[2:44:39.100 --> 2:44:44.700]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:50.300]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So, just number one for a few of you.
[2:44:50.300 --> 2:44:53.340]  I like that one. It's just not a joke. Absolutely.
[2:44:58.300 --> 2:45:02.700]  By now, you've heard me talk about the Bio Pros and how they're creating amazing products.
[2:45:02.700 --> 2:45:08.380]  They've done it again and have just released an entire suite of bioremediation products,
[2:45:08.380 --> 2:45:11.580]  bringing industrial-level technology to the everyday consumer.
[2:45:11.580 --> 2:45:15.980]  They're literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system.
[2:45:15.980 --> 2:45:22.780]  The Bio Pros are excited to release Bio Marine Pro, a product specifically designed to create
[2:45:22.780 --> 2:45:29.740]  healthy black and or gray water holding tanks. Bio Marine Pro digests grease, fats, oil, sludge,

[2:45:47.660 --> 2:45:55.340]  holding tank problems, gas buildup, and odor guarantee. Visit theBioPros.com and see for yourself.
[2:45:55.340 --> 2:46:03.020]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between
[2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:08.140]  free individuals and nation-states on one side and the globalist on the other,
[2:46:08.140 --> 2:46:13.340]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world. From the United States to Brazil and,
[2:46:13.340 --> 2:46:17.420]  of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private,
[2:46:17.420 --> 2:46:21.980]  corporate, and fascist world government. That's why they launched their great resets.
[2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:28.780]  And they're programing for collapsing us of Build Back Better. This is nothing more than a top-down
[2:46:29.340 --> 2:46:34.380]  vertical consolidation of the world economy. And because they couldn't take our guns and because
[2:46:34.380 --> 2:46:39.420]  we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't
[2:46:39.420 --> 2:46:46.540]  win. They released a biological weapon on us. Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about
[2:46:46.540 --> 2:46:51.020]  20 months ago. It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[2:46:51.020 --> 2:46:55.740]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19, and you know the rest of the history.
[2:46:55.740 --> 2:46:57.340]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:46:57.340 --> 2:47:03.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:19.100 --> 2:47:23.740]  Final segment here with Mark Dice. Remember folks, infowarstore.com, that's how everything we do

[2:47:59.100 --> 2:48:04.540]  is the solution. It's 50% off at infowarstore.com. But take advantage of that before it sells out.

[2:48:10.140 --> 2:48:14.940]  great guests like Mark Dice. All right, Mark, let's get into some cultural news here. But first,
[2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:18.620]  let me ask you a difficult question. I know it's been asked before. It's not my original thought
[2:48:18.620 --> 2:48:23.340]  here. But maybe you can figure this out for me, Mark. Because, you know, Blackface is bad. We've
[2:48:23.340 --> 2:48:27.260]  been told Blackface is bad. Unless a Democrat or a liberal does it, then it's okay. We forgive
[2:48:27.260 --> 2:48:35.740]  and forget. But tell me, what is the difference between a transsexual or a drag queen and Blackface?
[2:48:35.740 --> 2:48:41.420]  What is the difference? I'm having a hard time following all of this madness. And I tell you
[2:48:41.420 --> 2:48:48.060]  at times, I mean, I do wish that I was like doing a cooking channel. There's getting so maddening,
[2:48:48.060 --> 2:48:53.340]  like you can't wrap your mind around it. And I'll say this about the Dave Chappelle thing. They
[2:48:53.340 --> 2:48:57.980]  keep on complaining about it. I don't think they're there in their third week now of wanting to ban
[2:48:57.980 --> 2:49:04.060]  that show. But Netflix doesn't have a problem. There's a show on there called AJ and the Drag Queen.
[2:49:04.060 --> 2:49:09.580]  And I watch CNN, so you don't have to. But I'm not going to watch any of these shows. Thankfully,
[2:49:09.580 --> 2:49:14.780]  Newsbusters did an episode or did an article about this where it's a drag queen, it's RuPaul,
[2:49:14.780 --> 2:49:21.020]  and he's going around the country with a 10-year-old boy doing drag shows. And RuPaul's bringing this
[2:49:21.020 --> 2:49:25.900]  poor child behind the scenes into the drag shows. And you can go look at this article. I'll show
[2:49:25.900 --> 2:49:31.100]  you guys probably cover this at the time. The degenerate drag queens are making sexual references
[2:49:31.100 --> 2:49:37.500]  about the 10-year-old boy. And Netflix is okay with that. So not only did they do that and on
[2:49:37.500 --> 2:49:43.660]  the shoot, they put it in the show. So the CEO doesn't have a problem with a bunch of degenerates
[2:49:43.660 --> 2:49:49.100]  drooling over a 10-year-old boy in one of their series. And YouTube has a documentary about
[2:49:49.100 --> 2:49:55.260]  child drag queens called Drag Kids. You see Michael Strahan drooling over. Desmond is amazing on
[2:49:55.260 --> 2:50:00.940]  Good Morning America. So that's where we're at now. We're in a society where a white kid can't dress
[2:50:00.940 --> 2:50:06.540]  up as Mr. T. I'm kind of dating myself here. But for Halloween or dress up as a Moana Disney
[2:50:06.540 --> 2:50:12.060]  costume, that's blackface. That's cultural appropriation. But Good Morning America on ABC
[2:50:12.060 --> 2:50:17.100]  with Michael Strahan brings out a child drag queen. You know, 10 years ago, that would cause a
[2:50:17.100 --> 2:50:20.940]  national outrage. Somebody like that, whoever the producer would be fired, they would be
[2:50:20.940 --> 2:50:25.980]  investigated for child abuse. Michael Strahan would be shunny but never work again. But he just goes
[2:50:25.980 --> 2:50:30.220]  on. I think anybody if you're on Twitter should just tweet Michael Strahan. He loves child drag
[2:50:30.220 --> 2:50:35.100]  queens. You should see him just applauding. He's amazing. He's a trailblazer. They're celebrating
[2:50:35.100 --> 2:50:40.300]  the most evil degeneracy. And you know, that's one of the strikes that Alex got on YouTube is for
[2:50:40.300 --> 2:50:46.140]  denouncing children at a drag queen festival, bringing dollar bills. He called them degenerates.
[2:50:46.140 --> 2:50:49.180]  You're not allowed to do that. You're not allowed to hurt the drag queen's feelings.
[2:50:50.060 --> 2:50:53.100]  That's hate speech. So I don't know how much further it's going to go. I don't know if we're
[2:50:53.100 --> 2:50:57.180]  going to have the pendulum swinging the other way. Or if we're just going to have two different
[2:50:57.180 --> 2:51:03.820]  cultures where we're going to have the degenerate left and their cesspool of satanic, and that's
[2:51:03.820 --> 2:51:09.820]  what it is, degeneracy. Or and then we're going to have, you know, the daily wire. I got some
[2:51:09.820 --> 2:51:14.460]  serious disagreements with Ben Shapiro, but the daily wire, they're growing into an entertainment
[2:51:15.740 --> 2:51:21.180]  giant. You know, they're producing films now. And it's hard to imagine that this thing doesn't
[2:51:21.180 --> 2:51:25.340]  get back to normal at some point. I mean, it's hard to imagine humanity is going to go into this
[2:51:25.340 --> 2:51:32.140]  age of darkness and demonic activity. And as Putin put it, he says that America has gone
[2:51:32.140 --> 2:51:36.940]  completely insane, subverting human nature, allowing the gender mob to take over. But you
[2:51:36.940 --> 2:51:41.740]  know, Mark, and this is a more esoteric, you know, you know, bloodlines of the aluminum,
[2:51:41.740 --> 2:51:46.300]  a naughty type thing. But you know, what I've noticed here is that, look, we know that they have
[2:51:46.860 --> 2:51:51.900]  control over people in the media, in government, with blackmail, all kinds of different kinds of
[2:51:51.900 --> 2:51:58.300]  blackmail. And I think what we're seeing now is we're starting to see the subtle signs of who
[2:51:58.300 --> 2:52:03.580]  these people are. If you pay close attention, I won't make any accusations here. But I think
[2:52:03.580 --> 2:52:10.300]  when you pay close attention, you can tell and you're like, this behavior is so erratic and
[2:52:10.300 --> 2:52:16.220]  unexplicable. How is it? What is going on? Like, for example, again, I'm not trying to make any,
[2:52:16.220 --> 2:52:20.380]  I'm just using the example here. Stephen A. Smith on ESPN, we all know he's an avowed racist.
[2:52:21.100 --> 2:52:26.940]  He was in a debate with Jason Williams, who's a former basketball player. And Jason Williams
[2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:31.100]  simply says, Hey, you know, Kyrie Erring should have the freedom of choice to choose whether he
[2:52:31.100 --> 2:52:35.340]  wants to take a medical treatment or not. He should have the freedom of choice. And Stephen A.
[2:52:35.340 --> 2:52:42.380]  Smith like blows up, like blows up a gasket. And you're just sitting here like, what is your deal,
[2:52:42.380 --> 2:52:47.420]  dude? Who is it that you're trying to please that you have to act like such a freak on TV?
[2:52:48.940 --> 2:52:53.740]  Well, he's playing the new key, the new role of Keith Oberman, the unhinged sportscaster.
[2:52:53.740 --> 2:52:59.660]  And that's another symptom of the sickness in society, how the political propaganda has infested
[2:52:59.660 --> 2:53:04.540]  entertainment in a way that we've never seen before, because it's in sports. It's even in
[2:53:04.540 --> 2:53:09.980]  commercials. And the shameless plug, my last book, Hollywood propaganda covers how they're
[2:53:09.980 --> 2:53:16.700]  actually lobbying agencies that lobby Hollywood studios to insert political messages into shows
[2:53:16.700 --> 2:53:23.180]  and into movies. So just like lobbyists, wine and dine members of Congress, try to get bills passed
[2:53:23.180 --> 2:53:28.620]  or try to, you know, get them to vote certain ways. There are lobbyist organizations and I name
[2:53:28.620 --> 2:53:34.540]  them, I detail them in the book, who lobby Hollywood studios and the writers, the producers
[2:53:35.340 --> 2:53:40.060]  to insert messages into shows. And we've seen many clear examples of this. They're quite open
[2:53:40.060 --> 2:53:44.940]  about some of their, what they call their successes. And it's not only in the entertainment,
[2:53:44.940 --> 2:53:49.180]  it's also in the commercials, as you may have noticed, you can't watch a commercial now without
[2:53:49.180 --> 2:53:56.380]  being bombarded by drag queens and social justice messages. And even Roy Ritz Cracker last Christmas
[2:53:56.380 --> 2:54:01.740]  had a Christmas special where a guy brought his boyfriend over to meet the family. And for extra
[2:54:01.740 --> 2:54:07.420]  diversity, he was Blacks. It's an interracial gay couple. And for even extra, extra diversity,
[2:54:07.980 --> 2:54:13.980]  he was a gender non binary Black man with lipstick. Did you see that one? So now you can't even
[2:54:13.980 --> 2:54:17.900]  watch a commercial. For a Cracker, for a Ritz Cracker, which I don't know, Crackers, that may
[2:54:17.900 --> 2:54:21.660]  be a racist, you know, trope too. I don't know if you can even say Cracker. And it reminds me of
[2:54:21.660 --> 2:54:27.500]  this cartoon. It's a four frame cartoon. And this guy, he presents, he presents an image to the,
[2:54:27.500 --> 2:54:32.300]  to what appears to be like a marketing board. And it's a picture of a hamburger. But it's
[2:54:32.300 --> 2:54:37.820]  a picture of two guys kissing with a hamburger behind it. And the guy, and then the marketing
[2:54:37.820 --> 2:54:42.380]  board goes, are you sure this will help us sell burgers? And it goes back to the guy and he goes,
[2:54:42.380 --> 2:54:46.940]  burgers. Because it's like, it's, you're not, it's not even marketing anymore. It's all propaganda.
[2:54:46.940 --> 2:54:53.180]  It's not even about marketing. There was a child drag queen segment in a commercial for insurance.
[2:54:53.820 --> 2:54:57.260]  And I don't know if it was the same company or not, but another company just released another
[2:54:57.260 --> 2:55:02.540]  commercial with a boy dressed in a dress with lipstick on, running around the house. And it,
[2:55:02.540 --> 2:55:08.860]  it's becoming so subtle, but they're just, it's this constant trickle. And it's turning into a,
[2:55:09.500 --> 2:55:12.860]  an onslaught where you're just watching a commercial, you know, different people,
[2:55:12.860 --> 2:55:16.540]  different families, and they're talking about insurance. Everybody needs insurance. And
[2:55:16.540 --> 2:55:22.700]  there's a drag queen reading books to children and they're all happy. And it's because
[2:55:23.740 --> 2:55:29.260]  these, it started really from the lobbyists. And now it's become this virtue signal where,
[2:55:29.260 --> 2:55:35.340]  oh, how much more diverse can our commercial be? And it's just spiraling out of control. It's
[2:55:35.340 --> 2:55:42.220]  disgusting. I can't even watch normal television now without having the commercials preaching
[2:55:42.220 --> 2:55:47.980]  social justice. As you know, it's odd. It's odd because it's, it's, they're preaching to such
[2:55:47.980 --> 2:55:52.780]  a small segment of society. So it's obviously not about promoting the product. Yeah. And that's
[2:55:52.780 --> 2:55:55.740]  what it is. About promoting the agenda is that they don't even care anymore. They look at it,
[2:55:55.740 --> 2:55:58.700]  because they've already conquered it. So now they're just going to force feed us with their
[2:55:58.700 --> 2:56:02.780]  propaganda. And you know, one more thing here before we let you go, I was telling you the
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:06.140]  story earlier. So, so the stories in the Huffington Post, and it just shows you the mindset.
[2:56:07.020 --> 2:56:10.940]  A white woman told me she doesn't think of me as black. Here's how I react. And again,
[2:56:10.940 --> 2:56:15.020]  it's all about not being racist. It's all about actually living Martin Luther King's dream of
[2:56:15.020 --> 2:56:19.100]  not caring what your skin color is, but who you are as a person and your character. And she talks
[2:56:19.100 --> 2:56:23.820]  about how mad she is that she's not considered a black woman and she is a black woman. And she,
[2:56:23.820 --> 2:56:27.660]  her people have gone through all the struggle and now she's not even recognized. It's all this stuff.
[2:56:27.660 --> 2:56:31.100]  And she's married to a white man and people use that against her and all of this stuff. And it's
[2:56:31.100 --> 2:56:35.660]  just like, you just realized, and then here's a statement from Ibrahim Kendi today, who's the
[2:56:35.660 --> 2:56:41.820]  creator of critical race theory. He says, racism now racism tomorrow racism forever. Okay, I guess
[2:56:41.820 --> 2:56:46.140]  that shows his policy there. And he says permanently banning what they call critical race theory is
[2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:51.580]  about permanent provision, preservation of racism. That's what they're doing. They're the ones that
[2:56:51.580 --> 2:56:57.100]  are trying to preserve racist. They are the racist. They admit it. And they do it for their own selfish
[2:56:57.100 --> 2:57:01.900]  means of creating the victim, the victim economy and saying, I'm the biggest victim. Therefore,
[2:57:01.900 --> 2:57:06.940]  I should get everything and do whatever I want and dominate society. They pushed so hard that
[2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:12.380]  we're seeing even members of Congress now and people who would never touch pushing back with a
[2:57:12.380 --> 2:57:18.140]  10 foot pole, just even saying, Hey, you know what? Black people can be racist too. Just saying that
[2:57:18.140 --> 2:57:21.980]  a couple years ago would get you deemed a racist. And so I think we should start throwing their
[2:57:21.980 --> 2:57:27.020]  terms back in their face. Black privilege, they have black privilege. They have black fragility.
[2:57:27.020 --> 2:57:31.580]  You know, there's a, oh, it is. I mean, if you, if you, you know, you crack jokes about them and they,
[2:57:31.580 --> 2:57:35.580]  they get upset, it's black fragility. When you start mocking them and using their very own terms,
[2:57:35.580 --> 2:57:40.460]  just like we did with fake news, they tried to call us fake news. And when President Trump
[2:57:40.460 --> 2:57:45.580]  slams, Mark dies ahead of the times, Mark, we love you. Great stuff on your channel as always.
[2:57:46.220 --> 2:57:51.500]  By now, you've heard me talk. One of the most studied and researched areas of human health and
[2:57:51.500 --> 2:57:57.020]  physiology is inflammation. It's associated with cancer. It's associated with joint problems. It's
[2:57:57.020 --> 2:58:01.900]  associated with viral infections, bacterial infections. It's associated with death. And out
[2:58:01.900 --> 2:58:06.780]  of all the incredible compounds that God gave us through nature that fights inflammation and makes
[2:58:06.780 --> 2:58:12.700]  our lives better, turmeric is chief amongst them all. And chief amongst all the turmeric products
[2:58:12.700 --> 2:58:17.660]  out there is body's ultimate turmeric formula. My wife loves turmeric. She has joint pain,
[2:58:17.660 --> 2:58:21.740]  but just take a lot of it, the type of stuff she buys at the grocery store for it to work.
[2:58:21.740 --> 2:58:25.980]  She started taking this and said, I only need to take one pill instead of four. Why is it so good?
[2:58:25.980 --> 2:58:31.420]  It's not just turmeric. It's concentrated with the proprietary process. It's back in stock.
[2:58:31.420 --> 2:58:37.820]  It's being sold out almost five months at infowarstore.com for 40% off. But supplies are
[2:58:37.820 --> 2:58:41.020]  going to sell out quick because of supply chain breakdowns. And because we will not lower the
[2:58:41.020 --> 2:58:45.020]  quality of this product. And bodies is one of our best selling products because it really does work
[2:58:45.020 --> 2:58:50.780]  and people love it. Get yours today at infowarstore.com. It was almost 15 years ago that I released my
[2:58:50.780 --> 2:58:56.220]  seminal film in-game blueprint for global enslavement. And in that documentary I predicted the
[2:58:56.220 --> 2:59:02.140]  globalist would establish world government by releasing a virus demanding that there be worldwide
[2:59:02.140 --> 2:59:07.260]  lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our industrial society. And now they've done it.
[2:59:08.060 --> 2:59:13.180]  How did I know they would do it? Because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own
[2:59:13.180 --> 2:59:17.900]  reports and internal meetings were leaked. You see, then I was tracking the Bilderberg group,
[2:59:17.900 --> 2:59:22.940]  who's head at the time, was Klaus Schwab. And our sources inside were confirming to us that they
[2:59:22.940 --> 2:59:28.140]  were indeed planning to launch this great reset. Well, we're now living in it. The purposeful
[2:59:28.140 --> 2:59:32.620]  collapse of the third world and the first world. None is asked. It's a tyrannical corporate world
[2:59:32.620 --> 2:59:39.100]  government. The total censorship, no due process, destruction of the family, and then incrementally
[2:59:39.100 --> 2:59:44.140]  more and more deadly injections of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us in the
[2:59:44.140 --> 2:59:47.660]  populace. This is what info wars is fighting. We're fighting for the future.
[2:59:51.100 --> 2:59:55.100]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:01.340 --> 3:00:03.900]  All right, as usual, too much news, not enough time.
[3:00:03.900 --> 3:00:10.780]  And we've got Stu Peters coming up and I'll be back on the war room in an hour as well.
[3:00:11.660 --> 3:00:14.700]  So let me just try to get a couple things on my desk and I'll cover the rest later.
[3:00:15.500 --> 3:00:22.300]  I can't push this off anymore. I've got to explain what's going on. And for obvious reasons, I'm
[3:00:23.420 --> 3:00:28.860]  limiting my coverage of this news, but no one else will cover it. So I'll go ahead and put
[3:00:28.860 --> 3:00:34.220]  my neck out there to do it. Headline from a national file. Robert Mueller investigated for
[3:00:34.220 --> 3:00:45.820]  staging the militia hoax now used to prosecute January 6 defendant. And so in 2010, the FBI did
[3:00:47.100 --> 3:00:53.980]  their sting operations, which is sending feds into a situation to set up somebody for a criminal
[3:00:53.980 --> 3:00:58.940]  charge. We saw it in Michigan when they tried to set up people to kidnap Governor Whitmer. It
[3:00:58.940 --> 3:01:03.900]  turned out to be nothing but feds doing it. They got caught. No punishment for them, though, doing
[3:01:03.900 --> 3:01:07.020]  it, doing the crime. Now, if somebody else did it, they would be in jail. They'd faced law. But
[3:01:07.020 --> 3:01:11.820]  because because it was feds doing it, they get to wipe their hands with it and have no qualms.
[3:01:11.820 --> 3:01:17.180]  And it's all because of this Robert Mueller case. So what happened was they set this guy up for a
[3:01:17.180 --> 3:01:23.340]  gun charge. The fed set him up. And then when they got caught setting him up, the precedent was that,
[3:01:23.340 --> 3:01:27.580]  well, the federal government's allowed to do that. So think about it like this. The federal
[3:01:27.580 --> 3:01:34.060]  government is allowed to lie. The federal government is allowed to set you up. And then that same
[3:01:34.060 --> 3:01:38.780]  federal government is allowed to run the court case and the legal case against you. So they lie
[3:01:38.780 --> 3:01:43.660]  about you. They lie to you. Then they set you up for a crime and a crime that they're actually
[3:01:43.660 --> 3:01:48.620]  involved in executing. And then they're allowed to prosecute you in a court of law after they did
[3:01:48.620 --> 3:01:54.300]  everything setting you up. And that's the precedent that was set by Robert Mueller's FBI that they're
[3:01:54.300 --> 3:01:58.220]  now using as the precedent on January 6th. And you may say, well, why are they using it as the
[3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:04.940]  precedent on January 6th? Folks, put two and two together. Why are they using a precedent
[3:02:04.940 --> 3:02:10.780]  that feds can set you up for a crime to go after people on January 6th? Do you understand what
[3:02:10.780 --> 3:02:16.620]  I'm saying here? Are you reading between the tea leaves? Again, I'm on trial every day I'm on
[3:02:16.620 --> 3:02:21.260]  air. Okay, so I'm trying to be cautious about how I report this stuff. But do you see what's
[3:02:21.260 --> 3:02:27.500]  going on in all the other videos that are now surfacing from January 6th? And this is just
[3:02:27.500 --> 3:02:33.740]  disgusting what's happening. Again, nobody else will cover this, so I have to do it. But folks,
[3:02:33.740 --> 3:02:37.820]  they're currently holding somebody in jail for nine months. This individual has been in jail,
[3:02:37.820 --> 3:02:43.020]  Troy Smocks, for nine months. Did he go into the Capitol? Nope. Was he on the Capitol grounds? Nope.
[3:02:43.020 --> 3:02:48.540]  Nope. But he made a parlor post that said, let's hunt these cowards down like the traders that
[3:02:48.540 --> 3:02:55.180]  each of them are. He said, rhinos, dems and tech execs, let's hunt these cowards down like the
[3:02:55.180 --> 3:03:00.460]  traders that each of them are. He's been in jail for nine months for that post on parlor for nine
[3:03:00.460 --> 3:03:07.020]  months. Now, you want to make the argument that you should be in jail for a post you make on the
[3:03:07.020 --> 3:03:13.900]  internet? Fine. Make that argument. But how about a little equal justice here? How about a little
[3:03:13.900 --> 3:03:18.060]  equal application of that law or that precedent, the law that doesn't exist or that precedent that
[3:03:18.060 --> 3:03:23.580]  they're building now? Do you know how many leftists make death threats every day on Twitter to
[3:03:23.580 --> 3:03:28.860]  numerous individuals, including myself? Do you know how many of them have ever been investigated,
[3:03:28.860 --> 3:03:35.180]  let alone charged or spent a day in jail? Yeah, zero. We all know that. This is very dangerous
[3:03:35.180 --> 3:03:39.820]  here, folks. These are two very dangerous precedents that the federal government is allowed to lie
[3:03:39.820 --> 3:03:45.980]  and set you up and persecute you in court. And now they're able to go after you for something
[3:03:45.980 --> 3:03:52.540]  you posted on the internet. And it's all only for political purposes. Very dangerous stuff here,
[3:03:52.540 --> 3:04:02.860]  folks. Very, very dangerous stuff here, folks. And I just, I hope that that there's leaders
[3:04:02.860 --> 3:04:06.540]  in our Congress that wake up to this and do something about it before it gets worse.
[3:04:07.420 --> 3:04:11.580]  Notice how they still haven't found out who the alleged pipe bomber is.
[3:04:12.380 --> 3:04:17.420]  They still haven't gone after the individual who on six different occasions can be seen
[3:04:17.420 --> 3:04:22.060]  encouraging people to go into the Capitol building. And people, every time people are like,
[3:04:22.060 --> 3:04:26.220]  you're a fed, leave us alone. They can't fed. And he's on six different times, he's encouraging
[3:04:26.220 --> 3:04:31.020]  people to go into the building. They don't show the videos of all the people clad in black that
[3:04:31.020 --> 3:04:35.980]  actually break into the Capitol and then usher all the other people in. You never see or hear
[3:04:35.980 --> 3:04:41.260]  about who they are. But oh, grandma with an American flag. Oh, the guy that made a post on
[3:04:41.260 --> 3:04:46.700]  Parler. Oh, anybody else in the area that supported Trump, you're all being persecuted. But the actual
[3:04:46.700 --> 3:04:52.460]  criminals and the federal government who's setting it all up, they get away as usual. Very sad.
[3:04:52.460 --> 3:05:01.900]  Stu Peters up next. Alex Jones here. I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[3:05:01.900 --> 3:05:06.780]  deep in my soul. I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of loss.
[3:05:07.500 --> 3:05:13.580]  Like everybody else has. And it's because it's a loss of ancestral
[3:05:13.580 --> 3:05:23.740]  freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for. And now we're just throwing
[3:05:23.740 --> 3:05:30.140]  it all away. I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced,
[3:05:30.140 --> 3:05:37.180]  behavioral psychologically controlled tranche. And I know we're being fed into this global
[3:05:37.180 --> 3:05:44.300]  speaker under and it's so incredibly sad. But this is the process of birth and then growth and then
[3:05:45.180 --> 3:05:49.020]  falling apart and then generating collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[3:05:49.980 --> 3:05:54.620]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence and
[3:05:54.620 --> 3:06:11.980]  collapse to actually end the species as we know it. I'm right there with Owen Schreuer,
[3:06:11.980 --> 3:06:17.100]  you know, just praying every single day that these so called lawmakers, these so called
[3:06:17.100 --> 3:06:22.780]  elected representatives are going to wake up, do their job, start recognizing this Marxist coup
[3:06:22.780 --> 3:06:27.420]  for what it is. I mean, the prosecution and persecution of people. We've talked to pastors
[3:06:27.420 --> 3:06:32.060]  on this program, Owen himself with this malicious prosecution, all of these people being hunted
[3:06:32.060 --> 3:06:35.740]  down for not even being there, not even on the grounds, not going in there, not doing anything
[3:06:35.740 --> 3:06:43.100]  violent. I personally know a journalist who was right alongside, by the way, CNN. Nobody from
[3:06:43.100 --> 3:06:49.820]  that agency is being prosecuted. The journalist that I know on the other hand, looking at close
[3:06:49.820 --> 3:06:55.420]  to a decade for misdemeanors. There was no inciting of violence. There was no destruction
[3:06:55.420 --> 3:07:01.580]  of property. There was no impeding of Congress. None of that ushered in by police.
[3:07:04.300 --> 3:07:11.020]  And he's being charged in the same way that we're praying that these lawmakers will open up their
[3:07:11.020 --> 3:07:17.420]  eyes and do something about that. What about the killing of our kids? You know, it's no secret to
[3:07:17.420 --> 3:07:21.500]  anybody that the White House is now saying they're rolling out what, 32, 38 million shots
[3:07:22.300 --> 3:07:26.780]  for kids ages five to 11. So let's break that down. Oh, they've even gotten so creepy now,
[3:07:27.500 --> 3:07:33.020]  that they're also going to be shipping tens of millions of little tiny sized child arm sized
[3:07:33.020 --> 3:07:40.460]  needles along with these shots. So let's break it down. Well, in the age group of 12 to 17,
[3:07:40.460 --> 3:07:49.260]  we have already seen that boys, particularly, are six times more likely to have a serious
[3:07:49.260 --> 3:07:55.740]  myocarditis event, a serious heart issue from these shots. Then they are to have a serious
[3:07:55.740 --> 3:07:59.500]  illness from COVID because we know virtually no kids are impacted by COVID-19 at all.
[3:08:01.500 --> 3:08:06.940]  Now a doctor is coming out saying that in a really large hospital system, a large birthing place,
[3:08:06.940 --> 3:08:11.820]  that an alarming amount of babies are dying just hours after being born,
[3:08:13.500 --> 3:08:17.500]  all from the same thing, every one of them from the same thing. Pulmonary hemorrhage
[3:08:18.460 --> 3:08:23.260]  was the common denominator in all of them. Of course, the mothers were vaccinated. They're
[3:08:23.260 --> 3:08:27.980]  either breastfeeding or the children were the babies were vaccinated in vitro. And so now why
[3:08:27.980 --> 3:08:34.380]  not? Why not? We're killing babies. We're killing adolescent teen boys. We're permanently incapacitating
[3:08:34.380 --> 3:08:40.220]  people. We're forever changing their lives. So along with praying that lawmakers wake up,
[3:08:41.500 --> 3:08:47.260]  obviously it's time that we pray to God that our children are not the price that we have to pay for
[3:08:47.260 --> 3:08:58.300]  this tyranny. Dr. Paul Elias Alexander, former HHS, former who, he was a senior COVID advisor to
[3:08:58.300 --> 3:09:06.060]  President Donald Trump, and he joins us now. You've been doing a lot of studies on this vaccine.
[3:09:06.620 --> 3:09:13.660]  I really struggle calling it that. It's not FDA approved. This is a big propaganda thing. We're
[3:09:13.660 --> 3:09:19.580]  being told that it is. And we're going to get to your concerns about these five to 11 year olds.
[3:09:19.580 --> 3:09:26.780]  But I found something really interesting recently that you did a comparison of immunity from these
[3:09:26.780 --> 3:09:34.220]  shots versus natural immunity. What did you find? Well, I mean, Stu, thanks a lot. I'm very humble
[3:09:34.220 --> 3:09:40.780]  to be on your show. And we published that report in Brownstone Institute. And what we found was
[3:09:40.780 --> 3:09:47.580]  about 91 pieces of evidence or studies, high quality, that pretty much showed us that it's
[3:09:47.580 --> 3:09:52.700]  not just that the vaccines that the natural immunity is equal to vaccine immunity, but
[3:09:52.700 --> 3:09:58.700]  actually is more superior. And I think this is the argument. The argument is that before the
[3:09:58.700 --> 3:10:04.060]  vaccines came out, you know, there was this push to prepare the population by saying that, you
[3:10:04.060 --> 3:10:09.820]  know, your natural immunity is failing and you're losing it and it's declining. But that was a lie.
[3:10:09.820 --> 3:10:16.780]  That was a lie put out by by the administration, by the public health officials Fauci, Walensky,
[3:10:16.780 --> 3:10:23.180]  et cetera, because they knew it is normal for your antibodies. They were putting out some studies
[3:10:23.180 --> 3:10:27.980]  that the antibodies were failing. Well, they knew it was normal. You're not losing your immunity.
[3:10:27.980 --> 3:10:33.500]  They knew this because your immune system, your natural immunity is not just based on antibodies.
[3:10:33.500 --> 3:10:39.820]  Even if your antibodies disappear from circulation, they knew these scientists knew that is B cell,
[3:10:39.820 --> 3:10:45.180]  there's cellular immunity with B cells and T cells that produces antibodies in the future
[3:10:45.180 --> 3:10:51.020]  when you are when you are exposed. And your natural immunity is pretty much one one and done
[3:10:51.020 --> 3:10:58.300]  lifelong. So if you re expose, you have B cells, long live bone marrow plasma cells that will
[3:10:58.300 --> 3:11:04.860]  turn out new antibodies as needed. So this has been a lie to deceive people and to scare the
[3:11:04.860 --> 3:11:11.500]  population into vaccination. And when we looked at these 91 odd studies, we are seeing that natural
[3:11:11.500 --> 3:11:17.980]  immunity is not just equal. I'm making the argument that is superior to what is confirmed by the
[3:11:17.980 --> 3:11:23.660]  vaccine. And the public needs to understand that that what we're talking about here is that when
[3:11:23.660 --> 3:11:31.100]  you are exposed naturally to the pathogen, your immune system builds almost a complete shot of
[3:11:31.100 --> 3:11:38.460]  all aspects of the surface of the virus. You're talking about the envelope, the nucleocapsid protein,
[3:11:38.460 --> 3:11:46.220]  this fight protein versus the vaccine only allows you to produce an immune response antibodies to
[3:11:46.220 --> 3:11:53.100]  this fight protein. And we know that this fight protein was based on the initial Wuhan strain
[3:11:53.100 --> 3:12:00.300]  2020, January, February, March. Right now we have the Delta, the Delta variant. So the vaccine is
[3:12:00.300 --> 3:12:06.300]  not hitting the Delta. And that is why you are seeing so many quote unquote, breakthrough infections
[3:12:06.300 --> 3:12:13.180]  in Israel, UK, United States, Barnes, Stable, Massachusetts across the globe. It is a understood
[3:12:13.180 --> 3:12:19.340]  fact even the CDC Walensky said that there are breakthrough infections and that the vaccinated
[3:12:19.340 --> 3:12:26.940]  are getting infected. In fact, the vaccinated are spreading this virus. So we have a serious
[3:12:26.940 --> 3:12:33.980]  problem and like the lockdowns to these public health officials, they take the most ridiculous,
[3:12:33.980 --> 3:12:40.780]  illogical step forward with the lockdowns. When they realized and we saw that the lockdowns were
[3:12:40.780 --> 3:12:45.980]  killing people, not the virus. It was the lockdowns and the school closures. What did they do?
[3:12:46.620 --> 3:12:52.860]  They didn't meet and try to assess a better way forward. They decided to do more lockdowns and
[3:12:52.860 --> 3:12:59.100]  harden them. So right now we have a serious problem with the vaccine in terms of its effectiveness.
[3:12:59.100 --> 3:13:05.420]  And we are seeing a lot of harms. What do they do? They don't stop. They don't step back to try to
[3:13:05.420 --> 3:13:11.100]  understand what is happening here. It looks like the vaccine is causing a lot of problems. No,
[3:13:11.100 --> 3:13:16.220]  they harden and they want to expand to younger and younger persons. And now they have come into
[3:13:16.220 --> 3:13:24.140]  our kids five, 11. And we say no, there's no, no evidence, none, zero, where our children five,
[3:13:24.140 --> 3:13:29.900]  11 years old. There's any benefit from these vaccines. In fact, there's only potential for harms.
[3:13:30.860 --> 3:13:35.980]  Yeah, you know, part of the study that you're talking about, as far as the natural immunity is
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:43.260]  concerned, I was looking into this and it looks to me like those who contracted SARS-CoV-1
[3:13:44.780 --> 3:13:52.060]  and had the antibodies for that, when it was introduced in a lab to the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
[3:13:52.060 --> 3:14:00.380]  years later, those antibodies killed SARS-CoV-2. So people from 10 years ago or longer are immune
[3:14:00.380 --> 3:14:06.140]  automatically to SARS-CoV-2 if they had or had exposure to CoV-1, which is something that we
[3:14:06.140 --> 3:14:11.180]  really need to take into consideration given the fact that this is more than likely why the natural
[3:14:11.180 --> 3:14:15.820]  immune system without any early treatment, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, ventilators,
[3:14:15.820 --> 3:14:21.260]  the poisonous remdesivir, all of these things, the natural God-given immune system is defeating
[3:14:21.260 --> 3:14:28.060]  this virus 99.987% of the time because that is how our bodies are designed. And when you talk about
[3:14:28.060 --> 3:14:35.100]  the harm that these vaccines are causing in these age groups of 12 to 17, we've seen these
[3:14:35.660 --> 3:14:41.980]  spontaneous abortions or miscarriages. We've seen the death of newly born babies within hours of
[3:14:41.980 --> 3:14:47.820]  being born because of this pulmonary hemorrhage. It's extremely alarming. But as we continue to
[3:14:47.820 --> 3:14:52.460]  push this out and then tell people, well, now you have to have a booster because you're no longer
[3:14:52.460 --> 3:14:59.100]  immune, this is becoming to me more apparent that these are not necessarily side effects.
[3:14:59.980 --> 3:15:05.020]  We look at, for example, the vaccine adverse events reporting system that tells us now that
[3:15:05.020 --> 3:15:09.900]  what 17,000 people have died attributed to this shot, but there are so many other systems out
[3:15:09.900 --> 3:15:14.700]  there that suggest that many more, exponentially more people have actually succumbed to this
[3:15:14.700 --> 3:15:22.060]  and have had severe adverse events or reactions. But this is becoming to me very, very apparent.
[3:15:22.060 --> 3:15:25.340]  And I want to talk to you about this after the break in about 30 seconds. We've got to go to
[3:15:25.340 --> 3:15:29.420]  break. But I want to talk to you about this and let you think on this because this is really serious
[3:15:29.420 --> 3:15:39.500]  to me. This is not a conspiracy theory. This looks to me a lot less like side effects and a whole
[3:15:39.500 --> 3:15:47.020]  lot more like intended consequences. This is premeditated. There's enough, there's enough
[3:15:47.020 --> 3:15:52.220]  going on out here that these people can, they can understand this more with Dr. Alexander right after
[3:15:52.220 --> 3:16:01.740]  this. What if you could late August in full war saw an explosion of orders because our audience
[3:16:01.740 --> 3:16:08.140]  understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[3:16:08.140 --> 3:16:13.740]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen, storeable food has
[3:16:13.740 --> 3:16:17.660]  always been something that's important to have. It's a check box that everybody needs to have,
[3:16:17.660 --> 3:16:23.020]  taking care of, right along with water filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[3:16:23.020 --> 3:16:27.660]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in. Now we're ready to
[3:16:27.660 --> 3:16:32.140]  ship to you within 24 hours of your order. It's high quality. It's very, very low cost
[3:16:32.140 --> 3:16:37.820]  at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see more food supply shortages and you're
[3:16:37.820 --> 3:16:42.300]  going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place. So lock in your storeable
[3:16:42.300 --> 3:16:48.620]  food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com. That's how you fight the great
[3:16:48.620 --> 3:17:15.900]  reset is by being self-efficient and not under their control. So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[3:17:15.900 --> 3:17:22.540]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists. They must first play God. They must first
[3:17:23.420 --> 3:17:29.100]  prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system. And in a way,
[3:17:29.100 --> 3:17:34.700]  they're right. If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's
[3:17:34.700 --> 3:17:39.980]  futures and the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open, we really deserve what's happened to
[3:17:39.980 --> 3:17:48.060]  us. So I asked you now, are you going to step up and expose the dual order even more? I know I'm
[3:17:48.060 --> 3:17:54.540]  pledging to step up and redouble my efforts. The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.

[3:18:50.860 --> 3:18:59.500]  and see for yourself. I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul. I've
[3:18:59.500 --> 3:19:06.940]  ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has and it's because
[3:19:07.820 --> 3:19:17.740]  it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for
[3:19:19.020 --> 3:19:25.740]  and now we're just throwing it all away and I see that they're all public, ENA, medically induced,
[3:19:25.740 --> 3:19:33.100]  scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled, cranky and I know we're being fed
[3:19:33.100 --> 3:19:39.740]  into this globalist meat grinder and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth
[3:19:39.740 --> 3:19:45.180]  and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back
[3:19:45.180 --> 3:19:50.700]  to life again. It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process
[3:19:50.700 --> 3:19:59.900]  of death and it's a collapse to actually end the species as we know it. You're listening to the Alex
[3:19:59.900 --> 3:20:20.540]  Jones show. More than twice as many more than double the amount of people
[3:20:20.540 --> 3:20:26.780]  have died reportedly from this shot being referred to as a vaccine in nine months
[3:20:27.580 --> 3:20:34.620]  then have died from all previous vaccines combined and that's according to the vaccine adverse events
[3:20:34.620 --> 3:20:38.140]  reporting system which we know those numbers are throttled. We know them to be much higher
[3:20:38.140 --> 3:20:43.580]  because of whistleblowers, because of actual complaints filed under the penalty of perjury.
[3:20:43.580 --> 3:20:47.820]  We know that those numbers are much greater but those are the numbers that we can acknowledge
[3:20:47.820 --> 3:20:55.260]  here with some sort of responsibility but that's not enough. I mean close to 17,000 people or more,
[3:20:56.700 --> 3:21:04.380]  790 some thousand adverse events, close to 3,000 miscarriages, permanently disabled people,
[3:21:04.380 --> 3:21:11.180]  near 30,000 people. I mean all of these people dying within days of this shot which provides
[3:21:11.180 --> 3:21:17.100]  by the way no immunity whatsoever and if you look at CNN Health one of their headlines was
[3:21:17.100 --> 3:21:22.540]  you know just because people are getting COVID after being vaccinated doesn't mean
[3:21:22.540 --> 3:21:27.900]  that the vaccine is ineffective. I mean this is the type of propaganda that is being shoved
[3:21:27.900 --> 3:21:33.180]  down the throats of American people. This is the kind of panic that is being caused in order to
[3:21:33.180 --> 3:21:38.780]  provoke parents to trip over themselves to get to the front of the line to have their children,
[3:21:38.780 --> 3:21:45.180]  their innocent children's DNA possibly restructured as a result of accepting this therapeutic
[3:21:45.180 --> 3:21:50.700]  that we by all intents and purposes by definition cannot call a vaccine. It's harmful.
[3:21:52.060 --> 3:21:59.660]  At what point does this become not side effects but actually intended consequences
[3:21:59.660 --> 3:22:06.140]  when we have all of this data? Dr. Paul Elias Alexander was a senior advisor to President
[3:22:06.140 --> 3:22:13.180]  Trump working with HHS. I mean what are your thoughts on this? This looks to be intentional
[3:22:13.180 --> 3:22:20.540]  at this point. Well Stu again once again I'm very grateful to be on your show and I want to make
[3:22:20.540 --> 3:22:27.180]  sure I make it known that I support President Trump and his policies and I still do today.
[3:22:27.180 --> 3:22:33.660]  I do have a serious serious concern with these vaccines for children. I don't think they're
[3:22:33.660 --> 3:22:39.340]  indicated in any manner possible so I want President Trump to come forward and put a stop.
[3:22:39.340 --> 3:22:44.540]  He has to make a statement on this and look I agreed what you're saying because remember
[3:22:44.540 --> 3:22:51.820]  the natural immunity that we have with natural exposure with our cellular immunity so T-cell
[3:22:51.820 --> 3:22:59.740]  B-cell response is lifelong. You mentioned just now about that study that study by Laboot
[3:22:59.740 --> 3:23:05.980]  where they found that persons who were infected from SARS-1 that when they looked at their blood
[3:23:05.980 --> 3:23:12.940]  17-18 years post they found still a reaction to the virus and also a cross-reactivity cross
[3:23:12.940 --> 3:23:20.940]  protection to SARS-2. We even found that in 1918 Spanish flu they looked at persons blood in 2008-2010
[3:23:20.940 --> 3:23:27.500]  almost 100 years had passed and they found that those persons who were still alive had immunity
[3:23:27.500 --> 3:23:32.700]  in their blood that reacted to the Spanish flu that they were exposed to 100 years prior
[3:23:32.700 --> 3:23:38.220]  and I have to agree with you Stu because look right now we're looking at the adverse events
[3:23:38.220 --> 3:23:44.220]  that have accumulated in the VAERS database and the VAERS only accounts for what 1% let's
[3:23:44.220 --> 3:23:52.140]  find the capital and say as much as 10 but we have about 16-17,000 deaths today we have 700-800,000
[3:23:52.140 --> 3:23:58.860]  adverse events and the challenges the administration the senior people in these health agencies
[3:23:58.860 --> 3:24:05.740]  they operate as though the CDC VAERS database just does not exist so if you say it's a 10%
[3:24:06.380 --> 3:24:13.340]  reporting we have 90% of the deaths and the adverse events miss and the problem here is this
[3:24:14.140 --> 3:24:21.820]  when you vaccinate with a suboptimal vaccine there's this issue of the original antigenic
[3:24:21.820 --> 3:24:29.340]  sin where if you prime the immune system suboptimally your first time out that suboptimal priming of
[3:24:29.340 --> 3:24:35.180]  the immune system will persist lifelong and it will be a suboptimal response from you we have a
[3:24:35.180 --> 3:24:40.380]  vaccine the day of manufacture and this is where the intent I would make a statement here in
[3:24:40.380 --> 3:24:45.740]  agreement with you I think this was almost designed to fail I think in a certain way
[3:24:45.740 --> 3:24:52.140]  it's beginning to look like this is how you roll out a vaccine or bring a vaccine to market
[3:24:52.140 --> 3:24:59.100]  that is going to fail almost as so as if if this were President Trump on deck now this would be hung
[3:24:59.100 --> 3:25:04.860]  around his neck but the devastation from the vaccine is not being looked at and is covered up
[3:25:04.860 --> 3:25:12.140]  almost by the media the reality about it is right now they have bought a vaccine that does not stop
[3:25:12.140 --> 3:25:19.340]  transmission it does not stop infection it does not stop severe COVID it does not stop
[3:25:19.340 --> 3:25:25.580]  death or hospitalization that's not me that is the vaccine developers put that out that's what
[3:25:25.580 --> 3:25:32.060]  was put up by the FDA that's what is published that's public information this these vaccines only
[3:25:32.460 --> 3:25:40.700]  handle and address the reducing mild COVID symptoms so it's almost as though you have given the virus
[3:25:40.700 --> 3:25:48.380]  an evolutionary future that it would not necessarily have you've extended the life of the virus so
[3:25:48.380 --> 3:25:55.660]  we have people now in the UK and Israel and these places where everyone is being double vaccinated
[3:25:55.660 --> 3:26:03.900]  is becoming infected why it seems that the vaccine itself and we warned that we wrote this and we said
[3:26:03.900 --> 3:26:12.060]  it Dr. Goethe Van den Bosch Dr. Yidne et cetera stated this we said on paper that if you vaccinate
[3:26:12.060 --> 3:26:19.980]  during an ongoing epidemic or pandemic you are going to drive the emergence of more infectious
[3:26:19.980 --> 3:26:26.060]  variants and potentially super variants that are devastatingly and could be deadly and that is what
[3:26:26.060 --> 3:26:31.820]  we are probably doing now and we are seeing it playing out where the vaccinated are the ones
[3:26:31.820 --> 3:26:37.980]  actually spreading this virus this is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated that was a false
[3:26:37.980 --> 3:26:43.820]  talking point put out there this is actually a pandemic of the vaccinated we have the research
[3:26:43.820 --> 3:26:49.980]  that shows the vaccinated harbors as high or even more higher loads of the virus in the
[3:26:49.980 --> 3:26:56.540]  oral pharyngeal passages and they are propagating this virus to the unvaccinated and even to the
[3:26:56.540 --> 3:27:03.260]  vaccinated i got about one minute left here i want you to address lawmakers president trump
[3:27:03.260 --> 3:27:09.260]  whoever it is that you think has sway over hundreds of millions of people or this push
[3:27:09.260 --> 3:27:13.740]  for five to eleven year old specifically i've got two kids between the ages of five and eleven
[3:27:14.460 --> 3:27:21.420]  and and this is horrific for me to think about yes well i mean look let's be blunt about this
[3:27:21.420 --> 3:27:26.700]  i've been on record i've been speaking on the news other people like dr mccullough dr reach these
[3:27:26.700 --> 3:27:32.300]  people we have been out there fighting this it's absolutely under no condition none must appear
[3:27:32.300 --> 3:27:38.540]  into the united states allow these vaccines into their children this push five five zero five eleven
[3:27:38.540 --> 3:27:43.820]  they do not have the evidence to show here's the key that a parent must and i'm pleading with
[3:27:43.820 --> 3:27:51.260]  president trump and the lawmakers to understand these vaccine developers needed 10 to 12 to 15 years
[3:27:51.260 --> 3:27:56.540]  they brought this in three months to four months they did not follow these vaccines for the proper
[3:27:56.540 --> 3:28:02.940]  duration of time to detect the safety signals that we know will emerge and now we are seeing it in
[3:28:02.940 --> 3:28:10.780]  the adults we are asking president trump to step forward and put a stop stop this with the children
[3:28:10.780 --> 3:28:17.180]  because children bring almost near statistical zero risk to the table this is the issue they bring
[3:28:17.180 --> 3:28:23.500]  no risk to the table yet you want to give them a vaccine that we have seen has potential risks so
[3:28:23.500 --> 3:28:29.500]  then what is your reason for this why why would you do this to your child your child has a life
[3:28:29.500 --> 3:28:36.140]  18 90 years ahead of them by introducing these vaccines we run the risk of disabling them or
[3:28:36.140 --> 3:28:43.260]  possibly killing them i am saying here again we have adults 16 to 17 thousand we actually
[3:28:43.260 --> 3:28:49.820]  model it as a hundred thousand who've died in america wanted to defy this post vaccine i'm saying
[3:28:51.820 --> 3:28:58.780]  here i gotta go stop this thing paul elizander thank you you know listen the covid-19 face diaper
[3:28:58.780 --> 3:29:07.020]  is a symbol of subservience a symbol of slavery a symbol of the change that the medical tyranny
[3:29:07.020 --> 3:29:12.540]  combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place it is the symbol
[3:29:13.180 --> 3:29:19.020]  of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge it is the symbol that we are diseased
[3:29:19.020 --> 3:29:25.980]  and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun it is
[3:29:25.980 --> 3:29:35.180]  the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil ladies and gentlemen we are
[3:29:35.180 --> 3:29:41.980]  crossing the rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon us claus Schwab and the you
[3:29:41.980 --> 3:29:45.980]  and admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the world id and carbon
[3:29:45.980 --> 3:29:52.940]  taxes things only get worse from here if we submit they only get better if we resist and say no

[3:32:53.660 --> 3:33:05.580]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:05.580 --> 3:33:27.420]  it is so challenging i think the biggest challenge for me to sit in this chair every day
[3:33:27.420 --> 3:33:36.860]  is to try to maintain some level headedness and not pull what's left of my hair directly out of
[3:33:36.860 --> 3:33:44.620]  my head i mean the emotions from from grief to anger listening to these emails that come in by
[3:33:44.620 --> 3:33:50.780]  the thousands of of people who are are so desperate begging for attention to this and we're giving it
[3:33:50.780 --> 3:33:58.460]  all of the attention here info wars alex jones oh and shroyer the whole crew over at stew peters
[3:33:58.460 --> 3:34:05.740]  dot tv i mean i know so many so many people millions of people know what's really going on here
[3:34:07.340 --> 3:34:10.780]  but yet it just continues and not only does it continue it just ramps up
[3:34:11.420 --> 3:34:17.100]  and you see these people outside wearing their masks alone by themselves what are you so afraid of
[3:34:17.100 --> 3:34:21.580]  sir ma'am what are what exactly are you protecting yourself from
[3:34:25.100 --> 3:34:30.860]  and in the name of something that's killing virtually nobody on its own without serious
[3:34:30.860 --> 3:34:38.940]  underlying conditions or extreme old age i mean somebody just has to say it these people were
[3:34:38.940 --> 3:34:42.780]  going to die anyways no matter what they got they were going to die it doesn't mean that their death
[3:34:42.780 --> 3:34:47.420]  is any less tragic it doesn't mean that their families and their loved ones will miss them any less
[3:34:48.780 --> 3:34:52.940]  it's not being being insensitive this is this is just the truth i don't really care about your
[3:34:52.940 --> 3:34:59.340]  feelings i care about your future the truth is we're running away from a virus that literally
[3:34:59.340 --> 3:35:05.180]  kills virtually nobody and the whole world has been locked down and there are wild and crazy
[3:35:05.180 --> 3:35:11.180]  conspiracy theories about why but conspiracy theorists are being vindicated every day i'm
[3:35:11.180 --> 3:35:13.900]  almost out of conspiracy theories they've virtually all come true
[3:35:16.380 --> 3:35:20.860]  and we see what the world economic forum is doing and we see what's happening in australia
[3:35:20.860 --> 3:35:26.380]  and we see what bill gates is doing in africa and we see tony fauci just continuously lying to us
[3:35:30.620 --> 3:35:34.860]  it's just so aggravating and and so frustrating to know that the price that we may have to pay is
[3:35:34.860 --> 3:35:41.580]  our children and you heard dr paul elias alexander here who still supports president trump
[3:35:43.980 --> 3:35:49.580]  if i hear president trump one more time touting these vaccines i might the universe might explode i
[3:35:49.580 --> 3:35:54.220]  mean seriously like like my face might blow off on my shoulders i don't know it's it's so frustrating
[3:35:54.220 --> 3:36:01.100]  it's appalling to me that the facts are this is a nothing virus that if we had done nothing about it
[3:36:01.100 --> 3:36:09.900]  at all would be by all intents and purposes gone dead over with finito that's how pandemics work
[3:36:11.900 --> 3:36:15.580]  every expert that we've talked to pandemics how long 18 months that's the lifespan
[3:36:16.780 --> 3:36:22.460]  it would be gone if we had done nothing about it it would be gone but like paul alexander suggested
[3:36:22.460 --> 3:36:27.820]  we're creating a super virus when people unnecessarily take antibiotics you create these super viruses
[3:36:27.820 --> 3:36:34.940]  super bugs and now there's all kinds of speculation about this other so-called virus that's not really
[3:36:34.940 --> 3:36:40.860]  a virus that they're going to try to scare us with and it's going to be so scary and so many
[3:36:40.860 --> 3:36:44.540]  people are going to die this was another conspiracy theory for the last few weeks you might have seen
[3:36:44.540 --> 3:36:51.420]  this all over the place this mall bird virus wild and crazy conspiracy theories now being pumped
[3:36:51.420 --> 3:36:58.940]  on federal government websites it's not a virus it's easily treatable with antibiotics virtually
[3:36:58.940 --> 3:37:04.780]  nobody that gets treatment for it dies but what's scary is that about 50 of untreated people do
[3:37:05.740 --> 3:37:11.260]  and so now this thing is going to be released making government lockdowns no longer required
[3:37:11.260 --> 3:37:16.060]  people will rush to lockdown on their own making the government push and the carrot dangling no
[3:37:16.060 --> 3:37:20.220]  longer required for shots in the arm because people will be rushing and tripping over themselves
[3:37:20.220 --> 3:37:27.260]  to get them this is how serious this really is and all of these wild and crazy conspiracy
[3:37:27.260 --> 3:37:32.060]  theories are now being vindicated by who by the FDA themselves just today or the other day they
[3:37:32.060 --> 3:37:36.220]  came out saying you know what it really doesn't matter what booster you take johnson and johnson
[3:37:36.220 --> 3:37:43.180]  fiser moderna astrazeneca that doesn't really matter let's mix and match dr jane ruby brought
[3:37:43.180 --> 3:37:47.980]  this to my attention today and she joins us now uh you're saying that this is going to create
[3:37:47.980 --> 3:37:54.620]  confusion chaos and certain death what is this mix and match bonanza that the FDA is now saying
[3:37:54.620 --> 3:38:03.260]  let's let's just do this stew it's going to further give the pharma companies cover not
[3:38:03.260 --> 3:38:07.900]  that they need any more cover than they have but the FDA came out yesterday with a statement on
[3:38:07.900 --> 3:38:13.420]  their website and then they included it in a nice little tweet thread where they said that yes indeed
[3:38:13.420 --> 3:38:18.700]  you can mix and match they literally call it mix and match and you know as a pharmaceutical drug
[3:38:18.700 --> 3:38:25.500]  developer for 20 years gladly no longer in that industry but i want to i want to remind the american
[3:38:25.500 --> 3:38:31.180]  people there's a process to doing something like this it's called drug drug interaction studies
[3:38:31.180 --> 3:38:38.620]  and it takes many months maybe several years we never just mix entities and if this isn't
[3:38:38.620 --> 3:38:45.100]  the red flag on the field the you know the five alarm fire i don't know what will be but basically
[3:38:45.100 --> 3:38:51.580]  what they're saying and they've done no studies on it the data presentation is a joke it's about
[3:38:51.580 --> 3:38:58.060]  using maybe 100 200 people which is not a study to look at efficacy and safety um they're coming
[3:38:58.060 --> 3:39:03.740]  up with well look if you got fiser for your first you know inoculation you can have moderna but you
[3:39:03.740 --> 3:39:10.300]  know your booster will be half dose i have no idea they present no information on what that's about
[3:39:10.300 --> 3:39:16.460]  and like i said it is going to create more confusion your as we go further into you know
[3:39:16.460 --> 3:39:21.020]  greater maiming and death and now we're going to go into five to 11 year olds by the way
[3:39:21.020 --> 3:39:25.180]  which you have to remember something children have more robust immune systems that's why
[3:39:25.180 --> 3:39:30.220]  they're healthier that's why they don't catch things as readily like c19 that's why they don't
[3:39:30.220 --> 3:39:38.060]  need 84 childhood vaccines um so so they they but they have a stronger more reactive immune system
[3:39:38.060 --> 3:39:44.700]  what you're about to cease to is going to be just on what we've been seeing in the adults in the teens
[3:39:44.700 --> 3:39:51.100]  i'm sorry to say i'm steroids it's going to be explosive we're going to and i hate to say this
[3:39:51.100 --> 3:39:57.900]  because i've lived my last six months a lot on your show trying to get people to stop and protect
[3:39:57.900 --> 3:40:03.580]  the babies and the children but i'm afraid that maybe what it's going to take is several thousand
[3:40:03.580 --> 3:40:10.140]  children to die in front of everyone to stop this thing to stop parents from marching these children
[3:40:10.140 --> 3:40:14.780]  and because i'm going to tell you something stew it's like groundhog day we've got the fda meeting
[3:40:14.780 --> 3:40:20.780]  on monday to look at a supposed briefing document that feiser's already come out with and they've
[3:40:20.780 --> 3:40:27.100]  they've said it's got 91 efficacy well wait a minute didn't they tell us that these these shots
[3:40:27.100 --> 3:40:33.820]  back in the early part of this year had 95 efficacy but now six months later oops it's only 30 percent
[3:40:33.820 --> 3:40:39.180]  take a booster come on guys it's the first two shots didn't work why would you want to take
[3:40:39.180 --> 3:40:46.300]  a third of the same thing this is just duping beyond belief stew and there's more tragedy
[3:40:47.340 --> 3:40:54.620]  i don't know how to frame this cognitive dissonance in a way that you know it can be
[3:40:54.620 --> 3:41:01.100]  really explained clearly because of my level of frustration with all of this personally
[3:41:02.380 --> 3:41:07.740]  knowing what's coming next because we watch i mean oan schreuer was talking about january
[3:41:07.740 --> 3:41:14.140]  six for example talking about muller and the weaponization of the fbi and why would they
[3:41:14.140 --> 3:41:20.620]  use the same precedent we know the answer to that because our history predicts what our future is
[3:41:20.620 --> 3:41:28.540]  going to be we know what the next steps are going to be and with these child shots coming out here
[3:41:29.100 --> 3:41:36.540]  what i see is going to happen is you're gonna have dads like me who says you know no no absolutely
[3:41:36.540 --> 3:41:41.980]  not you're not coming near my kid with your little mini child sized needle and you know your cookies
[3:41:41.980 --> 3:41:45.900]  and milk and your bribes for my child who by the way they're getting jabbed at school without parents
[3:41:45.900 --> 3:41:51.180]  knowing about it we've seen them mistakenly quote unquote get this thing at these ballgreens and cvs
[3:41:51.180 --> 3:41:56.700]  and all of this other stuff but what i see happening here and here goes my wild and crazy conspiracy
[3:41:56.700 --> 3:42:01.820]  theories but really not cops are going to be showing up at my door they're going to have child
[3:42:01.820 --> 3:42:07.260]  protective services with them they're going to say to me we understand mr peters that you know
[3:42:07.260 --> 3:42:12.220]  you're hesitant about getting your child vaccinated and we also understand that you're not vaccinated
[3:42:12.220 --> 3:42:16.700]  deem you to be a domestic terrorist this is kind of a this is a health and safety risk safety risk
[3:42:16.700 --> 3:42:22.220]  to your children we're going to remove the children you're under arrest by the way and also we saw
[3:42:22.220 --> 3:42:26.460]  your social media posts and all your television shows about how you were questioning the response
[3:42:26.460 --> 3:42:32.780]  to covet 19 we already saw we already saw from the department of homeland security the dhs bulletin
[3:42:32.780 --> 3:42:38.300]  if you question the response to covet protocol you could be considered a domestic terrorist
[3:42:38.300 --> 3:42:43.180]  if you question the 2020 election you can be considered a domestic terrorist and i'm telling
[3:42:43.180 --> 3:42:47.820]  people right now that if we don't come together this is what's going to happen and i want to talk
[3:42:47.820 --> 3:42:51.980]  to you more about this five to eleven year old age group when we return after the break with uh
[3:42:51.980 --> 3:43:02.220]  dr jane ruby one of the most studied and researched areas of human health and physiology is inflammation

[3:47:30.380 --> 3:47:35.020]  stu peters back here in the fourth and final hour of the alex jones show of course on shroyer coming
[3:47:35.020 --> 3:47:41.660]  up with the war room that's next always one of my favorites stu peters dot tv is where i reside
[3:47:41.660 --> 3:47:46.540]  if you'd come and find me i would appreciate it check it out see what you think you know for 200
[3:47:46.540 --> 3:47:55.900]  years america has been like this beacon of freedom for the entire world our declaration of independence
[3:47:55.900 --> 3:48:00.060]  is one of the most important documents ever written our constitution is by far the most
[3:48:00.060 --> 3:48:06.460]  successful of any country and now on shroyer's talking about about somebody being in jail for
[3:48:06.460 --> 3:48:16.540]  nine months for a facebook post nick fuentes he's 23 years old banned in real life from air b and b
[3:48:16.540 --> 3:48:25.100]  kicked off youtube twitch facebook twitter paypal venmo patreon Shopify stripe streamlabs coinbase
[3:48:25.100 --> 3:48:35.580]  reddit these bands are so aggressive and all for it's just free speech beach you're not allowed to
[3:48:35.580 --> 3:48:45.180]  question the regime and the people that i fear for the most here are parents of children in homes
[3:48:45.180 --> 3:48:51.420]  where there is a disagreement about the safety and the efficacy or the conspiracies surrounding
[3:48:51.420 --> 3:48:56.860]  these shots that have been so completely polarized and rammed down the throat of americans
[3:48:57.980 --> 3:49:04.540]  and a global community ad nauseam lockstep participation by world leaders it's really
[3:49:04.540 --> 3:49:12.140]  hard to believe that millions of people potentially could be in on this so there are times where i'm
[3:49:12.140 --> 3:49:16.380]  like am i just am i just freaking crazy like seriously have i lost my mind i look in the
[3:49:16.380 --> 3:49:20.700]  mirror like seriously have i lost my mind but then you look at the facts and the statistics
[3:49:20.700 --> 3:49:26.460]  you look at all of these people that truly are dying we talk and we see emails from people who
[3:49:26.460 --> 3:49:31.020]  have had personal experiences i talked to a military barber you can find it at stu peters.tv
[3:49:31.020 --> 3:49:37.740]  she lives right off a military base that's where she cuts hair over a dozen personally known to her
[3:49:38.540 --> 3:49:45.180]  military aged healthy people who continuously go through physical fitness tests and examinations
[3:49:45.180 --> 3:49:53.180]  both physical and psychological dead the only common denominator is this shot there are so many
[3:49:53.180 --> 3:49:57.900]  so many dangers associated with this thing that they are now going to be pushing into five to
[3:49:57.900 --> 3:50:04.140]  eleven year old kids and before the break i mentioned that police will be showing up at my door if i
[3:50:04.140 --> 3:50:11.340]  if i'm hesitant or resistant or refuse outright this injection for my kids because of what i know
[3:50:11.340 --> 3:50:19.420]  to be true and if 340 million people in this country knew what we knew to be true obviously
[3:50:19.420 --> 3:50:22.860]  things would be a whole lot different in this country but it's because of that nick fuente's
[3:50:22.860 --> 3:50:30.460]  type banning it's because of the the info wars alex jones oh and shroyer type banning and me i'm
[3:50:30.460 --> 3:50:37.660]  i'm subject to it as well kicked off twitter kicked off youtube it's because of this that is how
[3:50:37.660 --> 3:50:42.380]  dangerous that is which is why i really wish president trump would have taken that a whole
[3:50:42.380 --> 3:50:47.020]  lot more seriously before he left too but we have to sit and listen to him talk about infrastructure
[3:50:47.020 --> 3:50:51.980]  in the same rallies over and over again but he's getting booed he's getting booed when he talks
[3:50:51.980 --> 3:50:58.220]  about these shots we're watching on saturdays as hundreds of thousands of people erupt at
[3:50:58.220 --> 3:51:04.380]  college football stadiums around the country opposing this installed regime people are waking
[3:51:04.380 --> 3:51:09.500]  up so we have to continue doing this that is why i remain a general in this information war and
[3:51:09.500 --> 3:51:12.940]  we'll continue to do it that's why i know that everybody else on this particular network will
[3:51:12.940 --> 3:51:18.140]  continue to do it and dr jane ruby joins us now who by the way was supposed to have been enjoying
[3:51:18.780 --> 3:51:24.140]  these years retired feet kicked up on the beach in florida you made it to florida you got the
[3:51:24.140 --> 3:51:27.980]  beach in your backyard but the feet aren't kicked up and you're still working harder than ever i
[3:51:27.980 --> 3:51:32.380]  bet you never imagined that you would be a foot soldier in this war and yet here you are you've
[3:51:32.380 --> 3:51:38.300]  been a mainstay on the stu petershow super responsible reporting unrelenting research
[3:51:39.100 --> 3:51:44.620]  and bravery i mean you were the first i believe in the united states to bring graphene oxide to
[3:51:44.620 --> 3:51:48.460]  the public attention it's now widely known and that's the least of our concerns inside of these
[3:51:48.460 --> 3:51:53.020]  injections we are now learning as more and more microscopy experts come forward and the things
[3:51:53.020 --> 3:51:59.180]  that we're seeing under the glass dr kerry midday is bringing us uh dr zandre batha i mean brave
[3:51:59.180 --> 3:52:02.700]  people speaking out saying hey this isn't right and they're banned and they're shut up and they're
[3:52:02.700 --> 3:52:06.940]  shut down and they're called crazy and kooky conspiracy theorists and now they're going to
[3:52:06.940 --> 3:52:11.340]  jab our kids i want to know your real thoughts on what you think is going to happen am i outside of
[3:52:11.340 --> 3:52:16.540]  the line am i overstating or being hyperbolic when i say all you have to do is look at a bunch
[3:52:16.540 --> 3:52:21.980]  of dead babies with pulmonary hemorrhage all you have to do is look at 12 to 17 year old boys who
[3:52:21.980 --> 3:52:28.460]  are you know kicking off keeling off and experiencing serious heart conditions i mean it makes sense
[3:52:28.460 --> 3:52:35.580]  that that would be consistent in the 5 to 11 age group am i wrong no you're 100 right stew and like
[3:52:35.580 --> 3:52:40.380]  i said before the break uh there's a lot more devastation and death to come and it's going to
[3:52:40.380 --> 3:52:46.220]  be greater and in larger numbers because children react more robustly look i want to go back on the
[3:52:46.220 --> 3:52:52.700]  record this is not a vaccine everybody stop calling it that like dr david martin says if you call it
[3:52:52.700 --> 3:52:57.740]  a vaccine you've already lost the argument so let's start there and secondly things are getting
[3:52:57.740 --> 3:53:04.460]  very dangerous people are going you know to their local drug store to get a seasonal flu shot well
[3:53:04.460 --> 3:53:11.420]  guess what they're getting they're getting hit with covid 19 injections from any of these companies
[3:53:11.420 --> 3:53:16.860]  and they're told later on things are dangerous i have called for across my friends my family and
[3:53:16.860 --> 3:53:23.020]  the general public for a 100 percent moratorium right now on all vaccines i i don't want to hear
[3:53:23.020 --> 3:53:28.780]  this thing oh i'm not an anti-vaxxer but well you know what there's no reason to change to trust
[3:53:28.780 --> 3:53:34.140]  these companies right now they've lost the privilege of our faith and trust and we have to suspend
[3:53:34.140 --> 3:53:39.180]  right now until we get to the bottom of this and you're right scientists like that have done a great
[3:53:39.180 --> 3:53:45.180]  job since these companies are not having press conferences they're not disclosing they're withholding
[3:53:45.180 --> 3:53:50.460]  information actively all we can do is put together the world sciences to start doing what they're
[3:53:50.460 --> 3:53:54.540]  doing they're analyzing these vials they're they're chemically analyzing them they're looking at the
[3:53:54.540 --> 3:53:59.740]  blood of people who have been injected and a lot of people have not been injected stew are also
[3:53:59.740 --> 3:54:05.660]  coming up with blood damage and i have a suspicion it's because this mRNA technology and a lot of
[3:54:05.660 --> 3:54:11.980]  these poisons were probably this didn't start like this year it probably was being used and
[3:54:11.980 --> 3:54:17.980]  infiltrated into the into the seasonal flu and other seasonal injections but that's just my
[3:54:17.980 --> 3:54:23.180]  speculation right now look for the kids i i want to do a shout out to president trump
[3:54:23.180 --> 3:54:29.020]  you've got to i agree with dr alexander you've got to come out against this now i don't care how
[3:54:29.020 --> 3:54:34.700]  many bad advisors you've got around you this is this is uh you'd have to be deaf dumb and blind
[3:54:34.700 --> 3:54:40.060]  not to see what's happening and it's about to happen to our children and and it's getting serious
[3:54:40.060 --> 3:54:44.140]  and i'm going to tell you something else stew they're they didn't do their due diligence the fda
[3:54:44.140 --> 3:54:48.860]  did not require the companies to do their due diligence on drug drug interactions but i'll
[3:54:48.860 --> 3:54:53.580]  tell you what they are allowing the company to do there's a study on clinical trials dot gov it's
[3:54:53.580 --> 3:55:01.500]  it's 048 63638 i'm going to tell you this study i just realized today is sponsored that means it's
[3:55:01.500 --> 3:55:09.660]  paid for by the china national biotech group and it's going to test the covet 19 vaccine whatever
[3:55:09.660 --> 3:55:16.780]  that is in 3 to 17 year olds in the united states it started on april 28th of this year and guess
[3:55:16.780 --> 3:55:23.660]  what it it went until may of of of this year i mean that's not even a one month study so the
[3:55:23.660 --> 3:55:30.380]  shenanigans that are going on are just unbelievable the fda is collapsed you have to all take a step
[3:55:30.380 --> 3:55:35.420]  back until we can get to the bottom of this and spare these children this is getting incredibly
[3:55:35.420 --> 3:55:40.860]  dangerous and you're not safe if you go for a regular seasonal shot you don't even know what
[3:55:40.860 --> 3:55:47.100]  you're getting yeah especially when they're being given out at your kid's school i mean by the janitor
[3:55:47.100 --> 3:55:51.980]  or by the lunch aid or whoever it is that's that's giving these shots dr jane ruby thank you so much
[3:55:51.980 --> 3:55:59.180]  for me stew yeah and the testing the swabs very dangerous right now agreeing to the swabs in
[3:55:59.180 --> 3:56:06.060]  place of the jab is still surrender and you're still at risk for getting inoculated with god knows
[3:56:06.060 --> 3:56:12.700]  whatever viruses parasites all kinds of things and and that that evidence is well has been out there
[3:56:12.700 --> 3:56:19.020]  for some time we appreciate you being here dr jane ruby uh you do fantastic work and thank you i
[3:56:19.020 --> 3:56:25.100]  have a great weekend uh you know and dr jane was talking about the fact that fizer and moderna
[3:56:25.100 --> 3:56:30.620]  none of these companies have come forward giving a press conference well who does that remind you
[3:56:30.620 --> 3:56:36.540]  of i mean look at look at this faux administration up in the white house supposedly allegedly
[3:56:36.540 --> 3:56:43.180]  that's where they are uh press conferences questions no i don't know they run away what
[3:56:43.180 --> 3:56:47.100]  does a criminal do when they commit a crime they run away what do they try to do with evidence
[3:56:47.100 --> 3:56:52.300]  they try to conceal it the fact is they don't want to be in front of a camera right now because
[3:56:52.300 --> 3:56:59.260]  inevitably the question is going to be is your drug fda approved and the answer is no it is not
[3:57:00.140 --> 3:57:06.060]  you have been duped everybody who doesn't know know this now call fizer yourself i have done it
[3:57:06.700 --> 3:57:14.380]  there is no covid 19 vaccine approved by the fda available in the united states from any company
[3:57:14.380 --> 3:57:20.140]  anywhere and so everybody taking this military mandate all of you that are at work being told
[3:57:20.140 --> 3:57:25.260]  that it's fda approved and that's why you have to be subjecting yourselves to these shots mandated
[3:57:25.260 --> 3:57:30.700]  to take them as a condition of your employment that is absolutely not true we saw the 180 by
[3:57:30.700 --> 3:57:35.180]  governor ronda santis and now he's holding corporations like that liable if they force
[3:57:35.180 --> 3:57:39.260]  this thing as a condition of employment that's how you govern with balls and i hope trump follows
[3:57:39.260 --> 3:57:43.580]  suit on shroyer is up next please come and find me at stu peters dot tv we'll see you next week
[3:57:43.580 --> 3:57:52.300]  i'm sitting here it's in the early morning hours and i'm looking at mainstream news
[3:57:53.740 --> 3:57:58.860]  reporting on the fact that even the controlled revolving door fda has come out and said that
[3:57:58.860 --> 3:58:04.780]  the moderna and fizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children because he in studies
[3:58:04.780 --> 3:58:08.620]  they did on children it caused myocarditis that's heart swelling and heart attacks
[3:58:08.620 --> 3:58:13.900]  and then i noticed that even though this is even in the associated press it's not getting any
[3:58:13.900 --> 3:58:18.460]  circulation it's not on the national news and it's very hard to even find on places like instagram
[3:58:18.460 --> 3:58:24.620]  or twitter it's just crazy and then fouchy was on tv just yesterday saying there's no damage from
[3:58:24.620 --> 3:58:30.220]  the vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody you're a conspiracy theorist if you say it it's just crazy
[3:58:30.220 --> 3:58:33.740]  and then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out and said these vaccines are
[3:58:33.740 --> 3:58:38.940]  going to cause heart problems they gave the exact reasons why and now it happened that's why info
[3:58:38.940 --> 3:58:43.820]  wars is on air because if we weren't on air they get away with even more of this crap this is just
[3:58:43.820 --> 3:58:50.060]  insane these people are killers it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that
[3:58:50.060 --> 3:58:55.260]  can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different
[3:58:55.260 --> 3:59:00.620]  studies reports about my nasa and other governments other agencies they all disagree on what's really
[3:59:00.620 --> 3:59:07.020]  happening with the climate the only constant the only great truth is change is the only constant
[3:59:07.580 --> 3:59:12.860]  so yes climate change is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the
[3:59:12.860 --> 3:59:16.780]  70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted
[3:59:16.780 --> 3:59:23.020]  to okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[3:59:23.580 --> 3:59:28.220]  when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the
[3:59:28.220 --> 3:59:34.460]  un they have weather control trees from 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a
[3:59:34.460 --> 3:59:39.900]  very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spraying different
[3:59:39.900 --> 3:59:44.380]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real
[3:59:44.380 --> 3:59:55.980]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
