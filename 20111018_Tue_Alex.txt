[00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:09.737]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:12.878]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:17.060]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:28.184]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:30.645]  It is Tuesday, October 18, 2011.
[00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:38.844]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:38.844 --> 00:00:54.641]  Dr. Steve Pchenik will be joining us coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show today to give us more breakdown and analysis on the attempts to take this country to war with Iran and to be able to finish up his comments.
[00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:07.815]  Brought us to the end of the show back on Friday with him dealing with Israel and several other subjects.
[00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:10.478]  So that is coming up today.
[00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:28.354]  Also, as Infowars.com reported, as Reuters even reported yesterday, a major scientific study has proven that Ron Paul is getting the least amount of media coverage and debate time of any of the candidates.
[00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.937]  And he's in number three, undisputed.
[00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:33.841]  And if he was getting fair coverage, he would be number one.
[00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:36.740]  No need to belabor that point.
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.461]  It's on the Drudge Report.
[00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.303]  It's all over national news yesterday and today.
[00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:44.125]  But all of us just watching could see this.
[00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:58.075]  And I know that my researchers at Infowars.com just the last few months have taped the debates and we've written articles showing that Ron Paul gets the least amount of time.
[00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:03.580]  So we don't need a scientific study to show us what's happening.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.824]  And that when he gets questions, they tend to be very, very negative.
[00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:19.173]  Now, when the mainstream dying, pretty much illegitimate mainstream media, illegitimate is not even a word, they are illegitimate by and large.
[00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:28.100]  When the not even pertinent, not even in the game mainstream media does these types of things, they lose more and more credibility.
[00:02:29.443 --> 00:02:32.326]  And that's one of the points that needs to be raised today.
[00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:44.296]  Certainly a lot of mainstream news is just straight-up facts, like a red tide hit the entire Texas coastline in the last two days, or an airplane crashed at such time.
[00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:50.802]  It's when you get into political issues that you see the spin, the deception, the lying by omission.
[00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:52.923]  And that's starting to kill the mainstream media.
[00:02:53.684 --> 00:03:09.869]  I did notice, though, I was pleasantly surprised to see the cover of the New York Times today talking about the Occupy Wall Street people, and it is extremely
[00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.730]  We're good to go.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.484]  We have a Zero Hedge article up at Infowars.com pointing this out again today.
[00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:37.588]  We're not saying the Occupy Wall Street people are bad.
[00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:50.819]  We're saying that the leadership, the people who've claimed that they're the leaders of it, are calling for austerity measures upon the middle class to supposedly transfer the wealth to the poor.
[00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.524]  And I guess that means people that went and got two college degrees and can't find a job because of globalization.
[00:03:57.352 --> 00:04:09.540]  The signs, I've seen countless signs in Austin and New York and around the country saying things, redistribute or else, redistribute or revolution, redistribute or violence.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.765]  There's a new poll out today that shows that one third of the Occupy Wall Street people are saying they want violence or advocate it.
[00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:23.989]  We're seeing different top people at the speaking events calling for violence.
[00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.952]  And there's no mistake this is happening in October.
[00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:30.915]  There's no mistake that George Soros and others are trying to hijack it.
[00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:36.039]  But the New York Times has a photo here that says, Young, Educated and Unemployed.
[00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.402]  Another photo here of Sticks on the front, say Reform Corporate Welfare.
[00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:42.403]  That's a big legitimate issue.
[00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:43.564]  Here's another one, End the Fed.
[00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:47.260]  And it's a fellow with an American flag beside him.
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.761]  This is not meant to make him look bad.
[00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:50.422]  End of the Fed.
[00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:51.403]  Stop the wars.
[00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:54.965]  And then you got an InfoWars listener with an InfoWars.com sticker here.
[00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:56.226]  Another one saying I'm very upset.
[00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:56.626]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:04.674]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.674 --> 00:05:05.575]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:08.998]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:09.858]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:14.762]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:15.502]  It's true.
[00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:20.386]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:21.207]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:24.789]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.472]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:29.493]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.493 --> 00:05:32.255]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:35.939]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:36.720]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.863]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.863 --> 00:05:45.628]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:50.091]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:05:56.736 --> 00:06:07.083]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:12.227]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:12.227 --> 00:06:13.708]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:26.953]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:34.019]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:39.081]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:41.222]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:41.222 --> 00:06:43.022]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:45.903]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:45.903 --> 00:06:52.525]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:58.467]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:07:00.237 --> 00:07:03.899]  You may be arrested and you're subject to other police action.
[00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:05.160]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.103]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.103 --> 00:07:11.324]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:17.188]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:07:17.188 --> 00:07:23.412]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.852 --> 00:07:29.833]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:34.014]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.014 --> 00:07:38.295]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.295 --> 00:07:44.236]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.236 --> 00:07:47.796]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.796 --> 00:07:49.777]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.777 --> 00:07:50.217]  It's here.

[00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.430]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.233]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.807 --> 00:08:21.528]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:21.528 --> 00:08:25.770]  It is, of course, Tuesday, the 18th of October, 2011.
[00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:31.914]  Ron Paul has unveiled his new trillion dollar cut in the budget.
[00:08:31.914 --> 00:08:36.356]  Cuts across the board in welfare, corporate welfare, military expense,
[00:08:37.737 --> 00:08:40.900]  Defense spending, all of it, that's big news.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:51.710]  Now we've got the neocons and the desperate Obamanoids trying to become politically popular again, trying to launch a distractionary war against Iran right now.
[00:08:51.710 --> 00:09:01.278]  That has still got a green light, but more and more people are coming out pointing out that the Iranian assassination plot was completely phony.
[00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:05.560]  That is all unfolding right now.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:17.085]  Obviously, the Federal Reserve of San Antonio requested formally, and last night on the nightly news we showed that YouTube communique notice
[00:09:17.845 --> 00:09:26.554]  That the Federal Reserve had requested that the video where they admit that the Federal Reserve is private be removed.
[00:09:26.554 --> 00:09:33.462]  I left the video up and challenged it and it's before a YouTube review board right now and could be taken down or couldn't be.
[00:09:33.462 --> 00:09:38.847]  No one really knows how these things work but it just shows the Federal Reserve always engaged.
[00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:39.878]  I think?
[00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:19.536]  Uh, at the same time they brought in the income tax that we got, the Federal Reserve, and that all of this is about power grabbing, ending states' rights, ending our republic, and transferring power to a private, global, corporate government that is now in its final moves to bankrupt the entire world.
[00:10:20.781 --> 00:10:31.306]  It's also in the press today that the European Union by next Monday will announce its new massive restructuring.
[00:10:31.306 --> 00:10:38.469]  But they've already told the world it is a private bank of the world based in Europe that the once sovereign nations that
[00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:51.840]  Sign on to the EU will pay their taxes to all these new taxes and that the countries will never be allowed to exit again and that no vote by the people can extricate them.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.846]  It is classical tyranny, classical occupation, but under the rubric of financial occupation.
[00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:00.948]  It is unbelievable tyranny.
[00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:25.084]  But because it doesn't come in the form of soldiers on the street corners with submachine guns and political dissidents being drug off and tanks rolling across your borders and your capital being taken over and a foreign flag being run up because it's not a conquering army like Hitler or Stalin rolling into Eastern Europe or Napoleon before them or William the Conqueror going into England.
[00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:30.728]  Because it's not a classical invasion and takeover, people don't understand how to respond to it.
[00:11:31.648 --> 00:11:34.671]  I liken it to dodo birds.
[00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:44.918]  When western sailors arrived on the island where the dodo birds were, and the dodo birds were completely domesticated and did not fear humans.
[00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:51.283]  And so the sailors could just go conk them on the head and get a good fresh meal out of them.
[00:11:51.283 --> 00:11:55.166]  Of course, people that study nature
[00:11:57.065 --> 00:12:16.694]  Uh, naturalists and others have pointed out, and there's a lot of documentaries about small uninhabited islands that have goats on them that have been, you know, put there hundreds of years before by sailors, or natural deer, or wild pigs, or pickerings, other species, that they're not afraid of humans.
[00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:19.876]  They'll walk right up to you, and you can conk them on the head and eat them.
[00:12:21.428 --> 00:12:24.409]  And generally, it takes a while for them.
[00:12:24.409 --> 00:12:31.732]  You'll walk right over and conk them on the head, or shoot them, or spear them, and others will watch as you eat them.
[00:12:31.732 --> 00:12:38.355]  And generally, one or two get smart and run off, and then they'll produce the new stock.
[00:12:38.355 --> 00:12:48.479]  It's like once animals aren't afraid of you, once they're either domesticated or never been in contact with humans, they're just totally unaware.
[00:12:49.622 --> 00:12:50.923]  And that's what's happening.
[00:12:50.923 --> 00:13:00.608]  Globalism is a modern spin on every form of conquering tyranny this planet's ever seen.
[00:13:00.608 --> 00:13:02.749]  And it's a political domination.
[00:13:02.749 --> 00:13:04.530]  It's a corporate domination.
[00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:15.376]  Now, we've seen by stealth moves of cultural domination by groups, by religions, by ideas that can also happen by semi-stealth.
[00:13:17.153 --> 00:13:30.543]  That's not new, but this corporate creeping Machiavellian system is certainly new in the last hundred years, and that's why people aren't aware of it.
[00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:44.633]  But your taxes, the regulations, how your police dress, what the laws are, what land you can own, what businesses you can operate, what type of things you can sell, carbon taxes.
[00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:54.283]  All run by this new quote financial private union that they're likening to the Marshall Plan.
[00:13:54.283 --> 00:14:01.672]  Well, that was just the West going into Europe, England, the US, the Anglo-American Empire, and simply taking Europe into receivership.
[00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:29.427]  But they still couldn't get rid of the sovereignty itself, so they set up the trade agreements that brought them into the Euro, and already over 80% of their laws, Lord Monckton's correcting me, it's over 70, I'm always saying 70%, it's well over 80% now, or what did he say, 5 out of 6 laws, on record, are just created by private bureaucrats, who were all finance capital bankers,
[00:14:32.742 --> 00:14:37.787]  The opposite of free market.
[00:14:37.787 --> 00:14:41.370]  So that's what we're facing here right now.
[00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:49.919]  Now here's an example of stealth cultural takeover and I'm going to cover a few other news items and give the number out for listeners to call in about.
[00:14:51.812 --> 00:15:04.976]  I spent probably two hours of the three-hour radio show yesterday talking about being down here on the Texas-Mexico border, where the people are now scared of the drug cartels, they're scared of the police.
[00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:06.757]  I've never seen such groveling.
[00:15:06.757 --> 00:15:14.780]  I was about three miles away from the Mexican border two days ago, out on a little charter boat I got for my family to go do some fishing.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:23.042]  And I ended up saying, give me a tour, you know, basically around Padre Island, South Padre Island.
[00:15:23.042 --> 00:15:35.085]  And every time they saw a homeland security boat, an ice boat, a Coast Guard boat, I mean, there was literal stepping and fetching and groveling and bowing down and cutting engines when they even drove by at
[00:15:37.846 --> 00:15:40.207]  300, 400 yards away, and I would say, I've never seen this before.
[00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:45.370]  I've been deep sea fishing and bay fishing all over Texas and other parts of the country.
[00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:52.773]  And they said, yeah, if you don't cut your engines when they come around anywhere, then they board you and get in your face now.
[00:15:52.773 --> 00:16:02.357]  And literally, these men would just drive by in these black uniforms, just bugging their eyes out at a little charter boat with two guys on it.
[00:16:02.357 --> 00:16:05.339]  I mean, it is letting you know you're a slave.
[00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:15.479]  Now, while all of this is going on, Mexico in three years has 40-plus thousand dead, 5,000 dead on this side, so 45,000.
[00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:18.802]  There have been gunfights, gun battles.
[00:16:18.802 --> 00:16:26.889]  Newspapers, TV stations have been threatened here in the Brownsville, McAllen, Kingsville, South Padre area.
[00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:28.551]  They admit they won't report on it now.
[00:16:30.106 --> 00:16:53.789]  And a lot of people, instead of getting angry at the Mexican cartels and mad at the Mexican government and its expansionist aims, which is really funny, you've got a collapsing failed state that for 40 years has taught in the schools that our own State Department is financed and the Ford Foundation as well, we've shown these on air, that the Southwest belongs to Mexico and that it's going to be a racial kingdom for Hispanics.
[00:16:54.389 --> 00:17:04.273]  When Hispanics, whites, blacks are all completely integrating and getting along in business and general life and intermarrying, I mean, but it doesn't matter.
[00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:13.276]  You've got America that's been taught to be anti-national sovereignty, lowering our immune system to foreign powers.
[00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:18.238]  Okay, and cultural assimilation and domination.
[00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:22.740]  They're not assimilating into the Republic, or the free market, or the Second Amendment culture.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.523]  No, Mexico, and this is taught in public, this was taught at Anderson High School.
[00:17:27.523 --> 00:17:32.125]  I went to high school a couple years in Dallas, a couple in Austin.
[00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:42.510]  This was taught, and I'm going to get to the news here in a minute, this was taught here in Austin, Texas, 20 years ago when I was in high school.
[00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:52.150]  And it was taught by my white history teacher and by my white art teacher that America was bad, it belonged to Mexico, and that soon the Southwest would be Oslo.
[00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:55.332]  Because it's all Ford Foundation programming.
[00:17:55.332 --> 00:17:58.695]  And we were taken to UT, the art class, and taught all this stuff.
[00:17:58.695 --> 00:18:00.656]  And I stood up and said, I'm not putting up with this.
[00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:07.440]  You know, Mexico does all these horrible things to immigrants and, you know, and is a kleptocracy.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:14.125]  I got up this morning and saw the monitor, the McAllen monitor, and it says, Spanish class Ryles parents.
[00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:16.066]  And of course, it was Glenn Beck that broke this.
[00:18:16.066 --> 00:18:19.008]  You're not going to see this broken in a local newspaper.
[00:18:19.668 --> 00:18:22.290]  And it goes on to say, Glenn Beck, the father, played the video.
[00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.331]  The school's defending it.
[00:18:23.331 --> 00:18:26.073]  We're going to get this up at InfoWars.com.
[00:18:26.073 --> 00:18:27.755]  TheMonitor.com has the video.
[00:18:27.755 --> 00:18:29.456]  And I'm going to get Kurt in the middle of it.
[00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:31.318]  Let's ask Kurt to post this right now.
[00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:32.939]  Spanish class riles parents.
[00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:34.240]  Then you read it.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.583]  They are taught Mexican history in the Spanish class.
[00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.805]  They're taught America stole all the land.
[00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:41.566]  That's the real issue.
[00:18:41.566 --> 00:18:43.227]  It's Mexican government, Ford Foundation.
[00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:45.789]  Why would the big elite banks, private foundation want this?
[00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:47.111]  It's to break up America.
[00:18:48.224 --> 00:18:50.126]  They're going to wreck Mexico with Divide and Conquer.
[00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:53.009]  They're going to wreck us with it as well.
[00:18:53.009 --> 00:18:59.475]  And it goes on to say that they give the Spanish National Anthem and pledge allegiance to Mexico.
[00:19:00.595 --> 00:19:02.396]  But it goes further, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:02.396 --> 00:19:04.037]  This is taught everywhere.
[00:19:04.037 --> 00:19:05.137]  This is taught in Illinois.
[00:19:05.137 --> 00:19:06.778]  This is taught in New York.
[00:19:06.778 --> 00:19:09.880]  If your class is 20% Spanish-speaking, it's taught.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.322]  And I've seen a lot of Puerto Ricans and others that have shot video that are offended by it.
[00:19:13.322 --> 00:19:16.564]  They're like, number one, I'm from Brazil, or I'm from Puerto Rico.
[00:19:16.564 --> 00:19:17.464]  I'm not Mexican.
[00:19:17.464 --> 00:19:19.925]  But when you take a Spanish class now, you're taught.
[00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.366]  You are now a Mexican.
[00:19:21.366 --> 00:19:23.007]  This is Mexico.
[00:19:23.007 --> 00:19:26.109]  It's because Mexico is one of the most nationalistic
[00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:30.210]  Countries in the world, which I'm not saying that's a bad thing at the end of the day.
[00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.871]  America used to be like that.
[00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:35.732]  America's, you know, very macho, but so is Mexico.
[00:19:35.732 --> 00:19:41.313]  And now America's been taught, well, you've seen it all over the country, where you can't wear an American flag on your old Navy shirt.
[00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.394]  Hispanic kids can't in San Francisco.
[00:19:43.394 --> 00:19:44.635]  They're kicked out.
[00:19:44.635 --> 00:19:51.157]  You've seen the American flags torn down at post offices and private businesses and Mexican flags run up and the American flags stomped on.
[00:19:51.157 --> 00:19:53.737]  Because it's taught in the schools.
[00:19:53.737 --> 00:19:55.218]  We'll be right back with more of this report.
[00:19:55.218 --> 00:19:55.618]  Stay with us.

[00:20:30.217 --> 00:20:31.458]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:36.021]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.021 --> 00:20:41.825]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:45.467]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:45.467 --> 00:20:48.289]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:53.232]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.232 --> 00:20:53.493]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.493 --> 00:20:54.894]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.277 --> 00:21:06.121]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:09.343]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.

[00:21:57.134 --> 00:22:00.015]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[00:22:00.015 --> 00:22:04.577]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:22:04.577 --> 00:22:08.919]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:14.282]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:22:14.642 --> 00:22:15.403]  It's true.
[00:22:15.403 --> 00:22:21.086]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:22:21.086 --> 00:22:24.689]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:22:24.689 --> 00:22:29.391]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:32.153]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:22:32.153 --> 00:22:35.495]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:22:36.616 --> 00:22:40.760]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:45.824]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:22:45.824 --> 00:22:49.988]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:49.988 --> 00:22:51.789]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:54.031]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:22:54.031 --> 00:22:56.393]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:23:00.848 --> 00:23:06.551]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:10.733]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[00:23:10.733 --> 00:23:16.475]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[00:23:16.475 --> 00:23:22.098]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[00:23:22.438 --> 00:23:29.005]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[00:23:29.005 --> 00:23:36.733]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[00:23:36.733 --> 00:23:45.542]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they realize the need for long-term storable vitamins.
[00:23:45.942 --> 00:23:52.312]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method, which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[00:23:52.312 --> 00:23:55.497]  Again, go to survivalrx.com.
[00:23:55.497 --> 00:23:57.180]  That's survivalrx.com.
[00:24:10.728 --> 00:24:20.540]  We've got a lot of breaking news today that is new news to new listeners, but not to our long-time faithful listeners that understand we know what we're talking about.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:27.870]  I've written the articles, I have covered it, I've had the inside guest on, and Fox News today
[00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:47.535]  Had Daryl Issa on, and the article is at Fox News, we're going to get it linked up at Infowars.com, but I also want to get Watson to write a more detailed article pointing to our older articles that pointed all this out, that Bush was involved in Operation Gunrunner.
[00:24:47.535 --> 00:24:56.457]  It just was not called Fast and Furious, and the Bush administration was then not using it to go after the Second Amendment.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.722]  They were just shipping guns.
[00:25:00.722 --> 00:25:01.642]  This is now confirmed.
[00:25:01.642 --> 00:25:07.145]  We're going to put it on screen for you if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:25:07.145 --> 00:25:11.308]  This is now confirmed, but we already knew it.
[00:25:11.308 --> 00:25:20.513]  Just like I already told you years ago that when I went to public school, and I've confirmed it across the country, they teach that the Southwest is Mexico and white people are evil.
[00:25:21.448 --> 00:25:29.335]  That's only done so the globalists can break up the United States and play his Hispanic stuff against whites.
[00:25:29.335 --> 00:25:31.918]  They do not want us recognizing the real enemy, the globalists.
[00:25:31.918 --> 00:25:34.020]  I mean, it's very elementary.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:40.005]  Just like the globalists are balkanizing Mexico by financing all the major cartels to kill each other.
[00:25:40.005 --> 00:25:46.231]  It's come out that the ATF has shipped guns to Sinaloa, Los Zetas, the cartel as it's called,
[00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:48.953]  And other subgroups.
[00:25:48.953 --> 00:25:50.534]  They shipped them the guns directly.
[00:25:50.534 --> 00:25:56.959]  They only had a few gun-walking programs on video with their own agents as well to demonize the Second Amendment.
[00:25:56.959 --> 00:26:03.264]  That, as I said yesterday, is the raw meat to the lions, as a Colonel Schaefer would put it.
[00:26:03.264 --> 00:26:04.725]  Or I likened it yesterday...
[00:26:05.706 --> 00:26:11.891]  On the nightly news, that I did via Skype last night with Aaron Dykes, to a mockingbird.
[00:26:11.891 --> 00:26:15.253]  If you don't live around the state bird of Texas, most states have mockingbirds.
[00:26:15.253 --> 00:26:25.341]  They'll build nests in low bushes or small trees, and if you get anywhere near it when you're mowing the yard or watering plants or fixing something, they'll flop around the ground, act like their wing is broken.
[00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:27.722]  They ought to win Academy Awards.
[00:26:27.722 --> 00:26:31.745]  And they don't want you getting near their babies that have hatched or near their eggs.
[00:26:32.697 --> 00:26:32.897]  I think?
[00:26:51.161 --> 00:26:54.725]  They were allowing drugs to be shipped in and they were shipping guns out.
[00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:55.947]  That's always been going on.
[00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:57.628]  This is just Iran-Contra.
[00:26:57.628 --> 00:26:59.931]  Again, Iran-Contra wasn't new.
[00:26:59.931 --> 00:27:01.913]  Fast and Furious isn't new.
[00:27:01.913 --> 00:27:12.185]  It's just a new name because Obama was going to also then try to blame it on the Second Amendment when it was a globalist destabilization program in Mexico.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.643]  And so there's Daryl Issa on Fox News going, Bush was involved.
[00:27:17.643 --> 00:27:23.527]  He noticed I'm the only one that's been saying for months, Daryl Issa can't go after Obama.
[00:27:23.527 --> 00:27:29.291]  That's why he came out and said, look, Holder, Attorney General, I know you perjured yourself.
[00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:32.934]  Say it was a mistake or we're going to have to move to indict your butt.
[00:27:34.124 --> 00:27:36.565]  This is what you gotta come in, you gotta come in and say it was a mistake.
[00:27:36.565 --> 00:27:38.826]  People said, why is he giving him that out?
[00:27:38.826 --> 00:27:41.207]  Because it will bring down the entire system.
[00:27:41.207 --> 00:27:43.088]  Who do you think runs America?
[00:27:43.088 --> 00:27:47.710]  Six megabanks that openly launder and run the drug money.
[00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:55.233]  They run the aircraft, they've been caught from pillar to post, from beginning to end, in the entire chain.
[00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:59.162]  In the entire control system.
[00:27:59.162 --> 00:28:00.483]  And we're trying to dig up the video.
[00:28:00.483 --> 00:28:08.306]  Rob saw it this morning and found the Fox News article, but we're trying to dig up the video on YouTube so we can have it tonight on the nightly news or maybe even on the show later today.
[00:28:08.306 --> 00:28:12.088]  With this Fox News saying this goes back to Bush.
[00:28:12.088 --> 00:28:15.389]  And now you're going to see a lot of Republicans go, well, you can't blame Bush.
[00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:16.910]  Here's my guns.
[00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:25.334]  Just like they like Mitt Romney, who's for gun control, abortion, carbon taxes, supports John P. Holdren, wrote the Obamacare healthcare.
[00:28:27.121 --> 00:28:30.645]  Republicans don't care about saving America.
[00:28:30.645 --> 00:28:33.047]  That is mainline country club Republicans.
[00:28:33.047 --> 00:28:38.974]  They care about feeling like they're part of the power structure while they get gang raped by the New World Order.
[00:28:38.974 --> 00:28:42.417]  They live in a delusional land like lobotomized monkeys.
[00:28:43.795 --> 00:28:45.036]  Same thing with Democrats.
[00:28:45.036 --> 00:28:52.419]  They don't care if Obama's torturing, launching wars, is a warlord attacking Africa, as we predicted three years ago in Obama Deception.
[00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:56.500]  As long as they get to feel like they're winners and put his bumper sticker on.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.141]  It's like a Cowboys fan.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.781]  I was talking to a guy yesterday who's a big football fan.
[00:29:02.781 --> 00:29:08.184]  He was telling me all the famous football players he knows and how he's got all these signed helmets and how it's his whole life to him.
[00:29:08.184 --> 00:29:14.267]  I couldn't even bring it to him saying, you're like a child, sir, who's been given all these fake wars and fake tribes to love.
[00:29:14.267 --> 00:29:23.252]  There's a reason you love it so much because it's what you would have been as a man, warring for liberty and freedom in the infowar and physically if need be.
[00:29:23.252 --> 00:29:27.814]  As the founders said, even if you're aware of everything and fight for liberty, you probably can't keep it.
[00:29:29.261 --> 00:29:33.183]  But we're a nation of naive men and women.
[00:29:33.183 --> 00:29:41.127]  Now, I just distracted off myself into this whole Daryl Issa thing, because that's breaking, and there's just so much coming in, but we'll cover that more.
[00:29:41.127 --> 00:29:44.008]  But this, in fact, I'm going to talk about it more later.
[00:29:44.008 --> 00:29:46.689]  I'm going to talk about Fast and Furious, the bottom of the next hour.
[00:29:46.689 --> 00:29:50.131]  I want to get into the Mexican Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:29:50.131 --> 00:29:51.111]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.111 --> 00:29:53.653]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.653 --> 00:29:56.314]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.362 --> 00:30:02.885]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:30:02.885 --> 00:30:15.158]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[00:30:15.158 --> 00:30:22.346]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[00:30:22.526 --> 00:30:26.647]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:30:26.647 --> 00:30:28.987]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[00:30:28.987 --> 00:30:34.028]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.

[00:30:52.432 --> 00:30:53.173]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:53.173 --> 00:30:58.277]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:58.277 --> 00:31:01.780]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:10.987 --> 00:31:16.371]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.371 --> 00:31:19.413]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:19.413 --> 00:31:21.734]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:27.998]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:27.998 --> 00:31:31.360]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:37.144]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.144 --> 00:31:38.805]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:38.805 --> 00:31:39.926]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:42.747]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:42.747 --> 00:31:46.968]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:46.968 --> 00:31:51.589]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:51.589 --> 00:31:54.190]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.190]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.810]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:01.351 --> 00:32:06.032]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:32:06.032 --> 00:32:12.474]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:32:12.474 --> 00:32:14.734]  Number one, study the past.
[00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:17.135]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:20.856]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.081]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:32:25.081 --> 00:32:28.921]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:32:28.921 --> 00:32:33.963]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:32:33.963 --> 00:32:37.963]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:32:37.963 --> 00:32:41.384]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:32:41.384 --> 00:32:45.265]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:45.865 --> 00:32:50.814]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:32:50.814 --> 00:32:55.442]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:55.442 --> 00:32:58.127]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:19.554]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And Tom keeps a-draggin' on
[00:33:23.207 --> 00:33:30.111]  Yeah, I'm down here on the Texas-Mexico border, just a stone's throw from the border.
[00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:42.378]  I can see Mexico out my window here, and I've been investigating the takeover of the United States by the drug cartels, backed by the CIA.
[00:33:42.378 --> 00:33:50.922]  They are now recruiting our school children, and then the rival drug dealers will be put in the private prisons.
[00:33:50.922 --> 00:33:52.063]  It is so diabolical.
[00:33:53.174 --> 00:33:55.421]  It's how the British took down China.
[00:33:56.909 --> 00:34:09.334]  The Chinese made drugs illegal, made opium illegal, and the British went in and just a few generations were able to buy off all of the local stabulary, corrupt them, make giant profits because it was illegal.
[00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:20.179]  China that didn't know thieves breaking into houses for goods suddenly had the equivalent of thieves today breaking into your house for your computer, your stereo, your jewelry, to buy the overpriced product.
[00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.699]  It is a tax.
[00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:25.661]  The entire drug war is a tax to the megabanks, to the globalists.
[00:34:26.141 --> 00:34:27.763]  It's their unofficial tax.
[00:34:27.763 --> 00:34:31.226]  Now they're moving on to carbon taxes for all human activity.
[00:34:31.226 --> 00:34:39.933]  They're moving on to VAT and sales taxes to pay off what we owe, as Herman Cain, Bill O'Reilly, and Glenn Beck and the rest of them say, when we don't even owe this money.
[00:34:39.933 --> 00:34:42.756]  And it's impossible to pay back the derivatives.
[00:34:42.756 --> 00:34:44.738]  But the public's going to find out.
[00:34:44.738 --> 00:34:46.980]  Now, here's some good news I want to get into.
[00:34:48.502 --> 00:34:57.653]  After getting the bad news, the New York Times cover today is actually honest and admits that Occupy Wall Street's extremely diverse.
[00:34:57.653 --> 00:35:01.177]  You've got George Soros and the Democrats speaking as if they lead it.
[00:35:01.177 --> 00:35:04.581]  But even the establishment New York Times, they just got a new editor there a month ago.
[00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:12.300]  Suddenly they're coming out saying it's a hoax, that Iran was behind this attack, or this planned attack last week.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:17.542]  And they've got an article here basically saying it's very diverse and across the board.
[00:35:17.542 --> 00:35:28.428]  And they've got in the Fed on the front, and talking about the Federal Reserve and people being mad at it, they've got an Alex Jones listener wearing the Obama Joker shirt that we sold.
[00:35:28.428 --> 00:35:31.789]  And on the back of his guitar is a sign.
[00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:32.290]  He says,
[00:35:34.438 --> 00:35:39.259]  9-1-1 was an inside job, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:39.259 --> 00:35:42.680]  And he's got another one of my stickers, Don't Tread on Me, Live Free or Die.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:50.722]  I don't know if you can see this over the Skype with me here on the road, but there it is right there.
[00:35:50.722 --> 00:35:59.224]  You've got the In the Fed, and you've got a corporate welfare one here that says Reform Corporate Welfare, and
[00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:07.382]  Says countless grievances, one thread we're angry.
[00:36:07.382 --> 00:36:10.785]  And it says they're tired of the bailouts, they're tired of the banksters.
[00:36:10.785 --> 00:36:15.548]  Could it be the New York Times actually wants to survive?
[00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:17.510]  Could it be they actually want to tell a little bit of the truth?
[00:36:19.824 --> 00:36:20.785]  About a 90 degree turn?
[00:36:42.003 --> 00:36:44.184]  So that's interesting right there.
[00:36:44.184 --> 00:36:45.304]  I said I'd get to it in a minute there.
[00:36:45.304 --> 00:36:46.124]  I just covered it there.
[00:36:46.124 --> 00:36:47.384]  Maybe I'll read some of that later.
[00:36:47.384 --> 00:36:54.666]  But when I get on the road, I tend to actually just buy newspapers, because all day I'm reading Infowars.com.
[00:36:54.666 --> 00:37:00.027]  And we actually brought a printer, but my wife has expropriated it for the homeschool teaching.
[00:37:00.027 --> 00:37:01.908]  Richard, we need to buy a little printer.
[00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:06.591]  So, because it's impossible for me to surf over here.
[00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:08.913]  Just remind me next week, or this week, we have the crew by it.
[00:37:08.913 --> 00:37:13.477]  Some little, you know, highly rated compact printer, so I can just print all these articles.
[00:37:13.477 --> 00:37:20.483]  Because, you know, now I'm trying to find the whole ISSA headline, where I'm paraphrasing, and I had it on screen earlier.
[00:37:20.483 --> 00:37:26.929]  It was, you know, ISSA acknowledges previous gun stings under Bush, similar to Fast and Furious.
[00:37:28.427 --> 00:37:30.407]  In fact, we could just have Jaron come on air.
[00:37:30.407 --> 00:37:35.489]  I don't even think we have our producers hooked up with their mics where they can go on air, even though I've requested that.
[00:37:35.489 --> 00:37:36.929]  And they can actually read you the headline.
[00:37:36.929 --> 00:37:39.330]  But the point is, it's out there.
[00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.090]  We're getting it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.731]  And I told you this was going on under Bush.
[00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:45.031]  Why?
[00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:50.212]  Because Paul Watson in February, listeners, we read our email.
[00:37:50.212 --> 00:37:52.713]  It's you, the listeners, that are our intelligence network out there.
[00:37:56.767 --> 00:38:13.072]  You, it's hard to talk, I'm watching an incredible squall come in into South Padre and it is just sea foam green with black waves where the clouds are and I'm watching a big squall move like a little tornado.
[00:38:15.791 --> 00:38:16.672]  Over the water?
[00:38:16.672 --> 00:38:17.873]  Wow!
[00:38:17.873 --> 00:38:20.415]  Man, I bet you're gonna see a bunch of surfers show up.
[00:38:20.415 --> 00:38:22.697]  Except it's a red tide with dead fish everywhere.
[00:38:22.697 --> 00:38:25.719]  You go outside, it smells like Armageddon, like death.
[00:38:25.719 --> 00:38:32.004]  There's just giant dead fish and millions of minnows everywhere, and little fish everywhere, and the birds are falling dead.
[00:38:32.004 --> 00:38:33.886]  That's in the newspaper today.
[00:38:33.886 --> 00:38:36.848]  Disoriented birds falling from sky.
[00:38:36.848 --> 00:38:38.229]  It's like end of the world.
[00:38:38.229 --> 00:38:42.092]  Next door, there's this big skyscraper hotel to where I'm staying.
[00:38:42.092 --> 00:38:43.693]  And every time I go outside,
[00:38:44.674 --> 00:38:47.578]  About half the time I go outside, there are hawks spinning.
[00:38:47.578 --> 00:38:48.198]  And I looked it up.
[00:38:48.198 --> 00:38:49.280]  It's not their mating season.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.282]  They're fighting over territory.
[00:38:51.282 --> 00:38:59.192]  And there's hawks clawing each other and falling hundreds of feet down and then disengaging before the ground.
[00:39:00.533 --> 00:39:08.898]  Of course, the camera I brought was in the Fed last Sunday and got rained on and is broken.
[00:39:08.898 --> 00:39:12.281]  I didn't know until we got here that it doesn't really work now.
[00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:14.302]  It keeps switching in and out.
[00:39:14.302 --> 00:39:15.202]  I've tried to dry it out.
[00:39:16.363 --> 00:39:27.234]  Before I go out of town next weekend, I'm going on a mission next weekend, and I need to tell the procurement arm of InfoWars to buy me one more of those little new little Sonys I love that shoot to high death that are small.
[00:39:27.234 --> 00:39:28.315]  I forget the name of them.
[00:39:28.315 --> 00:39:32.299]  We got to put this one in the shop, but these cameras are so good.
[00:39:32.299 --> 00:39:33.380]  We've got to have more of them.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.823]  They're only like 700 bucks, and they've got the power of a $50,000 camera.
[00:39:38.514 --> 00:39:47.628]  It's just like those $3,000 Canon cameras people started using that we started using that shoot stuff that looks like 35mm Hollywood quality.
[00:39:47.628 --> 00:39:48.589]  And now it's a $700.
[00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.970]  Sony does that.
[00:39:50.714 --> 00:39:56.237]  The problem is they warn you not to get sand or water in them.
[00:39:56.237 --> 00:39:58.679]  It's a direct sensor, just like the human eye.
[00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:02.161]  It doesn't go through a refracting mirror onto a sensor.
[00:40:02.161 --> 00:40:09.705]  It's got a huge sensor, as big as the sensors in the Canon still cameras that shoot the best video.
[00:40:09.705 --> 00:40:11.226]  And now they're coming out with even more of these.
[00:40:11.226 --> 00:40:12.247]  It's just amazing.
[00:40:13.027 --> 00:40:24.911]  With one of these little cameras, with a microphone you can hook into it to get better sound, you can do what cost, listen to me carefully, about $100,000 just five years ago.
[00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:26.451]  $700.
[00:40:26.451 --> 00:40:31.433]  That is what is going to equalize the mainstream media with the alternative media.
[00:40:31.433 --> 00:40:32.913]  That's the level playing field.
[00:40:32.913 --> 00:40:36.634]  That's what's scaring the system so bad.
[00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:42.396]  But, when you're in the pouring rain for three hours, umbrellas aren't going to save a camera.
[00:40:44.505 --> 00:40:53.937]  Uh, so I guess we'd have the procurement guys, to use a military term, uh, get one of those and also try to get some little, little, uh, little outfit for it.
[00:40:53.937 --> 00:40:56.060]  Uh, little weatherization package.
[00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:02.304]  I know we almost broke one of the big cannons out there in the rain.
[00:41:02.304 --> 00:41:05.645]  And we had it in a winterized little thing.
[00:41:05.645 --> 00:41:08.206]  You see, I am now absolutely digressing.
[00:41:08.206 --> 00:41:10.566]  Because this is the kind of stuff I'd be doing during the breaks.
[00:41:10.566 --> 00:41:12.867]  If I was in the office, I'd be like, my camera's broken.
[00:41:12.867 --> 00:41:13.927]  Send it to the repair shop.
[00:41:13.927 --> 00:41:15.388]  If they can't fix it, get me another one.
[00:41:15.388 --> 00:41:16.268]  Here, let's do this.
[00:41:16.268 --> 00:41:17.108]  Oh, what's going on?
[00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:18.449]  All right.
[00:41:18.449 --> 00:41:20.349]  Order more Tapa Chico for the refrigerator.
[00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:21.089]  Excellent.
[00:41:21.089 --> 00:41:23.010]  You know, that's the type of stuff that would normally be going on.
[00:41:26.169 --> 00:41:28.950]  You know, I'm procrastinating getting to this next news item.
[00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:50.178]  I'm going to hit this news item, then I'm going to give the number out and take your calls at the bottom of the next hour, and then I will summon my intellect, because it is feeble, and try to give you a full-spectrum analysis of Fashion Furious, the literal black arrow that could shoot down the dragon smog, to use a Hobbit analogy.
[00:41:51.857 --> 00:41:56.643]  Black Arrow, you have never failed my family in five generations.
[00:41:56.643 --> 00:41:59.526]  Now, I send you forth on your final mission.
[00:41:59.526 --> 00:42:01.408]  I don't remember exactly what they say.
[00:42:01.408 --> 00:42:02.930]  The point is, is that, uh...
[00:42:04.951 --> 00:42:10.354]  This is the black arrow that can shoot right into the dragon's belly and take it down, if we use it.
[00:42:10.354 --> 00:42:16.598]  But they're not going to want to use it, as I keep telling you, because Obama didn't do this.
[00:42:16.598 --> 00:42:30.266]  He added the cherry on top, the little goody that I talked about a few weeks ago in that rant, the best bite, the sop in the gravy.
[00:42:30.266 --> 00:42:33.748]  When he used it against the Second Amendment and added another layer on it,
[00:42:35.413 --> 00:42:39.276]  And so, insiders blew the whistle.
[00:42:39.276 --> 00:42:40.878]  That's what happened.
[00:42:40.878 --> 00:42:48.904]  And it got so prolific and so ridiculous when ATF was ordered to deliver the drugs to the drug cartels in 18 Wheelers.
[00:42:48.904 --> 00:42:56.270]  And we're told, don't worry, we have a cover story, that they had fistfights, it's now been reported, people turning over chairs.
[00:42:56.270 --> 00:43:03.736]  I mean, it's gotten so criminal inside the ATF that it's broken into the other compartmentalized area of the white hat guys.
[00:43:04.136 --> 00:43:14.146]  Who are always the people, you know, in the lower room, the porch government agents, like the porch masons, who aren't in the inner party.
[00:43:14.146 --> 00:43:21.593]  Kind of a Winston Smith and Orwellville, who's in the outer party, and then you've got the inner party that O'Brien's in.
[00:43:21.593 --> 00:43:25.838]  That's actually how mafia organizations set themselves up throughout history.
[00:43:28.064 --> 00:43:37.330]  So, that's what's happening here, that's what's going on, and I'll be breaking that down at the bottom of the next hour and getting into the war news, the fellow reserve news and more.
[00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:44.114]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 on any of the issues I've covered in the last few days or any items or news issues you'd like to raise.
[00:43:53.951 --> 00:44:08.824]  Getting back to this little gem, this would never have been in the McAllen monitor, because I've seen this myself literally hundreds of times, if talk radio hadn't covered it.
[00:44:08.824 --> 00:44:13.949]  Libertarian constitutional radio, or at least something advertising itself as that.
[00:44:15.495 --> 00:44:19.158]  I can't tell you how many times we've seen it where we break national stories.
[00:44:19.158 --> 00:44:20.699]  Most of the time we don't even get credit.
[00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:22.020]  Fine, I don't care.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.581]  As long as it gets out there.
[00:44:23.581 --> 00:44:27.925]  And in this case, this is going on in every school district in America.
[00:44:29.272 --> 00:44:33.895]  And it's not just Hispanics that think of themselves as Mexicans, not Americans that are teaching it.
[00:44:33.895 --> 00:44:35.916]  It is gringos that are teaching it.
[00:44:35.916 --> 00:44:45.481]  It's Ford Foundation, fake liberal ideology, by the biggest banks and corporations in this country, financing people at each other's throats.
[00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:49.884]  The last thing they want is Mexicans to take on part of the American culture.
[00:44:49.884 --> 00:44:54.707]  Can you imagine 1776, slapped on the back of the, you know,
[00:44:55.567 --> 00:45:03.616]  Hard work and tough, you know, male-driven hombre idea that is old classical Mexico.
[00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:06.098]  Got a lot of admirable things there.
[00:45:06.098 --> 00:45:09.722]  You think they want 1776 running through that blood?
[00:45:09.722 --> 00:45:11.084]  You think they want that idea?
[00:45:12.588 --> 00:45:19.074]  By the way, being down here, I've seen all the, they had a big Mexican bike rally down here along with a big general bike rally.
[00:45:19.074 --> 00:45:24.499]  And I noticed that the white guys from their bike rally has had a bunch of, you know, rallies out here at the same time.
[00:45:24.499 --> 00:45:29.423]  We're all wearing like KISS shirts and heavy metal shirts, even the older men trying to act trendy.
[00:45:29.423 --> 00:45:33.087]  Most of the Mexicans were actually wearing red, white, and blue and American Eagles.
[00:45:33.087 --> 00:45:38.252]  And see, those are folks that understand that's a good thing compared to everything else that's out there.
[00:45:38.852 --> 00:45:41.796]  And that's a good culture to buy into.
[00:45:41.796 --> 00:45:44.260]  It's an idea of liberty and freedom.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.224]  Now, the system doesn't want that.
[00:45:47.224 --> 00:45:49.847]  They don't want Hispanics buying into 1776.
[00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:53.412]  Like, I'll tell you how to end the corruption down in Mexico.
[00:45:53.412 --> 00:45:55.034]  If everybody was armed down there,
[00:45:56.098 --> 00:45:58.980]  They wouldn't have this culture of corruption grow up.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:11.309]  And if everybody was armed down there, you wouldn't have cartels that come to the door of people and just randomly kill them because they're running their own business or because they won't be conscripts to work for the cartel.
[00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:19.235]  If every person in Mexico had a gun, which the general public doesn't, and used it, this would end overnight.
[00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:20.136]  That's why you've seen the
[00:46:24.383 --> 00:46:39.153]  Classic mafia operating in places like Chicago, New York, Detroit, where there were generally new wave immigrant populations the last, you know, going back a hundred years ago, who'd come from countries where they were controlled by local mafias.
[00:46:39.153 --> 00:46:41.154]  And so it was just business as usual.
[00:46:41.154 --> 00:46:44.677]  You did not have a lot of mafia type good old boy stuff.
[00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:49.880]  You've seen a lot of famous Western movies where the bad sheriff takes over and the town folks overthrow him.
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.202]  Those are based on hundreds of real stories.
[00:46:52.202 --> 00:46:53.663]  They call them brush fire rebellions.
[00:46:54.623 --> 00:46:59.464]  And a lot of times establishment types, the railroad, others would come and kill somebody for their land.
[00:46:59.464 --> 00:47:06.565]  And people, you know, the general folks that had fought the British and come over here to get away from tyranny, they just started killing people.
[00:47:06.565 --> 00:47:10.146]  That's the 1776.
[00:47:10.146 --> 00:47:11.526]  We're not bowing down.
[00:47:11.526 --> 00:47:12.526]  We're not licking your boots.
[00:47:12.526 --> 00:47:15.447]  The police, very polite.
[00:47:15.447 --> 00:47:18.328]  You know, everybody knew what this country was about.
[00:47:18.328 --> 00:47:20.288]  Not perfect, but compared to everybody else, the best.
[00:47:21.337 --> 00:47:23.398]  That is the last thing.
[00:47:23.398 --> 00:47:26.859]  They don't want Mexicans coming over here and becoming Americans.
[00:47:26.859 --> 00:47:27.820]  They don't want that.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.001]  They don't want them adopting red, white, and blue.
[00:47:30.001 --> 00:47:32.202]  Guns, freedom, private property.
[00:47:32.202 --> 00:47:38.865]  Something that Hispanics of cultures I've seen out there absolutely gravitate towards and want.
[00:47:38.865 --> 00:47:39.525]  No, no, no.
[00:47:39.525 --> 00:47:41.746]  They're not going to let that marriage made in heaven happen.
[00:47:42.406 --> 00:47:43.807]  They're not going to let that happen.
[00:47:43.807 --> 00:47:48.990]  So they cram and ram La Reconquista Mecha Raza junk.
[00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:51.992]  You don't ever hear them saying whites can have a college fund or something.
[00:47:51.992 --> 00:47:52.712]  No, no, no.
[00:47:52.712 --> 00:47:57.495]  It's only quote minorities to keep them in a group under the globalist control on their plantation.
[00:47:58.772 --> 00:48:05.416]  And the drug cartels are all about Mecha, La Raza, you know, the group, the race is what the Raza means.
[00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:11.159]  And radio stations called La Infasora, the invasion, La Reconquista, the reconquering.
[00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:12.160]  This is what's taught.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:17.243]  This is what I was taught at Anderson High in two classes by white people.
[00:48:17.243 --> 00:48:19.224]  Old Ford Foundation funded it later came out.
[00:48:20.086 --> 00:48:24.750]  And that's why it's now in the McAllen Monitor.
[00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:25.711]  Never would have been there.
[00:48:25.711 --> 00:48:27.692]  Local news all knows about this.
[00:48:27.692 --> 00:48:34.018]  You can go to any Spanish class in this country that I've seen and it's being taught because it's the curriculum.
[00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:37.732]  It's the curriculum by the big banks.
[00:48:37.732 --> 00:48:38.692]  This is what they want.
[00:48:38.692 --> 00:48:40.393]  They want us at each other's throats.
[00:48:40.393 --> 00:48:51.016]  I mean, endorsing what is known now as the, quote, Mexican culture, corruption, drugs, people groveling, destruction of freedom, humans used as slaves, forced off their land.
[00:48:51.016 --> 00:48:52.116]  This is what we're told.
[00:48:52.116 --> 00:48:53.697]  This is what's taught in schools.
[00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:55.658]  It says there's video of it.
[00:48:55.658 --> 00:48:58.198]  They give the Mexican anthem, national anthem.
[00:48:58.198 --> 00:48:59.639]  They pledge allegiance to Mexico.
[00:49:00.925 --> 00:49:07.967]  They're taught Mexican history, they're taught about the La Reconquista, and about the evil gringo.
[00:49:07.967 --> 00:49:13.829]  Now, that's what's taught in America, and here it is in the newspaper, now that it's a national story.
[00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:19.691]  It says here, it says now, that because it's a national news story, it's being covered.
[00:49:19.691 --> 00:49:22.531]  Spanish class is Ryle's parent.
[00:49:22.531 --> 00:49:24.832]  What about Spanish class is treason?
[00:49:24.832 --> 00:49:25.992]  It is!
[00:49:25.992 --> 00:49:27.513]  Coming and saying, overthrow this government.
[00:49:29.352 --> 00:49:31.538]  I mean, my wife lived in Spain for six years, folks.
[00:49:31.538 --> 00:49:35.128]  She speaks fluent Spanish and reads it on the, uh...
[00:49:37.096 --> 00:49:39.457]  Little Mexican grocery stores, the bodegas.
[00:49:39.457 --> 00:49:40.578]  She'll be driving in the countryside.
[00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:41.738]  She's like, what is that?
[00:49:41.738 --> 00:49:42.639]  What is this?
[00:49:42.639 --> 00:49:49.042]  Sometimes she will listen to the Mexican radio in Austin and it's all these jokes because it's in another language.
[00:49:49.042 --> 00:49:51.583]  So people that speak English don't know this is going on.
[00:49:51.583 --> 00:50:00.027]  It's a perfect way to try to turn Hispanics into a giant Ku Klux Klan group against white people and divide the country, which is what the globalists want.
[00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:07.733]  Here it is, the school says there was nothing wrong with having students recite Mexican Pledge of Allegiance and Anthem.
[00:50:07.733 --> 00:50:14.957]  An assignment for a high school Spanish class that made students recite the Mexican Pledge of Allegiance and National Anthem has upset a parent.
[00:50:14.957 --> 00:50:21.780]  I don't see a connection between all this Mexican history and the Allegiance and the National Anthem.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.781]  And learning Spanish said William E.
[00:50:25.615 --> 00:50:30.459]  Brinson said an interview with conservative radio host Glenn Beck yesterday.
[00:50:30.459 --> 00:50:45.453]  I find it appalling the indoctrination that is going on down here to the 47-year-old truck driver who was instructed his 15-year-old daughter to take a video recording of the exercise at McAllen's Early College High School.
[00:50:47.287 --> 00:50:48.911]  Alright, I'll finish up with this when we get back.
[00:50:48.911 --> 00:50:51.336]  And folks, this is what's being taught.
[00:50:51.336 --> 00:50:52.919]  This is what's being taught.
[00:50:52.919 --> 00:50:55.024]  And everybody's under fear of the drug gangs here.
[00:50:55.888 --> 00:50:58.209]  And the Mexican military operates here with impunity.
[00:50:58.209 --> 00:50:59.109]  This is globalism.
[00:50:59.109 --> 00:51:00.770]  This is the end of all sovereignty.
[00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:05.952]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:53:02.001 --> 00:53:05.863]  From the shattered Rust Belt come the Lost Vegas.
[00:53:18.392 --> 00:53:24.079]  I just came to watch my LED.
[00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:25.721]  Life Before the Collapse.
[00:53:25.721 --> 00:53:26.923]  Vinyl LV.
[00:53:26.923 --> 00:53:28.945]  By The Lost Vegas.
[00:53:28.945 --> 00:53:30.727]  Drinking too much coffee.
[00:53:30.727 --> 00:53:32.890]  I'm needing a shave in summer.
[00:53:38.996 --> 00:53:52.586]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[00:53:52.586 --> 00:53:55.428]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas.
[00:53:55.428 --> 00:53:56.569]  Now available at Amazon.com.
[00:54:13.973 --> 00:54:20.659]  The globalists are only a few thousand, so they will always play off different cultures and groups against each other.
[00:54:20.659 --> 00:54:27.665]  The globalists will always ally themselves with groups that are minorities, teach them a liberation theology of persecution.
[00:54:27.665 --> 00:54:31.909]  This has been taught for 50 plus years now in high schools and colleges in the U.S.
[00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:35.592]  And I mean, I remember these stories for years.
[00:54:35.592 --> 00:54:41.537]  We need to get Watson, one of the Watsons, or Aaron, or somebody to do a report tonight on the nightly news.
[00:54:41.537 --> 00:54:42.758]  You can just pull it up.
[00:54:42.758 --> 00:54:49.343]  Children forced to give Mexican Pledge of Allegiance.
[00:54:49.343 --> 00:54:51.284]  Forced to recite anthem.
[00:54:51.284 --> 00:54:53.486]  I mean, that's been in the news for decades.
[00:54:53.486 --> 00:54:55.868]  This is a curricula.
[00:54:55.868 --> 00:55:01.773]  And it's only now in the monitor
[00:55:03.584 --> 00:55:11.012]  Newspaper in McAllen, Texas because it was on the Glenn Beck Show.
[00:55:11.012 --> 00:55:12.913]  You see, you're not supposed to talk about it.
[00:55:12.913 --> 00:55:14.495]  You're not supposed to deal with it.
[00:55:14.495 --> 00:55:17.778]  You're not supposed to.
[00:55:17.778 --> 00:55:19.020]  You're not supposed to get into it.
[00:55:20.145 --> 00:55:29.327]  I got a bunch of other articles here that I want to be getting into that's coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:55:29.327 --> 00:55:32.508]  And as I said earlier, I'm going to get into Fast and Furious.
[00:55:32.508 --> 00:55:33.948]  Oh, it's now admitted.
[00:55:33.948 --> 00:55:38.669]  The head of the committee, Issa, the congressman, says it was going on during the Bush administration.
[00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:41.930]  Oh, you mean Iran-Contra was going on during Reagan?
[00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:46.431]  Oh, you mean guns were being shipped out of the country and heroin back in in the 1950s?
[00:55:48.504 --> 00:55:50.065]  Out of Vietnam.
[00:55:50.065 --> 00:55:51.625]  It was called Indochina.
[00:55:51.625 --> 00:55:52.086]  The U.S.
[00:55:52.086 --> 00:55:55.227]  had ships that landed and aircraft that landed and the French loaded it on.
[00:55:55.227 --> 00:55:57.648]  There were congressional hearings about that in the 70s.
[00:55:57.648 --> 00:56:05.471]  There were congressional hearings in the late 90s, where the CIA inspector general admitted our government ships the majority of cocaine in and launders it in U.S.
[00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:07.532]  banks because Congress actually had a meeting about it.
[00:56:08.604 --> 00:56:20.210]  And now our troops go on national news, Geraldo, Fox, ABC, BBC, I've played all the newscast here, and say, yes, we help grow the opium, and then we help ship it out.
[00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.771]  Out of Afghanistan.
[00:56:21.771 --> 00:56:26.994]  And there's no discussion about, but then you put people in jail for using it?
[00:56:26.994 --> 00:56:36.659]  Humans are addicted, our addictive personalities, we have it chemically, the system knows, so they put out Oxycontin for people that are into legal drugs.
[00:56:37.714 --> 00:56:40.775]  And they put out methamphetamine for those that are illegal.
[00:56:40.775 --> 00:56:43.177]  And cocaine and heroin.
[00:56:43.177 --> 00:56:46.538]  And they bring it in and they keep it illegal to keep the price high.
[00:56:46.538 --> 00:56:51.901]  And then they put you in their private prisons working for 25 cents an hour, displacing the workers.
[00:56:51.901 --> 00:56:55.382]  Everybody loves to complain about illegal aliens robbing our wages and being on welfare.
[00:56:55.382 --> 00:56:56.483]  I'm here to complain about it.
[00:56:56.483 --> 00:56:57.263]  I don't like paying for it.
[00:56:57.263 --> 00:56:58.424]  I'm sick of it.
[00:56:58.424 --> 00:57:01.985]  Especially when I get a Mexican flag waved in my face all day.
[00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:02.286]  But!
[00:57:03.527 --> 00:57:20.144]  I'm smart enough to understand the social engineering that did it, and I'm smart enough to know that it's the real thing taking our jobs is the 4 million people working for 25 cents an hour or less in all these private prison industries, which in every case are owned by big mega banks known to water the drug money.
[00:57:20.144 --> 00:57:20.784]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:57:21.565 --> 00:57:39.343]  The drug dealers bring the drugs in, their agents, the police, bring you to jail, their agents, the judges, put you in jail, the goody two-shoe juries go along with it, and you're put in a jail and in a prison run and profited by the drug dealers.
[00:57:39.343 --> 00:57:41.085]  I know I've talked about this for a long time, but
[00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:43.731]  It's now out.
[00:57:43.731 --> 00:57:48.932]  What I told you six, eight months ago, Bush is involved and it goes right back to Clinton.
[00:57:48.932 --> 00:57:49.692]  It goes right back.
[00:57:49.692 --> 00:57:51.893]  It never stopped.
[00:57:51.893 --> 00:57:55.474]  1832, British monopoly, skull and bones, opium to this country.
[00:57:55.474 --> 00:57:59.014]  When the monopoly got broken in the 30s, they made it illegal in the U.S.
[00:57:59.014 --> 00:58:01.935]  Before they could just control it out of India.
[00:58:01.935 --> 00:58:06.376]  But the French started taking it out after that, out of
[00:58:07.648 --> 00:58:08.769]  Indochina.
[00:58:08.769 --> 00:58:11.031]  And so they had to make it illegal.
[00:58:11.031 --> 00:58:16.537]  They had to make it illegal so they can make more money when you run it in your veins.
[00:58:16.537 --> 00:58:18.319]  That's so important to them.
[00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:19.099]  Now we're going to go to break.
[00:58:19.099 --> 00:58:20.981]  We're going to come back and start taking your phone calls.
[00:58:20.981 --> 00:58:23.324]  Remember this is listener supported radio.
[00:58:23.324 --> 00:58:24.265]  Support our sponsors.

[00:58:43.377 --> 00:58:51.761]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:55.783]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:55.783 --> 00:58:59.044]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.044 --> 00:59:04.186]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:59:04.186 --> 00:59:10.209]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.209 --> 00:59:12.450]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.311]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.311 --> 00:59:13.551]  Bernanke?
[00:59:13.551 --> 00:59:14.172]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:14.172 --> 00:59:14.933]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:14.933 --> 00:59:16.615]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:31.894 --> 00:59:34.036]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.036 --> 00:59:39.179]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.179 --> 00:59:53.409]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:53.409 --> 00:59:55.791]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.791 --> 00:59:58.573]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:10.061]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:11.662]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.662 --> 01:00:13.204]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.204 --> 01:00:17.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.408 --> 01:00:21.472]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.353 --> 01:00:27.714]  Alright, we're going to have open phones throughout this hour.
[01:00:27.714 --> 01:00:29.174]  More on Fast and Furious.
[01:00:29.174 --> 01:00:32.415]  Going back to Bush, as we told you, but it's big breaking news.
[01:00:32.415 --> 01:00:35.516]  Fox News will probably get a Pulitzer Prize for it.
[01:00:35.516 --> 01:00:41.338]  Daryl Issa now admitting the obvious, because they can't go after Obama, because Bush is involved.
[01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:42.139]  They're all involved.
[01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.240]  You think flying guns out and drugs in is something new?
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.160]  It's just how criminal these people are.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.921]  Let's just be honest about it.
[01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:53.382]  And anytime you idiots use illegal drugs, or legal, you're helping the globalists with their products.
[01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:57.431]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[01:00:57.431 --> 01:01:00.952]  We've got a lot of other news as well, but obviously callers bring up important news.
[01:01:00.952 --> 01:01:05.173]  We've got Thomas, Nick, John, Julio, Tim, and many others.
[01:01:05.173 --> 01:01:10.434]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:13.274]  Let's go ahead and talk to Thomas in Pennsylvania.
[01:01:13.274 --> 01:01:14.815]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:14.815 --> 01:01:16.695]  Hi, Alex Jones?
[01:01:16.695 --> 01:01:17.835]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:17.835 --> 01:01:20.376]  Yeah, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.756]  I'm getting tired of Glenn Beck.
[01:01:23.804 --> 01:01:26.565]  Uh, I'm from New Jersey, right?
[01:01:26.565 --> 01:01:28.785]  Pennsylvania?
[01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:35.667]  And, like, who's going to get out there and take the job to be a police officer?
[01:01:35.667 --> 01:01:39.528]  Like, who would want the job these days?
[01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:40.868]  Especially in Philadelphia, 1776.
[01:01:40.868 --> 01:01:41.648]  You understand, Alex?
[01:01:46.087 --> 01:01:49.210]  Well, yeah, because of the way they train the police and what they try to get them to do.
[01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:55.195]  A lot of times it's only control freaks that want to be police or the military.
[01:01:55.195 --> 01:01:57.097]  They need a job when they're getting out.
[01:01:57.097 --> 01:02:07.606]  They've served five tours walking around in knee-deep in blood, and they come back completely, you know, freaked out and are now pulling you and your family over.
[01:02:07.606 --> 01:02:12.791]  Well, your car's not, you know, if you're violating something in the street, you have to be pulled over.
[01:02:13.718 --> 01:02:26.266]  I mean, but that's one thing, but... Yeah, you've got to be pulled over for having the inspection sticker out by one week, but if you're a big bank laundering hundreds of billions of dollars and running giant child kidnapping rings, well that's okay.
[01:02:26.266 --> 01:02:43.236]  You know a guy that was in the SS in 1940, he's 83 years old now, he was in the SS for six weeks over in Germany, and I know German people, a lot of Germans, and they're very good with their hands, you know what I mean?
[01:02:44.301 --> 01:02:48.364]  They're very good at doing things, most of the German people.
[01:02:48.364 --> 01:03:04.315]  And it seems like if you see a German person on the police department, you know, or an Italian guy, it just isn't the same anymore, like it was 40 years ago.
[01:03:04.315 --> 01:03:06.657]  Like, you're implying that they're a bunch of Nazis.
[01:03:09.312 --> 01:03:12.254]  No, I'm not implying they're all a bunch of Nazis.
[01:03:12.254 --> 01:03:19.799]  What the federal government is doing with social engineering is an us-against-them, militarized police against the public.
[01:03:20.956 --> 01:03:22.556]  Yeah, I mean it's nice out in Texas, isn't it?
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.941]  Would you want to live in Jersey?
[01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:54.341]  Really?
[01:03:54.341 --> 01:03:54.721]  I don't know.
[01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:57.022]  I've seen some nice areas in New Jersey.
[01:03:57.022 --> 01:03:58.463]  Woods and pretty stuff.
[01:03:58.463 --> 01:04:00.763]  I know it's got some really bad areas.
[01:04:00.763 --> 01:04:01.944]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:04:01.944 --> 01:04:03.925]  It's good to hear from you.
[01:04:03.925 --> 01:04:05.105]  Calling from New Hampshire.
[01:04:05.105 --> 01:04:07.846]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[01:04:07.846 --> 01:04:11.827]  I know.
[01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:12.908]  Where was that caller calling from?
[01:04:16.547 --> 01:04:17.628]  Pennsylvania.
[01:04:17.628 --> 01:04:26.755]  Then we're going to go to Nick in New Jersey, and then John in Texas, Tim in Wisconsin, Julio, and others that are patiently holding here today.
[01:04:26.755 --> 01:04:30.797]  And then I have this really weird article, cover of the New York Times.
[01:04:30.797 --> 01:04:39.364]  You've got to have a magnifying glass to see it, but the guy's got a bunch of my bumper stickers on his placard, and it's got Infowars.com, prisonmoney.com.
[01:04:39.964 --> 01:04:43.426]  Under it, they got an In The Fed sign here.
[01:04:43.426 --> 01:04:43.986]  Just amazing.
[01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:47.188]  And they admit that it's really a diverse group, not just George Soros people.
[01:04:47.188 --> 01:04:47.869]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:47.869 --> 01:04:48.269]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.503 --> 01:05:06.464]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.464 --> 01:05:15.325]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.325 --> 01:05:19.946]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.946 --> 01:05:30.768]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.408 --> 01:05:40.930]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:46.352]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.352 --> 01:05:53.833]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.833 --> 01:05:56.254]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:00.459 --> 01:06:01.620]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:08.543]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.543 --> 01:06:11.104]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.104 --> 01:06:16.487]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.487 --> 01:06:19.528]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.528 --> 01:06:21.589]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:21.849 --> 01:06:28.094]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.094 --> 01:06:31.476]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.476 --> 01:06:37.261]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:38.902]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:38.902 --> 01:06:40.203]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.203 --> 01:06:42.865]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:47.088]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:47.088 --> 01:06:49.690]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:53.875]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:54.476]  Number one.
[01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:09.754]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.754 --> 01:07:14.658]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.658 --> 01:07:15.399]  It's true.
[01:07:15.399 --> 01:07:21.104]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:24.687]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.687 --> 01:07:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:29.391]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.391 --> 01:07:32.153]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.153 --> 01:07:35.835]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.835 --> 01:07:36.616]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.616 --> 01:07:40.759]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.759 --> 01:07:45.522]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.802 --> 01:07:49.985]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.985 --> 01:07:51.766]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.766 --> 01:07:54.007]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:54.007 --> 01:07:56.829]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.829 --> 01:08:06.015]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.015 --> 01:08:08.297]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:11.073 --> 01:08:17.636]  It is Tuesday, October 18, 2011, and I'm here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:08:17.636 --> 01:08:19.257]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:19.257 --> 01:08:23.158]  Central Standard Time, back 7 o'clock, InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:08:23.158 --> 01:08:27.480]  And I went ahead and basically co-hosted my own show last night with Aaron Dyke sitting in.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.803]  He'll be sitting in tonight as well, and I intend to pop in on some big developments.
[01:08:33.803 --> 01:08:37.785]  If you just joined us, it was big news yesterday, made national news.
[01:08:38.305 --> 01:08:56.401]  And then they finally reported on it locally here on the South Texas, the local Monitor newspaper reported that in McAllen, they have the high school students pledge allegiance to Mexico and stand for the Mexican Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:08:56.401 --> 01:08:57.582]  And of course, they're also taught
[01:08:58.823 --> 01:08:59.224]  The U.S.
[01:08:59.224 --> 01:09:00.685]  really belongs to Mexico and is evil.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.081]  Uh, and this is taught everywhere.
[01:09:16.081 --> 01:09:18.501]  This was, this was taught when I was in high school.
[01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:23.742]  It was just that America was bad, and Mexico controlled the Southwest, and Laurie Conquista was good.
[01:09:23.742 --> 01:09:35.245]  We were taken to UT as seniors in high school to be brainwashed, and I got up and said, this isn't true, and they freaked out, and they called the teacher aside, the UT professor, and said, well, who is this person?
[01:09:35.245 --> 01:09:40.586]  You know, they were very concerned I might be some type of evil radical, because I actually had two brain cells to rub together.
[01:09:40.586 --> 01:09:42.547]  Uh, and that was 20 years ago.
[01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:44.186]  20?
[01:09:44.186 --> 01:09:46.707]  Yeah, 20 years ago.
[01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:51.470]  Wow, 20 years ago.
[01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.750]  Was it more than 20 years ago?
[01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:54.671]  I'm getting old here, folks.
[01:09:54.671 --> 01:09:58.273]  It's been more time I've been out of high school than I was, you know, before.
[01:09:58.273 --> 01:10:00.414]  Just amazing.
[01:10:00.414 --> 01:10:01.134]  Time flies.
[01:10:01.134 --> 01:10:03.255]  All right, I want to take your calls.
[01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:09.778]  Also, it's being reported all over the United States, county-city layoffs.
[01:10:10.763 --> 01:10:18.737]  And they're also laying off police and the police they're keeping, this is a long trend but it's getting serious now, are only there to revenue generate.
[01:10:18.737 --> 01:10:23.725]  They actually say this, we're here to collect money from you so we got jobs, we're not here to respond to crimes.
[01:10:24.978 --> 01:10:28.760]  And everything's got to go to the federal government.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:36.904]  Or to the derivatives, because your county and city invest in the derivatives by the Bankster-Madoff types, the Kinley types, and now it's over.
[01:10:36.904 --> 01:10:39.865]  And so taxes go up, but you get less services.
[01:10:39.865 --> 01:10:41.546]  That's austerity.
[01:10:41.546 --> 01:10:51.551]  And the media has tried to point to a bunch of well-meaning hippies and people with signs saying, redistribute or else, redistribute, or violence, redistribute or revolution.
[01:10:51.551 --> 01:10:52.191]  Redistribute?
[01:10:52.191 --> 01:10:53.492]  How about in corporate welfare?
[01:10:54.412 --> 01:10:57.833]  How about in the private Federal Reserve that engineered this economic problem?
[01:10:57.833 --> 01:11:07.517]  We've got so much industry, so many ideas, so much desire for commerce, that as long as you have freedom, your country is going to be a great place to live.
[01:11:08.424 --> 01:11:15.370]  But we've let the globalists make drugs illegal so they can bring them in and create a crime culture and put people in prison.
[01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:21.795]  We've let them ship our jobs to China where the globalists have made deals where they can operate and others can't to drive down our wages.
[01:11:21.795 --> 01:11:29.581]  We've let them create a giant prison industry with 4 million plus people working for 25 cents an hour or less to drive down our wages.
[01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:37.948]  We've allowed a giant government complex to grow and now they keep taxing and taxing and then it doesn't matter how much they tax, everything falls apart.
[01:11:39.284 --> 01:11:41.725]  So we're now to that point.
[01:11:41.725 --> 01:11:42.866]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:44.566]  Let's talk to Nick in New Hampshire.
[01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.228]  Thanks for holding.
[01:11:47.228 --> 01:11:48.148]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:11:48.148 --> 01:11:49.509]  How are you?
[01:11:49.509 --> 01:11:50.429]  I am good.
[01:11:50.429 --> 01:11:51.590]  It is good to talk to you today.
[01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.010]  Welcome.
[01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.071]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:11:54.071 --> 01:11:56.032]  Thank you.
[01:11:56.032 --> 01:12:02.695]  Friday on my drive home from work, I was listening to the radio and I caught a story.
[01:12:02.695 --> 01:12:05.616]  It was a small story that on
[01:12:06.303 --> 01:12:15.365]  Wednesday of last week, President Obama sent special forces to Central Africa.
[01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:18.706]  Uganda!
[01:12:18.706 --> 01:12:22.627]  And I just thought that was, you know, kind of weird.
[01:12:22.627 --> 01:12:27.389]  I did a little more investigating and found, of all places, a CNN story.
[01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:34.691]  It's under the CNN World section and they quote, here's a quote from the article,
[01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:53.464]  The group could perhaps be described as a small-time Christian version of Al-Qaeda, led by Joseph Kony, a cult-like figure as equally delusional as the former AQ Al-Qaeda emir, Osama bin Laden.
[01:12:54.139 --> 01:12:55.381]  No, no, that's what they do.
[01:12:55.381 --> 01:13:02.629]  They just say, these Ron Paul supporters are like Al Qaeda in their internal police training manuals.
[01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:07.074]  Now all the new TV ads, it's white Al Qaeda, the minorities are reporting them.
[01:13:07.074 --> 01:13:12.740]  Al Qaeda is just a label they put on anything they want, and yes, they're there going after, quote, Christians.
[01:13:13.801 --> 01:13:20.844]  In Uganda, to displace them with Animas, Muslims, and others, it's the same thing in other parts of that area.
[01:13:20.844 --> 01:13:29.248]  They'll play off one tribe against another, Hutus against Tutsis, but generally the UN sides against Christians.
[01:13:29.248 --> 01:13:31.949]  And it's all about resource wars.
[01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:37.272]  And look, in our film, The Obama Deception, been out for almost three years, I keep tooting our horn.
[01:13:37.992 --> 01:13:53.328]  We show troops invading Africa, starting in Libya, with AFRICON, and say that Obama is the black face, put in there, given the peace prize, he'd just been given it when that film came out, so that it would be seen as if, well, he's a man of peace.
[01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:58.934]  I mean, you know, the army tank is painted rainbow colors, so even though it's running over the top of us, it must be all right.
[01:13:59.915 --> 01:14:07.717]  They're invading Ivory Coast, Gold Coast, Uganda, Sudan, Somalia, Libya.
[01:14:07.717 --> 01:14:10.698]  They're about to do operations in Tunisia.
[01:14:10.698 --> 01:14:14.418]  They've overthrown their old dictator in Egypt.
[01:14:14.418 --> 01:14:18.639]  They wanted to use Libya and those giant airfields and that water supply.
[01:14:18.639 --> 01:14:25.181]  Libya was building up all of Africa to shut off the resources to Africa, the water and machinery and oil.
[01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:26.622]  Oh, it's crazy.
[01:14:26.622 --> 01:14:29.624]  I actually haven't, I didn't catch the article, but I wasn't sure if InfoWars was
[01:14:50.937 --> 01:14:53.520]  I had reported on this, yes.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:02.247]  It's just, when I heard that, I immediately thought, you know, Africa has a lot of resources, you know, immediately I just went to it.
[01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:05.390]  But sir, they're Christian Al-Qaeda, they've got to be killed!
[01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:08.573]  There's gold mines in that area!
[01:15:08.573 --> 01:15:17.021]  And, you know, the article goes on to say that, you know, I'll paraphrase, the only thing that Obama has to risk is, you know,
[01:15:17.856 --> 01:15:28.768]  Maybe deaths, you know, American deaths, but because this battlefield is Africa, you know, it's not quantity, it's quality, and the deaths should be limited.
[01:15:29.369 --> 01:15:35.173]  You know, and as to say, oh, that totally vindicates and justifies going into Africa.
[01:15:35.173 --> 01:15:40.377]  But sir, he is part black and a liberal, so it's good.
[01:15:40.377 --> 01:15:47.421]  Listen, when he drops a bomb on a wedding and kills 200 people to kill one, quote, Al-Qaeda, that's peace, sir.
[01:15:48.542 --> 01:15:51.545]  And, you know, Cheney was wrong for waterboarding people.
[01:15:51.545 --> 01:15:57.411]  That was evil and horrible, Obama said, but actually blowing women and children up everywhere, that's... Sir?
[01:15:57.411 --> 01:15:59.613]  Sir, you're a right-wing extremist, aren't you?
[01:15:59.613 --> 01:16:04.117]  I mean, you're not for war and just invading all of Africa and killing everybody?
[01:16:04.915 --> 01:16:05.515]  I mean, the U.N.
[01:16:05.515 --> 01:16:08.136]  just got caught again in Africa.
[01:16:08.136 --> 01:16:08.857]  The U.N.
[01:16:08.857 --> 01:16:11.818]  just got caught in Uganda just two weeks ago.
[01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:20.562]  Paul Watson wrote about this with a private mercenaries burning down whole villages on their own property and lining people up and shooting them.
[01:16:20.562 --> 01:16:23.023]  And even mainstream media said, well, it's for the earth.
[01:16:23.023 --> 01:16:24.424]  So they're reducing carbon.
[01:16:25.526 --> 01:16:29.388]  When you kill people, it's loving.
[01:16:29.388 --> 01:16:31.329]  This is liberal right now.
[01:16:31.329 --> 01:16:39.374]  In Honduras, they're murdering people en masse for their property to quote, take it over for carbon offsets.
[01:16:39.374 --> 01:16:41.215]  This is so loving.
[01:16:41.215 --> 01:16:43.156]  This is so trendy, sir.
[01:16:43.156 --> 01:16:45.037]  As long as you say something's trendy.
[01:16:45.037 --> 01:16:52.921]  I mean, if you walked up and hacked a woman up on the side of the street with a meat cleaver, but said, I'm liberal, I'm liberal, trendy, trendy, it would somehow be loving and liberal.
[01:16:52.921 --> 01:16:54.062]  Of course, actually, you go to prison.
[01:16:54.642 --> 01:16:57.904]  But if you're a globalist anointed one, it's loving and liberal.
[01:16:57.904 --> 01:17:00.485]  And I mean, so what if the UN is running around mass murdering?
[01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:03.447]  It's trendy.
[01:17:03.447 --> 01:17:04.488]  You're not trendy?
[01:17:04.488 --> 01:17:06.389]  You're not trendy, sir?
[01:17:06.389 --> 01:17:07.109]  I'm trying.
[01:17:07.109 --> 01:17:10.031]  I'm really trying, but it's kind of hard.
[01:17:10.031 --> 01:17:11.412]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:17:11.412 --> 01:17:12.512]  Folks, that was an extremist.
[01:17:12.512 --> 01:17:14.113]  I apologize for him.
[01:17:14.113 --> 01:17:16.214]  It's liberal and loving.
[01:17:16.214 --> 01:17:21.718]  UN forces, World Bank forces, murdering people all over the place, lining them up, shooting them.
[01:17:21.718 --> 01:17:23.579]  It's to plant trees
[01:17:24.810 --> 01:17:25.390]  For the Earth.
[01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:28.071]  Okay.
[01:17:28.071 --> 01:17:29.932]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[01:17:29.932 --> 01:17:31.692]  John, I hope you're not as extreme as that last guy.
[01:17:31.692 --> 01:17:34.373]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:34.373 --> 01:17:36.634]  Hello, John.
[01:17:36.634 --> 01:17:38.254]  I'm the old Vietnam veteran.
[01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:42.776]  I had a chance to meet you there in front of the Federal Reserve in Houston during the protest.
[01:17:42.776 --> 01:17:44.876]  Good to meet you, my friend.
[01:17:44.876 --> 01:17:48.057]  And one thing about that building, it amazed me, Alex.
[01:17:48.057 --> 01:17:50.238]  That's one of the scariest looking buildings I've ever seen.
[01:17:50.238 --> 01:17:53.619]  It almost looked like secret police headquarters instead of a bank.
[01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:58.207]  You know, it did kind of look, it was royal purple instead of green.
[01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:01.169]  It kind of looked like MI6 headquarters in London.
[01:18:01.169 --> 01:18:06.194]  It did look like a dungeon keeper facility with pyramids and eagles on top pyramids and everything.
[01:18:06.194 --> 01:18:06.815]  Yeah, very loving.
[01:18:08.376 --> 01:18:27.602]  I want to, you know, the Wall Street protesters sitting there saying they want to bring socialism to America, and I don't see why they're complaining, because we're already under a socialist system already, that you look at the background... Yeah, we already pay about 60% of some form of tax, but don't worry, Herman Cain's got a VAT and a sales tax federally run, having the Fed snooping in everything you do.
[01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:28.562]  I think that's wonderful!
[01:18:29.758 --> 01:18:35.203]  You look at the background, go to Google and type in Obama's communist connections, the stuff just rolls out of there.
[01:18:35.203 --> 01:18:41.209]  You look at all the people Bush surrounded himself with, the neocons, they're described as Trotskyite communists.
[01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:49.357]  I mean, it seems like everybody we get up there, any president gets up there, all he does is surround himself with these leftist people and the bankers.
[01:18:50.206 --> 01:18:54.769]  They started communism, but when they started communism, it was never about Russia or China.
[01:18:54.769 --> 01:19:04.915]  It was always about globalization, internationalism, controlling... No, no, what they do is they come in, international banks fund, and this has been going, they funded Marx and Engels, it's on record.
[01:19:04.915 --> 01:19:06.656]  It was declassified, it came out in U.S.
[01:19:06.656 --> 01:19:09.377]  government documents in the 50s and the 70s.
[01:19:09.377 --> 01:19:12.219]  And you're absolutely right, Norman Dodd committee exposed it.
[01:19:13.061 --> 01:19:15.445]  And on record, we'll talk more about this after the break, so stay there.
[01:19:15.445 --> 01:19:20.352]  I'm going to put you back on hold and then come back to you, John, in Texas to finish up.
[01:19:20.352 --> 01:19:23.277]  They come in, they fund rebels, the Bolsheviks, of course, in 1917.
[01:19:23.277 --> 01:19:24.018]  Only about 30,000 of them.
[01:19:26.786 --> 01:19:31.949]  They blow stuff up, burn everything, announce themselves in Moscow as the government.
[01:19:31.949 --> 01:19:32.710]  Then the U.S.
[01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:38.513]  and England fund them over several years to take over Russia like they're doing in Libya right now.
[01:19:38.513 --> 01:19:44.396]  And then they start the mass extermination of Christians and middle class.
[01:19:44.396 --> 01:19:45.537]  That's what all this is about.
[01:19:45.537 --> 01:19:46.938]  That's what it's always about.
[01:19:46.938 --> 01:19:49.620]  So the mega banks always fund communists.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.720]  Of course they do.
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.161]  And they teach it in schools right now.
[01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:54.462]  A communist la reconquista, kill the gringo.
[01:19:54.462 --> 01:19:55.163]  We'll be right back.

[01:21:00.036 --> 01:21:04.499]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[01:21:04.499 --> 01:21:05.999]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:14.284]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:21:14.884 --> 01:21:16.426]  Yes, my friends.
[01:21:16.426 --> 01:21:18.329]  Evil is rising.
[01:21:18.329 --> 01:21:19.230]  But take heart.
[01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:23.175]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:21:23.175 --> 01:21:28.601]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:21:28.601 --> 01:21:32.086]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:21:32.406 --> 01:21:34.127]  The globalists are scared.
[01:21:34.127 --> 01:21:35.467]  They've overreached.
[01:21:35.467 --> 01:21:38.989]  The future of the Infowar is in your hands.

[01:21:56.637 --> 01:21:59.538]  The Infowar now goes into high gear.
[01:21:59.898 --> 01:22:03.761]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:22:03.761 --> 01:22:05.323]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[01:22:05.323 --> 01:22:06.684]  Are you feeling tired?
[01:22:06.684 --> 01:22:08.665]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:22:08.665 --> 01:22:09.766]  It's not your fault.
[01:22:09.766 --> 01:22:12.829]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:22:12.829 --> 01:22:18.854]  And if you're an African-American man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[01:22:18.854 --> 01:22:20.395]  Be the man you used to be.

[01:22:52.308 --> 01:22:55.773]  Last July, a rare webinar was released that has since transformed lives all around the world.

[01:23:24.352 --> 01:23:30.894]  A water secret so powerful, some have called it the number one threat to the entire New World Order health agenda.
[01:23:31.414 --> 01:23:40.677]  Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles like lead, aluminum, and even mercury and remove these accumulated poisons from your body and your drinking water.
[01:23:40.677 --> 01:23:47.779]  You can take your water freedom into your own hands and defend yourself and your family from the globalist health agenda.

[01:24:13.012 --> 01:24:21.120]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.564]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[01:24:30.487 --> 01:24:41.811]  Alright, we're going back to John in Texas, and then we're going to Tim in Wisconsin, Julio, Phil, Michael, and many others.
[01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:46.693]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:24:46.693 --> 01:24:49.574]  Big national news broke today.
[01:24:49.574 --> 01:24:54.276]  Congressman Issa came out and said Bush was running gun-running operations just like Obama.
[01:24:56.067 --> 01:25:05.230]  Now they're having to admit that to try to divert attention, basically, and make it about the perjury of Eric Holder.
[01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:12.332]  Instead of the narcotics shipped into the U.S., the guns shipped out.
[01:25:12.332 --> 01:25:18.014]  And for mainstream media, for the addled, lazy mainstream media listening to this show,
[01:25:19.136 --> 01:25:25.120]  If you want to get your editor to let you break a big story, this stuff's all hidden in plain view.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.621]  It's in the Chicago Tribune.
[01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:30.244]  It's in the El Paso Times.
[01:25:30.244 --> 01:25:31.344]  It's all there.
[01:25:31.344 --> 01:25:39.230]  We've written articles about it before they did, because our listeners looked at the federal court records that were public and sent them to us.
[01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:45.214]  In the court records, it says the gun running was going on for five and a half years to Sinaloa alone.
[01:25:45.214 --> 01:25:47.736]  That puts it two and a half years into the Bush administration.
[01:25:48.516 --> 01:25:56.700]  The 18 wheelers of guns, the plane loads of guns, the agreements to let them ship in drugs if they launder the money through certain banks.
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:03.764]  Our government, our criminal government, our illegitimate government, declaring national security in the trials and saying it's true.
[01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:08.170]  Okay, it's all there.
[01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:09.250]  All the proof.
[01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:10.431]  All of it.
[01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:14.653]  And how this nasty government was going to use it against our Second Amendment.
[01:26:14.653 --> 01:26:15.753]  Grow up, folks!
[01:26:15.753 --> 01:26:16.914]  We're in trouble.
[01:26:16.914 --> 01:26:19.355]  We've got corrupt criminals in charge.
[01:26:19.355 --> 01:26:22.916]  There's not time to screw around and live in denial anymore!
[01:26:22.916 --> 01:26:23.897]  They're dropping the hammer.
[01:26:23.897 --> 01:26:26.098]  They're closing the gate on us.
[01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:27.798]  They're bringing in hardcore tyranny.
[01:26:27.798 --> 01:26:29.559]  They're setting up national police.
[01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:32.501]  The CIA's admittedly taking over all the major police departments.
[01:26:32.501 --> 01:26:33.221]  Totally illegal!
[01:26:35.058 --> 01:26:36.659]  Oh, man, we're in trouble, folks.
[01:26:36.659 --> 01:26:41.840]  They're setting up a domestic police state because they know we're waking up to the tens of trillions of derivatives they stole.
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.201]  We got a bunch of crooks up there.
[01:26:43.201 --> 01:26:45.061]  They only need to go to jail like Nadov.
[01:26:45.061 --> 01:26:48.102]  Instead, they're going to drop the hammer and bring in a tyranny.
[01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:51.743]  And these banksters, folks, they funded the Nazis.
[01:26:51.743 --> 01:26:53.544]  They funded the Bolsheviks.
[01:26:53.544 --> 01:26:54.384]  They funded Mao.
[01:26:54.384 --> 01:26:55.404]  That's been declassified.
[01:26:55.404 --> 01:26:56.645]  They kicked out Chiang Kai-shek.
[01:26:57.481 --> 01:27:02.865]  I knew that from congressional reports and experts we interviewed decades ago, like Jim Griffin.
[01:27:02.865 --> 01:27:04.666]  But now it's all been declassified.
[01:27:04.666 --> 01:27:09.610]  They admit our government, Mao Zedong, who killed the Chinese, say 84 million.
[01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:13.273]  Our government says 66 million.
[01:27:13.273 --> 01:27:15.474]  You can look it up, Wikipedia has it all up there.
[01:27:15.474 --> 01:27:17.416]  The Chinese government says Mao killed 80 plus.
[01:27:18.658 --> 01:27:20.218]  Eighty-plus million people.
[01:27:20.218 --> 01:27:23.399]  I mean, Zbigniew Brzezinski writes books.
[01:27:23.399 --> 01:27:24.219]  Two of them.
[01:27:24.219 --> 01:27:25.119]  You can pull up the quotes.
[01:27:25.119 --> 01:27:27.800]  Brzezinski talks about Pol Pot and millions dead.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.500]  You can pull it up.
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:34.241]  In his books, he says, yes, I put Pol Pot in and helped him.
[01:27:34.241 --> 01:27:38.262]  We couldn't kill millions, but Pol Pot sure could when we helped him.
[01:27:38.262 --> 01:27:39.982]  Real funny little legal term.
[01:27:39.982 --> 01:27:40.943]  I didn't kill millions.
[01:27:40.943 --> 01:27:46.444]  I just gave him the funds and the resources to do it.
[01:27:46.444 --> 01:27:47.444]  I didn't kill anybody.
[01:27:48.743 --> 01:27:56.626]  I just flipped the switch and opened the trap door, and then the rope around their neck and their own gravity broke their neck.
[01:27:56.626 --> 01:27:57.947]  You know, the executioner.
[01:27:57.947 --> 01:27:58.867]  I didn't kill you!
[01:27:58.867 --> 01:28:00.028]  Ha ha ha!
[01:28:00.028 --> 01:28:00.728]  Pull the lever.
[01:28:00.728 --> 01:28:02.569]  Ha ha ha!
[01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:05.410]  All this illegal trash behavior from these people.
[01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:13.113]  Ruthless, cunning, murderous psychos who all revel and try to one-up each other on how absolutely ruthless they are.
[01:28:14.815 --> 01:28:23.958]  And then more and more evil will get in, just like Mexico, until it's just people worshipping grim reapers, 40,000 dead, total insanity, running around killing each other.
[01:28:23.958 --> 01:28:26.559]  This is what happens when civilization falls apart.
[01:28:26.559 --> 01:28:29.239]  This is what happens when good people stop being involved.
[01:28:29.239 --> 01:28:36.501]  And I'm sorry to be ranting, John, I'm going to give you the last word and hold you over if we've got a break here, but unless you can finish, it's just that you bring up red terror and stuff.
[01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:37.922]  Yes, that's what they had planned here.
[01:28:38.362 --> 01:28:42.245]  They're going to unleash the dumb, moron, public school people that want a job.
[01:28:42.245 --> 01:28:44.427]  They don't know it's globalism that destroyed them.
[01:28:44.427 --> 01:28:45.768]  And they're going to turn them loose on everybody.
[01:28:45.768 --> 01:28:47.270]  The whole society will fall apart.
[01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:53.615]  And the globalists will sit offshore in their armored mansions and private islands while their secret police kill millions of us.
[01:28:53.615 --> 01:28:57.518]  And then they'll come back later and take everything over.
[01:28:57.518 --> 01:28:59.220]  If we don't get the word out, it's all over.
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.721]  This is what's going to happen.
[01:29:00.721 --> 01:29:01.662]  Final comments on that.
[01:29:02.878 --> 01:29:22.748]  Yeah, Alex, that's one of the things I was thinking about, and one of the scams that the Globals could run, it'd be like the Spanish Civil War, where the military rolls up favors from the communists, and instituted a fascist regime with a Franco running it, you know, and we could go... That's how they always do it, they give you a commie, or they give you a fascist, and it's all black uniforms and collectivism.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:25.861]  That's all I got to say.
[01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:27.382]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:29:27.382 --> 01:29:27.962]  Okay, awesome.
[01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:28.422]  Good to hear from you.
[01:29:28.422 --> 01:29:29.803]  Good meeting you down there.
[01:29:29.803 --> 01:29:31.605]  He just got me thinking, so I did that rant.
[01:29:31.605 --> 01:29:35.167]  Alright, I promise I'll go through these calls.
[01:29:35.167 --> 01:29:38.589]  800-259-9231 when we get back.
[01:29:38.589 --> 01:29:39.770]  And then I'll get into Fast and Furious.
[01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:40.351]  Stay with us.

[01:29:50.057 --> 01:29:51.438]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.438 --> 01:29:52.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.974 --> 01:30:00.679]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:22.656]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[01:30:22.856 --> 01:30:26.977]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:26.977 --> 01:30:29.318]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[01:30:29.318 --> 01:30:34.339]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.

[01:31:03.323 --> 01:31:08.628]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.628 --> 01:31:10.170]  Saving means to make money.

[01:31:27.223 --> 01:31:35.226]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:24.331]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.331 --> 01:32:30.315]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.315 --> 01:32:33.998]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.498 --> 01:32:38.782]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[01:32:44.727 --> 01:32:48.291]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.291 --> 01:32:50.252]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.252 --> 01:32:51.393]  It's here.

[01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:51.733]  Yeah.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:18.721]  Man, that is awesome news!
[01:34:18.721 --> 01:34:27.346]  And I'm so proud of the fact that for now a couple years on their official site, they are big fans of this show.
[01:34:27.346 --> 01:34:34.430]  I've interviewed Bellamy before, but the only links they have are to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, at least last time I checked.
[01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:40.114]  And when Glenn Beck came out and endorsed him and said he loved him, they put a message out saying, we don't want to be endorsed by you.
[01:34:40.114 --> 01:34:43.396]  But when I had Bellamy on, I didn't think to even get his number.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:53.162]  And then, didn't even try to get him back on for like a year later, and once we tried to get him, hold him, I mean, no way to get through his management.
[01:34:53.162 --> 01:34:57.103]  Because you know they're getting hit with, they just get bigger and bigger, total superstars.
[01:34:57.103 --> 01:34:59.603]  But it doesn't matter, I just wanted to get him back on the show.
[01:34:59.603 --> 01:35:01.223]  We feel the love from far away.
[01:35:01.223 --> 01:35:08.785]  And Bellamy's also worn InfoWars shirts on stage, Terror Storm, he's made handmade ones, plug in our films on national TV.
[01:35:10.047 --> 01:35:11.251]  We will be victorious.
[01:35:11.251 --> 01:35:15.225]  We've got to unite and watch our flag ascend.
[01:35:16.445 --> 01:35:20.966]  But Matthew Bellamy, I mean, he makes tens of millions of dollars a year.
[01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:23.606]  Because people want to buy his music.
[01:35:23.606 --> 01:35:26.427]  Should he have to give his money away?
[01:35:26.427 --> 01:35:28.567]  I mean, he lives in England.
[01:35:28.567 --> 01:35:31.668]  They pay more than 60% in one form of tax or another.
[01:35:31.668 --> 01:35:36.389]  Is it okay for Bellamy to keep 40% of his money and hire and employ all these people?
[01:35:36.389 --> 01:35:38.209]  Is he a bad guy because he's rich now?
[01:35:38.209 --> 01:35:40.390]  Because his ideas were popular?
[01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:41.690]  That's what freedom's all about!
[01:35:43.203 --> 01:35:49.127]  You know, this idea of collectivism, I've seen novels and short films out there.
[01:35:49.127 --> 01:36:04.596]  Can't place the name at the time of, you know, a nightmare future where somebody's tall and handsome so they deform their face, or somebody's an athlete so they cut their hamstring, or everybody has all these weird things attached to them to make sure everybody's the same.
[01:36:04.596 --> 01:36:08.018]  All of us have certain gifts that others don't have.
[01:36:08.018 --> 01:36:09.720]  I have the gift of discernment.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.161]  of analysis.
[01:36:12.161 --> 01:36:21.064]  But without love, as Corinthians, I was reading Corinthians this morning and I meant to come over to this room where we're doing the show out of and read from Corinthians today.
[01:36:21.064 --> 01:36:23.184]  In fact, I'm going to call Richard right now.
[01:36:23.184 --> 01:36:26.145]  I think he's over at the other room.
[01:36:26.145 --> 01:36:29.006]  And to bring my Bible over here.
[01:36:29.006 --> 01:36:31.107]  I'm sorry, we don't want to hear the Bible.
[01:36:31.107 --> 01:36:33.108]  But I was reading Corinthians with my children this morning.
[01:36:34.586 --> 01:36:36.889]  And I don't thump the Bible.
[01:36:36.889 --> 01:36:38.231]  I just know it's beautiful.
[01:36:38.231 --> 01:36:41.616]  Let me call Richard here real quick.
[01:36:41.616 --> 01:36:42.557]  Well, you guys are there.
[01:36:42.557 --> 01:36:44.900]  I know my wife's out of the room.
[01:36:44.900 --> 01:36:45.862]  She went to the grocery store.
[01:36:45.862 --> 01:36:49.427]  You guys call Richard and tell him don't go to a bunch of trouble.
[01:36:50.871 --> 01:37:04.145]  But before Pchenik comes on, if we have time, get my son's workbook where we were doing, we were copying Corinthians, that way it'll all be there and real simple and just a few lines I want to read.
[01:37:04.145 --> 01:37:12.354]  But as with love, when you stop loving your fellow humanity, everything turns into a cesspool.
[01:37:12.354 --> 01:37:13.355]  Everything falls apart.
[01:37:14.896 --> 01:37:21.422]  And when you do care about others, and when you care about truth and justice, it creates a better and better society.
[01:37:21.422 --> 01:37:25.626]  And we have a world run by very cold-blooded, wicked people.
[01:37:25.626 --> 01:37:27.748]  A lot of them aren't even cold-blooded, they're very hot-blooded.
[01:37:27.748 --> 01:37:35.115]  They're wicked and enjoy hurting people, and enjoy ugliness, and enjoy pain, and enjoy lies, and enjoy degradation.
[01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:38.478]  And they try to sell us on torture and gladiatorial events, and
[01:37:40.109 --> 01:37:41.050]  All of this.
[01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:43.593]  But then they target others, you know, we want to take care of you.
[01:37:43.593 --> 01:37:47.156]  We're the nanny, nanny state situation.
[01:37:48.154 --> 01:37:53.959]  Now, I want to go back to your calls, and then into Fast and Furious, and then some other news I have here.
[01:37:53.959 --> 01:37:55.860]  Robots to aid troop patrols.
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:56.641]  Told you that's coming.
[01:37:56.641 --> 01:38:04.727]  This is a very dangerous trend, because it's going to phase out humans, and then the globalists can have their own private mechanized armies that will follow orders.
[01:38:04.727 --> 01:38:07.830]  Also, budget cuts hit county and city jobs.
[01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:10.072]  Payroll losses add to U.S.
[01:38:10.072 --> 01:38:10.732]  jobless rate.
[01:38:10.732 --> 01:38:12.173]  I want to get into that.
[01:38:12.173 --> 01:38:15.016]  I haven't talked enough about this New York Times cover story today.
[01:38:17.162 --> 01:38:19.143]  I mean, just look at that.
[01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:21.285]  Just amazing.
[01:38:21.285 --> 01:38:24.587]  Talking about the fact that the protests are really very diverse.
[01:38:24.587 --> 01:38:25.688]  It's got in the Fed.
[01:38:25.688 --> 01:38:27.850]  It's got reformed corporate welfare.
[01:38:27.850 --> 01:38:29.551]  It's got young, educated, unemployed.
[01:38:29.551 --> 01:38:31.752]  That is a big part of folks that are upset.
[01:38:31.752 --> 01:38:33.714]  Stop the wars.
[01:38:33.714 --> 01:38:36.276]  A lady that has one says, I'm very upset.
[01:38:36.276 --> 01:38:39.438]  And it says countless grievances, one thread, we're angry.
[01:38:39.438 --> 01:38:46.563]  And then they got a guy down here in the lower left-hand corner wearing an InfoWars.com, Obama limited edition, Obama Joker shirt.
[01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:53.274]  We've had so many people ask us to bring that back, but I promised it was limited edition.
[01:38:53.274 --> 01:38:55.376]  So we haven't offered that in over a year.
[01:38:55.376 --> 01:39:01.620]  But I think we ought to come out with whoever the Republican nominee is on the back
[01:39:02.754 --> 01:39:04.255]  As a joker.
[01:39:04.255 --> 01:39:05.536]  He's such an iconic image.
[01:39:05.536 --> 01:39:08.418]  And then Obama on the front.
[01:39:08.418 --> 01:39:12.882]  In fact, that's something I want to tell Tim Ferrugia to get on the ball with.
[01:39:12.882 --> 01:39:13.882]  So we want to get that out.
[01:39:13.882 --> 01:39:17.585]  The great job the crew does there in the back with our graphics people.
[01:39:17.585 --> 01:39:22.649]  Maybe have Kay come up with a new Obama joker, iconic, and then a new whoever the Republican nominee is.
[01:39:22.649 --> 01:39:23.510]  Unless it's Ron Paul!
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:33.662]  We come up with something with Ron Paul's good and the Joker's bad, who knows?
[01:39:33.662 --> 01:39:58.855]  But down here in the lower left-hand corner, he's wearing the Obama Joker shirt, and then it says, War is not the answer, 9-11 was an inside job, I don't believe the liberal media, impeach Supreme Court, corporations are not the people, and no nukes, with a Live Free or Die, Infowars.com sticker, and the 9-11 inside job sticker is also an Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com sticker.
[01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:06.050]  See that?
[01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:07.710]  That's just awesome.
[01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:10.951]  And yes, I have radio listeners always emailing, what do you mean look at that?
[01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:15.592]  We're on the radio here, that's where we reach the lion's share of our audiences, AM and FM, XM.
[01:40:15.592 --> 01:40:28.915]  But, I'm Global Shortwave, WWCR, but we're also streaming to PrisonPlanet.tv viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv and there's also Prison Planet Nightly News there, InfoWarsNightlyNews at PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsNews.com.
[01:40:29.235 --> 01:40:37.997]  Okay, I'll get into Fast and Furious, these other reports, and then Pecheneg's coming up to finish up what he was talking about Friday, coming up here in the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[01:40:37.997 --> 01:40:39.298]  But let's go to Tim in Wisconsin.
[01:40:39.298 --> 01:40:41.038]  Let's move quick now to get to everybody.
[01:40:41.038 --> 01:40:42.339]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:40:42.339 --> 01:40:45.179]  Alright, Alex, a few great ideas and stuff.
[01:40:45.179 --> 01:40:48.140]  Well, first of all, you know, like about like the Citibank and the one lady that got arrested.
[01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:54.342]  I think all InfoWars listeners should close all their Citi accounts, and if there's any local businesses that do business with Citi,
[01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:59.874]  Tell him you're not going to patronize him as long as you do business with him and show him the video of that because I'll just disgust you.
[01:40:59.874 --> 01:41:05.598]  I'm glad you called about that because I mentioned that yesterday on the radio and on TV but I didn't make a big enough deal about it.
[01:41:05.598 --> 01:41:09.000]  We should probably do a news report tonight if we have time.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:17.606]  It turns out the Washington blog at Infowars.com, we posted it, found a whole bunch of examples of people being arrested trying to shut their accounts.
[01:41:17.606 --> 01:41:22.850]  And police just pour in and say it's a disturbance and the people
[01:41:24.301 --> 01:41:26.983]  I mean, banks are trying to not give people their money.
[01:41:26.983 --> 01:41:39.551]  And this is very dangerous, though, because they want to have a bank holiday, and they'd love to shut the banks down and then blame it on the people, then devalue the currency over a week, and then you can get your money out, it's just devalued now.
[01:41:39.551 --> 01:41:40.812]  I mean, who knows what they're going to pull.
[01:41:40.812 --> 01:41:42.533]  The people certainly have a right to get their money out.
[01:41:42.533 --> 01:41:49.537]  I mean, what do you think of all these videos?
[01:41:49.537 --> 01:41:51.699]  There's a whole bunch, a whole bunch of banks are doing.
[01:41:53.854 --> 01:41:58.777]  Well, um, what I think, you know, everyone needs to do is all these big banks just cancel their accounts and just go to a local credit union.
[01:41:58.777 --> 01:42:10.664]  And then what else I think is, uh, um, you know, like, well, basically, like, any local businesses should just boycott them if they're, you know, using Citibank and then just, you know, have them cancel their accounts or switch, so.
[01:42:12.432 --> 01:42:13.812]  Well, my audio was choppy.
[01:42:13.812 --> 01:42:16.933]  This Skype works pretty good, but it breaks up a few times a day.
[01:42:16.933 --> 01:42:20.934]  That's why we're on the road testing it out as we're getting ready to go on the road with speaking engagements and things.
[01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:28.516]  But were you able to hear my comment and my question, though, that there's a whole bunch of this going on where banks won't give people their money?
[01:42:28.516 --> 01:42:29.716]  It's pretty crazy and stuff.
[01:42:29.716 --> 01:42:35.298]  I think the big banks just need to pull all of your funds, all of the accounts and stuff.
[01:42:35.298 --> 01:42:36.078]  That's what I'm going to do.
[01:42:36.078 --> 01:42:37.718]  I'm going to just switch to a local credit union.
[01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:40.539]  That's what I'm doing right now is transferring from my bank account to a credit union.
[01:42:41.252 --> 01:42:56.301]  And then what else people like should do is I um is like say any local businesses are doing business with you know Citigroup or any of the other uh you know big banks just put pressure on to move to a small town bank or credit union and move their funds you know from the big banks I think that will definitely hurt them and then uh
[01:42:56.937 --> 01:42:57.317]  I don't know.
[01:42:57.317 --> 01:42:58.118]  I agree with you.
[01:42:58.118 --> 01:43:01.299]  Citigroup, Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan.
[01:43:01.299 --> 01:43:01.940]  These are the groups.
[01:43:23.905 --> 01:43:25.887]  We've got our stuff at a Texas bank.
[01:43:25.887 --> 01:43:28.368]  We actually have some in one of the big mega banks.
[01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:35.914]  We can do international things, because a lot of local banks won't do international, or it's next to impossible to pay Watson and his brother and people.
[01:43:35.914 --> 01:43:39.697]  But we've got to move towards... Well, I am in the local credit union as well.
[01:43:39.697 --> 01:43:41.038]  That's most important.
[01:43:41.038 --> 01:43:43.040]  Your local banks are the lifeblood of the community.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.121]  They're actually loaning money, helping people.
[01:43:45.121 --> 01:43:48.123]  We need to support those and get out of the big mega banks.
[01:43:48.123 --> 01:43:48.964]  I totally agree with you.
[01:43:48.964 --> 01:43:49.565]  Good to hear from you.
[01:43:50.487 --> 01:43:53.630]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Julio in Illinois.
[01:43:53.630 --> 01:43:55.652]  Julio, welcome.
[01:43:55.652 --> 01:43:58.114]  Alejandro Jones, buenas tardes.
[01:43:58.114 --> 01:43:59.515]  How are you, Ben?
[01:43:59.515 --> 01:44:00.076]  Good, man.
[01:44:00.076 --> 01:44:02.839]  How are you?
[01:44:02.839 --> 01:44:04.620]  Big debate tonight.
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:07.343]  I'm just, I'm sick of Herman Cain.
[01:44:07.343 --> 01:44:12.127]  Hopefully everyone can check out that Herman Cain confronted on the Federal Reserve.
[01:44:12.127 --> 01:44:13.969]  Non, non, non!
[01:44:15.049 --> 01:44:24.416]  You know, I got to, you know, I asked him specifically, I got to meet a good friend, a new friend of Freedom Tim from We Are Change Chicago.
[01:44:24.416 --> 01:44:30.060]  You know, he's right there in front of all these media, Chicago Sun-Times, CBS, ABC.
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:33.423]  You know, I'm just asking him about the Federal Reserve printing money out of thin air.
[01:44:33.423 --> 01:44:35.544]  Asking, you know, I got him to admit.
[01:44:35.544 --> 01:44:38.667]  Okay, because I've seen the We Are Change videos.
[01:44:38.667 --> 01:44:40.048]  I mean, I've seen the We Are Change videos.
[01:44:41.949 --> 01:44:54.285]  Yeah, you know, I was right next to all these media people, and you know, you can see he was, uh, you can see he didn't want to answer those questions.
[01:44:54.958 --> 01:45:04.561]  And he was talking about the Constitution all day to these, you know, Tea Party supporters, talking about, oh, I support the Second Amendment and they're not going to take our guns.
[01:45:04.561 --> 01:45:12.524]  Yet, he loves Alan Greenspan, whose wife is Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC, who is supporting Occupy Wall Street.
[01:45:13.704 --> 01:45:21.371]  It's 1984, Alex, and I feel awful, and Tim and I were talking about this, we just feel awful for all these people who support Herman King.
[01:45:21.371 --> 01:45:22.992]  They're just gonna get stabbed in the back.
[01:45:22.992 --> 01:45:28.256]  We were telling people, uh, the new talking point about Ron Paul is his foreign policy.
[01:45:28.256 --> 01:45:33.681]  Well, if you look at 2008 and now, he's leading with military support and donations, correct?
[01:45:33.681 --> 01:45:34.501]  So what, the military's sad?
[01:45:34.501 --> 01:45:36.083]  They don't know what they're talking about?
[01:45:37.748 --> 01:45:39.169]  Well, look, it's more than that.
[01:45:39.169 --> 01:45:42.571]  I mean, Ron Paul's saying we don't need a new war with Iran.
[01:45:42.571 --> 01:45:43.952]  We're bankrupt.
[01:45:43.952 --> 01:45:46.713]  But the banksters want to get us deeper into bankruptcy.
[01:45:46.713 --> 01:45:51.276]  And last week, the media was attacking him, going, look, Ron Paul doesn't want to attack Iran.
[01:45:51.276 --> 01:45:52.697]  But look, they wanted to attack us.
[01:45:52.697 --> 01:45:55.679]  And now it turns out, of course, it's all made up baloney.
[01:45:55.679 --> 01:45:56.899]  That whole plot was fake.
[01:45:56.899 --> 01:45:59.121]  So the green light has dimmed quite a bit.
[01:46:00.121 --> 01:46:02.282]  And we may not see that strike happen.
[01:46:02.282 --> 01:46:06.565]  The problem is now they're talking about more Iranian fake plots they're going to bring out.
[01:46:06.565 --> 01:46:12.868]  So they don't have maneuvers going on in and around Iran right now for nothing.
[01:46:12.868 --> 01:46:16.530]  And Congressman King calling for war for nothing.
[01:46:16.530 --> 01:46:17.131]  This is what...
[01:46:17.811 --> 01:46:19.472]  I don't agree with Bernanke right now.
[01:46:19.472 --> 01:46:21.993]  I don't like all of this printing money out of thin air.
[01:46:21.993 --> 01:46:23.353]  Doesn't he say that word for word in your video?
[01:46:48.462 --> 01:47:00.588]  The Fed has a dual mission right now and we need to get them back to sound economic policy or sound money, stealing Ron Paul's words.
[01:47:00.588 --> 01:47:08.953]  Here's what I'm saying though, I've seen a Herman Cain quote, I was asking a question about that though, I've seen a Herman Cain quote, Julio, where
[01:47:10.650 --> 01:47:15.374]  Uh, Herman Cain says, listen, I work for the Federal Reserve.
[01:47:15.374 --> 01:47:17.315]  We need to get it back to its, you know, role.
[01:47:17.315 --> 01:47:18.676]  We need to shrink it.
[01:47:18.676 --> 01:47:20.297]  Well, its role is never to be shrunk.
[01:47:20.297 --> 01:47:24.740]  And he said, uh, we need, you know, we don't need it just printing money out of thin air.
[01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:26.321]  What do you think it's always done?
[01:47:27.876 --> 01:47:31.918]  And if it doesn't just create money, the federal government could do that.
[01:47:31.918 --> 01:47:33.359]  Then it's fake, whether we want that or not.
[01:47:33.359 --> 01:47:39.382]  These are debt notes, debt instruments, like derivatives, putting us into slavery, every dollar that's printed.
[01:47:39.382 --> 01:47:40.643]  So I know there's a video clip.
[01:47:40.643 --> 01:47:41.644]  I saw it this weekend.
[01:47:41.644 --> 01:47:43.945]  I meant to send it to Jerem, but never did.
[01:47:43.945 --> 01:47:50.208]  I think it's your video, where he says, I don't think we should have the Federal Reserve just printing money out of thin air.
[01:47:50.208 --> 01:47:52.109]  I know there's a quote of him saying that.
[01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:53.950]  Well, what do you think the Federal Reserve does?
[01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:54.751]  That's my point, Elio.
[01:47:55.714 --> 01:47:58.275]  Yeah, Tim was the one who edited the video.
[01:47:58.275 --> 01:48:16.379]  He did a great job, and Herman Cain was saying that the Federal Reserve was working well from 1913 to about 2000, and then this is when the only time the Federal Reserve has done something wrong was printing money out of thin air and talking about Alan Greenspan, the traitor, you know, the Liberty Movement.
[01:48:16.379 --> 01:48:22.141]  It's just boggling, Alex, really, to see Herman Cain at one point talking about how he loves the Constitution.
[01:48:22.581 --> 01:48:24.684]  And then the next point, defending the Federal Reserve.
[01:48:24.684 --> 01:48:28.408]  And really, Alex, I was the only one asking tough questions to Herman Cain.
[01:48:28.408 --> 01:48:30.170]  And I hope I can go to Iowa.
[01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:33.473]  Rick the Adulterer Perry is going to be there at a Christian conference.
[01:48:33.473 --> 01:48:36.957]  I'd like to ask him some real questions.
[01:48:36.957 --> 01:48:41.722]  Well, look, the whole reported adultery thing hasn't been proven.
[01:48:43.564 --> 01:48:46.126]  You can ask them to pay attention.
[01:48:46.126 --> 01:48:50.471]  But I would go with some of the other issues.
[01:48:50.471 --> 01:48:59.379]  I would go after Perry on, hey, why did you support Al Gore for president?
[01:48:59.379 --> 01:49:01.821]  Why did you support Hillarycare?
[01:49:01.821 --> 01:49:05.545]  It's those type of questions that he needs to be put on the hot seat for.
[01:49:05.545 --> 01:49:07.287]  But listen, let's expand on that.
[01:49:08.194 --> 01:49:16.037]  What about Mitt Romney's children, whose Obama's science czar, who openly wants to put chemicals in water to sterilize us, and wants to cut off our resources?
[01:49:16.037 --> 01:49:20.158]  I mean, old Romney is for abortion, disarming the citizens.
[01:49:20.158 --> 01:49:24.860]  He wrote Obamacare, and this is the Republican program.
[01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:37.858]  This is Fox News, and the state wanted Bill O'Reilly, Mr. VAT Tax, to pay off, and National Sales Tax, which Herman Cain is promoting.
[01:49:37.858 --> 01:49:41.401]  But look, Herman Cain is saying, I like Greenspan.
[01:49:41.401 --> 01:49:46.064]  It's Greenspan that put him on as the head there, or got Congress to.
[01:49:47.525 --> 01:49:49.726]  It was Greenspan that got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[01:49:49.726 --> 01:49:51.546]  It was Greenspan that created the derivatives.
[01:49:51.546 --> 01:49:54.067]  It was Greenspan that did all of this.
[01:49:54.067 --> 01:49:57.567]  It was Greenspan that set up the biggest Ponzi scheme bubble.
[01:49:57.567 --> 01:49:59.528]  And Herman Cain knows that.
[01:49:59.528 --> 01:50:02.728]  What do you think, Leo?
[01:50:02.728 --> 01:50:05.969]  You can tell he was uncomfortable while I was asking these questions.
[01:50:05.969 --> 01:50:09.390]  It's just absolutely absurd that here we are again
[01:50:10.502 --> 01:50:16.766]  They're offering someone who is a true insider, as Ron Paul said it best, Alex.
[01:50:16.766 --> 01:50:19.108]  It's just sickening that people are getting conned.
[01:50:19.108 --> 01:50:21.249]  What about when he said Ron Paul was a liar?
[01:50:21.249 --> 01:50:23.971]  And said, I didn't call people who want to audit the Fed stupid.
[01:50:23.971 --> 01:50:25.952]  And then there's the quote in his book calling him stupid.
[01:50:28.579 --> 01:50:30.220]  You can tell he's afraid of Ron Paul.
[01:50:30.220 --> 01:50:31.481]  They're all afraid of Ron Paul.
[01:50:31.481 --> 01:50:33.883]  He's been fighting the feds since the 70s, Alex.
[01:50:33.883 --> 01:50:34.243]  Yes.
[01:50:34.243 --> 01:50:35.143]  Hey, Leo.
[01:50:35.143 --> 01:50:35.664]  Great job.
[01:50:35.664 --> 01:50:38.085]  We'll continue to promote your great videos.
[01:50:38.085 --> 01:50:39.966]  And we really appreciate the work you're doing in there.

[01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:45.510]  Stay with us.
[01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:46.891]  It's Infowars News.
[01:51:00.916 --> 01:51:02.217]  What happened, man?
[01:51:02.217 --> 01:51:06.221]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.

[01:52:03.117 --> 01:52:15.288]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[01:52:15.288 --> 01:52:22.374]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[01:52:22.594 --> 01:52:26.676]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:52:26.676 --> 01:52:28.997]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[01:52:28.997 --> 01:52:33.980]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:34.620]  A $259 value for only $1.99.

[01:53:00.633 --> 01:53:04.895]  Do you live where ice storms, blizzards, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes occur?
[01:53:04.895 --> 01:53:05.795]  Who doesn't?
[01:53:05.795 --> 01:53:06.876]  Well, most of us do.
[01:53:06.876 --> 01:53:10.517]  And when they occur, one of the first things to happen is the power goes out.
[01:53:10.517 --> 01:53:14.479]  When Hurricane Irene hit, over 5 million homes were without power.
[01:53:14.479 --> 01:53:16.680]  Just having light around the house becomes very important.
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:21.405]  Arm yourself the new 50-hour emergency candle in a can.
[01:53:21.405 --> 01:53:22.847]  Just pull the pop-top lid.
[01:53:22.847 --> 01:53:27.572]  The matches are safe inside and light up the candle for 50 hours of continuous light.
[01:53:27.572 --> 01:53:30.015]  The candle and matches are together when you need them the most.
[01:53:30.015 --> 01:53:32.258]  Emergency light that has an indefinite shelf life.
[01:53:32.538 --> 01:53:35.620]  Always ready and won't go dead like batteries.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.901]  50-hour emergency candles are $7.95 each or $4 for $28.
[01:53:37.901 --> 01:53:40.483]  Call toll-free 1-855-485-8555, 855-485-8555 or order online at candlesincans.com.

[01:54:09.577 --> 01:54:12.039]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:54:12.039 --> 01:54:13.580]  Had a little bit of bumpy Skype earlier.
[01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:14.601]  Apologize for that.
[01:54:14.601 --> 01:54:18.524]  We're now audio only here for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:54:18.524 --> 01:54:19.745]  May go back to video later.
[01:54:19.745 --> 01:54:24.929]  I will get more into the huge news now that it's admitted.
[01:54:24.929 --> 01:54:25.770]  We already knew it.
[01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:27.891]  It's in the federal documents.
[01:54:27.891 --> 01:54:33.516]  Dealing with Fast and Furious going back to the Bush administration.
[01:54:34.612 --> 01:54:38.335]  Yeah, it goes back before that as well.
[01:54:38.335 --> 01:54:41.977]  So that's all coming up later in the next hour.
[01:54:41.977 --> 01:54:50.743]  Dr. Steve Pchenik joins us on the Iran situation and the move towards war and more and what other staged events may they pull.
[01:54:50.743 --> 01:54:51.723]  That's all coming up.
[01:54:51.723 --> 01:54:56.827]  But right now, it was great hearing from Julio and the great job he's doing there in Chicago.
[01:54:56.827 --> 01:54:59.388]  Right now, let's go ahead and talk to Phil in Ohio.
[01:54:59.388 --> 01:55:00.169]  Phil, thanks for holding.
[01:55:01.929 --> 01:55:02.669]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:06.811]  First off, Alex, God bless you and yours.
[01:55:06.811 --> 01:55:09.652]  Please stay strong.
[01:55:09.652 --> 01:55:13.794]  America, freedom, and my grandkids need you.
[01:55:13.794 --> 01:55:20.936]  A couple quick things with reference to your San Antonio visit to the Fed.
[01:55:20.936 --> 01:55:29.820]  Unless I'm mistaken, and you obviously can correct me, I would assume that both the Fed building
[01:55:31.249 --> 01:55:44.455]  And, uh, their bills, and even if the security people are private contractors, I would assume it's American tax dollars paying the bills.
[01:55:44.455 --> 01:55:51.638]  Uh, the other thing most important there is currently anti-gun legislation moving through Congress.
[01:55:51.638 --> 01:55:52.519]  It's H.R.
[01:55:52.519 --> 01:55:53.699]  822.
[01:55:53.699 --> 01:55:59.322]  It'd be a great benefit if everybody contacted their rep.
[01:56:00.291 --> 01:56:03.392]  And told them how they felt about that.
[01:56:03.392 --> 01:56:10.113]  The other, I try to listen to you every day, and I may have missed it.
[01:56:10.113 --> 01:56:24.976]  If you have not had some of your duty there, investigate or find out the latest on the deep underground military bases, the Dums,
[01:56:26.506 --> 01:56:32.590]  I'd like to hear it if you can let us know you're going to or whatever.
[01:56:32.590 --> 01:56:35.032]  Anyway, please stay strong.
[01:56:35.032 --> 01:56:36.272]  We need you.
[01:56:36.272 --> 01:56:39.655]  You know, it's funny you bring up deep underground military bases.
[01:56:39.655 --> 01:56:42.397]  I'm going to look into that next weekend.
[01:56:42.397 --> 01:56:44.138]  And that's all I can say here on air.
[01:56:44.138 --> 01:56:46.240]  So an interesting call, sir.
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:50.823]  And really interesting to hear from you on that front, Phil.
[01:56:50.823 --> 01:56:53.124]  We know that hundreds of billions of dollars since the 40s
[01:56:54.807 --> 01:56:54.967]  I think?
[01:57:17.008 --> 01:57:17.308]  I think?
[01:57:47.552 --> 01:57:52.136]  Systems under Bergstrom Airport that go out to Fort Hood and other areas.
[01:57:52.136 --> 01:57:57.000]  I know Bush's ranch was reportedly built on top of one.
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.843]  That's why they bought that property out there outside Waco.
[01:58:00.843 --> 01:58:05.227]  But I only know about that because I had family in Austin in the 50s when some of that was being built.
[01:58:05.227 --> 01:58:08.670]  And I've talked to family in the military that knows about it but won't discuss it.
[01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:12.774]  I mean, they've got underground base snorkels sticking up in South Austin.
[01:58:13.774 --> 01:58:23.338]  Uh, so, uh, I mean, I really, I mean, I should do a whole news report on that, though, for the nightly news soon, okay?
[01:58:23.338 --> 01:58:25.178]  Good to hear from you, and God bless.
[01:58:25.178 --> 01:58:32.861]  Uh, we're gonna come back and go to Michael, then we're gonna go to, uh, Bill, then we're gonna go to Christian, Otter, Kobe.
[01:58:32.861 --> 01:58:37.683]  When I'm done with those calls, I'll get into Fast and Furious, the latest news, and then Dr. Steve Pachinik joining us again.
[01:58:41.348 --> 01:58:44.949]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:03.056 --> 01:59:09.859]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.789 --> 01:59:18.220]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:59:29.931 --> 01:59:32.072]  We turn jeans inside out.

[02:00:17.677 --> 02:00:21.740]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.748 --> 02:00:30.669]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:33.510]  It is Tuesday, the 18th day of October 2011.
[02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:37.451]  And I'm going to be back in Austin tomorrow.
[02:00:37.451 --> 02:00:39.271]  I've got some big guests lined up.
[02:00:39.271 --> 02:00:40.732]  Aaron Dice is going to be hosting the show.
[02:00:40.732 --> 02:00:43.692]  He'll be officially back in the saddle Thursday and Friday.
[02:00:43.692 --> 02:00:53.355]  I am going on location to do an investigation with Jesse Ventura early next weekend through Monday.
[02:00:53.355 --> 02:00:56.556]  So a lot of on-the-road transmissions.
[02:00:57.813 --> 02:01:06.240]  And if I'm able to, I will bring my Skype set up and we'll pop in in between working with Ventura on the road next Monday.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.682]  So we're going to play that by ear.
[02:01:08.682 --> 02:01:10.363]  Dr. Steve Pachinick's coming up.
[02:01:10.363 --> 02:01:12.065]  Big developments in Fast and Furious.
[02:01:12.065 --> 02:01:14.667]  They're admitting now it goes back to the Bush administration.
[02:01:14.667 --> 02:01:17.549]  That's why they can't bring Obama down.
[02:01:17.549 --> 02:01:20.572]  You always wonder why one president won't bring down another president.
[02:01:21.548 --> 02:01:23.369]  My brother and I, we listen to you guys a lot on the podcast.
[02:01:23.369 --> 02:01:24.730]  I've been listening to you guys on the phone.
[02:01:24.730 --> 02:01:26.411]  A couple questions I actually had was that
[02:01:51.266 --> 02:01:54.747]  The whole entire military thing going on down in Mexico.
[02:01:54.747 --> 02:01:56.768]  Now, is our military involved with that?
[02:01:56.768 --> 02:01:59.509]  Or do we have any national army going over there to help out?
[02:01:59.509 --> 02:02:02.230]  Or what's going on?
[02:02:02.230 --> 02:02:08.172]  I forget the number, but yeah, it's in the tens of billions a year in military aid the U.S.
[02:02:08.172 --> 02:02:08.913]  gives Mexico.
[02:02:08.913 --> 02:02:17.396]  Because with them being on the attack at the border, so basically we don't really have our actual national army over there.
[02:02:18.123 --> 02:02:24.306]  We just, very much what, just having our police department take care of it?
[02:02:24.306 --> 02:02:31.250]  Well, most of the police departments are told either take money and basically protect us
[02:02:33.018 --> 02:02:35.420]  More we're going to kill you and your family.
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:49.149]  Down here on the border, and they've had congressional hearings on this, I would say over 50% of the police are active drug smugglers, that is detectives and above, and the other 50% or so, 25%
[02:02:53.379 --> 02:03:05.968]  Turn a blind eye, and the other 25% are so low-level, they're basically just office staff and out writing tickets to keep the lights on in the building.
[02:03:05.968 --> 02:03:12.914]  So, I mean, half the police down here, and that's a conservative estimate, they're constantly getting caught, but then not getting in trouble.
[02:03:12.914 --> 02:03:17.317]  About half the police on the border are serious narcotics traffickers.
[02:03:17.317 --> 02:03:18.938]  Half the sheriffs.
[02:03:18.938 --> 02:03:20.039]  In fact, it's probably more like 75% are.
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:31.469]  In most big cities, any police officer of any level who's in narcotics or detective role is taking money.
[02:03:31.469 --> 02:03:34.212]  But not just for narcotics.
[02:03:34.212 --> 02:03:43.920]  Theft rings, prostitution rings, all these things are made illegal so they can get a cut of them.
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:44.381]  You understand?
[02:03:46.050 --> 02:03:57.357]  And that's why the real mafia cities like Chicago and New York, they don't want the public being armed because they want to be able to up the level of crime and then get even more goods through their criminal workers.
[02:03:57.357 --> 02:04:02.300]  But then also people then beg for more cops, so there's more cops to boss you around like they are in New York.
[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:09.985]  I mean, New York, they just smoke cigarettes, cigars, lounge around, and just look at the public with absolute hate.
[02:04:09.985 --> 02:04:12.847]  You are seen as the lowest bottom feeding trash.
[02:04:13.668 --> 02:04:15.877]  And the police just stand around with giant pot bellies.
[02:04:15.877 --> 02:04:18.829]  It's total victory over America, total evil.
[02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:22.871]  Yeah, it is kind of funny seeing some of these cops on TV.
[02:04:22.871 --> 02:04:26.453]  It's like, I don't know, where did you pass the police exam, you know?
[02:04:26.453 --> 02:04:27.353]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:04:27.353 --> 02:04:31.695]  I've talked to Austin cops who've been up in New York and asked for directions.
[02:04:31.695 --> 02:04:34.096]  And they'll say, do I look like a phone book?
[02:04:34.096 --> 02:04:35.136]  Get out of here!
[02:04:35.136 --> 02:04:37.257]  And they'll say, oh, you want something?
[02:04:37.257 --> 02:04:38.038]  Oh, you do?
[02:04:38.038 --> 02:04:39.138]  I'll split your head.
[02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:41.439]  They'll do it right in front of families with kids.
[02:04:41.439 --> 02:04:43.940]  Now, some of the cops in New York are friendly and nice.
[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:44.780]  But I'd say they're about 30% now.
[02:04:46.161 --> 02:04:52.164]  And if you see all these videos, it's the white shirt cops, the political cops that are doing the beating.
[02:04:52.164 --> 02:04:56.526]  And I mean, they are just the ultimate criminal thugs with a badge and a uniform.
[02:04:56.526 --> 02:04:57.326]  It's North Korea.
[02:04:57.326 --> 02:04:58.307]  They would love North Korea.
[02:05:00.922 --> 02:05:03.463]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.

[02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:27.232]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:05:27.232 --> 02:05:29.574]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.

[02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:16.194]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:06:17.222 --> 02:06:21.904]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:21.904 --> 02:06:34.668]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:06:34.668 --> 02:06:41.931]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:06:42.631 --> 02:06:52.997]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:07:01.949 --> 02:07:06.653]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:07:06.653 --> 02:07:13.080]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:15.362]  Number one, study the past.
[02:07:15.362 --> 02:07:17.764]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:07:17.764 --> 02:07:21.467]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:07:22.597 --> 02:07:25.679]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:07:25.679 --> 02:07:29.522]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:07:29.522 --> 02:07:34.566]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:07:34.566 --> 02:07:38.588]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:07:38.588 --> 02:07:41.991]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:07:41.991 --> 02:07:45.874]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:46.474 --> 02:07:51.397]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[02:07:56.020 --> 02:08:01.983]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:08:01.983 --> 02:08:07.486]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.687 --> 02:08:15.150]  We are racing through your phone calls right now.
[02:08:15.150 --> 02:08:17.251]  Ahead of Dr. Steve Pachenik joining us.
[02:08:17.251 --> 02:08:20.434]  Big developments, the biggest yet in Fast and Furious.
[02:08:20.434 --> 02:08:23.356]  The admission that it goes back to the Bush administration.
[02:08:23.356 --> 02:08:27.139]  I know you've heard that here for months, but now it's breaking.
[02:08:27.139 --> 02:08:31.542]  It didn't really break here, it only breaks when the mainstream dinosaur says so.
[02:08:31.542 --> 02:08:37.046]  Continuing here, we'll also get into some other news, but let's go to Bill in Connecticut.
[02:08:37.046 --> 02:08:38.567]  Bill, welcome.
[02:08:38.567 --> 02:08:39.268]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:08:40.663 --> 02:08:42.164]  I have four quick points.
[02:08:42.164 --> 02:08:44.805]  I'll try to be brief on each one.
[02:08:44.805 --> 02:08:49.626]  I took my D-90 camera down to Zuccotti Park about two weeks ago.
[02:08:49.626 --> 02:08:55.928]  And my last question, I wanted to interview people and see what their awareness was of the Federal Reserve.
[02:08:55.928 --> 02:09:01.590]  But I snuck the question, and it was my last question, and I asked it in very general terms.
[02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:05.751]  I would say, what are your thoughts on the Federal Reserve?
[02:09:05.751 --> 02:09:08.972]  And three out of the five people that I interviewed
[02:09:09.904 --> 02:09:15.965]  We're aware of it, and they all indicated that they wanted to shut it down.
[02:09:15.965 --> 02:09:23.227]  And when you would look at these people, you would think, I didn't think they'd have any awareness at all, but they truly did.
[02:09:23.227 --> 02:09:26.747]  So that sort of took me back a bit.
[02:09:26.747 --> 02:09:32.589]  And by the way, I uploaded your prison plan at that video.
[02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:38.950]  The other point is the gentleman saying he didn't like you saying that there were Nazis within the police department.
[02:09:40.171 --> 02:09:55.412]  Well, back in, and you know this, back in 1945, Truman allowed the CIA to bring in what he thought at the time was a couple of hundred Nazis, but as it turned out it was closer to 20,000.
[02:09:56.829 --> 02:10:17.592]  That infiltrated not only the CIA, but our universities, corporations, infiltrated our... Yeah, Operation Paperclip, and my grandfather would tell me about this just in his work as a leasehound, but he would be in and around military bases a lot of times in New Mexico or Arizona or West Texas.
[02:10:18.473 --> 02:10:21.595]  There's nowhere to eat or get gas but at military bases.
[02:10:21.595 --> 02:10:25.598]  So he would say, yeah, there's all these German officers there.
[02:10:25.598 --> 02:10:28.019]  He would tell me those stories before he died.
[02:10:28.019 --> 02:10:29.400]  But yeah, you're right.
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:34.684]  Tens of thousands of them to run NASA, to run the CIA, Klaus Barbie.
[02:10:36.192 --> 02:10:36.993]  All of it.
[02:10:36.993 --> 02:10:46.458]  And then they would have these made for TV things about Nazi hunters and tracking this guy or tracking that guy or burning somebody who couldn't be proven to be a Nazi.
[02:10:46.458 --> 02:10:53.943]  And it's because the Nazis had stolen what would be trillions today in art and gold and diamonds and money.
[02:10:53.943 --> 02:10:57.165]  And so they paid off the West and they basically came in out of the cold
[02:10:57.865 --> 02:11:00.427]  With the OSS and then CIA.
[02:11:00.427 --> 02:11:06.090]  But I couldn't even exactly understand what that caller was saying an hour ago.
[02:11:06.090 --> 02:11:10.793]  When he was asking about cops being Nazis and saying, I bet you don't want to come to Jersey.
[02:11:10.793 --> 02:11:13.614]  I bet it's nice there in Texas.
[02:11:13.614 --> 02:11:16.236]  And I wasn't even calling cops Nazis.
[02:11:16.236 --> 02:11:24.401]  I was saying, America is, the government policies, no one can deny, more and more resemble an authoritarian state.
[02:11:25.401 --> 02:11:31.842]  Uh, and instead of just calling it North Korea, sometimes I say it's Nazi-like or it's Soviet-like.
[02:11:31.842 --> 02:11:35.683]  And people send me emails saying, now, communism and fascism are two different things.
[02:11:35.683 --> 02:11:36.623]  No, they're not.
[02:11:36.623 --> 02:11:41.704]  I know they're different in the textbook, but they're all authoritarian in my book.
[02:11:41.704 --> 02:11:49.685]  It's different flavors of the same, you know, you could paint a ball-peen hammer green or black, still, if somebody beats you in the head with it, it has the same effect.
[02:11:49.685 --> 02:11:53.006]  Uh, so did you get from what he was saying that I was bad?
[02:11:53.006 --> 02:11:54.006]  Uh, because I, I,
[02:11:55.279 --> 02:11:58.480]  I couldn't understand it.
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:03.423]  Was that the CIA is coming in and directing the police force.
[02:12:03.423 --> 02:12:13.047]  And so my point to support your point is, yeah, and the CIA, they had been infiltrated in the 40s.
[02:12:13.047 --> 02:12:23.011]  And you would have to assume that that's still happening up until the present, because I've never heard of anyone saying, we've gotten rid of all the Nazis out of our CIA.
[02:12:23.011 --> 02:12:24.672]  In other words, they're still there.
[02:12:26.005 --> 02:12:29.528]  Um, can you follow me on that point?
[02:12:29.528 --> 02:12:30.909]  Well, I've actually studied this.
[02:12:30.909 --> 02:12:43.578]  They're pretty much all dead, but up until the 80s, they were still using Nazi officers to blow up aircraft in Latin America to kill people for assassinations.
[02:12:43.578 --> 02:12:47.961]  Klaus Barbie set up and ran death squads.
[02:12:47.961 --> 02:12:49.342]  Uh, the Texas, um,
[02:12:50.410 --> 02:13:00.141]  Lieutenant Governor reportedly worked with him and he said that brought to his attention David Dewhurst and he won't talk about it.
[02:13:00.141 --> 02:13:05.747]  But the point is the people running our government liked Nazis.
[02:13:05.747 --> 02:13:09.612]  I don't even see it as Nazis took over America.
[02:13:09.612 --> 02:13:11.434]  Eugenics and those ideas
[02:13:13.038 --> 02:13:20.271]  We're starting in England, popularized in the US, and the Rockefellers openly funded Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[02:13:20.271 --> 02:13:22.735]  This is all mainline, you know, mainline history.
[02:13:22.735 --> 02:13:23.456]  It's not debatable.
[02:13:24.719 --> 02:13:28.661]  And then Bill Gates' dad was involved in all of it.
[02:13:28.661 --> 02:13:36.365]  So Bill Gates was chosen to then be this new front company to then promise that he'd donate the money just as IBM had given almost all its money to eugenics.
[02:13:36.365 --> 02:13:39.546]  Thomas Watson and the Hall of Earth Machines would cover it in Endgame.
[02:13:39.546 --> 02:13:41.667]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:13:41.667 --> 02:13:43.248]  And so it isn't that the Nazis took over.
[02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:44.209]  They were coming home.
[02:13:45.149 --> 02:13:49.131]  Uh, they were coming home to a place that loved them and cared about them.
[02:13:49.131 --> 02:13:55.275]  Uh, it's just that the globalists had decided, you know, the King of England had to step down because he'd been too big of a Nazi.
[02:13:55.275 --> 02:14:00.558]  The decision was made to not let the Nazis actually link up with the U.S.
[02:14:00.558 --> 02:14:02.019]  They tried to hire Smedley Butler.
[02:14:02.019 --> 02:14:03.760]  He blew the whistle on it.
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:09.163]  So there were different factions, but there was a fascist Nazi faction in the U.S.
[02:14:09.163 --> 02:14:10.724]  Do you see my point?
[02:14:10.724 --> 02:14:13.326]  Yeah, but, but I would think that there,
[02:14:14.147 --> 02:14:16.549]  Would at least be a thread there.
[02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:39.223]  You know, and even going back to Prescott Bush and his... I don't know what, how much involvement is true or not true, but... No, he was the head Nazi agent, and Brown Brother Harriman, and with the different shipping lines they had, and construction lines, and everything, and he was the main Nazi agent in the United States.
[02:14:39.223 --> 02:14:40.504]  And he got away with it all.
[02:14:41.084 --> 02:14:57.366]  Because he set up the, what's that thing where they get the, I'm having one of those moments, what's the thing, the USO, what's the thing where they send the Hollywood folks and the people, you know, Bob Hope to do the musical acts and things for the trips?
[02:14:57.366 --> 02:14:57.426]  USO.
[02:14:58.905 --> 02:14:59.905]  Yeah, yeah, USO.
[02:14:59.905 --> 02:15:08.788]  The point is Prescott set that up as a political cover as World War II was starting because it was being discussed that he was a Nazi and they were having hearings about it.
[02:15:08.788 --> 02:15:11.609]  And they said, look, he runs the thing for the troops.
[02:15:11.609 --> 02:15:13.049]  There's no way.
[02:15:13.049 --> 02:15:15.230]  I mean, this is even the London Guardian now.
[02:15:15.230 --> 02:15:17.810]  You know, years after we reported it, they, quote, broke it.
[02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:21.931]  Kind of like Fox News is breaking that Bush had similar programs.
[02:15:21.931 --> 02:15:23.652]  I guess it's OK, Obama did this.
[02:15:24.632 --> 02:15:26.373]  Because, you know, it's a long-term program.
[02:15:26.373 --> 02:15:29.773]  But no, I think it's more than a string going back.
[02:15:29.773 --> 02:15:34.575]  It's a giant cable going back, and I totally agree with you.
[02:15:34.575 --> 02:15:38.136]  And one last point, Alex, because I know you're going to move on.
[02:15:38.136 --> 02:15:39.696]  You had a call a couple of weeks ago.
[02:15:39.696 --> 02:15:43.617]  He said, Alex, I don't like you using sarcasm.
[02:15:43.617 --> 02:15:45.858]  And I thought, you know, how ridiculous.
[02:15:45.858 --> 02:15:47.258]  Number one, you're very good at it.
[02:15:47.913 --> 02:15:58.041]  And number two, if we allow the globalists to take away our humor and most importantly, our peace of mind, then we've lost everything.
[02:15:58.041 --> 02:16:06.968]  And I thought in particular, when you were doing imitations of Bill Gates and Al Gore, it was like dead on.
[02:16:06.968 --> 02:16:09.169]  It was unbelievable.
[02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:16.495]  And I guess my last point tied to the humor part, I thought it would be great if you could have Lionel back on again, because the two of you seem to
[02:16:17.931 --> 02:16:21.313]  That's a good idea.
[02:16:21.313 --> 02:16:29.280]  Let's call Lionel, Jaren, and get him on for an hour next week, maybe third hour, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday with his best material.
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:34.864]  He's a great syndicated radio host in his own right and just an amazing comedian.
[02:16:34.864 --> 02:16:37.567]  We'll definitely get Lionel back on next week if he can do it.
[02:16:37.567 --> 02:16:38.588]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:16:38.588 --> 02:16:39.208]  Thank you for the call.
[02:16:43.251 --> 02:16:51.054]  Robert, listening on KGM, 1630 AM in Texas.
[02:16:51.054 --> 02:16:56.877]  Here in just a moment, and then we'll get to Christian, Otter, and Kobe before I get our guest on.
[02:16:56.877 --> 02:17:01.879]  But I've got to hit the new Fast and Furious and a couple other news items we haven't covered yet here.
[02:17:01.879 --> 02:17:06.421]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Texas, listening to 1630 AM.
[02:17:06.421 --> 02:17:08.762]  What city are you in, Robert?
[02:17:08.762 --> 02:17:10.223]  Gallup.
[02:17:10.223 --> 02:17:11.543]  Okay, good to have you on board with us.
[02:17:11.543 --> 02:17:12.464]  What's on your mind today, sir?
[02:17:13.542 --> 02:17:23.691]  Okay, a week ago I was down there when you came to the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas.
[02:17:23.691 --> 02:17:38.583]  I was approached by an FBI provocateur and I wanted to explain this to people and I'm afraid they'd call me on my cell phone and it scared me to death.
[02:17:38.583 --> 02:17:40.505]  This man had a canister
[02:17:41.445 --> 02:17:59.824]  Approximately six inches tall and probably three to four inches in diameter and said, you know, that, you know, he would give this canister to me and I could throw it at the bank and it would explode.
[02:17:59.824 --> 02:18:02.527]  And this is scaring me to death.
[02:18:03.291 --> 02:18:04.872]  Well, this happens everywhere.
[02:18:04.872 --> 02:18:10.694]  Look, look, look, it was probably, probably, well, they do have FBI, but they're using the Army for this.
[02:18:10.694 --> 02:18:14.215]  But the Army was on our side three years ago and leaked that this happened.
[02:18:14.215 --> 02:18:18.437]  So I'm going to skip this break right now because this is so important with you, sir.
[02:18:18.437 --> 02:18:21.378]  And I wish that you would have come to me while I was there.
[02:18:21.378 --> 02:18:27.620]  Perhaps you came when the demonstration was going on for a few days after I left there in Dallas against the private Federal Reserve.
[02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:28.541]  But this is standard.
[02:18:29.511 --> 02:18:30.892]  I see it on my message boards.
[02:18:30.892 --> 02:18:31.932]  I see it on YouTube.
[02:18:31.932 --> 02:18:33.893]  Hey, contact me.
[02:18:33.893 --> 02:18:35.134]  I'm in Miami.
[02:18:35.134 --> 02:18:36.154]  I just got out of the army.
[02:18:36.154 --> 02:18:37.295]  I want to overthrow the U.S.
[02:18:37.295 --> 02:18:37.995]  government.
[02:18:37.995 --> 02:18:39.376]  You go look at their dummy channel.
[02:18:39.376 --> 02:18:40.696]  It's always the same.
[02:18:40.696 --> 02:18:48.520]  So a lot of times they're just trying to find somebody who's mentally unstable, who they can then set up and say that they threw the canister.
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:51.702]  And that now you're saying they're calling you on your cell phone.
[02:18:52.762 --> 02:18:57.704]  And yes, when I say it's dangerous to go against the Federal Reserve, these are the terrorists.
[02:18:57.704 --> 02:18:59.524]  These are the people that run America.
[02:18:59.524 --> 02:19:00.925]  This is the globalists.
[02:19:00.925 --> 02:19:02.625]  This is the hijackers.
[02:19:02.625 --> 02:19:09.467]  So tell me, when were you there, exactly what happened, and then get into the cell phone part.
[02:19:09.467 --> 02:19:15.069]  Friday, when you were there, a week ago Friday, when you were... I came down to see you.
[02:19:15.069 --> 02:19:18.330]  I'm a big fan of yours, and I came down
[02:19:21.809 --> 02:19:24.150]  To listen to you speak.
[02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:29.571]  And I was walking down the sidewalk, and this man approached me.
[02:19:29.571 --> 02:19:31.472]  He was about roughly my size.
[02:19:31.472 --> 02:19:34.413]  I had to get in his face to get him away from me.
[02:19:34.413 --> 02:19:37.873]  I mean, this man, I'm 64 years old.
[02:19:37.873 --> 02:19:44.495]  And, you know, he was basically threatening me, take this, take this, throw this at the Federal Reserve Bank.
[02:19:44.495 --> 02:19:47.036]  I said, I'm not taking anything.
[02:19:47.036 --> 02:19:48.556]  I said, I know what you are.
[02:19:48.556 --> 02:19:50.317]  I said, you're an FBI.
[02:19:51.731 --> 02:19:52.732]  Provocateur.
[02:19:52.732 --> 02:19:53.792]  Yes, you had just got there.
[02:19:53.792 --> 02:19:55.453]  5'7", 5'8", brown hair, probably in his early 40's.
[02:20:19.745 --> 02:20:24.427]  Uh, he wore wireframe glasses.
[02:20:24.427 --> 02:20:27.649]  And he was saying, take this, take this, please continue.
[02:20:27.649 --> 02:20:28.629]  Yeah, okay.
[02:20:28.629 --> 02:20:31.471]  He told me, he says, you have a cell phone, don't you?
[02:20:31.471 --> 02:20:33.471]  I said, yes, I have a cell phone.
[02:20:33.471 --> 02:20:35.392]  He said, I'll give you a number.
[02:20:35.392 --> 02:20:43.076]  Once you throw it over there by the Federal Reserve Bank, he says, you can punch the number in and it will explode.
[02:20:46.069 --> 02:20:48.171]  No, I'm not, but I'm an older person.
[02:20:48.171 --> 02:20:48.811]  I'm 64 years old and I'm white.
[02:21:10.799 --> 02:21:12.461]  Man, I wish you would have come over and got me.
[02:21:12.461 --> 02:21:15.164]  I would have... Citizens arrested that guy.
[02:21:15.164 --> 02:21:18.568]  I would have pounced on him and made the cops come over immediately.
[02:21:18.568 --> 02:21:20.891]  The minute I would... Police, police!
[02:21:20.891 --> 02:21:21.892]  I'm not saying you did wrong.
[02:21:21.892 --> 02:21:24.675]  You don't know what... You never think this is going to happen to you.
[02:21:24.675 --> 02:21:30.502]  You know, my thing is I've been sitting there signing DVDs at a movie theater where I would go give a speech.
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:38.142]  And during the movie, I'd be out there signing DVDs, and it's always the same cop walks up, hey, let's attack the police department and blow it up.
[02:21:38.142 --> 02:21:43.724]  And I'll go, you're a cop, get out of here, and I'd get the security and follow him out to be an unmarked police car.
[02:21:43.724 --> 02:21:53.408]  Or I'd try to build a veteran, a memorial house, you know, his wife, daughter, whatever, and they were trying to, you know, take his property, and the police would come and try that.
[02:21:54.128 --> 02:21:56.129]  And it's just always the same.
[02:21:56.129 --> 02:21:58.190]  It never ends with these people.
[02:21:58.190 --> 02:22:01.411]  And this is how they set folks up across the country.
[02:22:01.411 --> 02:22:04.892]  And it's just so disgusting that they do it.
[02:22:04.892 --> 02:22:08.073]  And they usually find mentally ill people they can set up.
[02:22:08.073 --> 02:22:10.334]  Okay, so he comes up and he says, I'll give you this cell phone.
[02:22:10.334 --> 02:22:12.175]  Continue.
[02:22:12.175 --> 02:22:12.875]  Okay.
[02:22:12.875 --> 02:22:16.977]  He said, he asked me, he says, do you have a cell phone?
[02:22:16.977 --> 02:22:17.877]  I said, yes, I do.
[02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:25.129]  And he said, well, all I have to do, you have to throw this over there against the building.
[02:22:25.129 --> 02:22:25.630]  And he said,
[02:22:26.346 --> 02:22:33.328]  I will give you a number to punch in on your cell phone and it will explode when you punch in the number.
[02:22:33.328 --> 02:22:39.591]  Yeah, you would have thrown the dummy thing over there and then it could show the belief and then the intent by you triggering it.
[02:22:39.591 --> 02:22:40.751]  That would be a record of it.
[02:22:40.751 --> 02:22:48.094]  Total, total FBI or ADL or Army and just wicked criminal.
[02:22:48.094 --> 02:22:49.054]  So how did this end?
[02:22:51.129 --> 02:22:59.577]  Well I had to get in this this man's face because this man basically was almost forcing me to do this.
[02:22:59.577 --> 02:23:06.023]  He says you're an old man and I'll kill you and all this kind of stuff and I said wait a minute I said
[02:23:06.792 --> 02:23:11.334]  We're going to have a war right here on the sidewalk if you don't get out of my face.
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:30.861]  And he even told his jailmates that.
[02:23:30.861 --> 02:23:33.343]  That's what they do to army officers, how they set him up.
[02:23:33.343 --> 02:23:35.204]  Wow, I wish you'd have got me, man.
[02:23:35.204 --> 02:23:40.868]  I would have held that person down and I would have got the police over there.
[02:23:40.868 --> 02:23:42.309]  Unbelievable.
[02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:45.171]  So, please continue.
[02:23:45.171 --> 02:23:46.012]  Okay.
[02:23:46.012 --> 02:23:52.016]  They have called me two to three times on my cell phone.
[02:23:52.016 --> 02:23:55.518]  They have my number, so, you know, I know that they
[02:23:57.782 --> 02:23:59.163]  Monitor our phone calls.
[02:23:59.163 --> 02:24:02.645]  I know they're monitoring this phone call that I'm making to you.
[02:24:02.645 --> 02:24:04.246]  I'm scared to death.
[02:24:04.246 --> 02:24:05.026]  Well, don't be scared.
[02:24:05.026 --> 02:24:06.187]  These are criminals.
[02:24:06.187 --> 02:24:07.728]  They might even be foreign nationals.
[02:24:07.728 --> 02:24:08.889]  I know that.
[02:24:08.889 --> 02:24:11.450]  Listen, sir, they're doing this because they're weak.
[02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:15.773]  They're doing this because we're identifying the private Federal Reserve that set all this up.
[02:24:15.773 --> 02:24:16.113]  Okay?
[02:24:16.113 --> 02:24:16.974]  These are terrorists.
[02:24:17.794 --> 02:24:27.362]  They haven't killed me yet, okay, because number one, I pray to God and I have protection because of that and people pray for me because we know God's real.
[02:24:27.362 --> 02:24:29.744]  But also because they don't want to turn me into a martyr.
[02:24:29.744 --> 02:24:40.333]  They wanted to intimidate you into throwing that over there and then detonating it or it might have just been a fake bomb to say on the news, you know, that you were a terrorist or whatever so they could demonize me.
[02:24:41.073 --> 02:24:45.978]  And I had a weird feeling going to that Dallas one, but I just said, I'm doing it, that there'd be a provocateur at action.
[02:24:45.978 --> 02:24:50.922]  In fact, I don't even want to get into it, but I had in my mind's eye something like that might happen in Dallas specifically.
[02:24:50.922 --> 02:24:54.325]  I think I even told you, Richard, that they might pull something like that off.
[02:24:54.325 --> 02:24:57.908]  That's standard procedure in the 60s for these guys.
[02:24:57.908 --> 02:25:01.191]  But by the grace of God, he was unable to get you or others to do it.
[02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:06.814]  Also, they can do this to people just to get stories going so people are scared.
[02:25:06.814 --> 02:25:08.994]  The answer is protest the Fed more.
[02:25:08.994 --> 02:25:12.395]  I mean, you know, they're trying to shut down our YouTube channel right now.
[02:25:12.395 --> 02:25:13.975]  The answer is don't back down.
[02:25:13.975 --> 02:25:17.956]  So you didn't give them your number, but they're calling you.
[02:25:17.956 --> 02:25:21.377]  I did not give them my number, but they know my telephone number.
[02:25:21.377 --> 02:25:22.477]  They knew who I was.
[02:25:22.477 --> 02:25:23.858]  They called me by name.
[02:25:23.858 --> 02:25:25.998]  They said, Robert.
[02:25:26.551 --> 02:25:31.694]  And this man... Robert, what have you been involved in in your past?
[02:25:31.694 --> 02:25:33.955]  What groups?
[02:25:33.955 --> 02:25:35.455]  None whatsoever.
[02:25:35.455 --> 02:25:37.696]  I mean, you know, I listen to your show.
[02:25:37.696 --> 02:25:41.478]  I've been listening to your show for approximately two and a half years.
[02:25:41.478 --> 02:25:44.620]  Well, listen, they may have run your plate when you got there.
[02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:48.862]  We had some really creepy guys pull up and kind of menace me, but I just went ahead and went over to them.
[02:25:48.862 --> 02:25:50.343]  If they were going to do it, then I was ready.
[02:25:51.403 --> 02:25:51.643]  I don't
[02:26:11.084 --> 02:26:12.525]  I'm not going to live in fear to these people.
[02:26:12.525 --> 02:26:14.107]  I am not giving in to it.
[02:26:14.107 --> 02:26:16.469]  I'm going 110% against their evil.
[02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:17.390]  They are weak.
[02:26:17.390 --> 02:26:18.891]  That's why they use fear.
[02:26:18.891 --> 02:26:22.294]  Look, you need to go ahead and call the police.
[02:26:22.294 --> 02:26:24.676]  You need to give us your number, your name.
[02:26:24.676 --> 02:26:27.058]  You need to go ahead and say, listen, this guy did this.
[02:26:27.058 --> 02:26:29.520]  You need to get the surveillance camera stuff.
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:33.003]  You need to go down to the Dallas police and tell them what's happening.
[02:26:33.003 --> 02:26:34.885]  What does the number come up when they call you?
[02:26:36.525 --> 02:26:43.869]  Uh, it says unknown, or wait a minute, something like that, unknown, something like that on my cell phone.
[02:26:43.869 --> 02:26:46.551]  And then what do they say when they call you?
[02:26:46.551 --> 02:26:51.613]  Uh, you didn't do what we wanted you to do, we're gonna get you.
[02:26:51.613 --> 02:26:52.474]  Things like this.
[02:26:56.229 --> 02:27:03.675]  Well, all you do is, you go in, give us your name and number, and then make sure you save it, Jaren, for when I get back.
[02:27:03.675 --> 02:27:07.358]  Put it in a file under Federal Reserve on the computer place.
[02:27:07.358 --> 02:27:09.439]  We've had infiltrators, we've had it all as well.
[02:27:09.439 --> 02:27:12.182]  They make up wild stories of stuff you've done to them.
[02:27:12.182 --> 02:27:14.423]  They'll pose as talk show hosts, move into your town.
[02:27:14.423 --> 02:27:16.085]  I mean, can you imagine my life?
[02:27:16.085 --> 02:27:18.066]  It's 24-7.
[02:27:18.066 --> 02:27:21.269]  But, again, they're weak, they're evil, they're going to hell, they know it.
[02:27:21.909 --> 02:27:25.670]  I would go to the Dallas Police and just be, hey, you need to check the surveillance tapes.
[02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:26.510]  I've been real scared.
[02:27:26.510 --> 02:27:27.670]  They've been calling me.
[02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:29.291]  They were telling me this canister.
[02:27:29.291 --> 02:27:38.193]  They'll have surveillance footage of that in that surrounding area, and you'll know they're in on it if they don't do something about it.
[02:27:38.193 --> 02:27:43.914]  But this is just standard, how they intimidated you, what they did.
[02:27:43.914 --> 02:27:47.455]  But, man, why didn't you come over and get me?
[02:27:47.455 --> 02:27:48.816]  How did it end?
[02:27:48.816 --> 02:27:49.676]  Let's finish the story.
[02:27:50.669 --> 02:27:54.190]  Okay, how it ended was, I got in this man's face.
[02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:56.251]  I told him, I said, I'm an old man.
[02:27:56.251 --> 02:27:59.432]  And I said, I will beat your butt.
[02:27:59.432 --> 02:28:01.332]  And that was exactly what I told the man.
[02:28:01.332 --> 02:28:03.953]  I said, you know, I said, get away from me.
[02:28:03.953 --> 02:28:06.214]  I said, I know what you are.
[02:28:06.214 --> 02:28:09.215]  I said, I think you're an FBI provocateur.
[02:28:09.215 --> 02:28:12.636]  And I said, please get away from me now.
[02:28:12.636 --> 02:28:17.197]  And, you know, he got mad and started cursing me and calling me names.
[02:28:17.197 --> 02:28:18.598]  Did anybody else witness this?
[02:28:19.558 --> 02:28:20.792]  Yes, I have a witness.
[02:28:21.812 --> 02:28:24.154]  Matter of fact, I have two witnesses.
[02:28:24.154 --> 02:28:24.494]  Yeah, I know.
[02:28:24.494 --> 02:28:26.635]  They're good friends of mine.
[02:28:52.733 --> 02:28:53.874]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:28:53.874 --> 02:28:55.737]  So, we've only got a minute and a half left.
[02:28:55.737 --> 02:28:57.819]  How did this end?
[02:28:57.819 --> 02:29:00.762]  Well, he just basically walked away.
[02:29:00.762 --> 02:29:04.867]  You know, when I told him, no, I'm going to get on you.
[02:29:04.867 --> 02:29:07.830]  I'm going to fight you if you don't get away from me.
[02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:10.793]  He basically got away from me and stopped.
[02:29:11.816 --> 02:29:14.438]  Listen, listen, this happened to me.
[02:29:14.438 --> 02:29:16.179]  Mike Hanson's a witness.
[02:29:16.179 --> 02:29:29.066]  We're in the woods trying to film a Brooksville, Florida, FEMA takeover drill, and a guy jumps out of the woods and starts setting things on fire, and I had to physically stop him from doing it, and then it turned out he was with the U.S.
[02:29:29.066 --> 02:29:29.886]  Army.
[02:29:29.886 --> 02:29:31.247]  I mean, they'll do this in a minute.
[02:29:31.247 --> 02:29:34.288]  Wow, we're going to get your name, get your number.
[02:29:34.288 --> 02:29:34.769]  You know what?
[02:29:34.769 --> 02:29:35.089]  Stay there.
[02:29:35.089 --> 02:29:35.989]  I want to hear the rest of this.
[02:29:35.989 --> 02:29:38.431]  We've got the Chinook coming up, but I've got to hear the rest of this.
[02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:54.192]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.192 --> 02:30:02.016]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.598 --> 02:31:01.778]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:01.778 --> 02:31:08.721]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.721 --> 02:31:11.262]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.262 --> 02:31:16.644]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:16.644 --> 02:31:19.685]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:19.685 --> 02:31:22.006]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:28.248]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.248 --> 02:31:28.688]  In fact,
[02:31:28.968 --> 02:31:31.630]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:37.414]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.414 --> 02:31:39.055]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.055 --> 02:31:40.356]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.356 --> 02:31:43.038]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.038 --> 02:31:47.260]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.260 --> 02:31:51.884]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[02:32:15.078 --> 02:32:22.243]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[02:32:22.463 --> 02:32:26.568]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[02:32:26.568 --> 02:32:28.910]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.

[02:33:06.903 --> 02:33:07.905]  I think so.
[02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:33.463]  Okay, Dr. Steve Pchenik popping back in to finish up what he was talking about Friday, and I'm going to pose just a few simple questions for him in order and try to get his analysis on it.
[02:33:33.463 --> 02:33:36.006]  But Robert has called in.
[02:33:36.006 --> 02:33:42.473]  He's saying he has witnesses, and I wanted to finish up on the story of right as I arrive at the Federal Reserve,
[02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:59.646]  To about 400 people, not this Friday, but the Friday before last, to protest the private Federal Reserve, 45-year-old white male, brown hair, wired glasses was saying, throw this canister at the building, use this cell phone to detonate it, or I'm going to beat you up.
[02:34:01.856 --> 02:34:05.738]  Sounds like a classic, just crazy provocateur action.
[02:34:05.738 --> 02:34:09.059]  And then, now they're calling his cell phone threatening him.
[02:34:09.059 --> 02:34:27.185]  So sir, you get with your other witnesses, your friends, you go into the Dallas Police Department, with your witnesses, you say we want to see the surveillance tape, we want you to go after this guy, and you know at the time we were all shocked by it and now they're calling me, and you get them to get the phone records, they can actually uncloak those numbers.
[02:34:27.845 --> 02:34:35.647]  And of course, they'll probably end up saying they don't want to investigate it because it's the FBI doing it or some other miscreant organization.
[02:34:35.647 --> 02:34:43.149]  But again, why didn't you come up to me when this happened to you, Robert?
[02:34:43.149 --> 02:34:47.950]  Alex, I tried to get to you and there were so many people around you that I could not get to you.
[02:34:47.950 --> 02:34:52.691]  And I wanted to tell you straight out what had just happened to me.
[02:34:52.691 --> 02:34:56.492]  Did the guy stir you off after you told him you were going to stomp him?
[02:34:57.386 --> 02:34:58.327]  Yeah, he did.
[02:35:13.912 --> 02:35:21.756]  A key interstate highway route system was a martial law continuity of government drill.
[02:35:21.756 --> 02:35:38.706]  So I get to Brooksville, this is in my film Police State 2 The Takeover, year 2000, and I'm just friendly, and a guy who'd been out, we were building a memorial church for the Branch Davidians, who I thought was a cop and who acted real weird and was always trying to stir stuff up, looked like a military type, really good shape, but looked like a special forces type.
[02:35:39.506 --> 02:35:41.667]  And, uh, I was always trying to stir stuff up.
[02:35:41.667 --> 02:35:45.327]  This guy in the middle of nowhere shows up when we're there talking to locals.
[02:35:45.327 --> 02:35:53.049]  The locals, it's all on video, say, yeah, the Army's come to our door in Brooksville, it's all on video, in the film, and has told us not to talk to you.
[02:35:53.049 --> 02:36:00.331]  So then I'm sitting there outside the local airfield at night trying to film it, and this guy steps out of the bushes and starts lighting things on fire.
[02:36:00.331 --> 02:36:01.651]  And I'm going, what are you doing putting it out?
[02:36:01.651 --> 02:36:03.652]  And he's going, come on, let's burn everything down.
[02:36:03.652 --> 02:36:08.353]  And I had to tell him and grab him, and I said, listen, I know you think you're tough, but I'm about to really hurt you bad.
[02:36:09.033 --> 02:36:11.776]  And then he scurried off and later found out he was with the Army.
[02:36:11.776 --> 02:36:12.817]  But I mean, the U.S.
[02:36:12.817 --> 02:36:17.761]  Army, because I wanted to videotape him, was ready to burn down Brooksville and put me in prison for it!
[02:36:18.721 --> 02:36:43.421]  I mean, again, this country is so far gone, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot describe to you, and I know there's good people in the military as well, you know, like Anthony Schaefer exposing this is a fraud, and the head of the Bin Laden unit coming out with the Iran situation saying it's a fraud, and all these countless people, and the head of the Bush administration's unit studying the Persians has come out, she said it was a fraud, and you've got all these other people coming out,
[02:36:43.561 --> 02:36:44.081]  I don't care.
[02:37:05.509 --> 02:37:06.110]  You know what?
[02:37:06.110 --> 02:37:07.191]  I'm not living in fear.
[02:37:07.191 --> 02:37:07.632]  I don't care.
[02:37:07.632 --> 02:37:10.095]  I'm not a cowardly piece of trash like them.
[02:37:10.095 --> 02:37:10.856]  And that's the end of it.
[02:37:10.856 --> 02:37:12.098]  We're going to restore the Republic.
[02:37:12.098 --> 02:37:13.640]  We're going to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:14.261]  It's over.
[02:37:14.261 --> 02:37:14.962]  It's on.
[02:37:14.962 --> 02:37:16.103]  Nothing can stop us.
[02:37:16.103 --> 02:37:17.385]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[02:37:17.385 --> 02:37:18.967]  What waters the tree of liberty?
[02:37:19.818 --> 02:37:21.459]  I'm Miracle-Gro to this thing.
[02:37:21.459 --> 02:37:22.559]  I'm bigger than Miracle-Gro.
[02:37:22.559 --> 02:37:24.000]  They don't kill me, but I don't care.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.200]  I'm not going to live as a coward.
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:26.541]  I'm all in, committed.
[02:37:26.541 --> 02:37:27.361]  That's the way it is.
[02:37:27.361 --> 02:37:28.862]  You can't stop it.
[02:37:28.862 --> 02:37:30.823]  I know I'm ranting now.
[02:37:30.823 --> 02:37:41.227]  Dr. Steve Pachinick, of course, wrote the manual on psychological warfare for the State Department, ran CIA operations and other operations all over the world, and he's given us a lot of key information over the years.
[02:37:41.227 --> 02:37:42.988]  It's turned out to be very accurate.
[02:37:42.988 --> 02:37:46.510]  He called right when all this was breaking, before all the analysts had started to go public.
[02:37:47.530 --> 02:37:50.252]  Right as they were, to say the whole Iran thing was fake.
[02:37:50.252 --> 02:37:52.333]  It's basically admitted to be fake now.
[02:37:52.333 --> 02:37:55.395]  And I wanted to see about the green lighting and the rest of it.
[02:37:55.395 --> 02:38:05.280]  But what do you make of the last caller, Doc, just briefly, at the Federal Reserve rally, with somebody saying, you know, throw this canister and activate it with a cell phone.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:08.442]  And the guy said no, and he threatened to physically assault him.
[02:38:08.442 --> 02:38:09.603]  What does that sound like to you?
[02:38:11.274 --> 02:38:17.818]  Well, let me just tell you the personal experience where you have been and you and your show has been very effective.
[02:38:17.818 --> 02:38:29.544]  I just went to the Miami Rally this weekend and they were very peaceful and a lot of people were yelling, uh, listen to Alex Jones, Infowar, turn into it.
[02:38:29.544 --> 02:38:38.368]  And so I just want to congratulate you and the rest of your crew for being very influential in the peaceful demonstrations.
[02:38:38.368 --> 02:38:38.969]  Now, of course,
[02:38:39.589 --> 02:38:43.310]  In every demonstration, you're going to expect some provocateur.
[02:38:43.310 --> 02:38:48.572]  You're going to expect some infiltration.
[02:38:48.572 --> 02:38:56.774]  But most of the time, if this man has a problem, he feels there was a provocative agent, he should go to the Dallas police and find out.
[02:38:56.774 --> 02:39:03.376]  But for the most part, I think you, Alex, really should address yourself to the students all over the country and the world.
[02:39:04.856 --> 02:39:06.037]  Frankly, they're listening to you.
[02:39:06.037 --> 02:39:12.059]  Even in Rome, they were tuning in to you and in for when I was there before the demonstration.
[02:39:12.059 --> 02:39:19.762]  It's not because you agitated them, but because you stood up for principles of freedom and against the principles of corruption that you and I stand for.
[02:39:20.702 --> 02:39:41.895]  And the one thing this administration and many administrations are afraid of, but particularly this one, David Axelrod came out again and in a very stupid, I mean, almost self-denigrating way, I mean, denigrates the president, reaffirms the fact that if you want to find out how strong the president is, just ask Osama Bin Laden.
[02:39:41.895 --> 02:39:44.217]  That's so cynical and so idiotic.
[02:39:44.932 --> 02:40:05.247]  But this is what you would expect from someone who works in the White House, who's paid to be a liar, who's paid to be a spinner, and is telling the American public, you want to vote for somebody who's already proven to be a liar and a sociopath and ineffectual, but you've got to ask a dead man who's already been dead before he was shot.
[02:40:05.247 --> 02:40:06.168]  So my point is,
[02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:17.086]  There's a lot more to do in these demonstrations where you, Alex, are very influential in explaining to these young kids they have to pursue the issue of the corrupt banks.
[02:40:17.086 --> 02:40:19.287]  The banks are absolutely corrupt.
[02:40:19.287 --> 02:40:25.931]  Nothing, not one individual was really indicted for a blank fine, not a blank fine in Goldman Sachs.
[02:40:25.931 --> 02:40:27.332]  It was totally corrupt.
[02:40:27.332 --> 02:40:29.353]  The entire institution was corrupt.
[02:40:29.853 --> 02:40:32.014]  You have to just read the Federal Commission report.
[02:40:32.014 --> 02:40:36.177]  JPMorgan Chase and Citibank.
[02:40:36.177 --> 02:40:45.122]  I mean, you've got a man, Rubin, who was the former Secretary of Treasury under Clinton, receives $120 million for being a counselor and monitoring the bank.
[02:40:45.122 --> 02:40:47.843]  And then he was asked, weren't you aware of the subprime fraud?
[02:40:47.843 --> 02:40:50.165]  He said, no, I wasn't involved in that.
[02:40:50.165 --> 02:40:57.809]  So the level of corruption and the wealth that's egregious, while the poor Americans are working every day, taking two to three jobs,
[02:40:58.448 --> 02:41:02.332]  It's just not acceptable.
[02:41:02.332 --> 02:41:05.295]  And the discrepancy between those who are working.
[02:41:05.295 --> 02:41:07.176]  This is not a class warfare.
[02:41:07.176 --> 02:41:09.438]  This is really what democracy is about.
[02:41:09.438 --> 02:41:14.043]  And I'm proud of you, Alex, and that's why I join your show from time to time to say that
[02:41:14.603 --> 02:41:32.081]  Very rarely do we hear that kind of statement from somebody like yourself and the show, as opposed to what we hear on the mainstream, which identifies these students as deadbeats or hippies or, you know, malcreants or a miscontents, which is not true.
[02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:51.093]  These are people from all walks of life who really have seen and understood the discrepancies between what the government says and does, between a military that goes to war for reasons they don't even understand, and quite frankly, I work with our military, they've lost the war.
[02:41:51.093 --> 02:42:00.801]  Not because they don't know what the war was about, but basically they implemented a war without an end, without a strategy, without any tactics and counter-insurgency.
[02:42:01.583 --> 02:42:11.770]  And counter does not mean anything in a world where you really can't identify the outcome of the endgame or you're dealing in a corrupt society like Karzai in Afghanistan.
[02:42:11.770 --> 02:42:19.656]  By the way, the only thing that did come out with the war in Afghanistan was increased crop of heroin and drugs.
[02:42:19.656 --> 02:42:22.177]  They did very well this year, thank you.
[02:42:22.177 --> 02:42:22.618]  The U.S.
[02:42:22.618 --> 02:42:27.081]  government exceeded their capabilities in instigating a huge crop
[02:42:27.862 --> 02:42:31.144]  of opium that was exceeded the year before.
[02:42:31.144 --> 02:42:41.689]  And in Iraq, we've totally destroyed the country, but we have a $1 billion embassy that's being protected by hundreds of millions of dollars worth of private mercenaries.
[02:42:41.689 --> 02:42:53.034]  So, basically what we have here is we have a government that's non-functional, a legislature that is not only dysfunctional, but really not relevant to the workings of democracy anymore.
[02:42:53.698 --> 02:43:08.409]  When you can appoint 12 people to just take over from a legislature of 560 people, which really doesn't belong, it's arcane, then we really have to rewrite the Constitution, rewrite the way we do government, and we can no longer have just two parties.
[02:43:08.925 --> 02:43:13.427]  We do have to have a third party, and I see your influence is very important.
[02:43:13.427 --> 02:43:20.011]  Whether we agree on all matters or not, that's the process of democracy, and the protest is democracy.
[02:43:20.011 --> 02:43:31.057]  And any legislator who thinks that this is anti-democratic and an anarchistic movement is so wrong, and will be losing his or her job eventually.
[02:43:31.627 --> 02:43:35.472]  That it's pathetic because America is moving.
[02:43:35.472 --> 02:43:46.365]  And in fact, Spark, to you, over these 10 years, people have been listening to what was called the so-called conspiracy unit, you know, you and me and others.
[02:43:46.365 --> 02:43:47.567]  And the truth of the matter is,
[02:43:48.067 --> 02:44:03.212]  The real conspiracy is not committed by you or me, it's just we read out exactly what the government has done, and unfortunately, this government, the government before it, have been liars, deceitful, betrayed, and the American public is not stupid.
[02:44:03.212 --> 02:44:09.014]  I remember under Jimmy Carter, one of the truck drivers once said, you know, what do they think we are, dumb rummies?
[02:44:09.014 --> 02:44:09.334]  We're not.
[02:44:10.003 --> 02:44:11.364]  We're very smart people.
[02:44:11.364 --> 02:44:12.404]  We know what we want.
[02:44:12.404 --> 02:44:18.687]  We want jobs and we want the ability to just state what we want to state without being told what to do.
[02:44:18.687 --> 02:44:24.589]  But we don't want a king or a queen in the form of Obama or Bush Jr.
[02:44:24.589 --> 02:44:26.630]  or their wives or the retinues.
[02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:34.834]  We don't want to pay millions of dollars for Obama to run around and claim that he's doing job opportunities when in fact he's running for the presidency.
[02:44:35.382 --> 02:44:50.925]  And we don't want candidates who are not qualified for the presidency, and I'm really questioning whether we need a presidency, or we just need a committee of governors that can run this United States of America with technicians, the way we have it in Singapore, and get rid of a lot of that bureaucracy.
[02:44:50.925 --> 02:44:52.866]  We don't need all the departments that are there.
[02:44:52.866 --> 02:45:01.467]  We don't need 876,000 top secret candidates in the intelligence community.
[02:45:01.467 --> 02:45:04.188]  Believe me, the intelligence community is not that good.
[02:45:04.815 --> 02:45:17.079]  For the most part, you could get rid of probably 70-80% of them right now because of the effectiveness of social media and some of the outstanding candidates we have in cyber terrorism and cyber security.
[02:45:17.079 --> 02:45:19.260]  But we don't need all these new organizations.
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:21.840]  I don't think anybody knows what's going on.
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:25.822]  Certainly not the Director of National Intelligence estimates.
[02:45:25.822 --> 02:45:28.062]  I mean, that was absurd what happened.
[02:45:28.062 --> 02:45:32.124]  Now we have soldiers going to Chad in Central Africa.
[02:45:32.124 --> 02:45:33.004]  Did you know that, Alex?
[02:45:33.895 --> 02:45:36.736]  Oh yes, well listen, that's my question for you.
[02:45:36.736 --> 02:45:38.576]  And again, we already have a shadow government.
[02:45:38.576 --> 02:45:48.679]  We already have the bureaucracy with the shadow governors and the puppet presidents in there, and an establishment that doesn't care about the future.
[02:45:48.679 --> 02:45:50.179]  They only care about raw power.
[02:45:50.179 --> 02:45:56.121]  But I specifically wanted to ask you, because, I mean, I had so many other guests on last week.
[02:45:56.121 --> 02:46:00.042]  They concurred that the green light was basically going on, but now
[02:46:01.002 --> 02:46:08.247]  It's going back off at least partially because that whole fracas blew up in Obama's face, the whole fake Iranian thing.
[02:46:08.247 --> 02:46:11.209]  But now they're saying, don't worry, they've got more fake plots.
[02:46:11.209 --> 02:46:14.251]  So I want to get into Uganda.
[02:46:14.251 --> 02:46:15.312]  I want to get into Chad.
[02:46:15.312 --> 02:46:20.155]  I want to get into Obama's little African safaris he's got going on.
[02:46:20.155 --> 02:46:26.299]  But first, what's what does this signify that they put out this fake report?
[02:46:26.299 --> 02:46:27.520]  It blew up in their face.
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:30.602]  And does that mean that the Iran attack is off?
[02:46:32.343 --> 02:46:39.005]  Well, it means that, number one, their attempt to try an Iran attack or even on Israel.
[02:46:39.005 --> 02:46:53.390]  What's interesting is when we mentioned, I mentioned to you that Shin Bet created Hamas, my intelligence reports showed me four days ago that Shin Bet went out of their way to talk to Hamas about the release of prisoners.
[02:46:53.390 --> 02:46:54.850]  So you do have an effect.
[02:46:54.850 --> 02:46:56.071]  What it does mean is that
[02:46:56.710 --> 02:47:00.514]  Despite everything we're saying here and despite the American protest.
[02:47:00.514 --> 02:47:03.218]  And by the way, I haven't heard any legislators come forth.
[02:47:03.218 --> 02:47:03.978]  Have you, Alex?
[02:47:03.978 --> 02:47:14.871]  I don't know if anybody in the audience has heard either Democrat or Republican reprobate, uh, uh, denounce what the president did or the administration did because I think they're too cowardly.
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:17.921]  I think what we have are really a bunch of cowards.
[02:47:17.921 --> 02:47:25.843]  So number one, what you've seen is the underlying, underpinning problems of our Constitution and really our society.
[02:47:25.843 --> 02:47:29.264]  Number one, we have legislators who are pretty much crony capitalists.
[02:47:29.264 --> 02:47:32.025]  Two, they're very weak and ineffectual.
[02:47:32.025 --> 02:47:34.046]  Three, they really are ineffective.
[02:47:34.046 --> 02:47:34.786]  We don't need them.
[02:47:35.476 --> 02:47:37.957]  Four, you have a president who's ineffective.
[02:47:37.957 --> 02:47:41.278]  Number five, he doesn't really care what the public says.
[02:47:41.278 --> 02:47:48.261]  Six, you have an intelligence committee and a military that right now that's totally disconnected from the American public.
[02:47:48.261 --> 02:48:04.667]  I think the intelligence organization is growing out of control because there's no one to oversee them and the committees that do oversee them are afraid of the military because they're distributed in such a way as you know in Texas and Alabama and Georgia where they had control of the contracts
[02:48:05.222 --> 02:48:07.243]  For the military-industrial complex.
[02:48:07.243 --> 02:48:13.086]  So in effect, they hold many of the congressmen and senators hostage to the military-industrial complex.
[02:48:13.086 --> 02:48:23.792]  And then you have a lot of cronyism and professionalism in our military, where you have self-aggrandizing generals and colonels leaving the military and then joining the private sector.
[02:48:23.792 --> 02:48:25.533]  So now you have a total disconnect.
[02:48:25.533 --> 02:48:30.435]  We have an imperial America that's tax Americana, but we don't have the Republic.
[02:48:30.435 --> 02:48:32.036]  And the Republic is falling apart.
[02:48:32.614 --> 02:48:47.798]  Which is reminiscent to me and to your audience of the time of Rome, Spain and France where we had large armadas but very ineffectual force projection and really not relevant to where we are right now.
[02:48:48.658 --> 02:48:54.284]  Now we have to concentrate on the fact that the presidency itself is a questionable office.
[02:48:54.284 --> 02:48:55.566]  I've got to be very frank.
[02:48:55.566 --> 02:49:03.975]  I'm tired of having to rationalize the miscreant behaviors of a Clinton or the ineffectual behaviors of the lies of a Bush Jr.
[02:49:05.043 --> 02:49:07.944]  Or the total dysfunctional behavior of an Obama.
[02:49:07.944 --> 02:49:14.405]  And what that tells me is not that I'm right or wrong, it's just that this presidency in particular really doesn't work.
[02:49:14.405 --> 02:49:15.425]  It's anachronistic.
[02:49:15.425 --> 02:49:26.087]  What happens is you have cronyism all around, that you have an incredible amount of money that's spent on protecting someone who really is not relevant to our well-being on an everyday basis.
[02:49:26.087 --> 02:49:27.608]  What's the alternative?
[02:49:27.608 --> 02:49:30.048]  Now that we have social media, we can reconstruct
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:36.225]  The structure of our society according to the needs of what we have and devolution of the federal power.
[02:49:36.225 --> 02:49:41.570]  That's where I do agree with the Ron Pauls and others to say we don't need these institutions.
[02:49:41.570 --> 02:49:43.772]  We don't need a military in Afghanistan.
[02:49:43.772 --> 02:49:45.734]  We don't need military in Iraq.
[02:49:45.734 --> 02:49:50.739]  And now we do not need a military in Africa because there's no reason to be in Uganda.
[02:49:50.739 --> 02:49:56.404]  It's as if the military is restless like a bunch of schoolboys, even our special forces, and they have to run around the world.
[02:49:56.983 --> 02:49:58.523]  Telling you about extreme violence.
[02:49:58.523 --> 02:50:00.064]  Well, that just doesn't happen.
[02:50:00.064 --> 02:50:01.284]  We have to call them back.
[02:50:01.284 --> 02:50:03.944]  We have to reduce the size of our military.
[02:50:03.944 --> 02:50:06.465]  Reduce the size of our intelligence community.
[02:50:06.465 --> 02:50:11.206]  Reduce the size of our, uh... Okay, if we don't, where's America going?
[02:50:11.206 --> 02:50:12.906]  Where's it going in 30 seconds?
[02:50:12.906 --> 02:50:15.927]  As everybody knows, it doesn't protect anybody.
[02:50:15.927 --> 02:50:20.468]  If anything, if I were terrorists, it's so easy to penetrate, I couldn't even tell you.
[02:50:20.468 --> 02:50:22.048]  I don't want to waste the time.
[02:50:22.048 --> 02:50:23.928]  Most people realize it's a joke.
[02:50:23.928 --> 02:50:26.749]  But if there are jobs to be had, they have to be creative.
[02:50:27.372 --> 02:50:35.734]  Through tax incentives, through devolution of federal power, through the fact that the banks have to release credit, and the major banks have to go down.
[02:50:35.734 --> 02:50:39.975]  There's no reason to bail out the banks when we're not bailing out students.
[02:50:39.975 --> 02:50:41.496]  All right, Doc, we've got to go to break.
[02:50:41.496 --> 02:50:42.196]  We'll put him on hold.
[02:50:42.196 --> 02:50:43.476]  We're going to come right back.
[02:50:43.476 --> 02:50:46.637]  Again, Doc is always great, but he's always on that cell phone.
[02:50:46.637 --> 02:50:48.857]  I think a rickety one, too, because he can't hear us.
[02:50:48.857 --> 02:50:50.458]  When we talk to him, he's got to stop.
[02:50:50.458 --> 02:50:54.459]  We'll be right back and get more into this Iran situation and the Israel thing he was talking about.
[02:50:54.459 --> 02:50:54.859]  Stay with us.

[02:54:11.829 --> 02:54:15.953]  Alright, it's my final segment with Dr. Steve Pachinik, a very interesting individual.
[02:54:15.953 --> 02:54:20.057]  I've got to get him on some day just to talk about himself and all the interesting things he's done.
[02:54:20.057 --> 02:54:23.500]  Definitely a spy master, I guess you could call him.
[02:54:23.500 --> 02:54:26.082]  And very interesting points he's been making here today.
[02:54:26.082 --> 02:54:30.926]  I want to go to all these callers that are holding as well, but I promise to read this Corinthians.
[02:54:31.647 --> 02:54:36.049]  13-1-13, and I'll do that in overdrive for five minutes.
[02:54:36.049 --> 02:54:47.135]  But, Doc, in the last five minutes we've got here, centrally getting back to the out-of-control behavior of this Roman Republican decline.
[02:54:47.135 --> 02:54:57.020]  You know, the same old manias, the same old corruptions, the same old looting, some long-term planning, a lot of short-term stuff going on, a lot of backstabbing.
[02:54:58.780 --> 02:55:00.160]  I'm down here by the Texas border.
[02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:08.042]  It's in the front page of the local paper that the kids say pledge of allegiance to the Mexican flag in the public schools in McAllen.
[02:55:08.042 --> 02:55:15.183]  I mean, you cannot make up just how crazy this country's gotten and the fact that it is collapsing.
[02:55:15.183 --> 02:55:17.583]  So how does Iran play into that?
[02:55:17.583 --> 02:55:20.204]  I mean, is the green light on that hit?
[02:55:20.204 --> 02:55:26.005]  I mean, how big of a deal is it that that, I mean, I was trying to ask this earlier, that that whole hoax blew up.
[02:55:27.441 --> 02:55:41.131]  Well, it's a very big deal because they didn't expect this administration to have as many people really come forward from so many different sectors of the media and the analysts and the intelligence community saying, you know, it's enough.
[02:55:41.131 --> 02:55:41.972]  It's stupid.
[02:55:41.972 --> 02:55:45.675]  The Osama bin Laden story didn't work.
[02:55:45.675 --> 02:55:46.976]  This certainly doesn't work.
[02:55:47.897 --> 02:55:55.778]  It clearly diverts attention from Eric Holder, who lied before Congress, who's lying about the Fast and Furious guns in Mexico.
[02:55:55.778 --> 02:56:02.640]  It's diverting attention from Mueller and the miscreant behaviors of the FBI, the ATF, and DEA.
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:11.741]  I don't know how much more the American public is going to have to push, but the protesters are going to have to say, enough is enough, no more wars, no more lies.
[02:56:11.741 --> 02:56:14.662]  And it's just not acceptable.
[02:56:14.662 --> 02:56:16.102]  For less than this, we would have put
[02:56:18.115 --> 02:56:19.556]  I don't care whether he wins or he wins.
[02:56:19.556 --> 02:56:21.678]  I mean, I don't care if he loses.
[02:56:21.678 --> 02:56:28.762]  Clearly, I hope he does, but I don't see an alternative, and I think we're headed on a very self-defeating path, and I think we need a third party.
[02:56:42.904 --> 02:57:01.209]  So, the Tehran issue is a very important one, and Khamenei, who's not the brightest of all leaders, although I worked against his own father and helped to pull out a lot of hostages, is saying very clearly, look, if you persist on this nonsensical story, or even attempt to do anything, that won't be militarily.
[02:57:01.209 --> 02:57:07.171]  They'll try to put pressure in other ways, in terms of getting the Japanese out of the evaluation of the
[02:57:08.251 --> 02:57:09.812]  A nuclear power issue.
[02:57:09.812 --> 02:57:20.060]  And by the way, I'm not pro-Iranian, I am pro-Persian, and I'm pro the students who protest against Khomeini and Aminajad, but these are not stupid people.
[02:57:20.060 --> 02:57:22.662]  And they do need nuclear power.
[02:57:22.662 --> 02:57:23.923]  They do need energy.
[02:57:23.923 --> 02:57:26.085]  It is a huge country.
[02:57:26.085 --> 02:57:32.090]  You can't talk about Iran without talking about Israel having a nuclear bomb, and that discrepancy, and that
[02:57:32.577 --> 02:57:36.818]  That lie that Israel has never admitted to having nuclear weapons, it's absurd.
[02:57:36.818 --> 02:57:45.581]  In the Middle East, that's the quiet wink and the quiet secret that, oh yeah, everybody's allowed not to have a nuclear bomb, but only Israel has one.
[02:57:45.581 --> 02:57:51.723]  And by the way, Pakistan, which is a far more dangerous country because it's not stabilized, has a nuclear bomb.
[02:57:51.723 --> 02:57:56.985]  But you've never heard Netanyahu or anyone, Rabin or Shimon Peres or these great
[02:57:57.535 --> 02:58:13.422]  Intellectual leaders of Israel complain about the Pakistani bomb, which is far more dangerous than any Iranian bomb, because now, Admiral Mueller, in his brilliant incompetency, has not only alienated the Pakistani public, but also alienated the ISI.
[02:58:13.422 --> 02:58:21.546]  So what we have in effect here is, I think you have helped, and I'm not trying to give you accolades, you really have helped through this show.
[02:58:22.126 --> 02:58:32.475]  They instigate a lot of people to think twice, including the mainstream media and the operatives and the intelligence community, as you know well, they listen to us, to say, you know, this is stupid.
[02:58:32.475 --> 02:58:34.157]  This has gone way above the top.
[02:58:34.157 --> 02:58:35.258]  Well, Doc, Doc, it is stupid.
[02:58:35.258 --> 02:58:36.078]  We're out of time.
[02:58:36.078 --> 02:58:36.719]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:36.719 --> 02:58:42.624]  We're all helping together by facing the truth.
[02:58:42.624 --> 02:58:46.047]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.047 --> 02:58:48.249]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:52.483 --> 02:58:56.487]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:58:56.487 --> 02:58:59.750]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:58:59.750 --> 02:59:04.915]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:59:04.915 --> 02:59:10.940]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:59:10.940 --> 02:59:13.183]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.703 --> 02:59:14.023]  Tim Geithner?
[02:59:14.023 --> 02:59:14.464]  Bernanke?
[02:59:14.464 --> 02:59:14.884]  They're arsonists!
[02:59:14.884 --> 02:59:15.644]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:59:15.644 --> 02:59:17.326]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:59:32.617 --> 02:59:34.738]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:59:34.738 --> 02:59:39.882]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:59:39.882 --> 02:59:52.009]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:59:52.009 --> 02:59:55.591]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.591 --> 02:59:58.813]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:08.115 --> 03:00:12.738]  Alright, I ran out of time taking calls and I wanted to get to the rest of your calls.
[03:00:12.738 --> 03:00:19.363]  I also want to talk about the huge development with Fast and Furious, but I'll just be on InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[03:00:19.363 --> 03:00:20.924]  7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern.
[03:00:20.924 --> 03:00:23.766]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the place to find it.
[03:00:23.766 --> 03:00:26.287]  The true front lines in the InfoWars.
[03:00:26.287 --> 03:00:30.690]  And you support our entire operation when you are a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[03:00:30.690 --> 03:00:32.732]  It's got so many functions and movies and
[03:00:33.172 --> 03:00:38.033]  Books and materials and eight and a half years, eight and a half plus years of information.
[03:00:38.033 --> 03:00:42.474]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:00:42.474 --> 03:00:47.455]  Maybe I'll talk more about this Thursday on the show, because Aaron's sitting in tomorrow.
[03:00:47.455 --> 03:01:01.939]  But, I don't know, when you're sitting around calmly thinking about the world and all the beautiful good things that are in it, and all the blessings that God provides us, and then you realize how all of us kind of get decadent and don't appreciate our own lives.
[03:01:03.460 --> 03:01:09.747]  But in the final equation, it's all about love versus hate.
[03:01:09.747 --> 03:01:10.788]  Love versus fear.
[03:01:10.788 --> 03:01:15.174]  A lot of people see my anger and all the things I talk about and they think I'm trying to scare people.
[03:01:15.174 --> 03:01:16.295]  It's the opposite.
[03:01:16.295 --> 03:01:19.479]  I'm trying to get people to move in action against evil.
[03:01:19.479 --> 03:01:20.780]  Because I don't think of you as cowards.
[03:01:21.769 --> 03:01:23.551]  Well, I talk about scary things.
[03:01:23.551 --> 03:01:26.073]  The scary thing is there whether you admit it's there or not.
[03:01:26.073 --> 03:01:28.275]  Why not admit it's there and then deal with it?
[03:01:28.275 --> 03:01:30.236]  I'm trying to deal with it here.
[03:01:30.236 --> 03:01:45.970]  But I was doing some Bible study for homeschooling this morning with my children and we were going over 1 Corinthians 13 and it says, if I speak in the tongues of men or angels but do not have love,
[03:01:47.205 --> 03:01:54.369]  I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
[03:01:54.369 --> 03:02:05.915]  If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all the mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing.
[03:02:10.333 --> 03:02:20.396]  If I give all I possess to the poor, and give my body to hardship, that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
[03:02:20.396 --> 03:02:21.237]  Love is patient.
[03:02:21.237 --> 03:02:22.597]  Love is kind.
[03:02:22.597 --> 03:02:23.497]  It does not envy.
[03:02:23.497 --> 03:02:25.118]  It does not boast.
[03:02:25.118 --> 03:02:26.478]  It is not proud.
[03:02:26.478 --> 03:02:28.619]  It does not dishonor others.
[03:02:28.619 --> 03:02:29.939]  It is not self-seeking.
[03:02:29.939 --> 03:02:31.940]  It is not easily angered.
[03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:33.801]  It keeps no record of wrongs.
[03:02:33.801 --> 03:02:34.501]  That's important.
[03:02:34.501 --> 03:02:36.782]  People keep all this negative stuff in their minds.
[03:02:37.722 --> 03:02:38.963]  Like with their loved ones and people.
[03:02:38.963 --> 03:02:40.084]  You should keep that in your mind.
[03:02:40.084 --> 03:02:41.826]  Remember that evil is evil.
[03:02:41.826 --> 03:02:45.309]  Not just sit there and obsess over petty slights.
[03:02:45.309 --> 03:02:48.251]  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
[03:02:48.251 --> 03:02:49.592]  That's key.
[03:02:49.592 --> 03:02:55.658]  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
[03:02:55.658 --> 03:02:56.559]  Love never fails.
[03:02:57.682 --> 03:03:00.946]  But where there are prophecies, they will cease.
[03:03:00.946 --> 03:03:03.748]  Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.
[03:03:03.748 --> 03:03:06.271]  Where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
[03:03:06.271 --> 03:03:12.297]  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
[03:03:12.297 --> 03:03:17.963]  But when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.
[03:03:19.076 --> 03:03:21.058]  When I was a child, this is the key here.
[03:03:21.058 --> 03:03:23.521]  When I was a child, I talked like a child.
[03:03:23.521 --> 03:03:24.923]  I thought like a child.
[03:03:24.923 --> 03:03:26.505]  I reasoned like a child.
[03:03:26.505 --> 03:03:28.147]  But when I became a man, I put...
[03:03:29.255 --> 03:03:31.797]  The waves of childhood behind me.
[03:03:31.797 --> 03:03:33.799]  See, so many people have not put that behind them.
[03:03:33.799 --> 03:03:36.381]  They're children.
[03:03:36.381 --> 03:03:38.042]  Childlike minds.
[03:03:38.042 --> 03:03:38.623]  Continuing.
[03:03:38.623 --> 03:03:41.625]  For now we see only a reflection in a mirror.
[03:03:41.625 --> 03:03:44.467]  Then we shall see face to face.
[03:03:44.467 --> 03:03:46.389]  Now I know in part.
[03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:48.331]  Then I shall know fully.
[03:03:48.331 --> 03:03:50.352]  Even as I am fully known.
[03:03:50.352 --> 03:03:53.254]  And now, these three remain.
[03:03:53.254 --> 03:03:54.596]  Faith, hope, and love.
[03:03:54.596 --> 03:03:56.037]  But the greatest of these is love.
[03:03:57.344 --> 03:04:01.265]  And that's from Corinthians.
[03:04:01.265 --> 03:04:04.745]  Love, moment in forever.
[03:04:04.745 --> 03:04:08.806]  Love for your family, love of the truth, being honorable, that lives forever.
[03:04:08.806 --> 03:04:12.627]  That echoes out through eternity, through the universe.
[03:04:12.627 --> 03:04:17.247]  The universe bends towards love, it bends towards justice, and that's why I'm not afraid.
[03:04:17.247 --> 03:04:25.469]  I'm not afraid of what we've got to go through, I'm not afraid of what I face, because it is a great honor to be alive today.
[03:04:25.469 --> 03:04:26.289]  It is a great honor.
[03:04:27.543 --> 03:04:37.352]  to watch hawks fighting repeatedly while I've been here to have a dolphin swim along the boat and actually turn its head and look at me.
[03:04:37.352 --> 03:04:38.833]  And that's magic.
[03:04:38.833 --> 03:04:40.915]  Life is magic and creation is a gift.
[03:04:40.915 --> 03:04:42.256]  I'm Alex Jones signing off.
[03:04:42.256 --> 03:04:42.737]  See you tomorrow.
[03:04:55.600 --> 03:04:58.524]  See you back tonight, 7 o'clock, in Fall Wars Nightly News.
[03:04:58.524 --> 03:04:58.824]  Be there.
