[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:37.320]  Texas Alex Jones it is Tuesday October 18th 2011 we're gonna be live here for
[00:37.320 --> 00:42.600]  the next three hours Dr. Chief Pachennick Steve Pachennick will be
[00:42.600 --> 00:47.320]  joining us coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show today to give us
[00:47.320 --> 00:51.160]  more breakdown and analysis on the attempts to take this country to war
[00:51.160 --> 00:58.320]  with Iran and to be able to finish up his comments that brought us to the end
[00:58.320 --> 01:06.680]  of the show back on Friday with him dealing with Israel and several other
[01:06.680 --> 01:15.800]  subjects so that is coming up today also as info wars.com reported as
[01:15.800 --> 01:21.600]  Reuters even reported yesterday a major scientific study has proven that Ron
[01:21.600 --> 01:27.560]  Paul is getting the least amount of media coverage and debate time of any of the
[01:27.560 --> 01:31.800]  candidates and he's in number three undisputed and if he was getting fair
[01:31.800 --> 01:37.720]  coverage he would be number one no need to belabor that point it's on the Drudge
[01:37.720 --> 01:42.760]  report it's it's all over national news yesterday and today but all of us just
[01:42.760 --> 01:50.680]  watching could see this and I know that my researchers and info wars.com just
[01:50.680 --> 01:54.800]  the last few months have taped the debates and have we've written articles
[01:54.800 --> 02:00.000]  showing that Ron Paul gets the least amount of time so we don't need a
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.240]  scientific study to show us what's happening and that when he gets
[02:04.240 --> 02:10.320]  questions they tend to be very very negative now when the mainstream dying
[02:10.320 --> 02:15.800]  pretty much illegitimate mainstream media in fact illegitimate is not even a
[02:15.800 --> 02:22.120]  word they are illegitimate by and large when the not even pertinent not even in
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.320]  the game mainstream media does these types of things they lose more and more
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.600]  credibility and that's one of the points that needs to be raised today
[02:31.600 --> 02:35.920]  certainly a lot of mainstream news is just straight-up facts like a red tide
[02:35.920 --> 02:43.000]  hit the entire Texas coastline the last two days or an airplane crashed at such
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.040]  time it's when you get into political issues that you see the spin the
[02:48.040 --> 02:52.480]  deception the lying by omission and that's starting to kill the mainstream
[02:52.480 --> 02:58.040]  media I did notice though I would pleasantly surprised to see the cover
[02:58.040 --> 03:07.600]  of the New York Times today talking about the Occupy Wall Street people and it
[03:07.600 --> 03:15.600]  is extremely extremely pretty much fair and balanced to use a Fox News term and
[03:15.600 --> 03:22.640]  it admits that Occupy Wall Street on the ground is a very very diverse group and
[03:22.640 --> 03:26.840]  that the Democratic Party has basically been trying to take it over and co-opted
[03:26.840 --> 03:31.640]  but that that is failing we have a zero-hedge article up at infoworks.com
[03:31.640 --> 03:36.320]  pointing this out again today we're not saying the Occupy Wall Street people are
[03:36.320 --> 03:41.200]  bad we're saying that the leadership the people who've claimed that they're the
[03:41.200 --> 03:47.160]  leaders of it are calling for austerity measures upon the middle class to
[03:47.160 --> 03:51.880]  supposedly transfer the wealth to the poor and I guess that means people that
[03:51.880 --> 03:56.000]  went and got to college degrees and can't find a job because of globalization
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.960]  you know the signs I've seen countless signs in Austin and New York and around
[04:01.960 --> 04:07.440]  the country saying things redistribute or else redistribute or revolution
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.480]  redistribute or violence there's a new poll out today that shows that one third
[04:12.480 --> 04:15.680]  of the Occupy Wall Street people are saying they wanted violence or
[04:15.680 --> 04:22.400]  advocated we're seeing you know different top people at the speaking events
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.920]  calling for violence and there's no mistake this is happening in October
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.160]  there's no mistake that George Soros and others are trying to hijack it but the
[04:31.160 --> 04:36.200]  New York Times has a photo here it says young educated and unemployed another
[04:36.200 --> 04:40.880]  photo here of six on the front say reform corporate welfare that's a big
[04:40.880 --> 04:46.120]  legitimate issue here's another one end the Fed and it's a fellow with an
[04:46.120 --> 04:49.100]  American flag beside him this is not meant to make them look bad end of the
[04:49.100 --> 04:53.540]  Fed stop the wars and then you got an info wars listener with an info wars
[04:53.540 --> 05:00.680]  com sticker here another one saying I'm very upset stay with us this is Alex
[05:00.680 --> 05:03.800]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered
[05:03.800 --> 05:07.680]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:07.680 --> 05:11.960]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:11.960 --> 05:16.240]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.240 --> 05:20.560]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.560 --> 05:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.640 --> 05:29.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.200 --> 05:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.320 --> 05:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.280 --> 05:41.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.120 --> 05:43.840]  really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from

[08:30.880 --> 08:35.160]  uh... in the budget cuts across the board in welfare corporate welfare
[08:35.160 --> 08:40.920]  military expense uh... defense spending all of it that's big news
[08:40.920 --> 08:45.200]  that we've got the neocons and uh... the desperate obama noids
[08:45.200 --> 08:49.200]  trying to become politically popular again trying to launch a distraction
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.320]  war against iran right now that is still got a green light but more and more
[08:54.320 --> 08:59.520]  people are coming out pointing out that the uh... iranian assassination plot
[08:59.520 --> 09:02.240]  was completely phoning
[09:02.240 --> 09:04.400]  uh... that is all unfolding
[09:04.400 --> 09:08.720]  uh... right now obviously the federal reserve of san antonio
[09:08.720 --> 09:13.200]  requested formally and last night on the nightly news we showed uh... that that
[09:13.200 --> 09:14.240]  youtube
[09:14.240 --> 09:15.440]  uh...
[09:15.440 --> 09:17.640]  communicate uh... notice
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.040]  uh... that the federal reserve had requested that the
[09:21.040 --> 09:24.600]  video where they admit that the federal reserve is private
[09:24.600 --> 09:26.000]  be removed
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.040]  uh... i'd left the video up and challenged it and it's before youtube
[09:30.040 --> 09:31.760]  review board right now and
[09:31.760 --> 09:34.520]  could be taken down or couldn't be no one really knows
[09:34.520 --> 09:38.200]  how these things work but it just shows the uh... federal reserve always
[09:38.200 --> 09:39.720]  engaged
[09:39.720 --> 09:40.680]  in attempts
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.840]  to silence free speech uh... in this country but
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.800]  uh... the jigs up uh... the the genius out of the bottle the trainers left the
[09:47.800 --> 09:48.480]  station
[09:48.480 --> 09:51.880]  once the private federal reserve is identified
[09:51.880 --> 09:53.240]  as private
[09:53.240 --> 09:54.240]  it's over
[09:54.240 --> 09:57.560]  once people understand that they got rid of u s senators
[09:57.560 --> 10:02.080]  uh... being elected at the state level by the legislature
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.640]  uh... that the same time they brought in the income tax that we've got the
[10:05.640 --> 10:06.680]  federal reserve
[10:06.680 --> 10:09.200]  and that all of this is about power grabbing
[10:09.200 --> 10:11.680]  ending states rights ending our republic
[10:11.680 --> 10:15.600]  and transferring power to a private global corporate government that is now
[10:15.600 --> 10:17.560]  when it's final moves
[10:17.560 --> 10:20.360]  to bankrupt the entire world
[10:20.360 --> 10:22.720]  there's it's also in the press today
[10:22.720 --> 10:27.720]  uh... that the european union were by next monday
[10:27.720 --> 10:32.080]  uh... will announce its new massive restructuring but they've already told
[10:32.080 --> 10:32.880]  the world
[10:32.880 --> 10:34.080]  it is a private
[10:34.080 --> 10:36.320]  bank of the world based in europe
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.520]  that the one sovereign nations that signed on the e you
[10:40.520 --> 10:43.520]  uh... will pay their taxes to all these new
[10:43.520 --> 10:44.760]  uh... taxes
[10:44.760 --> 10:48.400]  and that the country's will never be allowed to exit again
[10:48.400 --> 10:51.680]  and that no vote by the people can extricate them
[10:51.680 --> 10:54.880]  it is classical tyranny classical
[10:54.880 --> 10:57.120]  occupation but under the rubric
[10:57.120 --> 11:01.320]  of financial occupation it is unbelievable tyranny
[11:01.320 --> 11:04.840]  but because it doesn't come in the form of soldiers on the street corners with
[11:04.840 --> 11:06.200]  some machine guns
[11:06.200 --> 11:09.880]  and political dissidents being drug off in tanks rolling across
[11:09.880 --> 11:12.520]  your borders and your capital being taken over in a
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.320]  foreign flag being run up because it's not a conquering army like hitler
[11:17.320 --> 11:19.040]  or stalin
[11:19.040 --> 11:23.000]  rolling into eastern europe or napoleon before them uh... or william the
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.920]  conqueror going into england
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.760]  because it's not a classical invasion and takeover people don't understand how
[11:29.760 --> 11:31.440]  to respond to it
[11:31.440 --> 11:32.880]  i like it into
[11:32.880 --> 11:34.520]  doto birds
[11:34.520 --> 11:39.520]  when western sailors arrived on the island uh... where the doto birds were
[11:39.520 --> 11:42.520]  and the doto birds were completely domesticated
[11:42.520 --> 11:44.680]  and did not fear humans
[11:44.680 --> 11:48.120]  and so the sailors could just go conch on the head
[11:48.120 --> 11:50.880]  and go to good fresh meal out of them
[11:50.880 --> 11:53.880]  uh... course uh...
[11:53.880 --> 11:56.280]  people that study nature
[11:56.280 --> 12:00.400]  uh... naturalist and others have pointed out there's a lot of documentaries
[12:00.400 --> 12:01.040]  about
[12:01.040 --> 12:03.320]  small uninhabited islands
[12:03.320 --> 12:06.680]  uh... that have goats on them that have been put there hundreds of years before
[12:06.680 --> 12:07.640]  by sailors
[12:07.640 --> 12:12.840]  or natural deer or wild pigs or pickerings other
[12:12.840 --> 12:14.720]  uh... other uh... species
[12:14.720 --> 12:18.280]  uh... that they're not afraid of humans they'll walk right up to you
[12:18.280 --> 12:21.240]  you can conch them on the head and eat them
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.840]  and generally it takes a while for them you'll walk right over and conch them on
[12:25.840 --> 12:27.080]  the head or shoot them or
[12:27.080 --> 12:31.400]  spear them and others will watch as you eat them
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.440]  and uh... generally one or two get smart and run off and then they'll produce
[12:35.440 --> 12:36.360]  the new
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.440]  stock that it's like once animals aren't afraid of you once
[12:41.440 --> 12:43.840]  once they're either domesticated or
[12:43.840 --> 12:46.280]  or or never been in contact with humans
[12:46.280 --> 12:49.520]  there they're just totally unaware
[12:49.520 --> 12:50.760]  and that's what's happening
[12:50.760 --> 12:54.360]  globalism is a modern spin
[12:54.360 --> 13:00.360]  on every form of conquering tyranny this planet's ever seen
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.200]  and it's a political domination it's a corporate domination now we've seen by
[13:05.200 --> 13:07.120]  stealth moves
[13:07.120 --> 13:09.440]  uh... of cultural domination
[13:09.440 --> 13:14.080]  uh... by groups by religions by ideas that can also happen
[13:14.080 --> 13:16.600]  by semi-stealth
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.320]  uh... that's not new but this this corporate
[13:20.320 --> 13:22.560]  uh... creeping
[13:22.560 --> 13:24.840]  uh... macchiavellian system
[13:24.840 --> 13:27.040]  uh... is certainly new
[13:27.040 --> 13:30.960]  uh... in the last hundred years and that's why people aren't aware of it but
[13:30.960 --> 13:35.840]  your taxes the regulations how your police dress what the laws are
[13:35.840 --> 13:40.520]  uh... what land you can own what businesses you can operate
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.680]  uh... what type of uh... things you can sell uh... carbon taxes
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.600]  all
[13:46.600 --> 13:47.720]  run
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.480]  by this new quote financial private union
[13:51.480 --> 13:54.280]  that they're likening to the marshal plan
[13:54.280 --> 13:57.040]  well that was just the west going into europe
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.880]  england the u.s. the england american empire and simply taking europe into
[14:00.880 --> 14:02.600]  receivership
[14:02.600 --> 14:05.880]  uh... but they still couldn't get rid of the sovereignty itself so
[14:05.880 --> 14:09.640]  they set up the trade agreements that brought them into the euro
[14:09.640 --> 14:13.120]  and already over eighty percent of their laws or montains correct me it's over
[14:13.120 --> 14:14.160]  seventy
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.800]  and i'm always saying seventy percent it's well over eighty percent now
[14:17.800 --> 14:20.560]  or what did he say five out of six
[14:20.560 --> 14:22.480]  uh... laws
[14:22.480 --> 14:24.480]  on record
[14:24.480 --> 14:27.920]  are just created by private bureaucrats who were all
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.720]  finance capital bankers
[14:32.720 --> 14:34.600]  the opposite
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.680]  of free market
[14:37.680 --> 14:38.520]  so
[14:38.520 --> 14:40.080]  that's what we're facing
[14:40.080 --> 14:42.960]  uh... here right now now here's an example of
[14:42.960 --> 14:44.840]  stealth cultural
[14:44.840 --> 14:48.000]  takeover and i'm gonna cover a few other news items and give the
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.720]  number out for listeners to call in about
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.000]  i spent probably two hours of the three-hour radio show yesterday talking
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.400]  about being down here on the texas mexico border
[14:59.400 --> 15:02.600]  where the people are now scared of the drug cartels they're scared of the
[15:02.600 --> 15:04.080]  police
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.640]  uh... i've never seen such a groveling uh... i was about three miles away from
[15:08.640 --> 15:10.840]  the mexican border two days ago
[15:10.840 --> 15:13.800]  uh... on a little charter boat i got for my family
[15:13.800 --> 15:15.560]  to go to some fishing
[15:15.560 --> 15:18.880]  and uh... i ended up saying give me a tour
[15:18.880 --> 15:22.560]  you know basically around padre island south padre island
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.760]  uh... and every time they saw a homeland security boat an ice boat
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.640]  uh... a coast guard boat i mean there was a literal stepping and fetching and
[15:30.640 --> 15:31.720]  groveling and
[15:31.720 --> 15:35.640]  bowing down and cutting engines when they even drove by
[15:35.640 --> 15:37.400]  at uh...
[15:37.400 --> 15:40.280]  three hundred four yards away and i would say i've never seen this before i've
[15:40.280 --> 15:40.860]  been
[15:40.860 --> 15:43.080]  deep sea fishing and bay fishing all over
[15:43.080 --> 15:45.360]  all over texas and other parts of the country
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.600]  and they said yeah if you don't cut your engines when they come around anywhere
[15:49.600 --> 15:52.520]  then they board you and get your face now
[15:52.520 --> 15:55.680]  and and and literally these men would just drive by in these black uniforms
[15:55.680 --> 15:57.560]  just bugging their eyes out
[15:57.560 --> 16:02.240]  at uh... a lot you know a little charter boat with uh... two guys on it
[16:02.240 --> 16:06.960]  i mean it is it is letting you know you're a slave
[16:06.960 --> 16:09.920]  now while all of this is going on
[16:09.920 --> 16:15.480]  mexico in three years has forty plus thousand dead five thousand dead on this side so forty
[16:15.480 --> 16:16.640]  five thousand
[16:16.640 --> 16:20.140]  there have been gunfights gun battles newspapers tv stations have been
[16:20.140 --> 16:21.640]  threatened here
[16:21.640 --> 16:25.240]  uh... in the brownsville uh... mcowen kingsville
[16:25.240 --> 16:29.600]  south padre area they admit they won't report on it now
[16:29.600 --> 16:33.960]  and a lot of people instead of getting angry at the mexican cartels and mad at
[16:33.960 --> 16:35.220]  the mexican government
[16:35.220 --> 16:38.600]  and it's expansionist aims which is really funny
[16:38.600 --> 16:41.000]  you've got a collapsing failed state
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.400]  that for forty years has taught in the schools that our own state department
[16:45.400 --> 16:47.520]  finance and for foundation as well
[16:47.520 --> 16:49.200]  we've shown these on air
[16:49.200 --> 16:51.360]  that the southwest belongs to mexico
[16:51.360 --> 16:54.360]  and that it's going to be a racial kingdom for hispanics
[16:54.360 --> 16:57.560]  when hispanics whites blacks are all completely integrating and
[16:57.560 --> 17:00.360]  getting along in business in general life and
[17:00.360 --> 17:04.240]  uh... in the intermarrying i mean it but but it doesn't matter
[17:04.240 --> 17:06.520]  you've got america that's been taught
[17:06.520 --> 17:10.880]  to uh... be uh... anti-national sovereignty
[17:10.880 --> 17:13.920]  lowering our immune system to foreign powers
[17:13.920 --> 17:14.880]  okay
[17:14.880 --> 17:16.080]  and the cultural
[17:16.080 --> 17:19.240]  uh... assimilation and domination they're not assimilating into the
[17:19.240 --> 17:20.080]  republic
[17:20.080 --> 17:23.240]  or the free market or the second amendment culture no
[17:23.240 --> 17:28.520]  mexico and this is taught in public this was taught at anderson high school
[17:28.520 --> 17:30.360]  i went to high school a couple years
[17:30.360 --> 17:32.040]  in dallas a couple in austin
[17:32.040 --> 17:34.560]  this was taught and i'm gonna give you the news here in a minute
[17:34.560 --> 17:36.920]  this was taught
[17:36.920 --> 17:39.200]  uh... here
[17:39.200 --> 17:40.760]  in austin texas
[17:40.760 --> 17:43.400]  twenty years ago when i was in high school
[17:43.400 --> 17:46.640]  and it was taught by my white history teacher
[17:46.640 --> 17:50.320]  and by my white art teacher that america was bad it belonged to mexico
[17:50.320 --> 17:53.120]  and that's in the southwest would be as long
[17:53.120 --> 17:56.360]  uh... it's all forage foundation programming and we were taken to u t
[17:56.360 --> 17:57.800]  the art class and
[17:57.800 --> 18:00.600]  taught all this stuff and i stood up and said i'm not putting up with this
[18:00.600 --> 18:03.360]  you know mexico does all these horrible things to immigrants and
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.280]  you know uh... and and and and as a club talk or a c
[18:07.280 --> 18:10.080]  i got up this morning and saw the monitor
[18:10.080 --> 18:11.600]  the mckellon monitor
[18:11.600 --> 18:15.320]  and it's a spanish class riles parents and of course it was glenn beck that
[18:15.320 --> 18:17.400]  broke this you're not going to see this
[18:17.400 --> 18:19.640]  broken in a local newspaper
[18:19.640 --> 18:22.680]  and it goes on to say glenn beck the father played the video the school's
[18:22.680 --> 18:23.920]  defending it
[18:23.920 --> 18:28.320]  we're gonna get this up and fall wars dot com the monitor dot com has the video
[18:28.320 --> 18:31.200]  and i'm gonna get her name of it let's ask her to post this right now
[18:31.200 --> 18:34.160]  spanish class riles parents and you read it
[18:34.160 --> 18:36.600]  they are taught mexican history
[18:36.600 --> 18:39.760]  in the spanish class they're taught america stole all land
[18:39.760 --> 18:41.080]  that's the real issue
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.760]  it's mexican government ford foundation why would the big elite banks private
[18:44.760 --> 18:46.120]  foundation want this
[18:46.120 --> 18:47.960]  to break up america
[18:47.960 --> 18:51.000]  you know they're gonna wreck mexico would divide in congress and wreck us with
[18:51.000 --> 18:52.840]  it as well
[18:52.840 --> 18:54.680]  and it goes on to say
[18:54.680 --> 18:58.240]  that they are they they give the spanish national anthem and pledge
[18:58.240 --> 19:00.480]  allegiance to mexico
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.000]  but it goes further ladies and gentlemen this is taught everywhere
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.680]  this is taught in illinois this is taught in new york
[19:06.680 --> 19:09.840]  if your class is twenty percent spanish speaking it's taught
[19:09.840 --> 19:12.560]  and i've seen a lot of port uricans and others that have shot video that are
[19:12.560 --> 19:14.120]  offended by it they're like

[19:21.640 --> 19:26.800]  mexico it's just it's it's because mexico is one of the most nationalistic
[19:26.800 --> 19:29.520]  countries in the world which i'm not saying that's a bad thing at the end of
[19:29.520 --> 19:31.800]  the day america used to be like that
[19:31.800 --> 19:35.680]  america is very macho uh... but but so is mexico
[19:35.680 --> 19:38.400]  and now america's been taught we've seen it all over the country we can't wear

[24:19.760 --> 24:25.400]  about I've written the articles I have covered it I've had the inside guess time
[24:25.400 --> 24:33.080]  and Fox News today had Darrell Issa on and the article is at Fox News we're
[24:33.080 --> 24:39.560]  gonna get linked up at info wars.com but I also want to also want to get Watson
[24:39.560 --> 24:42.240]  to write a more detailed article pointing our older articles that pointed
[24:42.240 --> 24:48.240]  all this out that bush was involved in operation gun runner it just was not
[24:48.240 --> 24:53.920]  called fast and furious and bush was not the bush administration was then not
[24:53.920 --> 25:00.000]  using it to go after the Second Amendment they were just shipping guns
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.520]  this is now confirmed we're gonna put it on screen for you if you're watching a
[25:03.520 --> 25:11.680]  prisonplanet.tv this is now confirmed but we already knew it just like I
[25:11.680 --> 25:15.080]  already told you years ago that when I went to public school and I've
[25:15.080 --> 25:19.600]  confirmed it across the country they teach that the southwest is Mexico and
[25:19.600 --> 25:23.640]  white people are evil that's only done so the globalists can break up the
[25:23.640 --> 25:29.680]  United States and play his spanish stuff against whites they do not they do not
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.320]  want us recognizing a real enemy the globalists I mean it's very elementary
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.880]  just like the globalist are balkanizing Mexico by financing all the major
[25:37.880 --> 25:42.080]  cartels to kill each other it's come out that the ATF has shipped guns to
[25:42.080 --> 25:49.360]  Sinaloa Los Zetas the cartel as it's called and other subgroups they shipped
[25:49.360 --> 25:54.000]  them the guns directly they only had a few gun walking programs on video with
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.840]  their own agents as well to demonize the Second Amendment that as I said
[25:57.840 --> 26:03.600]  yesterday is the raw meat to the lions as a colonel Schaefer would put it or I
[26:03.600 --> 26:09.480]  liken to yesterday on the nightly news that I did via Skype last night with
[26:09.480 --> 26:13.280]  Aaron Dykes to a mockingbird if you don't live around the state bird of
[26:13.280 --> 26:16.920]  Texas most states have mockingbirds they'll they'll build nested low bushes
[26:16.920 --> 26:20.520]  or small trees and if you get anywhere near it when you're mowing the yard or
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.200]  water and plants or fixing something they'll flop around the ground act like
[26:24.200 --> 26:29.640]  their wing is broken they ought to win Academy Awards and they don't want you
[26:29.640 --> 26:32.920]  getting near their babies that have hatched or near their eggs and then
[26:32.920 --> 26:36.520]  they'll start dive bombing you as well a lot of other bird species will do it but
[26:36.520 --> 26:41.120]  that's all that it was coming out in federal court six seven months ago that
[26:41.120 --> 26:47.240]  the CIA was allowing with eight other federal agencies ATF DEA border patrol
[26:47.240 --> 26:52.760]  customs ICE Homeland Security over but they were allowing drugs to be shipped
[26:52.760 --> 26:56.360]  in and they were shipping guns out that's always been going on this is just
[26:56.360 --> 27:02.480]  Iran Contra again Iran Contra wasn't new fast and furious isn't new it's just a
[27:02.480 --> 27:07.960]  new name because Obama was going to also then try to blame it on the second
[27:07.960 --> 27:14.200]  amendment when it was a globalist destabilization program in Mexico and so
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.360]  there's Darrell is on Fox News going Bush was involved he noticed I'm the
[27:18.360 --> 27:23.000]  only one that's been saying for months Darrell is that can't go after Obama
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.360]  that's why he came out and said look holder attorney general I know you
[27:28.360 --> 27:32.480]  perjured yourself say it was a mistake or we're going to have to move to indict
[27:32.480 --> 27:35.880]  your butt this is what you got to come in you got to come in and say it was a
[27:35.880 --> 27:39.800]  mistake people said why is he giving him that out because it will bring down
[27:39.800 --> 27:45.640]  the entire system who do you think runs America six megabanks that openly
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.080]  launder and run the drug money they run the aircraft they've been caught from
[27:50.080 --> 27:58.240]  pillar to post from beginning to end in the entire chain in the entire control
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.720]  system and we're trying to dig up the video Rob saw it this morning and found
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.280]  the Fox News article but we're trying to dig up the video on YouTube so we can
[28:05.280 --> 28:08.440]  have it tonight on the nightly news or maybe even on the show later today with
[28:08.440 --> 28:12.960]  this Fox News saying this goes back to Bush and now you're going to see a lot
[28:12.960 --> 28:17.480]  of Republicans go well you can't blame Bush here's my guns just like they like
[28:17.480 --> 28:21.520]  Mitt Romney who's for gun control abortion carbon taxes supports John P.
[28:21.520 --> 28:29.760]  Holdren wrote the Obamacare healthcare the Republicans don't care about saving
[28:29.760 --> 28:34.000]  America that is mainline country club Republicans they care about feeling
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.240]  like they're part of the power structure while they get gang raped by the new
[28:37.240 --> 28:41.880]  world order there they live in a delusional land like lobotomized
[28:41.880 --> 28:46.840]  monkeys same thing with Democrats they don't care of Obama's torturing
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.000]  launching wars is a warlord attacking Africa as we predicted three years ago
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.480]  in Obama deception as long as they get to feel like their winners and put his
[28:55.480 --> 29:01.200]  bumper sticker on it's like a Cowboys fan I was talking to a guy yesterday who's
[29:01.200 --> 29:04.760]  a big football fan he was telling all the famous football players he knows and
[29:04.760 --> 29:08.000]  how he's got all these signed helmets and how it's his whole life to him and I
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.720]  couldn't even bring it to him saying you're like a child sir who's been given
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.320]  all these fake wars and fake tribes to love there's a reason you love it so
[29:16.320 --> 29:20.040]  much because it's what you would have been as a man warring for liberty and
[29:20.040 --> 29:24.440]  freedom in the info war and physically of need be as the founders said even if
[29:24.440 --> 29:29.360]  you're aware of everything and fight for liberty you probably can't keep it but
[29:29.360 --> 29:35.640]  we're a nation of naive men and women now I just distracted off of myself in

[33:18.240 --> 33:29.400]  dragon on yeah I'm down here on the Texas Mexico border just a stone's throw
[33:29.400 --> 33:34.760]  from the border I can I can see Mexico out my window here and I've been
[33:34.760 --> 33:40.680]  investigating the takeover of the United States by the drug cartels backed by
[33:40.680 --> 33:47.760]  the CIA they are now recruiting our school children and then the rival drug
[33:47.760 --> 33:53.400]  dealers will be put in the private prisons it is so diabolical it's how
[33:53.400 --> 34:00.080]  the British took down China the Chinese made drugs illegal made opium illegal
[34:00.080 --> 34:03.760]  and the British went in and in just a few generations were able to buy off all
[34:03.760 --> 34:08.840]  of the local tabulary corrupt them make giant profits because it was illegal
[34:08.840 --> 34:14.000]  China that didn't know thieves breaking into houses for goods suddenly had the
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.200]  equivalent of thieves today breaking into your house for your computer your
[34:17.200 --> 34:21.740]  stereo your jewelry to buy the overpriced product it is a tax the
[34:21.740 --> 34:26.380]  entire drug war is a tax to the megabanks to the globalist it's their
[34:26.380 --> 34:30.840]  unofficial tax now they're moving on to carbon taxes for all human activity
[34:30.840 --> 34:35.480]  they're moving on to VAT and sales taxes to pay off what we owe as Herman Cain
[34:35.480 --> 34:39.000]  Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck and the rest of them say when we don't even owe
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.360]  this money and it's impossible to pay back the derivatives but the public's
[34:43.360 --> 34:48.680]  going to find out now now now here's some good news I want to get into after
[34:48.680 --> 34:53.880]  getting to the bad news the New York Times covered today is actually honest
[34:53.880 --> 34:58.200]  and admits that Occupy Wall Street's extremely diverse you've got George
[34:58.200 --> 35:02.000]  Soros and the Democrats speaking as if they lead it but even the establishment
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.840]  New York Times they just got a new editor there a month ago suddenly they're
[35:05.840 --> 35:10.520]  coming out saying it's a hoax that Iran was behind this attack or this planned
[35:10.520 --> 35:14.720]  attack last week and they've got a article here basically saying it's very
[35:14.720 --> 35:19.760]  diverse and across the board and they've got in the Fed on the front and
[35:19.760 --> 35:24.320]  talk about the Federal Reserve people being mad at it they've got a Alex Jones
[35:24.320 --> 35:29.200]  listener wearing the Obama Joker shirt that we sold and on the back of his
[35:29.200 --> 35:37.120]  guitar as a sign he says 9-1-1 was an inside job info wars.com prison
[35:37.120 --> 35:41.960]  planet.com and then he's got another one of my stickers don't tread on me live
[35:41.960 --> 35:47.440]  free or die I don't know if you can see this over the Skype with me here on the
[35:47.440 --> 35:53.720]  road but there it is right there you've got the in the Fed and you've got a
[35:53.720 --> 36:02.960]  corporate welfare one here that says reform corporate welfare and says
[36:02.960 --> 36:08.440]  countless grievances one thread we're angry and it says they're tired of the
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.560]  bailouts they're tired of the banksters could it be the New York Times actually
[36:13.560 --> 36:20.600]  wants to survive could it be the actual hotel a little bit of the truth they
[36:20.600 --> 36:23.480]  got this new editor and I'm telling you it's like a ship turning away from an
[36:23.480 --> 36:26.680]  iceberg I'm not saying the New York Times is great I saw a lot of baloney in
[36:26.680 --> 36:31.680]  here this morning but it's definitely a major turn I wouldn't say a 180 Richard
[36:31.680 --> 36:37.200]  what is it when you don't make a 180 but you make about a half turn 90 degree
[36:37.200 --> 36:43.720]  turn yeah it's kind of a 90 degree turn that they've taken so that's interesting
[36:43.720 --> 36:46.040]  right there I said I'd get to it in a minute there I just covered it there
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.120]  maybe I'll read some of that later but when I get on the road I tend to
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.600]  actually just buy newspapers because all day I'm reading info wars.com and we
[36:55.600 --> 36:59.080]  actually brought a printer but my wife has expropriated it for the home school
[36:59.080 --> 37:04.680]  teaching Richard we need to buy a little printer so because it's impossible for me
[37:04.680 --> 37:08.440]  to surf over here just remind me next week or this week we have the crew by
[37:08.440 --> 37:12.760]  it some little you know highly rated compact printer so I could just print
[37:12.760 --> 37:15.960]  all these articles because you know now I'm trying to find the whole issa
[37:15.960 --> 37:21.240]  headline where where I'm paraphrasing and I had it on screen earlier it was you
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.480]  know issa acknowledges previous gun stings under bush similar to fast and
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.880]  furious in fact we could just have jaren come on air I don't think we have our
[37:31.880 --> 37:34.400]  producers hooked up with their mics where they can go on air even though I've
[37:34.400 --> 37:38.840]  requested that and they can actually read you the headline but point is it's
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.920]  out there we were getting it up on info wars.com and I told you this was going
[37:43.920 --> 37:50.120]  on under bush why is Paul Watson in February listeners we read our email
[37:50.120 --> 37:58.360]  it's you the listeners that are our intelligence network out there you it's
[37:58.360 --> 38:05.000]  hard to talk I'm watching an incredible squall come in into South Padre and it
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.360]  is just seafoam green with with black waves where the clouds are and I'm
[38:10.360 --> 38:16.040]  watching a big squall move like a little little like a little tornado over the
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.880]  water wow man I bet you're gonna see a bunch of surfer show up except it's a
[38:20.880 --> 38:24.920]  red top of dead fish everywhere you go outside it smells like Armageddon like
[38:24.920 --> 38:28.640]  death there's this giant dead fish and millions of meadows everywhere and
[38:28.640 --> 38:32.800]  little fish everywhere and the birds are falling dead that's in the newspaper
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.600]  today disoriented birds falling from sky it's like into the world next door
[38:38.600 --> 38:42.720]  there's this big skyscraper hotel to where I'm staying and every time I go
[38:42.720 --> 38:48.040]  outside about half the time I go outside there are hawks spinning and I looked it
[38:48.040 --> 38:51.080]  up it's not their mating season they're fighting over territory and
[38:51.080 --> 38:57.320]  there's hawks clawing each other and falling hundreds of feet down and then
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.600]  disengaging before the ground and of course the camera I brought was that in
[39:02.600 --> 39:09.440]  the Fed last Sunday and got rained on though and is broken I didn't know till
[39:09.440 --> 39:13.920]  we got here that it doesn't really work now it it keeps switching in and out of
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.400]  I've tried to dry it out so before I go out of town next weekend I'm going on a
[39:18.400 --> 39:22.520]  mission next weekend and I need to tell the procurement arm of info wars to buy
[39:22.520 --> 39:26.160]  me one more of those little new little sonys I love that shoot the high death
[39:26.160 --> 39:29.560]  that are small I forget the name of them we got to put this one in the shop but
[39:29.560 --> 39:33.320]  these cameras are so good they've we've got to have more of them they're only
[39:33.320 --> 39:39.040]  like 700 bucks they've got the power of a $50,000 camera it's just like those
[39:39.040 --> 39:42.800]  $3,000 Canon cameras people started using that we started using the shoot
[39:42.800 --> 39:48.520]  stuff that looks like 35 millimeter you know Hollywood quality and now it's a
[39:48.520 --> 39:53.560]  $700 Sony does that the problem is they warn you not to get sand or water in
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.080]  them they're very because the it's it's it's a direct sensor just like the human
[39:58.080 --> 40:02.920]  eye it doesn't go through a refracting mirror onto a sensor it's got a huge
[40:02.920 --> 40:08.200]  sensor it was big as the sensors in the in the in the Canon still cameras that
[40:08.200 --> 40:11.480]  shoot the best video and now they're coming out even more of these it's just
[40:11.480 --> 40:15.800]  it's just amazing with one of these little cameras with a microphone you can
[40:15.800 --> 40:20.440]  hook into it to get better sound you can do what cost listen to me carefully
[40:20.440 --> 40:28.600]  about $100,000 just five years ago $700 that is what is going to equalize the
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.800]  mainstream media with the alternative media that's the level playing field
[40:32.800 --> 40:39.680]  that's what's scaring the system so bad but when you're in the pouring rain for
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.480]  three hours umbrellas aren't going to save a camera so I guess we'd have the
[40:45.480 --> 40:50.320]  procurement guys use a military term get one of those and also try to get some
[40:50.320 --> 40:59.120]  little little little outfit for it little weatherization package I know we
[40:59.120 --> 41:03.440]  almost broke one of the big cannons out there in the rain and when we had it in
[41:03.440 --> 41:08.880]  a winter eyes little thing oh you see I am now absolutely digressing because this
[41:08.880 --> 41:11.520]  is the kind of stuff I'd be doing during the breaks I was in the office I'd be
[41:11.520 --> 41:14.760]  like my camera's broken send it to the repair shop if they can't fix it get me
[41:14.760 --> 41:19.000]  another one here let's do this oh what's going on all right order more top
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.120]  of Chico for the refrigerator excellent you know that's the type of stuff that
[41:22.120 --> 41:28.120]  would normally be going on you know I'm procrastinating getting to this next
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.120]  news item I'm gonna hit this news item then I'm gonna give the number out and
[41:32.120 --> 41:36.080]  take your calls to the bottom of the next hour and then I will summon my
[41:36.080 --> 41:42.120]  intellect because it is feeble and try to give you a full spectrum analysis of
[41:42.120 --> 41:48.760]  fashion furious the literal black arrow that could shoot down the dragon smog to
[41:48.760 --> 41:55.720]  use a hobbit analogy black arrow you have never failed my family in five
[41:55.720 --> 42:00.160]  generations now I send you forth on your final mission I don't remember exactly
[42:00.160 --> 42:06.920]  what they say the point is is that this is the black arrow that can shoot right
[42:06.920 --> 42:11.320]  into the dragon's belly and take it down if we use it but they're not going to
[42:11.320 --> 42:17.120]  want to use it as I keep telling you because Obama didn't do this he added
[42:17.120 --> 42:21.560]  the cherry on top the little goodie that I talked about a few weeks ago in that
[42:21.560 --> 42:31.520]  rant the best bite the shop in the in the gravy when he used it against the
[42:31.520 --> 42:38.600]  second amendment added another layer on it and so insiders blew the whistle
[42:38.600 --> 42:45.160]  that's what happened and it got so prolific and so ridiculous when ATF was
[42:45.160 --> 42:49.320]  ordered to deliver the drugs to the drug cartels and 18 wheelers and we're told
[42:49.320 --> 42:53.600]  don't worry we have a cover story that that they had fist fights it's now been
[42:53.600 --> 42:57.960]  reported people turning over chairs I mean it's gotten so criminal inside the
[42:57.960 --> 43:03.320]  ATF that it's broken into the other compartmentalized area of the white hat
[43:03.320 --> 43:09.440]  guys who are always the people you know in the lower room the the the porch
[43:09.440 --> 43:14.720]  government agents like the porch masons who aren't in the inner party kind of a
[43:14.720 --> 43:19.280]  Winston Smith and Orwell or Orwellville who's in the outer party and they've got
[43:19.280 --> 43:24.560]  the inner party that O'Brien's in that's actually how mafia organizations set
[43:24.560 --> 43:30.480]  themselves up throughout history so that's what's happening here that's
[43:30.480 --> 43:34.160]  what's going on and I'll be breaking that down at the bottom of the next hour
[43:34.160 --> 43:37.840]  and getting into the war news the fellow reserve news and more the toll-free
[43:37.840 --> 43:47.160]  number to join us is 800-259-9231-800-259-9231 on any of the issues I've
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.040]  covered in the last few days or any items or news issues you'd like to raise
[43:51.040 --> 43:58.720]  now getting back to this little gym this would never have been in the McAllen
[43:58.720 --> 44:06.840]  monitor because I've seen this myself literally hundreds of times if if talk
[44:06.840 --> 44:11.640]  radio hadn't covered it libertarian constitutional radio or at least
[44:11.640 --> 44:17.040]  something advertising itself is that I can't tell you how many times we've
[44:17.040 --> 44:20.120]  seen it where we break national stories most of the time we don't even get
[44:20.120 --> 44:24.840]  credit fine I don't care as long as it gets out there and in this case this is
[44:24.840 --> 44:30.840]  going on in every school district in America and it's not just Hispanics that
[44:30.840 --> 44:34.160]  think of themselves as Mexicans not Americans that are teaching it it is
[44:34.160 --> 44:39.360]  gringos that are teaching it it's Ford Foundation fake liberal ideology by the
[44:39.360 --> 44:44.440]  biggest banks and corporations in this country financing people at each other
[44:44.440 --> 44:48.880]  throats the last thing they want is Mexicans to take on part of the American
[44:48.880 --> 44:56.960]  culture imagine 1776 slapped on the back of the you know hard-working tough you
[44:56.960 --> 45:04.080]  know male-driven ombre idea that is old classical Mexico got a lot of
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.760]  admirable things there you think they want 1776 running through that blood
[45:08.760 --> 45:14.120]  you think they want that idea by the way they being down here I've seen all
[45:14.120 --> 45:18.240]  the they had a big Mexican bike rally down here along with a big general bike
[45:18.240 --> 45:22.800]  rally and I noticed that the white guys from their bike rally is that a bunch of
[45:22.800 --> 45:26.160]  you know rallies under at the same time we're all wearing like kiss shirts and
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.760]  heavy metal shirts even the older men trying to act trendy most of the
[45:29.760 --> 45:33.760]  Mexicans were actually wearing red white blue and American Eagles and see
[45:33.760 --> 45:37.680]  those are folks that understand that's a good thing compared to everything else
[45:37.680 --> 45:41.880]  it's out there and that that's that that's a good culture to buy into it's
[45:41.880 --> 45:47.840]  an idea of liberty and freedom now the system doesn't want that they don't want
[45:47.840 --> 45:52.440]  Hispanics buying into 1776 like I'll tell you how to end the corruption out of
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.360]  Mexico if everybody was armed down there they wouldn't have this culture of
[45:57.360 --> 46:01.480]  corruption grow up and if everybody was armed down there you wouldn't have
[46:01.480 --> 46:06.400]  cartels that come to the door of people and just randomly kill them because
[46:06.400 --> 46:09.160]  they're running their own business or because they won't be conscripts to work
[46:09.160 --> 46:15.440]  for the cartel you know every person in Mexico had a gun which the general public
[46:15.440 --> 46:22.840]  doesn't and used it this would end overnight that's why you've seen the
[46:23.800 --> 46:29.960]  classic mafia operating in places like Chicago New York Detroit where there
[46:29.960 --> 46:33.880]  were generally in new wave immigrant populations the last you know going back
[46:33.880 --> 46:37.760]  a hundred years ago who'd come from countries where they were controlled by
[46:37.760 --> 46:42.280]  local mafias and so it was just business as usual you did not have a lot of
[46:42.280 --> 46:46.880]  mafia type good old boy stuff and you've seen a lot of famous western movies
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.120]  where the bad sheriff takes over in the town folks overthrow them those are
[46:50.120 --> 46:54.840]  based on hundreds of real stories they call them brush fire rebellions and a
[46:54.840 --> 46:58.160]  lot of times establishment types the railroad others would come and kill
[46:58.160 --> 47:02.320]  somebody for their land and people you know the general folks that had fought
[47:02.320 --> 47:05.320]  the British and come over here to get away from tyranny they just started
[47:05.320 --> 47:12.200]  killing people that's the 1776 we're not bowing down we're not licking your
[47:12.200 --> 47:17.840]  boots the police very polite you know everybody knew what this country was
[47:17.840 --> 47:23.520]  about not perfect but compared everybody else the best that is the last thing they
[47:23.520 --> 47:27.680]  don't want Mexicans coming over here and becoming Americans they don't want that
[47:27.680 --> 47:31.840]  they don't want them adopting red white and blue guns freedom private property
[47:31.840 --> 47:37.160]  something that Hispanics of cultures I've seen out there absolutely gravitate
[47:37.160 --> 47:41.440]  towards and want no no no they're not gonna let that marriage maiden have it
[47:41.440 --> 47:47.240]  happen they're not gonna let that happen so they cram and ram la reconquista
[47:47.240 --> 47:51.560]  metia rasa junk you don't ever hear him saying whites can have a college fund
[47:51.560 --> 47:55.120]  or something or no no no it's only quote minorities to keep them in a group
[47:55.120 --> 48:00.160]  under the globalist control on their plantation and the drug cartels are all
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.480]  about metia la rasa you know the group the race is what the rasa means and
[48:05.480 --> 48:10.720]  radio stations called la infesora the invasion la reconquista the reconquering
[48:10.720 --> 48:15.680]  this is what's taught this is what I was taught at Anderson I in two classes by
[48:15.680 --> 48:21.240]  white people all Ford Foundation funded it later came out and that's why it's
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.640]  now in the McCallan monitor never would have been there local news all knows
[48:26.640 --> 48:32.040]  about this you can go to any Spanish class in this country that I've seen and
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.960]  it's being taught because it's the curriculum it's the curriculum by the
[48:36.960 --> 48:40.560]  big banks this is what they want they want to set each other's throats I mean
[48:40.560 --> 48:44.800]  endorsing what is known now is the quote Mexican culture corruption drugs
[48:44.800 --> 48:50.280]  people groveling destruction of freedom humans uses slaves forced off their land
[48:50.280 --> 48:54.520]  this is what we're told this is what's taught in schools it says there they
[48:54.520 --> 48:58.240]  there's video of it they they give the Mexican anthem national anthem they
[48:58.240 --> 49:02.680]  pledge allegiance to Mexico they're taught Mexican history they're taught
[49:02.680 --> 49:08.880]  about the la reconquista and that and about the evil gringo now now now that's
[49:08.880 --> 49:12.600]  what's taught in America and here it is in the newspaper now that it's a
[49:12.600 --> 49:17.960]  national story it says here it says now that because it's a national news
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.840]  story it's being covered Spanish classes riles parent what about Spanish class is
[49:23.840 --> 49:29.720]  treason it is coming in saying overthrow this government I mean my whole
[49:29.720 --> 49:34.120]  life lived in Spain for six years but she speaks fluent Spanish and and reads it
[49:34.120 --> 49:40.080]  on the the little Mexican grocery stores the bodegas she'll be driving to the
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.800]  countryside she's like what is that what is this sometimes we'll listen to the
[49:43.800 --> 49:48.240]  Mexican radio in Austin and it's all these jokes because it's in another language
[49:48.240 --> 49:51.760]  so people so people that speak English don't know this is going on it's a
[49:51.760 --> 49:57.160]  perfect way to try to turn Hispanics into a giant Ku Klux Klan group against
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.800]  white people and divide the country which is what the globalist want here it
[50:01.800 --> 50:04.960]  is the school says there was nothing wrong with having students recite
[50:04.960 --> 50:09.280]  Mexican pledge of allegiance and anthem an assignment for a high school Spanish
[50:09.280 --> 50:12.320]  class that made students recite the Mexican pledge of allegiance and
[50:12.320 --> 50:16.520]  national anthem as upset apparent I don't see a connection between all this
[50:16.520 --> 50:22.160]  Mexican history and the allegiance and the national anthem and learning
[50:22.160 --> 50:28.640]  Spanish said William E. Brinson said an interview with conservative radio host
[50:28.640 --> 50:34.440]  Glenn Beck yesterday I find it appalling the indoctrination that is going on
[50:34.440 --> 50:38.320]  down here to the 47 year old truck driver who was instructed his 15 year old
[50:38.320 --> 50:44.960]  daughter to take a video recording of the exercise at McCallins Hurley College

[55:32.720 --> 55:36.760]  now admitted the head of the committee yes the congressman says it was going
[55:36.760 --> 55:40.440]  under in the Bush administration oh you mean Iran Contra was going on during
[55:40.440 --> 55:45.680]  Reagan oh you mean guns were being shipped out of the country and heroin
[55:45.680 --> 55:52.480]  back in in the 1950s out of Vietnam that was called Indochina the US had ships
[55:52.480 --> 55:55.400]  that landed an aircraft that landed the French loaded it on there were
[55:55.400 --> 55:58.560]  congressional hearings about that in the 70s there were congressional hearings
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.960]  in the late 90s where the CIA inspector general admitted our government ships the
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.800]  majority of cocaine in and launders it in US banks because Congress actually had
[56:06.800 --> 56:14.040]  a meeting about it and now our troops go on national news Heraldo Fox ABC BBC I've
[56:14.040 --> 56:17.960]  played all the newscast here and say yes we help grow the opium and then we
[56:17.960 --> 56:23.840]  help ship it out out of Afghanistan and there's no discussion about but then you
[56:23.840 --> 56:29.960]  put people in jail for using it humans are addicted our addictive personalities
[56:29.960 --> 56:34.920]  that we have it chemically the system knows so they put out oxy cotton for
[56:34.920 --> 56:39.280]  people that are into legal drugs and they put out methamphetamine for those
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.600]  that are into illegal and cocaine heroin and they bring it in and they keep it
[56:44.600 --> 56:48.660]  illegal to keep the price high and then they put you in their private prisons
[56:48.660 --> 56:52.400]  working for 25 cents an hour displacing the workers everybody loves to
[56:52.400 --> 56:55.440]  complain about illegal aliens grabbing our wages and being all welfare and I'm
[56:55.440 --> 56:58.680]  here to complain about it I don't like paying for it I'm sick of it especially
[56:58.680 --> 57:04.640]  I get a Mexican flag waved in my face all day but I'm smart enough to understand
[57:04.640 --> 57:09.400]  the social engineering that did it and I'm smart enough to know that it's the
[57:09.400 --> 57:13.160]  real thing taking our jobs is the four million people working for 25 cents an
[57:13.160 --> 57:17.520]  hour or less in all these private prison industries which in every case are owned
[57:17.520 --> 57:21.960]  by big mega banks known to water the drug money I'm gonna say it again the drug
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.240]  dealers bring the drugs in their agents the police bring you to jail their
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.400]  agents the judges put you in jail the goody-to-shoe juries go along with it
[57:30.400 --> 57:38.560]  and you're put in a jail and in a prison run and profited by the drug dealers I
[57:38.560 --> 57:44.560]  know I've talked about this for a long time but it's now out what I told you
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.120]  six eight months ago Bush is involved and it goes right back to Clinton it goes
[57:49.120 --> 57:54.440]  right back it never stopped 1832 British Monopoly skull and bones opium to
[57:54.440 --> 57:58.120]  this country when the monopoly got broken in the 30s they made it illegal in the
[57:58.120 --> 58:03.040]  U.S. before they could just control it out of India but the French started
[58:03.040 --> 58:09.960]  taking it out after that out of Indochina and so they had to make it
[58:09.960 --> 58:15.040]  illegal they had to make it illegal so they can make more money when you run
[58:15.040 --> 58:19.360]  it in your veins it's so important to them now we're gonna go to break we're

[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.600]  blood and they come back completely you know freaked out and are now pulling you
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.720]  in your family over while your car's not you know if you're violating something
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.440]  in the street you have to be pulled over I mean but that that's one thing but
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.680]  yeah you've got to be pulled over for having the inspection sticker out by
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.680]  one week but if you're a big bank wandering hundreds of billions of
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.680]  dollars and running giant child kidnapping rings well that's okay a guy
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:33.040]  that was in the SS in 1940 is he's 84 years 83 years old now he was in the
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:39.520]  SS for six weeks over in Germany and all I know German people a lot of Germans
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.960]  and they're very good with their hands you know what I mean they're very good
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:51.160]  at doing things that most of the German people and it seems like if you see a
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:59.600]  German person on the police department you know you were an Italian guy it just
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.520]  isn't the same anymore like it was 40 years ago like you're implying that
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.720]  they're a bunch of Nazis no I'm not implying they're all a bunch of Nazis
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.640]  what the federal government is doing the social engineering is an us against
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.120]  them militarized police against the public that's what they're pushing and
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.640]  they're trying to get police to do things that are unconstitutional and the
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.480]  feds are creating their own branch the TSA and saying they're above the law that
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.320]  can and can radiate you and stick their hands down your pants so I'm against
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.440]  what they're being asked to do what they're being turned into no I'm the
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.960]  police are in the very same hot water we're all in they all live in this

[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:22.560]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.320]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:37.440]  big developments if you just joined us it was big news yesterday made national
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:43.200]  news and then they finally reported on it locally here on the south Texas the
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.520]  local monitor newspaper reported that in McCallan they have the high school
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:54.720]  students pledge allegiance to Mexico and stand for the Mexican Pledge of
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.760]  Allegiance and of course they're also taught the U.S. really belongs to
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.280]  Mexico and is evil the point is that's taught in colleges that's taught
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.840]  everywhere I mean I've seen it's got to be in the 20s or 30s articles over the
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.840]  years where kids are having to salute the Mexican flag and American flags aren't
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.520]  allowed and this is taught everywhere this was this was taught when I was in
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.240]  high school it was just that America was bad and Mexico control the Southwest and
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.400]  Lori Conquista was good we were taking the UT as seniors in high school to be
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:30.520]  brainwashed and I got up and said this isn't true and they freaked out and they
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:34.400]  had to call the teacher side that the UT professor and said how well who is this
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.440]  person you know that they were very concerned I might be some type of evil
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.840]  radical because I actually had two brain cells to rub together and that was
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:52.480]  20 years ago 20 yeah 20 years ago wow 20 years ago was it more than 20 years
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.360]  ago I'm getting old here folks it's been more time I've been out of high school
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:02.280]  that I was you know before just amazing time flies alright I want to take your
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:08.960]  calls also it's it's being reported all over the United States County City
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.440]  layoffs and they're also laying off police and the police they're keeping
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.160]  this is a long trend but it's getting serious now are only there to revenue
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.440]  generate they actually say this we're here to collect money from you so we
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.440]  got jobs we're not here to respond to crimes and everything's got to go to the
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.400]  federal government you know or to the derivatives because your county and
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.280]  city invested in the derivatives by the Bankster Madoff types the Kenley types
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.000]  and now it's over and so taxes go up but you get less services that's
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.360]  austerity and the media has tried to point to a bunch of well-meaning hippies
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.520]  and people you know with signs saying redistributor else redistribute or
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:53.080]  violence redistributor revolution redistribute how about in corporate
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:56.640]  welfare how about in the private Federal Reserve that engineered this
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:02.000]  economic problem we've got so much industry so much so many ideas so much
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.560]  desire for commerce that as long as you have freedom your country is going to be
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.040]  a great place to live but we've let the globalists make drugs illegal so they
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.440]  can bring them in and create a crime culture and put people in prison we've
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:18.480]  let them ship our jobs to China where the globalist have made deals where they
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.720]  can operate and others can't to drive down our wages we've let them create a
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.720]  giant prison industry with four million plus people working for 25 cents an hour
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.600]  or less to drive down our wages but we've allowed a giant government complex to
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.560]  grow and now they keep taxing and taxing and then it doesn't matter how much
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.400]  they tax everything falls apart so we're now to that point let's go to your phone
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.320]  calls let's talk to Nick in New Hampshire thanks for holding hey mr. Jones how are
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:53.720]  you I am good it is good to talk to you today welcome thank you for taking my
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:12:01.960]  call thank you Friday on my drive home from work listen radio and I caught a
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:11.600]  story it was small story that on Wednesday last week president Obama sent
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:21.720]  special forces to central Africa and I just thought that was you know kind of
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:29.480]  weird I did a little more investigating and found of all places of CNN story it's
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:36.360]  under the CNN world section and they quote is a quote from the article the
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.760]  group could perhaps be described as a small-time Christian version of al-Qaeda
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:48.240]  led by Joseph crook at Joseph Connie a cult-like figure as equal as equally
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.240]  delusional as the former a q al-Qaeda and mere or some of them Latin you know
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.240]  no that's what they do they they just say these Ron Paul supporters are like
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.520]  al-Qaeda and their internal police training manuals are now all the new TV
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:08.160]  ads it's white al-Qaeda the minorities are reporting them al-Qaeda is just a
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:12.000]  label they put on anything they want and yes they're there going after quote
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.680]  Christians in Uganda to displace them with animus Muslims and others it's the
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:22.320]  same thing in other parts of that area they'll play off one tribe against
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.240]  another who to's against to see's what but generally the UN sides against
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:34.680]  Christians and it's all about resource wars and look in our film the Obama
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.400]  deception been out for almost three years I keep tooting our horn we show
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.840]  troops invading Africa starting in Libya with african and say that Obama is the
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.680]  blackface put in there given the peace prize he just been given it when that
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:54.080]  film came out so that it would be seen as if well he's a man of peace I mean you
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.400]  know the army tank is painted rainbow colors so even though it's running over
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.480]  the top of us it must be all right they're invading ivory coast gold coast
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:11.080]  Uganda Sudan Somalia Libya they're about to do operations in Tunisia they've
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.120]  overthrown their old dictator in Egypt they they wanted to use Libya and those
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:20.600]  giant airfields in that water supply Libya was building up all of Africa to
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:27.200]  shut off the resources to Africa the water and and machinery and oil and to
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.080]  then project power they've already got drones 24-7 just killing palmel dropping
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.840]  love bombs dropping peace bombs and yeah so so what did you think of Obama's
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.120]  great african safari as one of our writers called it this weekend oh it's
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.960]  it's crazy I haven't I actually haven't I didn't catch that article but I wasn't
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:54.920]  sure if info wars was I had reported on this yet it's it's just when I heard
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:59.320]  that and I immediately thought you know Africa have a lot of resources you know
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.880]  immediately I just went to it because of but they're out but to serve their
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:08.400]  Christian al-Qaeda they've got to be killed there's gold mines in that area and
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.920]  uh you know the article goes on to say that uh well they you know they'll
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:19.120]  paraphrase the only thing that Obama has to risk is you know maybe maybe death you
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:24.520]  know American death but but because of this battlefield is is Africa you know
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:30.040]  it's not quantity it's quality and the death should be limited you know and as
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.640]  to say oh that that totally vindicates and justifies going into Africa but sir
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:42.760]  he is part black and a liberal so it's good listen when he drops a bomb on a
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:48.800]  wedding and kills 200 people to kill one quote al-Qaeda that's peace sir and you
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.000]  know Cheney was wrong for waterboarding people that was evil and horrible Obama
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.600]  said but actually blowing women and children up everywhere that's good sir
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:02.240]  sir you're a right-wing extremist aren't you I mean you're not for war and just
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.040]  invading all of Africa and killing everybody I mean the UN just got caught
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:11.720]  again in Africa the the UN just got caught in Uganda just two weeks ago
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.880]  Paul Watson wrote about this with a private mercenaries burning down whole

[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.280]  Vietnam veteran I had a chance to meet you there in front of the Federal Reserve
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.520]  in Houston during the protest to meet you my friend and one thing about that
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.680]  building it amazed me Alex that's one of the scariest looking buildings I've
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.560]  ever seen it it almost looked like secret police headquarters instead of a bank
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.240]  you know it did kind of look it was it was royal purple instead of green it
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.520]  kind of looked like MI6 headquarters in London it did look like a dungeon keeper
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.480]  facility with pyramids and eagles on top pyramids and everything yeah very
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.800]  loving I wanted you know the Wall Street protesters sitting there saying they
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:14.640]  want to bring socialism to America and I don't see why they're complaining cuz
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.680]  we're already under a social system already that you look at the back we
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.920]  already pay about 60% some form of tax but don't worry Herman Cain's got a VAT
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.680]  and a sales tax federally run having the feds snooping and everything you do I
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.080]  think that's wonderful you look at the background go to Google and type in
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:35.680]  Obama's communist connections the stuff just rolls out of there you look at all
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.760]  the people bush surrounded themselves with the neocons they're described as
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:44.120]  Trotsky communist we see like everybody we get a prayer but any president gets up
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:48.920]  there all he does is it's around himself what he's left is the people and the
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:53.360]  bankers started communism but when they started communism it was never about
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.560]  Russia or China it was always about globalization internationalism control
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:02.240]  and what they do is they come in international banks fund and this has
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.960]  been going they funded marks and angles it's on record that was declassified
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.560]  came out in US government documents in the 50s and the 70s and you're
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.040]  absolutely right Norman Dodd committee exposed it and on record we'll talk

[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.800]  everything announced themselves in Moscow as the government then the US and
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.960]  England fund them over several years to take over the Russia like they're doing
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.080]  in Libya right now and then they start the mass extermination of Christians and
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:47.040]  middle-class that's what all this is about that's what it's always about so

[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:32.680]  millions dead you can pull it up and his books he says yes I put Pol Pot in and
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.840]  helped him and we couldn't kill millions but Pol Pot sure could when we helped
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:42.080]  him real funny a little legal term I didn't kill millions I just gave him the
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:49.280]  funds and the and the resources to do it I didn't kill anybody I just flipped
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.200]  the switch and open the open the trapdoor and then the rope around their
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.240]  neck and their own gravity broke their neck you know the executioner I didn't

[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.480]  will get in just like Mexico until it's just people worshiping grim reapers
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:24.520]  40,000 dead total insanity running around killing each other this is what
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.920]  happens when civilization falls apart this is what happens when good people
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.960]  stop being involved and I'm sorry to be ranting John I'm gonna give you the last
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.280]  word and hold you over if you got a break here but unless you can finish it's
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.720]  just that you bring up red terror and stuff yes that's what they have planned
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:42.040]  here they're gonna unleash the dumb moron public school people that want a job
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:44.920]  they don't know it's globalism that destroyed them and they're gonna turn
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.840]  them loose on everybody the whole society will fall apart and the globalists
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.760]  will sit offshore in their armored mansions in private islands while their
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.400]  secret police kill millions of us and then they'll come back later and take
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:59.600]  everything over if we don't get the word out it's all over this is what's
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.280]  gonna happen final comments on that yeah I guess that's one of the things I was
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:07.360]  thinking about it one of the scams that the globalist could run it be like the
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.160]  Spanish Civil War where the the military rose up to save us from the
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.880]  communists and it instituted a fascist regime with a with a Franco running it
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:19.680]  you know we could go that's how they always do it they give you a commie or
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.160]  they give you a fascist and it's all black uniforms and collectivism that's

[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:22.080]  man that is awesome use and i'm so proud of the fact that for now a couple years on their official site
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.920]  they are big fans of this show i've interviewed Bellamy before but the only links they have are
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:39.280]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com at least last time i checked and when glenn back came out and endorsed him and said he loved them they put a message out saying we don't want to be endorsed by you
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.960]  but when i had Bellamy on i didn't think to even get his number and then didn't even try to get him back on for like a year later
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:56.960]  and uh once we tried to get him a hold of him i mean no way to get through his management because you know they're getting hit with they just get bigger and bigger total superstars
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.520]  but it doesn't matter i just want to get him back on the show we feel the love from far away
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:07.120]  and Bellamy's also worn info or shirts on stage terrorist storm he's made handmade ones
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:15.200]  plug in our films on national tv we will be victorious we've got to unite and watch our flag ascend
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:24.640]  but Matthew Bellamy i mean he makes tens of millions of dollars a year because people want to buy his music should should he have to
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:35.840]  give his money away i mean i'm sure he lives in england they pay more than 60 percent in one form of tax or another is it okay for bellamy to keep 40 percent of his money and hire and employ all these people
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:41.680]  is he a bad guy because he's rich now because his ideas were popular that's what freedom is all about
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.240]  you know this idea of collectivism i've seen novels and short films out there
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:57.840]  can't place the name at the time of you know a nightmare future where somebody's tall and handsome so they deform their face or somebody's an athlete so they cut their hamstring
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.280]  where everybody has all these weird things attached to them to to to make sure everybody's the same
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:11.360]  all of us have certain gifts that others don't have i have the gift of discernment of analysis
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:20.960]  but without love as Corinthians i was reading Corinthians this morning and i meant to come over to this room where we're doing the show out of and read from Corinthians today
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:30.320]  in fact i'm going to call richard right now i think he's over at the other room and to bring my bible over here i'm sorry we don't want to hear the bible
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:38.160]  but i was reading Corinthians with my children this morning and uh i don't fault the bible i just know it's beautiful
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:45.840]  uh let me call richard here real quick well you guys are there uh i know my wife's out of the room she went to the grocery store
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.440]  but you guys call richard and tell him don't go to a bunch of trouble
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:59.280]  but before pachennic comes on if we have time uh get my son's workbook where we were doing we were copying uh
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.560]  Corinthians that way it'll all be there and real simple and just a few lines i want to read uh but um
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:13.360]  as it was love when you stop loving your fellow humanity everything turns into a cesspool everything falls apart
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:20.480]  and when you do care about others so when you care about truth and justice it creates a better and better society
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:29.600]  and we have a world run by very cold-blooded wicked people uh a lot of them aren't even cold-blooded they're very hot-blooded they're wicked and enjoy hurting people
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:38.400]  and enjoy ugliness and enjoy pain and enjoy lies and enjoy degradation and they try to sell us on torture and gladiatorial events and
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.160]  all of this but then they target others you know we want to take care of you where the nanny
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:52.000]  nanny state uh situation now i want to go back to your calls and then into fast and furious and then some other news
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.080]  uh i have here robots to aid troop patrols told you that's coming this is very dangerous trend
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.760]  because it's it's going to phase out humans and then the globalists can have their own private mechanized armies that will follow orders
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:11.440]  also budget cuts hit uh county city jobs payroll uh losses add to us jobless rate i want to get into that
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.960]  i haven't talked enough about this new york times cover story today
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:23.920]  i mean just look at that just amazing um talking about the fact that the protests are really very diverse
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:31.200]  it's got in the fed it's got reform corporate welfare it's got young educated unemployed that is a big part of folks that are upset
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.440]  stop the wars uh a lady that has one says i'm very upset
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:41.440]  and it says countless grievances one thread we're angry and then they got a guy down here in the lower left hand corner
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:46.560]  wearing an info wars dot com obama limited edition obama joker shirt
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.640]  you know we've had so many people ask us to bring that back but i promised it was limited edition
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.640]  so we haven't offered that in over a year
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.600]  but i think we ought to come out with whoever the republican nominee is on the back
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:04.080]  as a joker
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.680]  because it's such an iconic image and whoever and then and then obama on the front
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:13.760]  in fact that's something i want to tell tim for jade to uh get on the ball with so we want to get that out
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.400]  the great job the crew does there in the back with our graphics people
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:23.520]  maybe have cake one with a new obama joker iconic and then a new uh whoever the republican nominee is unless it's ron paul
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.760]  and uh
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.880]  we come up with something with ron paul's good but then the joker's bad who knows
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.680]  uh but down here in the lower left hand corner he's wearing the obama joker shirt
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.280]  and then it says war is not the answer nine levels an inside job i don't believe the liberal media
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:48.240]  um impeach supreme court corporations are not the people
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:57.200]  and no nukes with a live for your die info wars dot com sticker and the 911 inside job sticker is also an info wars dot com
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.440]  prison planet dot com sticker
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:02.480]  see that
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:10.320]  that's just awesome and yes i have radio listeners always emailing what do you mean look at that
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.680]  we're on the radio here that's where we reach the line share of our audience is amon fm xm but
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:23.840]  i'm a global shortwave w w c r but we're also streaming to prison planet dot tv viewers at prison planet dot tv and there's also prison planet
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.040]  nightly news their info wars nightly news at prison planet dot tv or info wars news dot com
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.240]  okay i'll get into fast and furious these other reports and then pacenics coming up to finish up what he was talking about friday
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:40.080]  uh coming up here in the last 30 minutes of the next hour but let's go to tim in wisconsin let's move quick now
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.240]  to get to everybody go ahead tim
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.360]  all right out to a few um great ideas and stuff well first of all you know like about like the city bank and the one way
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.840]  they got arrested i think all info wars listeners
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.320]  should close other city accounts and if there's any local businesses that do business in the city
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:58.560]  tell them you're not gonna you know patronize them as long as you business with that and show them the video that
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.240]  because i'll just discuss it so i'm glad you called about that because i mentioned that yesterday on
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.280]  the radio and on tv but i didn't make a big enough deal about it
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.920]  we should probably do a news report tonight if we have time
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.400]  it turns out the uh
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:16.960]  washington blog at info wars dot com we posted it found a whole bunch of examples of people being arrested trying to shut their accounts
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:20.160]  and police just pour in and say it's a disturbance
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.520]  and and and the people
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:30.480]  i mean banks are trying to not give people their money and this is very dangerous though because they want to have a bank holiday
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.840]  and they love to shut the banks down and blame it on the people
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:39.040]  then devalue the currency over a week and then you can get your money out it's just devalued now
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.480]  i mean who knows what they're gonna pull the people certainly have a right to get their money out
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.560]  i mean what do you think of all these videos
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.600]  there's a whole bunch a whole bunch of bank you're doing
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:58.720]  well um what i think you know everyone needs to do is all these big banks has canceled their accounts to just go a local credit union
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.720]  and then what else i think is uh
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:02.320]  um
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.600]  you know like
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.560]  well basically like any local businesses should just boycott them if they're you know using a city bank and then just
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.720]  you know have them cancel their accounts or switch so
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.320]  well my audio was choppy this skype works pretty good, but it breaks up a few times a day
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:20.800]  that's why we're on the road testing it out as we're getting ready to go on the road with speaking engagements and things
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.080]  but we're able to hear my comment and my question though that
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.360]  there's a whole bunch of this going on where banks won't give people their money
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.440]  it's pretty crazy and stuff i think both the big banks just need to
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.680]  pull out you know all of your funds over the accounts and stuff that's what i'm gonna
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:40.560]  you know do and i just switched to a local credit union that's what i'm doing right now is transferring for my bank accounts at credit union
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.120]  and then what else people like should do is i
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:48.160]  um is like say any local businesses are doing business with you know city group or any of the other uh
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.600]  you know big banks just put pressure on to move to a small town bank or credit union and move their funds
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:56.240]  you know from the big banks i think that will definitely hurt them and then uh
[01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:00.240]  i don't maybe call like a city group and put them on notice at info wars you know
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.400]  all their 13 million listeners are just going to be boycotting and closing their accounts and stuff
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.840]  um i think they'll maybe make them regret you know doing that to lake it'll just awful
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.880]  police state tactics and no no i agree with you uh
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.320]  city group uh the city bank bank of america wells fargo uh
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.720]  goldman sachet and morgan these are the groups uh and um
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.480]  um we've got our stuff in a texas bank we actually have
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:29.840]  some in one of the big mega banks we can do international things because a lot of
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:34.080]  local banks won't do international or it's next year impossible like to pay
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.120]  Watson and his brother and people but we've got to move towards
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:42.960]  well i am in the local credit union as well that's most important your local banks are the lifeblood of the community
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:47.600]  they're actually loaning money helping people we need to support those and get out of the big mega banks
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.920]  i totally agree with you good to hear from you
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.320]  okay let's go ahead and talk to hulio in illinois hulio welcome

[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:55.520]  attack iran but look they wanted to attack us and now it turns out of course it's all made up baloney
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.520]  that whole plot was fake so the green light has dimmed quite a bit and we may not see that strike
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.960]  happen the problem is now they're talking about more iranian fake plots they're going to bring out so
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:14.160]  they don't have maneuvers going on in and around iran right now for nothing and congressman kane
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:20.240]  calling for war for nothing this is what elements of israel and the u.s government want right now
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.040]  well diversion but i'm getting back to what you're talking about for those that haven't seen it i know
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.320]  we linked to it last week at info wars dot com and also on the alex jones youtube channel uh you
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:34.800]  did a great job asking herman kane real questions in fact i meant to play that clip i'm going from
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:41.120]  memory here but doesn't he say i don't agree with bernacky right now i don't like all of this
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.560]  printing money out of thin air uh doesn't he say that word for word media
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:53.360]  that has you know the fed has a dual mission right now and we need to get get them back to sound
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:47:00.240]  economic policy or sound money stealing ron paul's words and you know he's just you know i got
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:04.320]  here's what i'm saying though i've seen a herman kane quote i mean i was asking a question about
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:14.640]  that though i've seen a herman kane quote uh julio where uh herman kane says listen i work for the
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.960]  federal reserve we need to get it back to its you know roll we need to shrink it well its rolls
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.560]  never to be shrunk and he said uh we need you know we don't need to just printing money out of thin air
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:31.200]  what do you think it's always done and it doesn't just current money the federal government could do
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:36.320]  that then it's we want better or not these are debt notes debt instruments like the rudas putting
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.520]  us into slavery every dollar that's printed so i know there's a video clip i saw it this weekend
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:47.280]  i meant to send it to jaren but never did i think it's your video where he says i don't think we
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:50.960]  should have the federal reserve just printing money out of thin air i know there's a quote of
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:54.720]  him saying that well what do you think the federal reserve does that's my point elio
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:00.800]  yeah tim was the one who uh added the video he did a great job and he beat herman kane was saying
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:07.040]  that the federal reserve was working well from 1913 till about 2000 and then this is when the only
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.560]  time the federal reserve has done something wrong was printing money out of thin air and talking about
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:17.600]  alan greensband the traitor uh you know the liberty movement it's just it's just boggling
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.400]  alex really to see herman kane at one point talking about how he loves the constitution
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.560]  and then the next point defending the federal reserve and really alex that was the only one
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:31.520]  asking tough questions to herman kane and i hope i can go to isle rick the adulterer perry is going
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:37.120]  to be there at a christian conference i'd like to ask him some real questions and uh and well
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:43.920]  look i mean look the whole reported adultery thing has been improved i mean you can ask
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:52.240]  them to be attention uh but i would go with uh some of the other issues i would i would go after
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:49:01.600]  perry on hey why don't you support al gore for president uh why don't you support hillary care
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.960]  it's those type of questions that he needs to be put on the hot seat for but listen let's expand on
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:12.640]  that what about mitt romney's of the children whose obama's science are who openly want pockett
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.440]  mills water to sterilize us and wants to cut off our resources i mean oh romney is for abortion
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:24.800]  disarming the citizens uh he wrote obama care and this is the republican program
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:34.800]  this is to fox is in the united states wanted bill o'reilly mr mr vat tax and and you know to pay
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.920]  off and and and national sales tax which herman kane is promoting but look herman kane is saying
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:46.000]  i like green span it's green span that that put him on you know as the head there or got congress to
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:51.360]  it was green span got rid of glass steagle it was green span that created the derivatives
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:56.560]  it was green span that did all of this it was green span that set up the biggest Ponzi scheme
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:04.720]  bubble and herman kane knows that do you think billio you can tell he was uncomfortable while i was
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:11.600]  asking these questions it's just absolutely absurd that here we are again they're offering
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:17.600]  someone who is in the user true insider as ron paul said at best alex it's just sickening that
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:22.080]  people are getting con but what about when he said ron paul was a liar and said i didn't call
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:28.480]  people that want to audit the fed stupid and then there's the quote in his book calling him stupid
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:32.320]  you can tell he's afraid of ron paul they're all afraid of ron paul he's been fighting the fed

[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:39.280]  and uh their bills and even if the security people are private contractors i would assume
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:47.600]  them it's american tax dollars paying the bills uh the other thing most important there is currently

[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:53.520]  to hear from you on that front fill we know that hundreds of billions of dollars since the 40s
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:57:00.880]  have been spent in the u.s on deep underground military bases continuity of government c o g
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:07.600]  uh and we know that the american people are not allowed to have the details of those whereas in
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:12.080]  switzerland and other areas they have access to them with their tax money you know we paid to build
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.920]  it but during a nuclear war a bio weapon release we're supposed to just crawl into our houses with
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:23.200]  our kids and our grandkids and roll over and die and then you've got all these level four
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:27.600]  bio weapons labs all over the u.s brewing up stuff that's incredibly deadly and you've got
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:31.360]  john p holder and talking about how great it would be to kill everybody and all these other
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:35.360]  globalists uh it's it's not going to be terrorists that release the bio weapon it's going to be the
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:40.400]  globalists who are the real terrorists so uh i know a lot about deep underground bases and
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:46.000]  their funding and the and the big systems that build the tunnels the underground railroads i know
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:53.120]  about systems under berkstrom airport that go out to ford hood and other areas i know bush's uh
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:58.560]  uh ranch was reportedly built on top of one that's why they bought that property out there
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:03.760]  outside waco but i only know about that because i had family in austin in the 50s when some of that
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:07.840]  was being built and i've talked to family in the military that knows about it but won't discuss it
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:14.640]  i mean they've got underground base snorkels sticking up in south austin uh so uh i mean i
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:23.360]  mean i really i mean i should do a whole news report on that though for the nightly news soon okay

[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:18.480]  now it goes back to the bush administration that's why they can't bring obama down you always wonder
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:23.840]  why one president won't bring down another president in the last 25 30 years because
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:29.360]  they're all puppets basically so they'll play with it for political power or use a scandal
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:36.080]  to blackmail somebody but they'll only go that far um i'll break that down coming up right now
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:42.480]  let's go to michael and indiana thanks for holding michael oh thank you yeah um my brother
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:46.320]  and i we listened to you guys a lot on the podcast about that i've been listening to you guys on the
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:53.200]  phone um a couple questions i actually had was that um the whole time military thing going on
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:58.480]  about down in mexico now is our military involved with that or do we have any national army going
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:05.680]  over there to help out or what's going on i forget the number but but yeah it's in the tens of billions
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:12.560]  a year in military aid the u.s gives mexico because i and with them being on the attack
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.200]  out of the border so basically i and we don't really have our actual national army over there
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.040]  we don't we just very very much what just happened our police department take care of it
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:31.200]  well most of police departments are told either take money and basically protect us
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:37.120]  or we're going to kill you and your family uh down here on the border and they've had congressional
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:45.600]  hearings on this i would say over 50 of the police are active drug smugglers that is detectives and
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:57.440]  above and the other 50 or so 25 turn a blind eye and the other 25 or so low level uh they're basically
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:04.320]  just office staff and and outright and tickets uh to keep the lights on in the building uh so
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.880]  i mean half the police down here and that's a conservative estimate that they're constantly
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.920]  getting caught but they're not getting in trouble about half the police on the border are are serious
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:20.720]  narcotics traffickers half the sheriffs in fact it's probably more like 75 percent are in most big
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:28.720]  cities um any police officer of any level uh who's in narcotics or or detective role is taking
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:39.440]  money but not just for narcotics uh the theft rings uh prostitution rings all these things are made
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:46.240]  illegal so they can get a cut off you understand um and and that's why the real mafia cities like
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:50.800]  chicago and new york they don't want the public being armed because they want to be able to up
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:56.480]  the level of crime and then get even more goods through their criminal uh workers but then also
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:00.800]  people then beg for more cops and there's more cops to boss you around like they are in new york
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:07.200]  i mean new york they just smoke cigarettes cigars lounge around uh and and just look at the public
[02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:12.560]  with absolute hate you are seen as the lowest bottom feeding trash and and the police just
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:17.360]  stand around with giant potbellies it's it's it's total victory over america total evil
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:22.480]  yeah it's it is kind of funny seeing some of these cops on on tv it's like how in a word did you
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:27.680]  pass the police exam you know well let me tell you something i've talked to austin cops who've been
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:33.040]  up in new york and asked for directions and they'll say do i look like a phone book get out of here
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:38.560]  they'll say oh you want something oh you do i'll split your head they'll do it right in front of
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.120]  families with kids now some of the cops in new york are friendly and nice but i'd say they're
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:49.520]  about 30% now and if you see all these videos it's the white shirt cops the political cops
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:54.560]  that are doing the beating and i mean they are just the ultimate criminal thugs with a badge in a

[02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:37.680]  here we'll also get into some other news but let's go to bill in connecticut bill welcome
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:45.520]  yeah hi alex um i i have four quick points i'll try to be brief on each one um i took my
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:52.320]  d90 camera down to zikati park about two weeks ago and my last question i wanted to interview
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:57.280]  people and see what their awareness was at the federal reserve but i snuck the question and it
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:03.920]  was my last question and i asked it in very general terms i i would say what are your thoughts on the
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:11.600]  federal reserve and three out of the five people that i interviewed were aware of it and they all
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.800]  indicated that they wanted they wanted to shut it shut it down and when you would look at these
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:21.760]  people you would think god they they were i didn't think they'd have any awareness at all but they
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:29.680]  truly did so that that sort of took me back a bit and by the way i uploaded uh you uh prison
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:36.080]  plan at that video um the other point is the gentleman saying he didn't think he didn't like
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:41.920]  you saying that there was nazis within the police department uh well back in and you know this back
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:49.840]  in 1945 truman allowed the cia to bring in uh what he thought at the time was a couple of hundred
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:59.200]  uh nazis but as it turned out it was closer to 20 000 that infiltrated not only the cia but our
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:07.120]  universities corporations uh infiltrate infiltration paperclip and my grandfather would tell me about
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:14.400]  this uh just in his work uh as a lease hound but he would be in and around military bases a lot of
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:21.440]  times in new mexico or arizona or west texas there's nowhere to eat or get gas but at military bases
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:25.920]  so he would say yeah there's all these german officers there you know he he would tell me
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:31.440]  those stories before he died now but yeah uh you're right tens of thousands of them to run
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:38.560]  nasa to run the cia claus barbie all of it and then they would have these made for tv you know
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:44.720]  things about nazi hunters and tracking this guy or tracking that guy or burning somebody who couldn't
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:50.000]  be proven to be a nazi and it's because the nazis had stolen what would be trillions today
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:56.400]  in art and gold and and diamonds and money and so they paid off the west and they basically came in
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:03.280]  out of the cold with the os s and then cia but i couldn't even exactly understand what that caller
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.360]  was saying an hour ago uh when he was asking about cops being nazis and saying i bet you
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:15.200]  don't want to come to jersey i bet it's nice there in texas and i and i wasn't even calling cops
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:22.720]  nazis i was saying america is the government policies no one can deny more and more resemble
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:28.800]  an authoritarian state uh and instead of just calling it north korea sometimes i say it's
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:34.720]  nazi-like or it's soviet-like and people send me emails saying now communism and fascism are two
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.400]  different things no they're not i know they're different in the textbook but they're all authoritarian
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:45.520]  in my book it's different flavors of the same you know you could paint a ball peen hammer green or
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:50.000]  black still if somebody beats you in the head whether it's it has the same effect uh so did
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.160]  you get from what he was saying that i was bad uh because i i i i couldn't understand it
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:05.440]  was that the cia is coming in and directing the police force and so my point to support your point
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:14.080]  is yeah and the cia uh there they had been infiltrated uh in the 40s and and i you would have to
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:19.680]  assume that that's still happening up until the present because i've never heard of any uh of
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:24.640]  anyone saying we've gotten rid of all the nazis out of our cia in other words they're still there
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:32.160]  um can you follow me on that point well i've actually studied this they're pretty much all dead
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:40.880]  but up until the 80s they were still using nazi officers to blow up aircraft in latin america
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:49.200]  to kill people for assassinations claus barbie set up and ran death squads uh the texas uh
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:56.080]  um lieutenant governor reportedly worked with him and and uh he's had that brought to his
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:03.840]  attention david dohurst and he won't talk about it but the point is the people running our government
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:11.360]  liked nazis i i don't even see it as nazis took over america eugenics and those ideas
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:18.720]  were started in england popularized in the us and the rockefellers openly funded hitler
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:23.440]  and the keiser velhelm institute this is all mainline you know mainline history it's not debatable
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:29.920]  and then bill gates his dad was involved in all of it uh and then so bill gates was chosen to
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.400]  then be this new front company to then promise that he'd donate the money just as ibm and given
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:39.280]  almost all its money to eugenics thomas watson and the hall earth machines would cover it an end
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:45.280]  game blueprint for global enslavement and so isn't the nazis took over they were coming home uh they
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:50.080]  were coming home to a place that loved them and cared about them uh it's just that the globalists
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:55.120]  had decided you know the king of england had to step down because he'd been too big of a nazi
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:01.520]  the decision was made to not let the nazis actually link up with the us they tried to hire smithley
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:07.360]  butler he blew the whistle on it so there were different factions but there was a fascist nazi
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:14.880]  faction uh in the u of s you see my point yeah but but i would think that there would at least be a
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:23.840]  thread there uh you know and even going back to um you know prescott bush and his uh uh i don't
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:29.520]  know what how much involvement is true or not true but no he was the head nazi agent and brown
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:35.520]  brother harrowman and with the different shipping lines they had construction lines and everything
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:41.280]  and he was the main nazi agent in the united states and uh he got away with it all because
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:47.200]  he set up uh the what's that thing where they get the the uh having one of those moments what's the
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:51.760]  thing of the us oh what's the thing where they send the hollywood folks and the people you know bob
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:15:00.720]  hope to do the the musical acts and things for the trips us oh yeah yeah us oh the point is
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:05.920]  prescott set that up as a political cover as world war two was starting because it was being
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:09.440]  discussed that he was a nazi and they were having hearings about it and they said look
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:14.960]  he runs the thing for the troops there's no way uh i mean this is even the london guardian now
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:19.680]  you know years after we reported it they quote broke it kind of like the fox news is breaking
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:25.600]  that bush had similar programs i guess it's okay obama did this uh because it you know it's a long
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:31.920]  term program but no i i think it's more than a string going back it's a giant cable uh going
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:38.400]  back and i totally agree with you and one last point alex because i know you know you had a
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:44.240]  call or a couple of weeks ago he said yeah alex i don't like you using sarcasm and i i thought
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:50.000]  you know how ridiculous number one you're very good at it and number two if we allow the globalist
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:58.320]  to take away our humor and uh most importantly a piece of mind then we've lost everything and i
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:05.760]  thought in particular uh when you were doing imitations of bill gates and al gore it was it
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:12.240]  was like dead on it was unbelievable and i guess my last point i did a humor part i thought it would
[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:18.240]  be great if you could have lionel back on again because the two of you seemed to to banter very
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:24.160]  well back and forth and he was hey that's a good idea let's call lionel jaren and get him on for
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:29.680]  an hour next week maybe third hour tuesday wednesday or thursday uh with his best material he's a
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:35.280]  he's a great syndicated radio host in his own right and just an amazing comedian we'll definitely
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.120]  get lionel back on next week if he can do it good to hear from you my friend thank you for the call

[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:57.760]  then we'll get to christian otter and kobe before i get our guest on but i've got to hit the new
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.400]  fast and furious and a couple other news items we haven't covered yet here uh let's go ahead and
[02:17:02.400 --> 02:17:10.480]  talk to robert in texas listening to 16 30 a.m uh what city are you in robert dollas okay good
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:18.320]  to have you on board with us what's on your mind today sir okay uh a week ago i was down there when
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:28.240]  you came to the tidal reserve bank in dollas i was approached by an fb r provocateur and i wanted to
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:33.680]  explain this to people and i'm for it i'm afraid they've called me on my cell phone
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:43.360]  and it's scaring me to death this man had a a tannister approximately six inches tall
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  and probably three to four inches in diameter and said you know that so you know he would give this
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:18:02.320]  tannister to me and i could throw it at the bank and it would explode and this is scaring me to death
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:09.280]  well this happens everywhere look look look it was probably probably uh well they do have fbi
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:13.600]  but they're using the army for this but the army was on our side three years ago and leaked that
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:18.320]  this happened so i'm going to skip this break right now because this is so important uh with you sir
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:22.560]  and i wish that you would have come to me while i was there perhaps you came when the demonstration
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:27.600]  was going on uh for a few days after i left there in dollas against the private federal reserve but
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:34.880]  this is standard i see it on my message boards i see it on youtube hey contact me i'm in miami
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:38.880]  i just got out of the army i want to overthrow the u.s government you go look at their dummy
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:43.440]  channel it's always the same so a lot of times they're just trying to find somebody who's mentally
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:49.360]  unstable uh who they can then set up and say that they threw the canister and that now you're saying
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:54.880]  they're calling you on your cell phone and yes when i say it's dangerous to go against the
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:19:00.240]  federal reserve these are the terrorists these are the people that run america this is this is the
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:05.600]  globalist this is the hijackers so so tell me when were you there exactly what happened and then get
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:14.080]  into the cell phone part friday when you were there a week ago friday when you were i came down to
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:24.960]  see you i'm i'm a big fan of excuse me of yours and i came down to listen to you speak and i was
[02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:32.080]  walking down the sidewalk and this man approached me he was about roughly my side i had to get in
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:39.280]  his face to get him away from me i mean this this man i'm 64 years old and you know he was
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:45.280]  basically threatening me take this take this throw this at the federal reserve bank i said i'm not
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:53.680]  taking anything i said i know what you are i said you're an fbi provocateur oh i wish you would
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:20:01.280]  have come and gotten me out of god was i there yes you had just got there well i oh they wanted
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:08.000]  to probably blame me for it and so there's 300 400 400 people there it's a big madhouse this guy's
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:17.280]  saying take this canister what did he look like five foot seven five foot eight brown hair uh probably
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:26.720]  in his early 40s uh he wore warframe glasses and he was saying take this take this please continue
[02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:33.120]  yeah okay he told me he says you have a cell phone don't you i said yes i have a cell phone
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:38.960]  he said i'll give you a number once you throw it over there by the federal reserve bank he says
[02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:48.640]  you can punch the number in and it will explode now that was a total cop and if you and if he
[02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:53.440]  could have intimidated you to take that they had it on the news they picked you out profiled you
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:21:00.320]  but i guess that you were a terrorist uh let me guess are you a veteran you're older white i mean
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:06.400]  that's the mo they want to put out now uh are you a veteran i know i'm not but i'm i'm an older
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:13.040]  person i'm 64 years old and i'm white man i wish you'd come over and got me i would have
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:18.400]  citizens arrested that guy i would have pounced on him and made the cops come over immediately
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:22.640]  the minute i would police police i'm not saying you did wrong you don't know what you know you
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:26.240]  never think this is going to happen to you you know my my thing is i've been sitting there
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:32.160]  signing dvds at a movie you know theater where i would go give speech and during the movie i'd
[02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:36.640]  be out there signing dvds and it's always the same cop walks up hey let's attack the police
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:41.600]  department and blow it up and i'll go you're a cop get out of here and i'd get the security and
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:47.360]  follow him out to be an unmarked police car or i'd try to build a veteran a memorial house uh
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:52.000]  you know his wife died or whatever and and they were trying to you know take his property and
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:57.920]  the police would come and try that and it's just always the same it never ends with these people
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:03.920]  and uh this is how they set folks up across the country and it's it's just so disgusting that they
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:09.120]  do it and they usually find mentally ill people they can set up but okay so he comes up he says
[02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:16.960]  i'll give you the cell phone continue okay he said he asked me he says do you have a cell phone i
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:24.000]  said yes i do and he said well all is i have to do you have to throw this over there against the
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:30.240]  building and he said i will give you a number to punch in on your cell phone and they said it
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:35.520]  will explode when you punch in the number yeah you would have thrown the dummy thing over there
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:40.320]  and then it could show the belief and then the intent by you triggering it that would be a record
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:49.040]  of a total a total fbi or adl or army and just wicked criminal so how did this end
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:58.480]  well i had to get in this this man's face because this man basically was almost forcing me to do
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:04.720]  this he he says you're an old man and i'll kill you and all this kind of stuff and i said wait a
[02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:11.280]  minute i said we're gonna have a war right here on the sidewalk if you don't get out of my face
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:18.480]  and you know no he picks you to try to intimidate you just like the mexican cartels do down here
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:22.960]  man i man i tell you these feds are criminal a man they're criminal you know a lot of times they'll
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.360]  get somebody and say we're gonna kill your whole family if you don't drive these explosives in
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:32.240]  like mcvey and he even told his gel mates that uh that's what they do to army officers how they
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:37.760]  set him up wow i wish you'd have got me man i would have i would have i would have held that
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:43.680]  person down and i'd have got the police over there unbelievable so so uh please continue
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:54.560]  okay they have called me two to three times on my cell phone they have my number so you know i know
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:24:01.200]  that you know that they monitor our phone calls i know they're monitoring this phone call that i'm
[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:07.040]  making to you i'm scared to death they don't be scared these are criminals they might even be foreign
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:12.080]  nationals they're listen sir they're doing this because they're weak they're doing this because
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:16.880]  we're identifying the private federal reserve that set all this up okay these are terrorists
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:23.440]  they haven't killed me yet okay because number one i pray to god and i have protection because of
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:28.480]  that and people pray for me because we know god's real but also because they don't want to turn me
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:34.560]  into a martyr they wanted to intimidate you into throwing that over there and then detonating it
[02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:38.560]  or it might have just been a fake bomb to stay on the news you know that you were a terrorist or
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:43.360]  whatever so they could demonize me and i had a weird feeling going to that dallas one but i just
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:47.200]  said i'm doing it that there'd be a provocative action in fact i don't want to get into it but i
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:51.360]  had my mind's eye something like that might happen in dallas specifically but i even think i even
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:56.160]  told you richard uh that they might pull something like that off that standard procedure in the 60s
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:25:03.040]  for these guys but by the grace of god he was unable to get you or others to do it also they
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:08.560]  can do this to people just to get stories going so people are scared the answer is protest the fed
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:13.120]  more i mean you know they're trying to shut down our youtube channel right now the answer is don't
[02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:18.880]  back down so you didn't give them your number but they're calling you i did not give them my
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:23.760]  number but they know my telephone number they knew who i was they called me by name
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:31.840]  i said robert and this man it's come in robert have you been involved in in uh in your past what

[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:04.880]  that's what's gonna happen people say you you're not in fear you don't have bodyguards no i mean
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:09.200]  it's like obi-wan kanobi strike me down i'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine

[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:32.400]  going to pose just a few simple questions for him in order and try to get his analysis on it
[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:39.200]  but Robert has called in he's saying he has witnesses and I wanted to finish up on the
[02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:46.480]  story of right as I arrive at the fellow reserve to about 400 people not this Friday but the Friday
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:53.200]  before last to protest the private fellow reserve 45 year old white male brown hair wire glasses
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:58.880]  was saying throw this canister at the building use this cell phone to detonate it or I'm going to
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:07.760]  beat you up sounds like a classic just crazy provocateur action and then now they're calling
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:12.800]  his cell phone threatening him so sir you get with your other witnesses your friends you go into
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:16.960]  the Dallas police department with your witnesses you said we want to see the surveillance tape
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:20.880]  we want you to go after this guy and you know at the time we were all shocked by it and now
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:26.800]  they're calling me and you get them to get the phone records they can actually unclope those
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.880]  numbers and of course it'll probably end up saying they don't want to investigate it because it's the
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:40.080]  FBI doing it or some other miscreant organization but again why didn't you come up to me when this
[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:46.640]  happened to you Robert Alex I tried to get to you and there's so many people around you that I
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:52.800]  could not get to you and I wanted to tell you straight out what had just happened to me and
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:59.440]  it was the guy's story off after you told him you were going to stomp him yeah he did well see
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:03.520]  the reason I believe this story is just the tone of your voice the whole history of it and I got
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:08.800]  a daughter pochinic here so I won't get off into it but I wanted to simply cover a FEMA drill and
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:16.800]  I had an army source saying that it was a drill to basically take over a uh you know key interstate
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:22.640]  highway route system it was a martial law continuity government drill so I get to Brooksville
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:27.920]  this is my film police state do the takeover year 2000 and I'm just friendly and a guy who'd been
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:31.920]  out we were building a memorial church for the branch of idioms who I thought was a cop and
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:35.840]  who acted real weird was always trying to stir stuff up look like a military type you know really
[02:35:35.840 --> 02:35:42.080]  good shape but uh look like special forces type and uh was always trying to stir stuff up this guy
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:46.240]  in the middle of nowhere shows up when we're there talking to locals the locals it's all on
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:51.680]  video say yeah the army's come to our door in Brooksville some video in the film is told us not
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:56.480]  to talk to you so then I'm sitting there outside the local airfield at night trying to film it
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.800]  and this guy steps out of the bushes and starts lighting things on fire and I went what are you
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:04.560]  doing putting it out and he's going come on let's burn everything down and I had to tell him and
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:08.240]  grab him and I said listen I know you think you're tough and I'm about to really hurt you bad
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:13.120]  and then he scurried off and later found out he was with the army but I mean the US army because
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:18.880]  I wanted to videotape him was ready to burn down Brooksville and put me in prison for it I mean
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:24.800]  I again this country is so far gone ladies and gentlemen I cannot describe to you and I know
[02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:29.120]  there's good people in the military as well you know like Anthony Schaefer exposing this is a fraud
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:33.280]  and the head of the bin Laden unit coming out with the Iran situation saying it's a fraud and
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.760]  and and all these countless people in the in the head of the bush administrations you know unit
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:42.640]  studying the purge and it's come out she said it was a fraud and uh you've got uh all these other
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:46.320]  people coming out you know fraud fraud fraud I'm going to get your number Robert I'm going to call
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:50.240]  you you need to go to the Dallas police department you need to get footage of this and you need to

[02:36:54.400 --> 02:36:58.480]  tell him you're locked and loaded and love it because again you give into their intimidation
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:02.880]  they love it just decide you're dead already enjoy it this is what living is all about you
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:07.520]  notice I'm out there no bodyguards I don't care you know what I'm not living in fear I don't care
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:11.360]  I'm not a cowardly piece of trash like them and that's the end of it we're going to restore
[02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:15.920]  the republic we're going to abolish the federal reserve it's over it's on nothing can stop us
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:21.280]  what did Thomas Jefferson said what waters the tree of liberty I'm miracle grow to this thing
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:25.280]  I'm bigger miracle grow they don't kill me but I don't care I'm not going to live as a coward I'm
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:30.640]  all in committed that's the way it is you can't stop it all right I know I'm ranting now uh
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:35.680]  Dr. Steve Pachinnick of course wrote the manual on psychological warfare for the state department
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:40.240]  ran CIA operations and well other operations all over the world and he's given us a lot of key
[02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:44.160]  information over the years it's turned out to be very accurate he called right when all this was
[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:49.120]  breaking before all the analysts had started to go public or right as they were to say the whole
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:54.160]  I ran thing was fake it's basically admitted to be fake now and I want to see about the green
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:59.760]  lighting and the rest of it but but what do you make of the last caller doc just briefly at the
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:04.320]  fellow reserve rally with somebody saying I you know throw this canister and activate it with a
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:09.040]  cell phone and the guy said no and he threatened to physically assault him what does that sound
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:15.680]  like to you well let me let me just tell you the personal experience where you have been and you
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:22.560]  and your show has been very effective I I just went to the Miami rally this weekend and and they
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:29.360]  were very peaceful and a lot of people were yelling uh person to alex jones info war turn into it
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:36.160]  and so I just want to congratulate you and the rest of you crew for being very uh influential
[02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:41.680]  in in the peaceful demonstrations now of course in every demonstration you're going to expect some
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:48.720]  as you'll probably get to or you may get expanded express express accept some uh infiltration but
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:54.320]  most of the time if this man has a problem he feels there was a provocative agent he should go
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:39:00.720]  to the Dallas police and find out but for the most part I think you alex really should address
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:05.280]  yourself to the students all over the country in the world they're quite quite frankly they're
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:11.280]  listening to even in Rome uh they were tuning in to you and in for when I was there uh before the
[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:16.800]  demonstration it's not because you agitated them but because you set up principles of freedom and
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:22.480]  against the principles of corruption that you and I stand for and the one thing this administration
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:27.200]  and many administrations are afraid of but particularly this one uh david axelrod came out
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:34.640]  again and in a very stupid I mean almost self denigrating way I mean denigrates the president
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:39.840]  reaffirms the fact that if you want to uh uh find how strong the president is
[02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:46.400]  just ask Osama bin Laden now that's so cynical and so idiotic but this is what you would expect
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:52.480]  from someone who works in the white house who's paid to be a liar who's paid to be a spinner
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:58.400]  and is telling the american public you want to vote for somebody who's already proven to be a liar
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:04.240]  and associate path and ineffectual but you've got to ask a dead man who's already been dead before
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:11.040]  he was shot so my point is uh there's a lot more to do in these demonstrations where you alex are
[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:16.880]  very influential in explaining to these young kids they have to pursue the issue of the corrupt banks
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:22.960]  the banks are absolutely corrupt nothing now one individual was really indicted for blank
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:29.840]  fine not blank fine engulfment sacks who's totally corrupt the entire institution was corrupt you
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:36.480]  have to just read the federal commission report jp morgan chase and uh a city bank i mean you've
[02:40:36.480 --> 02:40:41.760]  got a man uh rupin who was the former secretary of treasury under clinton receives 120 million
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:46.640]  dollars for being a counselor and monitoring the bank and then he was asked weren't you aware of
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:52.720]  the subprime fraud he said no i wasn't involved in that so the the level of corruption in the
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:58.240]  wealth that's egregious while the poor americans are working every day taking two to three jobs
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:05.200]  it is it's it's it's just not acceptable and the discrepancy between those who are working
[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:10.800]  this is not a class warfare this is really what democracy is about and and i'm proud of you alex
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:16.400]  and that's why i join your show from time to time to say that very rarely do we hear that kind of
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:22.240]  statement from somebody like yourself and the show as opposed to what we hear on the mainstream
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:29.840]  which uh identifies these students as dead beats or uh hippies or you know mount mountry
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:37.440]  is a miscontent which is not true to them and these are people from all walks of life who really
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:43.040]  have seen and understood that discrepancies between what the government says and does between a
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:49.040]  military that goes to war for reasons they don't even understand and play frankly i work with our
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:54.640]  military they've lost the war not because they don't know what the war was about but basically
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:42:00.720]  they implemented a war without an end without a strategy without any tactics and counter insurgency
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:06.880]  and counter does not mean anything in a world where you really can't identify the outcome of the end
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:13.200]  game or you're dealing in a corrupt society like carzai and afghanistan by the way the only thing
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:20.000]  that did come out with the war in afghanistan was increased crop of uh heroin and drugs they did
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:26.640]  very well this year thank you uh the u.s government exceeded their capabilities and instigating a huge
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:34.240]  crop of opium that was exceeded the year before in iraq we've totally destroyed the country but
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:39.760]  we have a one billion dollar embassy that's being protected by hundreds of millions of dollars worth
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:46.800]  of private mercenaries so basically what we have here is we have a government that's non-functional
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:51.760]  a legislature that is not only dysfunctional but really not irrelevant to the workings of
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:57.680]  democracy anymore when you can appoint 12 people to just take over from the legislation
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:03.520]  five hundred and sixty people which really doesn't belong it's arcane then we really have to rewrite
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:09.200]  the constitution rewrite the way we do government and we can no longer have just two parties we do
[02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:14.960]  have to have a third party and i see your influence is very important whether we agree on all matters
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:21.360]  or not that's the process of democracy and the protest is democracy and any legislator who thinks
[02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:29.600]  that this is anti-democratic and an anarchistic movement is so wrong and will be losing his
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:36.800]  or her job eventually that it's pathetic because america is moving and in thanks park to you over
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:43.120]  these 10 years people have been listening to what was called the uh so-called a conspiracy
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:49.200]  uh unit you hi e you and me and others and the truth of the matter is the real conspiracy is
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:54.160]  not committed by you or me it's just we read out exactly what the government has done and
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:44:00.560]  unfortunately these this government the government before it have been liars deceitful betrayed and
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:05.920]  the american public is not stupid i remember under jimmy carter one of the truck drivers
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:11.280]  once said you know what do they think we are drip dumb rummies we're not we're very smart people
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:16.960]  we know what we want we want jobs and we want the ability to just state what we want to state
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:24.240]  without being told what to do but we don't want a king or a queen in the form of obama a bush jr
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:30.000]  or their wives or the red news we don't want to pay millions of dollars for obama to run around
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.200]  and claim that he's doing job opportunities when in fact he's running for the presidency
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:39.120]  and we don't want candidates who are not qualified for the presidency and i'm really
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:44.080]  questioning whether we need a presidency or we just need a committee of governors that can run
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.520]  this united states of america with technicians the way we have it in singapore and get rid of a
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:55.920]  lot of that bureaucracy we don't need all the departments are there we don't need 876 000 top
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:03.200]  secret uh uh uh candidates in the intelligence community believe me the intelligence community
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:09.840]  is not that good for the most part you could get rid of probably 70 to 80 percent of them right now
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:14.800]  because of the effectiveness of social media and some of the outstanding candidates we have in
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:20.080]  cyber terms and cyber security but we don't need all these new organizations i don't think anybody
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:25.680]  knows what's going on certainly not the national not the director of national intelligence estimates
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:32.320]  i mean that was absurd what happened now we have uh soldiers going to jad in central africa did you
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:38.160]  know that alex oh yes well listen that's my questions for you and again we already have a shadow
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:44.720]  government we already have the bureaucracy with the shadow governors and the puppet uh uh
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.120]  presidents in there and an establishment that doesn't care about the future they only care
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:55.280]  about raw power but i specifically wanted to ask you uh because i mean i had so many other
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:46:00.000]  guests on last week they concurred that the green light was basically going on but now
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:07.120]  it's going back off at least partially because that whole fracas blew up in obama's face the whole
[02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:12.800]  fake iranian thing but now they're saying don't worry they've got more fake plots so i want to get
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:19.280]  into uganda i want to get into chat i want to get into obama's little african safaris he's got going
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:26.800]  on but first uh what's what does this signify that they put out this fake report it blew up in
[02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:34.800]  their face and does that mean that the iran attack is off well it means that they're number one uh
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.880]  they're attempt to try an iran attack or even on israel what's interesting is when we mentioned
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:46.720]  i mentioned to you that shin bet created a hamas and my intelligence reports showed me four days
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:53.840]  ago that shin bet went out of their way to talk to hamas about release of prisoners so you do
[02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:59.200]  have an effect what it does mean is that despite everything we're saying here and despite the
[02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:04.080]  american protest and by the way i haven't heard any legislators come forth if you alex i don't
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:10.800]  know if anybody in the audience has heard either democrat or republican or reprobate uh i denounced
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:15.920]  what the president did if the administration did because i think it's too cowardly i think
[02:47:15.920 --> 02:47:20.320]  well we have a really a bunch of cowards so number one what you've seen is the underlying
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:27.200]  underpinning problems of our of our our constitution really our society number one we have legislators
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:33.120]  who are pretty much crony capitalists two they're very weak and ineffectual three they really are
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:38.960]  ineffective we don't need them four you have a president who's ineffective number five he doesn't
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:44.720]  really care what the public says six you have an intelligence committee and a military that right
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:50.400]  now that's totally disconnected from the american public i think the intelligence organization is
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:55.760]  growing out of control because there's no one to oversee them and the committees that do oversee
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:01.200]  them are afraid of the military because they're distributed in such a way as you know in texas
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:07.280]  and alabama and georgia where they had control the contracts for the military industrial complex so
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:12.960]  in effect they hold many of the congressman senators hostage to the military industrial complex
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:18.640]  and then you have a lot of cronyism and professionalism in our military where you have self aggrandizing
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:24.160]  generals and and colonels leaving the military and then joining the private sector so now you
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:30.240]  have a total disconnect we have an imperial america that's tax americana but we don't have the republic
[02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:36.480]  and the republic is falling apart which is reminiscent to me and to your audience of the time of
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:45.200]  rome spain and france where we had large armadas but very ineffectual uh uh a force projection
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:51.200]  and really not relevant to where we are right now now we have to concentrate on the fact that
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.560]  the presidency itself is a questionable office i've got to be very frank i'm tired of having to
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:03.200]  rationalize the uh miscreant behaviors of the clinton or the ineffectual behaviors of the lives
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:08.960]  of a bush junior or the total dysfunctional behavior of an obama and what that tells me is
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:14.240]  not that i'm right or wrong it's just that this presidency in particularly really doesn't work
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.960]  it's a necronistic what happens is you have cronyism all around that you have an incredible
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:24.000]  amount of money that's spent on protecting someone who really is not relevant to our well
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:30.400]  being on an everyday basis what's the alternative now that we have social media we can reconstruct
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:35.600]  the structure of our society according to the needs of what we have and devolution of the federal
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:41.440]  power that's where i do agree with the ron paul's and others to say we don't need these institutions
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:46.720]  we don't need a military in afghanistan we don't need military in iraq and now we do not need a
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:52.480]  military in africa because there's no reason to be in uganda it's as if the military is restless
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:56.800]  like a bunch of school boys even our special forces and they have to run around the world
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:01.120]  telling you about extreme violence well that just doesn't happen we have to call them back
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  we have to reduce the size of our military reduce our size of our intelligence community reduce the
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:12.960]  size of our uh okay if we don't where's america going where's it going in 30 seconds because

[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:18.480]  interesting individual i've got to get him on someday just talk about himself and all the
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:23.840]  interesting things he's done definitely a spy master i guess you could call him uh and very
[02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:27.840]  interesting points he's been making here today i want to go to all these callers that are
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:34.800]  holding as well but i promise to read this uh Corinthians uh 13 1 13 and i'll do that in
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:40.640]  overdrive for five minutes but uh doc in the last five minutes we've got here the centrally getting
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:48.240]  back to uh the out of control behavior of this roman republican decline the you know the same old
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:53.520]  mania is the same old corruptions the same old looting some long-term planning a lot of short
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:55:00.320]  term uh stuff going on a lot of backstabbing uh i'm down here by the texas border it's in the
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:05.520]  front page the local paper that the kids uh say pledge of allegiance to the mexican flag in the
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:11.520]  public schools in mcallin i mean you cannot make up just how crazy this country's gotten
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:18.160]  and the fact that it is collapsing uh so how does how does i ran play into that i mean is the green
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:23.280]  line on that hit uh is that's i mean how big of a deal is it that that i mean i was trying to ask
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:29.840]  this earlier that that whole hoax blew up well it's a very big deal because they didn't expect
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:35.840]  this administration to have as many people uh really come forth from so many different sectors
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:41.920]  of the media and the analyst and the intelligence community saying you know it's enough it's stupid
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:48.800]  uh the osama bin laden story didn't work uh this certainly doesn't work it clearly diverts
[02:55:48.800 --> 02:55:54.560]  attention from eric holder who lied before congress who's lying about the fast and furious guns in
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:56:01.360]  mexico it's diverting attention from euler and the mystery and behaviors of the fdi the atf and dea
[02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:06.320]  i don't know how much more the american public's going to have to push but the protesters are
[02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:13.920]  going to have to say enough is enough uh no more wars no more lies and uh it's just not acceptable
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:19.280]  for less than this we would have put people in prison and they would have been executed quite
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:25.600]  frankly uh in other times but right now there's no accountability uh right now this president is so
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:32.000]  ineffectual and so self-destructive that it's really unbelievable i don't care whether he wins
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:37.920]  or uh he win i mean i don't care if he loses clearly i hope he does but i don't see an alternative
[02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:43.280]  and i think we're headed on a very self-defeating path and i think we need a third party so the
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:48.240]  tanner on issue is a very important one and how many who's not the brightest of all leaders so
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:53.360]  though i worked against his own father and pulled out helped to pull out a lot of hostages what is
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:59.840]  saying very clearly look if you persist on this nonsensical story or even attempt to do anything
[02:56:59.840 --> 02:57:04.400]  that won't be militarily they'll try to put pressure in other ways in terms of getting
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:11.600]  the japanese out of the evaluation of the uh uh nuclear power issue and by the way i i'm not pro
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:17.840]  iranian i am pro persian and i'm pro the students who protest against kumania i'm indian but these
[02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:24.640]  are not stupid people and uh well they do need nuclear power they do need energy it is a huge
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:30.320]  country uh you can't talk about iran without talking about israel having a nuclear bomb
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:36.000]  in that discrepancy in that that lie that israel has never admitted to having nuclear weapons
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:42.160]  it's absurd in the middle east that's the quiet wink and the quiet secret that oh yeah everybody's
[02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:47.760]  allowed not to have a nuclear bomb but only israel has one and by the way pakistan which is a far
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:53.440]  more dangerous country because it's not stabilized as a nuclear bomb but you've never heard netanyahu
[02:57:53.440 --> 02:58:00.000]  or anyone robin or simon peres or these great intellectual leaders of israel complain about
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:06.160]  the pakistani bomb which is far more dangerous than any iranian bomb because now adno muhler
[02:58:06.160 --> 02:58:12.240]  in his brilliant and competency has not only alienated the pakistani public but also alienated
[02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:19.040]  the isi so what we have in effect here is i think you have health and i'm not trying to give you
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:24.640]  accolades you really have helped through this show to instigate a lot of people to think twice
[02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:29.120]  including the mainstream media and the operatives and the intelligence communities you know well
[02:58:29.120 --> 02:58:35.120]  they listen to us to say you know this is stupid this has gone way above well donk donk it is stupid
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:39.280]  we're out of time thank you so much we're all helping together by facing the truth

[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:57.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance
[02:58:57.920 --> 02:59:03.120]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:08.320]  underneath the americans at home i've turned the members influence on our president in congress
[02:59:08.320 --> 02:59:15.040]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:20.560]  to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:26.080]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:31.200]  tim geithner bernanke they're arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying

[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:39.600]  and eight and a half years eight and a half plus years of information prison planet dot tv
[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:45.920]  maybe i'll talk more about this thursday on the show because erin's sitting in tomorrow
[03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:51.600]  but i don't know when you're sitting around calmly thinking about the world and all the
[03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:56.320]  beautiful good things that are in it and all the blessings of that god provides us
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:01.920]  and then you realize how all of us kind of get decadent and don't appreciate our own lives
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:12.160]  but the final question it's all about love versus hate love versus fear a lot of people see my
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:16.080]  anger and all the things i talk about and i think i'm trying to scare people it's the opposite
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:21.760]  i'm trying to get people to move in action against evil because i don't think of you as cowards when
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:26.080]  i talk about scary things the scary thing is there whether you admit it's there or not why
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:30.880]  not admit it's there and then deal with it i'm trying to deal with it here but i was doing
[03:01:30.880 --> 03:01:36.080]  some bible study for homeschooling this morning with my children and we were going over one
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:45.920]  Corinthians 13 and it says if i speak in the tongues of men or angels but do not have love
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:56.000]  i am only a resounding gong or a clanging symbol if i have the gift of prophecy and
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:03.200]  can fathom all the mysteries and all knowledge and i and if i have a faith that can move mountains
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:14.160]  but do not have love i am nothing continuing if i give all i possess the poor and give my body
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:21.840]  to hardship that i may boast but do not have love i gain nothing love is patient love is kind
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:29.120]  it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it does not dishonor others it is not
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:35.040]  self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs that's important people
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:39.360]  keep all this negative stuff in their minds like with their loved ones and people you should keep
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:45.440]  that in your mind remember that evil is evil not just sit there and obsess over petty slights love
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:51.440]  does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth that's key it always protects always trust
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:03:00.800]  always hopes always perseveres love never fails but where there are prophecies they will cease
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:05.440]  where there are tongues they will be stilled where there is knowledge it will pass away
[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:17.280]  for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when completeness comes what is in part
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:23.280]  disappears when i was a child this is the key here when i was a child i talked like a child
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:30.400]  i thought like a child i reasoned like a child but when i became a man i put the ways of childhood
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:36.240]  behind me see so many people have not put that behind them they're their children it can the
[03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:43.200]  childlike minds continuing for now we see only a reflection in a mirror then we shall see face to
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:53.120]  face now i know in part then i shall know fully even as i am fully known and now these three remain
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:58.480]  faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love and that's from Corinthians
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:08.720]  love moment in forever love for your family love of the truth being honorable that lives forever
[03:04:08.720 --> 03:04:14.240]  that echoes out through eternity through the universe the universe bends towards love it
[03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:19.920]  bends towards justice and that's why i'm not afraid i'm not afraid of what we've got to go
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:26.240]  through i'm not afraid of what i face because it is a great honor to be alive today it is a great honor
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:34.800]  to watch hawks fighting repeat repeatedly while i've been here to to have a dolphin swim along
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:40.320]  the boat and actually turn its head and look at me and that's magic life is magic and creation is
