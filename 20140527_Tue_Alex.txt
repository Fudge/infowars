[03:14.400 --> 03:22.040]  that is but it certainly helped though you can hear it essential oils in it are
[03:22.040 --> 03:26.400]  vital normally of my throat is a little tired or whatever that just knocks it
[03:26.400 --> 03:30.140]  right out but it's bad enough where it's only got the 20 30 percent so I'll
[03:30.140 --> 03:33.440]  continue to use the I'm not trying to product place here we obviously found

[12:12.800 --> 12:16.320]  these headlines in a list of most important
[12:16.320 --> 12:20.000]  the least important i'm just just i've got to get to this i'm just at least
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  mentioning the stories this one has got to be a top story
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.520]  or one of the top stories because it illustrates everything we're talking
[12:27.520 --> 12:33.440]  about it's in the Daily Mail out of the uk bbc mold
[12:33.440 --> 12:41.200]  for ruling girl is an offensive word members of parliament lead growing out
[12:41.200 --> 12:46.640]  try a political correct censorship now let's stop right there
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.240]  when you hear that what have you been conditioned to say
[12:50.240 --> 12:56.000]  in your mind what are you thinking when i just read that
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.920]  headline that if you use the word girl you can be arrested
[13:02.560 --> 13:06.720]  oh it's worse than this headline says you're thinking that's stupid
[13:06.720 --> 13:10.720]  that's idiotic that doesn't make any sense
[13:10.720 --> 13:15.280]  you know the drug wars failed uh environmentalist wackos are nuts
[13:15.280 --> 13:18.560]  no they're not they rule
[13:19.520 --> 13:23.840]  the big drug companies like fiser and bear and others
[13:23.840 --> 13:27.920]  were always the main distributors of opium
[13:28.800 --> 13:33.040]  and when opium monopolies got broken they just made it illegal so they could
[13:33.040 --> 13:35.440]  control it
[13:35.680 --> 13:39.600]  you're saying what does that have to do with this the establishment aren't
[13:39.600 --> 13:42.720]  idiots they're not wackos it's not that they're
[13:42.720 --> 13:46.720]  weird they rule the culture
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.360]  and when people stop laughing
[13:51.360 --> 13:54.640]  at stuff like this
[13:55.600 --> 14:01.920]  we will have a chance to start turning this society worldwide around
[14:01.920 --> 14:07.920]  it is 1984 destruction of language teaching people that every word out
[14:07.920 --> 14:11.360]  there is bad and giving the adherence of the politically
[14:11.360 --> 14:14.640]  correct priesthood
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.880]  power to peck you on the top of the head politically
[14:20.880 --> 14:28.560]  or disappear you into their bureaucratic social worker system
[14:30.320 --> 14:34.080]  whenever they feel like it they are defining
[14:34.080 --> 14:39.280]  everything as a thought crime so we're going to be breaking that down
[14:39.280 --> 14:42.160]  today at the bottom of the hour that's a very important article i want to detail
[14:42.160 --> 14:46.800]  it more but
[14:46.800 --> 14:51.280]  this is how you reduce the language all over the nation they're saying no more
[14:51.280 --> 14:55.280]  halloween parties unless at colleges unless it's an
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.080]  authorized list of costumes and of course that list will get
[15:00.080 --> 15:02.800]  smaller and smaller you can't have a native american
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.040]  you can't have a geisha girl you can't have a goddess sombrero
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.880]  you can't have anything you can't have talk of parties
[15:12.880 --> 15:18.560]  or siestas or fiestas you can't have a fiesta party because someone might be
[15:18.560 --> 15:21.520]  offended and there's no free speech they're just
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.480]  teaching you there's no free speech just like i told the churches in the 1950s
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.880]  you still have your tax exemption under the first amendment go get a 501c3
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.960]  and you waive your rights and then become
[15:36.960 --> 15:43.520]  a government-run charity
[15:43.920 --> 15:48.480]  it is not rhetoric to say we have state-run churches in this country
[15:48.480 --> 15:51.520]  they officially are
[15:53.360 --> 15:59.520]  i just want that to sink in i mean i'm looking at the headline here
[15:59.520 --> 16:09.440]  where the new york times is reporting quote tech firms
[16:09.440 --> 16:15.840]  attack law allowing feds to read email without warrant
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.960]  notice how we go from six seven years ago that no one's reading anything without
[16:20.960 --> 16:23.520]  a warrant you're a crazy five-headed kook
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.160]  lunatic alex jones if you say that
[16:28.160 --> 16:33.440]  to oh the tech firms don't like the fact that all the emails go through the
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.280]  government servers first and they have giant snooping arms inside their
[16:37.280 --> 16:39.760]  systems
[16:40.880 --> 16:44.640]  and the tech firms have a strategy the big ones they're behind all this they're
[16:44.640 --> 16:49.360]  they're spying more than the nsa they are the nsa
[16:51.200 --> 16:54.480]  where they don't want to be sued so they're acting like they're against all
[16:54.480 --> 16:59.280]  this yahoo and google and facebook and apple
[16:59.280 --> 17:02.720]  meanwhile apple runs death camps basically in china
[17:02.720 --> 17:06.560]  with suicide nets forced abortions
[17:06.720 --> 17:09.920]  forced medical exam facilities and you see video of the people at their
[17:09.920 --> 17:14.640]  factories they literally look like zombies out of a horror movie
[17:14.640 --> 17:19.600]  they take them warehouse them for their organs dna test them
[17:19.600 --> 17:24.160]  like the movie coma from the 70s and take you to a mobile execution van kill
[17:24.160 --> 17:28.400]  you on the way to the airport to fly your organs into japan
[17:28.400 --> 17:31.760]  where every day people get off the planes from the west
[17:31.760 --> 17:35.600]  to get quote the freshest organs
[17:35.600 --> 17:40.160]  and chinese government promo brochure a few years ago we covered said
[17:40.160 --> 17:45.440]  in the chinese translation into english we have the freshest organs
[17:45.440 --> 17:48.880]  this is what apple will do to you and your family
[17:48.880 --> 17:52.480]  this is what all these trendy google operations all of it when they have
[17:52.480 --> 17:56.080]  control and they have an authoritarian regime to work with
[17:56.080 --> 18:02.960]  you are below the level of scum you are to be sucked up and used you are trash
[18:02.960 --> 18:08.240]  you are seen as trash by people that believe they're gods
[18:08.240 --> 18:14.880]  you take the words of elliot roger he said i'm a god i'm gonna kill you
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.160]  how many hundreds of times if i told you that's the elite's attitude
[18:18.160 --> 18:24.720]  he was a product of a rich wealthy elitist disconnected system
[18:24.720 --> 18:29.680]  and he was on psychotropic drugs that now is coming out since age eight
[18:29.680 --> 18:36.000]  he was a total product of being a modern demon
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.920]  now critics blame shooting on white male hollywood
[18:39.920 --> 18:44.400]  and feminist groups are coming out saying this is why we need gun control
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.560]  yes yes wouldn't it be pro woman to arm women
[18:48.560 --> 18:52.480]  and teach women how to fight conservatives and libertarians teach
[18:52.480 --> 18:56.640]  their daughters how to fight how to shoot gods by the way if you
[18:56.640 --> 19:01.680]  don't inhibit a woman being aggressive they're vicious
[19:02.960 --> 19:07.840]  my nine-year-old daughter was he's 10 now just turned 10
[19:07.840 --> 19:11.600]  can actually beat me up i mean i mean i could
[19:11.600 --> 19:14.720]  i could beat her in a fight obviously but what i mean is when she's wrestling
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.920]  or punching me it hurts she's strong i mean i have to when she's
[19:19.920 --> 19:24.880]  wrestling with me i have to really put strength into it to control her
[19:26.240 --> 19:31.280]  and she you know her and my 11-year-old son getting fights
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.200]  and wrestle and i mean and he's big
[19:35.280 --> 19:39.120]  and you know my dad's tickled my mother before and she knocked him out with a
[19:39.120 --> 19:43.680]  boot still toe boot even though it was an unconscious you know flinch doing it
[19:43.680 --> 19:47.600]  the whole point is that's feminism who empower women to be strong because
[19:47.600 --> 19:50.800]  they're just part of the tribe want the whole tribe to be strong
[19:50.800 --> 19:54.640]  modern feminism is about isolating women destroying women
[19:54.640 --> 19:58.240]  turning them into sexual objects and wives to the state
[19:58.240 --> 20:03.680]  the state is now your father so my elementary school age child is begging

[20:07.520 --> 20:11.280]  the research and it makes sense to me that any mobile device that operates

[24:32.320 --> 24:38.880]  here is the clip of Elliot Roger the reported shooter of four people
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.640]  including himself stabber of three others so six that he killed half
[24:42.640 --> 24:45.680]  died by knives we had several articles about that over the
[24:45.680 --> 24:50.160]  weekend at info wars.com but the controlled corporate press is
[24:50.160 --> 24:53.840]  basically saying it's all because of guns senator bloominthol's
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.200]  reintroduced bills to restrict the second amendment
[24:57.200 --> 25:01.920]  following the california shooting and then there's not a debate about
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.480]  how many psychotropic drugs was this guy on i mean i took one look at him and i
[25:06.480 --> 25:09.520]  said i guarantee you that guy has been in the psychiatric system
[25:09.520 --> 25:13.920]  for most his life well it's in the associated press now since age eight
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.520]  and they are saying that he was being treated or quote asked burgers with
[25:17.520 --> 25:21.440]  medication we don't know what type well we should do the investigation then
[25:21.440 --> 25:27.840]  have the headline what drugs was Santa Barbara shooter on
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.440]  illness not misogyny made Elliot rogers kill
[25:33.440 --> 25:37.680]  yeah no kidding and you're never going to stop crazy
[25:37.680 --> 25:40.960]  you have more guns and they'll have less chance to kill more people and that's
[25:40.960 --> 25:44.240]  been happening the total number of shootings is
[25:44.240 --> 25:49.840]  down 52 percent since 1992 justice department on numbers
[25:49.840 --> 25:53.680]  but see reality
[25:53.840 --> 25:59.120]  doesn't have a very good shot does it in an age of deception
[25:59.120 --> 26:02.400]  to have a bunch of people grandstand up there and say collectively gun owners
[26:02.400 --> 26:05.680]  are to blame well do you want to take the blame
[26:05.680 --> 26:08.000]  out there as a gun owner how about as a knife owner
[26:08.000 --> 26:11.440]  i bet even the people out there that don't like guns and don't own guns
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.320]  they are minority in this country about 45 percent i bet you've got knives
[26:16.320 --> 26:23.200]  and baseball bats and golf clubs and i bet you've got
[26:23.200 --> 26:28.560]  a stainless steel vase that you could club somebody's brains out with or a
[26:28.560 --> 26:31.840]  hammer you could kill people easier with a
[26:31.840 --> 26:34.960]  hammer than with a butcher knife in a lot of cases
[26:34.960 --> 26:38.560]  i want to ask you right now there are thousands of murders a year
[26:38.560 --> 26:45.680]  with baseball bats and hammers why have you not turned to men you are to blame
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.000]  this is madness not one more person can be allowed to die
[26:50.000 --> 26:57.040]  in this country by murder by homicide by the hands of another
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.560]  and people are using cars to kill people by the hundreds on purpose
[27:00.560 --> 27:04.640]  ban all cars they are using knives to kill people
[27:04.640 --> 27:09.680]  by the thousands ban them ban them now

[27:28.800 --> 27:32.800]  who are being manipulated in their pain are crying on television
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.760]  literally believing the propaganda that it's gun owners fault
[27:37.760 --> 27:41.280]  that's that the psychiatric system had this guy hopped up on stuff that the
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.280]  inserts says will will make you kill people
[27:45.280 --> 27:49.440]  and yes folks i'm saying he was on drugs they had many was being treated
[27:49.440 --> 27:52.240]  with medication but they won't say what because they
[27:52.240 --> 27:55.760]  don't want to blame because every time this happens it takes two weeks to a
[27:55.760 --> 27:58.880]  month and then it comes out with adam lanza
[27:58.880 --> 28:02.720]  and homes and kip kinkle and harris and clibald

[28:25.120 --> 28:30.880]  completely aggressive and walked around with my buddies
[28:30.880 --> 28:34.800]  i was like a teenager for miles every day
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.560]  and then day two would vomit everywhere and feel horrible for two days after
[28:38.560 --> 28:41.760]  i'm like how would anyone take this and i've talked to people that are on
[28:41.760 --> 28:46.400]  adderall and riddling they say it's similar i mean they're putting kids on

[33:19.440 --> 33:25.920]  it's alex jones waging war on corruption crashing to the
[33:25.920 --> 33:30.480]  lies and disinformation monday through friday
[33:30.480 --> 33:36.800]  11 a.m central 2 p.m central nightly news seven o'clock
[33:36.800 --> 33:40.800]  weeknights and my voice is so shot people would
[33:40.800 --> 33:45.600]  kill for a voice that sounds like this and i would kill to not have my voice be
[33:45.600 --> 33:48.240]  like this it gets a little old when a waiter comes
[33:48.240 --> 33:50.560]  over and you sound like a cross between darth vader and
[33:50.560 --> 33:53.920]  clonieswood when you're ordering a drink or something
[33:53.920 --> 33:59.120]  i gotta go get my larynx looked at okay there is so much so much to go over
[33:59.120 --> 34:04.000]  here ladies and gentlemen elliot roger
[34:04.080 --> 34:09.520]  had a autism spectrum disorder and if you know folks that have
[34:09.520 --> 34:15.600]  asperger's it's real they're like robots they're highly intelligent
[34:15.600 --> 34:20.080]  but they are like robots at least part of their personality
[34:20.080 --> 34:25.680]  and when they shift into the robot phase it's it's like you're not even talking
[34:25.680 --> 34:31.760]  to a person and a lot of the shooters are
[34:31.760 --> 34:36.160]  asperger's with shoot them up games which is now coming out the sky was a
[34:36.160 --> 34:39.200]  video gamehead we're trying to cover up which ones because it's a
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.640]  30 40 billion dollar year industry and growing just to shoot them up games
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.120]  getting bigger than hollywood itself by the way under psychiatric care since age
[34:47.120 --> 34:51.440]  8 quote being given treatment and again the treatment for
[34:51.440 --> 34:56.480]  asperger's is psychotropic's anti psychotics uh the same type of drugs
[34:56.480 --> 35:02.720]  that they give people for uh things like what they call bipolar see so
[35:02.720 --> 35:05.840]  much of the public is acting like schizophrenics now
[35:05.840 --> 35:09.520]  and and have personality disorders and borderline personality disorder
[35:09.520 --> 35:13.760]  which you can give them labels they're real but more and more the public is
[35:13.760 --> 35:18.000]  completely out of their mind and that's done because the brain has been
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.760]  rewired from birth sitting in front of the television that's on record
[35:21.760 --> 35:25.360]  the wireless pollution the chemicals the biologicals
[35:25.360 --> 35:29.280]  uh the gmo's that cause all sorts of mental illness
[35:29.280 --> 35:33.760]  and genetic mutations in the brain uh of lab animals
[35:33.760 --> 35:37.840]  this is all happening with us it's not just pediatric cancer is up 10 000
[35:37.840 --> 35:40.400]  percent
[35:40.400 --> 35:44.960]  it's not just diabetes up type two three thousand percent in the
[35:44.960 --> 35:48.320]  hispanics it's more than that they estimate by 2025
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.920]  half the us will have diabetes type one or two
[35:51.920 --> 35:56.080]  by 2025 that's only like 10 years away now 11 years away
[35:56.080 --> 36:01.520]  and that something like 75 percent or 80 percent of hispanics will have it
[36:01.520 --> 36:06.000]  and no one asked why is this happening to hispanics
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.000]  well if you're hispanic and have a lot of native blood
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.800]  indigenous blood those populations didn't eat sugar folks in high amounts
[36:14.800 --> 36:20.000]  processed sugar and they certainly didn't drink processed alcohol
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.200]  and that's why it's a genetic fact they would call me being discriminatory
[36:23.200 --> 36:28.240]  the state of fact that indians as they were known back when
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.080]  folks thought this was india 550 something years ago they
[36:32.080 --> 36:36.400]  discovered the quote new world that if you sold some whiskey to the
[36:36.400 --> 36:39.600]  indians a bunch of them would end up drinking themselves to death
[36:39.600 --> 36:43.840]  europeans thousands of years of saving the grain they produced
[36:43.840 --> 36:47.760]  as alcohol through the winter a completely alcoholic society
[36:47.760 --> 36:51.040]  and all the studies are there that europeans can drink more than anybody
[36:51.040 --> 36:54.160]  else they got livers that can handle it because
[36:54.160 --> 36:57.520]  everybody died who couldn't just like europeans can handle smallpox
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.840]  the smallpox has been in the old world for at least 10 000 years they can dig
[37:01.840 --> 37:04.800]  up the bodies and see it it was never here until
[37:04.800 --> 37:08.320]  christopher columbus showed up 500 plus years ago see this is but see i'm not
[37:08.320 --> 37:11.520]  supposed to even have a scientific discussion here a fact
[37:11.520 --> 37:15.280]  and tell hispanics how to not get their legs sought off
[37:15.280 --> 37:21.120]  i drive by the bus stops every day every day i like i want to report on this
[37:21.120 --> 37:25.120]  and boil their faces and i see the hispanics with their legs chopped off
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.920]  young and old it's a it's a it's a it's a genocide
[37:29.920 --> 37:34.880]  and i want to go warn them but southern private law center cnn would say i was
[37:34.880 --> 37:38.560]  racist if i warned them that hey you can't drink alcohol
[37:38.560 --> 37:48.400]  and you can't drink aspartame that's what alcohol it will kill you
[37:48.400 --> 37:52.480]  and you certainly can't eat processed foods it will hit you a lot harder
[37:52.480 --> 37:56.400]  europeans have had a much more horrible diet for a long time
[37:56.400 --> 37:59.760]  than pretty much anybody else
[38:00.640 --> 38:03.600]  europeans come from the ice age ladies and gentlemen
[38:03.600 --> 38:08.160]  and a totally different developmental cycle
[38:11.760 --> 38:18.880]  but the bbc says i can't even say the word girl or i will be arrested and
[38:18.880 --> 38:23.040]  people won't believe that guys type in bbc presenter arrested for using the
[38:23.040 --> 38:27.360]  word homosexual i had robin page on 10 years ago
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.160]  when this happened and they got so threatened by police when he came on he
[38:30.160 --> 38:36.000]  wouldn't come back on robin page was at a rural affairs meeting
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.600]  and he said we deserve the same rights as rural communities
[38:39.600 --> 38:43.440]  as homosexuals and muslims and he was arrested
[38:43.440 --> 38:47.280]  and basically lost his job one man and his dog he would walk from pub to pub
[38:47.280 --> 38:50.800]  drinking beer and talking about cool rural areas
[38:50.800 --> 38:56.640]  all over the britannic aisles well the reason i mentioned that and it's all
[38:56.640 --> 39:03.360]  going to tie together is that political correctness now
[39:06.320 --> 39:11.200]  means you don't communicate on anything you only repeat
[39:11.200 --> 39:16.960]  the provided message of the establishment
[39:18.240 --> 39:23.920]  you only say what they say and then you're politically safe
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.400]  and and you'll be secure in the fold with the niche you've been put in
[39:28.400 --> 39:32.160]  this is called cult programming
[39:32.960 --> 39:37.120]  and here is a great example today now remember two weeks ago they said that
[39:37.120 --> 39:40.880]  you can't have fiesta parties at universities nationwide it's if one
[39:40.880 --> 39:44.880]  person complains their band well somebody complained about the
[39:44.880 --> 39:48.160]  clan on campus they shouldn't be able to stop them
[39:48.160 --> 39:51.520]  because not that we like the clan but because we don't want to lose our rights
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.640]  correct a free expression as real liberals
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.520]  more freedom not less because it's hurtful if somebody has
[40:01.520 --> 40:07.040]  a fiesta party by the way i was invited a few weeks ago
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.680]  to a pool party at a big condo and guess what folks
[40:11.680 --> 40:15.600]  we happen to have a fiesta party with chicken and
[40:15.600 --> 40:20.160]  fajitas cooked on the grill and and people are drinking tequila margaritas
[40:20.160 --> 40:23.120]  do you know who was out there at the same pool party
[40:23.120 --> 40:27.680]  there were middle-class mexicans because a ton of those folks who moved up here
[40:27.680 --> 40:30.560]  because mexico's so dangerous they were all wearing little
[40:30.560 --> 40:33.520]  sombreros on their heads instead of a little party
[40:33.520 --> 40:36.480]  and they were having a fiesta party too because they were racist
[40:36.480 --> 40:40.880]  so you were basically at a clan rally i well i mean we have the same idea to
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.000]  eat fajitas and and people are having margaritas
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.040]  because we're racist it's not that we like the food or the or the
[40:47.040 --> 40:51.200]  you know that culture and but but but these mexicans
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.720]  as we ended up partying with them some they spoke pretty good english
[40:56.720 --> 40:59.520]  and these guys and their senior readers and we were all kind of had all of us
[40:59.520 --> 41:02.960]  kind of had a party and it was because it was because we were racist
[41:02.960 --> 41:06.160]  you know killing a million iraqis isn't racist in the iraq war
[41:06.160 --> 41:09.440]  putting cancer viruses and vaccines shooting black people up with syphilis
[41:09.440 --> 41:13.040]  that's not racist uh boarding 52 percent of blacks in this country before
[41:13.040 --> 41:16.400]  they're born that's not racist what's racist
[41:16.400 --> 41:21.200]  is well our sexist is if somebody on a bunch of drugs and psychiatric care
[41:21.200 --> 41:24.240]  whose mentally ill goes out and shoots people
[41:24.240 --> 41:27.360]  because he was obsessed with girls classic ashburgers be obsessed with
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.720]  something and then throw a fit if they can't control it
[41:32.720 --> 41:37.360]  it's our fault not just if you're white if if you're black hispanic asian
[41:37.360 --> 41:40.720]  john it's your fault so do you want to take blame right now for the killings
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.120]  in california john i i might as well uh i was at a pool party
[41:45.120 --> 41:48.160]  myself a couple of weeks ago and there's a guy with a sombrero on
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.520]  and the guy next to him said you better take that off
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.680]  really i didn't know that yeah yep it's rampant
[41:55.680 --> 41:59.600]  the conditioning is rampant
[41:59.840 --> 42:04.320]  well i want you to apologize right now because you're a male and you're white
[42:04.320 --> 42:07.280]  doubly do you want to apologize for the deaths in the
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.800]  california i just want to apologize for california
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.280]  for being so plastic but i mean think about the mind control this is done on
[42:17.280 --> 42:20.320]  purpose this isn't political correctness out of control
[42:20.320 --> 42:27.520]  here's the headline bbc mauled for ruling girl is offensive word
[42:27.520 --> 42:31.520]  member of parliament leads growing outcries political
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.160]  correct censorship expands bbc cut the g word
[42:36.160 --> 42:39.600]  from repeat of the commonwealth games documentary because the guy goes oh my
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.040]  gosh i got beat by a girl
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.960]  everything is offensive fiesta parties
[42:50.720 --> 42:57.520]  government-run uh colleges say you will not be a geisha girl you will not
[42:57.520 --> 43:00.560]  be a cowboy no stereotypes you will not be an indian
[43:00.560 --> 43:05.680]  you will be nothing see this is about them having the authority over
[43:05.680 --> 43:08.640]  everything and now in europe passing laws
[43:08.640 --> 43:12.800]  where you're arrested if you use the word girl
[43:12.800 --> 43:16.800]  or homosexual there's no law saying those are illegal words but they
[43:16.800 --> 43:22.480]  put spies in london restaurants and in sheffield restaurants it's in the news
[43:22.480 --> 43:26.480]  look it up spying to hear if someone says a word that's
[43:26.480 --> 43:30.720]  wrong and they arrest you this is just training you that you disappeared
[43:30.720 --> 43:35.920]  you want to put 20 percent of children under the age of 17 down to age two on
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.440]  antipsychotics psychotropic and speed that brain damages them that's fine
[43:41.440 --> 43:44.400]  you want to engage in every obscenity out there and
[43:44.400 --> 43:48.160]  have breast cancer exploding everywhere with glyphosates in the entire water
[43:48.160 --> 43:51.680]  supply that literally on record they admit grows the tumor
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.320]  there's no discussion of getting glyphosates out it's just fine to cure
[43:56.320 --> 43:59.760]  not why are our women all dying no no just cc because
[43:59.760 --> 44:04.560]  well you know we'll have a race we'll give some money to the cancer institutes
[44:04.560 --> 44:10.000]  and grips that are openly covering up the fact this is an engineered program
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.440]  and we'll all just go along with the social engineering and feel good about
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.760]  ourselves and and again they've said how dare anyone
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.920]  own guns they've had fathers come out repeating what the media is saying a
[44:25.920 --> 44:30.960]  talking point of how dare you gun owners you craven cowards
[44:30.960 --> 44:36.720]  you caused all the death you did it the nra and you gun owners when is this
[44:36.720 --> 44:39.760]  going to stop we cannot have one more person die
[44:39.760 --> 44:43.440]  close quote remember the father said that sunday
[44:43.440 --> 44:45.840]  and i feel sorry for him but you know what i didn't have anything to do with
[44:45.840 --> 44:48.800]  your son's death
[44:49.040 --> 44:53.040]  and my guns protect me and my family just like cars kill hundreds of thousands
[44:53.040 --> 44:57.040]  i mean we can't have one more death on the highways it's so terrible
[44:57.040 --> 45:00.880]  you craven car owners we must ban them now not one more
[45:00.880 --> 45:04.480]  automobile death on the highways
[45:04.880 --> 45:09.600]  i mean it's obscene to blame gun owners for this
[45:09.600 --> 45:13.680]  i'll tell you who it's not obscene to blame it says on the inserts of the
[45:13.680 --> 45:16.640]  psychotropic and the amphetamine drugs they're giving our kids
[45:16.640 --> 45:20.080]  that it can make you go totally insane have megalomania
[45:20.080 --> 45:24.560]  murder people you name it and it's the california sick plastic
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.000]  culture and the pharmacological psychiatric system
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.840]  that kills your son more than anything
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.280]  but at the end of the day he was killed by a plastic
[45:35.280 --> 45:38.480]  mentally ill monster
[45:39.840 --> 45:48.480]  mr martinis not by alex jones and again at a very core level i thought it
[45:48.480 --> 45:53.600]  very offensive that this meme is being put out
[45:53.600 --> 45:56.000]  everywhere
[45:57.760 --> 46:01.120]  that when something happens it's our fault and we've gotten to the point
[46:01.120 --> 46:04.160]  where you can't say the word girl and whatever happens in england ends up
[46:04.160 --> 46:06.720]  happening here and people say it's asinine to say you can't dress up like
[46:06.720 --> 46:10.400]  a cowboy at the party because that's against rural
[46:10.400 --> 46:13.280]  workers or it's asinine to say you can't dress up like a pirate
[46:13.280 --> 46:16.800]  or a geisha girl of course dressing up like a geisha girl isn't putting down
[46:16.800 --> 46:20.080]  japanese it's the fun of the party how are you going to dress
[46:20.080 --> 46:23.520]  everyone knows that instinctively so you say oh that's crazy no it's not
[46:23.520 --> 46:27.680]  crazy it's authoritarianism it's a cult takeover
[46:27.680 --> 46:30.960]  i want to play a clip of who killed the people
[46:30.960 --> 46:34.880]  the wind-up toy monster created by this sick
[46:34.880 --> 46:38.240]  unhealthy unnatural modern pharmacia
[46:38.240 --> 46:43.600]  society if you want to know where the blame lies
[46:43.600 --> 46:50.400]  it lies with the hollywood director parents and the system
[46:50.400 --> 46:54.320]  that gave them the fake moral authority to institutionalize their son
[46:54.320 --> 46:58.080]  from age eight so that he was completely screwed up
[46:58.080 --> 47:00.960]  and then the modern corrupt hollywood culture behind it of death
[47:00.960 --> 47:05.440]  and and and and people like bill mars saying i want more death more death more
[47:05.440 --> 47:09.360]  killings more suicide all these so-called liberals love death all
[47:09.360 --> 47:13.600]  they talk about is death because they're a bunch of spoiled sicko brats
[47:13.600 --> 47:16.800]  at the end of a decadent cycle before our society collapses
[47:16.800 --> 47:23.440]  let's play this clip well now i will be a god compared to you

[47:41.040 --> 47:45.280]  notice that he's a god because he's gonna have a gun
[47:45.280 --> 47:48.240]  and he's going to go into a victim disarmament zone in california
[47:48.240 --> 47:52.000]  with a bunch of trendies who would never have a gun and he's going to kill them
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.080]  because they're animals because they can't defend themselves
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.080]  he's a god with that gun well i'm not a god i'm just a man
[47:58.080 --> 48:01.600]  but i need guns to protect myself from out of control government out of
[48:01.600 --> 48:05.760]  control institutions now uh one of the tv
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.480]  end producers here in graphics guys um joe jennings
[48:10.480 --> 48:13.360]  who works here in the office does a great job last four or five months one of
[48:13.360 --> 48:16.480]  our new hires uh he heard me talking about
[48:16.480 --> 48:21.120]  what lou vox and ridlin and adderall you know
[48:21.120 --> 48:24.000]  both the prozac type drugs and the speeds due to kids
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.160]  and he was just describing during the earlier break what it did to him
[48:28.160 --> 48:31.680]  so i thought we'd let him give you some of his testimony since he was
[48:31.680 --> 48:35.520]  had the courage to come on air uh joe jennings fellow info warrior
[48:35.520 --> 48:39.520]  just briefly tell folks so your experience with these drugs well i was
[48:39.520 --> 48:44.160]  diagnosed with uh adhd at a young age in california
[48:44.160 --> 48:48.640]  uh and you know i was just a very vibrant
[48:48.640 --> 48:53.200]  child most mammals are most most juvenile mammals jump around and
[48:53.200 --> 48:55.760]  just yeah that's what i was loud as being a kid
[48:55.760 --> 49:02.880]  so uh they prescribed ridlin for me to help me focus in school and focus on my
[49:02.880 --> 49:05.520]  mental stability because it will burn you out after about a month
[49:05.520 --> 49:09.440]  yeah as soon as they put it on they put me on ridlin as soon as they put it on
[49:09.440 --> 49:13.760]  at the uh my teachers in class go call my parents up and go
[49:13.760 --> 49:19.200]  there's something wrong with your child now before he was vibrant and social and
[49:19.200 --> 49:24.320]  now he's like a zombie who doesn't do anything he just sits there in his own
[49:24.320 --> 49:27.520]  world and my parents wouldn't wait to search
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.200]  something wrong with this so that's because they were extremists
[49:31.200 --> 49:34.560]  yeah why didn't they trust the state i mean that's what obama and carrey
[49:34.560 --> 49:37.200]  they all just say keep the faith even use that term
[49:37.200 --> 49:42.000]  why don't you want to worship the state brother i i don't know maybe i'm just
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.720]  uh you want to say it's your fault the people died in california are you a
[49:44.720 --> 49:47.360]  gun owner you know i'm not a gun owner but you know
[49:47.360 --> 49:51.840]  it probably was my fault because i let people get put on these ridlin drugs and
[49:51.840 --> 49:54.640]  stuff like that you know i guess in a way we are all guilty for
[49:54.640 --> 49:57.680]  yeah we're we're okaying this we're okaying
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.600]  numbing our children and completely taking their identity
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.440]  so what happened did you get off of it uh no they prescribed me dexadrin to
[50:05.440 --> 50:09.680]  bring me back up so they put me on ridlin and then they put
[50:09.680 --> 50:15.520]  me on dexadrin as a combo to level me out how was that horrible
[50:15.520 --> 50:19.120]  you know i was i was still numb it's just i had energy now
[50:19.120 --> 50:24.240]  so uh after a while we just completely do you know what speed does of all types
[50:24.240 --> 50:29.520]  to fast growing brain cells no i don't it's not good you know they
[50:29.520 --> 50:33.440]  used to spray paint in the 60s and 70s speed kills

[54:18.000 --> 54:22.080]  this is a military operation a globalist mind control operation against the
[54:22.080 --> 54:25.200]  population they now admit that they say the cia
[54:25.200 --> 54:29.040]  domestically engages in psyops through the news against the american people
[54:29.040 --> 54:32.240]  they've been doing it since the 40s but now they legalize it this year
[54:32.240 --> 54:35.280]  it'd been illegal before they said oh it's legal now
[54:35.280 --> 54:39.680]  to lie to you and run psyops against you and the goal is to get the public on
[54:39.680 --> 54:43.440]  drugs illegal and legal and the big banks launder the money
[54:43.440 --> 54:46.480]  joe how did it all end when they put you on multiple
[54:46.480 --> 54:53.360]  drugs when you were a child well finally after you know years
[54:53.360 --> 54:57.120]  i just couldn't you know my parents couldn't justify doing this to their
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.320]  child they so they remembered that you were better before they put you into
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.080]  the soft kill grid yes and they and they said you know
[55:04.080 --> 55:06.960]  but you were all queued up be completely destroyed though
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.080]  oh yeah i mean i mean they'd have you at your age today on 15 drugs
[55:10.080 --> 55:13.760]  oh yeah they would have tried it all i mean zolofs they would have whatever
[55:13.760 --> 55:20.720]  just to alter my mood because i was too energetic i was too racist i maybe i
[55:20.720 --> 55:23.600]  thought crime yeah i i wanted i didn't i was
[55:23.600 --> 55:27.280]  questioned when i went to church i always questioned oh just please don't do
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.360]  that now now that that's illegal so how did it all end
[55:31.360 --> 55:35.120]  they finally took me off of them and i just you know as i started
[55:35.120 --> 55:38.720]  becoming older i didn't need it anymore you know
[55:38.720 --> 55:42.000]  uh my my thought patterns were leveled out i guess that's why they want to get
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.880]  you when you're young so that so they can screw you up as
[55:44.880 --> 55:48.240]  early as possible and but see you you were able because of high
[55:48.240 --> 55:51.040]  intelligence to get over it most people they do that to end up being
[55:51.040 --> 55:54.560]  institutionalized and i saw a statistic a few years ago your four times more
[55:54.560 --> 55:57.200]  likely the feds even admit that people can pull this up
[55:57.200 --> 55:59.840]  i don't remember the exact study but it's it's there's been multiple studies
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.280]  that when you've been put on psychotropics or luvox or
[56:03.280 --> 56:07.920]  uh you know the aterol and stuff your four times more likely to end up on
[56:07.920 --> 56:10.960]  illegal drugs it totally primes you to want
[56:10.960 --> 56:14.000]  pharmacia oh yeah so i mean what do drug dealers do they start
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.200]  kids young yeah i mean you know in the high
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.120]  school what what did you know what most high school students would do back then
[56:21.120 --> 56:23.920]  well there's a huge black market now and people grinding up their aterol and
[56:23.920 --> 56:27.520]  they're riddling people snoring and that's what i hear and i and i go
[56:27.520 --> 56:30.960]  why would you do that because they also smoke the serotonin reuptake
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.360]  inhibitors that's hallucinogenic yeah well it see the weird thing was
[56:35.360 --> 56:39.040]  you know riddling when people say that they snored it and do it and riddling
[56:39.040 --> 56:43.040]  worked reversal on me it mellowed me out to a point
[56:43.040 --> 56:46.560]  which was kind of weird that's why they gave me the dexadrin to bring me back
[56:46.560 --> 56:51.920]  up now when i hear about these kids doing riddling i said well why would you do
[56:51.920 --> 56:56.000]  that you couldn't go to sleep no it gives it's an upper for them
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.120]  well i mean it does work on some people to settle them down but what you don't
[56:59.120 --> 57:02.240]  want was the red dyes the chemicals what just last week another study came out
[57:02.240 --> 57:06.720]  that it was the fertilizers doing it on kids in the fruits and vegetables you
[57:06.720 --> 57:10.800]  you were aware of that yeah but more importantly they admit that the chemicals
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.400]  in the bisphenol a oh was affecting reproduction and was affecting mood
[57:16.400 --> 57:19.360]  their drugging is through the packaging on purpose
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.120]  that's what the white house science are said 40 years ago
[57:23.120 --> 57:27.600]  yeah but they forget about you know stuff that's genetic
[57:27.600 --> 57:33.920]  and you know my brother his child has supposedly ADHD and he once put her on
[57:33.920 --> 57:37.680]  Adderall and i said no no no do not do that don't
[57:37.680 --> 57:41.440]  there's nothing wrong with her did he get her off of it yes
[57:41.440 --> 57:44.480]  he finally got our sacrifice our children the altar of these screwed up
[57:44.480 --> 57:48.240]  schools i'd rather my kid be an artist and not make any money and just be happy

[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:36.640]  imagine we said in north korea kim jong-un
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:40.880]  besides what the kids eat you go that dirty dictator
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:44.880]  but here it's like oh my gosh he's our mummy it's good to have women tell you
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:47.920]  what to do that's very feminist she's a total front
[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:50.160]  folks she doesn't come up with what the kids are fed
[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:54.320]  they have actuaries by the big agri-companies to gobble up the market
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:01:58.240]  bow and the gates are involved to feed kids the worst crap gmo
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:02.720]  worse than prison food and then it's like but it's a black lady promoting it
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:06.800]  you're not racist are you they have disinfo articles about
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:10.000]  under her plan kids would have salad bars they always had salad bars now
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.200]  they've gotten rid of them i know my kids were in private
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:16.480]  school two years ago three years ago
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:20.400]  half the week like three days a week it's one of those staggered home school
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:23.280]  private schools a nice christian private school big one
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:27.040]  but they said we're accredited so you know these handouts would come home and
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:32.080]  these these cds from the federal department about you know with
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:35.360]  her telling you you know this is what you're supposed to eat
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:41.040]  and it was like white bread and lunchables and like gmo crap i mean we
[1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:44.480]  we've all seen the photos online on twitter of the young people fighting
[1:02:44.480 --> 1:02:50.080]  back and showing everybody what the school
[1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:52.720]  food looks like
[1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:57.040]  and it looks worse than the stuff you've seen in pbs
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:02.080]  documentaries inside prisons i remember when i went to public
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:05.520]  school you could eat healthy if you wanted to but they had chicken
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:10.000]  fried steaks they had salads they had everything it was pretty good food
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.840]  like my mouth just started watering thinking back to the school food we had
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:20.800]  when i was in dallas and by the time i moved my last few years to austin the
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:25.200]  school food wasn't very good and then now i see what it's like
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:28.240]  and i've seen the school food i've been in some schools and i mean it is
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:32.160]  literally beyond prison food a hamburger is like some weird
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:36.320]  stale fake bread buns with like a rotten
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:40.160]  tomato and a weird dehydrated pickle on it
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:42.480]  and
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:47.120]  i mean it's just beyond gross ladies and gentlemen
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:50.720]  and it'll always taste weird they found some of the photos that's nothing i
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:53.760]  remember the blaze had them a few months ago it was like
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:57.600]  school lunch program would you eat this or worse than prisons yeah there it is
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:02.960]  i mean imagine imagine eating food that looks like that it just it's beyond
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:05.920]  prison and i've been in jail i don't know four or five
[1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:09.280]  times protesting and a couple times fighting
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:13.280]  yeah never any convictions but the cops show up everybody's bloody you know
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:17.440]  that everybody just goes to jail then they let the court sort of order it out
[1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:22.800]  and i mean i remember being in juvenile detention i don't know three times or so
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:26.560]  and i remember the food was better than that right there
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:29.440]  i remember being in
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.320]  rock wall dallas and taro detention
[1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:38.880]  and the food was better than what they serve kids in school
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:41.280]  right now
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:48.320]  in fact a couple times i was in jail they would just bring you fast food
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:52.160]  which wasn't good for you but i mean you compare it to these school lunches
[1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:56.480]  i mean it looks like something out of a gulag but why not parents will put
[1:04:56.480 --> 1:05:00.560]  up with it the sky is the limit huh
[1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:04.240]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself
[1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:07.760]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day
[1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:11.680]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:15.360]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:19.680]  and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[1:05:19.680 --> 1:05:23.920]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states
[1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:27.920]  well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions
[1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:31.200]  and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:34.720]  allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear

[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:15.280]  and the gcn radio network
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:20.640]  drought concerns they're very real in the american southwest
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:24.240]  and here in the state of texas many texas cities and communities
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:27.600]  have less than 90 days of water in their reserve and that's not even counting
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:31.360]  the water gouging that would surely take place during some type of crisis
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:34.480]  now there are reasonable water rationing measures in effect
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:38.800]  such as using gray water water from your sink or your bathtub that you store in
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:41.040]  a tank to water your grass at a later date
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:44.560]  and that sounds perfectly fine but there are more extreme measures not only
[1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:48.640]  being proposed but also active in at least one texas city
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:52.000]  so in the name of sustainability would you drink water
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  that was once in your toilet can ask you what measures do you take to keep
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:02.400]  yourself hydrated what measures um i drink a full glass of water every
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:05.840]  morning a full glass of water before exercising a full glass of water before
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:08.800]  bed and water in between i stop at most of the water
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:11.680]  fountains on the trail do you guys stop at the water fountain so you're drinking
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:14.720]  city water yes and what type of water do you drink
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:18.480]  city water or some other type um city water city water
[1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:22.320]  okay did you know that the city of austin is considering uh making
[1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:25.920]  toilet water drinking water that's disgusting it's disgusting that's
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:28.320]  disgusting would you would you drink the toilet water
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:32.960]  no a city on west texas i think it's a big spring texas yeah yeah i've heard of
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:35.520]  them doing i thought they were crazy for it do you let your dog drink out of the
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:39.600]  toilet no no okay would you drink out of the
[1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:44.560]  toilet what do you think
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:47.600]  we're all gonna have to answer that question soon i guess right
[1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:51.040]  also you've heard you've heard about this you drink a lot of water so you
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:53.680]  know you want to stay hydrated you want to stay healthy especially as it gets
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:56.960]  hotter here in the state of texas so drinking your water morning noon and
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:59.600]  night would you drink the toilet water i would not
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:03.120]  could it ever be clean enough for you to drink it
[1:10:03.120 --> 1:10:06.960]  um they would have to prove that it's clean enough would you consider
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:11.200]  drinking the water if you knew it was no no not if i knew toilet water was it
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:15.920]  yes i don't want to hear more about it how clean is clean
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:21.520]  how clean would it have to be uh it would have to be as clean as the water we
[1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:24.720]  drink now and some people think our tap water is not cleaning
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:28.960]  enough now um they'd be fine if i knew it was okay to drink
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.040]  maybe how would you know how clean is clean how clean would it have to be
[1:10:33.040 --> 1:10:37.040]  i don't know that's a good question now this is the last ditch effort it's
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:40.160]  nothing that they so much want to do but they're thinking that if the
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:42.960]  drought continues it may get to the point where they have to drink the
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:47.760]  toilet water so could the water ever be clean enough
[1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:52.400]  i don't i don't think so why do we need to resort to that well we have a water
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:54.800]  rationing in effect you know there's a drought going on and
[1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:58.480]  that yeah but so you're saying it's it can never get to the point where you'd
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:02.720]  want to drink toilet water it depends on the scientific process of
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:06.160]  what's used to purify it you know and i'll also tell you that uh here in the
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.720]  city of austin they floor date the water and there've been a
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:12.160]  Harvard studies about fluoride reducing people's IQs
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:15.760]  i think i'm pretty smart still fluoride in the water and the mayor of austin you
[1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:18.640]  know gives you the finger yeah if you come in and talk about it
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:21.600]  oh i try to talk to my family about it and they just think i'm crazy
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:26.400]  Harvard studies about fluoride reducing IQ levels
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:30.320]  well i guess that explains a lot all right thank you enjoying your workout
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:34.320]  miss thanks the city of big spring texas is
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:37.920]  already taking water from the toilet to the tap and through a multi-stage
[1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:41.440]  cleaning process a representative for the texas water development board
[1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:45.440]  says it tastes just as good as any bottle water
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:49.440]  it tasted uh not unlike any other drinking water
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:53.040]  whether it's from the tap here in the city of austin or bald of those arco
[1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:57.360]  water um and yes i'd recommend it i i recommend any water supply that is
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:01.920]  readily available and reliable and safe so while the final decision concerning
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:05.360]  the toilet water may be a ways off the city of austin can improve
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:08.960]  health immediately by simply removing fluoride from the water
[1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:12.800]  you can find more reports at info wars dot com
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:17.200]  yeah that that may work for little creatures like my dog but
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:22.880]  i can ease texas town close to toilet the tap loop
[1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:27.760]  is this our future water supply and they go on to say that austin has been
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:32.160]  doing such a good job saving water that we're not going to get toilet
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:37.600]  water recycled and again it's good to save water and not waste it
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:44.080]  but they just want you to not waste it to double triple charge you
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:47.520]  i wanted to intro the second hour with that jacari jackson piece that's the
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:51.920]  type of reports you see every night seven o'clock central with info wars
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:55.040]  nightly news with stories that affect not just
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:13:00.160]  the us or texas but the entire world they want to put you in a 200 square foot
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:04.800]  apartment and charge you as much as a 2000 square foot apartment
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:07.680]  they want to put you in a tiny car and charge you ten dollars a gallon for
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:11.520]  gas or the equivalent for coal power that's
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:15.920]  transferred into electricity that's the model
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:20.480]  of agenda 21 is artificial scarcity and people better
[1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:25.440]  understand that ladies and gentlemen now we are joined with a quick update by
[1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:30.560]  paul joseph watson from copenhagen denmark

[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:48.160]  from our sources but also from public statements in their spiegel
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:52.560]  by one of the builderberg group members admitting that they basically run the
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:55.680]  planet that they're establishing a planetary regime
[1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:59.760]  that they're more powerful than davos davos is kind of one of their public
[1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:05.760]  events that's why prime minister of england went
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:11.120]  there last year while i was covering it while i was being detained by police for
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:14.480]  trying to rent a boat to go down the canal to get a
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:19.200]  shot of him there we forced them to admit that he was an attendee
[1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:22.320]  and that he violated different federal laws in england
[1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:26.400]  as you cannot have the prime minister meeting secretly at a lobbyist meeting
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:31.040]  that's what this is but they didn't want you to ever know it existed
[1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:36.640]  i remember 10 years ago they would have the new york times literally say that
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:39.120]  we were insane no such group existed in fact
[1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:46.640]  forget that in 2009 the new york times reviewed a film called the new world
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:50.000]  order that aired on the independent film channel that i was in
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:54.960]  and they literally said mr jones had a full on schizophrenic break
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:58.400]  total break with reality and was in the woods in virginia
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:02.320]  imagining sedans and men in black glasses and a secret meeting and they
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:06.320]  said there was no meeting and we had footage of marines
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:09.200]  we had footage of helicopter secret service turned out hillary and obama
[1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:11.760]  were in the meeting years later that was their secret meeting when no one could
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:17.040]  find obama for a day it was there it happened we caught world leaders with
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:20.240]  their national anthems playing and they just came out in the new york times and
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:24.160]  said it didn't exist just like they say if you have a
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:28.720]  business you didn't build that just like they say that raising the debt
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:33.120]  limit doesn't raise the debt limit just like they say there is no $5,000 fine
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:36.480]  starting this year for people that don't get obama care it's in the stinking
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:40.960]  bill everyone will be affected next year
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.320]  they just say there is no fee there are no death panels
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:47.680]  um you will keep your doctor it will lower your bill
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:52.240]  to the price of a phone bill or a cable bill
[1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:56.240]  i guess if you've got 10 different cable packages maybe
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:16:00.960]  maybe you own a small hotel and pay for 10 packages maybe but not one
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:05.520]  it's doubling prices conservatively this is what we deal with well guess what
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:12.000]  now thanks to info wars dot com world that daily dot com drugs report dot com
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:17.360]  the epoch times they helped break it as well in the last decade
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:22.320]  american free press and others because of that fact they now have to admit it
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:24.960]  exist but they go it's no big deal
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:28.880]  yeah it's world leaders meeting a secret royalty bankers
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:32.720]  head of google but don't worry about it it's kooky to even care
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:36.960]  let me tell you what happened last year in england you've seen the video
[1:16:36.960 --> 1:16:40.160]  about 3000 people showed up to hear me speak
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:43.520]  on the green there the police told us they were listeners and didn't like
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:48.480]  bill berg and we're not lying and and rolled the red carpet out for us
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:53.600]  in most cases there were a few that were jerks low-level ones
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:56.880]  but i've never been treated so well by police
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:17:01.600]  and they gave us intel well regional police came and met with us and were
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:05.600]  nice and then local police were nice i ran into some guys from mi-5 gave us
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:08.800]  really good intel uh and they just said point blank no we
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:11.920]  know this is horrible for our country we know it's bad you know we're allowed to
[1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:16.560]  have opinions as citizens yeah it's terrible it's illegal we believe
[1:17:16.560 --> 1:17:19.680]  people don't want to be slaves folks you got a working-class attitude in
[1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:22.720]  england where people still understand especially those that aren't dumb
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:25.520]  that having a bunch of insiders meet is bad for everybody
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:29.040]  and and set agendas in secret and it's illegal
[1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:32.240]  so we've come a long way i'm gonna skip this network breaks we can talk to paul
[1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:34.480]  watson give the number out and take your calls
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:41.520]  but bill berg 2014 is a big deal because we just got the internal list
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:44.720]  it's it's going up right now at info wars.com
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:48.080]  then we're going to add photos documents and intel to the bottom of it but we
[1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:52.000]  have the 2014 list it's going up at info wars.com in mere
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.560]  minutes in mere minutes joining us from kopenhagen tomorrow
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:00.400]  he'll be on with us via video skype 30 minutes into the show
[1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:04.000]  and if there's any big events or or any attempts to stop our reporters
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.360]  he'll be doing live feeds as well on ustream and other systems
[1:18:07.360 --> 1:18:10.480]  paul give us an update since you got there yesterday
[1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:13.680]  uh were you able to get into the hotel or are you banned
[1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:18.320]  as i was in england and as you were in england give us the data dump paul watson
[1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:21.440]  reporting for info wars.com
[1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:24.880]  hi alex good to be right yeah i've actually checked into the marriott right
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:28.640]  now and they've blocked off second floor of the
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:32.720]  hotel so the rope around the stairs in the lobby
[1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:36.080]  and and if you take the elevator up to the second floor you're
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:40.000]  quickly escorted back into the elevator so
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:43.360]  they've let us in this time which differs obviously from last year where we
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:47.120]  were kicked out three days beforehand we were told that we were a
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:51.200]  security threat at watford last year the grove
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:56.000]  this year they've let us check in but preparations have already
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:00.320]  very visibly taking place build about 2014 the security is
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:05.120]  extremely paranoid for as much as a half a mile surrounding the
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:08.960]  entire hotel but we've checked into the marriott where
[1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:14.240]  here reporting from the scene it's now gone up on info wars.com we
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:18.160]  have the official 2014 list that went up literally
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:21.760]  minutes ago on the official bill de berg meeting's website which again they
[1:19:21.760 --> 1:19:25.840]  didn't have till six years ago under massive pressure
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:30.160]  they have been forced to let some of the sound official bill de berg 2014
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.880]  membership list released official list on this
[1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:37.840]  year's bill de berg attendees uh has now been
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:41.280]  released the key we're going to add this note at the bottom of their official
[1:19:41.280 --> 1:19:43.520]  list and point out that this is their official list
[1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:46.640]  and have a link saying here here's where it comes from and then under that
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:49.840]  we're going to have a note so people understand this is world leaders
[1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:52.800]  meeting in secret they tried to deny this existed in the past
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:56.080]  we have forced in previous years to have them admit it
[1:19:56.080 --> 1:20:00.160]  is real and then we have your latest article reposted under it paul
[1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:04.160]  and we're going to make note of that uh that you have been able from your sources
[1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:07.040]  to find out what they're really concerned with this year
[1:20:07.040 --> 1:20:12.320]  and what is going to be on their agenda and and what the main focus is
[1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:17.200]  but paul obviously shoot video of them throwing you off the elevator
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:20.480]  i'd come out with your iphone rolling and put that on youtube
[1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:24.000]  how is ustream working give us a little preview of what you're going to be able
[1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:26.880]  to do inside the hotel
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:32.240]  well the fact that they've let us in is a big surprise because
[1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:35.760]  as far as half a mile away right across the water
[1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:39.040]  police are going around to the local ice cream sellers
[1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:42.400]  and telling them to watch out for suspicious people
[1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:46.960]  walking next to the water so they've done it a little bit differently at least
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:50.160]  they're letting us in but you can tell that you know compared to
[1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:54.080]  what for last year the the security setup is very
[1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:57.920]  more paranoid but where inside the hotel they
[1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:01.760]  rolled off the second floor the organizers for the actual
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:06.640]  conference are already here yeah let's be clear used to they threw you out
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:09.600]  thursday morning they threw it arriving thursday evening
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:13.280]  uh now when i get there even three days before they're just alex you're not
[1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:15.600]  allowed here the police are there they throw us out
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:18.160]  they go to the local hotel where we're staying so you don't give this guy
[1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:21.680]  service we caught that on tape in virginia last year
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:25.680]  just un or no two years ago was in virginia last year was england
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:29.280]  unprecedented how the police behaved in virginia very unamerican very north
[1:21:29.280 --> 1:21:32.880]  korean so to be clear you haven't been thrown out yet
[1:21:32.880 --> 1:21:39.200]  they may have missed your name uh i think you should be ready for that paul
[1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:44.560]  i'm surprised because um outside you know the entrance to the hotel
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:48.320]  there were tourists with cameras who weren't even taking pictures they just
[1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:51.840]  had you know canon cameras slung around their backs
[1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:55.440]  and security people were walking up to them and
[1:21:55.440 --> 1:21:59.200]  being very domineering and saying you're not allowed to take pictures well lots
[1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:02.160]  and let's just say it you you're like six foot three
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:07.120]  and you look extremely aristocratic so i mean no i mean you look like a model
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:10.560]  in person so that's why you're being left alone in Denmark
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:14.160]  no i know that's why you're being left alone i know exactly that that's what's
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:16.480]  going on
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:21.440]  now but yeah i mean they're walking up to people who aren't even taking pictures
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:24.880]  and harassing them um and even right across the
[1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:28.960]  water they're talking to the local tradesmen and the people who own the
[1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:31.440]  boats that sail right by the hotel and
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:35.200]  trying to intimidate them out of you know taking protesters on board there's
[1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:38.560]  still a chance that we might be able to do that but we'll wait and see
[1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:41.680]  okay so so so they are talking to people saying don't give boat rides
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:45.360]  on the nearby water describe the water that's around the hotel
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:49.440]  and we'll put it on google maps guys all week we're going to have google maps
[1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:52.800]  of the marriott there and we're going to be showing that and mcbraines putting
[1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:55.680]  together a data package of all that that i was
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:59.120]  requesting last week go ahead
[1:23:00.080 --> 1:23:04.880]  yeah basically obviously one side of the marriott faces out onto the
[1:23:04.880 --> 1:23:08.960]  the water streaming through and the other side you know faces out onto the
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:13.920]  industrial sector and the rest of the city uh there's a bridge that connects
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:19.040]  the marriott and there's there are people with microphones patrolling that
[1:23:19.040 --> 1:23:22.000]  bridge on a regular basis i saw that from the hotel room
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:26.400]  a little bit earlier they actually upgraded my hotel room to a waterfront
[1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:30.720]  view so that was nice well watching watching i want you to get
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:34.240]  on that boat very paranoid i want you to get on those boats
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:38.400]  and get footage from the water facility are they putting up a fence a makeshift
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:43.120]  riot fence like they did in wafford last year in england
[1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:47.600]  they're doing that tomorrow i've been told that the space that the police have
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:51.200]  afforded is very near the hotel compared to last
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:56.160]  year it's literally across the road um the fences that are in place now
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:24:00.400]  are there permanently so you can see through them that's no big deal but
[1:24:00.400 --> 1:24:04.240]  they're going to put bollards up they're going to erect a fence tomorrow
[1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:08.000]  i've been told immediately in front of that parking lot
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.480]  area which is being afforded to the protesters and then there are separate
[1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:18.720]  areas near an hotel but um have been given to us though
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:22.640]  and i'm here with charlie skelton and hannah
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:28.800]  who can talk to you as well about the preparation
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:33.760]  now watson again uh we had incredible mega thunderstorms covering half the
[1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:37.120]  state yesterday literally so the flights were all cancelled out of
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:41.200]  houston to get our reporters out there to you david night and
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:47.440]  josh owens they'll be there tonight late tonight and so get ready tomorrow
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:51.680]  they're going to be there to help you uh you know cover the fence going up
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:55.760]  make contact obviously with the bartenders with the workers that
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:59.360]  when they treat you horrible when they're bad give them your business card so
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:04.640]  they can contact you later with any information what else are you planning
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:09.600]  um yeah the the thing about the staff is
[1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:13.520]  they're obviously very reluctant to tell us anything we've already tried to
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:17.040]  talk to them and it's basically a complete lockdown
[1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:20.880]  but as i said we're going to get nearer than we did last year
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:24.960]  we're here until tomorrow early afternoon which is when we have to check
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:27.520]  out so basically we got the rest of today and
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:30.480]  tomorrow morning and we're getting you know closer
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:34.080]  access than we did last year so hopefully we're going to get more
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:38.960]  inside information compared to last year um
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:43.200]  but as i said it's it's a whole lot more paranoid than it was
[1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:47.120]  last time around because they've allowed us in but
[1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:51.760]  i'm looking at the stairs up to the second floor they put a red rope across
[1:25:51.760 --> 1:25:55.040]  it they they've blocked it off they've got people guarding it
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:58.240]  they've got people outside the front of the hotel harassing tourists
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:01.920]  simply carrying cameras they're not even taking photographs
[1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:06.000]  um i'm looking at the actual attendee list you know you've got rasmus in there
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:09.920]  from nato so as i said in the article earlier they're extremely concerned
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:14.080]  about this this agenda for the unipolar world falling apart
[1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:16.800]  which obviously centers around putin and ukraine
[1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:20.480]  we've had top globalists saying that russia is basically being kicked out of
[1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:23.200]  the new old order you got the revolution in europe with the
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:27.120]  anti-eu parties winning the euro elections in the uk
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:31.600]  danmark and france so this is absolutely crucial for bill
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:34.960]  de berg this is probably one of the most crucial
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:40.880]  meetings since the 60s or the 70s so it's very important
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:47.040]  and charlie skelton from the guardian is here so i can put him on if you want a
[1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:50.640]  quick word with him absolutely we'd love to talk to charlie skelton let's
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:53.920]  let's do that right now again we have to give the guardian credit
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.200]  in the last eight years or so they've been covering it and not just
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:01.920]  making jokes about it and charlie's been arrested you name it repeatedly
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:05.760]  uh but he did a great job in england last year helping organize so much of it
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:09.680]  with his wife the actual protest so you got to love that guardian
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:13.440]  rider helping organize the protest charlie skelton thank you for joining us
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:17.280]  what's your what's your breakdown on what you're seeing sir
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:20.480]  well i'm seeing i'm staring now at the uh participant list
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:23.760]  which is it seems to be a very powerful bill de berg this year i mean they're
[1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:27.440]  always powerful but there seems to be a big one um you know the head of mi6 the
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:32.000]  head of nato the supreme ally commander of europea here and uh
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:35.200]  and they're and they're interestingly here with um people like
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:39.920]  general portray us who now works for henry cravis at kkr now kkr is a big
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:43.520]  speculator on war you know that's that's where they make their money they're
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:45.920]  they're they're not the nicest people in the world
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.440]  um anyway they're they're going to be uh i guess discussing some of the things
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:53.920]  going on and then geographically and uh and we'll be standing nearby taking
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:57.920]  photographs of them if they arrive in the limousine or trying to now i was
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:02.320]  thrown out with watson two days before it began in wadford last year we were
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:05.040]  in the restaurant actually and they came in and you know said get up and leave and
[1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:10.960]  i just kept eating and finished my wine uh but long story short um
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:14.000]  how were you guys able to get in if they're even telling tourists
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.480]  300 yards outside the facility not to take photos
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:23.200]  well you know i mean the it's a kind of slightly fluid situation
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:28.880]  and um you know we're here we're gonna go for dinner here i hope and uh and just
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:32.160]  have a a nice time and soak up the extremely expensive
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:36.240]  atmosphere uh and then worry about the cost uh tomorrow
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:40.720]  um but it's you know it's it's still winding up and it'll wind up
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:44.320]  now for the next few days until you know obviously reaches
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:49.280]  on thursday the sort of peak of uh the security and it's you know it's a big
[1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:53.520]  operation and uh and we're right the the location is
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:58.240]  is just a couple of hundred yards from the main administrative center of the
[1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:02.320]  Copenhagen police so it's you know it's in some ways it's interesting they put
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:05.440]  there they're holding it right in the middle of the city so you know good
[1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:09.200]  for people that want to come and say hello take some photos report on it
[1:29:09.200 --> 1:29:13.760]  but also you know right next to the police station so i think it should be
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:16.720]  you know it's a sunny day today i think it should be a good build of it i mean
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:20.560]  it obviously it's missing your presence sailing down a barge bullhorning
[1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:24.800]  um which is a memory i won't forget nary um but uh

[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:52.880]  and charlie skelton writes for the guardian and its sister newspaper
[1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:57.440]  the observer and his stories have been widely circulated probably the top
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:01.840]  coverage at the last uh five six seven years of bill berg has been at the
[1:34:01.840 --> 1:34:05.040]  guardian much of it is that's a big deal there's a reason the
[1:34:05.040 --> 1:34:09.520]  guardians number one in europe not just in england and it's because it covers
[1:34:09.520 --> 1:34:13.520]  globalism it covers the new world order it covers real stories
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:18.320]  it covers the nsa whistleblowers uh and then they've been threatening to arrest
[1:34:18.320 --> 1:34:20.400]  members of the guardian so i've got to give it
[1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:23.520]  credit where it's due drudge report dot com
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:28.880]  has linked to the official bill berg 2014 attendee list that we have mirrored
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:31.760]  from their site we're also going to add to the bottom of it yesterday they
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.280]  released the official agenda which i can assure you will not be the real
[1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:38.640]  agenda being covered because they'll have these official meetings and then the
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:41.520]  little breakaways is where the real criminal stuff's
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:45.040]  going on by the way mainstream british news last year said it was
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:49.600]  illegal i mean they are setting policy in secret
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:52.720]  going back to charlie skelton i know you'll have a lot more tomorrow
[1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:55.600]  and throughout the weekend we'll have live coverage again sunday as it all
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:59.840]  ends on the sunday broadcast as well i may even just have david night and paul
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:02.800]  watson if the skype is good host the sunday show
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.480]  with myself just calling in so i don't dominate the discussion
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:10.640]  i have to kind of exclude myself or wild horses can't drag me away but
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:16.160]  other points you think are important uh or other observations charlie skelton
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:18.880]  well from the agenda i would differently i mean
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:21.920]  whether they're discussing as i they're certainly saying now they're discussing
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:26.320]  the question does privacy exist which you know for an organization that values
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:29.600]  privacy as much as bill that does it's a curious question but interesting they're
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:33.040]  discussing does about the discussing privacy with um
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:36.000]  you know the head executive chairman of google eric schmidt and
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:41.120]  head of linkedin reid hoffman and uh people like uh alex carp from palantir
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:46.880]  technologies so these are kind of big players in the uh new media and and
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:50.080]  and that world so you know in a world where you know
[1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:54.640]  we the people are extremely transparent uh it's interesting that they would ask
[1:35:54.640 --> 1:35:57.600]  does privacy exist and you know it's a question everyone should actually be
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:01.520]  asking perhaps not in the way they're asking because they're
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:06.240]  uh you know their idea of privacy and i'll probably differ
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:09.040]  and the importance of privacy probably differs but um i think that's
[1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:12.240]  interesting the privacy in a post-snowden world you know is at the
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:16.000]  center of the bill de berg discussion
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:19.600]  well i think you make a really good point there that these guys are just such
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:23.360]  hypocrites on every front schmidt who's a frequent attendee
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:27.920]  the head of google he wants to be secret uh he had youtube takedown videos that
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:31.920]  we posted of him uh hiking up the mountain a few years ago in switzerland
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:36.080]  and they put them back up later when there was protest i just don't get how
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:39.280]  they want to live in one world and then we live in another
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:42.480]  why don't they just want everybody to be free i just don't get how they think
[1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:46.240]  they're important but we're not well i know you know you know you end up with
[1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:51.200]  a slightly hunger games uh division of uh of society is
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:55.760]  as the bill de bergium zoom through uh the the ghettos
[1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:58.560]  you know what i mean i mean there's a slight you know there's obviously there's
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:03.040]  a double standard in a play you know when when when you're being held in a
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:07.520]  you know sort of police pen pointing a zoom lens at a group of world leaders
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:10.880]  which includes people like the head of the imf and two ministers from the
[1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:15.440]  uk uh and uh and a shadow minister as well um so
[1:37:15.440 --> 1:37:18.160]  these are politicians there's a lot of politicians here if you look at the
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:20.320]  list you'll see the number of elected officials
[1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:27.600]  officials sorry public servants um uh here you know it's staggering and uh
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:31.280]  and you know with where are the minutes from the meeting you know there are
[1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:34.240]  questions like that people should be asking you know this is a meeting where
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:37.520]  three day conference you know chance with the checker the head you know
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:40.320]  the head of the treasury in the uk is going to be here for three days it's
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:44.720]  probably his biggest uh you know engagement of the year officially
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:48.400]  i mean i wouldn't be surprised if it is and um and you know
[1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:51.520]  we need if that's happening and if there are so many politicians we need better
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:55.120]  coverage from the mainstream media it there's it's improving certainly but
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:58.880]  we need more and we need more transparency from the uh from the
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:02.480]  politicians who attend you know that seems i think reasonable and that's
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:06.560]  that's a double standard i think we can explode within the media and the
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:10.160]  generally and hopefully i say that i'm an optimist
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:13.360]  well you're absolutely right i mean i remembered again five years ago they
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:15.680]  wouldn't admit that the stock markets are rigged and that the
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:18.720]  interest rates are rigged now even rolling stone
[1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:22.160]  admits it and everything is rigged the biggest price fixing scandal ever
[1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:26.720]  look at libor look at the big european banks the u.s is doing it as well
[1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:29.760]  fixing interest rates to screw the general public
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:32.960]  where the elite get basically free interest we have to pay interest
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:36.400]  even if we have good credit rigging things
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:41.040]  is a big deal and and we're there showing where it's being rigged
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:47.520]  and it's just simply amazing that we have forced the bigger establishment
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:51.200]  aligned media to cover this because believe me folks
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:54.880]  uh a decade ago if mainstream media covered bill deberg you would lose
[1:38:54.880 --> 1:38:58.160]  your job charlie skelton thank you so much for the time
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:01.680]  and you can hand that back over to paul watson and i can't wait to see you
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:04.960]  reporting at the london guardian
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:08.000]  all right final comments from paul watson and then i'm going to go to your
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:14.720]  phone calls and cover second amendment news economic news uh the first lady
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:17.280]  controlling what's on our school lunch menu news
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:21.440]  she's going to respond to critics now how dare you want to be able to
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:25.280]  have your kitty what you want why under their rules in chicago schools
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:29.120]  you're not allowed to pack lunch she decides and it's going to go nationwide
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:33.680]  now that's like north korea again where kim jong-un decides
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:36.080]  what people eat i mean i just can't handle it folks
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:39.280]  this is authoritarianism and we're going to expose
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:43.760]  who pulls the strings on michelle obama and who pulls the strings on david
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:46.640]  cameron and who pulls the strings on angela
[1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:50.240]  merkel paul watson any other comments that
[1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:55.760]  you think are important um i would emphasize that we need to
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:39:59.840]  post the the agenda which is also on the bill deberg meetings website as well
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:02.400]  as the list because they've announced the agenda
[1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:07.520]  and aside from some very interesting other discussion topics
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:14.080]  listed are ukraine and the future of europe what's next for europe which
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:16.880]  obviously in the article i posted earlier today
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:20.960]  ukraine and europe were the main focus obviously you have
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:24.880]  mr mesha schmidt uh morten mesha schmidt who
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:28.400]  won the euro elections in denmark you have nigel frage
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:33.120]  uh for u-kip in the united kingdom and you have marine lepen in france so that
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:37.920]  this kind of um far right the media calls it revolution it's really
[1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:41.200]  libertarian tea party we know pin we know forage
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:45.120]  we know them all their aaron paul fans lepen was good buddies with bob
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:50.160]  chatman on record they are these are libertarian listeners of this show
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:52.960]  who have common sense look at the tea party sweeping
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:58.720]  in in um in primaries all over the u.s the globalists are concerned and they
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:03.440]  were concerned in 2006 about the quote liberty movement and ron paul
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:06.640]  we got that directly from bill deberg in 2006
[1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:10.800]  an excellent source i have to know who it is i'm gonna leave it at that
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:14.800]  i'll just say it's a major banker i mean the system knows who it is
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.400]  uh but the point is said they're gonna implode
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:22.080]  the housing market to bankrupt the american people in 2008
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:26.320]  we reported that two years before on video with estalan
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:30.400]  in a bar two miles from the bill deberg meeting his sources are real
[1:41:30.400 --> 1:41:36.080]  he's coming up in the next hour uh so how how big a deal is that
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:40.000]  i mean it's massive deal obviously you mentioned the german magazine article
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.360]  a week ago saying that bill deberg is more powerful than dabbos you have
[1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:48.560]  nato secretary general willy class from belgium in 2010 saying that
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:52.480]  bill deberg members are a mandate to implement you know the decisions in
[1:41:52.480 --> 1:41:55.520]  their relatives years of influence then we have this
[1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:59.520]  this topic on the agenda which is who will pay for the demographics
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:03.600]  now to me that appears as if it's not a monetary sense who will pay for the
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:06.320]  demographics it's the cultural and a social
[1:42:06.320 --> 1:42:09.440]  identity that's the price that people are going to pay
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.960]  obviously this this conservative revolution is based on
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:16.800]  anti immigration policies throughout europe
[1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:20.320]  people are really getting behind that in europe so because they're bringing in
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:24.160]  giant masses of people giving them free welfare making them the new social
[1:42:24.160 --> 1:42:27.520]  workers and the government is literally overthrowing
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:31.520]  all existing liberty with the giant third world desperate populations
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:35.200]  who we have nothing against but you know literally uh this is an
[1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:40.720]  overwrite and and and an extermination of western culture
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:43.680]  no and we talked to dames earlier and they were very clear
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:47.840]  that mass immigration was a problem but it was you know it was not the immigrant
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:42:52.160]  soul it was being pushed from above so then you also have
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:56.320]  discussions about china's increasing power u krain what's next for europe
[1:42:56.320 --> 1:42:59.600]  and talk of demographic and immigration so
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:03.360]  the three core issues that we identified this morning in the report in
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:07.840]  polls.com are being discussed at bill deberg
[1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:11.520]  ukraine obviously with putin top globalist saying that russia is now
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:14.720]  officially being kicked out the new world order of course it was
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:18.640]  it's kicked out of the g8 which has now become the g7 so
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:21.840]  you can go down the line they've they've got um
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:25.920]  intelligence officials here from britain several other people that talked
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:29.760]  about how special is the relationship in intelligence sharing their thing
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:34.560]  does privacy exist that's one of the other topics for discussion
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:40.400]  so this is absolutely crucial 2014 the convergence of global
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:44.960]  geopolitical economic development and this key meeting which as we said is
[1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:48.560]  more powerful than davos that's not us saying that that's bill deberg members
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:52.160]  saying that so this is really a crucial
[1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:56.080]  fissure in the the the set of the march towards
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:59.520]  world government it's in very severe danger of collapse which
[1:43:59.520 --> 1:44:03.440]  has been illustrated by the euro election results and notice their website
[1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:07.360]  looks like the state department website that's because if you look at 1954
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:11.360]  with the former nazis and others in the west you had british intelligence the
[1:44:11.360 --> 1:44:15.040]  state department and all of them setting up the first
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:18.720]  bill deberg they now admit they created the secret european union
[1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:22.480]  they've created the secret american union we're already in this
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:27.600]  and now they're bragging about it to major german magazines why do you think
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:31.440]  the on one side they deny any of this is happening
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:35.440]  but on the other side they throw it in our face they're doing it
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:39.600]  because the minority of people are into this kind of stuff and they don't read
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:42.720]  the news they don't read books they don't read anything so
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:46.160]  on the face of it they can you know justify it by saying it's
[1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:50.560]  it's just the private gathering to the media but as we know
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:55.440]  when the specific topics are released and we see that they mesh with
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:01.280]  global geopolitical development then it brings it to light that
[1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:05.440]  this is the center of the new world order engine room
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:11.360]  this is the core of the agenda has has been admitted by bill deberg members
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:15.120]  and the question is are we bad as journalists for wanting to see what
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:18.560]  they're talking about and what they're keeping secret they said they didn't
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:21.520]  exist they have a bunch of former nazis in it and
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:24.720]  their daughters like queen betricks the daughter of prince
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:27.920]  Bernhardt they've been involved in all these bid-rigging scams and
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:31.520]  lockheed payoff scandals i mean on record
[1:45:31.520 --> 1:45:35.920]  uh and and the the british media reports that having camera last year was
[1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:40.240]  illegal i mean it's important to cover this
[1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:45.280]  well the last time i checked there were no mainstream reports and we're talking
[1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:49.760]  about um two days out from the meeting of 120 of
[1:45:49.760 --> 1:45:53.680]  the world's global power brokers you know compare that to davos compare that to
[1:45:53.680 --> 1:45:57.600]  the g8 which is a continuation of the consensus
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:01.440]  which is set at bill deberg and there are no mainstream media reports
[1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:05.440]  whatsoever even though we have representatives of the mainstream
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:08.000]  media attending bill deberg so what does that tell you
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:12.880]  i mean where he is the ragtag band of independent journalists and bloggers
[1:46:12.880 --> 1:46:17.280]  trying desperately to cover this in the face of official oppression
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.040]  while it's being completely ignored by the mainstream i was watching cnn
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:24.800]  earlier in the hotel they were still talking about the missing malaysian
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:29.200]  plane that we're talking about supermodel goes on instagram for the first time
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:32.800]  completely mindless coming up the oscars and how to buy a
[1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:37.120]  sailboat yes and they wonder why for example cnn
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:41.200]  lost you know 48 percent of its audience in the past 12 months they wonder why
[1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:46.080]  how can they wonder any longer when we're right here at the center of the storm
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:49.520]  and there are no mainstream media reports whatsoever
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:53.600]  obviously there'll be a few tough pieces later in the week as his routine but
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:58.480]  i live now extremely limited in terms of coverage
[1:46:58.480 --> 1:47:01.520]  well this happens every year now the last five or six
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:05.600]  drudge links to the list starts linking to our articles
[1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:09.040]  starts linking to our reports and then it forces
[1:47:09.040 --> 1:47:12.400]  the media to cover it as soon as the guardian reports on it
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:15.520]  obviously then they'll also be forced to do that as well
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:19.760]  but i really appreciate you watch and stay safe shoot a lot of videos
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:23.680]  upload them to youtube a lot of live streams and we'll have you via
[1:47:23.680 --> 1:47:28.080]  video skype tomorrow 30 minutes in and maybe you can walk around the hotel
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:32.960]  with your laptop with the live feed or via the iphone
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.960]  but the reporters should be there with you tomorrow as well they get in

[2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:52.240]  berg but david night and um josh owens couldn't fly out of
[2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:55.840]  texas because literally thunderstorms i sat there and watched thunderstorms
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:00:59.360]  out the window all saturday and sunday all day off and on it was just
[2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:03.200]  spectacular it was like something out of a movie giant black clouds electricity
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:07.360]  storms flooding rivers and half the state had giant
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:10.800]  thunderstorms over it so all the air traffic was cancelled in houston a lot
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:14.560]  of other major cities like sandtonio so they couldn't get out flying out of uh
[2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:19.680]  i guess george bush was w h.w. bush
[2:01:19.680 --> 2:01:24.400]  flying over to kopenhagen uh but and it clicked to me once i was on air
[2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:28.880]  wait a minute paul watson's there we're supposed to get paul watson on today
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:33.920]  that's been set for weeks uh and so uh we had paul watson on that's why we
[2:01:33.920 --> 2:01:39.120]  send reporters to our own countries is to cover news
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:42.240]  events and i just was it was clicking for me
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:45.680]  that we get so busy myself included just looking at all the news as it comes out
[2:01:45.680 --> 2:01:49.840]  we forget we're reporters actually out there covering
[2:01:49.840 --> 2:01:56.160]  events as they unfold but daniel estalan is going to be joining us and he
[2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:01.520]  always has really powerful intel in fact i should have queued it up
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:04.640]  it's an in game maybe you guys can find in game on youtube it's got like four
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:09.200]  million views on the one and skip ahead about an hour into it
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:14.880]  or so where you see estalan in a bar talking
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:18.320]  and that's where you'll find him saying they're going to implode the housing
[2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:22.000]  market in two years and blah blah blah from his sources and then it happened
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.720]  exactly as he said and they're worried about the militia they're
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:28.000]  worried about the ron paul liberty movement that became the tea party the
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:32.640]  term tea party wasn't even out then wasn't being associated with ron paul
[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:35.520]  until right around that time and that's what they're worried about and now look
[2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:40.240]  in europe how then proto you know nationalism has
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:45.040]  returning and people are recognizing hey our
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:47.600]  laws are being made by unelected globalist secret
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:52.320]  bureaus and just the realization that that's happening you see that what's
[2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:56.480]  known as the tea party u kip is tea party aligned
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:03:00.560]  libertarian tea party same thing with the lapin movement
[2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:04.800]  same thing is happening in canada the u.s australia
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:08.400]  we're trying to rediscover western values and say no
[2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:13.040]  to globalist colonization the corporate anti-free market monopoly
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:19.040]  takeover that is busy scapegoating capitalism for all the
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:22.320]  drop in productivity the drop in standard of living
[2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:26.960]  this is a designed globalization to destroy the nation states and destroy
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:31.280]  the individual and make us all dependent i mean look at libya
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:35.600]  where now nato is in there training a new army to invade the rest of africa
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:38.720]  in the name of fighting al-qaeda they put in charge
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:46.160]  that's back in the news today in my stack is the new libyan army being
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:51.920]  created by nato they over through the country they put al-qaeda in charge

[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:18.720]  rural and city compounds exempt from what they do to us
[2:04:19.520 --> 2:04:24.960]  it is a decision to work towards absolute inequity absolute discrimination
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:30.880]  absolute fraud absolute hypocrisy while having

[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:55.280]  daniel uslan is with us for the balance of the hour via video skype
[2:09:55.280 --> 2:09:58.880]  from europe and daniel uslan is a best-selling
[2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:03.120]  author in 64 countries with the true story of the bill de berg group
[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:08.080]  translated into 41 languages including number one best-seller in spain
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:12.720]  and he now has written the book that we sell trans evolution
[2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:18.080]  the age of human deconstruction and how the paradigm changed for humanity that
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:22.160]  shall define its future and threaten its very existence
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:26.240]  and he joins us to give us his latest intel
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:32.400]  from his sources and again it's in my film in game that came out in 2007
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:36.240]  a full year and a half before the october 2008 crash
[2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:40.240]  it has the clip of him in it in the bar
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:43.920]  where we would all get together with reporters and share notes that his source
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:46.800]  who i later learned who his source was separate from daniel
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:51.040]  one of his sources um
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:54.400]  in finance i'll just leave it at that but i'm showing daniel i went inject on
[2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:56.880]  his sources we have some of our own sources as well
[2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:01.120]  tucker was a big one he had some good sources but those have dried up a little
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:03.840]  bit since his death last year a few weeks before
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:08.160]  bill de berg's will remember jim tucker the original bill de berg
[2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:11.760]  sleuth who read westbook peggler's articles in the 50s
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:15.200]  when jim was a big a sports writer a news writer nationwide he was a big
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:18.560]  syndicated columnist classic straw hat whole nine yards
[2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:21.040]  and he said there's no way a secret political grips meeting i would have
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:24.320]  heard about it this would be big news and then he began to sleuth it for
[2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:28.960]  decades when no one even knew the name of it but then estolin because he's in
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:32.880]  the continent of europe and went to a lot of these events where they got shot at
[2:11:32.880 --> 2:11:38.080]  in portugal and other cases was really able to get some amazing sources
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:41.280]  and so he joins us to give us the true intel
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:44.320]  agenda that he's been able to fair it out this year
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:47.120]  the the official list and what they claim their agenda
[2:11:47.120 --> 2:11:49.840]  is is now on their website bill de berg meetings dot org
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:53.360]  we have links to that up at info wars dot com
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.040]  and prison planet dot com drudge report dot com is linked to that right in the
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:01.200]  middle column of drudge but we have a boil down page that has both their
[2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:03.600]  official press release of what they say their agenda is
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:07.440]  and the official list at info wars dot com
[2:12:07.440 --> 2:12:10.400]  but daniel estolin of daniel estolin dot com
[2:12:10.400 --> 2:12:14.000]  joins us he's also the author of the octopus deception
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:18.640]  daniel so much to cover where would you like to begin
[2:12:19.600 --> 2:12:23.520]  again it's the bill de berg time of the year again it's i'm very happy to see
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:27.440]  that you're well and healthy and still going strong so we need us to say
[2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:30.880]  thanks for the invitation we can start i guess with the
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:36.800]  with the agenda items that have come to me from my source as you said
[2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:40.480]  about a week and a half ago now i wouldn't be
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:44.240]  particularly trust you of what the bill de berg say their agenda items are
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:48.400]  because a lot of the times the actual agenda
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:52.640]  list of discussion points and what has been published on our webpage is or
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:57.040]  is something watered down or complete fallacy especially if dealing
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:00.000]  with some thorny issues as we are this year
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:04.080]  so i can give you the seven out of about nine or ten items
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:07.920]  they'll be discussing number one uh nuclear diplomacy the coming
[2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:11.440]  the coming struggle over your ad nuclear uh packed
[2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:14.720]  this is one of the items it's very interesting to say because
[2:13:14.720 --> 2:13:19.520]  um obama's or the elites of the oligarchies or bill de berger's nightmares
[2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:26.240]  um russia china and iran working together against the uh the uh
[2:13:26.240 --> 2:13:31.120]  the will be powers of the world the second item i have uh for my sources is
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:34.640]  the consequences of russia china gas agreement on
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:38.560]  long-term cooperation needless to say bill de berg is going to be very very
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:40.960]  very angry at obama they're going to basically
[2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:44.560]  call him out and ask him what exactly he's planning to do
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:50.000]  i mean he've uh they've uh got the uh uh the the front door locked uh
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:54.480]  with uh allegedly with um
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:59.280]  with their uh uh i can't think of the word uh
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:06.160]  uh nato system exactly what they're with a boycott of
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:08.720]  of the russian economy just can't think of the word right now but what they
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:13.040]  forgot to do is the sanctions that's right that's right but they forgot to
[2:14:13.040 --> 2:14:15.840]  do is actually get the back door locked so the russians
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:18.960]  and the chinese gas agreement is needless to say something that
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:22.400]  especially the europeans are very worried about number three is the
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:26.400]  german nationalism through a prism of european unions
[2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:29.840]  political system and that's a very very interesting point because again we're
[2:14:29.840 --> 2:14:36.640]  dealing with the europe's biggest uh um nation economically and uh
[2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:39.680]  the fact that you're dealing with nationalism itself and again
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:42.720]  keep in mind that this list that i'm reading off right now
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:48.160]  came to me uh about a week before the elections european elections on sunday
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:52.320]  which showed how extreme left and right and basically nationalist parties
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:55.840]  across the continent have taken a very big chunk
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:00.160]  out of the traditional left right divide hegelian dialectic
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:03.760]  as we say uh in the european parliament and the fourth item
[2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:07.200]  is european unions internet privacy regulations
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:12.000]  and what it means for the united states fifth is cyber war and peace and again
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:14.880]  we're seeing a lot of that especially with the united states in china
[2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:20.560]  sixth point is from ukraine to syria is obama's foreign policy doomed again
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:24.800]  obama is going to be in the eye of the storm in this particular meeting needless
[2:15:24.800 --> 2:15:27.600]  to say american presidents sitting presidents never
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:33.520]  10 billion meetings although two would be uh presidents or soon to be elected
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:37.120]  presidents or presidential candidates have attended as was the case with bill
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:41.360]  clinton back in 1991 what's ended the bottom bottom conference and uh
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:44.960]  he was introduced to the north american free trade agreement for the first time
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:48.320]  at that meeting by david rockefeller and rockefeller at the time
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:52.880]  asked them uh theoretically if you were to be elected president mr clinton
[2:15:52.880 --> 2:15:57.280]  would you support nafta and uh clinton had no idea what nafta was
[2:15:57.280 --> 2:16:00.400]  asked rockefeller it was important to him and rockefeller said very important
[2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:03.760]  is that of course i would david and so rockefeller extended his hand and he
[2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:07.520]  said thank you mr president the rest is history alex as you know this is a
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:11.760]  story that i um go in somewhat more detail in my book the true story of the
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:17.120]  bill group group then the uh seventh item of nine or ten that i have
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:21.200]  is climate change ethical and economic challenges ahead again
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.200]  we're back to the same dental horse climate change and again it's just a
[2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:30.400]  uh metaphor for reducing the world's economy for deindustrialization zero
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:33.680]  growth um and uh we're seeing the effects of that on the
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:38.720]  world stage today so neo feudalism uh amazing so going over these points
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:41.520]  again and i want listeners understand estalon
[2:16:41.520 --> 2:16:45.600]  really does have bill berg sources we've confirmed that so
[2:16:45.600 --> 2:16:48.800]  this is so important what you're hearing that weeks ago
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:52.720]  he's now revealing that here to us exclusively we're very thankful
[2:16:52.720 --> 2:16:57.040]  that obviously who they say is on the list there's about 20 30 people that
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:00.640]  sneak in presidents prime ministers we're going to have our reporters there
[2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:03.920]  documenting that what they claim their agenda is
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:07.360]  will be a few little speeches they give to get around the fact that this is
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:11.040]  illegal in most countries to be setting policy in secret especially in england
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:14.880]  but also in denmark and then they have the real meetings that break away and
[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:17.840]  this has come out in their minutes that have come out of the national archives
[2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:21.760]  from the 67 and others so we've been able to reverse engineer a
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:24.480]  lot of this but estalon has multiple sources one of
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:28.080]  which we're aware of that is able to get the internal
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:31.520]  minutes i guess from their steering committees that they have meetings three
[2:17:31.520 --> 2:17:35.120]  times a year at least in europe england in the u.s one meeting in the u.s one
[2:17:35.120 --> 2:17:37.520]  meeting in england one meeting in europe it varies
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:40.720]  sometimes where you have the top people pretty much hammering out what the
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:45.280]  agenda is then it sent to the second tier correct me if i'm wrong daniel
[2:17:45.280 --> 2:17:50.560]  to to have any changes parliamentary from what then goes on at the informal
[2:17:50.560 --> 2:17:55.360]  pretty much voting that goes on but big uh newt proliferation
[2:17:55.360 --> 2:17:58.880]  china russia how do you sanctions how to block them
[2:17:58.880 --> 2:18:02.160]  how to cut russia's funding off because they cut them off in europe making their
[2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:06.160]  money they'll just do it with china how does that happen
[2:18:06.160 --> 2:18:11.520]  german nationalism of the lapin movement uh u-kip spreading
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:15.520]  uh the the real tea party movement here that the establishments threatened by
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:19.840]  web takeover and laws that europe may pass
[2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:26.320]  restricting uh illegal nsa surveillance what will that do here uh cyber war
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:29.760]  i guess that's how they plan to attack claim somebody else did it and use that
[2:18:29.760 --> 2:18:33.840]  as the excuse for the takeover the web is their cover term cyber war
[2:18:33.840 --> 2:18:37.680]  obama being doomed how do they flush obama because he can't get the agenda

[2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:59.120]  who might be listening for the first or the second time

[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:13.760]  during three days or three and a half days actually has such tremendous effect
[2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:17.120]  on the world policy and this is something if we have a minute i'd like to explain

[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:14.720]  the mainstream media they own and control is dying
[2:24:14.720 --> 2:24:18.640]  they won't cover it so we do at info wars dot com
[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:21.440]  we've got paul watson on the ground our other reporters get there tomorrow their
[2:24:21.440 --> 2:24:24.880]  flies were delayed uh you've got the floor to break down how big a deal
[2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:28.080]  bill deberg is you know just last week one of the bill deberg group members
[2:24:28.080 --> 2:24:31.280]  we covered it last hour with paul watson daniel bragged
[2:24:31.280 --> 2:24:34.800]  that they indeed are the most powerful and are setting up a world government so
[2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:38.480]  we really forced them to try to hide it in plain view daniel estalin
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:41.520]  you know no matter alex where you look government's big business and any other
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:46.160]  institution seeking to exercise power the key to control the secrecy you know
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:48.960]  meetings such as uh organization for economic
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:52.240]  cooperation development g eight or we should say g seven
[2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:56.240]  russia's no longer member world trade organization world economic forum
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:01.040]  central banks european union council of ministers european commissioners european
[2:25:01.040 --> 2:25:06.000]  union summits government cabinet meetings numerous think tanks foundations
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.280]  you know they're always conducted behind closed doors and the only possible
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:14.080]  reason for this is that they you know the the powerful people don't want us to
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:17.840]  know what they're discussing now and of course beyond this common reluctance
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:22.160]  to actually reveal the proceedings of meetings the secrecy principle extends to
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:26.000]  the forums and meetings themselves by and large we don't even know most of these
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:29.040]  meetings take place you know you mentioned jim tucker earlier
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:32.960]  well he's been doing it you know god bless his soul for since the 19 later
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:36.880]  in 1970s i believe and before that it was
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:41.360]  uh the uh um the the publication he was working for before i can't remember
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:45.120]  spotlight you know they were covering that you know i mean and then i joined in
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:48.400]  1995 and needless to say when i found out that this
[2:25:48.400 --> 2:25:52.400]  organization called the builder something or other you know back in 1992 when i
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:56.880]  heard it from someone who actually had something to do with it i laughed in his
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:58.720]  face because i thought this is impossible
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:02.640]  well needless to say it is possible because again by and large
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:06.480]  we the people don't even know most of these meetings actually take place
[2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:10.640]  you have the world economic forum in davos in january late january february
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:13.520]  you have the builderberg and g7 meetings april may
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:16.720]  you have the international monetary fund world bank annual conference in
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:19.600]  september and then you have the trilateral commission
[2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:23.120]  meetings you know three times a year you know one meeting
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:26.800]  in january of february takes place for the americas then you have
[2:26:26.800 --> 2:26:30.240]  april may uh or march april you know for europe and then
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:33.520]  september october you have uh is the trilateral commission asia takes place
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:36.800]  and you have the annual meeting cancel foreign relations they have there
[2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:41.200]  you know uh quarterly seminars you know it's a kind of invisible
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:45.360]  international consensus emerges and it carried over for one meeting to the
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:48.640]  next but no one is really leading and that's something that people have to
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:51.440]  understand you know um builderberg is not some
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:54.880]  kind of a wacky conspiracy we have these you know four old geysers
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:58.000]  sitting in a dark room you know underground holding hands staring at a
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.200]  crystal ball planting the world's domination pressing buttons
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:05.040]  and making the world go around the world is a very complex place
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:10.000]  no one is really leading this meeting it works on the concept of consensus and
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:14.160]  this consensus becomes the background for example
[2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:19.120]  for the ge8 or g7 economic communicates it becomes what you know
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:23.600]  informs the international monetary fund what it imposes an adjustment program
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:27.040]  on countries in the third world and it also becomes what the united states
[2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:30.320]  president proposes to congress and needless to say
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:33.600]  it very much front and center for european elections
[2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:37.040]  for the european key talking points you know for the agenda items
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:41.280]  which then you know are passed on to national governments across europe
[2:27:41.280 --> 2:27:44.720]  and this is how it works it's done through consensus
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:48.080]  and again you don't need to control every element of every corporation you
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:51.280]  just need to control key levers of power which is why
[2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:54.800]  the people who attend builder conferences are the movers and shakers of the
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:58.880]  world politics and economy you have all the sitting presidents of european
[2:27:58.880 --> 2:28:02.480]  nations and canada usually attend as i said sitting president united states
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:06.080]  never comes to these meetings but he's well represented by his minions
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:09.200]  you have you know key 50 60 ceo's of the world's
[2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:12.560]  most powerful corporations from the western world
[2:28:12.560 --> 2:28:15.840]  you know we're talking about amazon we're talking about
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:19.600]  corporations such as apple microsoft
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:24.080]  the glaxos smith climb beach him from you know every walk of life is ibn
[2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:28.240]  needless to say top corporate leaders are there you're talking about key
[2:28:28.240 --> 2:28:31.760]  members of the world press new york times
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:37.200]  washington polls the economist cnn they're they're all there limon from
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:40.960]  france a group of priests are from spain you have
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:44.080]  financial times is there all of these individuals they attend
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:47.680]  on the condition that what is said is not reported in the mainstream press
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:50.480]  because that part of this juggernaut so you have
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:54.080]  you know the key politicians you have key ministers key commissioners
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:57.040]  you have president of the international monetary fund the world bank
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:01.040]  a federal reserve board you have the the chairman of european central bank
[2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:05.120]  so amongst these people again no one tells anybody what to do
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:09.920]  but the consensus reached at these meetings go a long way in defining
[2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:14.640]  and deciding world policy that's right we come back in the long
[2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:17.120]  segment i'm going to break down some of the history of it and then what's
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:21.200]  going forward how they try to plan to block
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:24.800]  nationalist movements i know they see as the main threat with daniel uslin
[2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:28.640]  and i'm going to add an augment what you've just said i totally agree with
[2:29:28.640 --> 2:29:34.960]  that it's a consensus synergy where you're invited because you already agree
[2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:38.720]  on the global governance world view to be run by autocrats
[2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:43.600]  in corporations so we're going to talk about that on the other side
[2:29:43.600 --> 2:29:46.880]  there's a consensus because all they're doing is fine-tuning
[2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:52.720]  a program launched a hundred years ago we're on the march the empires on the

[2:32:07.680 --> 2:32:11.680]  but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have
[2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:15.440]  two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and
[2:32:15.440 --> 2:32:19.920]  most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within
[2:32:19.920 --> 2:32:23.840]  their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states

[2:33:21.520 --> 2:33:26.400]  and if they ever figure that out there goes our way of life
[2:33:26.400 --> 2:33:30.320]  it's not about food it's about keeping those ants

[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:47.600]  for your mind back in 2004 already 10 years ago David
[2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:50.960]  Rockefeller wrote memoirs
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:55.280]  and in it he admits the whole plan for a private corporate planetary government
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:59.520]  on page 244 will put the quote up on screen
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:06.160]  he admits that there is a plan to create a world government
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:10.000]  he also prays when mouse a tongue died in the 70s how wonderful mouse a tongue
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:13.520]  was in communism some even believe we're part of a secret cabal working
[2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:17.360]  against the best interest of the united states characterizing my family and me
[2:34:17.360 --> 2:34:20.480]  as internationalists and I'm conspiring with others around the world to build a
[2:34:20.480 --> 2:34:22.960]  more integrated global political and economic structure
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:26.560]  one world if you will if that's the charge I stand guilty and I am proud of
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:30.240]  it the issue is they want to give us
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:35.200]  less for more and they're exempt the new order means you can't have a car
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:38.400]  air conditioning and they're going to suppress new technology that's clean
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:43.280]  that's what obama told africans these are horrible people
[2:34:43.280 --> 2:34:48.080]  that have a very anti-human mission and who openly say
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:51.760]  across the board that it's the end of humanity as we know it and it's a
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:54.480]  foregone conclusion that they're going to merge with machines and that's just
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:57.600]  the way it is in fact we sell the book that's already a
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:00.720]  best-seller daniel estlund's new book that breaks
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:04.000]  all of this down trans evolution the age of human
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:08.800]  deconstruction at infowarstore.com you should get it support them and support
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:12.560]  us and he uses you know basically their own admissions in here
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:18.320]  to break down the plan and and this is foregone conclusion in their writings
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:22.400]  I talk a lot about ecoscience written in 74 by the way how science are
[2:35:22.400 --> 2:35:29.280]  john p holdren along with hall are earlick they talk about that in there
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:33.680]  but now they're doing it I mean it's their world they have
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:38.080]  steered western genius to build the internet but to make it all a control
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:40.480]  grid they have woven together all the different
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:44.160]  corporate systems to build the ultimate team to bring this in
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:49.200]  so that they and their progeny gained the golden fields where mortals become
[2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:54.160]  immortal of elysium now again I'm I'm I'm not
[2:35:54.160 --> 2:35:59.840]  quoting from the new movie elysium I'm quoting from what elysium is in greek
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:04.960]  culture and in greek religion ancient greek religion
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:09.760]  the globals follow plato they believe that they are ascending
[2:36:09.760 --> 2:36:12.960]  and I want you to talk about their real agenda daniel and if you agree with what
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:16.400]  I just said and is there any way to stop these people at this time because their
[2:36:16.400 --> 2:36:20.080]  agenda is behind schedule in some ways
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:25.360]  um it's uh it's a very interesting point I was listening to what you're
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:28.960]  saying alex before the break you talked about you know the
[2:36:28.960 --> 2:36:31.520]  whole idea of of countries nation states
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:34.400]  as opposed to you know the span global dictatorship which is basically what
[2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:38.160]  they're creating um and they call it one world company limited
[2:36:38.160 --> 2:36:41.040]  corporations with a lot more power than any government on the planet
[2:36:41.040 --> 2:36:46.640]  and this go back goes back to 1968 to the building meeting in montreblanc
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:50.560]  Quebec canada where george wall and the secretary for economic affairs
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:55.040]  with the jfk and linden johnson talked about this as one of the key
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:59.440]  discussion points at that conference almost 45 years ago more than 45 years
[2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:04.400]  ago and today that we're seeing the their plans for this
[2:37:04.400 --> 2:37:08.880]  pan world company limited work corporations have a lot more power than
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:12.320]  than sitting president sitting prime ministers is becoming reality and it's
[2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:16.000]  it's a scary thing if you actually realize that they propose this as an
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:19.520]  objective 45 years ago now the whole point of
[2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:25.360]  nay national system on nation states as opposed to uh the pan world system
[2:37:25.360 --> 2:37:29.360]  obviously has to do with uh with the way they understand how money works
[2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:34.000]  now the world today is run by monetary systems not by national credit systems
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:37.280]  and if you're smart you don't want to monitor systems around the world you
[2:37:37.280 --> 2:37:41.360]  want a sovereign nation state to have their own credit system
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:44.720]  which is the system of their currency above all
[2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:48.320]  it's the possibility of productive non-inflationary credit
[2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:52.960]  created by the state which is firmly stated in the united states constitution
[2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:57.600]  and needed to say was excluded by the mastridge treaty
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:02.480]  as a method of determining of economic and financial policy
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:06.080]  now in europe this cannot be done because in europe
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:09.600]  governments are subject to control by private banking interests called
[2:38:09.600 --> 2:38:13.200]  independent banking systems and these institutions have the power
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:17.200]  to regulate governments and to dictate terms to governments
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:20.400]  and you think about you know this institution within the european
[2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:24.080]  and if it's called the european central bank what it tries to function like
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:27.920]  european independent central bank which has no government there's no
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:30.560]  government there's no nation it's a group of
[2:38:30.560 --> 2:38:35.120]  nations run by private bank and it's insanity to belong to this group which
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:39.600]  is something that a lot of people millions of people tens of
[2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:42.640]  millions of people across europe are beginning to realize
[2:38:42.640 --> 2:38:46.400]  it is insane to belong to the european union it is insane to belong
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:50.080]  to anything other than nation states this supposed
[2:38:50.080 --> 2:38:56.160]  independence of the central bank is the decisive control mechanism for private
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:38:59.040]  financial interests which historically in europe been
[2:38:59.040 --> 2:39:03.520]  installed as an authoritative instrument against an economic policy
[2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:07.120]  of sovereign governments oriented towards the general
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:10.480]  welfare and you know european banking it's a
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:13.440]  remnant of a feudal society in which private interests
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:17.360]  are still fight by the ancient venetian cartels you have talked about this before
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:20.960]  venetian black nobility of the lombard league which went down on
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:24.480]  dark age in the 14th century and this is something that these people have tried
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:27.920]  to resuscitate so many times over and again they're
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:32.000]  destroying or trying to destroy every nation state in the world countries
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:36.080]  and create this bad world economic order which they want to call
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:40.320]  world company limited at the expense of nation states at the expense of
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:46.640]  independent countries and peoples of nations
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:52.400]  daniel obviously they didn't want this exposed
[2:39:52.400 --> 2:39:56.800]  and there's famous quotes we'll put one on screen of david rockefeller
[2:39:56.800 --> 2:40:00.960]  uh thanking mainstream media at a trilateral commission meeting
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:06.880]  that's minutes were made public in 2004 we are grateful the washington post the
[2:40:06.880 --> 2:40:10.720]  new york times time magazine and other great publications whose directors have
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:13.280]  attended our meetings and respected their promise of
[2:40:13.280 --> 2:40:17.200]  discretion for almost 40 years it would have been impossible for us
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:21.840]  to develop our plan for the world see it's their plan
[2:40:21.840 --> 2:40:25.440]  and we're not in it folks it would have been impossible for us to develop
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:29.680]  our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:33.360]  during those years but the world is now much more sophisticated and prepared to
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:37.120]  march towards a world government the super national
[2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:41.440]  sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:45.360]  to the national auto determination practice in past centuries
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.040]  trilateral commission meeting addressed in 1991 to get it and come out to the
[2:40:49.040 --> 2:40:54.400]  mid 2000s but the whole point is these guys openly talk like this now
[2:40:54.400 --> 2:40:58.800]  and and my issue is any elite that wants common core taught
[2:40:58.800 --> 2:41:03.520]  where two plus two equals five is a very evil elite i mean they want us to come
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:07.520]  down they want us in a neo feudalistic area and
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:10.320]  people need to know this is the big threats let me ask you this i want you
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:13.440]  to comment on what i just said if you agree or disagree
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:19.840]  but you said in 2007 2006 we put in a film in 2007 that they would
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:24.000]  implode in uh in two years uh the housing market
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.280]  and all the rest of this and that indeed happened and you had that from your
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:30.240]  source i mean they want to hurt people they want to make us poor
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:34.240]  i think people you realize that they they want us poor to control us it's
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:37.600]  neo feudalism correct absolutely and you know one of the
[2:41:37.600 --> 2:41:41.120]  actually one of the things i was i was joining down as uh
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:44.400]  as we're in the last break is something else which i know they're going to be
[2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:49.120]  talking about although i don't have it as a as a as an item a discussion item on
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:52.800]  the agenda is you know the derivatives bubble the global derivatives bubble
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:58.240]  today's 20 bigger but it was just before the last financial
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:03.600]  economic crash which we suffered in 2008 and it's important because as you said
[2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:07.120]  you know the whole thing of the industrialization zero growth
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:10.960]  demand destruction you need to destroy demand if you want to reduce the world's
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:14.480]  population progress and development is directly
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:17.920]  proportional to population density so if we have progress we have technological
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:20.720]  development we're going to have more people
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:24.240]  you need to have progress and development especially the technology
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:27.520]  to support you know the seven billion people we have on the planet today if
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:30.000]  you don't have that there's gonna go a point
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:33.040]  where you're gonna have a collapse and a breakdown of the population
[2:42:33.040 --> 2:42:37.040]  and a great example of this deindustrialization today is detroit
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:40.320]  you know this is what you know this is their a poster child
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:44.240]  for the entire world so the fact is that a derivatives bubble today
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:48.240]  is bigger than it has ever been before and it could explode at any point
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:52.320]  i want to very quickly if we have about a minute to explain to people
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:57.200]  how this you know derivative bubble works and why it's being actually pushed
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:43:01.360]  by the elite to self-destruct
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:05.920]  yes sir please break it down we have an article up on info wars dot com today
[2:43:05.920 --> 2:43:11.120]  uh by zero hedge breaking down that it's it's reached an all-time mega high
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:15.600]  since 2008 you know once you make the decision to create a bubble any bubble
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:19.760]  basically it becomes a pyramid scheme so you're going to
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:23.840]  really dealing the financial games from the real economy which you have to do
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:28.240]  if you're killing the real economy but uh you want to build up the speculative
[2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:32.480]  bubble you have to you know divorce it from reality and derivatives
[2:43:32.480 --> 2:43:36.000]  is a great way to do that it's like creating a game casino table
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:39.280]  and derivatives are side bets on the movements of various things
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:43.040]  like bonds for example the value of bonds interest rates currency rates
[2:43:43.040 --> 2:43:47.520]  so you speculate on these things and you can better know how the speculation is
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:51.200]  going to go so basically you pile derivatives on top of derivatives on
[2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:55.200]  top of derivatives and a good example of that is of course the mortgage market
[2:43:55.200 --> 2:43:58.320]  which everyone is is now very familiar with
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:02.800]  and which had mortgages which were used you know to back derivatives at least
[2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:07.120]  theoretically back them but the notion value of derivatives the dollar
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:11.040]  amount of the derivatives that were created were much more than the value
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:14.160]  of the mortgages so you use the mortgages as a fuel
[2:44:14.160 --> 2:44:17.760]  to fuel these derivative machines which then leveraged it
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.160]  we don't know how many times over and then ultimately this whole thing blew
[2:44:22.160 --> 2:44:25.760]  up completely and you know this whole global system blew up
[2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:29.600]  you know blew out with it and that was back in 2007 as you said
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:33.680]  we've talked about this uh in in Ottawa when you were
[2:44:33.680 --> 2:44:37.120]  working on your documentary when we met at the
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:42.800]  builder conference in in canada autobahn 2006 and needless to say 2007 my words
[2:44:42.800 --> 2:44:46.560]  were prophetic the whole thing just exploded and needless to say
[2:44:46.560 --> 2:44:50.000]  is going to explode again because the idea is to destroy the world economy on
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:53.360]  purpose and the people who think that that can't be the case because needless
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:55.760]  to say if they do that they will suffer as well
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:44:58.720]  they will not suffer they already control the entire planet
[2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:02.880]  what they need to do is reduce the world's population and the way to do that
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:08.080]  is to reduce wealth real wealth okay real economy and that's how you you know
[2:45:08.080 --> 2:45:11.840]  that's why you would deindustrialize the economy that's why you deindustrialize
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:15.040]  the world that's where the terminology zero growth comes in
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:18.480]  and if people are interested you can google the terminology zero growth and
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:22.960]  you'll be surprised how often these words appear on the front pages of the
[2:45:22.960 --> 2:45:26.160]  world's leading periodicals it's not there because somebody
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:29.040]  made a boo boo it's there because they want you to know
[2:45:29.040 --> 2:45:33.920]  subliminally that they're doing this on purpose
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:38.400]  well that's right and under agenda 21 and so many other public statements
[2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:43.040]  under cloward and piven you name it they admit they want to make us poor
[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:46.720]  so that only government controls through corporations
[2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:50.800]  uh the jobs you can get they call it privatization it's really the
[2:45:50.800 --> 2:45:55.280]  the opposite and then they can pick the winners and losers
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:59.520]  and they are exempt from the regulations that they put on transportation law
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:04.160]  enforcement agriculture uh banking manufacturing construction
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:08.640]  education immigration military it's only a two-tiered system that allows all
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:13.120]  this to happen and that's why they promote racial
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:17.120]  division and all this and and political correctness is they need to divide all
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:20.800]  of us while they're busy really being the ultimate
[2:46:20.800 --> 2:46:23.760]  discriminatory group
[2:46:23.760 --> 2:46:28.800]  absolutely alex that's you know that's it's you explain it very well in uh
[2:46:28.800 --> 2:46:33.360]  in endgame very very well it's if you if people haven't uh if you haven't seen
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:38.240]  the film make sure you uh you get a hands-on copy of alex's
[2:46:38.240 --> 2:46:42.240]  film endgame it's an amazing film i i think it's like three hours long
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:45.680]  is it not alex or something yeah sure it's it's it's it's really about three
[2:46:45.680 --> 2:46:49.360]  films in one we just call it endgame it's it's an amazing
[2:46:49.360 --> 2:46:53.680]  competing of of of you know of exactly how this whole thing is being put
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:56.640]  together by who we have some amazing you know documentary
[2:46:56.640 --> 2:46:59.840]  images and footage and i don't know where you got some of the
[2:46:59.840 --> 2:47:04.240]  photographs and uh and film footage but boy i tell you we got it from you and
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:07.520]  you did a great job some stuff there which you know i certainly didn't give
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:09.840]  you but uh oh yeah full footage from you know
[2:47:09.840 --> 2:47:13.920]  from the early part of the century and uh boy an amazing film you need to see it
[2:47:13.920 --> 2:47:17.200]  if you haven't seen it yet well i'll tell you i don't know how you do it
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:21.040]  whenever we'll be there with the telephoto lens you'll go that's
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:24.400]  that's such as such that's such as such and then it always turns out to be
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:29.120]  accurate um how important is it the people that
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:32.400]  that are going to be there who won't be on the list
[2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:36.960]  um you know i tell you that uh since uh you know uh
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:42.560]  my you know jim has done amazing work on on this on uh uncovering you know uh
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:46.400]  bill deberg and their influence but you know since my book came out the true
[2:47:46.400 --> 2:47:49.680]  story of the bill deberg group which you know you sold and thank you so much for
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:54.480]  promoting my book on your site and you know and in in your shows but uh
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:58.240]  it's got to the point right now where hiding you know the existence of bill
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:01.920]  deberg has become silly it doesn't make any sense which is one of the reasons
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:05.520]  you know they you know they they decided the bill deberg decided
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:09.120]  to actually put up their own webpage they say you know if somebody's gonna talk
[2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:12.000]  about us we might as well do it ourselves you know they control the
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:15.920]  information most of it is fairly accurate and most of the people attend
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:19.600]  you know are there and occasionally someone might not be on the list
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:22.960]  but i tell you about you know for the exception of one or two people
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:27.280]  most of them are on the list of the attendees what is important
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:32.000]  is to understand again that this is real that the people who who are there
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:35.120]  are important although again bill deberg is is not the you know
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:39.040]  apex of any pyramid you know it's more of a conveyor belt the real decision
[2:48:39.040 --> 2:48:42.000]  making is not an even higher levels than bill deberg or tri-lateral
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:45.920]  commissure meetings you know council for relations but it's an important element
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:49.440]  of the insurance a major coordinating operation as you said conveyor
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:52.400]  belting all the groups and in fact we've confirmed that some of the bill deberg
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:56.240]  steering meetings will be held privately right after the official
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:49:00.080]  trilateral meeting so as you said they kind of nest together i think you use
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:04.080]  the term russian dolls exactly i mean i'm talking about matryoshkas
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:08.720]  obviously you know but the point is you know it's uh bill deberg has
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:12.800]  they you know they've always enjoyed uh you know their secrecy or their
[2:49:12.800 --> 2:49:16.320]  privacy no but uh it's got another point where you
[2:49:16.320 --> 2:49:19.520]  know they they can't hide any longer what is important to understand again
[2:49:19.520 --> 2:49:23.040]  a bit of a background that bill deberg today is
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:26.880]  a bit less important than it was 40 50 years ago just because of the people
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:29.920]  who attend again you cannot compare the initial
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:33.600]  original bill deberg attendees from you know 1950s and 1960s
[2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:36.800]  these are the people you know who were born before the uh you know the the end
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:40.000]  of the 19th century who went for the first world war you know went through
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:43.040]  the second world war a lot of them were a self-made you know man
[2:49:43.040 --> 2:49:46.240]  and you know they built empires out of nothing such as you talk about the
[2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:49.760]  Rockefellers for example and so these people you know they were steeped in
[2:49:49.760 --> 2:49:52.560]  you know you know world politics at a level which
[2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:57.440]  today simply is just not feasible and uh but you know it was a very important
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:01.200]  element of the oligarchal structures of the cold war period
[2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:05.360]  and it was important because what it meant was that it was a vehicle bill deberg
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:08.960]  meetings through which private financier oligarchal interests
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:13.200]  were able to impose their policies on what is nominally sovereign governments
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:16.880]  now what is interesting about the origins of bill deberg
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:20.880]  is that uh the biggest scandal part of it was that it was heavily very heavily
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:23.920]  populated by people who come out of the world war two
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:27.920]  Nazi apparatus that's right who are basically cleaned up and dusted off
[2:50:27.920 --> 2:50:31.600]  but you know people such as prince bernard who was you know the face and
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:35.360]  who had giant hidden troves of the raw blued of europe i want to
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:37.520]  ask you about that is all you've written extensively
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:41.360]  about that about all the art and the gold i mean just tens of trillions of

[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:21.760]  i don't remember exactly what i was asking to break down i get so i think you mentioned
[2:55:21.760 --> 2:55:28.080]  golden lily operation which went down the you know the gold operation in the second world war
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:32.240]  by the nazi that's right the missing nazi loot and all the the artwork and all the rest of it
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:36.000]  that's right because you see a big nazi contingent with bill berg please continue
[2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:40.960]  there's not again you know the the two individuals the key individuals who are members of the
[2:55:40.960 --> 2:55:47.200]  bill berg uh right from the beginning uh prince bernard one of the founders ss carrying card member
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:51.520]  and also walter hollstein who was uh the first president of the european commission and the man
[2:55:51.520 --> 2:55:59.120]  the lawyer nazi lawyer who uh who's uh writings uh justified or convinced hitler that he had the
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:04.720]  justification necessary to create the the concentration camps uh all across europe so these
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:09.120]  are the two individuals who are very very much involved in bill berg from the very very beginning
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:12.960]  and that's something that bill berg has tried to hide and if you look at some of the individuals
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:20.720]  which you have uh today in the key positions such as uh chroma romp and rosso schultz the uh
[2:56:20.720 --> 2:56:26.720]  the outgoing uh president of commission uh these are the individuals who are very much
[2:56:26.720 --> 2:56:33.760]  in the same vein as uh as the early walter hollstein's and prince bernards but uh it's uh you know
[2:56:34.640 --> 2:56:38.720]  the the whole point of of a gold newly operation very interesting you know we're talking about
[2:56:39.600 --> 2:56:43.600]  if we believe the actual numbers there's 140 000 metric tons of gold in the world
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:47.440]  where there's in fact there's at least a million and a half metric tons of gold
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:52.800]  as a result of stolen loot by the japanese and uh and uh at the germans in the second world where
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:58.640]  now this information can ever came out that gold is as worthy as as a common rock you find on the
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:03.120]  street the entire world's financial markets will collapse onto itself and that's one of the reasons
[2:57:03.120 --> 2:57:09.840]  why most of this loot is still hidden in the uh in the jungles of the philippines malaysian indonesia
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:17.040]  and uh actually the whole point of this independent uh uh bank back in the second bill berg conference
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:22.240]  in 1955 it was discussed in the time on socarna was the president of indonesia was actually going
[2:57:22.240 --> 2:57:28.960]  to use that stolen loot which he knew her son with was as the backdrop uh to create a non-aligned
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:33.360]  bank which was actually going to be the key competition to the western banks and he was to
[2:57:33.360 --> 2:57:39.840]  say the c a took socarna 10 years later in the mid 1960s and one of the key reasons they eliminated
[2:57:39.840 --> 2:57:44.880]  was specifically because of bill de berg's concerns for what would happen to the world economy and
[2:57:44.880 --> 2:57:50.640]  how europe and the united states would lose control of the world financial power if socarna
[2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:55.440]  actually got his non-aligned bank up and running and he could easily have done it because he had
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:58:00.640]  well the money as a result of all this stolen you know trillions and gazillions of trillions
[2:58:00.640 --> 2:58:05.760]  of dollars worth of gold stolen by the japanese and the germans that's right second world war

[3:00:45.600 --> 3:00:52.880]  and internal sources confirmed that both candidates did attend at least one meeting inside the conference
[3:00:55.120 --> 3:01:01.760]  while the bill deberg group was 100 successful in 2008 at keeping their name out of the mainstream
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:09.360]  media they did not fare as well when it came to the exploding independent press during the entire
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:15.200]  two-day event anti-new world order protesters and alternative media encircled the hotel

[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:03.360]  barack obama was the elite's puppet of choice the national media claimed that during the weekend
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:08.960]  the bill deberg group was scheduled to meet that obama had speaking engagements set for chicago
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:16.080]  in the midwest we knew better in a classic baton switch the obama campaign told the press corps
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:22.560]  to get on obama's campaign plane and that obama would join them on the flight to chicago campaign
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:29.120]  staff then slammed the door shut the fawning press had been shanghide as obama's campaign
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:56.400]  aircraft lifted off without obama so we kidnapped you set up these meetings they're being they're

[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:23.760]  initially it was believed that the secret meeting took place at clinton's washington dc home
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:29.120]  obama spokesman denied that but won't confirm where the former rivals met he also declined to
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:35.120]  comment on their topics of discussion for a day and a half the mainstream media engaged in a wild
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:41.360]  goose chase trying to find out where hillary and obama had gone three cover stories later the
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:48.160]  corporate press had to admit they had no idea where the two candidates had gone and of this day
[3:03:48.160 --> 3:03:54.880]  clinton and obama aren't talking plenty of sources knew about this meeting uh told us and others
[3:03:54.880 --> 3:04:00.400]  that it was at hillary clinton's house but clearly it wasn't the builder group sits at
