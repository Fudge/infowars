[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.880]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:27.520]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex now alex is
[00:27.520 --> 00:30.480]  going to be with us in the second hour and we've got a lot to talk about
[00:30.480 --> 00:35.520]  especially about the tsa you know it was really the tsa is where i found alex
[00:35.520 --> 00:41.200]  believe it or not um it was his tireless pursuit of what they're doing which is
[00:41.840 --> 00:45.760]  something that he's basically followed by himself and uh so we're going to be talking
[00:45.760 --> 00:52.400]  about now the latest territorial overreach of the tsa when alex joins us in the second hour
[00:52.400 --> 00:56.080]  and the third hour we're going to be joined by lord montan and we're going to talk about global
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.600]  warming and we're going to talk about junk science and if that's not a topic that interested
[01:01.600 --> 01:06.400]  interests you let me talk to you about how much that's going to cost you if these carbon
[01:06.400 --> 01:15.200]  taxes that are being proposed go through it's estimated to be 25 000 a year per person that's
[01:15.200 --> 01:22.160]  a year each year that's the size of the tarp bailout but that's being done every year if that
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.240]  goes through and who's that money going to be paid to well it's going to be paid to some
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.720]  private corporations that uh algore and other uh elitists have created uh you're going to pay
[01:32.720 --> 01:37.760]  an indulgence to them for every kind of activity that you do because every kind of activity that
[01:37.760 --> 01:43.360]  you engage in is going to have some kind of a carbon print and so you're going to have to pay
[01:43.360 --> 01:49.360]  them to do that why should you pay them well it's the same logic that exists with the federal
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.920]  reserve that was created about a hundred years ago it's anniversaries coming up this december
[01:54.960 --> 02:00.800]  why should we have to pay the federal reserve for them printing money but we do pay that private
[02:00.800 --> 02:07.120]  corporation and now with this carbon tax scheme this is something that is far greater than any
[02:07.120 --> 02:11.440]  bankster scheme has ever been before they're putting this on steroids are going global with it
[02:11.440 --> 02:18.000]  and they're going to put a tarp bailout every year on you if you don't stop it and it also has
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  implications in terms of not just money that you directly pay but things that you don't
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.160]  necessarily see right away you wonder why your utility bill is going up doubling tripling in
[02:28.160 --> 02:32.240]  many cases well it's because they're shutting down power plants why are they shutting down power
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.240]  plants because of the junk science of global warming so we're going to talk to lord montan about
[02:38.240 --> 02:43.200]  that in the third hour now the breaking news today of course that everybody is talking about is
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.120]  detroit going bankrupt now this is something that has been there for quite some time this has been
[02:49.120 --> 02:57.280]  on the horizon but actually it just came out yesterday officially that they're going bankrupt
[02:57.840 --> 03:02.480]  now this is something that we were told would never happen we've got a clip ready i want
[03:02.480 --> 03:08.320]  you to hear it from the horse's mouth but we refuse to throw in the towel and do nothing
[03:08.320 --> 03:14.560]  we refuse to let detroit go bankrupt i bet on american workers and american ingenuity
[03:14.560 --> 03:21.600]  and three years later that bet is paying off in a big way another success another pledge
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.560]  of course they also pledge to uphold and respect the constitution right we haven't seen much done
[03:26.560 --> 03:31.920]  about that either but what is happening to detroit is something that's been going on for a long time
[03:31.920 --> 03:39.600]  here's uh from prisonplanet.com here's 11 depressing stats about detroit their population has plunged
[03:39.600 --> 03:48.800]  63 percent since 1950 down 26 percent just since 2000 even as the population fell that 63 percent
[03:48.800 --> 03:55.600]  since 1950 however the city workforce only went down by 40 percent because you can't fire union
[03:55.600 --> 04:03.280]  workers detroit now has the highest violent crime rate of any large city so you look at these these
[04:03.280 --> 04:09.040]  problems just the fact that you've got an over heavy city government look at what's happening
[04:09.040 --> 04:14.160]  with the federal government even as the rest of the country is suffering under an economic
[04:14.160 --> 04:20.240]  malaise under a recession under depression we have federal government employees exploding
[04:20.240 --> 04:25.600]  same thing that's happening with uh happened with detroit although uh you know this this major
[04:25.600 --> 04:30.480]  imbalance between federal employees between government workers and the people who support
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.440]  them and then look at what happens with violent crime if we see the same kind of gun control
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.840]  that they have in the northern states in detroit and elsewhere we're going to see that kind of
[04:39.840 --> 04:44.240]  crime rate explode to the rest of the country detroit is a weather vane for the rest of the
[04:44.240 --> 04:49.120]  country well stay tuned we'll be right back we've got some exciting news we've got alex jones coming

[08:15.440 --> 08:19.040]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex
[08:19.040 --> 08:22.160]  now alex is going to be joining us in the second hour we're going to be talking about
[08:22.160 --> 08:28.320]  some new encroachments from the tsa just unbelievable it never stops and it will never
[08:28.320 --> 08:34.160]  stop until we stand up in mass and oppose it but alex has talked quite a bit about the
[08:34.160 --> 08:40.880]  trevon martin uh george zemerman case we have black leaders who are now standing up and speaking
[08:40.880 --> 08:48.560]  out we've had bill cosby say this is not about race and we have this from charles barkley there are
[08:48.560 --> 08:54.080]  very few people who have a pure heart when it comes to race uh racism is wrong in any shape
[08:54.080 --> 08:57.680]  form there's a lot of black people are racist too i think sometimes when people talk about
[08:57.680 --> 09:01.680]  race they act like only white people are racist there are a lot of black people who are racist
[09:01.680 --> 09:05.600]  and i don't like when it gets out there in the media because i don't think the media has clean
[09:05.600 --> 09:10.560]  hands i think you're right yeah i'm glad you made that i don't think the media has clean hands
[09:10.560 --> 09:16.240]  and like i said i feel sorry that young kid got killed but just judging by the evidence i don't
[09:16.240 --> 09:19.520]  think that god should have went to jail for the rest of his life but something happened bad that
[09:19.520 --> 09:23.360]  night obviously yeah i like what one of the jurors said they said they both should have walked away
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.480]  yes um and if there's a shadow of a doubt yeah let's let's pull to that he goes on to say
[09:28.480 --> 09:35.600]  he says zimmerman was wrong to pursue he was racial profiling and he said uh i think trevon
[09:35.600 --> 09:39.360]  martin god rest his soul i think he did flip the switch and started beating the hell uh the
[09:39.360 --> 09:44.960]  h out of mr zimmerman it was just a bad situation like i said the main thing i feel bad for it gives
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.400]  every black and white person who is a racist a platform to vent their ignorance he said he
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.760]  watched the trial closely he said a lot of people have an agenda and i think that's a key point
[09:55.760 --> 10:01.600]  i think he was right i think there was some profiling going on there but it's very much like
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.160]  you have a uh let's say you have a husband and wife and the wife is being passive aggressive
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.920]  with a husband really pushing all of his buttons and at some point he turns around and starts to
[10:11.920 --> 10:19.360]  attack her at that point she has a right to defend herself so even though zimmerman may have been
[10:19.360 --> 10:26.560]  doing something that we all despise that was racial profiling once he is attacked by trevon martin
[10:27.200 --> 10:32.560]  as wrong as he may have been to attack him on that he has a right to defend himself that's why
[10:32.560 --> 10:38.240]  you needed a jury that's why a jury needed to make that kind of nuanced decision that's why it's wrong
[10:38.240 --> 10:43.600]  for the media to convict people just like they're doing with zhokhar zharnaev you know they're
[10:43.600 --> 10:50.080]  convicted him all of the all the uh complaints now about this rolling stones magazine cover are
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.960]  just amazing because they're focusing on the fact that he looks too nice not about the fact
[10:54.960 --> 11:02.320]  that the rolling stones has identified him as the bomber he's not had a trial yet they just
[11:02.320 --> 11:07.920]  had the first arraignment and he said he was not guilty let's uh call him the alleged bomber at the
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.960]  very most but uh getting back to this zimmerman thing we've got like i said black leaders that
[11:12.960 --> 11:17.520]  are speaking out and uh alex is going to be talking to some of them coming up on sunday he's got
[11:17.520 --> 11:23.360]  pastor manning and then on monday he has larry elder and of course we've also talked to larry
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.840]  pinkney what i believe is behind this and i think it's very easy to see that the government has an
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.440]  agenda they don't want you talking about ben gazi they don't want people talking about the irs or
[11:33.440 --> 11:39.040]  they don't want people talking about the nsa spying on everybody it's much easier to pick one case
[11:39.040 --> 11:44.400]  and divide people against each other get people all worked up so they're talking about that only
[11:44.400 --> 11:49.200]  it's really co intel pro it's what we were talking about with larry pinkney who used to be with the
[11:49.200 --> 11:54.560]  black panthers he's very well aware of how the government infiltrates groups how they divide
[11:54.560 --> 11:58.960]  and conquer you know the black panthers the original black panthers didn't really get to be
[11:58.960 --> 12:04.320]  dangerous until they started pulling in people from all different racial groups at that point
[12:04.320 --> 12:09.600]  the fbi shut them down but of course now we have the new black panthers who put out a ten thousand
[12:09.600 --> 12:16.640]  dollar bounty on the head of zimmerman and nothing is being done about that just as nothing was done
[12:16.640 --> 12:22.560]  by the eric holder justice department when the new black panthers were using intimidation to keep
[12:22.560 --> 12:28.960]  people away from polling places clearly it's a co intel pro operation clearly it suits the agenda
[12:28.960 --> 12:34.960]  of the government and we see now also that this is what it's perhaps about as well as distracting
[12:34.960 --> 12:40.240]  people it's about the second amendment again trying to get that back into the spotlight the
[12:40.240 --> 12:46.560]  justice department has now placed a hold on george zimmerman's gun even though he's been found
[12:47.120 --> 12:52.320]  not guilty and let's understand too this is something we talked about with larry pinkney
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.120]  not guilty doesn't mean that zimmerman is innocent nobody is really innocent and he may have had
[12:57.120 --> 13:02.800]  very impure motives of what happened but he was not guilty of murder is what the jury found and
[13:02.800 --> 13:07.440]  as obama said only thing i've agreed with that he said is that we have to stand by what the jury
[13:07.440 --> 13:11.840]  found but they're using this nevertheless the obama administration is using this to go after
[13:11.840 --> 13:16.160]  guns to go after the second amendment to go after zimmerman's gun specifically so here you have a
[13:16.160 --> 13:21.040]  situation where even though people are putting a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head even though
[13:21.040 --> 13:24.960]  you've got t-shirts being sold with that even though you get a facebook page sold with that
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.920]  not only does the government not go after these people not even talk to these people
[13:29.920 --> 13:36.880]  but now they withhold his gun zimmerman's gun which he is not guilty he is allowed to have
[13:36.880 --> 13:43.680]  that back by florida law but don't expect the florida local officials to give that back to
[13:43.680 --> 13:50.560]  him to stand up for his rights because they've been working on this to basically this kind of a
[13:50.560 --> 13:54.720]  um subversion of justice for quite some time if you look at what happened with the prosecutor's
[13:54.720 --> 14:02.640]  office they actually fired the director of it this last saturday after the verdict was announced
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.160]  they actually fired him and said that it was for withholding evidence well actually he wasn't the
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.520]  one withholding evidence he noticed that they had released about 2,900 pieces of evidence and there
[14:13.520 --> 14:19.840]  was over 4,000 pieces of evidence he started going through the chain of command and as he got the
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.440]  cold shoulder nobody wanted to talk about this he went public with it they suspended him back in may
[14:25.440 --> 14:31.200]  and then when the verdict was announced this last saturday they fired him and incredibly
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.160]  the person from the attorney general's office said that he was the one holding back evidence
[14:37.040 --> 14:40.400]  i don't find that at all to be credible not if he's going up through the chain of command
[14:40.400 --> 14:45.120]  saying all the evidence hasn't been turned over and then we had this revelation from the defense
[14:45.120 --> 14:51.120]  team they said that they had gotten pictures some of the pictures that they got were black and white
[14:51.120 --> 14:55.680]  pictures now why would they be black and white pictures well they don't want the blood on zimberman's
[14:55.680 --> 15:00.160]  head to show right they saw these black and white pictures and they thought wait these are cell phone
[15:00.160 --> 15:06.160]  pictures cell phones don't take black and white pictures so they asked the attorney general they
[15:06.160 --> 15:11.760]  asked the attorney general's office to release the original pictures and that was back in january
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.440]  and they did not get those pictures until the beginning of june and when they did
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.880]  they still were not full color pictures there were kind of some pastel pictures so the prosecution
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.880]  team has an evidence tampering history here and then they not only fire the whistleblower
[15:26.880 --> 15:29.920]  but they say he's not a whistleblower he's the one who is actually holding back evidence
[15:30.640 --> 15:36.560]  not credible at all but i don't believe that the local attorney is going to be standing up for
[15:36.560 --> 15:40.880]  zimberman's rights they didn't stand up for his right to a due process i don't think they're going
[15:40.880 --> 15:47.760]  to stand up for his right to the second amendment as well now some new revelations have come out in
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.720]  the irs scandal there are some congressional hearings that are still going on about that you
[15:52.720 --> 15:57.120]  haven't heard anything about it because everybody's been talking about the zimberman case but uh this
[15:57.120 --> 16:03.120]  is from peggy newton and she said that when the scandal broke two months ago in may the irs leadership
[16:03.120 --> 16:08.960]  in washington claimed that this is all about local Cincinnati people that are off the rails that
[16:08.960 --> 16:13.440]  were going out but now we have some testimony from some of those lower people who's saying that
[16:14.000 --> 16:20.080]  they were actually getting orders from higher up now this is very significant because if you remember
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.640]  the articles of impeachment against richard nixon were originally one of the articles
[16:24.640 --> 16:30.960]  who was about using the irs against political enemies and that's exactly the same thing that the
[16:30.960 --> 16:37.120]  obama administration is doing except for one difference the breadth and the scope and the depth
[16:37.120 --> 16:43.520]  of it is far greater than anything nixon ever did but uh it's going to be interesting as you see
[16:43.520 --> 16:47.600]  these people pitted against each other now that you know these people who were thrown under the
[16:47.600 --> 16:54.720]  bus by the higher ups are now saying are now testifying to congress uh michael sito head of
[16:54.720 --> 17:00.560]  the investigation unit spoke to investigators and told them that lois learner made an unusual
[17:00.560 --> 17:05.120]  decision that she's the one in washington she's the one who basically threw these other people
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.640]  under the bus the higher up she said tea party applications would undergo additional scrutiny
[17:10.640 --> 17:15.360]  a multi-layered review so they're specifically targeting their political enemies they were
[17:15.360 --> 17:24.000]  very concerned because people moved en masse against uh they were against the tarp against
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.760]  the bailouts and they started forming these tea party organizations the government was very concerned
[17:29.760 --> 17:34.720]  about that they knew they had to nip that in the bud and one of the ways that they used to stifle
[17:34.720 --> 17:39.920]  political dissent has always been to attack people with the irs and i find it interesting this article
[17:39.920 --> 17:46.880]  from russia where even the russians are afraid of the masses when they get together and uh
[17:46.880 --> 17:53.040]  demonstrate they had a russian opposition leader has now been freed on bail as protests
[17:53.040 --> 17:59.840]  rattled the kremlin this is from reuters and as we talked about yesterday when the east germans
[17:59.840 --> 18:06.240]  took back their freedoms from the stasi they did it by marching en masse they started in
[18:06.240 --> 18:11.120]  the churches and then they moved to the fences where the guards were shooting people who tried
[18:11.120 --> 18:16.800]  to cross over from east germany to west germany and finally when they came in masses when they
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.720]  moved in the churches from inside the churches to the wall the guards stood down they would not
[18:22.720 --> 18:29.360]  fire on the masses even the stasi fears people that's why it's important for us to do something
[18:29.360 --> 18:34.880]  so why it's important for us to not take these encroachments on our freedoms that we see from
[18:34.880 --> 18:41.040]  the nsa from the irs from others it's important for us to not to take those things lying down
[18:41.040 --> 18:46.000]  and i think there's been a real sea change in the last 20 years i know when i was involved
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.720]  heavily with the libertarian party in the early 90s and we were talking about ending the irs
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.920]  and everybody the journalists would just laugh at us of course they probably would still laugh at
[18:55.920 --> 19:01.920]  you but now we have senator ted cruise talking about that and people aren't laughing people are
[19:01.920 --> 19:05.760]  getting behind him we need to get behind him in that effort you know if we can't impeach
[19:06.480 --> 19:11.280]  obama maybe we can get rid of the irs maybe we can offer that to him as kind of a plea bargain
[19:11.280 --> 19:15.760]  okay we won't throw you out you throw out the irs we'll let you stay for a little while longer
[19:15.760 --> 19:21.760]  until the next scandal comes along but uh even in russia even in russia when they get an opposition
[19:21.760 --> 19:27.760]  leader and they arrest him if enough people show up they get scared and so they've released uh this
[19:27.760 --> 19:36.800]  fellow from jail now the cia is back in the news something very similar to operation gladio

[24:17.040 --> 24:22.720]  jones alex will be joining us at the beginning of the next hour we're going to be talking about
[24:22.720 --> 24:29.200]  the tsa and its new outreach we should say but it's not actually an outreach it's an overreach
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.360]  they continue to defy the fourth amendment in new and innovative ways and we're going to be talking
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.080]  about that when alex joins us now just before the break i said we're going to have some news
[24:40.080 --> 24:46.000]  about the cia this is actually a very interesting story this is uh robert selden lady this is
[24:46.000 --> 24:54.400]  reported by the huffington post x cia station chief has been arrested in panama a former cia base
[24:54.400 --> 24:59.120]  chief convicted in the 2003 abduction of a terrorist suspect from natalian street has been
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.920]  detained in panama after italy requested his arrest in one of the most notorious episodes
[25:03.920 --> 25:10.480]  of the u.s program known as extraordinary rendition isn't that a nice euphemism rendition
[25:10.480 --> 25:16.480]  and what that actually means is kidnapping and torture that's what everybody else besides the
[25:16.480 --> 25:23.920]  cia calls it and you know italy has a history of uh standing up to the cia if you're not familiar
[25:23.920 --> 25:29.840]  with the history of operation gladio you should look it up you should google that you should
[25:29.840 --> 25:38.080]  read what the cia and nato did in italy i remember back in the 1970s all the news about
[25:38.080 --> 25:44.240]  communist terrorists and all these attacks that the red brigade was conducting that they kidnapped
[25:44.240 --> 25:50.080]  aldo moro and all these other things those were basically done by nato as a false flag
[25:50.640 --> 25:56.960]  because the communist party and leftist political parties were gaining power in italy so they didn't
[25:56.960 --> 26:02.800]  want that to happen so they started creating false flag terrorist events and uh they got these um
[26:02.800 --> 26:08.320]  that they they just went on a reign of murder throughout italy and the italians called them on
[26:08.320 --> 26:15.120]  it the italians have had trials they have um exposed the information but i want you to also
[26:15.120 --> 26:20.960]  think about this this isn't just something that happens in italy if the cia does it in italy if
[26:20.960 --> 26:26.400]  the american government does it in italy they will do it to americans understand that the declaration
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.600]  of independence says that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain
[26:31.600 --> 26:36.320]  inalienable rights among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it doesn't say
[26:36.320 --> 26:42.640]  american citizens alone enjoy those rights it says all men and when you have a government
[26:42.640 --> 26:48.800]  that is destructive of those rights then that government needs to be altered or abolished why
[26:48.800 --> 26:55.120]  because it is going to destroy those rights of american citizens as well as italian citizens
[26:55.120 --> 26:59.280]  as well as people who are citizens of other countries if they'll do it in a western democracy
[26:59.280 --> 27:06.240]  like italy they'll do it here and that's exactly what the ndaa is about the government has declared
[27:06.240 --> 27:12.400]  its intention to openly violate the constitution which guarantees those god-given rights that are
[27:12.400 --> 27:17.920]  spoken of in the declaration of independence those are rights again that are not just for american
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.880]  citizens and if you have a government that is openly contemptuous of the rights of individuals
[27:22.880 --> 27:29.040]  of other people then it is going to eventually do the same thing to americans we're not going to have
[27:29.040 --> 27:34.560]  any protection because they've already shown that they don't have any respect whatsoever
[27:34.560 --> 27:40.240]  for the constitution or for the rule of law one last quote here from this article from
[27:40.240 --> 27:45.760]  huffington post it says us officials who have thus far evaded any accountability for their role
[27:45.760 --> 27:51.920]  in a global torture program should take today's developments as a warning sign and i would also
[27:51.920 --> 27:59.280]  add so should the cia minions who support this criminal illegitimate government and i'm not
[27:59.280 --> 28:03.840]  the only one who's saying that it is criminal and illegitimate former president jimmy carter
[28:03.840 --> 28:11.360]  said it yesterday we also had former senator from new hampshire gordon humphrey's say it about the
[28:11.360 --> 28:16.880]  nsa and what gordon humphrey said is exactly right the government is now concerned about how
[28:16.880 --> 28:23.440]  do they control these leaks they're not really concerned about how they're going to who they're
[28:23.440 --> 28:27.440]  going to punish for violating the constitution who they're going to punish for spying on every
[28:27.440 --> 28:34.080]  american this is from an article today in roiders the u.s. government is overhauling procedures to
[28:34.080 --> 28:39.120]  tighten access to top secret intelligence in a bid to prevent another mega leak like the one carried
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.760]  out by former spy agency contractor edward snowden see they're concerned about these leaks we've got
[28:43.760 --> 28:49.440]  to stop these leaks they're not concerned about stopping the criminal activity and that's precisely
[28:49.440 --> 28:56.000]  what former senator gordon humphrey's said and again from the we've got people just the previous
[28:56.000 --> 29:03.920]  generation of power brokers and politicians in washington are calling like jimmy carter like
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.200]  gordon humphrey's like paul craig roberts are pointing out that this is a criminal government
[29:09.200 --> 29:16.080]  that has destroyed democracy that has violated their oath of office that is actually illegitimate
[29:16.080 --> 29:22.400]  and these episodes with the cia just underscore that we're going to be right back we're going to

[33:25.280 --> 33:27.680]  on the gcn radio network
[33:35.440 --> 33:40.160]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex and if you remember
[33:40.160 --> 33:44.080]  the beginning of the show we were talking about the news that a lot of people are talking about
[33:44.080 --> 33:50.800]  today and that is the official declaration of bankruptcy from detroit now one of the things
[33:50.800 --> 33:54.880]  that i thought was interesting about that we played the clip of obama saying that uh he was so
[33:54.880 --> 33:58.560]  proud that he was not going to let detroit go bankrupt now of course he was not talking
[33:58.560 --> 34:03.680]  necessarily about the city he was talking about the large corporations that he was going to bail
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.160]  out that he did in fact bail out those same large corporations like general motors that then
[34:08.160 --> 34:16.880]  subsequently moved their plants offshore to china and other places great job there that's exactly
[34:16.880 --> 34:21.440]  what happens but one of the things that i thought was interesting about it that hasn't been widely
[34:21.440 --> 34:27.760]  talked about is the fact that standard and poorest today has now rated their municipal bonds as junk
[34:28.640 --> 34:34.560]  just today the day after they declared bankruptcy didn't see it coming i guess standard and poorest
[34:34.560 --> 34:39.440]  about the only people on the planet that didn't see this coming but uh as our article on info wars
[34:39.440 --> 34:46.080]  from anthony gucciardi points out uh this is a harbinger of things to come at a national level
[34:46.080 --> 34:51.360]  as the economy descends into a debt collapse and that is absolutely true and as we also point out
[34:51.360 --> 34:59.360]  another prison planet article the population of detroit fell by 63 percent at the same time the
[34:59.360 --> 35:04.000]  workforce the city workforce only fell by 40 percent and we've been seeing exactly the same
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.120]  sort of thing happening at the federal government level as the economy is going down we are seeing
[35:09.120 --> 35:16.240]  the government increase the number of employees that is not something that is sustainable we also
[35:16.240 --> 35:22.560]  see that violent crime in detroit has soared as you would expect when the residents are not allowed
[35:22.560 --> 35:27.280]  to defend themselves with guns and you know one of the things if we have the liberals have their
[35:27.280 --> 35:34.640]  way and we go into uh more extensive gun control or uh obama has his way eric holder has his way
[35:34.640 --> 35:40.480]  you're going to need something besides a gun you're going to need uh something to protect you
[35:40.480 --> 35:46.320]  you know there's a lot of drive by shootings in chicago and in uh detroit a lot of people are shot
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.520]  in their homes by the rampant war on drugs another thing that has been put on us by the federal
[35:51.520 --> 35:57.040]  government correctly more correctly described as the war of drugs one way you can do that
[35:57.040 --> 36:03.360]  is get some something defensive some body armor one of our sponsors is infidel body armor that's
[36:03.360 --> 36:10.640]  infidel body armor dot com stops hundreds of rounds from ak-47 m4 30 60 308 and more
[36:11.280 --> 36:17.200]  ceramic armor may stop six rounds but what about the seventh and it has fit sizes from medium to
[36:17.200 --> 36:29.120]  to excel that's 888 608 6605 that's infidel body armor now we've got some calls on the line we're
[36:29.120 --> 36:34.640]  going to uh take some calls here we've got uh the punisher uh what do you want to tell us punisher
[36:34.640 --> 36:39.920]  you got a question or comment first of all i'd like to start out by saying i'd like to give a
[36:39.920 --> 36:45.520]  shout out to all my brothers and sisters listening to us in the nsa thank you for keeping us safe
[36:45.520 --> 36:51.840]  from ourselves um i i would just like to say David thank you for what you do sir um i i just
[36:51.840 --> 36:58.240]  have a small story um i'm um one of the reasons why i'm i'm kind of anonymous on the phone right
[36:58.240 --> 37:04.240]  now is because i'm the you know part of the united states morning call um i i went through uh
[37:04.240 --> 37:09.440]  something strange at u.s customs and border patrol just recently uh with me and my family we took a
[37:09.440 --> 37:15.280]  small trip uh to the islands um just uh off the coast of florida uh went outside the country and
[37:15.280 --> 37:20.400]  that was interesting was that my son was uh randomly selected for additional screening
[37:20.400 --> 37:26.240]  uh we were uh kind of like put aside in a room with three other families now mind you we were in
[37:26.240 --> 37:33.040]  a room with the three families all three families had sons all the uh uh uh uh how old is your how
[37:33.040 --> 37:40.560]  old is your son team 14 14 so we were all uh selected uh for additional screening all the
[37:40.560 --> 37:46.640]  family uh it was one father and uh three uh children uh one of his boys it was another
[37:46.640 --> 37:52.560]  family of uh a couple and two sons and one of their son was selected after we went through
[37:52.560 --> 37:58.080]  the screening process we didn't think we had anything in common however when we were uh all
[37:58.080 --> 38:04.880]  at the flight uh obviously we our flight uh left without us so we were held back at least four hours
[38:04.880 --> 38:11.120]  in that same terminal so we all got to talking and we just all realized that in one way or another
[38:11.120 --> 38:16.320]  we were all in the military some were retired uh the the person who was the father of three
[38:16.320 --> 38:23.040]  children was retired and uh they held us all back they went through our luggage um i actually took
[38:23.040 --> 38:30.160]  took the opportunity to ask the officer uh us border patrol and customs i said um you know why
[38:30.160 --> 38:35.840]  you um stopping my son what's going on i'm just here you know to make sure that you don't violate
[38:35.840 --> 38:41.280]  any of our rights and he said well i hate to bring it to you but outside the united states uh the
[38:41.280 --> 38:47.920]  u.s constitution does not apply huh yeah well you know it doesn't apply inside the united states
[38:47.920 --> 38:53.440]  either right according to them and it doesn't apply within a hundred miles of the border either
[38:53.440 --> 39:00.640]  according to them i mean they have their arbitrary stuff it's just absolutely amazing how they openly
[39:00.640 --> 39:05.200]  now refute the constitution refute the rule of law and one of the things that we were talking
[39:05.200 --> 39:09.840]  about yesterday was the uh stasi and we talked about a pastor who had lived under the stasi and
[39:09.840 --> 39:14.640]  one of the things that he was talking about was how the total surveillance of everybody and the
[39:14.640 --> 39:20.240]  fact that they knew they were under surveillance was a thing that intimidated everyone it was an
[39:20.240 --> 39:25.920]  oppressive thing so but we hear people today who were saying that uh they have nothing to hide
[39:25.920 --> 39:30.400]  they don't care if the government is listening to them they have nothing to hide they don't realize
[39:31.040 --> 39:37.200]  just how oppressive a stasi like the government can be and we have the potential to have something
[39:37.200 --> 39:43.600]  that is far worse than mankind has ever seen because you can meld the surveillance state of
[39:43.600 --> 39:50.640]  the stasi with modern technology and it is going to be one terrible thing to live under if we don't
[39:50.640 --> 39:56.400]  stop it if we don't make them obey the law we got a caller here cletus in california cletus do you
[39:56.400 --> 40:02.640]  have a question i actually wanted to comment on what the last caller said he made a great point to
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.320]  say that if you talk to people you'll learn a lot and you'll find out that you have a lot of things
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.520]  in common uh what i've been doing i live down in southern california soviet southern california
[40:11.520 --> 40:17.920]  and i've been finding out a lot of the military that i talked to are asleep and if you just give
[40:17.920 --> 40:21.600]  them little tidbits of information they wake up immediately they've seen what's going on
[40:22.720 --> 40:29.120]  yeah yeah absolutely so i i have a a short story to let me tell it i spoke to a marine
[40:29.120 --> 40:34.880]  here in uh hinds the beach california and he told me about a british a british sas
[40:34.880 --> 40:42.080]  so i tried to recruit him for false the false flag terrorism here in america really but what
[40:42.080 --> 40:47.200]  type of uh what was the nature of what they were going to have him do they tell you uh they tried
[40:47.200 --> 40:54.880]  to lure him in with uh a little i guess uh they tried to tell him that they could train him to
[40:54.880 --> 41:02.240]  pass lie detector tests and do all these uh elite things and that uh before he wanted to commit to it
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.720]  he would have to watch this movie i think it's called incendiary and what they do is they go around
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.920]  and and they plant bombs and either uh diffuse the actions before it happens or they allow it to go
[41:11.920 --> 41:17.280]  off and then uh use it for political expediency well it's not like they haven't done that before
[41:17.280 --> 41:22.640]  just as we were talking about in the last segment they did that all throughout italy with operation
[41:22.640 --> 41:29.760]  gladio and that's one of the reasons why the italians are so angry about these uh cia people
[41:29.760 --> 41:35.600]  who kidnapped and uh sent to egypt for torture uh this fellow right off the italian streets
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.960]  they're talking about false flag attacks uh there's an excellent article from kurt nimo on today's
[41:40.960 --> 41:46.480]  info wars zochars our naiv's throat wound yet another government lie bites the dust now if
[41:46.480 --> 41:49.840]  you remember yesterday we talked about the picture on the rolling stones cover that everybody's
[41:49.840 --> 41:56.080]  getting upset about the fact that uh he looked too nice on the cover and what i was upset about
[41:56.080 --> 42:02.160]  was the fact that he's no longer the alleged even the alleged bomber but he is the bomber tried and
[42:02.160 --> 42:07.840]  convicted in the media but nobody seemed to have a problem with that but in response to that we had
[42:07.840 --> 42:14.240]  a uh a police sergeant i believe was his rank uh actually went public with some pictures that he
[42:14.240 --> 42:19.920]  had taken because he was upset about the appearance of zochars our naiv so he actually put some pictures
[42:19.920 --> 42:27.040]  out now things in a in a fit of anger now these pictures have pointed out as uh kurt nimo writes
[42:27.040 --> 42:33.760]  that the government was lying to us all along about zochar he said uh we were told by the
[42:33.760 --> 42:39.920]  massachusetts governor initially that zarnav was in quote serious but stable condition and not yet
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.120]  able to communicate and then we were told that he had been trapped in a boat it was thought that
[42:45.120 --> 42:50.880]  the teenager placed a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger in a desperate bid to avoid capture
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.640]  and possible death penalty claimed the british version of the national inquire the mirror
[42:54.640 --> 42:58.480]  reports say the bullet passed through his throat just missing his spinal cord and came out the back
[42:58.480 --> 43:04.240]  of his neck uh and it says uh in the article from kurt nimo the hollywood-esque version dovetailed
[43:04.240 --> 43:09.040]  nicely with the story that the evil brothers zarnaev were in a running gun battle with cops
[43:09.040 --> 43:13.920]  flinging homemade pressure cooker bombs that their brave pursuers as the pair attempted to escape
[43:13.920 --> 43:20.800]  the long arm of the law then the blaze kicked in that's uh glenn beck's publication and they said
[43:20.800 --> 43:26.000]  later that zarnaev is in stable condition but because of wounds to his throat he may never
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.440]  be able to speak again then in may the story changed again it was said that zarnaev didn't
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.360]  have a bullet wound in his throat but was cut by a knife i did see a throat injury to me it looked
[43:37.360 --> 43:41.840]  like more like a knife wound said officer jeff cambell of the massachusetts bay transportation
[43:41.840 --> 43:48.160]  authority transit police swat unit now we have a photo because of this dust up about the rolling
[43:48.160 --> 43:53.040]  stones cover now we have a photo of zarnaev allegedly surrendering taken by the massachusetts
[43:53.040 --> 43:58.720]  state police photographer and the cbs boston reported on thursday that the photographer
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.960]  sergeant shon murphy gave the photos to the boston magazine because he was upset about the rolling
[44:02.960 --> 44:10.640]  stones glamorous cover note the absence of the throat wound in the photo i mean that the whole
[44:10.640 --> 44:18.400]  thing has been manufactured and strung along by the press by the media and um you know it's just
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.200]  shameful what has been done but talking about false flag attacks uh that we just had to uh
[44:23.200 --> 44:28.640]  cover not only the false flag but the false narrative that continually evolves and changes
[44:28.640 --> 44:33.680]  and i think it's also interesting to note that um some people when he made his first appearance
[44:33.680 --> 44:39.040]  of course there's no photography taken at the trial but several people who knew him said that it
[44:39.040 --> 44:44.880]  didn't look very much like him they said that he didn't act like him but most importantly the
[44:45.840 --> 44:51.840]  local i think it was a boston herald uh uh reporter that was on uh video said that um
[44:52.400 --> 44:59.280]  he had a very strong accent when he gave his not guilty plea now somebody put that report
[44:59.280 --> 45:06.720]  out along with a home movie showing zhokar talking to a little child not having an accent
[45:06.720 --> 45:13.840]  but so the story gets much stranger and we were also talking with one of the callers about the
[45:13.840 --> 45:19.120]  nsa this story just came out the nsa admits it analyzes more people's data than previously revealed
[45:19.120 --> 45:24.000]  about that we've been telling you that for years and years at info wars and we told you when it
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.200]  came out it was not just about metadata it was about storing everything that's why they're building
[45:29.200 --> 45:34.240]  the utah data center that's going online if it's not already online uh we can't trust anything
[45:34.240 --> 45:40.640]  they tell us not even the dates that the spy uh storage areas are going online chris englis the
[45:40.640 --> 45:44.720]  agency's deputy director was one of several government representatives including those from
[45:44.720 --> 45:48.960]  the fbi in the office of the director of national intelligence to testify before the house judiciary
[45:48.960 --> 45:55.520]  committee yesterday and his statement was new he said that analysts are now taking two or three
[45:55.520 --> 46:00.960]  hops from terror suspects when evaluating terror activity so they're maintaining that they have
[46:00.960 --> 46:07.520]  the right to start monitoring you without really getting a court order now they can also monitor
[46:07.520 --> 46:13.600]  people who are not just a friend of the person that is the quote-unquote suspect but they can
[46:13.600 --> 46:18.560]  monitor two or three levels and direct from that remember the seven degrees of kevin bacon
[46:18.560 --> 46:23.200]  where you know the game where you can um take a movie that kevin bake was in and you can
[46:23.200 --> 46:28.240]  relate it to all the different stars and you can pretty much find anybody in hollywood it turns out
[46:28.240 --> 46:35.680]  that uh back in um uh 2011 the university of malon found that uh everyone on the internet was on
[46:35.680 --> 46:43.120]  average 4.74 steps away from anyone else now the nsa has now said that they've gone three of those
[46:43.120 --> 46:49.440]  steps the bottom line is they're just grasping for any kind of justification no matter how shallow
[46:49.440 --> 46:56.560]  to spy on everybody to do a dragnet to avoid the fact that they need to have a reasonable cause
[46:56.560 --> 47:01.440]  before they search us according to the constitution let's go to another caller let's go to uh keith
[47:01.440 --> 47:06.400]  and indiana keith how you doing today what's your question or comment thank you very much i just wanted
[47:06.400 --> 47:11.600]  to comment about the snowden situation because four years ago i lived in langcaster pennsylvania
[47:12.320 --> 47:20.400]  and it had more cameras per population in any city in the united states to have the local government
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.440]  be able to watch what you were doing and i went to some town meetings about it and it struck me
[47:25.440 --> 47:33.040]  about the snowden uh situation was that people got used to the idea of being spied on in their own
[47:33.040 --> 47:38.800]  towns by their own government officials that by the time the federal government gets around to
[47:38.800 --> 47:44.000]  telling them they're doing it i just don't think a lot of people anymore have any particular
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.400]  anger about any of it absolutely lived in it's conditioning when i lived in langcaster i attended
[47:50.400 --> 47:56.480]  three or four meetings of community meetings about the cameras and the only people who went to the
[47:56.480 --> 48:03.040]  meetings were either ron paulers from what we would call the more conservative side or die hard
[48:03.040 --> 48:08.000]  leftists i mean some of them are literally like members of the communist party and they were only
[48:08.000 --> 48:15.120]  upset about the cameras because they thought the cameras were there to spy on them yeah they're
[48:15.120 --> 48:20.880]  there to spy on everybody well you know but but understand that you know the uh it only takes a
[48:20.880 --> 48:24.720]  dedicated minority as we've been told time and again and as we saw in the american revolution
[48:24.720 --> 48:29.040]  only takes a knowledgeable dedicated minority because you're always going to have the vast
[48:29.040 --> 48:35.840]  majority of people be sheep but it really is about desensitizing people it really is about
[48:35.840 --> 48:41.200]  conditioning that is what the tsa is about the tsa is about going after our freedom and dignity
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.240]  i remember i've told the story before about my wife she's a she has a master's degree in education
[48:46.240 --> 48:51.600]  she was uh she brought home a book called beyond freedom and dignity and i said it's about time
[48:51.600 --> 48:55.600]  somebody complained about the way we're treated in the government schools is i don't know no this
[48:55.600 --> 49:01.360]  isn't uh this isn't a protest book this is a blueprint and uh you know this this fellow bf
[49:01.360 --> 49:05.680]  scanner of course if you're familiar with his work you know that has become essentially the bible
[49:05.680 --> 49:12.000]  for government schools for the way the government treats us it is to uh uh the way the government
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.040]  operates the way the american government operates is is the same as the uh communist manifesto is
[49:17.040 --> 49:24.400]  or to the uh marxist same as mine comp is to the nazis it's essentially a call to action it's a
[49:24.400 --> 49:30.400]  it's a plan and if they can remove your dignity and your freedom they can do anything to you they
[49:30.400 --> 49:36.400]  can treat you and condition you like animals and that's exactly what the tsa is doing if you let
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.200]  them put their hands on you they immediately give you a very positive reward you're allowed to go
[49:41.200 --> 49:48.800]  fly see that's called positive operant conditioning that's skinners technique so you come in and you
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.840]  let them do whatever they want to to you because you're their slave and you immediately get a little
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.640]  reward the only thing they don't do is uh click something and give you a treat you know but uh
[49:58.640 --> 50:03.360]  you know you're you're intelligent enough that you know beforehand uh what's going on so it
[50:03.360 --> 50:07.840]  essentially works the same way as you train a dog or a horse or a dolphin and people are being
[50:07.840 --> 50:12.640]  trained like that all over the united states let's go to george in connecticut george how you doing
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.200]  hi mr night uh yeah i got a chance to get on uh one of the largest radio stations and uh
[50:19.200 --> 50:25.600]  w o r in the tri-state area 50 000 watts uh they were trying to vilify uh the brothers uh for this
[50:25.600 --> 50:32.320]  uh rolling stones article and i uh brought up the the fact is why are we uh believing why are we
[50:32.320 --> 50:38.480]  we trying to basically uh um you know make these people guilty beforehand the way you're you're
[50:39.280 --> 50:45.440]  you know presenting this i mean this is the the plan b uh argument anyway the plan a argument

[54:28.720 --> 54:32.960]  going to be joining us now i don't know if you saw it a couple of nights ago if you're a prison
[54:32.960 --> 54:38.960]  planet tv subscriber you did we had the world premiere on prison planet tv for our subscribers
[54:38.960 --> 54:46.480]  of state of mind but if you're like my family back in north carolina you've got very slow internet
[54:46.480 --> 54:50.160]  access uh you might want to get in on dvd there's a lot of people in that situation a lot of people
[54:50.160 --> 54:55.600]  would rather watch something on dvd than stream it anyway so uh that is still available at info
[54:55.600 --> 55:01.920]  wars dot com even in blu ray so uh pick that up it's a state of mind dot com and of course as we
[55:01.920 --> 55:08.000]  talked to um uh the fully informed jury association activist yesterday every time you order something
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.960]  from info wars dot com you also get a little pocket constitution and jury handbook and it tells you
[55:12.960 --> 55:19.520]  what your rights are uh judges power over you is your ignorance so understand what your rights are
[55:19.520 --> 55:24.320]  and what your duties are as a juror you you have to watch each other's backs it's very important
[55:24.320 --> 55:30.160]  that we re-establish jury trials in this country we've got alex uh joining us on the line how you
[55:30.160 --> 55:39.280]  doing alex or maybe we don't is he okay he's not on the line just yet okay we just lost him he's
[55:39.280 --> 55:45.920]  out on the road now this information just came in uh from the long war journal uh former ben
[55:45.920 --> 55:52.480]  laden doctors reportedly heading al-qaeda in the cyanide peninsula now that's kind of interesting
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.040]  that he's there that al-qaeda is in the cyanide peninsula but i find it even more interesting
[55:57.040 --> 56:03.120]  that um this this guy we we really need to find this guy because uh he's got to be like the best
[56:03.120 --> 56:10.320]  doctor in the world he kept ben laden who needed a dialysis machine he kept him alive for over a
[56:10.320 --> 56:17.200]  decade uh until it was convenient for obama to kill him uh you know that's not a that's not a
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.120]  small trick you know when you need a dialysis machine uh you can only go a couple of days
[56:21.120 --> 56:27.520]  without that typically so somebody needs to look up this ramsey malafi and they need to
[56:27.520 --> 56:33.440]  actually find out what he knows to keep people who need dialysis alive for decades without it i mean
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.640]  that that'll be a real groundbreaking uh piece of information to know we really need to to know that
[56:39.520 --> 56:43.040]  now we've also got some information breaking if you remember we talked yesterday about
[56:43.040 --> 56:50.800]  yahoo coming in and trying to clear their name now even microsoft is trying to do that
[56:51.520 --> 56:56.640]  these are companies that were exposed as part of the snowden leaks uh they were exposed to
[56:56.640 --> 57:02.560]  be part of the prism program essentially turning people's data over without people knowing it
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.800]  doing it in violation of their agreements with people but just flat out turning it over to the
[57:08.800 --> 57:15.760]  government having uh in many cases the government had equipment put into their servers so they could
[57:15.760 --> 57:20.640]  directly tap into it now microsoft is saying that uh they want to stand for the constitution
[57:21.200 --> 57:26.640]  kind of a sunshine patriot attitude in my opinion because microsoft was the very first
[57:27.280 --> 57:32.240]  company to sign on to prism according to the documents they did it back in 2007
[57:32.880 --> 57:36.640]  and these documents show that microsoft helped the nsa circumvent its encryption
[57:36.640 --> 57:42.000]  to address concerns of the agency would be unable to intercept web chats the agency already had
[57:42.000 --> 57:48.560]  pre encryption stage access to email on outlook including hotmail the company also worked with
[57:48.560 --> 57:55.600]  the fbi this year to allow the nsa easier access via prism to its cloud storage service sky drive
[57:55.600 --> 58:01.520]  which now has more than 250 million users online worldwide microsoft also worked with the fbi's
[58:01.520 --> 58:05.360]  data center intercept unit to understand potential issues of the feature that outlook
[58:05.360 --> 58:11.120]  dot com allowed users to create email aliases in july last year nine months after microsoft
[58:11.120 --> 58:15.280]  bought skype the nsa boasted that they could now triple the amount of skype calls but now
[58:15.920 --> 58:21.760]  microsoft is talking about the constitution why because the alternative media and ed snowden
[58:21.760 --> 58:25.920]  have exposed this and because people are starting to get upset we need to keep the heat on them and
[58:25.920 --> 58:41.840]  we need to turn it up we'll be right back with alex jones so stay tuned
[58:42.960 --> 58:47.040]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:46.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and we were just talking about the nsa and
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:56.160]  the things that are coming to light about their prison program yahu has sued and effectively won
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.440]  the release of some documents that are even though perhaps yahu was complicit in this
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.120]  they maintained that they were fighting it all along but i believe it's going to be important
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:10.480]  because i think it's going to shed some light on this secretive court the phisa court that
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:17.760]  essentially has no opposition has no we can't even see what the secretive findings are and yet
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.680]  they maintain that they are altering our constitution with their secretive court decisions
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:30.960]  that's not happening as we mentioned just before the break you may want to see a state of mind
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.880]  dot com it is available at info wars store dot com it's a great documentary it's a great way
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.960]  to wake up people to the many ways that the government is using the information that they
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:47.840]  collect on us as well as the mass media and the education system to brainwash us to it's not just
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:54.720]  an mk ultra program it's not just the state of the art kind of strange uh cia things that they're
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:00.240]  doing but it's very mundane broad-based things that are happening and you can pick that up at
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:07.920]  info wars store dot com it premiered this week on wednesday on prisonplanet.tv for our subscribers
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.680]  but you can get the dvd and pass that around even get that in blu-ray at info wars store dot com
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:21.520]  now we have a article here that is on info wars dot com is america's social contract broken
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.760]  as voltaire observed no snowflake and avalanche ever feels responsible and this is entirely
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:33.840]  and precisely how empires collapse you know it's uh when i see the term social contract
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.200]  i always think about a quote from lysander spooner i think i don't know if he said that about the
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.680]  social contractor who said about constitution as a document which he could not find his signature
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.880]  uh he's an interesting guy to look up sometime he's uh he's somebody one of the few people at
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.280]  the time of the civil war that had it exactly right he was an ardent abolitionist an opposition
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:03:00.320]  to slavery and yet at the same time he opposed the illegal unconstitutional invasion of the
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:09.440]  south by the union as well as the egregious dictatorial things that abraham lincoln was doing arresting
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.880]  opposition people declaring martial law instituting a draft instituting a fiat currency he opposed
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:21.760]  all those things and he also went into a business against the u.s post office he knew the post office
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.200]  was charging people way too much money he went into competition with them and it took a an act of
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.760]  congress essentially stop lysander spooner so that's an interesting thing but um it talks
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.880]  about the social contract and this article binding the citizens and the states and how they have
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:44.560]  destroyed that i'm also reminded of a quote from russell means who said that the constitution
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:50.560]  is the white man's treaty with the government and he said just like the government broke every
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.640]  treaty with the indians they are now breaking their treaty with you and that is really true
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.640]  it's never been more true and it's accelerating every day as we have been talking about
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:07.840]  the natural news reports that many welfare recipients now have higher incomes than the
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:13.280]  actual workers that are subsidizing their handouts that's pretty amazing it's one of the ways that
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.040]  this country is going bankrupt in a handbasket just like detroit detroit is not an aberration
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:25.280]  detroit is a pattern that we see developing for the first time in history the number of people in
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.360]  the u.s receiving assistance from the federal government to pay for food has exceeded the
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.640]  number of full-time private sector workers you understand that the people who are actually
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:41.520]  supporting the welfare system are in the minority this is far worse than the demographics even of
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:46.960]  social security which also is going to be unsustainable but we're going to be right back stay tuned
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:59.120]  alex is going to be joining us as soon as we get a good connection on it stay tuned
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.520]  are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us as we've moved through history
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:10.960]  every great leader has had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:18.560]  have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:25.040]  state education to the hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:30.320]  ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.560]  testing it out and verifying it they can take total control of your awareness all of this is
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.080]  happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the opinion of the american
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:46.240]  people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war another one another plane just

[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:52.720]  to take my son and daughter fishing that i would be doing an hour here on friday covering the news
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:09:04.240]  news but now we have so much so much breaking news that we're going to be covering we're

[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.080]  unfortunately earlier they thought because i had phone backup that's why we had a reverb echo

[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.840]  cover some of the news and then as soon as i'm able to i'm going to get on a phone line and just

[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.040]  we look forward talking to you you know uh one of the things is breaking as well as the news
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.320]  about zocars arenaev is the news about fluoride it just keeps building because you know the truth
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.080]  is not going to go away and we've got a lot of former water fluoridation advocates now calling
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:36.880]  for an end to what is an outmoded and unsafe practice according to natural news so this is
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.200]  brief history to the original campaign to instigate water fluoridation policy going back to the
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:47.360]  mid 20th century the work of edwin bernays and you want to talk about mind control that fits in
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:53.360]  you know that's the the guy who invented propaganda and uh that's something that is in the documentary
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:59.280]  state of mind as well as the way it's people are being controlled by the educational system uh he was
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:06.720]  sigman freud's nephew but actually they began a program of propaganda to get people to believe
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:13.920]  that fluoridation actually was necessary for reducing tooth decay and that's not really the
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:21.120]  truth actually before officials from the aluminum industry got in charge of what was what eventually
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.920]  became the fda fluoride was recognized for what it is and that is a poison you know i was just
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:34.160]  recently looking at a home here in austin to buy and this home had termites in it and they were
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.680]  talking about how well it needed to be fumigated and that's what they're fumigating it with
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:46.320]  and they it was basically a fluoride gas you know fluoride is used as a pesticide is labeled that
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:53.200]  in china it is a byproduct of the aluminum and nuclear industries and instead of having to dispose
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:59.680]  of this toxic waste and pay for that disposal what they do is they charge municipalities to put it
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:06.480]  in our water and you know when you put poison in the water there's not really a safe minimal amount
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:12.560]  and we've got uh activists who are organizing on planet info wars and other places to try to talk to
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:18.960]  their local municipalities in the case of rolly north carolina when they did that the officials
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:25.520]  there laughed at them and drank a toast of fluoridated tap water to their honor you know even
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:31.440]  though there was a local news report that covered the issue of fluoridation so a lot of times you
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:36.560]  just have to do it on your own and that's why we sell the pro pure filter here at info wars store
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:43.040]  dot com and you can get it for 10 off it's the most effective gravity feed filter you can find out
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:50.240]  there it gets rid of all the variant forms of fluoride which other gravity feed filters do not
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.600]  do you have to get a very complicated filter to get some of those forms out but it is the only
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.520]  one that does it as a gravity feed filter so you know try to try to get involved with activism try
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.960]  to change the laws for your health and for the health of your neighbors but if you can't do it
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.160]  you ultimately need to take responsibility for your life and do it yourself if you can't find
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:19.680]  somebody to help you now we have the tray von death has been creating riots throughout la and
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.520]  other places and yet is anyone talking about the kids that have been killed by obama with drone
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.440]  strikes no not really an article from prison planet tv by anthony gucciardi he points out that
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:39.680]  we have a 16 year old k a citizen that was killed without any form of trial but instead of actually
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:46.560]  giving due process to people obama is doing the same thing all over the world as a matter of fact
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:52.720]  if you remember the very first time it kind of created a precedent when he killed an american
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.080]  citizen abroad in yemen and then later killed his son who was about the same age as trevon
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.920]  and we're going to go to some of your calls here um we've had some people calling in let's go to uh
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:10.480]  mark in oregon mark how are you morning david morning how you doing i'm doing all right david
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.280]  i just want to thank you briefly for you know the excellent work that uh you and the crew do
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.360]  well thank you what would you have a comment or a question yes actually uh what you do takes
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:27.280]  courage and uh when it comes to actually as you've mentioned earlier in the program today
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:37.760]  a demonstrating in mass will actually create what i think your phrase was in mass it was around that
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:44.800]  which means um most all of the people who uh see what's going on and know the wrongness of it
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:50.080]  and the harm that it does and the death that it causes in this country and around the world but
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.080]  for this country david i've mentioned this to alex before and it seems to me like a
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:05.520]  a tremendously strong muscle car of uh publicity and information for people uh many things come out
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:12.560]  of a mass demonstration and you have this vehicle there which is ready to go and i call it the same
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:20.880]  thing you call it planet info wars because the show alex all of you guys what you put together
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:28.000]  is actually uh for years now gained international attention and it's the only show that does this
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:36.400]  and alex is a born natural leader and people look up to him as that and that's what people
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.720]  need these days because they're feeling especially in this country and other countries intimidated
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.520]  and they intimidate us intentionally to keep us quiet now take the planet info wars and run with
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:53.600]  it organize people organize mass demonstrations all across the country on the same days and you
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.320]  have a home menu of grievances and that's really the meat of my call david i just like your comment
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.560]  if you have a moment that's a great idea you know you you say it takes courage to do this actually
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.840]  it takes an understanding of the fact that uh there is any place to hide you know what we're
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.640]  trying to get people to understand is is that uh they're not just watching alex they're not just
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.840]  watching me or the people who work here they're watching you people don't realize that you know
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.800]  we had the comedian do the skit where he's walking around with a boom mic and putting it over
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.320]  people's heads and and that annoys them because they realize what's happening if people understood
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.920]  what the government is doing to them through this nsa spying they would be rightfully outraged i
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.680]  believe and yet because it's done in a secretive manner and uh not too many news outlets are really
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.280]  talking about it instead they want to talk about ed snowden they don't want to talk about what the
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:51.520]  nsa did uh they want to talk about how they can uh increase the effectiveness there we go there's
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:18:01.600]  the uh the comedian what was his name again um i'm sorry what tom tom babe so you know it made
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:09.840]  babe okay anyway uh yeah tom made alex interviewed him it was a great interview a great comedy skit
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.120]  but it really makes an important point that when people realize you can see it up there on the monitor
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.720]  he's he's holding this boom mic uh over people's heads as they're having a private conversation
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.520]  that's what the government is doing all the time with this nsa stuff and they're ignoring the
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:32.320]  constitution so yes i i believe it's a great idea to uh get people to organize we have uh
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.680]  planted info wars is a means for people to hook up with each other and do it maybe we should do
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.400]  something that's a little bit more formal to try to organize that now certainly we have tried to
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:49.840]  organize people to speak out to produce movies and films we have uh operation paul revere which is
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:55.360]  in approaching its final stages next week on monday we're going to have the finalist announced
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.960]  it's going to be like the top five percent of the entries that we've had and then later in the week
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:05.360]  on thursday and friday we're going to have the third place and second place winners announced
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.200]  and the following monday will be the grand prize winner now these are big contest amounts the third
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:17.360]  place prize is five thousand dollars second place is ten thousand dollars and the grand prize winner
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:24.400]  is a hundred thousand dollars we have a lot of really good entries and this has been a very
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.480]  difficult task to sort through these things we've got a lot of people here at the crew that are
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.720]  looking at these so that we get more than one person looking at them we've got multiple people
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:39.920]  looking at each entry it has been a lot of work we had more than six hundred entries come in
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.400]  and uh you're going to really like what you see i think what's there right now is a couple hundred
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.720]  entries and we're going to be having the finalists on monday so stay tuned and we'll be right back

[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.360]  capitalism or was jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.960]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army ted anderson on placing a
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.960]  free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system call for your copy 800 686 2237

[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.520]  unbelievably the media are keeping quiet about this i'm sure they know it but they probably know
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:19.840]  that revealing it on tv will generate mass hysteria and chaos but i believe you should be informed
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:25.280]  about it because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:31.840]  only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive go to one two three conspiracy dot com

[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:06.640]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filly in for alex but we have alex on the line
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:23.840]  and he wants to talk to us about what's just been revealed about zocar sarne of alex yes
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.240]  when i saw this this morning by curtain ammo it's red linked up on info wars dot
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.560]  did he just drop out on us okay well looks like we just lost that it's a
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.240]  yeah it's a very important story this is the article that we covered a little bit earlier
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.880]  i just a little bit i wanted to hear what alex had to say about it but this is the picture
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.840]  that was released now this is a picture that was not supposed to come out and the sergeant was fired
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:58.960]  because he put it out but it you know he released this because he was angry that the rolling stones
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.640]  picture looked too glamorous so what he did was he actually showed the picture of zocar
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.320]  and you can see that his throat wasn't cut and we were told as kurt points out in the article
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:16.480]  we were told that uh at various stages that he had been uh it shot himself in the throat we had
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:19.840]  been told that his throat had been cut we've been told that he wasn't going to be able to talk to us
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.360]  not be able to communicate we were told for the longest time they maintained this story
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:32.400]  and now we see no evidence of that just another piece of the false fly that we've been fed there
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:40.240]  now we also have some news that we covered just briefly yesterday about the tsa the tsa is now
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:49.360]  going through cars that are parked in valet parking uh this was a local news story out of albany and
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.080]  the woman called to complain to the television station let's take a look at that for people who
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.120]  are watching the broadcast this is what they actually put in the car can you guys break pull
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:05.360]  that up on the screen that's what you should under the tsa regulations yeah your vehicle has been
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:11.200]  inspected under the tsa regulations there you go thank you for your patronage your vehicle has
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:16.720]  been inspected under tsa regulations now what she said was she was never told that her car was going
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:22.560]  to be checked by the tsa after they went ahead and did this story they went back and after it became
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:28.960]  an issue they did put up a sign and uh they said and she said she was so happy unfortunately she
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.040]  said she was so happy that uh she felt safer when they were doing it she was just concerned they
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:39.200]  hadn't told her beforehand interestingly enough they weren't checking all the cars they were only
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.160]  checking the cars that were in valet parking and i think this has something to do with what's going
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:49.440]  on with syspo what's going on with the prism program and that is this whole idea that they think
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.920]  that they can violate the fourth amendment if they get the permission of some third party but
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.360]  we've got alex back on the line and i really want to hear what he has to say about zhokar sarnaya
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:03.280]  valix yeah i just want the listeners to know i've not been intentionally for a 30 minutes trying to
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.640]  build this up here on air uh just bizarre we do these digital tests they work fine as soon as i
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.760]  get on air all hell breaks loose but when we come back to the next segment we're going to tell you
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:21.120]  why we keep talking about zhokar zharnaya and the big news associated with that it's up on info
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:27.840]  wars.com it's a story by Kurt Nemo and it's just buried in the back of the boston globe
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:34.640]  that's buried in the back of the papers on the east coast and when i see something like this totally
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:44.240]  proving everything we've said in quadruplicate it doesn't make me feel good it makes me physically
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:51.280]  ill it's not like oh we've caught them now isn't this great it is a hundred percent fact
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:02.880]  that the cia and umland security were involved at every level of the bombing in boston on
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:12.320]  april 15th 2013 and there is no doubt that info wars.com my radio show everything the listeners
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:17.520]  damn it on to you name it absolutely got in the middle of their official story
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:23.200]  and blew it wide open and that's also super creepy this is not fun this is not a game
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:29.840]  this is not a joke i wish every day that oklahoma city would have been a real event i wish it
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:34.640]  wouldn't have happened to a but b if it's going to happen alone wolf is a lot less scary to discover
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:39.440]  how the feds ran the attack to know the names of the feds that were there with mcbay to have the

[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:52.160]  bombing uh... to have the witnesses on seven seven to know it was run by mi six the London
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.920]  bombings to know all of this is disgusting ladies and gentlemen because we sit here and we see

[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.840]  as a man made but we kind of know that but he's really an expert on the global treaty and the
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.320]  global government so maybe we can get into him and talk a little bit about that uh... so that's
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:34.320]  coming up in the third hour on this friday edition but uh... the reason i get so angry is that i'm

[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:35.440]  of info or timely news is riding shotgun i am joining you via phone from the texas coast i've
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:43.360]  promised for a year to take my son to go fishing for alligator gar on the edge of the gulf of
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:49.760]  mexico and we caught uh and of course threw him back for his pure sports fishing four big ones
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:55.600]  uh hooked him and landed him yesterday one of about 90 pounds i sent that photo out on twitter
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.320]  so i'm i'm blanking and i'm like everybody else and my children are growing up so i thought i'd
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:06.480]  take a few days off but it's no good i've just been breeding info wars dot com and drug report
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:12.240]  dot com and all the other news sites and just getting sicker and sicker and sicker because
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:19.040]  like any parent i look at my innocent children my two dollars and my son uh and i see how innocent
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:25.520]  and good and and and wholesome they are and i see just how unbelievably wicked the world is
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:32.400]  and how it's getting wickeder by the moment you know it's almost a curse to have a good memory
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:40.320]  and to be informed into no history and to be involved it's it's almost a curse because when
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:44.480]  you're aware of history and you know what's happening you're not just blissfully ignorant
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:52.320]  uh you sit back and you watch just the incredible fraud and corruption you watch your country taken
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:58.320]  over by foreign offshore banks you watch the media turned into a total brainwashing system to demonize
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:05.920]  the family to try to uh dumb children down to try to destroy children's innocence you see medicalized
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:12.800]  tyranny uh with the children being given abortions by schools without parental consent vaccines
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.400]  without consent um california and of course every state but they got caught two weeks ago was still
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:25.360]  engaging in forced sterilization illegally and not getting in trouble and that's the point i keep
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:31.840]  getting back to over and over again is that a criminal guild globally has almost gotten in control
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:37.200]  they're in control of most of the us most of europe most of the uk and they're and they're
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:44.400]  persecuting and running a purge against people in corporate systems and in government and in
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:53.200]  academia and in religion who are just normal humans this is a cultural spiritual genetic
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:59.440]  rewrite being carried out by the eugenicist and so this morning when i saw the story up on info
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:08.160]  wars dot com the curtain emo did it made me physically angry uh to where i am just beside
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:15.040]  myself with with controlled focus anger right now because it confirms everything we've seen
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:21.200]  and everything that happened ladies and gentlemen i followed the boston bombing from the minutes
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:28.640]  after it happened and i had a guest on the year an author talking about false flags
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:38.080]  when it actually happened when it actually uh was unfolding and i said on that april 15th
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:44.560]  for radio show i mean it happened while i was on the radio i said look for a drill look for a
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:50.000]  stand down look for patsy so they're going to have aram patsy's and right wing patsy's i don't
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.640]  know what plan they're going to go with but it's probably going to be right wing patsy's because
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:01.040]  i've been seeing the conditioning that there'd be ied's or improvised explosive device attacks
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.880]  that were imminent on crowds in america and that's why homeland security had to roll out and
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:13.680]  basically set up martial law nationwide so i saw the pre-programming and i said in the days before
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:19.520]  get ready false flag is imminent because i mean i live this stuff and then boom it happened and we
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.720]  saw the drill that happened two months before a bombing the marathon we found out there was a
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.920]  drill that day we had witnesses there was a drill it later came out that there was a drill
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.720]  and then they were going to burn a right winger a few days later but then dropped all of that
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:42.480]  evacuated the courthouse disappeared whoever the person was they had and moved on to the
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:49.760]  zharnev brothers sohar zharnev and tamerlan zharnev and then sure enough i said let's see
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.840]  we know there was a drill we know there was a standout we know there were contractors out there
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:58.480]  they used that as the cover most people involved and the government aren't involved
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:05.360]  let's see if tamerlan or the younger brother are ending up working for a foundation group sending
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:11.280]  in people to form al-qaeda groups against the russians which is a stated pentagon globalist
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:16.560]  30 year plus program sure enough it came out in the british in the russian news confirmed state
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:23.760]  department responded uh... the tamerlan had aliases that homeland security allowed him to use
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:30.320]  he was funded by the george town society founded by the big the brazilian others directly to form
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:35.040]  radical wahhabist sex in the area i'm just giving you a background before i give you the new bombshell
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:40.720]  ladies and gentlemen and it just went on and on then two fbi agents that were involved in the
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:47.360]  investigation in boston fallout of a helicopter then the the the the friend of the older zharnev
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:54.480]  brother uh... they go to his house he says they're coming to kill me they strap him down in a chair
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.360]  shoot him in the top of the head and they've declared national security on the autopsy
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.480]  just like they've done with michael hastings i mean folks they're doing this in the open now
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:11.920]  and it just goes on and on and on and then rolling stone comes out saying the bomber
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:18.480]  everybody says it's glorifying the bomber which that's only one sub level that's a smaller level
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:26.400]  of it 25 percent of it 75 percent of the outrage is that they're saying he's the bomber this is
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:33.200]  this magazine came out was printed four or five days after he pled not guilty and they knew he was
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.080]  going to plead not guilty we've talked to the lawyers we've talked to family members i'm not a
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:44.080]  liberty to give all this out but they've been threatened and they know it's an inside job and
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:49.440]  it turns out a bunch of the family is hooked in to the central intelligence agency so understand
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:55.440]  ladies and gentlemen i've psychoanalyzed why i get so viciously angry when i see stuff like this
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:02.240]  because i'm risking my life okay this is not a game this is not a joke this is literally a death
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:09.200]  struggle for this country and that's why i get physically angry when i saw the leaked and you
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:17.040]  watch they're gonna prosecute this guy with the state police this guy leaked it saying he was
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:22.880]  angry and that made me spin that that this guy was being you know shown as some type of icon
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:27.440]  by the news media i don't believe that's what it is that's the news spinning it why would
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:32.160]  why would the state police photographer say he was angry so he released it that's not even his
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.920]  statement i believe they're saying that they they are again this is info wars dot com right now what
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:47.120]  am i getting at the latest big piece of news it goes on to say zoe hars throat wound another
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:54.480]  government lie bites the dust and it goes on to say and show high-def photos of him with the lasers
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:41:03.120]  on him no cut no blood on the neck this is now at the same level not not from above from a news
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:10.320]  camera now this is the same level nothing wrong with his throat folks i was watching a use stream
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:18.560]  feed that had a million two hundred thousand viewers on it of the live police scanner when he was in
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:33.360]  that boat and they opened fire with more than 15 full auto m16 and 308 hk91 type rifles and every
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:39.040]  inch had bullet holes as they tried to kill him let's go back before this latest news and all
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:44.720]  the lies only covered a fraction there was no robbery of a 711 that's now confirmed it's clearly
[01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:50.080]  come out it was a friendly fire the dead cops probably just being killed to create some smoke
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:56.640]  screen the brothers yelled on the news camera it's not us we didn't do it we didn't do it as they
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:02.560]  tried to kill them witnesses all said that tamer when was alive when they put him on the ground
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:08.560]  and then ran over him they wanted to get rid of the witnesses they're killing fbi agents they're
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:15.280]  killing their friends that were clearly cia assets going overseas with them this is unbelievable
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:26.640]  then we are about to go live on the news that night it's 645 central 745 eastern i'm in the news
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.480]  office by the tv studio we have you stream up this is back on the night this happened
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:39.520]  that night they capture him a few days after the 15th of april and i am watching i am watching
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:47.200]  you stream and they've shot up the boat a few hours before they're sending in armored vehicles
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:51.360]  checking to see that he's dead and i hear the police and there's a recording of this anybody
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:56.880]  can go look this up on the you stream archive and they're like oh no media got in a building
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:02.720]  across the the water there there's a little body of water and they've got a live feed well
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:08.320]  we go turn the tv on the tv was actually on we could see sure enough about a minute later it
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:15.760]  goes on tv the boat and the flapping tarp and now the cops couldn't kill him now there's a news
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:23.440]  camera right on it in high depth so they tell him come out he comes out i see his throat he comes
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:28.320]  out with energy there's no blood on his throat because it was it was down and from an angle but
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.120]  i could clearly see there was no blood we blew up the video minutes later he's on the ground
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:37.520]  barely alive with them chopping his throat open and you can go to all the news articles that
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:43.520]  demonized me lomburg ap you name it and say look at crazy alex jones saying they did a
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:49.600]  throat surgery they did they cut into his throat so that he couldn't talk there's there's there's
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.080]  the photos and videos of that of them cutting into his throat they gave he gets up crawls out
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:59.280]  no blood out of his neck they cut into his throat god knows how hard they're torturing him for him
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.440]  to be able to still come to trial and say not guilty they're probably in there right now electro
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.720]  shocking this guy i mean i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen this guy has got incredible will
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.800]  the level of torture he's been going through they tried to send him to get no they couldn't do that
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.200]  because people are awake the courts are somewhat awake and so they've got him in there right now
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:22.240]  torturing him hammer and tongs up one side and down the other you can be guaranteed so here's a
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.280]  big here's a big story because national review you know wrote a hit piece saying i'm incoherent
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:33.760]  no i'm not incoherent reality is complex details are complex i don't sit here and talk to people
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.160]  like they're two years old i've just given the listeners a briefing reminding them on everything
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:44.080]  that happened in this continuum everything that happened in this space and time everything that
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:50.160]  unfolded everything that went on just the basics it goes on and on and on and on and on the whole
[01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:56.480]  story is a lie on its face the fbi and secret service threatening dan badandi saying we're
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:00.880]  going to get you if you don't shut up this is on the news when they come over what is the secret
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.600]  service doing at press conferences and nothing to do with a secret service they were sent there
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.960]  to shut badandi our reporter down who was there to hand out images of the drills and there to
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:17.520]  hand out hand out info to the media so they could understand how this really works this is what info
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:27.680]  wars is doing this is how far we're going so we have so hard zharnov we've got him in in high death
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:32.320]  images of your radio listener go to info wars dot com you remember you were told he was shot in the
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:39.120]  throat he climbed down and then suddenly he was on the edge of dying they but there were other cops
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:46.720]  there who were not part of the inside job who were not part of the the corrupt federal teams
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:52.240]  and so they were unable to kill him then he goes to the hospital they know they're being watched
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:58.880]  then they announced in the news he said he did it now imagine you you can't talk you're chained down
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:05.680]  in a hospital your brother was in a cia as an asset that's on record they've killed your brother
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:10.640]  they're killing other people you're in there and they put on the news the boston globe the boston
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:16.640]  herald that sources say you confessed folks they could disappear alex jones they could disappear
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:23.200]  anybody they could disappear anybody who's prominent and then just say from his hospital bed he admits
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:28.800]  he did it oh and then put it on the cover of rolling stone that you're the bomber see this is a
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:36.320]  complete attack on justice on due process and we now have high-deaf photos of him with laser beam
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:43.280]  lights on him climbing out of the boat by the grace of god the bullets all missing but some
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.240]  that reportedly hit him in the foot and grazed his back so by the grace of god they sit there
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:54.720]  in concerted fire with a line of machine guns firing and they said he fired at them with a gun
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:03.440]  oh another problem there was no gun see lies lies lies lies he had a gun in there they they they
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:09.440]  robbed a 7-eleven they killed cops none of it's true it's all been admitted to be a fraud and now
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:16.640]  we have a high-deaf photo leaked by the state police to the boston newspapers showing him
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:24.400]  not a bullet wound not a cut not a drop of blood on his neck in blaring light of course
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.200]  ladies and gentlemen now are we going to get a gold star for being vindicated the first to say
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.960]  they chopped into his neck no we're not well i might get a hit team sent down here to kill me
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:39.760]  that's the prize i'll probably get because you need to understand folks they have to take down
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:44.880]  the press and take down the courts and take down due process before they take the country
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:50.560]  completely down this is a globalist takeover of america so i'm telling listeners right now
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.040]  again alex jones here joining of the phone david knight riding shotgun from the info war center
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:02.800]  so hard as our nev's throat wound another government lie by the dust and he goes over that particular
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:08.640]  lie and i think we need to add to this all the articles we wrote with previous lies perhaps on
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:14.640]  the nightly news tonight we need to go over all the lies that i just mentioned and there's even more
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:20.560]  more didn't rob the 7-11 didn't shoot the cops yeldon said they were innocent ran over the brother
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:26.720]  brother was working for the cia on record had aliases that he was allowed to travel back and
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:31.280]  forth in the u.s with the friend gets executed they said he attacked the police they admit he
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:37.760]  didn't they declared national security on the autopsy this week monday won't release it on
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:43.520]  and on and on didn't have guns in the boat didn't shoot at cops no he's hiding in there
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:48.720]  they figure out he's in there they send up an armored vehicle look and see he's in there and
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:56.320]  they open fire to kill the witness kill the witness kill the witness kill him kill him kill him kill
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:02.240]  him kill him just like lee harvey oswald they had to have jack ruby go up and shoot him and as

[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:38.320]  asset they were playboys with girls and wearing fancy clothes and partying they were set up just
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:43.840]  like the people on seven seven these guys were anti-muslim extremists and probably weren't even
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:48.240]  muslims from the friends that knew them they were party animals who thought that they would
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:54.000]  have been recruited by these cia ads you see on tv you see all these cia ads everywhere about
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.640]  join the cia and they come to the high schools now and say join it let me tell the young people
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:04.080]  something if you ever get hired as an asset of the cia or any other federal or agency or group
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:10.000]  or contractor and they want you to carry a simulated bomb into an airport don't do it if they want
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.480]  you to be part of a drill that we know they were having don't do it because let me tell you something
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:19.280]  they're going to blow stuff up and blame it on you and if you happen to run an escape they're
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:24.400]  going to kill you and kill your family and puts you on the news as a terrorist because this isn't

[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:16.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night in the studio we've got alex jones on the
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:22.400]  phone and if you just heard that last segment that was a massive expose of this false flag
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:27.840]  boston bombing from the very beginning and i tell you it was really amazing to be here and to see
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:33.200]  all this unfold i mean to see cnn responding to our reports basically in real time you know we're
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.720]  pointing things out that didn't really fit and uh then they would trump out some uh former fbi
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:43.040]  agent and go through a dog and pony show to cover up for the government's obvious and glaring
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:48.720]  inconsistencies and lies and their stories and alex has been talking about the latest one that just
[01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:53.600]  broke today these pictures of zhokar's arne of alex you want to continue that's right zhokar's
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:58.560]  zharnay of and and again the reason i start hyperventilating is this is like being very
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:03.280]  alive ladies and gentlemen when you know how real this is when you know that we're actually
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:08.800]  contending with these devils at an international level and they're responding and demonizing us
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:14.640]  and saying we should be you know gone after by the government this isn't a game this isn't my
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:21.360]  opinion folks they the globalist criminal element staged the boston bombing we caught them with
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:27.360]  their pants down around their ankles their hand in the cookie jar the whole thing is a verified
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:36.400]  lie and here's the big trillion pound enchilada no mainstream media will dare look at any of it
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:41.920]  and in the past folks they would have brought this up just 10 years ago as controlled as it was
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:46.720]  the FBI and that press conference pointed at the media and they said no one go talk to that man
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:53.360]  no one go look at the photographs he's got our reporter had the news articles about the drill
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:59.040]  the boston globe that no one want to look at he had the photos of the drill the bomb sniffing
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.120]  dogs and all the black backpacks and i'm not even saying those guys in the drill were involved
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.640]  they were all standing around looking around with the bomb went off like what in the world just
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:11.920]  happened that's how they do it and then they tell them don't talk about the drill it'll confuse the
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:19.440]  public folks they're pathological the globalists run the same play and why not it works i mean
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.320]  the hail mary worked every time if i was a football coach and i had a quarterback and a wide receiver
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:30.640]  that never missed and never dropped the ball what would i run hail mary's all day long and folks
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:35.840]  they run these hail mary's but my life is like living around other people like in those movies
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:39.760]  where the other people don't move and then you can just move and walk around everybody and
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:43.840]  they won't listen to you and you can't even communicate with them i mean this is a hundred
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:50.720]  percent folks they told you oh oh he's bleeding out of the neck he he can't talk they caught him
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:58.160]  and went and cut his freaking throat out on tv and i said i said folks pull up the articles i want
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:01.760]  to put this on the valley news tonight not to toot my horn but to show folks that we're right
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:08.800]  you can go back and find uh you know articles everywhere from salon to ap to roiders going
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:16.000]  alex jones says he didn't have a throat wound and wasn't shot alex jones says hey cut his cut cut
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.200]  into his larynx well let me see you get out you're not bleeding out of your neck i saw the video
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:26.480]  now we have high depth photos and then you walk over in five minutes later there's medics with
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:31.680]  scalpels into your throat i mean i worked it for the large animal vet folks i've done cesarean
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:36.960]  sections i've helped cut through things with scalpels i wasn't born yesterday i'm a firearms
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:41.840]  person too i mean that's that's part of the torture of this is being informed they grabbed this poor
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:46.960]  young man who believed he was an american patriot these guys believe they were infiltrating
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:52.320]  muslim groups for america and this is what they did to him i had the aunt coming on david you
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.400]  talked to her we have a recording part of it she's ready to come on they called up and threatened her
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:02.320]  she said my children and started broke down they threatened her minutes after she agreed to come on
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:08.000]  they're listening to the phone lines ladies and gentlemen this is not a game is what i'm trying
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:13.280]  to say i feel like uh the guy in terminator the first terminator when he's in the police station
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:16.640]  and he's telling him what's happening and they're not listening and they go this guy's crazy he's
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:21.200]  got a great story but you know what as soon as the terminator comes to the front door then they
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:25.440]  know how real it is and it's the same thing with the new world order folks this is not a game
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.720]  of begging everybody listen to me they took that young man and tried to kill him and when they
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:35.360]  couldn't they cut his throat out and when they brought him into jail he had injuries all over him
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:40.240]  that were not there in these high-def photos they have been torturing him they probably cut his fingers

[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:50.240]  that out and talking about how this has been a pattern of an evolving lie ever since the story

[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.680]  with richard belzer and they were talking about the conspiracies behind the jfk assassination as
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:06.080]  this thing happened and so alex took it all the way back to that point said the thing to look out
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:10.160]  for is a drill going on at the same time and of course that was there and it was just one thing
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.680]  after the other alex absolutely and again i'm not acting when i start hyperventilating and stuff
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:22.160]  but i am acting i'm letting myself get upset like i really am as almost therapy because i can't handle
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:26.160]  not being honest with people and i think the reason i'm effective is i reach back into human
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:34.080]  instinct to get people upset like they should be folks this definitely a giant racketeering
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:40.320]  operation colluding to lie about every stage of this deal and they're killing people to cover it up
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:46.000]  and they're declaring national security but it shows how leakers can bring them down that the
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:52.560]  state police photographer leaked this they're trying to spend why he did it showing that zharnov
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:56.880]  was set up and they're keeping us from talking to swat team members that we have contact with
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:02.000]  that are friends with our reporters uh from the marines uh they're they're trying to block us at
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.440]  every level so so that's on top of it so i need curtain demos on a great job covering this today
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:13.680]  to add the other smoking guns to the bottom of his article and then i want to put this in the
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:20.400]  august issue of the magazine that is about to come out because we're going to press next week
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:27.440]  i want to have a big article and and and and add in the curts article uh today the fact that they
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:34.720]  didn't rob the 7-11 uh they were connected to the cia curd first broke that uh in the us uh that
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:39.760]  you could just basically let's not even overdo it let's just go over you know the smoking gun
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:47.120]  lies of this thing and how it's a lie from start to finish he didn't have a gun inside the uh
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:52.160]  boat i mean they tried to kill him they killed the other brother they're killing the other witnesses
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:56.640]  because ladies and gentlemen they're not invincible this can bring them down they ran
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.280]  fast and furious that killed thousands of people hundreds on this side of the border
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.720]  to try to blame the second amendment of course they did this and it's not fun to have to confront
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:12.400]  these killers i'm doing this because we don't have any future if we don't where is the media
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:16.240]  we need our listeners we're going to tweet this real alex jones right now i'm going to tweet the
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:22.160]  story right now we'd everybody to go to info wars dot com and get this and retweet it and post it
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:28.320]  on facebook and send it to local talk show host and say wait he climbed out of the thing and his
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:32.800]  throat wasn't hurt and then they told us he was shot in the throat so he couldn't talk to the media
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.000]  so they could put out a fake confession and he's now pled not guilty and and and who knows if the
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.360]  guy in court's even him there's some evidence it may not be our country is under criminal takeover
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:50.800]  and folks they wouldn't be going this falls out all the way if they weren't planning to completely
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:56.640]  bring this country down this is not a game and hiding and countering to this is going to destroy
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:02.880]  us ladies and gentlemen so i'm calling on real media alternative mainstream whatever it is this
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:08.000]  case has completely collapsed and this is the type of thing that can capture the public's attention
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.880]  that this guy's throat was unheard and then you show the photos and video stills of his throat
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:19.840]  cut open with them fishing into it with scalpels minutes later god knows they may have killed him
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:26.000]  and then brought in a double we don't even know now that is how insanely evil this government is
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.120]  and we need more people in the police in the military to leak like they've done now this is
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:35.440]  what god hastings killed michael hastings said it's time to expose this the government's evil
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:41.680]  it's taken over it's illegitimate it's destroying america this is a call to political arms and they
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.400]  killed him i'm gonna hand things over to you david night a great job please support info wars dot

[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:19.600]  to it he's a true renaissance man he's not only a businessman he's been a newspaper editor an
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:25.200]  inventor a classical architect and he has been a special advisor to margaret thatcher as prime
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:31.120]  minister one of the things that is not usually talked about about lord montan is that in 1999
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:36.000]  as part of his businessman aspect i guess he created and published the eternity puzzle
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.920]  which is a geometric puzzle that involved tilting a dodecahedron with 209 irregularly shaped polygons
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:48.160]  called poly drafters he offered a million dollar prize and after a year and a half it was won by a
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:52.960]  couple of cambridge mathematicians but by that time he had sold a half million puzzles he did it again
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:59.200]  in 2007 but after four years nobody had solved his puzzle well you know he's a real puzzle solver
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:06.240]  and he's going to help us solve this puzzle this uh false narrative of global warming which is
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:10.800]  something of a scam and you know kind of like people have said of los vegas it's a city that's
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:16.560]  been built on the backs of people don't understand math well you know global warming and carbon taxes
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:22.320]  are burden that are going to be put on the backs of people that don't understand what's going on
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:28.000]  don't understand how to look at a uh a chart and see a trend don't understand how to honestly analyze
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.720]  a trend analysis lord montan how are you doing pleasure to talk to you it's very good to hear
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:37.920]  you i'm in fine fettle i've just been watching with great amusement the hearing the senate has
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:44.160]  just held on this held on the subject of whether global warming is really happening and the truth
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:49.680]  is of course it hasn't now been happening for somewhere between 15 and 17 years there hasn't
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:55.840]  been any global warming and that is beginning to give the usual suspects something to worry about
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:01.600]  they've been very arrogant until now they've said there's a consensus and of course they fiddled
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:09.280]  the consensus as well a paper came out in a journal which i suspect was created just so that they
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.960]  could publish this paper because no proper peer-reviewed journal would ever have published it and the
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:23.840]  paper claimed that 97 percent of nearly 12 000 extracts from scientific papers supported the
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:31.040]  consensus that more than half the warming of the last uh sort of 50 years was caused by us but in
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:38.880]  fact a closer analysis of the paper shows it wasn't 97 percent it was 0.3 percent of the
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:45.360]  abstracts that actually agreed with that consensus so they're still fiddling everything they can
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:51.360]  fiddle but the temperature is not rising as fast as they wanted it to in fact it's not really rising
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:57.120]  at all sea level for the last eight years has been rising at a rate equivalent to less than
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:05.040]  two inches a century so frankly the scare is now over will somebody please tell the democrats
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:09.920]  absolutely you know we went to they had the american meteorological society had their meeting here
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:13.920]  in austin this year and we covered it for info wars and it was pretty amazing to see just as
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:19.440]  you talked about they love to do things like appeal to authority or appeal to the fact that
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:23.840]  they have this many scientists from this prestigious university who sign on to their theory and it's
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:29.840]  like show me the data show me the facts and you've got a great presentation where you basically go
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:34.000]  through and you look at it it's a very we just had that up on the screen there if you look at
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:40.800]  temperatures uh there is quite a noisy graph and you have to draw a trend line through that to take
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:45.600]  a you know sample of it i mean we have uh the temperature variation is all over the place
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:51.200]  but when you honestly draw the trend line through it you see that it is there is no global warming
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:56.400]  going on you do a great job of pointing that out in your presentations well that's very kind of you
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:04.080]  in fact i'm now doing a monthly graph which shows the predictions which the u n's climate panel for
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:10.720]  which i'm an expert reviewer is about to make it's just in a couple of months time they'll be producing
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:17.360]  their fifth of their five-yearly multi-thousand page collections of scientific rubbish about
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:22.800]  global warming and in in that particular document that's just about to come out which of course i've
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:30.560]  read because i reviewed it for them they have made predictions about how fast the world should be
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:37.040]  warming at the moment and it should be warming at a rate equivalent to about two and a third
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:45.040]  celsius degrees or kind of five to six fahrenheit degrees every century but in fact it's not doing
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:51.040]  that it's not warming at all so they've got a big problem and what i'm doing every month now
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:56.720]  is publishing the latest monthly temperature record from the satellites of the university of
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:02.000]  alabama at huntsville and remote sensing systems and i take the average of those and plot the graph
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.440]  then i calculate the trend line there's a standard statistical formula that i use for doing that
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:12.000]  and it is at the moment declining very slightly it's not really a significant decline but it is
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:18.320]  declining whereas the forecast temperatures of course are heading upwards because they've just
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:25.200]  predicted that are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will have about twice as much effect
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.400]  on the temperatures as in fact it has been having over the last 50 years and with the sun
[02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:37.440]  now going into something of a hissy fit it's gone into decline really it's beginning to look as though
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:43.040]  the real worry is going to be about whether we're going to get global cooling in the next couple of
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:49.120]  years certainly and possibly even for the next couple of decades that's right as many meteorologists
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:54.160]  and other scientists have pointed out and as common sense would dictate the thing that really
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:59.440]  drives the weather and global warming is solar activity you know that's the thing that really
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.760]  correlates to it one of the things we noticed at the meteorological societies meeting was that
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.720]  meteorologists are very much interested in doing exactly what you're doing and that is
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:14.480]  taking a lot of measurements and they were distinguished from the climatologists because
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:17.760]  you know the meteorologists they're looking at short-term predictions so they're going out and
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.240]  they're taking measurements here measurements there and then they're testing that against their
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:27.360]  models climatologists on the other hand they're looking at such long-term scale that they can go
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:33.680]  out and they can create these open-ended models which of course they can't really test or verify
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:39.200]  right well we can't really test or verify like you to think that wouldn't they but they do also
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:45.280]  make medium-term predictions over the next 30 or 40 years and it's those medium-term predictions
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.000]  that i'm testing they are saying that over those 40 years there'll be a more or less
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.680]  straight line increase in global temperatures at a rate equivalent if it carried on for 100 years
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:04.880]  to 2.33 celsius degrees that's their central estimate now that we can test is it or is it not
[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:11.680]  rising at a rate equivalent to 2.33 celsius per century now the answer is that it never has done
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:18.960]  that ever since we've been taking records back since 1850 we've been doing it in the UK compiling
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:28.320]  a global temperature record and the fastest rate of warming since 1850 occurred between roughly 1974
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:35.280]  and 2006 if you take the trend on that period then the rate is about two celsius per century
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:43.200]  equivalent but of course if you take the period from shall we say 1996 until the present then in
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.840]  fact you've got either a flat line or you've got if anything a slight decline in temperature
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:54.480]  the the the truth is that it is no longer warming as they had predicted and they do not know why
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:59.760]  but of course anyone who has done what you have done and what the meteorologists at the
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:05.920]  american meteorological society have done and you look at the changes in the activity of the sun
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:11.440]  over the last hundreds of years or tens of years it doesn't matter what period it's the sun that's
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:18.320]  the major influence and very interestingly in Hamburg just a few months ago a Dr Murray Salby
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:24.480]  who's the professor of climate sciences at Macquarie University in Sydney or rather he was
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:31.280]  until his results became so inconvenient that they fired him for no good reason that anyone can see
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:39.840]  he came out with a very interesting finding that if you take not just the day-to-day fluctuations of
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:45.840]  the sun but you take what's called the time integral of the sun that means you kind of add up
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:51.440]  how much extra heat the sun is pouring in or how much extra heat it isn't pouring in and you look
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:55.200]  at it as a kind of bucket if you like where you're pouring in heat at the top and then
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:18:00.160]  heat's going back out to outer space or into the sea at the other direction and he said if you take
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:06.960]  that time integral as it's called then solar activity really explains just about all of the
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:12.800]  warming and cooling that we've seen over various periods going back 10,000 years or just going
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:17.840]  back over the last few dozens of years doesn't matter what period you take absolutely and he's
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:25.280]  used a real rocket science mathematical technique called Fourier analysis to do this and interestingly
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:32.160]  there are others in Australia and elsewhere now doing the same analysis without realizing
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:37.040]  that he's already working on it as well well you know what you're going to find is a series of papers
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:43.280]  coming out in the peer-reviewed literature over the next few years really more or less proving
[02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:48.480]  that it is the sun that's chiefly responsible for fluctuations in global temperature and that CO2
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:53.760]  at best is a bit part player absolutely now we've talked a lot about the science but when we come
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:59.120]  back from the break I want to go over the economic consequences for people because you know this is
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:04.320]  not just an academic or scientific debate we could have that debate and it would be very interesting
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:08.560]  but this is something that has real world consequences we're talking about something as
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:14.160]  you've pointed out that's a third of the global GDP that's being proposed for these carbon taxes
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:18.640]  it's amazing transfer of wealth the largest transfer of wealth to private individuals
[02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.560]  that we've ever seen this is something a scam that is very similar in my opinion
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:27.920]  to the Federal Reserve scam that we have here with our central bank but on a far larger scale on a
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.880]  global scale that affects everyone on the planet especially those of us in the western countries
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:37.280]  from which they want to transfer the wealth so we want to cover that in the very next segment I
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:42.560]  want to talk about the real dollars and cents effect of this and how it's going to affect
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:47.280]  everyone and why you should be concerned about this global warming debate why you should also
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:51.040]  be armed with the science as Lord Moncton has pointed out so you can have this debate so they
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:56.880]  can form politicians and your neighbors about what the scam is really about we'll be right back stay

[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:26.720]  here filling in for alex jones and we have live on the phone lord chrisper mongton
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:31.840]  and no this is not the end in spite of what the climate alarmist want to tell us this is not the
[02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:38.000]  end and we've been talking about the bad science and some of the issues with the data that's been
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.440]  given to people that policy is actually being based on with lord chrisper mongton but in this
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:48.720]  segment i want to talk about the real dollars and cents consequences about this and not only
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:54.000]  just dollars and cents but real life consequences you know we're all told that everything is going
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.760]  to melt and all the cities are going to be overrun with water and so this is a matter of life and
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:02.720]  death well you know it really is a matter of life and death when you can't have access to cheap power
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:11.120]  it is the access to energy available affordable access to energy is the best predictor of life
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:18.000]  expectancy as well as just creature comforts lord mongton can you lay this out for the audience
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.200]  exactly what's at stake here in terms of global governance in terms of this massive transfer
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:30.160]  of wealth that is being proposed with these carbon taxes yes this is the biggest transfer of wealth
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:37.200]  in human history from the poor to the rich from the little guy to the big guy from the governed
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:44.400]  to those who govern them and it's a kind of robin hood in reverse there is no scientific basis for
[02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:52.000]  it and there's no economic basis for it either and what i'd like to do is just take as an example
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:59.360]  the sander's boxer proposed carbon tax they failed to get cap and trade through they couldn't get that
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:07.200]  through the congress now they're trying to flog this dead horse by rebranding it as a carbon tax
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:12.800]  rather like the one in australia but here are the figures on this and if you've got a pencil and
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:18.640]  paper handy you might like to write these down because they they are all mainstream science
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:24.000]  mainstream figures straight from the u.s climate panel straight from sanders and boxer themselves
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.440]  i am not making any of these figures up i'm just drawing from these figures the conclusions that
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.880]  they should have drawn if they had known enough climatology and economics to understand how
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:42.640]  daft their proposal is so here goes they're going to cut carbon dioxide emissions in the united
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:48.720]  states with this tax if they get away with it which they won't but let's pretend by 11 percent
[02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:54.400]  over 10 years that's over and above the amount at which it's falling anyway because more and more
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:27:03.520]  people are burning cheap gas to deliver their power and gas emits half the amount of co2 per
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:11.840]  btu delivered as coal so that's why in the us in fact carbon dioxide emissions almost uniquely in the
[02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:16.800]  western world have been falling more or less throughout the last decade or so but anyway
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:23.360]  they're saying they're going to increase that rate of fall by 10.9 percent but the point is
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:31.360]  that the us only accounts for 17 and a half percent of all global carbon emissions so even if the
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:37.920]  sanders boxer tax were to succeed as they wanted to and they really have no scientific or economic
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:44.880]  basis for assuming that it will then less than two percent of global co2 emissions would be
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:52.560]  remitted over that 10 year period that in turn would reduce the co2 concentration which the
[02:27:52.560 --> 02:28:00.160]  un's climate panel would expect to be 422 parts per million by volume that would reduce it to
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:10.720]  from 422 to 421.5 so not much of a change there that in turn means that the co2 radiative forcing
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:20.160]  which is the effect which eventually causes warming would fall by 0.006 watts per square meter
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:26.000]  we wouldn't be able to measure it that in turn means that the projected business as usual
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:34.400]  anthropogenic forcing which would have been 0.467 watts per square meter will come down
[02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:43.440]  by only 1.3 percent so you can hardly measure any of this and that means that the cost of abating
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:50.480]  all of the radiative forcing that that would happen worldwide over the 10 year period of the
[02:28:50.480 --> 02:28:58.080]  tax from now until 2023 if everyone worldwide adopted the sanders boxer tax and you use that to
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:07.040]  try to stop global warming that would mean it would cost 11.5 percent of global GDP so 11 and
[02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:12.160]  a half percent of everything we make and sell just to reduce the amount of warming that would
[02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:17.440]  otherwise happen over the next 10 years. Well we're not going to feel that change in climate
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:22.240]  but we certainly are going to feel that change in our lifestyle in terms of the amount of money
[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:27.360]  that we have that is going to be massive. Here's the full absurdity of it. Well we're going to cover
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:30.400]  that we've got a break coming up we'll get right back to that we're going to talk about that we're
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:36.080]  going to talk about methane levels the trans-russian pipeline and as you put it Lord Moncton gas
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:52.400]  Putin we'll talk about all that coming up in the next segment. We're on the march the empires on

[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:27.120]  line lord christopher moctin and we're talking about global warming now the global warming
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:33.520]  people who advocate that this is being caused by man-made co2 and not by changes in solar activity
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:40.560]  those people call us skeptics we call them alarmists and you know a skeptic is someone
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:45.680]  who is going to say uh prove it to me and that's basically the way science has always worked
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:51.040]  show me the data and that's exactly what we're talking about the data that they're showing us
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:57.520]  is data that has been cooked that has been fudge that has been cherry picked but you know they're
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:04.480]  joining that with a compliant media and that's one of the things that you should check out state
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:09.760]  of mind the documentary is at info wars dot com you can also buy it at info wars store dot com
[02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:17.680]  and that will explain to you exactly how the schools are a large part of bringing the population
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:24.160]  a long line of whatever catastrophe the government is pushing at any given moment to try to expand
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:32.160]  its power to expand its reach and this global warming alarmism is actually a way of expanding
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:37.440]  global governance and transferring wealth and we were just talking to lord mocton about that
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:42.720]  transfer wealth lord mocton can we put a dollar figure on this what's this going to cost per
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:49.920]  person i saw you covered that on one of your presentations well that's right it is very very
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:56.160]  expensive indeed i mean if we just take this this carbon tax i mean that's going to cost
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:02.240]  even if the warming happens at the rate they predict and even if it costs as much to make it
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:10.000]  go away as they predict it's going to cost 13 000 per head but you see you have to multiply that
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:14.720]  by about three because the warming isn't happening at the rate they predict so you're really looking
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:22.400]  at getting on for 40 000 per head just over the next 10 years and that's per head of the entire
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:30.480]  global population now where is a starving person in africa or asia or south america going to find
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:35.360]  40 000 dollars from where's an american where's an american going to find that that's where
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:40.160]  that's where you had a family of four you know you know the streets of austin texas are paved with
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:44.960]  gold everybody else did vectors kind of four four thousand dollars over the next 10 years but nobody
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:51.680]  else can and so of course this is this is the extravagant absurdity of all this and the figures
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:58.880]  i've just run through with you which show that even if the warming were going to happen at the rate
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:04.240]  that they say and even if that would do as much damage as they say and even if it would cost as
[02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:10.000]  much to make that damage go away as they say or just to adapt to it as they say then it would
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:18.800]  be eight times more expensive to try to stop the global warming today with measures of equivalent
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:26.080]  cost effectiveness to the sanders boxer proposed tax as it would be simply to let it happen sit back
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:32.960]  enjoy the sunshine and pay the later and far lesser cost of adapting to such of its consequences
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:38.560]  as might be adverse right now the government always tries to do a crisis you know they're always
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:44.640]  looking for crises to do things as you pointed out if there is a crisis the fact is that it by the
[02:36:44.640 --> 02:36:49.920]  time you've allowed for the fact that it isn't happening at the rate they say it's happening at
[02:36:49.920 --> 02:36:54.800]  about one third of the rate they say in the last 15 years not even at all if you allow for that
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:37:03.920]  then it's 20 times and i'm not talking about 20 percent it's 20 times more expensive to have sanders
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:10.560]  boxer taxes worldwide to stop the global warming happening than it is just to let it happen and
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:16.800]  pay the cost of letting it happen and adapting to its adverse consequences even if it's going to happen
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:24.000]  if the consequences are as expensive to deal with as they're trying to say they are that's how absurd
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:29.840]  these numbers are yes this is mainstream economics it's mainstream calculations
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:35.440]  mainstream climatology none of this is acting on assumptions other than the assumptions
[02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:41.120]  that they themselves are using and they just haven't bothered to do the math because as you
[02:37:41.120 --> 02:37:47.440]  rightly said earlier this is another federal reserve scam it's not about addressing global warming
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:54.000]  it is about making the rich even richer while the poor get even poorer and you and i are against that
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.560]  that's right you know it's like i said they always like to use a crisis to move things along
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:03.040]  that's what they did with a tarp bailout they pulled in a lot of congressmen and senators and
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:07.600]  said look you need to give this massive amount of money to the banks right away or there's going
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:10.720]  to be riding the streets we've got a lot of mortgages that are underwater we need to help
[02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:15.760]  these people that money never left the banks uh no that stuff happened so they're basically trying
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:20.560]  to create a crisis they want to if they if they don't have a crisis that they can use for their
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.520]  purposes they'll manufacture a crisis and that's what we see happening here talk a little bit about
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:29.920]  climate gait you know i'm i'm sure you're aware of what happened there at east anglia university
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:35.600]  we had a revelation of some data i believe it was in 2009 we had uh a thousand emails leaked
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:39.680]  and basically they were talking about hiding the data and then it was repeated again a couple
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:46.480]  years later we had i think it was 2011 we had five thousand emails leaked i was part of a team
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:52.960]  that was trying to get uh access to michael man's emails at the university of virginia because a lot
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:57.680]  of those emails were back and forth to michael man but uh so far that we've not been able to
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:04.000]  to get access to that they've hidden those why are they hiding that data well they're hiding the data
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:11.200]  and they're hiding the emails because the emails that have become public show that a small malevolent
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:19.440]  clique of bad scientists on the very far left politically such as michael man were deliberately
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:27.440]  tampering with the data destroying data fiddling their results so as to pretend that it was a whole
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:35.840]  lot uh warmer today than it was a thousand years ago when very nearly all the papers in the scientific
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:41.280]  literature that have done this by reference to actual measurement which you were talking of earlier
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:46.800]  rather than playing around with models as michael man did those papers that do it by measurement
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:52.240]  show that it was very likely a great deal warmer a thousand years ago two thousand years ago four
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:58.160]  thousand years ago and also between six thousand and ten thousand years ago than it is today so
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:06.480]  today's temperatures are not exceptional and they had to uh change that in fact in 1995 ken
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:11.680]  overpeck one of the people who features in these emails and one of the bad scientists who've been
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:19.440]  bending the data uh wrote to a good scientist from whom i got the story and he said we have to
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:24.560]  abolish the medieval warm period not we have to check whether it was there or how big it was
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:29.840]  whether well no we have to abolish it and so they did that was the significance of michael
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:36.960]  man's graph and then somebody at the university of east anglia was so horrified by this that they
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:42.880]  released all the emails going back ten years uh between the university of east anglia and these
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:49.440]  other scientists all over the world to the bbc but of course the bbc is in the tank for this
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:55.920]  garbage oh yeah pecking fund is heavily invested in so-called green so-called investments and so
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:01.520]  it wasn't going to release these and the person in the bbc who sent it was sent this data these
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:06.000]  these emails it was one of their environment correspondence didn't do anything with it he
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:12.960]  sat on it and so eventually the emails were released via a russian website and then uh the
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:18.000]  police went around bullying they didn't dare try to bully me but they did bully some of my friends
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:24.160]  here in the uk to find out whether we had anything to do with what they were calling the theft of
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:31.360]  these emails but hang on this wasn't theft these were paid scientists at public institutions
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:37.040]  chiefly in the united states and britain we are the taxpayers we pay for them to do this research
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:41.840]  and talk to each other about it and so these emails along with all their results and their
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:47.920]  data and their models ought to be public property exactly exactly that's our point i was at the
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:53.200]  american tradition institute and the people there ken kuchinelli the attorney general in virginia
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:59.040]  and others were saying this these are emails that were that were conducted by michael man
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:05.760]  as he was employed by the university of virginia at taxpayer expense producing information and
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:12.720]  so-called science that is now forming the basis of policy so we need to be able to have full
[02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:17.040]  transparency full disclosure and yet what we see coming out of that is the same thing we're seeing
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:22.160]  with the snowden leaks rather than rather than going after it and looking at it and saying okay
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.880]  what is this leaked data showing us you know is there something dishonest criminal going on here
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:32.320]  is there a conspiracy going on here instead of looking at that they attack snowden they say
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.880]  how did these leaks come up and as you mentioned instead of looking at the actual data and saying
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:43.600]  these people are conspiring to craft a story to suit themselves or cherry picking the data
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:48.000]  rather than do that they want to know where that leak come from that's that's the extraordinary
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:52.320]  thing i mean i've written to the police a couple of times about this and said look there's fraud
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:58.160]  going on here and it's going on an enormous scale and it's not a matter of scientific debate they
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:04.160]  are tampering with the evidence i've given them a couple of very clear examples of where the evidence
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:09.840]  has been deliberately bent and ken kuccinelli is being very slow off the mark here he is still
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:15.040]  faffing around trying to get emails which man is never going to deliver and the university
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:19.280]  won't either because once this fraud comes out in public they're all going to go down the university
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.320]  of virginia it's going to get closed down as his pen states they'll close the whole university down
[02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:29.600]  because they've tried to cover up this fraud but that's what it is that's right simply bogus science
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:38.800]  that's right ken kuccinelli has if he did but understand it enough evidence already to convict
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:45.200]  those who were responsible for and i'm going to use this word bluntly fabricating that bogus hockey
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:52.560]  stick graph that graph is a fraud and it is relatively easy to prove that it's a fraud
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:58.800]  and i've often done this in front of audiences to see how they react if and these are just lay
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:04.000]  audiences and you say right here's the evidence here is what they did now if you were a jury
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:10.800]  and they did this would you convict them of fraud and the answer is yes the jury would convict them
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:16.000]  of fraud and so kuccinelli if he wanted because he is a state's attorney generally has a certain
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:22.320]  amount of credibility if he was simply to bring a prosecution against those who fabricated that
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:29.600]  graph then i can put him in touch with scientists who have done detailed analyses far beyond anything
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:35.440]  that i would be capable of doing expert scientists in this field who will be able to demonstrate to
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:45.200]  him exactly how this was done by whom it was done and why it is fraudulent and so i just hope that he
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:52.560]  will do the sensible thing and just go in front of a grand jury put these scientists i can put
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:57.280]  him in touch with on the witness stand and say to them right tell us what's been going on the
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:03.440]  grand jury will be as horrified as i was when i sat down with the experts concerned and they told
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:10.560]  me how it had been done it was and is a standing outrage and it is i think only a matter of time
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:17.120]  and if if ken kuccinelli hasn't got the what in english we should call the cojones to do this
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:21.520]  then i think we're going to have to find another state's attorney general who is willing to bring
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:28.560]  these people to book but one shouldn't home in only on them this is a widespread and connected
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:34.880]  series of major frauds and the climategate emails are the index to who is involved and what they've
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:42.880]  been up to and frankly if i were a wealthier man and had more time to devote to this i would have
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:48.560]  a lot of these people in court and just say right this is a fraud the police will not do anything
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:53.760]  our serious fraud office i've written to them they don't even write back they just get an
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:57.840]  automated acknowledgement saying they're not interested in investigating serious fraud if it's
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:02.400]  the government that's doing it absolutely the best of the private sector and it's just another
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:06.640]  it's just another measurement of the widespread corruption in government that people can get
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:12.560]  caught red handed you know with these conspiring to deceive the public being caught red handed
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:16.080]  with the way that they're as you've pointed out in your presentations the way they cherry
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:20.480]  picked the starting points to kind of get the trend analysis that they want they very carefully
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:25.520]  choose it you have a great example of a sine wave and you say well if i just look at this one
[02:46:25.520 --> 02:46:30.640]  portion of a sine wave i can make it look as if everything is declining or every pick another portion
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:36.080]  everything is increasing so you know if you cherry picked the data which is what this climategate
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:41.680]  stuff was all about emails back and forth to each other to hide the decline if you look at the text
[02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:46.400]  just from the very first one and alex is on this from the very beginning but he's kind of as we
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:52.000]  showed this um these old articles with alex standing in front of a blackboard of the video
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:57.600]  he was on it from the very beginning but the mainstream media was like i said compliant with
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:02.400]  this story because why because it grows the government and because any fraud as you pointed
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:06.160]  out that's done by the government is something that we really shouldn't look at we didn't just
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:10.640]  move along there's no story here that's right i mean in fact when i worked at 10 Downing Street
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:16.240]  i found this kind of corruption going on and i made sure that possibly was where i could do
[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:21.200]  something about it people who tried that on did not get away with it i investigated several
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:25.920]  scientific frauds that were going on at that time and had them stopped because the lies
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:31.680]  didn't work they tried lying even to Downing Street but it didn't work and the trouble is that in
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:37.120]  government now there are too few people who have any understanding of elementary mathematics or
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:42.400]  science that's true there were the senators having this big inquiry but none of those senators i've
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:47.760]  spoken to some of them they're all good people but none of them simply has enough of a scientific
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:54.400]  background to realize just what a monstrosity this global warming story is on three major fronts
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:48:02.160]  first of all even in theory we wouldn't expect to see all that much in the way of global warming
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:07.760]  secondly actually it hasn't been occurring at anything like the rate that they've been predicting
[02:48:07.760 --> 02:48:15.040]  and thirdly even if it did it's economically 10 to 100 times cheaper to let it happen and adapt to
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:20.960]  its adverse consequences than it is to do anything about it those are the hard simple central facts
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:27.280]  of this debate and it's just regrettable that there are too few politicians who really understand
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:32.800]  enough science and enough economics to be able to put the two together and realize just what a
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:38.800]  fantasy and an absurdity all of this is but here's the exciting bit and i've said this to Alex i'll
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:45.360]  say it to you that they've the left which now controls governments worldwide it controls civil
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:51.920]  services it controls the supreme court it controls of course the media virtually wall to wall oh yeah
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:49:00.320]  they have made what is going to have proven to be a heroic strategic mistake by nailing their
[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:08.480]  red flag to the mast of the sinking ship global warming and that rising sea level that they are
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:15.360]  seeing is not the sea rising it's the good ship global warming sinking beneath them because the
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:22.640]  science in the end cannot be controverted either it is going to warm at the rate that they predicted
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:28.160]  or it is not those of us who have done the sums properly know that it isn't happening we know
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:32.480]  that it isn't going to happen we know why it isn't going to happen and we know that even if it did
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:36.480]  happen you'd be better off not doing anything about it and spending the money more usefully
[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:43.680]  somewhere else so we will not be surprised but a lot of the fellow travelers on the left who once
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:49.840]  they are told the party line will parrot it without ever questioning whether it was right or wrong
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:55.600]  are suddenly going to get a shock because you see in most matters of politics what happens is the
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:00.160]  unit you can argue it one way or the other but on matters of science it's not like that
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:07.120]  there is truth and there is everything else and in truth this global warming scare is a lie it's
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:13.440]  the greatest lie ever told as professor niclas mohner calls it it's a very big very costly lie
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:19.120]  which is hugely beneficial to the governing class in most parts of the world it's hugely damaging
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:24.080]  to the working class and the poorer classes in all parts of the world particularly in the very
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:29.200]  poorest countries who are not being allowed to develop the cheap fossil fuel electricity
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:34.640]  which is the fastest way of lifting them out of poverty absolutely the fastest way of stabilizing
[02:50:34.640 --> 02:50:40.240]  their populations absolutely and it's a it's a propaganda it's an information war it's a propaganda
[02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:44.560]  war because even though they know this and even though we can tell people this it's really who
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:50.000]  can repeat a lie the most times can can actually deceive the public so we're going to talk a
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.280]  little bit more about this we've got one more segment with lord christ for mocton so stay

[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:22.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night filling in for alex jones and we have
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:28.960]  lord christopher montan on the phone from england and he's been talking to us about this fraud being
[02:54:28.960 --> 02:54:36.400]  perpetrated on the public on the world called global warming and the supposed solution carbon
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:42.000]  taxes or cap and trade or whatever they come up with at the moment to transfer wealth from us to a
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:48.560]  few people now we were just uh lord montan we were as i was pointing out we went to the american
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:54.960]  meteorological society one of the things that really struck me was the information war that's
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:55:00.080]  being conducted there there was one group that was uh soros funded and they were there and they
[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:05.120]  were trying to convince meteorologists that they had first of all they had graphs up and it's like
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:09.760]  you know who who do you believe uh on global warming and of course they believe meteorologists
[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:16.720]  so they were trying to convince meteorologists to be propagandists for their point of view
[02:55:16.720 --> 02:55:22.880]  and what they were doing was appealing to the authority of people with degrees at prestigious
[02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:29.840]  institutes or to the number of scientists that agreed with their position but of course we've had
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:35.520]  countless instances throughout history where the majority of prestigious scientists agreed about
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:40.640]  something and were totally wrong yes it was one that i mentioned in the u.s congress where i was
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:47.200]  giving testimony there a few years ago and uh i think it was uh henry waxman said to me he said
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:54.240]  at the end of the year he said i really prefer to follow isaac newton and i said but he got it
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:56:01.440]  wrong at the margin and einstein corrected him so you shouldn't just believe in a consensus
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:11.840]  however eminent in fact the argument from consensus was condemned 2 350 years ago by aristotle as being
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:19.120]  a bogus argument a logical fallacy exactly condemned again by the founder of the scientific method
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:24.720]  abu ali ibn al-hasan ibn al-hussain ibn al-hussain ibn al-haytham he was as proud of his lineage
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:30.000]  as i am of mine in 11th century iraq who said that the seeker after truth that was his beautiful
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:35.760]  phrase for the scientist doesn't put his faith in any mere consensus instead he checks and checks
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:40.880]  and checks again because the road to the truth said al-haytham is long and hard and that's the
[02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:45.920]  road we must follow and just looking up to see who's got a phd doesn't actually tell you whether
[02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:51.440]  that phd is telling the truth because that's another logical fallacy it's the fallacy of
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:57.280]  argument from reputation the argumentum and kundiam as the medieval schoolmen were later to call it
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:03.520]  so all of these arguments they're using are logical fallacies now why then are they getting away
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:09.680]  with it the answer is because they very carefully destroyed the education system first yeah middle
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:16.480]  ages until my own generation and i was the last we were taught not only grammar but also logic
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:23.360]  we were taught to recognize bogus arguments like those the left now trot out routinely to recognize
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:30.640]  them five miles off all of the major arguments in favor of the global warming scare are logical
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:36.000]  fallacies condemned as such and listed as such by Aristotle two thousand three hundred fifty years
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:42.720]  ago but most people don't know this most of the left don't know it they have so destroyed the
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:47.440]  education system they themselves are not properly educated exactly along those lines you're talking
[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:52.160]  about how most of the congressman can't understand how to look at a uh at a chart with a that's pretty
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:56.800]  noisy and draw a trend line through it honestly so if they're you know they've taken that down and
[02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:01.360]  at the same time they have created this kind of edward bernay's propaganda this bf skinner
[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:06.640]  propaganda in the school so that people follow whatever the authorities tell them what is interesting
[02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:11.600]  is that the school kids who are always by nature rebellious at least i assume they are because i
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:17.680]  always was i think that they are beginning to break away from this they are beginning to smell
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:23.280]  that the propaganda is just too hysterical too one-sided and that doesn't work with kids if you
[02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:28.720]  want to propagandize them yet be more subtle than that yeah and these people are now so desperate
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:34.640]  that they're just telling lie upon lie upon lie on top of lie upon lie upon lie absolutely working
[02:58:34.640 --> 02:58:39.840]  but people we're out of time lord montan thank you for pointing out the truth and keep it up well
[02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:45.520]  we will hear as well thank you very much well god bless you i'll be impacted alec not too long
