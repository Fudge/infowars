[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:32.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.880 --> 00:39.640]  ladies and gentlemen this is one of those major sea change moments that we're
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.880]  witnessing up in Missouri at Missouri State University system where feminist
[00:44.880 --> 00:52.320]  professors are commanding throngs of uptight chip on the shoulder in my
[00:52.320 --> 00:58.000]  view mentally ill people chasing imaginary phantoms of oppression and
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.680]  discrimination while all Americans are having our basic freedoms dismantled
[01:02.680 --> 01:10.060]  this is pure social disorder by design this is pure divide and conquer and we
[01:10.060 --> 01:15.840]  now have videos of them attacking pushing shoving and threatening reporters
[01:15.840 --> 01:26.600]  that are members of the university that are students and who are minorities this
[01:26.600 --> 01:30.040]  is scary but first the debate's coming up tonight remember the route a few weeks
[01:30.040 --> 01:34.080]  ago on the CNBC debate here's some of the highlights of the skewed questions
[01:34.080 --> 01:37.280]  will we see that tonight from the Fox debate
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.680]  live from the University of Colorado in Boulder the Republican presidential
[01:43.680 --> 01:50.080]  debate mr. Trump yes you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising
[01:50.080 --> 01:53.680]  to build a wall and make another country pay for it right send 11 million
[01:53.680 --> 01:59.200]  people out of the country cut taxes 10 trillion dollars without increasing the
[01:59.200 --> 02:04.040]  deficit right and make Americans better off because your greatness would replace
[02:04.040 --> 02:09.840]  the stupidity and incompetence of others that's right let's be honest is this a
[02:09.840 --> 02:13.320]  comic book version of a presidential campaign a comic book and it's not a
[02:13.320 --> 02:17.320]  very nicely as questioned the way you say that when they say you act like you
[02:17.320 --> 02:20.960]  hate your job do you this is another example of the double standard that
[02:20.960 --> 02:23.960]  exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative
[02:23.960 --> 02:30.480]  the questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the
[02:30.480 --> 02:40.240]  American people don't trust the media this is not a cage match and you look
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.280]  at the questions Donald Trump are you a comic book villain Ben Carson can you do
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.920]  math John Kasich will you insult two people over here Marco Rubio why don't
[02:48.920 --> 02:53.200]  you resign Jeb Bush why have your numbers fallen how about talking about the
[02:53.200 --> 02:58.560]  substantive issues they paid seven million dollars to settle a deceptive
[02:58.560 --> 03:04.440]  marketing lawsuit in Texas and yet your involvement continued why well that's
[03:04.440 --> 03:07.840]  easy to answer I didn't have an involvement with them that is total
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.000]  propaganda to be fair you were on the homepage of their website with the logo
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.440]  over your shoulder if somebody put me on the homepage they did it without my
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.600]  permission does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way
[03:19.600 --> 03:30.800]  you know it speaks to the fact that I don't know those they know you have been
[03:30.800 --> 03:34.000]  very critical of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who has wanted to increase the
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.520]  number of these H1B is not at all critical of him where did I read this and
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.040]  come up with this that you were probably I don't know you people write this stuff
[03:42.040 --> 03:47.560]  I don't know where Governor Huckabee you've written about the huge divide in
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.400]  values between middle America and the big coastal cities like New York and
[03:51.400 --> 03:55.680]  Los Angeles as a preacher as well as a politician you know that presidents need
[03:55.680 --> 04:00.560]  the moral authority to bring the entire country together the leading Republican
[04:00.560 --> 04:03.640]  candidate when you look at the average of national polls right now is Donald
[04:03.640 --> 04:07.480]  Trump when you look at him do you see someone with the moral authority to
[04:07.480 --> 04:15.080]  unite the country you know there's few questions I've got the last one I need
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.560]  is to give him some more time I love Donald Trump he is a good man I'm
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.120]  wearing a Trump tie tonight Governor Bush daily fantasy sports has become a
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.080]  phenomenon in this country will award billions of dollars in prize money this
[04:28.080 --> 04:33.240]  year but to play you have to assess your odds put money at risk wait for an
[04:33.240 --> 04:36.960]  outcome that's out of your control isn't that the definition of gambling and
[04:36.960 --> 04:41.200]  should the federal government treat it as such well first of all I'm seven and
[04:41.200 --> 04:47.680]  oh in my fantasy football league we're going to go to break their Christie gets
[04:47.680 --> 04:51.400]  upset this is why we're talking about fantasy football this is a big broadcast
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.720]  lined up the political correctness has now reached boiling point we'll break it
[04:55.720 --> 05:02.240]  all down the other side a proposed EU law puts the simple act of linking to
[05:02.240 --> 05:07.120]  content under copyright protection Julia Reda a German activist puts it this
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.760]  way the European Commission is preparing a frontal attack on the hyperlink the
[05:11.760 --> 05:16.720]  basic building block of the internet as we know it this is based on an absurd
[05:16.720 --> 05:22.320]  idea that just won't die making search engines and news portals pay media
[05:22.320 --> 05:26.680]  companies for promoting their freely accessible articles redis cites a
[05:26.680 --> 05:31.180]  drought communication on copyright reform leaked last week the ideas
[05:31.180 --> 05:35.440]  expressed by the document challenge the existing interpretation and spirit of a
[05:35.440 --> 05:40.240]  law as well as common sense each web link would become a legal landmine and
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.440]  would allow press publishers to hold every single actor on the internet
[05:44.440 --> 05:49.000]  liable she went on to explain reda believes the EU will try to slide this

[08:08.600 --> 08:18.520]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's alex Jones so the mazoo state
[08:18.520 --> 08:23.400]  system of four colleges has been known as the Bastion in the Midwest a political
[08:23.400 --> 08:28.240]  correctness bowing to all of it the first openly gay football player large
[08:28.240 --> 08:34.520]  portion minority students and generous scholarships the president has groveled
[08:34.520 --> 08:38.920]  and apologized for his great evils and resigned for doing nothing the
[08:38.920 --> 08:44.280]  chancellor has resigned and this is the new beginning of what you would call the
[08:44.280 --> 08:48.880]  red terror this is how communists take over different countries is you get
[08:48.880 --> 08:54.400]  different groups of professors directing the young adults who really have no
[08:54.400 --> 08:58.880]  future under the system to have chips on their shoulders to be upset about
[08:58.880 --> 09:04.120]  phantom menaces and to demand resignations and to demand that that
[09:04.120 --> 09:10.800]  schools adopt whatever new political correctness is the flavor du jour or the
[09:10.800 --> 09:19.120]  cause du jour or the cause the lab of the moment this is true bullying and true
[09:19.120 --> 09:26.040]  Salem witch trials at its best and this was the high-tech political lynching to
[09:26.040 --> 09:31.360]  steal a term from Clarence Thomas Supreme Court justice against the school
[09:31.360 --> 09:37.880]  and and sets a precedent of George Soros style destabilization and we know
[09:37.880 --> 09:42.600]  Soros connected groups are involved with I sat back last night and this morning
[09:42.600 --> 09:48.040]  and watched a bunch of raw videos over an hour of it shot by the people inside
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.560]  the encampment that's taken over commons area and also without and it didn't
[09:53.560 --> 09:57.600]  matter if you were a Chinese student didn't matter if you were a black student
[09:57.600 --> 10:02.400]  a white student if you were just seen with a camera getting anywhere near the
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.880]  commons area taken over mobs of people who come over and start attacking you
[10:06.880 --> 10:11.160]  directed by professors who were heard yelling on the video and we're going to
[10:11.160 --> 10:20.040]  play the video coming up a Melissa click assistant professor of mass media
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.200]  pushing and attacking the camera and then yelling get me muscle you could
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.760]  imagine a re-education camp type situation with these people if you
[10:30.760 --> 10:34.800]  imagine being in a re-education camp directed by folks like this then and
[10:34.800 --> 10:39.200]  that's what the public schools are the colleges and other facilities are giant
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.280]  re-education camps in the globalist own social engineering works remember the
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.200]  new army manual that got leaked three years ago admitted that they've been
[10:48.200 --> 10:52.480]  directed to set up civilian inmate labor camps for political dissidents where
[10:52.480 --> 10:58.920]  they will be quote re-educated just type in army manual mentions re-education
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.080]  camps in full wars calm we have the articles the snippets and the links to
[11:03.080 --> 11:10.520]  army dot mill army dot mill uses the term re-education camp for America I said
[11:10.520 --> 11:15.160]  yesterday the professors are getting kicked out that the the the president
[11:15.160 --> 11:24.840]  has been kicked out or resigned for the crime of being white and this is the
[11:24.840 --> 11:30.720]  hysteria that is being created the crowd of being white and being male in all of
[11:30.720 --> 11:37.800]  these videos if you see who is commanding the young mindless adults who
[11:37.800 --> 11:43.360]  are giggling and laughing and having a mindless raw gang member exercise of
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.640]  power you will notice it is feminist professors and we've already looked up
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.240]  three of them are working on an article right now identifying their writings and
[11:52.240 --> 11:58.720]  what they stand for but when I was growing up 13 14 15 I wasn't really in a
[11:58.720 --> 12:05.680]  gang but when me and my friends were out anywhere in the city in Dallas every
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.400]  week sometimes a couple times a week people would jump out of cars or run up
[12:10.400 --> 12:14.560]  and say this is our neighborhood we're get ready to fight we would just fight
[12:14.560 --> 12:18.680]  and sometimes it was redneck sometimes it was black guys sometimes a lot of
[12:18.680 --> 12:24.960]  times it was racial and in my experience I always got to enjoy it being racial
[12:24.960 --> 12:29.040]  from the minorities against me because I was white I mean I'll guarantee you most
[12:29.040 --> 12:32.280]  black folks out there haven't been in a bunch of knockdown dragouts with white
[12:32.280 --> 12:34.840]  people that just attacked them because they were black most whites are
[12:34.840 --> 12:40.440]  completely castrated cowards self-hating mind control victims but I never even
[12:40.440 --> 12:43.840]  gave into the racism and I transcended it because I also ran into being in
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.960]  small towns other areas or at a bonfire many times when college age men would
[12:49.960 --> 12:55.760]  show up and want to beat up high school students and act tough and and try to
[12:55.760 --> 13:01.680]  knock me upside the heaven postal diggers I mean I've been at parties with
[13:01.680 --> 13:06.080]  kegs of beer by the lake up by Dallas when people got basically you know hurt
[13:06.080 --> 13:11.480]  really bad on both sides so I understood it was tribal at even the age of 14 or
[13:11.480 --> 13:16.480]  15 that it was groups of men would use an excuse to get organized and get
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.040]  angry at somebody else just like groups of men black men Hispanic men white men
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.400]  mixed groups for 60 70 years we'll go to known gay bars and rob them and beat
[13:26.400 --> 13:29.680]  them up now they wouldn't go rob a normal patron coming out of a bar at
[13:29.680 --> 13:34.360]  midnight but they would do it to the homosexual community because well they
[13:34.360 --> 13:37.880]  deserve it you see it's a form of discrimination well if you're a white
[13:37.880 --> 13:43.600]  male now and you're on a university you are told you're inherently bad and
[13:43.600 --> 13:49.840]  there's no way to grovel hard enough for any form of forgiveness to be given to
[13:49.840 --> 13:54.400]  you and I've been talking about that for a long time will you see this in these
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.080]  videos where it's a bunch of angry people screaming their voices out for days
[13:59.080 --> 14:04.320]  it's been going on for two weeks actually just running around crazed
[14:04.320 --> 14:08.560]  because you don't become successful in venting something or writing a book or
[14:08.560 --> 14:14.000]  opening a business or working well with others in a company and having
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.600]  innovative ideas that's all companies are looking for let me tell you I don't
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.840]  care what color you are you get the job done you love liberty I love you but
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.080]  this is a manufacturing facility to put chips on people's shoulders and to
[14:27.080 --> 14:36.800]  totally absolutely jack your brain jack your brain and this is gang mentality
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.760]  this is people that weren't in the gang fights that weren't didn't go through the
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.160]  hazing rituals who were brought up in front of television with their liberal
[14:45.160 --> 14:48.640]  parents teaching them how to be upset how to be victimized how to only be in a
[14:48.640 --> 14:54.960]  group now exploring revolution exploring military science this is the most base
[14:54.960 --> 15:02.120]  level 10,000 BC level science that they're manifesting but it is war it is
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.400]  capture the flag it is you will capitulate to our demands it's terrorism
[15:07.400 --> 15:13.360]  it's a form of political terrorism you notice it's the liberal colleges you
[15:13.360 --> 15:15.960]  know out in California where the cops spray everybody in the you know the
[15:15.960 --> 15:19.960]  school stills defends it because that's those are colleges now run by only women
[15:19.960 --> 15:23.840]  and minorities then it's okay and I've had professors on to talk about the
[15:23.840 --> 15:29.160]  liberal tyranny but we should get that Japanese professor on Hamamoto he's on
[15:29.160 --> 15:34.520]  Thursday perfect I mean he's Asian you know you'd call him classically
[15:34.520 --> 15:37.520]  liberal but because he said man this political crisis is getting a little
[15:37.520 --> 15:40.840]  weird a few years ago they tried to throw him out of the college but he stood
[15:40.840 --> 15:46.080]  up to him and it has become total cult level I keep using that term but you
[15:46.080 --> 15:51.640]  watch these videos I want to go to Missouri but I was sitting there this
[15:51.640 --> 15:57.000]  morning and I thought jacari Jackson's perfect because jacari is a focused
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.320]  calm gentlemanly person one of the most calm honorable smart nice people I've
[16:03.320 --> 16:07.600]  ever met but I've seen him get mad a few times and he doesn't blow up like I do
[16:07.600 --> 16:12.600]  he's authoritative about it and when the abortionists were attacking me in some
[16:12.600 --> 16:15.240]  other events and I want to talk to when he gets there because he ran home to get
[16:15.240 --> 16:18.400]  his stuff when I called him this morning to say you know get ready I'm a city to
[16:18.400 --> 16:23.320]  Missouri and I want him to because he'll go there and try to be friendly and
[16:23.320 --> 16:26.480]  nice they just try to get the story of what's happening but I want him to march
[16:26.480 --> 16:32.680]  into this camp as a man and see what they do to him and I think even though
[16:32.680 --> 16:36.560]  the fact he's black they'll probably go after it because it's it's it's a
[16:36.560 --> 16:40.160]  feminist running it behind the scenes they're the generals in these videos
[16:40.160 --> 16:44.680]  they're behind commanding from the university and what they're doing is
[16:44.680 --> 16:49.040]  moving to get themselves put in charge of it not because they can bring more
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.560]  alumni or more money not because they can get better students or better sports
[16:52.560 --> 16:56.720]  people not because they can get more investment but just because they got
[16:56.720 --> 16:59.800]  chips on their shoulder this is a political takeover and see they already
[16:59.800 --> 17:06.640]  ran the universities but now they've drunk the Kool-Aid of Balkanization so
[17:06.640 --> 17:15.640]  much and so deeply and so entirely that now if they see a white male even though
[17:15.640 --> 17:20.240]  they're a super liberal white male that goes along with all the brainwashing all
[17:20.240 --> 17:25.960]  the baloney they've got to go and this is capture the flag behavior this is
[17:25.960 --> 17:32.800]  primitive warfare where you've got an agrarian society say of 500 people in a
[17:32.800 --> 17:38.480]  little village let's say on the tiger she freights and you get a few clans of
[17:38.480 --> 17:41.920]  families that are all related with each other but finally they you know create
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.200]  some dispute and then demand that some of the bigger houses built by somebody's
[17:47.200 --> 17:51.640]  ancestors and the larger grainering should be given to them and then they
[17:51.640 --> 17:57.800]  just storm it overrun it and grab it and so this is primitive accumulation
[17:57.800 --> 18:04.320]  basically just a beating of the chest we're in control bow to us here's our
[18:04.320 --> 18:09.760]  demands this isn't over yet and so the president resigns the chancellor resigns
[18:09.760 --> 18:14.000]  more more more give us more give us more because they're not being taught how to
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.520]  have a job or run a factory or actually engage in manufacturing or
[18:19.520 --> 18:23.680]  development of technologies they're learning at these colleges predominantly
[18:23.680 --> 18:29.200]  how to be political bosses how to run around and take control of society how
[18:29.200 --> 18:34.840]  to press the First Amendment how to have people arrested and then the school
[18:34.840 --> 18:38.160]  said if you're not even part of the college you come try to show video or
[18:38.160 --> 18:42.320]  something we're gonna arrest you and Yale has come out and said we agree with
[18:42.320 --> 18:45.600]  our students we're gonna have a march with the head of Yale and others has been
[18:45.600 --> 18:53.240]  announced because the head of student affairs said don't be offended by you
[18:53.240 --> 18:56.560]  know costumes people have a First Amendment right if you don't like it
[18:56.560 --> 19:01.520]  look away the schools now saying this is very evil we may have to do something
[19:01.520 --> 19:06.720]  we're gonna have marches though because you're not allowed to wear costumes I
[19:06.720 --> 19:12.600]  mean you talk about living in a cult country under hardcore fascist oppressors
[19:12.600 --> 19:19.560]  this is it their ideology is fascist in their mindset their their deployment
[19:19.560 --> 19:24.200]  financially is communist but only at one level for the general public the elite
[19:24.200 --> 19:33.720]  offshore above-the-law tax exempt so it's on it is seriously on and they mean
[19:33.720 --> 19:41.400]  business and they they are we have don't care what color you are we as men as
[19:41.400 --> 19:47.240]  women as pro-liberty people have been so cowed and so removed that crazy people
[19:47.240 --> 19:51.320]  taking control of any power structure this out there and are now self-destructing
[19:51.320 --> 19:55.840]  in front of us just screaming I'm in control I have the power bow to me I'm
[19:55.840 --> 20:05.000]  God talk like I say earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages
[20:05.000 --> 20:09.040]  or war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be
[20:09.040 --> 20:13.080]  better prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then
[20:13.080 --> 20:17.440]  we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking
[20:17.440 --> 20:21.760]  about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will
[20:21.760 --> 20:25.760]  I keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but
[20:25.760 --> 20:29.560]  the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with
[20:29.560 --> 20:33.760]  you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without
[20:33.760 --> 20:37.800]  smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel
[20:37.800 --> 20:42.920]  the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers

[24:07.600 --> 24:15.080]  gonna play a ton of clips of the designing Chancellor of the Missouri
[24:15.080 --> 24:24.920]  state system college system of the Soros spinoff 1950 group responding to the
[24:24.920 --> 24:32.240]  resignations saying this is only the beginning and more but look at Yale the
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.760]  faculty of Yale the head of Yale is gonna march with the quote minority
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.120]  students and talk about their great pain in the fact that Halloween was not
[24:42.120 --> 24:51.280]  banned by a subdivision of Yale by the two professors that headed up a husband
[24:51.280 --> 24:58.040]  and wife who by the way it turns out were partially elected by Geraldine
[24:58.040 --> 25:04.000]  Luther one of the young women screaming in fear of Halloween and saying that she
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.680]  demands a safe place and let it be banned we now have a chance to meet the
[25:08.680 --> 25:13.640]  privileged Yale student who shrieked at her professor but that's not the issue
[25:13.640 --> 25:22.520]  the big issue is CNN MSNBC all of them New York Times are reporting on this
[25:22.520 --> 25:26.480]  like it's normal and good and encouraging it when they know it's
[25:26.480 --> 25:30.960]  completely sick and twisted because this is what they're going to use to ban free
[25:30.960 --> 25:34.480]  speech in this country they've already done it in areas like Germany and
[25:34.480 --> 25:41.320]  Sweden the police are federally barred in Sweden from reporting on radical
[25:41.320 --> 25:46.320]  Islamic rapes or killings in Germany if you demonstrate against open borders you
[25:46.320 --> 25:52.960]  can be arrested and some are being arrested and find how is that freedom but
[25:52.960 --> 25:58.040]  that's where this is going this is known conscious to totalitarianism by the
[25:58.040 --> 26:02.280]  professors and up that are part of it and when you look at the video the raw
[26:02.280 --> 26:05.520]  video we're going to play coming up it's on info wars com photographer
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.280]  threatened with mob violence for asserting First Amendment rights you
[26:09.280 --> 26:14.960]  see the women the white women every single one of them stomping around with
[26:14.960 --> 26:20.760]  their eyes bugged out in in fighting mode with their shoulders bowed and
[26:20.760 --> 26:25.200]  their fists together saying get me muscle take them out I mean they're like
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.560]  Marine Corps commandos ordering their you know their forces into battle of
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.520]  course you're not though but we're so wimpy that we bow to you oh yes I'll
[26:34.520 --> 26:40.840]  use the words you say master and there's all these white kids Hispanic kids
[26:40.840 --> 26:44.920]  Asian black just running around in fear going media you're evil you're
[26:44.920 --> 26:49.560]  oppressing us get it's like a Monty Python skit but it's not funny because
[26:49.560 --> 26:54.400]  it's real and now the liberal media goes what happened at the colleges
[26:54.400 --> 27:00.400]  they're mentally ill what's happening you did this by design we now have Yale
[27:00.400 --> 27:06.280]  alumni are fundraising with a collar reports to send pro free speech book to
[27:06.280 --> 27:10.640]  administrators faculty and students they're fundraising and explaining that
[27:10.640 --> 27:17.440]  you know even offensive speeches protect in fact it's more protected but you
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.360]  know costume parties have nothing to do with racism so you really need to stop
[27:22.360 --> 27:28.440]  they don't care they want power now all they know how to do is be chip on the
[27:28.440 --> 27:34.000]  shoulder that's their job that's the culture now is to be a divided
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.480]  dysfunctional mentally ill entitled house so let's go to her clip of her
[27:38.480 --> 27:43.320]  shrieking in case you missed it and going shut the f up and everything we
[27:43.320 --> 27:46.600]  bleep that part and then we're going to cut to what happened before with the
[27:46.600 --> 27:50.560]  professor and the great evil he was saying that made her respond that way
[27:50.560 --> 27:56.160]  then we're going to go to the latest in Missouri and it is over the top I mean
[27:56.160 --> 27:59.040]  you want to see what the Talitarianism looks like you want to see what it look
[27:59.040 --> 28:03.480]  like the first year is a Mao in China this is where it all began with the
[28:03.480 --> 28:09.080]  young people being the most radical and being given power by the system to
[28:09.080 --> 28:16.600]  absolutely go hog wild of course here I'm sorry for you guys our forebears were
[28:16.600 --> 28:24.280]  ready for this and we got the jump on you about 200 some years I'm sorry but

[28:28.240 --> 28:32.040]  operation against the patriots of this country all your southern poverty law
[28:32.040 --> 28:36.520]  center propaganda's gonna fall flat on its face as we've totally educated the
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.760]  police and the military so it's pretty much game over for you scum let's go
[28:40.760 --> 28:50.760]  ahead and go to part of this shrieking
[29:11.720 --> 29:14.640]  now let's just shut it off here most people seen and are heard at the full

[33:16.400 --> 33:22.440]  radio network the enemy has made a critical error they've been operating
[33:22.440 --> 33:26.080]  as if they weren't up against any resistance or they've been lying to
[33:26.080 --> 33:30.480]  themselves saying the resistance wasn't strong the truth is with actual media
[33:30.480 --> 33:34.720]  reach the libertarian patriot media combine in the United States is
[33:34.720 --> 33:38.920]  headless that means it's very hard to defeat very hard to discredit or target
[33:38.920 --> 33:46.320]  it's decentralized and it's much bigger in total aggregate news projection and
[33:46.320 --> 33:51.040]  being able to reach people we are winning the info war in the news
[33:51.040 --> 33:55.440]  spectrum as Hillary Clinton had to admit five years ago as secretary of
[33:55.440 --> 34:01.960]  state in a congressional hearing that's the good news the bad news is that's
[34:01.960 --> 34:08.080]  only 25% in my estimation of information warfare in the United States in
[34:08.080 --> 34:18.760]  North America worldwide as well 70 plus percent is embedded in TV shows movies
[34:18.760 --> 34:24.720]  and fiction products and in the fiction products there is overt and
[34:24.720 --> 34:30.320]  subliminal programming we're gonna put a report out by Friday on this a lengthy
[34:30.320 --> 34:35.640]  video report showing and how they're paying for it not just showing you
[34:35.640 --> 34:42.040]  examples but how they admit they're paying for it the CIA domestically to
[34:42.040 --> 34:47.200]  divide and conquer and brain damage this country so yes we are really routing
[34:47.200 --> 34:51.400]  the enemy in the news area the problem is large portions of the public
[34:51.400 --> 34:58.360]  especially college students do not consume news they suck their thumbs they
[34:58.360 --> 35:03.560]  play video games and they watch TV all day they're so similar I don't care of
[35:03.560 --> 35:11.520]  their black or their white or their Hispanic they are literally pathetic in
[35:11.520 --> 35:16.680]  the statistics Asians don't play as many video games or watch as much TV in the
[35:16.680 --> 35:22.100]  US because that's the cream that's been sent here Asians in Japan and South
[35:22.100 --> 35:27.640]  Korea and in China are even more brain damaged literally they actually are
[35:27.640 --> 35:32.280]  brain damaged by television and have had their brains rewired and are drooling
[35:32.280 --> 35:37.240]  victims so it's it's it's it's very very sad but these these anomalies are very
[35:37.240 --> 35:40.760]  very interesting and again when I talk about drooling victims just type in
[35:40.760 --> 35:45.600]  screen time damages brain screen time causes neurological disorders screen time
[35:45.600 --> 35:51.560]  causes lowering of IQ screen time associated with lower productivity and
[35:51.560 --> 36:00.240]  depression and being unfulfilled see I only watch the screen to analyze
[36:00.240 --> 36:04.920]  propaganda in key snippets and still it's revolting and depressing but I have
[36:04.920 --> 36:10.440]  to do it to expose the enemy but even when I watch a movie I don't suspend
[36:10.440 --> 36:14.680]  disbelief anymore I remember the last times I can suspend disbelief as I'm
[36:14.680 --> 36:18.640]  as maybe 18 years old and I could go in and just get into fantasy man and watch
[36:18.640 --> 36:25.000]  a movie does not happen anymore but movies are better now than I'm sitting
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  there coldly analyzing them conscious for two and a half hours they've expanded
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.960]  the average film of two and a half hours they found people have a higher
[36:33.960 --> 36:39.280]  perceived value for what they pay of its two and a half hours longer longer and
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.880]  you can read all the social engineering all the admissions it's all out there by
[36:43.880 --> 36:50.080]  the technocrats and they decided to bring in a totalitarian system worldwide
[36:50.080 --> 36:54.800]  and to attack language itself and to have humans attack each other on age on
[36:54.800 --> 37:03.480]  region on gender on so-called race and betraying true liberals that sought to
[37:03.480 --> 37:07.760]  bring a quality and freedom and what Martin Luther King talked about judging
[37:07.760 --> 37:10.720]  people not by their skin but by the character of their deeds and their
[37:10.720 --> 37:16.880]  conduct now we see again the inverse of that being carried out by the so-called
[37:16.880 --> 37:22.680]  left and the old left for all their problems going this is crazy you can't
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.920]  ban costume parties colleges are supposed to be more about free expression
[37:26.920 --> 37:33.720]  than any other place and they go we're gonna have you fired here are demands
[37:33.720 --> 37:40.520]  admit your racist submit to us well actually I'm a big liberal all right all
[37:40.520 --> 37:48.560]  you're right I'm sorry I resign good now we have more demands do what must be done
[37:48.560 --> 37:55.600]  immediately this is what it is to be conquered and to be captured I'm gonna
[37:55.600 --> 37:58.200]  break it down and play these powerful videos the latest developments in a
[37:58.200 --> 38:04.000]  moment but they have figuratively but literally as well culturally jump the
[38:04.000 --> 38:11.520]  shark because it is so wildly insane and over the top now in their power grab
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.040]  that it will wake people up they've gone too far but we're at a critical point
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.200]  where it doesn't matter if you just get woke up but don't say no to it don't
[38:21.200 --> 38:31.040]  stand up to it then a lot of people will just capitulate to this tyranny but we
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.600]  need to go out to the University of Texas and find these people and get in
[38:33.600 --> 38:36.960]  their faces that want to ban Halloween we need to go out to all the universities
[38:36.960 --> 38:41.200]  of citizen journalists need to and really go what's your problem little baby
[38:41.200 --> 38:44.840]  all you know how to do is claim you've been violated or somebody's been mean to
[38:44.840 --> 38:50.160]  you this is pathetic you're being taught how to have a victim mentality and
[38:50.160 --> 38:55.360]  never be successful you're being sabotaged you're being screwed up don't
[38:55.360 --> 38:59.880]  you understand the science of it it's got to be done we're gonna go to that in

[44:48.640 --> 44:52.120]  MNFM affiliates as well and support their local sponsors continue to spread
[44:52.120 --> 44:58.560]  the word so all over the country at major universities professors that have done
[44:58.560 --> 45:04.080]  nothing deans and presidents have done nothing somebody sees a swastika drawn
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.280]  in poop I hate to be gross but that's what was caused all this and somebody
[45:08.280 --> 45:12.880]  said at a party a drunk guy said something racially insensitive and so
[45:12.880 --> 45:17.560]  because of that because the police didn't arrest the one guy who they
[45:17.560 --> 45:23.680]  reported on you have weeks of hunger striking hyperventilating all this
[45:23.680 --> 45:28.680]  craziness and I thought I'd actually play the video this is from Yale with
[45:28.680 --> 45:35.680]  professor Nicholas Christakis who with his wife heads up this student affairs
[45:35.680 --> 45:41.800]  subsection that that's over a subsection of Yale and here's what he said to her
[45:41.800 --> 45:46.920]  that made her freak out here it is I have said I'm sorry for causing you
[45:46.920 --> 45:51.440]  pain that is different that is different in fact that's different than the
[45:51.440 --> 45:55.160]  statement that I'm sorry for what I said there's a big difference between the
[45:55.160 --> 46:02.520]  two guys do you stand behind I stand behind free speech yes I do
[46:02.520 --> 46:05.640]  especially when it's offensive even when it denigrates me even when it
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.680]  denigrates you even though I don't agree with the content of the speech I have
[46:09.680 --> 46:25.480]  the same objections to the speech that you do the same ones everybody says I
[46:25.480 --> 46:28.600]  am hurt does that mean everyone else has to stop speaking that's not what was
[46:28.600 --> 46:36.680]  happening with the content of your speech I am against racism as you are
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.120]  I am it's against social inequality as you are I have spent my life addressing
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.280]  these issues even some of the students in my class but that is different than
[46:47.280 --> 46:50.720]  the freedom of speech the right to defend people to say what everyone is
[46:50.720 --> 46:54.320]  putting you okay putting your right to write what you want to speak to me which
[46:54.320 --> 46:58.760]  I will also defend the eyes one more thing when I was at other institutions I
[46:58.760 --> 47:03.880]  have defended people with your views against tremendous opposition people
[47:03.880 --> 47:08.120]  with your views that the administration tried to fair it out and expel I will
[47:08.120 --> 47:12.720]  defend you to say whatever you want anywhere you want to understand accept
[47:12.720 --> 47:16.200]  to disrupt a classroom where someone is trying to teach students which is the
[47:16.200 --> 47:20.120]  Yale policy by the way so we're coming up with another one exception is because
[47:20.120 --> 47:27.360]  other people have rights to not just you can't disrupt private places so here's
[47:27.360 --> 47:32.080]  what's happening people want to be social justice warriors they want to get
[47:32.080 --> 47:37.840]  their stripes of combat so now they see brown paper bags they see people white
[47:37.840 --> 47:40.880]  people dancing to rap music and you're making fun of black people I mean these
[47:40.880 --> 47:44.560]  are the type of things that are being done or you say men and women together
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.600]  and feminists say that's hurtful all male with female sex is patriarchy you've
[47:50.600 --> 47:53.560]  got all these liberals that bought into this that don't realize this is weaponized
[47:53.560 --> 47:57.160]  now let's start going to this and we'll come back from break and play the rest
[47:57.160 --> 48:02.760]  because the real powerful stuff's at the end where they march over everybody it's
[48:02.760 --> 48:09.000]  not only now that people start backing off the students with the newspaper who
[48:09.000 --> 48:13.840]  by the way you know it's like a Chinese guy they then run over them kind of like
[48:13.840 --> 48:18.520]  the abortionist did when I was outside protesting at the Planned Parenthood
[48:18.520 --> 48:21.800]  facility a few months ago with Jacari and others they would just link arms and
[48:21.800 --> 48:26.040]  run into us and ram old people over and stuff and then say stop assaulting me
[48:26.040 --> 48:30.600]  this is what they do howling and screaming I'll just skip this break I
[48:30.600 --> 48:34.200]  can't help it that way we can get to all this it's a network break so station
[48:34.200 --> 48:38.280]  shouldn't play anything over it no other talk ready I'll touch this but I do it
[48:38.280 --> 48:45.240]  folks I just can't all myself and so we're seeing this happen and then they
[48:45.240 --> 48:51.880]  run over people and what's crazy is you see white women white men black men who
[48:51.880 --> 48:55.640]  are like they're on the basketball team big guys just grinding their teeth with
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.000]  hatred looking at this Chinese guy and the guys like man I just got a job to do
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.480]  I'm taking photos I'm not doing anything and they can and finally they go you lose
[49:03.480 --> 49:07.600]  you lose because they're grabbing his camera he backs off and then they just
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.080]  run everybody over and then somebody goes behind them and then the feminist
[49:12.080 --> 49:17.120]  professor commanding the operation she runs over and goes get me muscle get him
[49:17.120 --> 49:21.600]  out of here and they've taken over the commons green area and they don't let
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.400]  other students in this is just want to be gangs I'll be wearing leather jackets
[49:26.400 --> 49:31.160]  like the fawns and you know from grease or something what's that great movie
[49:31.160 --> 49:34.440]  about gangs fighting each other white gangs it's one of the guys name is
[49:34.440 --> 49:38.640]  pony the Warriors is good too but what's one of the worries called pony boy or
[49:38.640 --> 49:43.080]  whatever and they've got people killing each other and stuff I'm gonna think of
[49:43.080 --> 49:46.520]  that movie it's a good one too but I mean that's what this is you pull up at
[49:46.520 --> 49:50.560]  Sonic you're 16 years old you're dating somebody's ex-girlfriend there's three
[49:50.560 --> 49:55.120]  guys in a truck they get out they come over and beat you up I mean that's just
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.800]  what this is it's gang mentality it's horde mentality all humans do it it's
[49:59.800 --> 50:03.280]  primitive and they've done people down so much now that they're just like our
[50:03.280 --> 50:07.160]  university all whites out unless you're a woman what was the name of the movie
[50:07.160 --> 50:12.120]  you said the outsiders the outsiders yeah I mean that's all this is if you got a
[50:12.120 --> 50:15.280]  town of just white people there'll be four gangs of whites that kill each other
[50:15.280 --> 50:19.160]  you got a town of just black people they'll all kill each other too it's like
[50:19.160 --> 50:22.400]  the Star Trek episode where one side of the face is black the others white and
[50:22.400 --> 50:26.040]  then the opposite group is the is the slave group they have the same IQ but
[50:26.040 --> 50:30.080]  just have different color faces and then one group and slaves the other that's
[50:30.080 --> 50:35.360]  all this is I mean who thought that quote minorities run by George Soros and
[50:35.360 --> 50:39.520]  the Justice Department wouldn't act like every other culture every culture did
[50:39.520 --> 50:44.480]  stuff like this this is what humans do when they degenerate so for radio
[50:44.480 --> 50:48.240]  listeners I will kind of give you play-by-play over the audio and narrate
[50:48.240 --> 50:54.160]  this here is the video it's six minutes long photographer threatened with mob
[50:54.160 --> 50:59.600]  violence for asserting First Amendment rights it's up on info wars.com and it
[50:59.600 --> 51:05.520]  ends with the commander the general Melissa Klick assistant professor of
[51:05.520 --> 51:11.080]  mass media trying to annihilate the right of the press and grabbing people's
[51:11.080 --> 51:15.080]  cameras before demanding he leave and then saying who wants to help me get
[51:15.080 --> 51:19.640]  this reporter out of here I need some muscle over here hey you should have
[51:19.640 --> 51:24.640]  joined the military lady if you want to be in black ops you want to you want to
[51:24.640 --> 51:28.800]  overrun people you want to overrun machine gun nests you want to sneak into
[51:28.800 --> 51:33.400]  bases you want to I mean this is all just a bunch of weak nobody's just strutting
[51:33.400 --> 51:40.840]  around going we're in control now it's pathetic this is entitlement and I'm
[51:40.840 --> 51:43.720]  telling you folks it's happened to me at least three times I haven't run a lot of
[51:43.720 --> 51:47.080]  racial stuff in Austin until the last few years because of all the hyping of
[51:47.080 --> 51:53.840]  this but I've been at UT eating outside UT at a cafe and two black guys walk by
[51:53.840 --> 51:57.640]  and they go look at the blue devil gonna do something devil it's like come on
[51:57.640 --> 52:01.280]  guys you're just looking for trouble you know I care about you and then they go

[52:13.480 --> 52:16.600]  white and demand money from me because obviously it's a form of reparations I
[52:16.600 --> 52:21.360]  owe it and there's racial attacks popping up all over the country at record
[52:21.360 --> 52:26.200]  levels this is sick and the media won't report on it and there's going to be a
[52:26.200 --> 52:30.120]  backlash from self-hating whites I can't tell you how many self-hating whites
[52:30.120 --> 52:35.560]  have a religion of hating themselves and worshiping minorities who now are
[52:35.560 --> 52:39.280]  flipping to the other side and recruiting for white supremacists and
[52:39.280 --> 52:42.320]  others is off the chart which is part of the divide and conquer a gayling and
[52:42.320 --> 52:45.600]  dialectic just like they control prisons everybody's racially divided there

[1:04:55.480 --> 1:05:01.600]  author joining us the Italian government attempted to cover up the arrest of a
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:05.600]  convicted al-Qaeda terrorist who tried to enter the country on a migrant boat
[1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:10.600]  last month German media reports according to NTV the arrest of the
[1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:15.400]  Tunisian-born suspect who was sentenced to seven years in 2007 for plotting
[1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:20.000]  multiple terror attacks was initially hidden by authorities over fears that it
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:24.680]  would stoke panic the suspect who was arrested at sea while traveling with
[1:05:24.680 --> 1:05:29.720]  more than 200 migrants told police he was seeking asylum in Europe in order to
[1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:34.680]  escape persecution after providing a false name following several days of
[1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:39.800]  interrogation by police the suspect was deported back to Tunisia and handed over
[1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:44.320]  to local authorities as noted by the independent the alleged attempt to cover
[1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:48.720]  up the arrest was likely rooted in the Italian interior ministers claim that
[1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:52.480]  there was no evidence that Islamic terrorists were sneaking into Europe

[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:54.760]  if you're a TV viewer I was showing Ted Anderson and Michael's whirling he owns
[1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:58.600]  a few of the stations were on around the new studios during that three minute
[1:08:58.600 --> 1:09:02.360]  break and usually I've got a little clock in my head but I started talking
[1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:07.120]  about radio with them and suddenly they were yelling get in here so I ran in
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:13.120]  here and we're now on air where to begin we do have our guests don't we
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:17.000]  fantastic we're gonna go to him here in just a moment on my favorite talk show
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.360]  hosting a good friend of mine this is a parallel that Richard in their run the
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:24.360]  board came up with this morning and it's funny because I thought of this exact
[1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:30.800]  scene parallel this morning the Salem witch trials versus the social justice
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:36.520]  trials in the Salem witch trials in Massachusetts the episode is one of the
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:43.520]  nation's most notorious cases of mass hysteria and has been used in political
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:48.560]  rhetoric and popular literature as a vivid cautionary tale about the dangers
[1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:54.040]  of isolationist behavior religious extremism false accusations and lapses
[1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:59.480]  in due process it was not unique but simply an American example of a much
[1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:03.440]  broader phenomenon of which trials in the early modern period many historians
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:06.960]  consider the lasting effects of the trials to have been highly influential
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:12.920]  and subsequent United States history well the truth is the sadist in people in
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:17.920]  the dark ages and on like to actually engage in satanic activity so the Satanist
[1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:22.680]  would run the witch trials that's the next level there was Satanism going on
[1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:26.600]  it was rampant in Europe with the witch trials it's clear that really wasn't
[1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:30.360]  going on but if you actually look at the Inquisition and a lot of other
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:36.600]  operations you would learn that sadist bare minimum were the ones actually doing
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:41.840]  what they were claiming other people were up to but it was not unique but
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:44.960]  simply an American example the much broader phenomenon of which trials in
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:48.200]  early modern period many historians consider the lasting effects of the
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:51.360]  trials to have been highly influential and subsequently United States history
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:58.040]  now he just changed it over with social justice trials the crime of being white
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:05.640]  by wolf the president now the other chancellor has resigned the social
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:10.040]  justice trials the episode is one of the nation's most notorious cases of mass
[1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:13.640]  hysteria and will be used in political rhetoric and popular literature as a
[1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:17.640]  vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of socialism politically correct
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:22.360]  extremism false accusations and lapses in due process it is not unique but
[1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:27.000]  simply an American example of much broader phenomenon of which trials in
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.840]  the common era many historians will consider the lasting effects of the
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:35.760]  trials to be highly influential and subsequent United States history we
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:38.280]  should put this out as an article actually with some of these videos
[1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:43.600]  because if you just joined us the last hour I played in fact let's play the
[1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:45.920]  last minute before we go to man cows I want him to hear this and see this he's
[1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:52.040]  probably already seen it there's not much out there usually that we don't you
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:55.760]  know already basically aren't informed of lots of he brings up I'm already aware
[1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:59.800]  of a lot of stuff that he brings up or that I bring up he's also aware of but
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:06.400]  it's important if you just joined us to understand that you've got a Chinese
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:11.080]  camera guy you've got a school reporter person college newspaper reporter
[1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:15.080]  person who's white who's behind the camera and other people being told their
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:17.960]  racist they're hateful they're bad because they're in a school commons
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:24.000]  area on the front lawn of Missouri State's head campus and they're just
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  screaming and yelling at them and then run them over and then turn and you see
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.160]  one of the feminist professors in the back commanding everyone Melissa
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:39.400]  click professor of mass media this is who runs the free speech operations
[1:12:39.400 --> 1:12:46.000]  there saying get me muscle get them out of here take them out we are so close
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.680]  to totalitarianism in this country and I want to ask me and Cal why he thinks
[1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:54.680]  they're getting so brazen so foaming at the mouth bizarre because we know it's
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:58.440]  being directed I mean Soros and others are on record directing it but are they
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:02.720]  really this crazy because even Atlantic Monthly a very liberal publication did a
[1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:07.000]  28-page article I talked about last two weeks almost every day saying their
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:12.240]  children their kids they've sent as liberals hardcore liberals to colleges
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:16.400]  come back and denounce them and get in their faces these are just a bunch of
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.680]  spoiled rotten brats who've been told they're God and they're they're very
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:25.000]  socially awkward they can't communicate they're scared that's all admitted so
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.800]  they get real aggressive and just scream at literature at poetry they're
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:34.080]  really just horrible creatures there's another article the new intolerance of
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:41.680]  student activism and that's another article out of the Atlantic so we'll
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:44.760]  get Mancow's take on this and much more he's got a bunch of points he wants to
[1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:49.840]  go over TV host radio host bestselling author a lot of folks obviously know
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:53.820]  who Mancow is frequent gas and been on probably six months but here is this
[1:13:53.820 --> 1:14:00.200]  clip at the end of it let's go ahead and go to this clip of the hysteria that
[1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:07.480]  is causing the president and the chancellor at Missouri State to resign
[57:48.200 --> 1:14:58.120]  campus police let them run people over because they are the
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:02.680]  entitled dog group of all races and colors they have chips on their
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:08.120]  shoulders now one guy gets behind the line here comes the professor I made it

[1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:20.200]  there one nephew just graduated it's it's frightening isn't it I mean you talk
[1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:24.840]  about literature I wish they would have them read the Crucible by Arthur Miller
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:29.840]  every day in Chicago in Evanston I drive past a big sign it says a white car
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:35.400]  excuse me black lives matter and had on the head of the ACLU today and I said
[1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:39.880]  what about white lives what about can we sue can we a business putting that up
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:46.000]  black a lot what about white lives what about lives but are you there sir I'm
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:50.320]  listening I have I owe you a major apology I have that I have I want to
[1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:54.760]  talk about that at some point but listen my friends older than me and Berkeley
[1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:57.880]  were protesting I know you've heard stories like this and people started
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:01.360]  throwing rocks and I heard this at Kent State and I think it's going on at Mizzou
[1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:07.920]  as well and I just before we pick sides here my best friend on earth held down
[1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:11.640]  this guy in Berkeley again he's an old guy an old hippie but I like the guy and
[1:17:11.640 --> 1:17:18.080]  the guy had government ID he was CIA and he was starting the violence I think
[1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:21.400]  there are people that generally want us you know all to get along and love each
[1:17:21.400 --> 1:17:27.320]  other I think we have more in common than we than we know and you ask who would
[1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:34.000]  do this are we going insane have they gotten more in bolden yeah yes but it's
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  by design this is not accidental this is by design and it's divide and conquer the
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:43.720]  number one thing that these protesters wanted was for the head of the
[1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:47.280]  university again I I grew up in that area brother I spent a lot of time around
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:51.200]  Mizzou and my nephews just graduated right in fact I helped them financially
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:55.920]  and the number one thing that this step you know the 7% of the campus there is
[1:17:55.920 --> 1:18:00.560]  black African-American the number one thing they wanted was for the head of
[1:18:00.560 --> 1:18:05.440]  the campus imagine this to admit that he got to be the head of the university
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:12.040]  because of white privilege they wanted him to say he didn't deserve anything he
[1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:16.560]  did in his life and to say he was a fraud I mean that's beyond like you know
[1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:20.400]  telling Braveheart to say he's a bad guy will tear your guts out it's just the
[1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:26.080]  arrogance of that yeah so Alex where this is headed and look the rich get
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:29.080]  richer and the people that are doing that you know the communist fest and
[1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:33.280]  raising all the hell in the zoo you know the spewing nonsense these morons no
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:38.000]  matter what are gonna stay stupid people you know but but what happens is they
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:41.320]  they do you know the white guy oh that black I took my job the black guy white
[1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:46.120]  he gets everything there's plenty of room at the big table everybody can be
[1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:48.960]  sitting at the table with us Alex drinking sweet wine and enjoying life
[1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:53.200]  but what they want to do is they create you know this Muslim that guy this guy
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:58.520]  did that they keep us fighting and then they collect the spoils okay they
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:01.680]  collect it so so look you already know this I'm you're the choir and I'm the
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:05.280]  preacher but let me let me just make my final point here and this is that this
[1:19:05.280 --> 1:19:09.960]  is you live in a nice house you don't deserve that white man you got that
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:14.960]  because you didn't build the roads you didn't build the bridges you know white
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:19.080]  privilege admit it you have that you have that nice house and that nice farm
[1:19:19.080 --> 1:19:22.800]  and that nice piece of land and we need to break all this up and where's my 40
[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:29.120]  acres and it's massive redistribution of wealth global warming oh you can't have
[1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:33.960]  you can't do that we need to break this up a new tax it's all about stealing
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:38.100]  from us Obama told Africans he said you can't have a house a car air
[1:19:38.100 --> 1:19:43.200]  conditioning this is austerity for everybody so so this is what it really
[1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:47.000]  is you know admit white privilege imagine they wanted the head of the
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:52.680]  campus this this poor idiot and he is an idiot but he's a flaming liberal that's
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:57.000]  yeah that's right oh you know but they eat their own don't they they're like
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:20:00.440]  hamsters I had hamsters I watched them eat their own that's that's the lefty
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:09.000]  mindset and I I I just cannot believe how how vile with with the fist in the
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:12.560]  air the communist fist in the air and making demands of you're you're in
[1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:17.560]  positions of man nothing you're a student I and look I've never been the
[1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:22.440]  meathead football guy I don't meet colleges about education but you know I
[1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:25.320]  would have I mean what what we should have said what Missouri should have said
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:31.400]  show me what they should have said is okay no football then and and you're
[1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:37.360]  going to college for free and you're done get out of here look brother I went
[1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:41.400]  to Central Missouri State University it's now called it's now called UCM and
[1:20:41.400 --> 1:20:45.040]  every year I I pay for someone to go to college I took a great deal of heat
[1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:52.240]  because it's not based on race it's based on well it's based on talent who
[1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:56.400]  cares about skin color you and I don't care about skin color so so at this
[1:20:56.400 --> 1:20:59.720]  university that I went to I saw all the football players come in and they took
[1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:04.480]  the SATs in about two minutes for me it was a you know a full weekend
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:09.080]  commitment but they were in I saw them take you know flunk every test and the
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:12.520]  football players were pushed through and this happens at every university and
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:17.120]  these morons are usually violent look at what we're seeing in the NFL so so they
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:23.320]  let these violent morons of Mizzou destroy this man and I just it's it is
[1:21:23.320 --> 1:21:29.240]  something isn't it these are strange days now we should play the Morrison song
[1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:34.200]  the door strange days have found us they're going to destroy us I mean all
[1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:38.640]  this is going to do from what I've read this is like the first openly gay
[1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:45.920]  football players super liberal why is it that the mentally ill left love to eat
[1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:50.480]  their own and then just shout each other down trying to show off who's a better
[1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:59.600]  PC police look you can't Alex let me tell you something okay my wife and I
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:04.320]  were arguing and I said to her I said honey you're overreacting and you know
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:08.680]  you know she said to me Alex hmm she goes after using logic and thinking this
[1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:13.960]  all out and looking at the facts honey you're right I overreacted I'm just
[1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:21.560]  kidding Alex that would never happen any married man look there's no facts it's
[1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:25.760]  all emotion it's like you and I when we fight it's a motion it turns into a
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:31.680]  motion and they have learned it's all in skin others it's a motion look at that
[1:22:31.680 --> 1:22:36.640]  poor oppressed person well that's my next question to you don't the chumps
[1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:44.040]  know that the Soros Ford Foundation white feminist are simply trying to bully
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:49.120]  and terrorize the school to put them in charge and that this is just a literal
[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:53.200]  mutiny against people that have gotten their jobs because they can get more
[1:22:53.200 --> 1:22:57.720]  money into the school and know how to hop knob nothing to do with what color
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:00.840]  they are nowadays folks believe me these universities who care less they'll put
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:04.440]  people in charge no matter what color they are if they think they can make
[1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:08.880]  this a little more successful but imagine if they put these twisted bizarre
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:14.840]  totalitarian feminist in charge this is literally animal farm where you've got
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:20.160]  the pigs these female professors running all these minions under them who are
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:26.360]  just becoming their slaves gay straight Christian black what whatever look
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:30.160]  they're always going to manipulate the and look I'm a believer in a higher
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:34.360]  power so I mean I'm a Christian I want to say that but the stupidest of every
[1:23:34.360 --> 1:23:39.360]  group the most reactionary are always going to be used these feet you know
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:43.520]  those look you saw those people they're morons at Mizzou and they're being
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:47.840]  manipulated and and and don't they realize what's going to happen Alex they
[1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:53.120]  don't care and when you say they you're saying we when people say they how could
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:23:57.120]  they do that what you're really saying is I couldn't do that you're giving them
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:01.360]  empathy well I don't care if they were black I don't care if they're white the
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:05.880]  entire crowd of these idiots in the videos look completely moronic they all
[1:24:05.880 --> 1:24:10.000]  whether it's a white woman or a black guy or a white guy they literally look
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:16.960]  like who you would get to put in the dictionary by the word moral stupid they
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:22.800]  look stupid hey and here's here's the best part not only are they stupid but
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:26.320]  I'm sure many of them were paying for their school because you know they're
[1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:30.640]  stupid we can't expect them to pay for their own school and and they're angry
[1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:36.960]  and violent whoa boy brother you know you understand I live in Beirut I live in
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:41.400]  the city of Chicago my friend that you do the yet I have to step over dead
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:46.400]  bodies to get into work and and you can't give enough and they just had a
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:51.640]  they had just had a standing ovation for the biggest tax increase look look
[1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:55.960]  Alex Alex have you ever known a rich kid they're miserable you give them more
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:24:58.640]  money they're miserable dad buys more for them they're visible let's talk
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:03.760]  about rich kids that are given everything when you give a man everything he
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:11.960]  wants more and he hates you and I want more more I want more ever you're never
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:16.800]  gonna give the angry enough you totally agree so what do you think the end game
[1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:21.920]  is by the George Soros social engineers you and I constantly criticize corrupt
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:26.040]  police departments bad cops we also support good cops and we see how the
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:30.200]  globalists are trying to create social unrest and have a revolution against
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:35.640]  local government for federalization but how does George Soros and Obama think
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:39.440]  they're gonna get away with openly funding cop killer groups and then the
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:44.520]  question is well maybe they are because I don't see the police groups going
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:47.920]  after the White House or going after the Justice Department I see him going
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:52.640]  after Tarantino but but I mean what he's done nothing compared to what George
[1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:58.640]  Soros and the Ford Foundation has done Hillary was standing here where I'm at
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:02.440]  right now was here a few days ago saying everybody in Chicago's got to give up

[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:38.760]  on air 21 years ago I was a mainline libertarian and people were bringing me
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:42.720]  this stuff I didn't believe a lot of it either and then it just it's so crazy so
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:49.960]  don't apologize I mean you've taught me a lot of stuff too man well Alex I it
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:54.720]  hasn't been it hasn't aired yet but I went on the streets for a history channel
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:59.600]  special that I'm doing on fluoride and I went on the streets of Chicago and well
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:02.840]  if the government puts our water it must be good you understand that it
[1:29:02.840 --> 1:29:06.440]  dumps down your kids you understand that it's poison well if the government
[1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:11.960]  does it it's okay so look you and I we are the canaries in the coal mine aren't
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:18.000]  we we are and what happens what happens to the canaries Alex they die I well
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:23.160]  they fly or they die so the fact that you're still there doing it is is very
[1:29:23.160 --> 1:29:27.600]  we are a very brave individual well you are too brother I want to come back and
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:33.600]  cover the waterfront what's the big end game what do you see happening next how
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:36.960]  do we stop this but I was just thinking about it I've got national studies on a
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:42.160]  Harvard you name it where black people are twice as acceptable to fluoride but
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:45.160]  you don't hear black lives matter talking about that the number one thing
[1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:52.040]  attacking blacks is fluoride we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex
[1:29:52.040 --> 1:30:01.720]  Jones and the GCN radio network a proposed EU law puts the simple act of
[1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:06.520]  linking to content under copyright protection Julia Reda a German activist
[1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:10.920]  puts it this way the European Commission is preparing a frontal attack on the
[1:30:10.920 --> 1:30:15.720]  hyperlink the basic building block of the internet as we know it this is based
[1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:21.520]  on an absurd idea that just won't die making search engines and news portals
[1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:26.520]  pay media companies for promoting their freely accessible articles Redis sites
[1:30:26.520 --> 1:30:31.160]  a drought communication on copyright reform leaked last week the ideas
[1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:35.400]  expressed by the document challenged the existing interpretation and spirit of a
[1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:40.160]  law as well as common sense each web link would become illegal landmine and
[1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:44.400]  would allow press publishers to hold every single actor on the internet
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:49.000]  liable she went on to explain Reda believes the EU will try to slide this

[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:29.160]  of African descent it's bad for everybody because I want to earn brownie points
[1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:33.560]  or something you know with the politically correct I care about

[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:45.640]  empathy I have empathy with a dying bird on the ground you know it's got
[1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:49.480]  fire ants on it all come and step on its head you know back in college your
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:52.200]  girlfriend said how dare you I thought you were a nice man you stepped on that
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:55.560]  bird's head and I said I told you I'm getting out of its misery it's it's
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:59.480]  already gonna die and she just couldn't understand she was emotional I had a
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:04.400]  girlfriend actually quasi break up with me I said look you're too stupid I just
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:08.720]  I just said you know it's like shooting a horse when it breaks its leg because you
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:16.960]  can't fix it I'm not gonna explain it to you fine lady and it feels the same way
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:20.640]  trying to talk to young people because either young people are either super
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:24.680]  awake or they are super dumb look at this this just came out White House
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:29.040]  praises protesters after forcing University of Missouri president to step
[1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:35.120]  down what a dangerous precedent folks this is what the establishment wants
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:43.480]  they want to be able to bully anybody they want with fake allegations that's
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:48.840]  what they want to do Michael more defense Quentin Tarantino the white guy
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:53.960]  stuck his neck out there and they're trying to chop it off Michael more also
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:58.840]  says I've seen one MSNBC say if you own a gun and you're white you're racist and
[1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:02.120]  that white people are out in the woods hiding from black people because they're
[1:35:02.120 --> 1:35:05.160]  racist really I know a lot of black folks try to move out in the country and get
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:10.640]  away from crime they're race pimps folks the guy has six armed bodyguards
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:19.040]  man Cal Muller a man cal.com is our guest but when we talk about what's going on I
[1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:24.680]  want to amend what I said after birth if you live one of the most deadly things
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:30.120]  facing black people in this country's fluoride and I've tried with the
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:32.600]  politically correct groups when they've been yelling at me for to bring this up
[1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:38.360]  these laugh and go I love it good because they love the government liberals
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:43.520]  do but here's the new American they break down all the different memorandums
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:49.440]  government documents and four year documents from the Center for Disease
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:58.400]  Control where they internally admitted that black suffer most from fluoride it's
[1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:06.640]  an endocrine disruptor I mean it is an adjuvant it is so bad it's got all the
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:11.920]  peer reviewed studies it's got one two three four five six seven eight nine
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:16.600]  nine different studies most of them US government but internal folks had just
[1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:21.080]  last week members of Congress went to the floor and said there are thousands of
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:24.720]  pages of secret documents we can't release from CDC whistleblowers where
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:28.440]  they cover up the autism linked to vaccines and it's the pesticides the
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:32.840]  clavisades it's a cocktail but boys have a weak bloodbrain barrier compared to
[1:36:32.840 --> 1:36:39.360]  girls and it's why 70 plus percent of autistic children or boys they know it's
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:44.480]  being held back but oh there's no social justice warriors for that they're taught
[1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:50.800]  in their classes that that's a conspiracy so brown paper bags they have
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:55.640]  get upset about not other things and I obsess on this now because it's really
[1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:59.240]  coming to fruition I've got a bunch of the subjects I want to cover with man
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:05.280]  cow man cow there's so much to talk about you got cut off at the break talking
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:08.240]  about one of your new TV show pilots you've shot you've done so many different
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:14.520]  hit TV shows what about jeb bush I want to talk about going with your gut our
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:19.240]  cops really our friends we're gonna get a whole bunch of different issues here
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:23.000]  the divorce racket all of it with man cow Muller let's start rolling through
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:28.040]  it but fluoride's one of the big ones man cow I mean as I mentioned 25 studies
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:32.640]  that Harvard did came out two years ago massive IQ reduction cancer infertility
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:35.360]  well we already knew that the White House science I wrote a book about it you
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:39.600]  you you know you see these kids with the scaly teeth we've all seen the kids with
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:45.200]  the scaly teeth yeah that is fluoride the scaly teeth is fluoride it's a
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:50.680]  poison it's a pesticide the government has because the IQ levels are dropping
[1:37:50.680 --> 1:37:55.240]  in our public schools they have reacted you know they have lowered the amount
[1:37:55.240 --> 1:37:58.400]  now right and if it was so good it's so good for you why if they put more in
[1:37:58.400 --> 1:38:02.680]  there yeah they cut it like user they cut it half as our IQs are dropping so
[1:38:02.680 --> 1:38:09.280]  they're right there they've admitted that it's poison that's ultramassive and
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:12.240]  you know you talk about the concern about the paper bags I want to tell you
[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:17.040]  what's happening here to the whole food shoppers my wife she loves whole
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:21.200]  paychecks she just be I we just can't I just can't give enough to that company
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:26.960]  they're just so fantastic and but it's organic anyway you know people are
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:29.880]  getting really sick with these these reusable bags have you heard about this
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:35.440]  yes but tell folks no no I mean you you put all this stuff in your bag and then
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:38.560]  you use the bag over and over the problem is chicken blood and other things
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:42.400]  dripping the bag so people that never had salmonella and other sicknesses are
[1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:47.560]  not sick but right the fact is the paper bag was nothing it's no big deal but
[1:38:47.560 --> 1:38:54.200]  they admit indoor water a sewage and they admit paper bags are the reason
[1:38:54.200 --> 1:38:59.400]  that communicable diseases plunge in the West by 1920 it's a fact that's right
[1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:07.240]  problem reaction solution look I want to talk about Jeb Bush quickly I don't
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:12.040]  believe are you ready for this yes look I have I you know you talked about the
[1:39:12.040 --> 1:39:15.960]  different networks I've worked for I've been in these TV newsrooms I worked for
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:20.920]  Fox in Chicago for the last two years I I don't believe it's a sinister and if
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:23.960]  it is it's in a level that I never saw that the hell hell I guess it could be
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:29.760]  but but I've been also behind the scenes of CBS and other other newscast look
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:34.880]  what Donald Trump said was correct they do pick the winner and the loser again I
[1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:41.800]  don't know that it's sinister Alex but I was there all the big names and they
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:47.280]  pretty much had picked the fight and the fight was Hillary versus Jeb Bush well
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:51.760]  Hillary's near death he's very sick he's really stupid he's really running an
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:57.040]  awful campaign so the left didn't expect that and on the right Jeb Bush was
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:59.920]  going to have all the money and I want to tell you what's happening with the
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:04.600]  money plus I haven't met the person that likes Jeb Bush I mean this is totally a
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:09.240]  totally and believe me I have the pulse on these things I'm a populous like you
[1:40:09.240 --> 1:40:12.720]  are it was a very arrogant move by the establishment to try to sell the corp
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:19.800]  celery and the little spoiled rotten brat Jeb Bush on the American people so
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:23.200]  I'm actually very proud of the American people that they went now
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:27.240]  Bernie Sanders now look the guy's a commie he's a communist but whatever they
[1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:31.320]  rejected what was selected for them and then on the right people were picking
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:36.520]  Trump and and I you know that the establishments freaked out because we're
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:40.360]  not following the script listen that's Syrian bombing and I today is the
[1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:44.640]  anniversary of the Marines you and I are big supporters of the military they
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:48.960]  have to do a lot of things that they don't like but the deal is that that
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:53.880]  hospital those poor kids that were killed that hospital that was bombed and look
[1:40:53.880 --> 1:40:59.520]  Putin hates Jeb Bush he doesn't want another Bush in he hates the Bush family
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:04.880]  and this guy has inserted himself into the Middle East and what what that was
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:09.880]  with the storage this is this comes from a top marine a great source that said
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:14.040]  you know they're cutting off the Bush's money supply around the world you may
[1:41:14.040 --> 1:41:18.680]  remember that hospital it was bombed in Syria what it really was was a storage
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:22.800]  place of methamphetamines billions of dollars worth that were going to be
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:27.080]  circulated throughout the world for the Bush family this is what I've been told
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:34.880]  and Putin they are they are slowly cutting off all of the sources of of income
[1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:40.680]  whether it's oil or drugs or anything I've seen off record even CIA people
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:45.240]  turning against the establishment and the Bush's there is a underground
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:49.360]  revolution at the Pentagon against Hillary and against the Bush's is that
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:56.280]  what you're getting at listen I'm telling you that Jeb Bush eating a pork
[1:41:56.280 --> 1:42:01.640]  chop on a stick with his foot up on a hay bale with his shirt open you wouldn't
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:05.720]  let him there in Austin Texas you he wouldn't even he wouldn't even be
[1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:09.800]  principal he would he'd be he wouldn't he'd be an assistant principal you know
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:15.120]  this don't he don't just a regular guy Jeb Bush give me a break they just quit
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.440]  thinking they're God and that we have kings in this country and these two
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:22.600]  families rule over us so so you agree with me though you've seen the tea
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:27.040]  leaves the the real establishment not not the rulers and the owners but the
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:31.080]  people that actually run things the bureaucracy is sick of what's going on
[1:42:31.080 --> 1:42:34.080]  and sees the country going down the tubes and are you saying there's a major
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:39.240]  sea change even against Hillary and Jeb I'm saying there's a major hatred from
[1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:43.360]  Putin and the rest of the world against the Bush dynasty of course their name is
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:47.560]  not even Bush and they are cutting off their funds this guy you know the daddy
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:52.040]  ran the CIA I love how daddy is now turning on the rum spelled and Chady yes
[1:42:52.040 --> 1:42:56.520]  quite beautiful Bush who has to live George W has to live for a little while
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:01.800]  longer in this country oh no they're great don't say anything daddy daddy's
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:05.080]  on his way out it's kind of like Eisenhower on his way out started
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:09.400]  speaking the truth and that's what's going on with old man Bush and I say
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:13.680]  Jeb's days are numbered because his money is being cut off this guy's a loser and
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:17.320]  people are pulling their funds but a lot of their money is whatever the hell
[1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:21.360]  their real name is Alex what's their real name well it's a German name the
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:25.880]  point is is that they are agents were agents of the Third Reich I mean they
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:30.440]  were the head head had Nazi banker that's what the Bushes are so powerful is
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:34.520]  they got a lot of the money that was put in Latin America by the Nazis and help
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:38.720]  right part of the rat line this is like BBC Discovery Channel stuff I mean we
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:43.120]  first broke it a long time ago but it's now mainstream news that they literally
[1:43:43.120 --> 1:43:47.840]  were the head Nazis in this country did you love Queen Elizabeth Alex we didn't
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:52.480]  talk I want to bring Elizabeth Hitler yeah you should always tell that how the
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:59.080]  hell old by the way how old is she like 80 something 86 I think I just seems
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:03.120]  like she's I don't she just seems much older than what they're than what they're
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:06.800]  letting on yeah let's look up old she is we'll see what I'm right it's 87 88 I know
[1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:11.720]  her husband's like 90 something well listen of course she's there with her
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:15.760]  uncle who was the king of England Highland Hitler and and you know that's
[1:44:15.760 --> 1:44:19.400]  what they do and my old point is I'm not saying it's even a Nazi conspiracy I'm
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:22.480]  not bashing Germans either I mean you got a German last name I'm part German my
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:26.960]  mom's side it's just that the globalist used all the German loot at the end of
[1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:30.480]  World War two to basically fund the Bilderberg group and stuff it's just
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:34.240]  like a James Bond movie she's 89 years old she's 89 years old so she's gotten
[1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:41.680]  one year older I think look my opinion I just think she's much older I think
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:48.720]  there's more to her than what we know well I know her dad got power because
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:53.760]  his brother had to step down Edward the 8th and Edward the 8th was to be put on
[1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:57.920]  the throne of Europe by the Nazis and he was German he had to flee Germany at the
[1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:03.160]  beginning of World War two and he stayed in Spain yeah I mean he couldn't even
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:07.000]  go back to England and then I tell the other yuppie that they go how I was in
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.160]  England with them how dare you say there's a Nazi connection they're not
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:14.840]  even British I'm sorry go ahead Alex yes no I have some I have something I want
[1:45:14.840 --> 1:45:19.520]  to say about that but isn't it funny all the all the crazy islamo kooky stuff
[1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:23.080]  that's going on there all the violence and and the English government's
[1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:27.320]  concerned about Alex Jones I always found that fascinating but but I want to
[1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:31.840]  tell you what I really think is going on okay you ready for this I am okay I sat
[1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:36.600]  next to David Bowie on a plane I like the music of David Bowie David Bowie's
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:42.080]  been on my radio show and I said brother your skin is like a child and he was
[1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:46.560]  laughing and like I really was hypnotized by it and and I said to his
[1:45:46.560 --> 1:45:51.360]  assistant I said how does he look so young and she said oh he does it was a
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:45:56.320]  record company somebody and they said well he does it's illegal now in England
[1:45:56.320 --> 1:46:02.080]  in America but he goes wherever he goes and he does fetal tissue yeah wow and I
[1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:05.160]  think that's what these people do they do they do stem cells they do fetal
[1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:11.040]  tissue and and I think it rejuvenates them well there's no there's no thinking
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:15.360]  about it that is exactly what's going on that's why the elites just want to
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:18.800]  bring in a world government cut off the resources get rid of the massive
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:21.760]  population because they're going to have the live extension technologies for
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:27.280]  themselves is that what all when we hear these undercover tapes of them making
[1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:31.400]  bargains on on you know baby parts at Planned Parenthood is that is that what
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:34.640]  this is Alex that's exactly in fact I've talked to Planned Parenthood people
[1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:38.360]  and I'm did a report on this about 18 years ago because we interviewed an
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:42.920]  insider actually George Willie a local Republican activist a Catholic activist
[1:46:42.920 --> 1:46:47.560]  got me in touch with them and they had the footage of some of this but they
[1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:51.880]  said no they sell the baby parts and they're getting upwards of $10,000 per
[1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:59.720]  baby for a late term abortion now this was in the mid 90s or like 97 or so the
[1:46:59.720 --> 1:47:05.040]  word is now if they can get an intact eight month old baby the woman pays
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:09.440]  thousands to have an abortion that late she has no idea that now the market's
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:14.680]  gotten so big they can get up to a hundred thousand dollars for the baby
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:20.520]  Alex think so so so encourage promiscuous sex you know ladies express
[1:47:20.520 --> 1:47:24.800]  yourself as much sex as possible it doesn't feel good if you were a condom
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:30.320]  you know an ultra sexual society that we have here I mean my god turn on
[1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:34.320]  anything and then make money off the babies that aren't wanted the vampires
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:38.080]  are having women farm their babies and have them pay for it when it's been
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:42.240]  fair to give the woman 50 grand I mean she could bring it in at nine months one
[1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:46.400]  day before it's due cut it out chop it up keep it alive sell its organs she
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:50.600]  could get a couple hundred grand I mean why not let the women start it is your
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:54.880]  bodies women how about you start growing babies for butcher it's not alive
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:59.960]  well I'm serious that's their extension I say women should have the right and as
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:04.360]  a feminist I am a feminist I think loria start to come out and advertise to a
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:08.640]  class action suit against Planned Parenthood for cheating women and not
[1:48:08.640 --> 1:48:14.840]  giving them money for the longhams that they're producing well you know this
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:19.120]  this whole thing that Obama spearheaded before he became Obama when I knew him
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:21.680]  when he was just called Barry here in Chicago I mean he was one of the guys
[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:25.720]  that fought for for late-term abortion and it's just interesting and look I
[1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:29.160]  have two 10-year-old daughters that you know and their premies I was a preemie
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:32.880]  now you could abort me and my kids and we wouldn't be considered alive it's
[1:48:32.880 --> 1:48:39.080]  interesting if there's a car accident in Chicago it's murder but if if you take
[1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:43.200]  that kid and you put them on they put them on metal shelves from Walmart these
[1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:45.840]  these cheap metal shelves and they put them there until they stop breathing
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:50.240]  because they can't resuscitate them Obama fought for that right so it's
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:53.720]  interesting if as they lay there sometimes 12 to 24 hours gasping for
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:58.880]  breath in the hospitals of Chicago that's not murder it's not alive but yet
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:04.560]  if you if you if you hit that woman Alex and a pregnant woman and she loses her
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:11.400]  baby you're a murderer more madness now you're absolutely right and this is
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:16.560]  dehumanization and it's mind control yeah Al Sharpton tells people what to be
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:22.200]  upset about and then when there's stuff happening thousands of times worse it's
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:25.800]  tonight on the radar you asked the question are the cops really our
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:33.640]  friends what's your take on that I was driving down the street in suburbia
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:39.480]  out outside of Chicago and my wife got pulled over and they wrote a ticket and
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:45.600]  she's crying and I said honey why are you crying she was I wasn't speeding I
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:51.520]  said no of course not it's your turn anytime a friend comes to visit in
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:54.640]  Chicago and we have cameras everywhere we have red light cameras I don't know if
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:58.400]  you have those in Austin yet but yes and they're right it's it's look we have a
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:02.360]  lot of programs to pay for and a lot of murderers to house and a lot of gang
[1:50:02.360 --> 1:50:08.040]  bangers to to get freebies to and so we get nickel and dime to death this is the
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:13.400]  town of Obama and Rahm Emanuel and daily and Jesse Jackson and Farrakhan can you
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:18.240]  imagine so the stealing never stops I said honey it's your it's your it's your
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:23.360]  turn you didn't do anything it's your turn and these people these cops Alex I
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:28.120]  I have paid to get tombstones for a hundred cops in Chicago I have dear
[1:50:28.120 --> 1:50:32.000]  friends that are cops but the guy that drives around all day stealing from
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.280]  housewives who's like a member of the IRS or he it's like he works for the
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:38.640]  sheriff of Nottingham sure you know brother I was I was taught the
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:42.400]  overhead overhead office for friendly wave and I love cops and I've done
[1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:46.800]  endless amounts of charity for cops but God it's getting hard to like him the
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:50.360]  woman from well here in Chicago that's what I'm saying it's it's hit or miss I
[1:50:50.360 --> 1:50:54.200]  totally agree some jurisdictions are just criminal street gangs than other
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:57.440]  jurisdictions really good people they'll be right back with man cow so how do we
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:51:05.080]  fix that earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:09.040]  war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better
[1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:13.040]  prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we
[1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:17.240]  address the need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking
[1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:21.560]  about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will

[1:51:29.320 --> 1:51:33.400]  you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without
[1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:37.600]  smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel

[2:00:09.800 --> 2:00:17.840]  answers well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live
[2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:24.320]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones. You know it's a teleprompter free radio TV show
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:30.320]  that Anko hosts every morning syndicated across the country and on local Fox
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:35.840]  television in Chicago but I tell you it's also heavily produced got a lot of
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:39.240]  fun stuff on the show and I've been a guest on there obviously many times in
[2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:43.760]  closing man cow and then I'm going to get into my review of specter we did a
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:46.920]  professional review of it I mentioned it it has like false flags they talk about
[2:00:46.920 --> 2:00:50.520]  the New World Order global government it just shows how far the liberty
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:54.920]  movements come what do you think the establishment's going to do as more and
[2:00:54.920 --> 2:00:58.840]  more of the thinking people realize how the scam really works I mean I have like
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:02.800]  high-powered political pundits in here talking about Jeb Bush and cocaine
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:06.440]  dealing you're on air talking about methamphetamine dealing it seems like
[2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:10.120]  everybody's turning against them the Pentagon is exposing that the government
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:14.920]  runs ISIS everybody's turning on Obama I want to say America is impressing me
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:21.000]  finding their wave hoes and standing up against evil oh man I you know Alex God
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.880]  you just you you kill me here because I have so much I want to say look specter
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:29.720]  was I really enjoyed it I did not the greatest movie of all time fantastic for
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:33.880]  they tried to turn urban and it failed and they went well what happened there
[2:01:33.880 --> 2:01:37.800]  they I saw the head of Sony was shocked that anyone would even acknowledge the
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:42.560]  new ghostbusters are female I'm telling you these these the political correct BS
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:46.120]  is going to fail do you know that Disney has now ordered that Princess Leia can
[2:01:46.120 --> 2:01:50.640]  never be shown as a slave you know the sexy bikini job of the hot slave girl
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:55.400]  outfit people know about and yeah and they and I have friends they're
[2:01:55.400 --> 2:01:59.320]  comic book artists no one's gonna see the ghostbusters with nothing but women
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:04.280]  because it's not about that they might they might I love the Chinese fighting
[2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:09.040]  to be better represented in our movies can you imagine some inner-city guy
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:13.560]  from Chicago yelling if he wants to be more represented in in China they would
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:15.800]  they would tell him get the hell out there I mean here's my deal I'm not
[2:02:15.800 --> 2:02:19.120]  against a franchise where it's about women being tough like Charlie's Angels
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:24.120]  or Alien that's how it starts it's why it's big but to it's like making Captain
[2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:28.600]  America black and having him take on the Tea Party it's just an it's a takeover
[2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:33.600]  it's like saying Robin Hood works for Prince John it's just not true well well
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:37.120]  look here's the thing formula works there's a reason we fall in love with
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:40.240]  these things and when they change him they fail and then everybody goes well
[2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:43.760]  what happened and nobody can acknowledge the obvious and people need to know go
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:48.280]  with your gut wrong is still wrong freaky is still freaky if you feel it in
[2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:51.600]  your gut if you hear it on this show and it's true guess what it's freaking true
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:56.520]  and if it doesn't it it will be proven true like those crazy football field
[2:02:56.520 --> 2:03:01.480]  sized blimps that are watching us I didn't believe you Alex my God and you
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:06.240]  were right and so you're right these movies are failing these TV shows are
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:11.200]  failing anything agenda driven is dying I can't wait to hear your take on the
[2:03:11.200 --> 2:03:16.040]  Bond movie and I do think a new world is coming not the world they want but a
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:21.320]  world that we want where love wins freedom wins and good wins and despite
[2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:25.000]  what you hear folks Alex will tell you because I know him he's a godly guy he's
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:29.120]  a good man he's a family man and he will tell you he's read the last chapter of
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:33.160]  the book I want everybody to know don't get don't get disenchanted don't get
[2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:40.880]  cynical don't get hateful good wins we win guys right Alex absolutely brother

[2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:47.120]  territory you know a lot of that's paid for I don't even really worry about it
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:52.000]  people anytime you're effective people want to demonize you because it makes
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:56.360]  them feel like they're big and powerful but I know 98% of what's said about me
[2:03:56.360 --> 2:04:00.960]  is a fraud the little bit of criticism that's accurate that I cut people off
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:06.560]  and I'm obnoxious that I'm repetitive is true and so I have really listened to
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:10.080]  that and gotten better so I take real criticism you know all day long and I
[2:04:10.080 --> 2:04:13.400]  know you do too listen you got to come back on more often I've asked you on

[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:16.760]  we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the
[2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:30.400]  resistance
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:35.480]  coming up more on the California missile test as we learn more on that front
[2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:44.480]  science news economic news Russian news political news it's all coming up also
[2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:48.440]  there's a hopeful article I don't know this is accurate but Sputnik's
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:52.920]  reporting US Congress likely to reject politically toxic TPP and there are
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:55.560]  members of Congress now that they're able to see it after it was passed
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:09:00.520]  globally now it has to be ratified here saying it is super draconian on so many
[2:09:00.520 --> 2:09:06.880]  fronts anti-free markets selective grip shuts down free speech it's all coming
[2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:12.160]  up and I meant to cover this yesterday we just pull me the article San Francisco
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:16.200]  bans fireplaces first they restricted them now they banned them outright I
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:24.480]  told you that's agenda 21 banning lemonade stands banning any small groups
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:29.080]  of humans engaging a non-corporate activity it's all living basically in a
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:35.680]  giant prison that's them proposing banning it it's now banned in all new
[2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:41.080]  homes and they're harassing and finding people caught with smoke coming out
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:46.520]  their chimney now it's now it's your your restaurant putting smoke out which is
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:49.840]  part of the atmosphere so that's all coming up we're also going to look at
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:53.880]  something you can do to fight the globalists in a big way with dr. group
[2:09:53.880 --> 2:09:58.040]  here on the transmission something that the establishment really doesn't want
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:00.640]  people to be aware of because it's something you can actually do for
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:09.720]  yourself now there's the article by Joe Wolverston the second new American
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:14.520]  wood burning stuffs banned in new homes in San Francisco area boom and that's
[2:10:14.520 --> 2:10:17.120]  the environmental protection agency working with the locals to do that
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:23.880]  that's all you in but first here is my analysis and breakdown on the new film
[2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:34.320]  specter well the new James Bond movies been out in the United States for more
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:40.280]  than a week James Bond specter with Daniel Craig first off I like Daniel
[2:10:40.280 --> 2:10:44.640]  Craig as an actor but I really didn't like him as James Bond in the last few
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:49.160]  films and quite frankly the previous films I only watched for their
[2:10:49.160 --> 2:10:54.360]  entertainment value as unintentional comedy now some of the Ian Fleming books
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:59.480]  he was a high-level MI6 spy are very interesting and have well let's just say
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:05.040]  plots that parallel reality like moon raker an elite plan to biologically
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:09.960]  wipe out 99% of the human race and repopulate it with superhumans that's
[2:11:09.960 --> 2:11:15.200]  a globalist eugenicist plan that's been on the drawing board for more than 60
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:21.960]  years but most of the stuff you see in James Bond movies is pro anti-terrorism
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:29.920]  police state propaganda it's British crown MI6 MI5 police state promotion that
[2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:37.240]  said I went and saw last week specter and it is undoubtedly the best James Bond
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:43.480]  movie I've ever seen for the action the adventure but mainly the content without
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:48.520]  giving away too much I'll just say this it basically discredits the police state
[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:53.760]  spy grid the NSA spy grid the British spy grid the European spy grid the
[2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:59.120]  global spy grid and explains that spy grids end up being used against the
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:04.000]  system itself and are used by criminals to oppress the people and that
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:10.320]  criminals are using staged terror attacks or false flag terror attacks
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:17.280]  self-inflicted wounds inside jobs to force governments themselves to acquiesce
[2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:25.760]  to the NSA style surveillance grid so this is a very pro Snowden film it's
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:30.280]  also a very nationalistic film it's very pro nation state explaining that
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:36.880]  countries are firewalls against one great tyranny or one great ring in the
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:43.560]  darkness binding us all now earlier I talked about previous James Bond films
[2:12:43.560 --> 2:12:49.680]  basically being comedy and they are but one vein that runs through the franchise
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:12:56.360]  since the early 60s when Sean Connery first starred as the MI6 hero is the
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:13:02.760]  fact that there are shadowy organizations like specter or chaos or Cobra or
[2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:07.880]  Hydra that have operatives within government that use government
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:14.200]  compartmentalization to basically turn government into nothing but automatons
[2:13:14.200 --> 2:13:22.680]  or engines of their criminal enterprises extortion murder mass terrorism but
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:29.480]  this film ties it all together and shows how specter symbolized by the octopus or
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:36.200]  by the Hydra is actually in control of every major government on earth and when
[2:13:36.200 --> 2:13:41.520]  you realize what Bilderberg what Club of Rome is you understand that literally
[2:13:41.520 --> 2:13:47.920]  that's what globalism and the new world order is is private corporate operatives
[2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:52.200]  who've given themselves diplomatic immunity through the UN and other
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:59.160]  multinational governmental organizations who are actually funding ISIS actually
[2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:04.520]  funding currency devaluations actually funding right-wing terrorist groups in
[2:14:04.520 --> 2:14:09.920]  Ukraine actually having CNN endorse the Muslim brotherhood while they blow up and
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:14.920]  burn down churches in Egypt and when you pull back and realize that specter like
[2:14:14.920 --> 2:14:20.160]  a face sucker from alien is in control of our major governments and has us
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:27.200]  hatching out new legions of tyrants for them you understand what the new world
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:33.680]  order is and why it once and above the law global cashless society controlled
[2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:40.760]  by a corporate oligarchy this film is excellent it's extremely informative and
[2:14:40.760 --> 2:14:46.800]  on so many fronts it's revolutionary and when you investigate it organizations
[2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:52.280]  like Goldman Sachs admit that they're installing their executives as the
[2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:57.840]  presidents of major countries like Italy Greece and other nations it is
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:04.880]  simply over the top in summation what does a film like specter tell us it
[2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:09.120]  tells us a lot there are people inside the system that don't like what's
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:12.560]  happening and are trying to use art to not just be propagandist for the
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:17.520]  establishment but to tell the truth or maybe they're still propagandist for the
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:21.000]  establishment but they realize that the public's already woken up to what's
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:25.280]  happening so at least they give us simulated victories in movies in the
[2:15:25.280 --> 2:15:29.400]  matrix so we feel like everything's okay that's the more pessimistic view I
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:34.520]  tend to think it's a little bit above but what we do know is the world is
[2:15:34.520 --> 2:15:39.840]  waking up the world is taking action the world is saying no and real life
[2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:44.760]  James Bond's in local government in state government in federal government in
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:49.240]  multinational government in international systems from the top to the
[2:15:49.240 --> 2:15:55.600]  bottom are saying no are waking up and are realizing the paradigm that we're
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:00.040]  in a controlled manipulated system and they're beginning to break out of that
[2:16:00.040 --> 2:16:05.120]  matrix and it's not just movies like James Bond specter in 2015 that are
[2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:10.080]  telling the truth no my friends it's films like the last captain America
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:15.840]  where again a shadowy criminal group another octopus Hydra has its operatives
[2:16:15.840 --> 2:16:20.600]  within government multi-nationally and is bringing in a global tyranny in the
[2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:25.320]  name of protecting the public from terrorist they run in control some
[2:16:25.320 --> 2:16:29.960]  people will rightly ask me why are you covering fiction why are you giving
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:36.400]  Hollywood blockbuster movies a review why are you telling us go see it because
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:41.880]  when we vote with our dollars when Hollywood does something good we should
[2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:47.560]  support it that's Pavlovian conditioning to produce more that's
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:53.440]  enlightening more that's informative yes we have a stick as well but the carrot
[2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:57.880]  is the real way to change society that's why they want to end free spatial
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:00.960]  political correctness that's why they want review boards to control what you
[2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:05.120]  can say because they don't want an open market of ideas because freedom is
[2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:10.720]  popular we simply need to legalize freedom again I spend 95% of my time
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:15.520]  promoting alternative media new media independent films but when a film comes
[2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:21.280]  along like Captain America or when a film comes along like equilibrium a
[2:17:21.280 --> 2:17:26.320]  decade ago or some of the other films like the Hunger Games exposing the
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:30.440]  police state we've got to promote the good aspects of it and a lot of times
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:35.320]  I'll give a film two or three stars out of five if it did an okay job or two or
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:40.880]  three Paul Revere is out of five rarely do I give a film five stars but I've
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:47.040]  got to say despite some of its problems this film gets four and a half stars it
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:52.800]  loses half a star because they act like MI six are the good guys completely and
[2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:57.640]  they're totally fighting evil and are perfect when the truth is if there was
[2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:03.800]  one organization that I had to say was specter like it would be MI six MI five
[2:18:03.800 --> 2:18:08.880]  or the Central Intelligence Agency and that's because they're so big they're
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:14.520]  so old they're so powerful as a British statesman said Lord Acton power tends to
[2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:19.160]  corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely so these are organizations
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:22.800]  where the cleaning of house needs to happen of course I don't think these
[2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:28.720]  organizations should be abolished and you can say in summation that this kind of
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:34.480]  is a PR film for MI six that is under scrutiny right now inside the UK so
[2:18:34.480 --> 2:18:39.200]  that's probably the one little poison kernel within the larger mountain of
[2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:49.800]  truth that's it for this review of specter and a final point I should add to
[2:18:49.800 --> 2:18:53.720]  that excellent piece that Rob do put together from a little talk I did last
[2:18:53.720 --> 2:18:57.920]  night here he did it pretty quick is that we're also hijacking mainstream media
[2:18:57.920 --> 2:19:03.600]  hijacking culture hijacking means in the next hour we'll upload that eight
[2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:08.520]  minute review to info wars dot com to Facebook to Twitter to present planet

[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:16.680]  overdrive and debate coverage tonight from like six o'clock all the way up
[2:25:16.680 --> 2:25:20.000]  until like 10 o'clock because I think we should have pre-debate coverage they're
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:23.160]  all ready to go at seven but I think pre-debates even better we're gonna have
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:27.800]  Jakari Jackson Kit Daniels on the ground at the University up there in Missouri
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:32.560]  where free speech is being trampled by bizarre French Revolution style
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:38.640]  Jacobin bizarreness we've got all that coming up but Dr. Group joins us for the
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:41.360]  balance of the sour talk about solutions we have them up every couple
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:45.440]  weeks we have been trying to launch this for the last year we got all of the
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:49.800]  organic ingredients to do it so this is part infomercial we always alert people
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:54.640]  when we do this every few weeks but it's also mainly just free info because
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:58.960]  people need to know how many parasites and other harmful invasive organisms are
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:03.720]  in the body even the government admits nine out of ten people are infested with
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:07.960]  harmful organisms and we've come out with a new living defense harmful
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:13.200]  organism cleansing dietary supplement and it is extremely affordable it is
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:18.160]  brimming with the capsules and the way I read the facts this could do a cleanse
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:22.560]  for really a family of four or five people Dr. Group let's just get into the
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:25.920]  product now and then into parasites themselves what folks really want to hear
[2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:30.000]  about in the next segment but thank you for developing this for infowarslife.com
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:34.360]  tell us about living defense and why it's so special well it's it's really
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:38.400]  special because it's part of the problem that we're dealing with today when the
[2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:43.760]  earth becomes sick and the earth soils become acidic and the internal bodies
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:48.560]  become acidic because of all the toxic food in the air and the beverages that
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:53.520]  people are consuming it sets up an environment that's right for harmful
[2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:58.440]  organisms to live either on the earth that's why a lot of the plants are
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:03.200]  infested with harmful organisms or inside the body and years ago we linked
[2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:08.760]  every single disease process to an overgrowth of organisms in the body and
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:14.440]  when people hear the word parasite which the FDA does not like us to use they
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:18.600]  actually came down on us and made us take the word parasite off everywhere
[2:27:18.600 --> 2:27:23.840]  because we were exposing what the globalists have been doing spreading
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:30.240]  these parasites and creating this hostile this environment which is great for
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:34.000]  them to live in for years and years and years because they know they drain us of
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:39.960]  energy they make us sick so we had to actually change the word parasite to
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:45.640]  harmful organism and when we talk about harmful organisms it's the definition
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:52.120]  actually the medical definition of parasite is any harmful organism that
[2:27:52.120 --> 2:27:57.720]  lives off of a host mechanism most people just think parasites are worms but
[2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:03.440]  harmful organisms are bacteria viruses that you can get through flu shots
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:08.680]  funguses yeast we literally have an epidemic going on right now with molds
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:14.520]  and fungus and yeast living in everybody's body worms bacteria so any
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:20.920]  organism that's harmful that's living off or living in your body stealing your
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:27.600]  nutrients creating an acidic environment because what we found with the
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:32.480]  research that was done in the 1920s 30s 50s Royal Raymond Rife who developed a
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:40.280]  light microscope who could actually view organisms at 100,000 X associated and
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:44.920]  identified organisms with every single disease and that's when he came up with
[2:28:44.920 --> 2:28:48.320]  the Rife machine which blew back frequencies at these organisms and
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:54.280]  would blow them up because every organism resonates at a certain frequency so it
[2:28:54.280 --> 2:29:00.200]  wasn't only him but our scientists German scientists they knew the effect that
[2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:06.000]  they could initiate inside the body by exposing the earth and exposing
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:10.800]  everybody to harmful parasites the bad thing about parasites or harmful
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:16.920]  organisms is that there really is no medical tests to determine so you could
[2:29:16.920 --> 2:29:22.360]  have a host of symptoms and be misdiagnosed by doctor after doctor after
[2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:26.040]  doctor after doctor stay there let's let's talk about it when we come back
[2:29:26.040 --> 2:29:29.760]  what is the best testing for parasites is one of the questions we'll go over
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:33.560]  what are some of the most common parasites that people suffer from we'll
[2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:37.200]  look at those little guys and then we'll look at one of the most deadly parasites
[2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:42.520]  known Hillary Clinton or harmful invasive organism from Mars they'll be back
[2:29:42.520 --> 2:29:47.160]  stay with us or is it Venus or is it Pluto or is it Uranus we'll be back
[2:29:47.160 --> 2:29:56.320]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:56.320 --> 2:30:02.720]  the Italian government attempted to cover up the arrest of a convicted al-Qaeda
[2:30:02.720 --> 2:30:07.000]  terrorist who tried to enter the country on a migrant boat last month German
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:12.400]  media reports according to NTV the arrest of the Tunisian-born suspect who
[2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:17.200]  was sentenced to seven years in 2007 for plotting multiple terror attacks was
[2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:21.520]  initially hidden by authorities over fears that it would stop panic the
[2:30:21.520 --> 2:30:26.160]  suspect who was arrested at sea while traveling with more than 200 migrants
[2:30:26.160 --> 2:30:31.000]  told police he was seeking asylum in Europe in order to escape persecution
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:36.120]  after providing a false name following several days of interrogation by police
[2:30:36.120 --> 2:30:41.280]  the suspect was deported back to Tunisia and handed over to local authorities as
[2:30:41.280 --> 2:30:45.640]  noted by the independent the alleged attempt to cover up the arrest was
[2:30:45.640 --> 2:30:49.560]  likely rooted in the Italian interior ministers claim that there was no
[2:30:49.560 --> 2:30:53.560]  evidence that Islamic terrorists were sneaking into Europe aboard migrant

[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:01.680]  Leanne McAdu it'll be myself David Knight Joe Biggs a Darren McBreen is
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:04.680]  going to be manning the Twitter station so everyone needs to be sure they're
[2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:08.640]  interacting with us sending us their tweets use the main hashtag it'll be
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:13.600]  GOP debate but we definitely like to take over that hashtag and it'll be fun
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:18.360]  political science theater 3000 and let's be clear people love these we end up on
[2:34:18.360 --> 2:34:21.800]  average just on the streams getting about 200,000 people that tune into it then
[2:34:21.800 --> 2:34:25.720]  we have about 130,000 that tuned in on the live YouTube stream we sent it out
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:29.400]  there and some other systems but that's that's pretty good for us I mean you
[2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:33.160]  look at the radio show with millions of viewers took 20 years to build that with
[2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:37.320]  viewers and listeners but to have an extra couple hundred thousand people just
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:41.640]  on the streams not to mention on Houston cable and some other stations that are
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:45.200]  already picking up the show very very exciting I would say all total probably
[2:34:45.200 --> 2:34:48.840]  a million people will be watching our coverage and and that really gives a
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:52.280]  challenge to establishment media who doesn't even have viewership like that
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:56.560]  except when they have a debate we saw the circus a few weeks ago what do you
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:00.160]  think Fox News will do this time well I think it's gonna be pretty interesting
[2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:05.360]  because obviously their GOP's main guy right now is in the crosshairs so it'll
[2:35:05.360 --> 2:35:08.040]  be interesting but I think they're gonna be talking I think they're going to try
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:14.120]  and maintain decorum so that they don't become the they don't become the the
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:20.040]  sensational news that their failure of the moderators so and to be clear we do
[2:35:20.040 --> 2:35:25.600]  something nobody else does right okay we do live analysis of mainstream media
[2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:30.040]  fair use to document what they're saying and they're doing and literally under
[2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:34.560]  the legal parameters that's why we only show part of it we talk over it we give
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:38.440]  analysis just like we could do to any other big live event that's news wise
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:44.760]  right we couldn't do a live commentary on the NFL we're doing this on politicians
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:49.840]  on the media on what's happening nobody else does this we do this of state of
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:54.880]  the unions I started doing this like 15 years ago or I'd carry it live and make
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:35:58.600]  comments and so that's what's coming up tonight because we get some complaints it's
[2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:01.480]  a minority of folks they're like what are you doing talking over the debate well
[2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:06.000]  it's it's a Fox debate not an info wars debate we're analyzing the media and
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:09.880]  we're analyzing the politicians right and we're analyzing the response in
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:14.200]  live time that's what we're doing under the First Amendment breaking it down
[2:36:14.200 --> 2:36:20.240]  same way we would analyze a political commercial mm-hmm or another news piece
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:24.760]  that we have absolutely so so have Fox news on right beside it and go back and
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:27.760]  forth but but that's why you want to become a prison planet dot TV member

[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:15.040]  democratizing the debate right yeah we don't just need to listen to what
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:18.880]  they're feeding us but let's you know break through the lies and disinformation
[2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:22.680]  and not let them put out establishment spin of what the debate meant exactly

[2:38:35.200 --> 2:38:39.120]  product to get into parasites themselves what's in it because I've always
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:44.000]  read and heard that just one of the ingredients black walnuts you know is
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:48.400]  really good at flushing parasites and then you know animals out in the fields
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:52.960]  eat them and stuff to naturally do this so we we do cleanses on our dogs our
[2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:58.480]  cats our horses our cows why not us well because they don't want you to know
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:02.920]  about that you need to do a parasite or a harmful organism cleanse that's the
[2:39:02.920 --> 2:39:06.520]  thing it's so secretive and when we were doing our research into the root cause
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:11.400]  of every single disease there's been plenty of proof a lot of it's been
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:17.360]  burned and gotten rid of over the years that the majority of diseases are
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:22.000]  caused by some sort of overgrowth of harmful organisms in the body as a
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:26.080]  matter of fact a world worth world health organization came out a couple
[2:39:26.080 --> 2:39:32.120]  years ago and said 3.5 billion people are infested with intestinal parasites and
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:37.560]  worms so the problem that we found is if you with cancer patients for example we
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:44.040]  found up over a trillion microorganisms harmful in each person's body we
[2:39:44.040 --> 2:39:48.680]  calculated that out and other scientists have as well well if you have a
[2:39:48.680 --> 2:39:54.120]  trillion harmful organisms in your body they all take your nutrients and feed
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:39:57.960]  off of you and then they have to go to the bathroom and that's where the real
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:40:01.800]  problem comes in first of all they take they steal all the good stuff from you
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:05.160]  and then second of all they process it and then they go to the bathroom inside
[2:40:05.160 --> 2:40:09.360]  your system we turn into portable porta-potties you do because they secrete
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:16.560]  formaldehyde isopropyl alcohol phenol very toxic substances that are also
[2:40:16.560 --> 2:40:21.600]  endocrine disrupting chemicals and alter the hormone levels in your body as well
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:27.920]  so I mean parasites live in the food for example one square inch of sushi can
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:33.200]  contain over 10,000 parasite larvae how many people do you know out there that
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:41.720]  eat sushi so yeah I mean over 75 percent of the world's population has at
[2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:45.840]  least one type of worm living inside the videos with the worms come out of the
[2:40:45.840 --> 2:40:52.200]  pork chops oh I've seen so many different videos on parasites there are
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:57.720]  some colonoscopy videos out there I mean a lot of times they find tape worms hook
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:02.720]  worms during routine colonoscopy and you can go on YouTube and type in colonoscopy
[2:41:02.720 --> 2:41:10.160]  worms there's been tape worms that they found that have been 60 feet long 60
[2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:15.400]  feet long so it's not just a third world problem you know you always hear about
[2:41:15.400 --> 2:41:19.000]  oh don't go to the third world countries because you're gonna get worms you're
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:24.080]  gonna get parasites eight out of ten children under 12 have pinworms adults
[2:41:24.080 --> 2:41:30.440]  have pinworms they they spread like wildfire you know we all we live in a
[2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:34.280]  toxic environment like I said you can even breathe what about what cats carry
[2:41:34.280 --> 2:41:37.960]  I heard some countries like India half the population has brain worms that
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:41.960]  causes mass mental illness and it actually the parasite in the brain
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:46.760]  programs you to like the smell of cat urine to keep the cats around similar to
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:52.480]  worms that get into caterpillars and program them to go up and be killed by
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:56.960]  birds to then spread the worms faster it's like a science fiction movie in fact
[2:41:56.960 --> 2:42:01.160]  people won't believe it go to YouTube and type in parasite worms take over
[2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:05.280]  caterpillars and it actually shows it goes to its brain takes control of it
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:09.880]  makes it go to the top of a leaf to be eaten by birds I mean this is why are
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:13.480]  you against the migrant parasites that want to eat our brains why are you
[2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:16.760]  against the amoebas that want to eat the brain why don't you submit to the
[2:42:16.760 --> 2:42:23.280]  amoeba it has a right to live to racist because it's all about clearing our
[2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:27.440]  brain and raising the consciousness and giving people the solutions and finding
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:36.080]  out what's wrong out there that's why everybody more cats intestinal cleansing
[2:42:36.080 --> 2:42:41.040]  liver and gallbladder cleansing harmful organism cleansing chemical and heavy
[2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:45.080]  metal cleansing and now you have everything everybody needs Alex this is
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:49.080]  the last part I mean yes there's a lot of other supplements out there but this
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:54.480]  is the key I mean hold the Clark she she associated most diseases with the
[2:42:54.480 --> 2:42:59.000]  liver fluke I mean you can trace everything from migraine headaches to
[2:42:59.000 --> 2:43:04.240]  arthritis everything wrong with worms that go into the brain and remote
[2:43:04.240 --> 2:43:07.720]  control you that fact that's BBC Associated Press we just showed an
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:11.040]  article I only knew about this a few years ago my son told me about it I
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:14.400]  didn't know there were parasites that literally take control of their host and
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:20.040]  control you like a robot you know what the scary thing is DARPA and some of the
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:26.880]  the black ops organizations have actually been working on an artificial
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:31.480]  intelligent parasites that they can put inside your system they want they want
[2:43:31.480 --> 2:43:36.440]  insects liver nanotech yeah and you can activate certain parasites with
[2:43:36.440 --> 2:43:40.800]  electric with frequencies using the harp technology using cell phone towers you
[2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:44.240]  can turn them on you can make them more active you can turn them off if you
[2:43:44.240 --> 2:43:49.040]  infest the world's population with harmful organisms and you know what
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:53.480]  frequencies activate those harmful organisms or destroy those harmful
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:58.760]  organisms that's exactly what royal rife proved he he measured the frequencies
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:02.880]  and the harmonics of all the organisms and blew back the same frequency and
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:08.000]  they would explode but you can also enhance those frequencies or control
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:12.560]  those organisms with frequencies and anybody that does have cats or dogs or
[2:44:12.560 --> 2:44:17.600]  around animals all the time they need to be doing harmful organism cleanses on a
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:23.040]  regular basis so that's the reason why I'm so I've had so many people that have
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:27.400]  come to me thousands and thousands that have said they've gone to 20 different
[2:44:27.400 --> 2:44:31.200]  doctors and no doctor can figure out what's wrong with them and they've all
[2:44:31.200 --> 2:44:35.640]  been labeled with some sort of mental illness it's not that parasites can get
[2:44:35.640 --> 2:44:40.000]  up in your brain when they secrete all these chemicals and then you combine all
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.720]  the chemicals and the toxins from the food you're eating and the and the heavy
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:48.000]  metals you're ingesting and all the toxic beverages you're consuming and
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:51.680]  you're not cleansing your body and all these things are congesting your
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:57.400]  self-healing mechanism and reducing your immune system this is the answer that
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:01.280]  we're trying to give to people it is all about cleansing and changing let's go
[2:45:01.280 --> 2:45:04.240]  over because it's not just getting the product living defense that you
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:08.840]  developed from forest life calm go about eating a garlic raw garlic pumpkin seeds
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:12.640]  pomegranates beets carrots all of which have been traditional to kill parasites
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:17.240]  and then you go through some studies you talk about nutrition supplements and
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:22.040]  cutting back on raw carbohydrates I want to go through probiotics all about it
[2:45:22.040 --> 2:45:27.400]  but tell us you try to develop living defense to be the strongest safest
[2:45:27.400 --> 2:45:32.440]  focused herbal combination of some of our products obviously you don't smell too
[2:45:32.440 --> 2:45:36.520]  good why does this smell so delicious everybody loves it and tell folks what's
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:41.120]  in living defense at infowarslife.com well it probably smells good because of
[2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:46.240]  the clothes so when we were we we spent years and tested this formula for years
[2:45:46.240 --> 2:45:52.360]  and years and years and we've chosen the specific herbs to address a wide
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:57.720]  variety there's millions of harmful organisms out there there's some that
[2:45:57.720 --> 2:46:02.000]  are more damaging to the body there's a lot of different worms also as well so
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:08.880]  we had to pick different types of herbs that would focus on the most damaging
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:15.120]  harmful organisms and not only create a hostile environment for those harmful
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:19.280]  organisms but also help the body naturally eliminate those harmful
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:24.560]  organisms so we chose epizote which is has been used for years we chose
[2:46:24.560 --> 2:46:32.480]  cassia bark we also wanted to source the cleanest strongest therapeutic doses so
[2:46:32.480 --> 2:46:37.760]  we looked for organic first if we couldn't find certified organic sources
[2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:43.360]  the next thing we always do is go to wild crafted in the rainforest which are to
[2:46:43.360 --> 2:46:48.520]  me just as good as certified organic because no one's touched those trees or
[2:46:48.520 --> 2:46:53.280]  no one's touched those herbs sounds even better so yeah a lot of times they are
[2:46:53.280 --> 2:46:58.600]  even better so then we put organic clove butt in there we put wormwood you know
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:03.520]  you can see wormwood that's why they call it wormwood is it's been used as far
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:10.560]  back as 1600 BC for as a cleansing herb or to create a hostile environment for
[2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:17.120]  harmful organisms and then we put a real powerful enzyme blend in because a lot of
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:23.400]  the harmful organisms out there have adapted over time and our immune system
[2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:28.120]  our macrophages in our immune system which are like our pac-man which go in
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:33.520]  there and chew a lot of these harmful organisms up they these harmful
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:37.920]  organisms have a layer it's called a chitin layers it's a it's a hard layer
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:41.320]  that they've developed over time to protect themselves from our immune
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:46.360]  system so not too many companies out there know that you really need to start
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:50.680]  breaking down these layers that those organisms especially different types of
[2:47:50.680 --> 2:47:56.240]  yeast and fungus and worms have developed this protective layer and so we put a
[2:47:56.240 --> 2:48:02.000]  special blend of enzymes in the living defense that are designed to chew away
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:08.800]  and eat at this layer to make them more vulnerable to the herbs that we're using
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:13.680]  in here and not only that but also to the macrophages your own immune system so
[2:48:13.680 --> 2:48:18.600]  it's really a combination of a lot of different things in the living defense
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:26.040]  that people can use I recommend doing a six-week cleanse because as you study as
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:30.440]  we've studied the lifecycle of the majority of harmful organisms especially
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:36.680]  different types of worms from the time that they lay eggs it takes six weeks
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:42.120]  for them to fully mature into adults so anybody who's doing a harmful organism
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:46.360]  cleanse should really do it for a period of six weeks it's one of the easiest
[2:48:46.360 --> 2:48:50.520]  cleanses to do Alex it's not like the liver cleanse or the intestinal cleanse
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:54.880]  I mean this is a very easy cleanse all it does all you're doing is just taking
[2:48:54.880 --> 2:49:01.560]  capsules twice a day and that's it you know we also recommend looking at some
[2:49:01.560 --> 2:49:07.960]  of the dietary changes trying to avoid sushi or if you do eat sushi that night
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:12.700]  you would want to take three capsules when you get home just to kill off or to
[2:49:12.700 --> 2:49:17.280]  eliminate any of the larvae that might be in the sushi so it's really one of
[2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:24.200]  the catalyst most effective programs that we've used and other doctors have
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:29.240]  used for years and years and years and it's one of the things that I feel is a
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:35.800]  vital part it's a vital component of you getting your health back to where it
[2:49:35.800 --> 2:49:40.680]  needs to be because a lot of doctors natural practitioners out there they
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:44.200]  do a little bit of cleansing or they prescribe a lot of herbs to everybody
[2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:49.000]  they address the symptoms but what we're focusing on is the root cause we're
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:53.800]  focusing on what the damaging areas are and I've had people that have turned into
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:58.360]  vegan and juice all day long every day and they still have health problems and
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:50:03.480]  I'll ask them did you do a harmful organism cleanse did you cleanse all the
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:07.480]  harmful organisms out of your body because those organisms you can juice as
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:11.920]  much as you want but those harmful organisms are still going to be sucking
[2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:15.600]  in all those nutrients from the juice unless you've been able to eliminate
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:20.200]  those from your body well humans have been plagued by harmful organisms it's
[2:50:20.200 --> 2:50:23.280]  like we live on a college campus with all the political correct terms things we
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:29.840]  have to use but obviously there are invasive creatures insects worms other
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:35.280]  families different types of microbes amoebas that are out there and you know
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:38.320]  you can get in Lake Travis every year somebody ends up dying when one goes up
[2:50:38.320 --> 2:50:41.440]  their nose and eats their brain you know replicates in their brain but I can't
[2:50:41.440 --> 2:50:47.040]  call it a parasite I it's a loving sweetie pie there that's more politically
[2:50:47.040 --> 2:50:52.120]  correct a migrant the amoebas migrate into the brain obviously something like
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:56.000]  this is gonna help you with that but I don't think it's a good idea I don't
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:59.120]  think you should cleanse your intestines folks keep the parasites we use
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:02.560]  mobile devices right against our bodies every day but growing scientific
[2:51:02.560 --> 2:51:05.920]  evidence has emerged showing serious health risks associated with exposure

[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:36.480]  Every culture throughout history has tried to do
[2:54:36.480 --> 2:54:42.480]  cleanses to get parasites out of their box and the West is better off on
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:46.200]  average than third world countries were what I've read mainline news most
[2:54:46.200 --> 2:54:51.080]  adults have really bad parasites and just accepted there's still a lot of
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:58.400]  parasites here and I know that I'm gonna start taking living defense as
[2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:03.080]  recommended because everything else that Dr. Groups developed from Forrest
[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:06.800]  Life dot com whether it's the deep cleanse or whether it's the oxy powder
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:10.280]  or whether it's the liver shield or whether it's a survival shield nason
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:16.160]  iodine x2 all of it has been amazing and what's good on top of it is your
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:20.920]  funding a hardcore Liberty based operation that promotes freedom so in
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:27.240]  Forrest Life dot com or 888 2533139 and again I don't plug every segment like
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:30.440]  other talk show hosts to I'm not knocking it radio has to do it radio's in
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:34.720]  trouble the economy's in trouble we just every other week or so do a 30 minute
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:38.360]  you know infomercial and they're open about it and fund ourselves and we
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:42.360]  recommend radio stations out there get your own high quality products and start
[2:55:42.360 --> 2:55:46.360]  doing this with your local shows this is the game changer michael's whirlings
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:51.440]  here he's got two stations in the central area of California two big ones
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:57.880]  one goes into Cal in in San Francisco and he trailblazed stations 20 years
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:56:01.440]  ago self-funding by selling their own products and he's doing better than
[2:56:01.440 --> 2:56:04.520]  ever when his competitions going out of business some of the biggest stations in
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:09.200]  California so I'm thinking about becoming a consultant for free and maybe
[2:56:09.200 --> 2:56:14.240]  writing a handbook up for stations and try to give them tips because it's not
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:18.560]  enough to get ratings nowadays the you know the economy's in so much trouble so
[2:56:18.560 --> 2:56:23.960]  it's a win-win to buy the product it's available in fours life comm living
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:28.720]  defense and it is an introductory rollout it will sell out it'll be next
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:35.840]  year till we get more dr. group shifting gears in other countries they obsess
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:41.160]  over parasite cleanses like Japan other developed nations here I never heard
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:46.040]  anything about this until I started hanging around with some more wealthy
[2:56:46.040 --> 2:56:49.280]  people that are into health conscious and they said you've never gone to the
[2:56:49.280 --> 2:56:53.040]  doctor had your blood tested for parasites just because they can you know
[2:56:53.040 --> 2:56:56.080]  see what toxins the parasites put off and tell you what types you've got and
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:56:59.880]  then they were showing me like photos of what their kids had and what they had and
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:04.600]  it was just crazy and they were going to MDs so we can criticize MDs here
[2:57:04.600 --> 2:57:08.400]  they're not really bad in most cases they're just compartmentalized but am I
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:12.320]  wrong in saying more and more MDs are aware of this and there's a growing
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:17.840]  market in MD science as well identifying the fact that parasites and also
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:23.960]  funguses things like that are yeast are just absolutely infesting us
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:28.520]  yeast is one of the things it's really going rampant right now in mold and
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:32.640]  candida I mean but then you have strange parasites like more gallons to where
[2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:37.840]  where people are having these these strings basically growing out of their
[2:57:37.840 --> 2:57:43.560]  skin but you have to remember that let's say some of the more common symptoms of
[2:57:43.560 --> 2:57:50.320]  parasite would be abdominal pain diarrhea nausea vomiting gas bloating
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:55.840]  loose stools a lot of skin conditions rashes on the skin are associated with
[2:57:55.840 --> 2:58:02.600]  harmful organisms stomach pain weight gain weight gain unexplained is a lot of
[2:58:02.600 --> 2:58:08.840]  times associated with parasites depression stress anxiety so a lot of
[2:58:08.840 --> 2:58:12.440]  these symptoms people go to the doctor's office and what is the standard doctor
[2:58:12.440 --> 2:58:17.600]  going to do I'm going to describe a medications they want people hooked on
[2:58:17.600 --> 2:58:22.040]  medications they're not gonna they're not going to link all these symptoms to
[2:58:22.040 --> 2:58:27.160]  parasites I why I don't know we did because we looked at the root cause of
[2:58:27.160 --> 2:58:32.080]  everything which was toxicity in the body hold on hold on do five more minutes

[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:54.320]  inside your body and they can start to decay or be in there for a little while
[3:02:54.320 --> 3:02:58.120]  until your immune system can flush them out so it's really good to drink a lot
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  of extra water exercise get your blood moving and push all those out also
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:08.200]  recommend that people do intestinal cleansing on a regular basis liver and
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:13.320]  gallbladder cleansing but all in all it's a it's results driven i mean we all
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:17.120]  have to understand that we live in a world where we're exposed to parasites
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:22.240]  all the time i'm almost scared to do it i did a we have but but it's not that bad
[3:03:22.240 --> 3:03:25.400]  trust me i mean the liver cleanse is probably the hardest out of all the
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:30.560]  cleanses and it's easy for me it was easy for me yeah 99% of the people when
[3:03:30.560 --> 3:03:34.760]  they do a harmful organism cleanse maybe for the first few days they might be a
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:39.800]  little lethargic but after that they're able to slowly eliminate and their body
[3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:45.160]  starts their immune system starts to be built back up and they naturally get
[3:03:45.160 --> 3:03:50.120]  rid of these things why are you racist against pinworms hookworms tapeworms
[3:03:50.120 --> 3:03:55.600]  amoebas and other things why were you raised a bigot you should accept it
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:00.640]  well the thing is there are good organisms to the live in our bodies and
[3:04:00.640 --> 3:04:04.920]  that's you know it's the it's always the fight against good and bad right so you
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:10.200]  want to have the as many good organisms in your body some of the good things all
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:14.000]  your probiotics your bio dome inside your intestinal lining those are going to

[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:25.920]  what we want to do is we want to have the good heart organisms in our body
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:30.280]  fighting against the bad organisms in our body it's like it's weird we have
[3:04:30.280 --> 3:04:34.280]  the same scenario in our lives but we all look at the environment look at a
[3:04:34.280 --> 3:04:38.520]  forest look at a desert it's all got that balance of stuff going on in it

[3:04:51.960 --> 3:04:55.280]  get out there I mean when I think about how sensational this is if we expose
[3:04:55.280 --> 3:05:00.600]  this it could really damage the globalist a proposed EU law puts the
[3:05:00.600 --> 3:05:05.240]  simple act of linking to content under copyright protection Julia Retta a
[3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:09.480]  German activist puts it this way the European Commission is preparing a
[3:05:09.480 --> 3:05:13.800]  frontal attack on the hyperlink the basic building block of the internet as we
[3:05:13.800 --> 3:05:19.760]  know it this is based on an absurd idea that just won't die making search
[3:05:19.760 --> 3:05:23.880]  engines and news portals pay media companies for promoting their freely
[3:05:23.880 --> 3:05:28.800]  accessible articles reticites a drought communication on copyright reform
[3:05:28.800 --> 3:05:33.520]  leaked last week the ideas expressed by the document challenged the existing
[3:05:33.520 --> 3:05:38.160]  interpretation and spirit of the law as well as common sense each web link would
[3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:42.840]  become a legal landmine and would allow press publishers to hold every single
[3:05:42.840 --> 3:05:47.720]  actor on the internet liable she went on to explain Retta believes the EU will
[3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:51.920]  try to slide this through under the guise of clearing up unanswered questions

[3:08:13.880 --> 3:08:17.560]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host in this fourth
[3:08:17.560 --> 3:08:22.280]  hour and we have a big fourth hour coming up in the next segment we're gonna be
[3:08:22.280 --> 3:08:27.360]  joined by documentary filmmaker Mark Hall he's done a film called Killing Ed
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:30.120]  I don't think it's been released yet we'll talk to him about the details of
[3:08:30.120 --> 3:08:34.520]  when and where it's going to be released but the key thing about this is this is
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:37.920]  a documentary about our schools what's going on in the schools a lot of people
[3:08:37.920 --> 3:08:42.240]  don't like what's happening with charter schools I want to see educational
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:47.880]  choice but I'm concerned when I see crony capitalism the problem I see with
[3:08:47.880 --> 3:08:53.240]  charter schools is that the the power the money is still being removed from the
[3:08:53.240 --> 3:08:56.640]  local community at a very high level that invites corruption but also invites
[3:08:56.640 --> 3:09:01.200]  something else in this case which you really need to pay attention to this is
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:05.440]  a story and that really shows the worst case his film shows the worst case of
[3:09:05.440 --> 3:09:10.640]  what can happen with charter schools and I think the Fatala Gulen schools
[3:09:10.640 --> 3:09:17.200]  essentially controlled and run by an exiled Islamic Imam from Turkey he
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:23.080]  proposed a transnational caliphate he called it an Islamic State of being
[3:09:23.080 --> 3:09:27.280]  run out of Turkey he was thrown out of Turkey back in 1999 so that's how long
[3:09:27.280 --> 3:09:33.360]  the Islamic State IS has been around okay but of course he's not creating
[3:09:33.360 --> 3:09:38.880]  moderate rebels inside these countries that are already at war no the real
[3:09:38.880 --> 3:09:43.000]  thing we need to be concerned about is the education of our children and in
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:48.160]  other countries these schools that are run by the Gulen movement are explicitly
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:53.000]  Islamic they're religious schools and there's a lot of questionable things
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:56.480]  about these schools we're going to talk about that when he joins us in the next
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:01.000]  break I want to tell you about what we're going to do tonight with the live
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:04.440]  debate coverage our political science 3000 debate coverage is going to resume
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:08.680]  tonight with our celebrity big brother debate being held I think this one is in
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:12.920]  Wisconsin the key thing is it's going to be Fox News business that's going to be
[3:10:12.920 --> 3:10:17.120]  doing this it's going to be Neil Cavuto and another moderator asking them
[3:10:17.120 --> 3:10:19.640]  questions they say this is going to be different this one is really going to be
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:23.840]  about issues but of course it's going to be about jobs taxes the economy form
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:27.680]  policy the same stuff they always talk about you know will they talk about the
[3:10:27.680 --> 3:10:31.880]  militarized police state will they talk about the surveillance state will they
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:35.920]  talk about the war on our people that they call prohibition actually they do
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:40.120]  call it a war they call it the war on drugs actually it's a war of drugs
[3:10:40.120 --> 3:10:44.840]  against the American people we're going to talk about the candidates responses of
[3:10:44.840 --> 3:10:48.240]  that before we do real quickly I just want to let you know that we have a new
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:52.240]  product you just heard Alex Jones talking to Dr. Group about this living
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:56.080]  defense by info wars statistics are clear nine out of ten people are
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:10:59.680]  infested with harmful organisms these toxic organisms can be transmitted by
[3:10:59.680 --> 3:11:04.240]  people by pets by food the environment so many other sources once they've made
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:07.920]  it into your body they steal your nutrients they release toxic waste so
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:12.760]  this is one way to get rid of toxic parasites it's a new product living
[3:11:12.760 --> 3:11:19.240]  defense you can find it at info wars life calm today they're going to one thing
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:21.720]  that I would like to see them talk about and I don't know if they will talk
[3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:27.240]  about this or not of course that is the candidates positions on drugs I guess
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:30.840]  we could call this the candidates on drugs and say what have they been
[3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:36.280]  smoking I don't know but they are basically they they found a way to make
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:42.280]  themselves approachable to make themselves look like every man and of
[3:11:42.280 --> 3:11:45.780]  course we had Carly Fiorina was the first one to do this back in the first
[3:11:45.780 --> 3:11:50.160]  debate in September she talked about her daughter she says I very much hope
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:52.760]  that I'm the only person on this stage you can say this but I know there are
[3:11:52.760 --> 3:11:55.640]  millions of Americans out there who will say the same thing my husband Frank and
[3:11:55.640 --> 3:12:01.120]  I buried a child to drug addiction now she didn't tell you what kind of drug
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:03.840]  addiction that was because she didn't want to talk about the fact that she
[3:12:03.840 --> 3:12:07.880]  lost her daughter to prescription drugs and alcohol abuse and it was her step
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:12.080]  daughter who was an adult at the time similar thing is going on now with
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:17.560]  Chris Christie and Jeb Bush Jeb Bush if you remember when he was governor his
[3:12:17.560 --> 3:12:22.120]  daughter ran into some problems and he castigated the press for talking about
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:26.640]  that Chris Christie but now he's talking about it now now it's cool you
[3:12:26.640 --> 3:12:32.880]  know he this is the the new Jeb can fix it Bush this is the new Jeb Bush that
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:36.480]  doesn't wear tie doesn't work jacket either you know he just goes out and
[3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:42.120]  talks he's the every man that's the new approach and so now that new Jeb Bush is
[3:12:42.120 --> 3:12:46.120]  going to capitalize on his daughter's problems with drug addiction and you know
[3:12:46.120 --> 3:12:51.460]  what it is a problem here's an article that we had just last week of 46,471
[3:12:51.460 --> 3:12:56.200]  drug overdoses more Americans die from drug overdoses than from car crashes or
[3:12:56.200 --> 3:13:01.840]  guns but guess what the worst drug overdoses are from prescription drugs you
[3:13:01.840 --> 3:13:07.160]  know the same things that cause problems for Carly Fiorina's daughter for Jeb
[3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:12.280]  Bush's daughter prescription drugs are they going to make those illegal I don't
[3:13:12.280 --> 3:13:18.160]  know also we had a report this weekend DEA report says heroin and meth
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:23.840]  seizures are up 300% in Arizona is that a sign that the war on drugs is working I
[3:13:23.840 --> 3:13:29.600]  don't think so I think this is a sign that we have the tip of the iceberg very
[3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:34.320]  similar to what we saw happening in the Antarctic remember we had reports of
[3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:38.920]  Antarctic ice flows melting off and breaking off that increasing
[3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:42.440]  dramatically and everybody said look at that the polar caps are melting and
[3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:48.680]  NASA NASA came out and said no based on our satellite information yes there is
[3:13:48.680 --> 3:13:52.680]  an increase in ice that is breaking up but if you look at other parts of
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:58.840]  Antarctica there are record amounts of ice there's a net increase of ice that's
[3:13:58.840 --> 3:14:04.040]  why you're seeing an increase and it melting in the in one area is because
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:09.080]  it is going up by record amounts it's a similar situation where you see the
[3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:14.720]  heroin the meth showing up in record amounts 300% I think that's an indication
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:21.680]  that the trafficking has gone up we know that's what happened in Afghanistan when
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:27.200]  America went into Afghanistan the Taliban had reduced the growing of heroin
[3:14:27.200 --> 3:14:31.760]  and when we went in there it went from about a 10% of the world's supply up
[3:14:31.760 --> 3:14:35.520]  into the upper 90s now every year they have a record crop since the American
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:39.960]  government has gone into Afghanistan we've got a record crop of poppies that
[3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:45.560]  they use to make heroin and other opiates but the 2016ers as they say in
[3:14:45.560 --> 3:14:49.440]  CNN are now opening up about drug addiction fights because it is now cool
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:52.920]  it is now a way to connect with the people they point out Jeb Bush on the
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:58.880]  campaign trail New Hampshire spoke in emotional terms he says I visited my
[3:14:58.880 --> 3:15:03.160]  daughter in jail I never expected to see my beautiful daughter in jail and
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:07.920]  then he did what I can imagine they should have said right next after that
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:12.400]  is so I got her out you know there's not going to be any mandatory minimums for
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:17.040]  the Bush clan are there that's the insanity of the drug war course that
[3:15:17.040 --> 3:15:22.040]  started with the revered Ronald Reagan these mandatory minimums but in her case
[3:15:22.040 --> 3:15:26.200]  she was arrested in 2002 at the age of 24 for trying to fill a false
[3:15:26.200 --> 3:15:31.240]  prescription she was sentenced to 10 days in jail 10 days 10 days not 10 years
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:36.760]  like your daughter would be sentenced no the Bush daughter gets 10 days in jail
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:41.280]  and it's because of contempt because after they put her in a drug rehab
[3:15:41.280 --> 3:15:46.600]  program they found her with crack cocaine now let me tell you something if
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:52.080]  you were not a drug if you were not a Bush drug-pushing member of that family
[3:15:52.080 --> 3:15:57.040]  you were found with prescription drug abuse you were found with crack cocaine
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:01.480]  you would get a lot more than 10 days but now he wants to connect with everybody
[3:16:01.480 --> 3:16:06.720]  okay he wants to tell everybody that you know he understands that he feels our
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:10.240]  pain I don't really know what his prescription is I know that Chris Christie
[3:16:10.240 --> 3:16:14.360]  had a viral video this Saturday when I looked at it it had over four million
[3:16:14.360 --> 3:16:19.680]  views he was saying okay fine they bumped me off of the debate but I'm gonna get to
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:24.360]  people with videos like this and they had a very slickly produced video ultra
[3:16:24.360 --> 3:16:30.200]  ultra close-up on his face and you know you could see so you could see the
[3:16:30.200 --> 3:16:35.000]  emotion very dramatic effect and he goes to a long story about a friend that he
[3:16:35.000 --> 3:16:39.240]  had from law school and he makes a case about how this guy had everything very
[3:16:39.240 --> 3:16:44.520]  successful in law school very successful as a lawyer he had a beautiful
[3:16:44.520 --> 3:16:49.280]  family a lot of money and all those guys he lost everything because of
[3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:54.480]  prescription drug abuse he hurt his back he went to an MD and the MD put him on
[3:16:54.480 --> 3:17:00.480]  painkillers per cassette and because of the per cassette prescription he got
[3:17:00.480 --> 3:17:05.480]  addicted to that he lost his job he lost his money he lost his family and
[3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:08.640]  eventually he committed suicide and you can see that if you're watching this you
[3:17:08.640 --> 3:17:13.160]  can see how tightly tight and close that is extreme close up on Chris Christie
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:17.240]  because this is about a making a visceral connection with the public
[3:17:17.240 --> 3:17:21.760]  that's what this is really about so Chris Christie tells again like Carly
[3:17:21.760 --> 3:17:25.080]  Fiorina telling about her daughter who was addicted to prescription drugs and
[3:17:25.080 --> 3:17:30.320]  alcohol Chris Christie tells about a friend that he had who died from
[3:17:30.320 --> 3:17:35.600]  prescription drug abuse and then they pivot to marijuana isn't that amazing
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:39.400]  isn't that amazing doesn't that tell you something certainly tells me something
[3:17:39.400 --> 3:17:44.160]  but of course it's interesting that Chris Christie says now he's going to shut
[3:17:44.160 --> 3:17:48.200]  down the 10th amendment for Colorado and Oregon and Washington these states who
[3:17:48.200 --> 3:17:52.600]  have legalized marijuana because they realize that the war on drugs is a
[3:17:52.600 --> 3:17:56.240]  failure Chris Christie will say that it's a failure but then he wants to
[3:17:56.240 --> 3:18:02.040]  continue it his one his only concession is that he wants to imprison the drug
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:06.480]  sailors sellers and not the drug buyers well here's a news flash for Chris
[3:18:06.480 --> 3:18:11.280]  Christie we've been there we've done that we did that with alcohol prohibition
[3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:17.040]  we only went after the Al Capone's see what changed was under Ronald Reagan we
[3:18:17.040 --> 3:18:22.400]  went after the end user that's how abhorrent this thing has become this
[3:18:22.400 --> 3:18:27.240]  44 years of failed policy we went after the end user yeah they only went after
[3:18:27.240 --> 3:18:30.840]  the drug dealers under alcohol prohibition and it was a failure and as
[3:18:30.840 --> 3:18:35.160]  Chris Christie a lawyer should understand we needed a constitutional
[3:18:35.160 --> 3:18:38.920]  amendment for alcohol prohibition where is your constitutional amendment Chris
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:42.920]  Christie to prohibit marijuana or any of the other things that you say you have
[3:18:42.920 --> 3:18:47.560]  the authority to throw us in jail for life about okay what you have done and
[3:18:47.560 --> 3:18:51.920]  what you need to understand is that these people who have foisted this war of
[3:18:51.920 --> 3:18:57.120]  prohibition on us it's not about using drugs because people are going to use
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:00.960]  drugs anyway aren't they aren't they still using drugs after 44 years that has
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:04.800]  been a total failure and he's right it has been a total failure in terms of
[3:19:04.800 --> 3:19:08.760]  trying to stop people from using drugs but it has been an immense success at
[3:19:08.760 --> 3:19:14.000]  creating very powerful monopolistic black markets for drug cartels it's been
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:17.520]  a success at completely destroying the rule of law it's been a success at
[3:19:17.520 --> 3:19:21.560]  creating a militarized police state and he wants to continue with that he wants
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:26.600]  to continue with that now Bernie Sanders says he wants to just for marijuana he
[3:19:26.600 --> 3:19:30.080]  has introduced a bill and fine better late than never where's he been for the
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:34.520]  last 44 years he wants to introduce a bill to basically take marijuana off the
[3:19:34.520 --> 3:19:38.000]  list Hillary Clinton says well let's remove it from the FDA list it's not
[3:19:38.000 --> 3:19:41.960]  the FDA list that's schedule one through four list that was created by the UN
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:45.640]  ten years before Nixon's war on drugs that's what this is really about the
[3:19:45.640 --> 3:19:50.040]  only person who got it right was Donald Trump 25 years ago will he have the guts
[3:19:50.040 --> 3:19:54.200]  to say it again that the only way to stop this this whole thing is a joke we
[3:19:54.200 --> 3:19:57.880]  have to legalize drugs to win the war we have to take away the profit from the
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:02.440]  drugs ours stay with us will be right back lying down stand up and fight back

[3:24:16.120 --> 3:24:20.440]  me now is Mark Hall producer and director of a new documentary film called
[3:24:20.440 --> 3:24:25.560]  killing ed subtitled charter schools corruption and the go in movement in
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:30.080]  America this is something that is is very important as Alex was pointing out
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:34.480]  you need to understand what is going on I support freedom of choice in
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:39.360]  education I support parental involvement in education but we need to very carefully
[3:24:39.360 --> 3:24:42.600]  look at the structures that we're going to use with this certainly I think
[3:24:42.600 --> 3:24:47.280]  charter schools have a possibility of and we've seen this happen of crony
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:50.760]  capitalism there's a lot of money in this pot there's a lot of money we're
[3:24:50.760 --> 3:24:55.160]  gonna talk about how much money the largest organization the largest
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:25:01.760]  network of charter schools gets is actually run by an Islamic Imam exiled
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:05.960]  from Turkey and brought into the United States and he has the largest network of
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:09.800]  schools so Mark when you did this you weren't went for I guess really the
[3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:14.520]  worst-case example of what can go wrong with the charter school yeah absolutely
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:18.920]  David thanks thanks for having me here today that killing it is really showing
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:23.760]  us the worst-case scenario in this lightly regulated charter school system
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:27.720]  that we've set up in our country I started shooting this film a number of
[3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:32.800]  years ago after seeing the ghoulin movement and its schools grow and in
[3:25:32.800 --> 3:25:37.000]  number here in Texas they had the largest number of schools here in Texas
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:43.160]  swiftly about 46 I believe now just added one today you were kind enough to
[3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:47.760]  bring as a press release and get this this is coming from the Austin Police
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:52.120]  Department talking about a new fatala ghoulin school that's being opened up
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:55.760]  here in Austin that's one of the things that really came out in this
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:26:00.800]  documentary was how the ghoulin movement has connected itself with law
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:05.280]  enforcement with congressmen with local and state government with contractors
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:08.560]  and all these different but they really are totally connected and of course there
[3:26:08.560 --> 3:26:15.160]  were their pictures in your documentary of Art Acevedo also got congressman
[3:26:15.160 --> 3:26:19.360]  McCall who is head of Homeland Security you would think he would know a
[3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:22.880]  little bit better you would think that he would that this maybe he does yeah
[3:26:22.880 --> 3:26:28.320]  because we've seen what's going on with ISIS in Syria in the Middle East we've
[3:26:28.320 --> 3:26:32.600]  seen that when our government creates a terrorist arms a terrorist trains a
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:36.680]  terrorist gives them money they're moderate terrorists we got that picture
[3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:39.920]  up on our website today as a matter of fact they have a terrorist and has a
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:45.160]  guy in a balaclava holding an AK-47 and then next to him the exact same picture
[3:26:45.160 --> 3:26:48.320]  but it says moderate terrorist because in his left hand he's holding a small
[3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:52.360]  American flag and so we have talked about how our government has been
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:58.280]  involved with the creation of ISIS with the creation of these jihadis using
[3:26:58.280 --> 3:27:02.080]  them as surrogates and wars but this is something that we all should be very
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:07.040]  much aware of very concerned about that this Islamic cleric who floated the
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:11.040]  idea of the Islamic State of a transnational caliphate way back in
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:14.800]  the 90s and was thrown out of Turkey because of that is brought into the
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:18.760]  United States by the CIA they give him letters of recommendation ran
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:23.880]  corporation former bigwig there given gave him letters of recommendation so
[3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:28.640]  he was brought into the United States ushered in by the CIA even though many
[3:27:28.640 --> 3:27:32.600]  people opposed him who knew what he was about and now he's running the biggest
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:35.960]  network of charter schools in the United States getting federal taxpayer money
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:41.720]  yeah exactly I mean we know that Fatula Gul came to United States in 1999 he
[3:27:41.720 --> 3:27:45.560]  had been indicted by the Turkish government at that time for trying to
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:50.360]  overthrow the Turkish secular government he was trying to install a
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:55.440]  theocratic government and he came to the United States ostensibly on a medical
[3:27:55.440 --> 3:28:01.560]  reason for diabetes I understand and he set himself up in the Poconos of
[3:28:01.560 --> 3:28:05.960]  northeastern Pennsylvania where he lives with several hundred of his followers
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:11.840]  and he's operating this global Islamic movement from that location now he
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:16.080]  gets the accent in the documentary you actually go to the gates of his compound
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:20.800]  exactly very gutsy move right we've been there a couple of times and they're not
[3:28:20.800 --> 3:28:24.600]  happy to see us they don't really want to live out in the open it's a very
[3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:29.040]  secretive group we know that their schools here in the United States are
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:34.680]  bringing in followers that follow him from Turkey you know that believe in
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:38.440]  the Gulen movements agenda and they're teaching at these schools not only here
[3:28:38.440 --> 3:28:42.480]  in Texas but all over the United States there's a lot of instructors who come
[3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:46.560]  in from Turkey absolutely and they always do this under the beard just like
[3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:49.440]  they're doing this the school that opens day and as I remarked to you when we were
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:53.000]  waiting you know during the commercial break so this is a strange time of the
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:56.880]  year to open up a new school you know in the middle of November but they're
[3:28:56.880 --> 3:28:59.840]  opening up a new school the Austin Police Department is going to be there
[3:28:59.840 --> 3:29:04.360]  cutting the ribbon with them for this opening ceremony and they call them the
[3:29:04.360 --> 3:29:09.640]  Harmony Public Schools STEM based curriculum and that's science technology
[3:29:09.640 --> 3:29:13.080]  engineering and math but they always talk about the Harmony schools of science
[3:29:13.080 --> 3:29:17.440]  and math yes that's the beard well that is one of the things that they're using I
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:21.840]  think to get our support to get our politicians support is that we're
[3:29:21.840 --> 3:29:26.040]  somehow needing more STEM you know teachers and we need more STEM
[3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:30.040]  educated students that's really just a ruse yeah yeah people are very much
[3:29:30.040 --> 3:29:33.560]  interested in having a science and technology education for their
[3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:36.360]  children rightfully so but the question we're going to address when we come back
[3:29:36.360 --> 3:29:41.960]  is are they getting that or are they getting a propaganda education towards
[3:29:41.960 --> 3:29:46.880]  Turkey towards Islam stay with us we'll be right back with Mark Hall
[3:29:46.880 --> 3:29:53.920]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[3:33:14.080 --> 3:33:19.120]  joining me now is mark hall and he's done a film called killing and he's a
[3:33:19.120 --> 3:33:23.360]  documentary filmmaker he's producer director of this film and I was able to
[3:33:23.360 --> 3:33:28.280]  see an advanced copy of this thank you for inviting me absolutely you invited
[3:33:28.280 --> 3:33:32.720]  me because I talked about the teleglom and this is something people need to be
[3:33:32.720 --> 3:33:35.880]  aware of there are many things that I learned from the film about the gulen
[3:33:35.880 --> 3:33:39.440]  movement and the schools that they've created here in the United States it is
[3:33:39.440 --> 3:33:42.960]  the largest charter school movement in the United States actually largest in
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:46.240]  the world they've got 180 countries that they're in many people estimated at
[3:33:46.240 --> 3:33:49.520]  over a thousand schools worldwide we just had another one open up here in
[3:33:49.520 --> 3:33:54.480]  Austin and the Austin Police Department said that I press release that
[3:33:54.480 --> 3:33:58.320]  mark sent me today talking about how they have a new school opening here in
[3:33:58.320 --> 3:34:05.960]  Austin with 540 students this is the way they they expand and of course we're
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:10.400]  seeing this all over the place that a couple of years ago the Atlantic was
[3:34:10.400 --> 3:34:14.080]  talking about just in Texas they were getting a hundred million dollars a
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:18.400]  year right this has to be a huge amount of money that is being a channel to them
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:22.840]  your documentary talks about what's going on the educational establishment the
[3:34:22.840 --> 3:34:27.200]  impact of charter schools the possibility for corruption for crony
[3:34:27.200 --> 3:34:31.080]  capitalism with the charter school mechanism because there is a huge pot
[3:34:31.080 --> 3:34:35.520]  of money that is in the federal coffers is being handed out to anybody that can
[3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:40.320]  meet these qualifications to start a charter school so that is a problem
[3:34:40.320 --> 3:34:45.400]  problem right there okay that we need to look at but you look at the very worst
[3:34:45.400 --> 3:34:50.520]  case the Glenn movement yeah go ahead I was just gonna say I mean you know the
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:54.480]  new school that's open today is one of six here in Austin you know they're
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:59.120]  educating roughly a little over 60,000 students across the United States now
[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:03.240]  wow and they're bringing in you know many thousands of teachers who are
[3:35:03.240 --> 3:35:08.200]  followers of Imam Ghul and on H1B visas to teach at the schools we talked a
[3:35:08.200 --> 3:35:11.960]  little bit about STEM education a lot of the politicians that you see in the
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:16.240]  film are saying you know we need to have more teachers that are qualified to
[3:35:16.240 --> 3:35:20.760]  teach these STEM subjects science engineering these technology subjects
[3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:25.640]  but really it's a ruse it's really a falsehood to bring in these followers
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:30.240]  from Turkey who are you know they have sworn their allegiance to Imam
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:34.520]  Fatula Ghul and it is a religious movement it is a transnational caliphate
[3:35:34.520 --> 3:35:37.600]  that he's trying to set up he talked about an Islamic state and got thrown out
[3:35:37.600 --> 3:35:41.960]  of Turkey in the 1990s brought in to the United States then by the CIA to set
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:45.520]  this up that's everyone he's concerned is that what he is setting up here is not
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:49.760]  a bunch of schools of science and math but what he's setting up here is Islamic
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:54.280]  madrasas like he has set up in his explicitly done in Islamic countries
[3:35:54.280 --> 3:35:59.320]  some of his detractors have called his educational institutions educational
[3:35:59.320 --> 3:36:03.200]  jihad because what you see in the schools here in the United States and
[3:36:03.200 --> 3:36:08.320]  elsewhere is intense national Turkification of their children so
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:13.320]  instead of teaching Spanish as a language in many of the schools here on
[3:36:13.320 --> 3:36:18.480]  the border of Mexico you're seeing these schools primarily teach Turkish to these
[3:36:18.480 --> 3:36:23.280]  young children yes and and these are not Turkish kids these are kids that come
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:28.520]  from a variety of backgrounds Hispanics you know Caucasians African Americans
[3:36:28.520 --> 3:36:33.480]  and you know the question is why are they being so intensively taught a love
[3:36:33.480 --> 3:36:37.880]  of Turkey when they should be taught something about our own country they
[3:36:37.880 --> 3:36:41.160]  bring them in with the beard of science and technology because that's what
[3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:44.520]  parents see as a future for their children getting a degree in engineering
[3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:47.680]  or something like that they can get a nice paying job with that and yet when
[3:36:47.680 --> 3:36:51.920]  they come into these schools as you show in your movie killing Ed they come in
[3:36:51.920 --> 3:36:56.080]  and they're getting giving them a lot of Turkish culture teaching them the
[3:36:56.080 --> 3:37:01.840]  Turkish language sending them on trips to Turkey exactly every year thousands of
[3:37:01.840 --> 3:37:05.960]  these children are going to Turkey for the summer I've talked to parents that
[3:37:05.960 --> 3:37:10.280]  have gone on these trips we don't cover it very much in the film but you do see
[3:37:10.280 --> 3:37:14.720]  you know students from even public schools that somehow have been invited
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:19.360]  to go on these trips to Turkey as a result of the Gulen movement I think
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:22.720]  it's Disneyland experience when they go well they get it they can't experience
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:26.280]  it's not really the real Turkey and I think this is what irks the secular Turks
[3:37:26.280 --> 3:37:30.720]  that we should be supporting in Turkey we should not be supporting a global
[3:37:30.720 --> 3:37:34.760]  Islamic movement here in our country because they're getting an excess of
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:40.120]  $500 million a year in taxpayer funds that's amazing these are funds that you
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:45.080]  and I are giving to our government and they're going directly to this
[3:37:45.080 --> 3:37:50.360]  organization now a lot of that money is going to the schools to operate the
[3:37:50.360 --> 3:37:54.480]  schools to pay salaries however you'll find that young teachers that are
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:58.080]  coming to work at these schools that are not affiliated with the Gulen movement
[3:37:58.080 --> 3:38:02.360]  are being paid a lot less than the Turkish teachers that are coming over
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:08.920]  now a part of that money evidently and apparently is being skimmed every year
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:14.680]  to go to the non-educational purposes that Fatullah Gulen has for his followers
[3:38:14.680 --> 3:38:19.640]  including what I consider a very soft civil war that's occurring right now in
[3:38:19.640 --> 3:38:24.520]  Turkey we're supporting that happening all the time there's news of Gulen
[3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:29.640]  followers being arrested by the Erdogan government and so there are people that
[3:38:29.640 --> 3:38:33.600]  are high in the Turkish government that are trying to arrest and
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:37.560]  then release people who are Gulen followers and then you know there's a
[3:38:37.560 --> 3:38:40.720]  back-and-forth they're they're arrested release arrested release and you point
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:43.960]  out it's an ongoing I said looks like they're on the cusp of the civil war you
[3:38:43.960 --> 3:38:47.640]  said it's kind of a soft civil war right now absolutely the Gulen movement has
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:53.600]  taken over the judiciary in Turkey elements of the police including secret
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:38:57.600]  police they tried to take over the version of the Turkish version of the
[3:38:57.600 --> 3:39:02.760]  CIA they were unsuccessful Erdogan and Gulen were friends they're both Islamists
[3:39:02.760 --> 3:39:08.080]  Erdogan runs the AKP party he's just been reelected on November 1st with a
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:11.960]  majority he'd love to change the Constitution of Turkey but the Gulen
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:17.720]  movement has been countering those efforts for many years now so we're
[3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:22.360]  supporting the wrong people with our tax dollars ultimately our money our money
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:28.600]  tax dollars is going to this very anti-democratic group in Turkey it's
[3:39:28.600 --> 3:39:32.080]  going to a group of people here in the United States that are teaching over
[3:39:32.080 --> 3:39:38.040]  60,000 students now and we don't seem to have the political will or the will in
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:41.320]  our law enforcement to do something about it there's this is something we've
[3:39:41.320 --> 3:39:46.600]  seen for decades all my life we've seen the malinvestment in terms of foreign
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:50.440]  policy propping up dictatorships and so forth abroad and and seeing how that is
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:55.120]  making those countries worse and yet now with the charter school movement using
[3:39:55.120 --> 3:40:00.160]  the Gulen movement using the charter school structure we're doing the same
[3:40:00.160 --> 3:40:05.160]  thing to our country exactly and it's worth noting that many of our political
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:09.800]  leadership have been on trips to Turkey as well yes and we could only cover
[3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:14.920]  several hundred that have gone we think there's more than that but you'll see in
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:18.280]  the film dozens and dozens of people you mentioned Mike McCall
[3:40:18.280 --> 3:40:25.760]  Sheila Jackson Lee senators the Washington Post is currently you know
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:28.200]  there's been an investigation a congressional investigation in the
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:33.760]  ethics of this and so there's a real problem here the film discusses that
[3:40:33.760 --> 3:40:38.240]  and of course the Gulen movement has made hundreds and hundreds of millions
[3:40:38.240 --> 3:40:44.560]  of dollars off of us to advance their goals which are not you know that they're
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:48.200]  not democratic democratic goals yes absolutely and I want to before we run
[3:40:48.200 --> 3:40:52.480]  at a time I want to play a trailer for your movie killing Ed I should have done
[3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:55.480]  that a little bit earlier give people a taste of what this is about we're gonna
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:40:58.800]  play this trailer when we get to the points where that you have Turkish
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:41:02.240]  speakers on there that are subtitled for the trailer I'll narrate that let's run
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:09.120]  that trailer right now a charter school is a public school there is some state
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:13.720]  regulation that don't apply to charge so we can change much more rapidly than in
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:17.960]  traditional school districts they're privately managed schools that are
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:22.160]  funded with taxpayer dollars it's a perfect storm that's destroying
[3:41:22.160 --> 3:41:27.840]  American public education this is about money this is about politics and it's
[3:41:27.840 --> 3:41:31.440]  harmful to our democracy I would say about 300 kids are supposed to use this
[3:41:31.440 --> 3:41:36.400]  playground there seem to be some treatment differently of minority
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:44.160]  students minority teachers and females it's not a good environment for anybody
[3:41:44.160 --> 3:41:48.440]  I've never known a school to be rated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation this
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:51.520]  is a first there's a lot of perception that KIPP is the largest
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:57.840]  charter school operator in the United States yeah it's not most Americans are
[3:41:57.840 --> 3:42:03.120]  not aware that the largest charter chain in America is run by a group of
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:07.200]  Turkish men associated with an imam who happens to be very politically
[3:42:07.200 --> 3:42:11.760]  powerful in Turkey we started writing about how the fatala
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:16.280]  movement organized in Turkey they accused us journalists of being part of a
[3:42:16.280 --> 3:42:24.120]  terrorist organization we were detained then arrested because the fatala
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:39.480]  Gulen turkey is less democratic America isn't aware of this the Gulen
[3:42:39.480 --> 3:42:46.040]  movement is so sly by the time you realize this it will be too late let's
[3:42:46.040 --> 3:42:57.680]  not lose sight of the fact that what this whole process needs to be about is the
[3:42:57.680 --> 3:43:02.240]  well mark with the help of your your documentary hopefully people realize
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:07.360]  what is going on before it is too late there's an excellent website you said
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:09.800]  you're familiar with this of course because you know a lot of research on
[3:43:09.800 --> 3:43:14.920]  this a guide to the Gulen's movements movements activities in the US look this
[3:43:14.920 --> 3:43:18.400]  up because this is for Gulen charter school parents and teachers and for
[3:43:18.400 --> 3:43:22.800]  concerned community members this is a great website do you know the address
[3:43:22.800 --> 3:43:28.360]  of this website I don't have you know it's it's C.A.S.I. L.I.P.S. is the
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:34.200]  organization Kasi lips okay and I believe it is Gulen charter schools dot
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:40.040]  weebly dot com I may be in incorrect but this is an excellent resource we're
[3:43:40.040 --> 3:43:43.680]  just Google a guide to the Gulen movements activities in the US you'll
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:47.080]  probably find it from that title right there and I'll be real quick quote here
[3:43:47.080 --> 3:43:50.600]  the Gulen movement is secretive its activities of methods are complicated
[3:43:50.600 --> 3:43:54.480]  internationally obscure in a constant state of flux difficult to grasp however
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:58.160]  the essence of the movement can be summed up in a single sentence written by
[3:43:58.160 --> 3:44:03.240]  researcher his last name is Ozzie Peck in his 2009 thesis he attended Gulen
[3:44:03.240 --> 3:44:06.600]  schools and Turkey has extensive direct contact with the movement and he says the
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:11.160]  primary objective of the Gulen movement is to increase its share of power and
[3:44:11.160 --> 3:44:17.160]  of course that power is organized around an Islamic state absolutely it's very
[3:44:17.160 --> 3:44:20.800]  troubling that our law enforcement as you see in the film FBI raids in four
[3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:24.880]  states it's gone on for six years there have been no deportations there's been
[3:44:24.880 --> 3:44:29.160]  no arrests we cover the bribery of a state official or attempted bribery of
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:33.200]  a state official in Louisiana keep one of their schools open but fortunately
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:36.720]  Louisiana did the right thing they investigated it we go through that
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:41.640]  report with people that were you know involved yes very powerful it's there's
[3:44:41.640 --> 3:44:46.560]  just so much going on it's a complex story here you're talking about the
[3:44:46.560 --> 3:44:50.920]  FBI is investigating this and yet we see that the CIA brought him in we have
[3:44:50.920 --> 3:44:53.960]  the same kind of thing going on here in America that's going on in Turkey you
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:58.480]  got a divided government some factions will enable him some factions will
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:02.640]  oppose him the same thing is happening here in America we have members of the
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:06.320]  American government that enable Gulen that brought him in talk about that talk
[3:45:06.320 --> 3:45:09.960]  about the CIA we alluded to that earlier how they got him into the country we
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:12.760]  don't spend much time about this connection in the film because it's
[3:45:12.760 --> 3:45:18.320]  very difficult to to prove anything with the CIA is very dark and mysterious
[3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:22.680]  however I will say that the connections with the Gulen movement seem to be well
[3:45:22.680 --> 3:45:27.480]  established by those that live in Turkey they understand that Gulen schools in
[3:45:27.480 --> 3:45:31.600]  Central Asia some of the thousand plus schools that they operate around the
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:37.360]  world were places that many CIA agents were working right after the fall of the
[3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:42.880]  USSR and so there's been a connection with high-level government members in
[3:45:42.880 --> 3:45:48.320]  our own government with CIA when I was doing research for this film I talked
[3:45:48.320 --> 3:45:53.720]  to prosecutors that opposed the extension of Fetula Gulen's visa status here
[3:45:53.720 --> 3:45:58.880]  in the United States some years ago it led to a lawsuit in 2008 who were the
[3:45:58.880 --> 3:46:04.480]  people that swore out affidavits that said that Gulen was a man of you know
[3:46:04.480 --> 3:46:08.720]  impeccable background in a true educational leader from around the
[3:46:08.720 --> 3:46:13.640]  world it was members of the CIA it was a member of the Turkish a former US
[3:46:13.640 --> 3:46:18.280]  ambassador to Turkey one of those members was Graham Fuller who you may
[3:46:18.280 --> 3:46:23.040]  know of he's been very active in promoting political Islam around the
[3:46:23.040 --> 3:46:27.480]  world so there's a lot of connections here that need to be looked at further
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:31.880]  yes yes very very troubling you know we were talking about how they use science
[3:46:31.880 --> 3:46:37.240]  and technology for beard and you have a very very good exposé of that in your
[3:46:37.240 --> 3:46:41.360]  film showing how they use science fairs talk about that explain that to the
[3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:44.440]  audience well one of the things that the Gulen movement has done in the United
[3:46:44.440 --> 3:46:49.560]  States and other countries around the world is set up science fairs now the
[3:46:49.560 --> 3:46:52.840]  science fairs are very interesting they're they're a way to stair step
[3:46:52.840 --> 3:46:58.560]  their their their profile here in the United States about three quarters of
[3:46:58.560 --> 3:47:02.480]  the students that go there are from Gulen charter schools and from schools
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:07.480]  from around the world so we actually went to one of those Gulen science fairs
[3:47:07.480 --> 3:47:12.360]  called I sweep in Houston and talked to some of the children who I don't think
[3:47:12.360 --> 3:47:15.320]  we're really well well aware of what they were presenting to the people at
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:18.960]  the fair and it's come out in documents especially in the Louisiana
[3:47:18.960 --> 3:47:23.840]  investigation that teachers Turkish teachers the administrators that are
[3:47:23.840 --> 3:47:27.720]  trying to make a lot of money through these charter schools we're actually
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:32.280]  creating those projects for the kids just to stand in front of and and to look
[3:47:32.280 --> 3:47:36.200]  good of course almost everybody you know it seems wins and award it's
[3:47:36.200 --> 3:47:39.520]  something that they can brag about they can take back to their charter schools
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:43.000]  and say you know our kids are really doing well at these these science fairs
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:47.880]  but it's it's a falsehood again using science as a beard for what the real
[3:47:47.880 --> 3:47:51.560]  objective is so the teachers create the science project have the kids stand there
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:54.920]  in front of it and not just that not just students within that particular
[3:47:54.920 --> 3:47:58.280]  school district or even within that state as you pointed out they're
[3:47:58.280 --> 3:48:01.520]  bringing in students from all over the world as you showed in your documentary
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:06.520]  film to make it look very large to show impressive projects that were done by
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:10.160]  adults for them to bring in students from all over the world for these science
[3:48:10.160 --> 3:48:14.640]  fairs and then they bring in local and state officials to see this and they
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:18.080]  just kind of walk by these different projects is like oh that's great there's
[3:48:18.080 --> 3:48:22.280]  a kid and look at what he did yeah exactly I mean this is I want to be very
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:25.880]  clear that I do not believe that the gulen movement or members of the movement
[3:48:25.880 --> 3:48:30.440]  are are violent they're not what we see on televisions from Syria they're much
[3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:35.040]  more sophisticated in how they're trying to achieve what is a similar goal
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:39.160]  which in my opinion is the re-establishment of an Ottoman Empire
[3:48:39.160 --> 3:48:44.560]  let's say an Ottoman Empire and Turkey gulen is very much a neo-automaniast I
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:49.200]  think his followers are that way too they're followers of Said Nursi who
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:52.920]  believed in science so they do have the science in their background they're not
[3:48:52.920 --> 3:48:57.280]  they're not science at they're not against science at all so this is one
[3:48:57.280 --> 3:49:01.200]  thing that you do see in their schools and I think it's also very attractive to
[3:49:01.200 --> 3:49:06.560]  parents well you show in your in your documentary some of the Turkish
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:09.760]  instructors that they bring in and they're not they don't have any
[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:15.280]  educational background per se they they mix them in with domestic teachers who
[3:49:15.280 --> 3:49:19.040]  come in and they have many of them have turned into whistleblowers but that's
[3:49:19.040 --> 3:49:23.160]  the amazing thing about they bring them in because of their loyalty to the gulen
[3:49:23.160 --> 3:49:27.880]  movement and then pay them an inflated salary but then demand that they tie it
[3:49:27.880 --> 3:49:34.320]  back 20% of it exactly it the tithing is between 10 and 30% it's also dependent
[3:49:34.320 --> 3:49:38.720]  on the regions of the country as you see in the film the gulen movement some
[3:49:38.720 --> 3:49:42.640]  years ago about five or seven years ago divided the United States into five
[3:49:42.640 --> 3:49:46.640]  regions and they send the teachers into these five regions and of course they're
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:50.200]  making more money let's say in New York City than they would here in Austin
[3:49:50.200 --> 3:49:55.200]  Texas but yes there is a bag man that comes along for every pay period and
[3:49:55.200 --> 3:49:59.640]  he's taking a percentage of their paychecks these h1b teachers from Turkey
[3:49:59.640 --> 3:50:04.880]  that are followers of gulen that money is being brought back to Pennsylvania and
[3:50:04.880 --> 3:50:11.200]  it's being used for their purposes and non-educational purposes you know it is
[3:50:11.200 --> 3:50:15.880]  very troubling to look at this and like I said I I support parental involvement I
[3:50:15.880 --> 3:50:20.600]  support parental choice I know Charlotte Israbe has been very negative for quite
[3:50:20.600 --> 3:50:24.400]  a while about charter schools and I really had not looked into what she had to
[3:50:24.400 --> 3:50:28.240]  say about charter schools certainly if you've got a pot of money that somebody
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:31.360]  can put together some kind of a business structure present a plan to
[3:50:31.360 --> 3:50:35.640]  someone without a lot of supervision that just invites corruption and crony
[3:50:35.640 --> 3:50:39.120]  capitalism so we're going to talk about that when we come back briefly this
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:41.960]  whole structure and the issues with charter schools when we come back I'm
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:47.440]  talking to Mark Hall the producer and director of Killing Ed charter schools
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:59.760]  corruption and the gulen movement in America will be right back my name is

[3:54:22.480 --> 3:54:26.840]  schools and what can go wrong. A worst-case example of it is the Ghoulin
[3:54:26.840 --> 3:54:31.120]  movement getting hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money to set up
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:35.200]  Islamic focused schools and we're gonna go back and talk to Mark about that real

[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:42.200]  get information on it because this is a very important film to see I saw the an
[3:54:42.200 --> 3:54:47.240]  advanced screening of it and that's one of the reasons that we've got Mark here
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:50.200]  before we get back to that I just want to let you know real quickly that today

[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:16.360]  short segment here I want to come back we saw some of things in the trailer that
[3:55:16.360 --> 3:55:21.600]  we saw Bill Gates tell us what Bill Gates is involvement is with this Islamic
[3:55:21.600 --> 3:55:26.160]  Imam who wants to set up a multinational caliphate well the Gates
[3:55:26.160 --> 3:55:30.060]  Foundation the Gates found family foundation is given hundreds of
[3:55:30.060 --> 3:55:33.360]  millions of dollars to advance the charter school movement in the United
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:37.480]  States we know that some of that movement has gone to the schools operated
[3:55:37.480 --> 3:55:41.000]  by the Gulen Gulen movement here in the United States there's other family
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:47.560]  foundations as well Eli Broad the Dell family foundation here in Austin numerous
[3:55:47.560 --> 3:55:52.040]  the Walmart family foundation too has given quite a bit of money and these
[3:55:52.040 --> 3:55:57.080]  people are not they're not interested really in what's best for the public
[3:55:57.080 --> 3:56:01.440]  or our children yes they're they're interested in advancing something you
[3:56:01.440 --> 3:56:05.280]  know beyond us they're they're unaccountable we tried to talk to the
[3:56:05.280 --> 3:56:09.040]  person that's in charge of the charter school grants they're at the Gates
[3:56:09.040 --> 3:56:13.480]  Foundation in Seattle there they don't want to talk to anyone they're totally
[3:56:13.480 --> 3:56:18.440]  beyond that I want to also mention something too I don't want it to to be
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:24.000]  thought that these schools are vote or overtly teaching Islam there's no
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:27.520]  indication to me that I can find that they're teaching Islam however in the
[3:56:27.520 --> 3:56:30.640]  United States in the United States they are operating schools that teach
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:35.080]  religion in Germany that are publicly funded we think there's schools that
[3:56:35.080 --> 3:56:39.720]  are doing similar things in Australia of course if they do that and there
[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:42.440]  there's allegations that they are doing that they would have to do that
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:45.480]  covertly or they would lose the hundreds of millions of dollars that they get in
[3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:49.000]  public absolutely and and one of the things too I think is worth mentioning
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:52.960]  is through the cultural education that children are getting about Turkey and
[3:56:52.960 --> 3:56:57.000]  going to Turkish to Turkey and visiting Turkish schools there that are
[3:56:57.000 --> 3:57:02.720]  religious in purpose you know they are being acclimated to understand Islam
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:07.600]  from a very particular view yeah we have Muslims in the film who have been
[3:57:07.600 --> 3:57:11.720]  arrested who have been put in jail who have been tortured by the gulen
[3:57:11.720 --> 3:57:15.200]  movement outside of the United States and this is not the Islam that they know
[3:57:15.200 --> 3:57:19.880]  so it's important to try to understand you know the complexities of this oh
[3:57:19.880 --> 3:57:23.080]  yeah there's a lot of different flavors of Islam if you want to go back and
[3:57:23.080 --> 3:57:25.960]  look at Christian denominations especially around the time of the
[3:57:25.960 --> 3:57:29.040]  Reformation the competition back and forth between Catholic and Protestant
[3:57:29.040 --> 3:57:33.160]  and other non-ominations we see that happening with the war in Syria I mean
[3:57:33.160 --> 3:57:37.280]  you've got the Sunnis the Shias the Wahhabists I mean they're at each other's
[3:57:37.280 --> 3:57:42.200]  throat very much so so we see that happening but you know I guess as we're
[3:57:42.200 --> 3:57:46.320]  talking mark one of the things that concerns me about all of this is the
[3:57:46.320 --> 3:57:50.600]  fact that parents are just not involved enough in their children's education you
[3:57:50.600 --> 3:57:53.680]  have to be involved you have to understand there are people out there who
[3:57:53.680 --> 3:57:57.640]  want to socially engineer society who want to control your children and use
[3:57:57.640 --> 3:58:01.640]  them as pawns that goes all the way back to Plato's Republic and that's the same
[3:58:01.640 --> 3:58:05.000]  thing that we're seeing now we have to guard against the only way to guard
[3:58:05.000 --> 3:58:09.120]  against that is to educate yourself we're out of time join us tonight thank
