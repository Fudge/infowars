[08:09.080 --> 08:29.240]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:29.240 --> 08:37.880]  obviously we need to talk about acorn the video that surfaced in the middle of
[08:37.880 --> 08:46.760]  last week showing a young lady dressed up like a hooker with her supposed
[08:46.760 --> 08:53.400]  pimp that's what real journalism is and that's something that citizens can all
[08:53.400 --> 08:59.720]  do especially in the age of YouTube in the age of internet video that's what I
[08:59.720 --> 09:07.080]  started doing in the mid-1990s with access television self-taught and I
[09:07.080 --> 09:19.720]  would go out and cover stories in Austin Texas and really cover government
[09:19.720 --> 09:22.680]  corruption and then it would end up in the newspaper would end up being
[09:22.680 --> 09:29.240]  discussed at city council mainly I would show how the city would put $2,000 a
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.640]  day fines on the elderly people's houses for peeling paint or three inch grass
[09:33.640 --> 09:37.560]  and then they would steal the home through government auction and
[09:37.560 --> 09:42.800]  basically fence it through and sell it to friends of the city council or the
[09:42.800 --> 09:48.200]  county commissioners or I would cover stories about how the public schools
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.200]  were headhunting for blonde-haired blue-eyed children we've since had
[09:52.200 --> 09:56.680]  senators and congressmen on covering the fact that there are bounties on your
[09:56.680 --> 10:00.760]  children and they even put out alerts for certain types of children that
[10:00.760 --> 10:04.840]  adoption agencies are looking for a rich family may want you know a three-year-old
[10:04.840 --> 10:09.240]  brunette girl with blue eyes or green eyes and the order goes out the pedophile
[10:09.240 --> 10:14.680]  operators then fan out I know that's hard for people to believe but that's a
[10:14.680 --> 10:19.520]  government that's who's in government that's who runs government and it
[10:19.520 --> 10:28.800]  didn't matter what a corn office the researchers the investigators went into
[10:28.800 --> 10:33.000]  with their cheap hidden camera they'd walk in and say we got 12-year-old girls
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.560]  we're bringing in to run hooker operations they're illegal aliens it's
[10:36.560 --> 10:40.640]  totally criminal I don't want to pay any taxes and they'd say well we can handle
[10:40.640 --> 11:07.600]  that for you we've got a we've got a system for you right now and that's
[11:07.600 --> 11:14.040]  what runs America that is what America is overweight potbellied diseased people
[11:14.040 --> 11:18.620]  who eat nothing but msg and drink nothing but corn syrup all day who take
[11:18.620 --> 11:23.680]  mercury filled shots dirty hair sticking out the zits all over their faces
[11:23.680 --> 11:26.440]  doesn't matter if they're black doesn't matter of their white doesn't matter of
[11:26.440 --> 11:33.720]  their Hispanic just all they want is money and in overall though a this whole
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.200]  acorn report is a distraction and a diversion I mean I welcome it because I
[11:38.200 --> 11:43.320]  want to stop the big city pimp machine the big city poverty pimp machine that
[11:43.320 --> 11:50.640]  is the shot the Chicago slash New York machine that is taking over all the
[11:50.640 --> 11:55.680]  major cities in the country and I want to stop acorn I want to stop secure core
[11:55.680 --> 12:02.520]  and city year and all these systems where private tax-free foundations get
[12:02.520 --> 12:09.640]  billions of dollars a year of taxpayer money and then these big government
[12:09.640 --> 12:13.720]  types on the right and the left but mainly the left they wrote the book on
[12:13.720 --> 12:20.000]  it go in and get filthy rich and wealthy off of it all these so-called you know
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.160]  for a land therapist all these humanitarians like the Bill and Melinda
[12:24.160 --> 12:28.080]  Gates Foundation they're one of the biggest players in Chicago and housing
[12:28.080 --> 12:36.200]  and homeless in anti-drug programs and sterilization vaccination Bill and
[12:36.200 --> 12:39.680]  Melinda Gates Foundation goes out and gets thousands and thousands of big
[12:39.680 --> 12:48.520]  government grants per major city every year and it makes money you understand
[12:48.520 --> 12:53.240]  that the Annenberg Foundation the Ford Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.520]  this is a big sick joke they started a hundred plus years ago all the phony
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.760]  environmental foundations and bragged it was about owning property tax-free and
[13:01.760 --> 13:13.840]  taking people's property this is the mafia period and they have found that if
[13:13.840 --> 13:28.520]  they come after you they have found that if they come after you under the guise
[13:28.520 --> 13:32.720]  of the government or in the guise of a uniform you'll resist it and demand a
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.600]  process in your rights but if they come as an environmental group or they come as
[13:36.600 --> 13:44.240]  a city group they come as some type of diversity organization they come in the
[13:44.240 --> 13:54.720]  name of the community that they can basically get away with murder if they
[13:54.720 --> 14:06.960]  want to and they do they do in a big way but I would challenge Fox News and
[14:06.960 --> 14:13.520]  Glenn Beck and all of these different establishment organizations while you're
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.040]  worried about the 12 year old Latin American girls that Acorn was ready to
[14:18.040 --> 14:25.200]  help run tax shelters for to run underage slave brothels why don't you talk
[14:25.200 --> 14:29.240]  about Dinecore and Halliburton running giant real child kidnapping rings out
[14:29.240 --> 14:33.440]  of Europe and the United States and being caught doing it in congressional
[14:33.440 --> 14:38.040]  hearings and not getting in trouble I mean if you really care about kids and
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.960]  you're up on your high horse if you're really concerned about government
[14:42.960 --> 14:53.480]  corruption if you're really concerned about tax-free foundation corruption why
[14:53.480 --> 15:00.920]  don't you talk about the bipartisan heist of 23.7 trillion and counting the
[15:00.920 --> 15:07.520]  20 3.7 trillion it's probably more than 28 trillion now that number we're going
[15:07.520 --> 15:13.320]  over is a couple months old why don't you worry about that I mean you're worried
[15:13.320 --> 15:19.240]  about billions of dollars going to Acorn but see Acorn is a convenient low
[15:19.240 --> 15:27.400]  level kind of upstart Illinois slash Louisiana old school big city corruption
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.920]  group trying to go national trying to go international and so you've got the
[15:31.920 --> 15:38.280]  bigger pimps basically slapping them down but also giving conservative mainline
[15:38.280 --> 15:46.240]  America a bone oh look we've got this big city corrupt machine situation and
[15:46.240 --> 15:52.400]  look these women are bragging that yeah they used to be hooker madams too and
[15:52.400 --> 16:00.360]  they had their husbands killed and yeah they're gangster too because they are
[16:00.360 --> 16:05.280]  but let me tell you who the real social workers are we tell you the real acorn is
[16:05.280 --> 16:11.480]  do you know where they recruit most the CPS workers now most of the CPS workers
[16:11.480 --> 16:17.240]  they're recruiting are formerly people on welfare who were on section 8 housing
[16:17.240 --> 16:22.640]  who grew up under the social workers thumb might have even had their brother
[16:22.640 --> 16:28.560]  and sister taken rationalized it believe it's a good thing and then now they're
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.960]  coming after your middle-class kids see when you hear them invoke the term
[16:33.960 --> 16:39.520]  racism they're invoking true-class warfare that's what Jimmy Carter is
[16:39.520 --> 16:49.360]  doing and the enforcers the police and the social workers they're they're they're
[16:49.360 --> 16:53.520]  being drawn from the ranks of the poor blacks the poor whites the poor Hispanics
[16:53.520 --> 16:58.280]  and they're going to be given badges and uniforms and clipboards and stun guns
[16:58.280 --> 17:03.960]  and patty wagons and they are going to take over every facet of your life I
[17:03.960 --> 17:09.960]  mean I'm reading the animal ID premises ID legislation and it says that the new
[17:09.960 --> 17:18.720]  definition of a farm is any growing plants or vegetables or animals or anyone
[17:18.720 --> 17:25.720]  with a warehouse and it says they're going to force you to sign over premises
[17:25.720 --> 17:30.640]  ID and it clearly states then that you are now a ward of the state and that the
[17:30.640 --> 17:34.400]  government holds your home in receivership I mean they're just taking
[17:34.400 --> 17:38.600]  over and in the country they're now hiring local bureaucrats and local
[17:38.600 --> 17:42.960]  environmentalists that come around and boss everybody around and if people in
[17:42.960 --> 17:48.160]  the countryside give into this it's over you will be complete sharecropper
[17:48.160 --> 17:58.240]  slaves and it's the same thing in the city and they are turning loose the
[17:58.240 --> 18:05.000]  desperate poor money-grubbing people that will do anything for money that's
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.960]  what big government is and just the CPS racket where they seize over a million
[18:10.960 --> 18:16.760]  children a year in the United States with no due process and then hop them up
[18:16.760 --> 18:23.920]  on drugs to get more taxpayer money that is a thousand times worse or more than
[18:23.920 --> 18:31.200]  everything a corn is doing so it's just like how can a star whenever Bill
[18:31.200 --> 18:35.680]  Clinton for sex with Monica Lewinsky and lying about it instead of missile
[18:35.680 --> 18:40.240]  secrets from Laurel and Hughes being given to the Communist Chinese because
[18:40.240 --> 18:44.520]  Bill Clinton was the only person that had sex with Monica Lewinsky and did
[18:44.520 --> 18:53.720]  disgusting things with cigars whether Bill Clinton engaged in all these other
[18:53.720 --> 18:58.240]  crimes with the Republican and Democratic leadership and so see he
[18:58.240 --> 19:05.080]  couldn't be burned over anything real the the hundreds and hundreds of
[19:05.080 --> 19:16.280]  different things he did but he could be burned over sex with a woman and it's
[19:16.280 --> 19:21.160]  the same kind of thing with acorn acorns a smaller upstart criminal group
[19:21.160 --> 19:27.360]  definitely totally seedy involved in every form of corruption known to man
[19:27.360 --> 19:32.480]  instantly ready your one-stop shop for criminal activity that much is clear I
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.520]  mean it goes back to resco and everybody else in Chicago and Obama with
[19:36.520 --> 19:44.560]  free houses and the guy he came up with in Chicago politics Rod Blagojevich and
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.560]  so you'll see Chicago corruption under the spotlight and the government will

[24:13.480 --> 24:17.680]  is the exact same thing you see with Anderson Cooper night after night month
[24:17.680 --> 24:24.760]  after month doing reports about Texas and scores of towns and counties where
[24:24.760 --> 24:30.960]  they pull you over including 85 year old women I mean they don't care and just
[24:30.960 --> 24:34.720]  grab your purse and wallet and laugh at you and then a lot of times they go
[24:34.720 --> 24:38.560]  ahead and arrest you and say if you sign this form which by the way is totally
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.320]  criminal these local police and boss hogs are so corrupt they don't know how
[24:43.320 --> 24:47.200]  they're incriminating themselves to say sign this form saying you agree not to
[24:47.200 --> 24:51.520]  ever challenge this in court and we're just going to take the $3,000 in your
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.680]  and your watch and we'll let you keep the wedding ring that happened in one case
[24:55.680 --> 25:02.720]  and these sheriffs and police chiefs and judges live in million dollar two
[25:02.720 --> 25:06.640]  million dollar homes they drive brand new trucks their kids have all got brand
[25:06.640 --> 25:12.520]  new four-wheelers they've got deer leases in Colorado and they don't care they
[25:12.520 --> 25:19.000]  just laugh it's like yeah we do we want and that's what government is because
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.800]  the American people began to let the government boss them around and tell us
[25:23.800 --> 25:27.080]  that we were their slaves and that they were the authorities and they were
[25:27.080 --> 25:33.320]  official but there's another wrinkle to this just like Anderson Cooper will
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.920]  cover local corruption in Texas or other states and laugh and talk about how
[25:38.920 --> 25:44.840]  it's the South as if the police aren't corrupt in the north but he's telling
[25:44.840 --> 25:49.520]  you about the little corruption the little bite the little problem so he can
[25:49.520 --> 25:57.760]  look good he doesn't tell you how the FBI shakes down businesses all over the
[25:57.760 --> 26:02.480]  country he doesn't tell you how the CIA ships in the majority of the narcotics
[26:02.480 --> 26:06.200]  and hunts down and kills anybody that doesn't want to their money through
[26:06.200 --> 26:10.000]  select banks that's come out in congressional hearings he doesn't tell
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.200]  you he's a CIA officer on record Anderson Cooper doesn't tell you that he
[26:15.200 --> 26:21.880]  tells you about boss hog who in a large percentage but not the majority of
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.520]  Texas counties because they've been getting away with it forever and I've
[26:26.520 --> 26:32.920]  had state senators uncovering it I mean it's Mafia run I've been pulled over in
[26:32.920 --> 26:35.520]  counties even though I'm from Texas and they ask what are you doing around here
[26:35.520 --> 26:41.880]  I'm driving through here and they get real smart ass with you until you notice
[26:41.880 --> 26:47.280]  they've got a swastika on their arm and then you say who I like your swastika
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.120]  just manipulating them and they say oh how little are you can go but it's not
[26:51.120 --> 26:54.840]  just picking on people who are from out of town or black or whatever they'll
[26:54.840 --> 26:58.960]  take old ladies money the state police will take their money they in fact they
[26:58.960 --> 27:01.920]  like shaking down old women that's in the news routinely for some reason it
[27:01.920 --> 27:09.720]  maybe it's it's old women that complain or maybe the media picks up on that when
[27:09.720 --> 27:15.000]  they do complain but see Anderson Cooper will tell you about that little low
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.560]  level corruption he will not tell you about the high level just like Fox News
[27:18.560 --> 27:23.400]  will show you acorn no matter where those investigators walked in across the
[27:23.400 --> 27:27.520]  country east coast west coast middle of the country hey I got 12 year old slave

[36:49.120 --> 36:55.200]  such such invocation of racism don't you understand when they make a racial
[36:55.200 --> 37:00.760]  issue that creates real division and I'm sick of it I'm sick of it I don't have
[37:00.760 --> 37:07.320]  any guilt I don't dislike anybody you understand that and I'm sick of growing

[37:17.640 --> 37:22.520]  of having race injected into everything I just want to live in peace I'm sick of
[37:22.520 --> 37:31.200]  it you sit up there on your fancy teleprompters in your fancy camera shots
[37:31.200 --> 37:35.120]  up there in your fancy suits lying to people people believe what you're
[37:35.120 --> 37:41.480]  saying doctor says flu vaccine will cost 60,000 deaths in France I want to get
[37:41.480 --> 37:46.360]  into that business week reports how China's yawn and become a global
[37:46.360 --> 37:54.520]  currency flu experts gear up for pandemic vaccine worry Democratic
[37:54.520 --> 38:01.720]  senator warns of big big tax on middle class in Bacchusville that's some of
[38:01.720 --> 38:06.120]  what's coming up cameras keep track of all cars entering Medina this is out of
[38:06.120 --> 38:10.840]  Seattle Times I love how they always report on local cities that are using
[38:10.840 --> 38:16.240]  license plate reading systems every city has this and if the feds haven't
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.200]  gotten around to flipping on the software at your local fusion center yet
[38:21.200 --> 38:24.080]  that's the only reason you don't know about it so we'll get into that total
[38:24.080 --> 38:29.440]  big brother sheriff's department responds to sonic device outrage they're now
[38:29.440 --> 38:35.280]  rolling out at town hall meetings everywhere sonic cannons homeland
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.160]  security member two years ago the head of the Air Force said it's illegal to use
[38:39.160 --> 38:43.840]  these sonic weapons that damage people's hearing against foreign enemies but if we
[38:43.840 --> 38:47.040]  use it against the American people it'll set the precedent to use it
[38:47.040 --> 38:55.160]  worldwide so we'll go over all of that I got a bunch of other news right now
[38:55.160 --> 38:59.560]  Carter racism plays major role in opposition to Obama we'll go over that
[38:59.560 --> 39:03.720]  but right now as promised let's go to your phone calls Stewart New York you're
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.320]  on the air hi Alex you had asked earlier as far as what we thought is the most
[39:09.320 --> 39:12.920]  important subject and it's kind of a toss-up between of course the
[39:12.920 --> 39:17.120]  revelations of 9-11 and the investigation of the fed but I have a
[39:17.120 --> 39:21.480]  feeling that if the fed was thoroughly investigated thoroughly audited from top
[39:21.480 --> 39:26.080]  to bottom with a microscope you would find out largely who was behind the money
[39:26.080 --> 39:31.720]  anyway as far as like 9-11 because as you recall a lot of insurance companies
[39:31.720 --> 39:38.440]  and stockbrokers who still remain secret made a lot of money right before and
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.880]  after 9-11 by shorting a certain airline stock yeah Alex Brown run by Buzzy
[39:43.880 --> 39:48.520]  Cron guard executive director of the CIA the German news reported the day before
[39:48.520 --> 39:52.960]  the attacks record puts on American and United and then they reported after it
[39:52.960 --> 39:57.040]  but never in our news they just sit there making money off what they did right
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.880]  in front of everybody laughing and why not they kidnap our kids and get away
[40:00.880 --> 40:04.560]  with it they ship heroin and cocaine and then get away with it and the media
[40:04.560 --> 40:10.080]  worships the CIA I'm just I've just had enough of it well it's a mafia group of
[40:10.080 --> 40:15.360]  parasites having their way with us yeah well somewhere that's got to show up in
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.600]  the coffers of the Federal Reserve and also if you could you know what Charlie
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.080]  was talking about how there were six people on the board investigating 9-11
[40:26.080 --> 40:29.720]  have come out and said it was a fraud what about the four that at least
[40:29.720 --> 40:33.200]  haven't said anything where's their money coming from who are they and what
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.960]  are they attached to well two of them are the chairman appointed by Bush so
[40:37.960 --> 40:45.040]  50% of those that support the official story of the 40% to prove of it 50% of
[40:45.040 --> 40:48.280]  them were appointed by Bush and then they appointed the other minions but I
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.680]  appreciate your call great points to it let's talk to Joshua in Florida Joshua
[40:52.680 --> 40:56.360]  you're on the air Alex Jones I do my friend hey buddy
[40:56.360 --> 41:00.480]  I got actually a lot to report from the Florida area I just want to say quickly
[41:00.480 --> 41:04.600]  we went through a of the second annual first responders benefit here in Orlando
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.360]  and our we are changed Florida group went with Central Florida veterans for
[41:08.360 --> 41:14.160]  peace and what we discovered we actually saw an Orange County Homeland
[41:14.160 --> 41:18.040]  Security trailer so they already had completely federalized here I was
[41:18.040 --> 41:22.800]  actually able to conduct an interview with one of the deputies and he said on
[41:22.800 --> 41:26.240]  record that they are now taking their marching orders directly from Homeland
[41:26.240 --> 41:31.840]  Security oh yeah they took no more local police everything's been federalized
[41:31.840 --> 41:37.200]  it's totally criminal and they're using the flu as the cover to bring in that
[41:37.200 --> 41:43.960]  implementation but look they're not talking about putting 379,000 regular
[41:43.960 --> 41:47.800]  troops on the streets because they want to play tiddlywinks they know when they
[41:47.800 --> 41:51.920]  take everything the public's got and take your savings that you're gonna get
[41:51.920 --> 41:55.320]  angry and when you come out on the streets they're gonna hit you with sound
[41:55.320 --> 41:59.240]  cannons and if that didn't work they're gonna mow everyone of you down and just
[41:59.240 --> 42:03.600]  got help this country yeah absolutely we we actually gave all the law
[42:03.600 --> 42:07.360]  enforcement there oath keepers literature and I want to encourage all the
[42:07.360 --> 42:11.160]  other resistance groups around the nation let's start engaging the police
[42:11.160 --> 42:13.880]  let's start engaging law enforcement let's let them know about oath keepers
[42:13.880 --> 42:17.400]  let's educate them and let's humanize ourselves that's really gonna be
[42:17.400 --> 42:21.640]  instrumental absolutely they teach the police and the federal training that
[42:21.640 --> 42:28.400]  there are terrorists and terrorists sympathizers everywhere and that that
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.480]  literally they're just terrorists hiding behind every bush meanwhile they don't
[42:33.480 --> 42:38.080]  tell them that supposed terrorists the patsies they set up were all trained at
[42:38.080 --> 42:43.600]  US military bases that the head of the US Embassy Springman so they were ordered
[42:43.600 --> 42:48.280]  to let Muhammad Atta and others in that they were really CIA officers the
[42:48.280 --> 42:50.880]  average cop doesn't know that that's why you've got to give them terror storm
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.520]  you've got to give them in game our very lives depend on getting the word out
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.200]  God bless you sir John in Oklahoma you're on the air
[42:59.200 --> 43:06.560]  hey hello Alex hey buddy you thank you so much and Charlie I'm looking to the
[43:06.560 --> 43:10.800]  West I'm standing in the middle of Oklahoma right now here's 21 quit here's
[43:10.800 --> 43:16.680]  the num question number 21 first I would re-enter I would like to speak to the
[43:16.680 --> 43:21.200]  families and all those who lost their lives 9-11 is probably the most
[43:21.200 --> 43:27.400]  important topic that should be discussed right now in the news for your
[43:27.400 --> 43:32.360]  query is it to what the most important question is and my grandmother used to
[43:32.360 --> 43:35.760]  help you know they lived in and well you don't know but they lived in the north
[43:35.760 --> 43:41.360]  and my family used to help you know everybody and we always feed feed
[43:41.360 --> 43:46.480]  everybody there's no racism in my family no I'm not saying people up north are
[43:46.480 --> 43:54.400]  all racist I'm saying I'm sick of how it's acceptable on CNN and on MSNBC to
[43:54.400 --> 43:58.800]  say we're all a bunch of toothless racist Klan members and there's
[43:58.800 --> 44:05.000]  congressman saying that the congressman said you lie once the Klan to ride in
[44:05.000 --> 44:11.040]  the streets of America the Klan are a bunch of feds question number 21 would
[44:11.040 --> 44:15.920]  be where are the bodies and my heart goes out to all the families and those
[44:15.920 --> 44:20.760]  who lost lives where are the people that were lost that should be the question
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.720]  I don't hear any discussion why were the bodies in the towers all blown into
[44:24.720 --> 44:28.840]  pieces smaller than an inch I hear you John get to hear from you Steve and
[44:28.840 --> 44:34.480]  Chicago Steve you're on the air go ahead yes Alex I was disturbed by a an
[44:34.480 --> 44:39.800]  article I read a little excerpts of it I was in the Chicago Daily Herald and it
[44:39.800 --> 44:44.680]  says Skokie Holocaust Museum holds conference for law enforcement and it
[44:44.680 --> 44:49.880]  goes on to say that this was a museum modeled on the federal Holocaust Museum
[44:49.880 --> 44:55.600]  in Washington DC now some of the people in attendance were members of the U.S.
[44:55.600 --> 44:59.600]  Customs Service Chicago Police Department Chicago Fire Department Suburban
[44:59.600 --> 45:05.280]  Fire Departments etc but what what really upset me it says that Lonnie
[45:05.280 --> 45:11.200]  Nazatour legal regional director of the American Defonet defamation league says
[45:11.200 --> 45:16.840]  nearly 50,000 law enforcement professionals have participated nationally
[45:16.840 --> 45:23.280]  already including new FBI agents and analysts yes it is the ADL it is the ADL
[45:23.280 --> 45:28.080]  that wrote the Southern Poverty Law Center documents that they put out the
[45:28.080 --> 45:31.080]  Southern Poverty Law Center writes a lot of the documents that then get
[45:31.080 --> 45:36.120]  reshuffled around by ADL they both work together it was the ADL the Southern
[45:36.120 --> 45:42.240]  Poverty Law Center that wrote the Mayak reports the DHS reports it is literal
[45:42.240 --> 45:46.740]  carbon copy of what they put out so they do is they get police in a Holocaust
[45:46.740 --> 45:52.760]  Museum bring up Nazi Germany and then psychologically superimpose the Nazis
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.520]  onto the American people conservatives gun owners and push for the passage of
[45:57.520 --> 46:01.720]  the hate crimes bill push for the passage of restrictions of free speech I
[46:01.720 --> 46:05.520]  appreciate your call and all over the news I was on the treadmill this morning
[46:05.520 --> 46:11.400]  watching CNN they were saying oh yes we have hate speech going on and it leads
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.120]  to hate crime we've got a ban criticizing the president it's all
[46:15.120 --> 46:22.440]  racism and so that's how the Soviet Union operated and so it doesn't matter
[46:22.440 --> 46:26.560]  if our grandparents fought Hitler we are Hitler when we don't want to turn our
[46:26.560 --> 46:31.160]  guns in we have now become Hitler and that's what the police have been taught
[46:31.160 --> 46:35.720]  the American people are Hitler and the police are Simon Wiesenthal hunting us
[46:35.720 --> 46:40.960]  down let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Pennsylvania Scott you're on the air
[46:40.960 --> 46:46.880]  hi Alex I took my daughter to the doctor today and it was pretty bad I had a big
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.640]  fight with the doctor about getting shot he tried to what gave you to take the
[46:50.640 --> 46:54.880]  guard to sell and the flu shot well my daughter's four so he tried to get all
[46:54.880 --> 46:59.040]  the shots that she has it for and I don't know what they are a big fight huh I
[46:59.040 --> 47:02.600]  thought it was your discretion did he did he threaten you and say that it was
[47:02.600 --> 47:07.240]  your fault she was gonna get sick and that it was that if she got sick it
[47:07.240 --> 47:11.720]  could be neglect because all of that's criminal what he did if he did that well
[47:11.720 --> 47:15.000]  what he did was he asked me about my other daughter and after in daycare and
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.440]  how old they are what they eat you know if they watch too much TV well you know
[47:20.440 --> 47:24.040]  they've been told to ask those questions do you own guns do they live TV do you
[47:24.040 --> 47:28.160]  have enough money and he reports all that criminally to the child rape rings
[47:28.160 --> 47:34.280]  of the CPS and he gets money for that so when I drop off my kid to daycare what
[47:34.280 --> 47:38.960]  should I be worried about hearing from CPS instead of actually did he try to
[47:38.960 --> 47:46.080]  question your children alone no well I mean it's come out in federal guidelines
[47:46.080 --> 47:51.280]  they threaten the doctors it's all the dentured servitude to spy to ask
[47:51.280 --> 47:56.040]  questions when you have a baby they'll ask the mail oh you go give this file to
[47:56.040 --> 48:00.400]  the desk outside then they say honey you have enough money hey how's he treating
[48:00.400 --> 48:03.680]  you and the woman thinks she's talking to a you know one of her girlfriend oh
[48:03.680 --> 48:07.960]  you know he's kind of a he's all right you know when she's about to have a baby
[48:07.960 --> 48:11.640]  she's stressed out and then they're just sitting there wanting cash money bonus on
[48:11.640 --> 48:15.920]  the table to seize that child hardcore criminals little control freak scumbags
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.160]  but no I mean I mean just explain to me more what the little slime ball was
[48:20.160 --> 48:25.200]  doing well I had handouts in my car that I was gonna bring in because I didn't
[48:25.200 --> 48:30.120]  expect a fight but my daughter kind of wanted to go in and you know visit the
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.120]  doctor so I decided to leave him in the car visit the eugenicist that doesn't
[48:35.120 --> 48:39.800]  even do a Hippocratic oath anymore okay yeah so I wanted to visit the Nazi doctor
[48:39.800 --> 48:43.560]  that's who they go ahead I had these handouts from when I went to the swine
[48:43.560 --> 48:49.080]  flu conference a couple weeks ago and let me guess the high priest was
[48:49.080 --> 48:53.200]  shocked that you even knew how to talk I mean did he get upset that you weren't
[48:53.200 --> 48:58.720]  bowing down to his white coat well he wouldn't show me the insert with what
[48:58.720 --> 49:02.800]  was in the shot I well they admitted has the Marisol that's associated press
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.760]  oh let me guess he lied to you yeah yeah he said you know I asked about the
[49:08.760 --> 49:13.720]  mercury in the shot and he said well there is mercury in the shot but that's
[49:13.720 --> 49:19.920]  not harmful oh I said well well matted as a hatter as in that's a quote from the
[49:19.920 --> 49:26.360]  1800s and you know he just avoided the question oh my god you knew how to say
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.440]  1800 that was probably for pretty much of a big shake up knowing how to talk now
[49:30.440 --> 49:35.880]  but everybody just watches TV and does what they're told yeah well look so how
[49:35.880 --> 49:39.680]  did this end with the flu shot I mean why don't you just give him major
[49:39.680 --> 49:43.160]  medical studies that if your kid takes three flu shots they double their
[49:43.160 --> 49:49.440]  chances of neurological disorders I mean I made a handout and I handed it to
[49:49.440 --> 49:56.880]  his receptionist and I left a whole bunch in his office of stories from your
[49:56.880 --> 50:00.600]  site about the swine flu Jack and then he got upset started asking about the
[50:00.600 --> 50:05.000]  school he may try to send some kidnappers I don't know because they do it
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.760]  openly just kidnap whoever they want and give them a different I mean it's just
[50:08.760 --> 50:13.160]  total crime we have to hate them we have to be disgusted by them we have to find
[50:13.160 --> 50:18.360]  our anger again and recognize that government is scum filled and criminals
[50:18.360 --> 50:23.200]  are breeding everywhere using government authority as the nexus point to have
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.000]  their control freak religious services with us see it's all about the religion
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.480]  of the control freak scum so how did this end well she didn't get the shots
[50:33.480 --> 50:38.720]  and we left so everything's fine now was he breathing heavy though the slave
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.600]  didn't dare serving oh yeah he was upset well you can do a search in your town
[50:44.600 --> 50:49.800]  for a anti-vaccine doctor or one who won't try to force them on you but look
[50:49.800 --> 50:55.120]  I've been ranting over you I want to hear more about what this doctor did when
[50:55.120 --> 50:57.560]  you didn't want to inject mercury directly in the bloodstream of your
[50:57.560 --> 51:04.240]  child mercury it's the new vitamin when it comes to emergency preparedness you
[51:04.240 --> 51:08.000]  know it's the responsible thing to do for you and your family you also know
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.120]  that preparedness though a necessity can cost hundreds even thousands of dollars

[51:16.560 --> 51:21.120]  situations for many preparedness has been placed on the back burner this year

[54:01.320 --> 54:26.000]  you can run on for a long time that's how corruption works that's why 99% of
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.880]  the time governments fall to complete corruption everybody lives in squalor
[54:30.880 --> 54:35.200]  homeless on the street except for one tenth of one percent that live in big
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.680]  palaces than that are worshiped and then a few decades later their kid becomes
[54:40.680 --> 54:44.600]  dictator and then a few decades later their kid becomes dictator and then
[54:44.600 --> 54:48.000]  they suddenly start wearing gold crowns and being worshiped and they get a
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.120]  bunch of people and big fancy uniforms and outfits to start bowing before them
[54:52.120 --> 55:02.000]  and pretty soon they're called royalty and that's how this works period and it
[55:02.000 --> 55:08.600]  is a fact that people are taking a flu shot from last year that has no
[55:08.600 --> 55:13.480]  connection to the new flu and gives them no protection they're not gonna have the
[55:13.480 --> 55:18.640]  new flu shot for the next two weeks and then that is already in trials causing
[55:18.640 --> 55:24.120]  serious medical problems but they don't care my neighbors are all running out to
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.960]  shoot their kids up year after year with mercury brain damaging them and it's
[55:28.960 --> 55:35.200]  funny to them because these cowardly jackasses I shouldn't be mean these poor
[55:35.200 --> 55:40.440]  people think that if they just rationalize and say oh it's not bad for
[55:40.440 --> 55:45.400]  them that it makes it okay I've got major German newspapers with the fact that
[55:45.400 --> 55:51.560]  hardcore cancer viruses are in the current flu shot so you've got the
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.120]  floor sir instead of me ranting at you tell me briefly exactly how this
[55:56.120 --> 56:01.320]  transpired this argument with the doctor well I sent my story to writers at
[56:01.320 --> 56:06.440]  info wars calm but I was waiting in the waiting room and the doctor first came
[56:06.440 --> 56:11.800]  in and noticed that the immunizations were missing and I told them that they
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.880]  weren't necessary and then he started to rattle off about how they're the best
[56:15.880 --> 56:21.840]  things that were ever given to kids and I asked them why they are put in
[56:21.840 --> 56:28.040]  mercury squalene and cancer viruses in the shots and you know he he never said
[56:28.040 --> 56:33.000]  that they didn't have shots or that they and that and they didn't have mercury or
[56:33.000 --> 56:39.080]  squalene or viruses but he suggested that we find another doctor and I and I
[56:39.080 --> 56:42.520]  told him that we have talked to other doctors in his practice about not taking
[56:42.520 --> 56:48.520]  shots and they were fine with us denying the shots and then he tried to push the
[56:48.520 --> 56:54.280]  shots again saying it was good for the kids and then I asked but I mean yeah
[56:54.280 --> 56:59.800]  but I mean if it's the best thing it's better than fluoride for kids doubling
[56:59.800 --> 57:04.800]  the bone cancer rate government studies brain cancer rates expanding other
[57:04.800 --> 57:09.840]  cancers expanding thyroid problems I mean 40% of American women now have
[57:09.840 --> 57:14.880]  thyroid problems directly linked to fluoride I mean what they're killing us
[57:14.880 --> 57:19.320]  I'm sick of it and you run into these doctors that are these little power
[57:19.320 --> 57:24.720]  tripping control freaks I say you find another doctor but listen I'm glad that

[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:13.680]  weather and the the military affecting the weather I had first-hand experience
[1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:18.260]  to that a couple years ago I mean everybody always has their first-hand
[1:01:18.260 --> 1:01:22.320]  experience or witnesses it the government now admits that the Pentagon
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:27.800]  NASA the Department of Energy are terraforming and spring barium salts and
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:32.880]  aluminum dioxide in the atmosphere I mean I told it's easy but 495
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:36.960]  contrails in step they're more than two or three minutes and they formed at 20
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:42.600]  30 40,000 feet now it forms at 2,000 feet and it blacks out the sun I mean
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.760]  they're they're chem trailing us well a couple years ago I had a friend of mine
[1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:52.320]  who was former full for full bird Colonel India the Air Force he called me any
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:55.640]  any told me look up a couple things I'm not going to tell you what they are but
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:01:59.120]  you need to look it up to see how you good you are I followed the trail led
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:03.920]  me to an article about NASA learning how to create hurricanes when I told them
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:06.840]  about that this was about the same time that Florida was hit with those
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:10.800]  all those earth those hurricanes his only response to me was funny how that
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:14.760]  works well in the article it mentioned three things and then mentioned the
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:19.720]  vellum allen radiation belt the Bermuda Triangle on Holloman Air Force Base two
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:25.120]  years later I was outside in New Mexico just outside of Holloman Air Force Base
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:30.520]  east of it or excuse me west of it and I watched this electrical storm taking
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:35.440]  place that had a pattern and for 20 minutes I stood out there with a friend
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:38.560]  and we watched as the electricity shot back and forth like two people were
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:41.920]  shooting at themselves it was the most amazing thing I thought yeah their
[1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:46.280]  control freaks they want to control your family control your water control the
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:51.480]  environment control the atmosphere control genetics they want to be gods
[1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:56.360]  day when I turned on the television Alex there it talked about in the Bermuda
[1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:59.680]  Triangle area there was a hurricane that popped up which tied together
[1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:03.320]  everything that I had read in that article because it mentioned Holloman and
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:06.680]  the Bermuda Triangle I could only imagine that because of what they were
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:09.640]  doing the effect on the Van Allen radiation belt so they've been doing
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:15.840]  this for a while yes I appreciate your call we interviewed Ben Livingston the
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:21.400]  father of weather weapons a listener five years ago sent me documents that
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.840]  have been declassified and it had been living since names they had in the
[1:03:24.840 --> 1:03:28.520]  program so I called him up and I said are you aware of this was declassified he
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:35.200]  said no so I interviewed him in the AP Fox others picked it up and he came out
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:41.440]  and spoke about weather weapons and he said I don't understand why they let
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:47.360]  Hurricane Katrina and all these others hit he talked about it before Katrina
[1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:51.800]  and then after I don't understand why they allow this to happen we can control
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:55.440]  hurricanes we could create them kill them weaken them make them stronger
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:04:02.400]  certified 1967 we were doing it in 62-63 but certified that we could do it and
[1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:09.400]  how to do it had a manual on it in 67 now they got to Livingston I started
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:12.000]  calling him to get him back on he said look I'm not gonna talk to you or the
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.760]  media anymore that's all I'm gonna say basically national security so they
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:24.760]  went to Livingston and said shut up shut up and yes all these hurricanes with
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:30.240]  two eyes hurricanes that sit there in the Gulf for a week and then come in well
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:34.160]  Secretary of Defense Cohen said they had weather weapons in 1997 at a press
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:39.920]  conference and yes they are manipulating our weather they're playing God they
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:44.160]  want to bankrupt the farms and ranches so they can force you into government

[1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:08.480]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:16.800]  Dan, Vance, Kathy, Steve, many others your calls are coming up what do you think
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:21.160]  the most important issue is we're facing right now the UN controlling the
[1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:26.240]  global response to the flu through the federal governments and in the local
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:30.800]  governments the entire planet now under UN control the UN brags they're using
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:36.760]  this as a drill to train the public to accept global governance the new bank of
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:41.960]  the world being set up Obama wanting to sign us under the administrative yoke of
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:49.760]  offshore banks through his new financial restructuring the talking point in the
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:56.000]  media is we're gonna have a depression if we don't get this financial
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  reforms through we you know the banks are bad and they're out of control that's
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.800]  why we've got to give the banks unlimited power to run our lives and
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:09.880]  expand derivatives of course they don't say it that way they say all the banks
[1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:13.280]  are still corrupt and they're still getting big bonuses and nothing's been
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:17.840]  changed in a year and but Obama's got a plan to fix it we better do it or we're
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:22.840]  gonna have a depression Bernanke says so then you actually look at the plan
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:27.960]  unlimited power over all businesses in the United States same thing in every
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:31.320]  other country we're just going into receivership just like third world
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:36.720]  countries to the IMF and World Bank it's all done through fraud either we
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:41.360]  investigate and indict and arrest the bankers for all the crimes they've
[1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:45.800]  committed publicly or they're going to pose as the saviors and take over and
[1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:50.800]  get even more power and they happen to be control freak eugenicist whose number
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:55.360]  one passion is getting a world government so they can kill the majority of
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:02.200]  us that's really the big issue are they going to use stage terror to get their
[1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:05.840]  operations through is Israel going to hit Iran they're saying they're getting
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:14.080]  ready to what will happen if that happens 1-800-259-9231 for a parent

[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:57.680]  of the Roman system what they would do two thousand years ago more coming up
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:01.800]  big news blitz but let's take more your calls Dan in New York you're on the
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:08.720]  air welcome my friend what's on your mind I got a couple questions for you
[1:12:08.720 --> 1:12:12.080]  we're calling regards I've watched a few of the videos that a friend of mine is
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:17.320]  to show me one is going to be the dark secret of anything cold and the one I
[1:12:17.320 --> 1:12:20.880]  just kind of watching was the blueprint of the global involvement the end game
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:28.520]  and this is all new to me I'm being in the military that I am it's like to
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:35.000]  watching these videos and somewhat of informed what would I guess what's the
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:40.240]  next step and how would you say we stop this and then a lot of people ask me
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:45.520]  what is the next step all I can do is try to show people what the globalists
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:51.760]  are doing what their plan is how they operate their own documents their own
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:55.640]  statements of how they want a world government to carry out our ordered
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:59.160]  extermination and that's what the White House science are wrote in his big
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:02.960]  textbook that came out a few months ago and you notice all that information is
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:08.200]  already in the end game because we went to the UN documents themselves but it's
[1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:13.240]  always the same information the question is what are you going to do about it if
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:17.880]  you know that they've sterilized troops nerve gas troops kidnapped and
[1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:23.000]  radiated to death foster children murdered black people in test why would
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.560]  any of us trust any vaccines they push on us now when we know there's cancer
[1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:31.800]  viruses in the new vaccine when we know it's been killing people in trials when
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:38.000]  we know it killed people in trials and 76 the I mean I'm not here to tell
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.760]  everybody what to do I'm busy saying okay let's audit the Fed these private
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:47.520]  eugenics families get all their power through the issuance of fiat currency
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:52.000]  and credit you expose that front and how they create these debt bubbles by
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:58.080]  designed to get us under their control that's a huge blow you expose their flu
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:02.760]  program get the police and military and medical workers who refuse to take it
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:06.360]  then they won't have the enforcers to make us take it then they may release
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:11.560]  another soft kill kill a bunch of us to scare us into taking it you expose how
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:16.760]  they've been caught using vaccines to sterilize people you educate people
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:20.840]  about the Tenth Amendment and states rights and get states to pass laws saying
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:24.320]  they're not going under federal control you go to your local city council
[1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:29.400]  meeting you expose how the feds are federalizing local police you expose
[1:14:29.400 --> 1:14:34.840]  how north comes openly taking over the country illegally I mean there are so
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:40.240]  many issues the big thing is you get involved you go to city council you go
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:46.360]  to town halls you realize that the party out of power the Democrats exposed
[1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:51.400]  Bush but as soon as they got in power they continued everything Bush did you
[1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:55.560]  realize Glenn Beck is exposing Obama now but when the Republicans are in power
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:59.920]  he's gonna support the banker bailouts the police state you shatter the left
[1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:05.920]  right paradigm they confuse us they manipulate us with false terms and false
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:12.600]  debates and thespian Shakespearean theater you cut through that and see the
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:19.400]  real battlefield and one cannot be told about this matrix like Alice in Wonderland
[1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:27.240]  system one has to see it for yourself but you spread the information again if
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:32.920]  there's an awakening a good healthy mistrust of government then if people
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.920]  just don't here's an example there were cops all over 360 this morning driving
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:41.280]  into work giving people tickets and they give you tickets for five miles over the
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:44.400]  speed limit now people don't have the money they admit it's just a raise
[1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:48.280]  revenue 10% of Texans or more have warrants out for their arrest people
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:52.280]  just don't have the money I remember back in the 80s when I first started
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:58.160]  driving people would flash you to warn you of police and people had quit doing
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:03.200]  that I noticed people were flashing so I started flashing and that was a
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:09.480]  communal exercise as citizens sticking up for each other so we you defeat the
[1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:14.000]  new world order with basic things like that flashing your lights when you see
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:20.440]  the police again you get that's what Americans always did you don't trust the
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:24.640]  system you don't like the system you don't let the government shove you around
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:30.240]  or order you around you get an attitude of liberty a spirit of 1776 again do you
[1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:37.960]  see what I'm saying I mean what are your ideas sir hold on hold on I mean I
[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:42.600]  want to hear your question but I mean I'm asking you have you're a smart guy
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:47.760]  you tell me all I can do is warn people that psychopathic criminals around the
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:52.920]  system what do we do well that's why I'm that's why I'm trying to get informed
[1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:56.200]  I mean this is all I'm new to me I've never heard of any of this I've never
[1:16:56.200 --> 1:17:00.280]  seen any of this and then there's a there's a friend of mine it's actually
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:03.920]  here with me right now that is a show me some of these videos and a lot of me
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:08.040]  and inform me on some of the stuff that's going on and so I figured you know
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:12.520]  and I'm here and debated with him on some of these things so now I figured I
[1:17:12.520 --> 1:17:16.200]  would come to the person that's actually created all this and ask you a couple
[1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:20.960]  questions okay go ahead ask your other question the next thing I would have is
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:25.080]  with net the new national health care that they're trying to push through do
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:29.840]  you believe that it's the next step in the end of you up they state they have
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:34.360]  to have quote free health care that everybody pays for with taxes so they
[1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:39.440]  can carry out the one-child policies the CPSing of your children the forced
[1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:44.080]  inoculations where the government decides what procedures you get and it's
[1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:49.640]  all in the bills and that's why Obama's approval ratings are plunging because
[1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:53.800]  this isn't 20 years ago where they could just lie about what's in the bill the
[1:17:53.800 --> 1:17:59.720]  people now are seeing the subsections and yes the government run health care if
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:02.920]  they wanted to fix things they'd let you carry your insurance outside your state
[1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:07.520]  they would get rid of government regulation that's what screwed everything
[1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:12.800]  up instead it's more government so they can get control of 20% more of the
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:24.080]  economy okay well appreciate the phone call you bet God bless you last thing do
[1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:31.400]  not believe in game go to what is the end game calm the bibliography watch the
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:35.200]  video clips link through to the government documents see the United

[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:27.840]  understand their own species they understand how to manipulate the
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:36.400]  people and we have to just break out of the trance and start looking for the
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:42.120]  agenda start looking for the manipulation and when we do that we can

[1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:53.000]  go back to your calls let's talk to Vance in Texas Vance you're on the
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:25:00.680]  air Alex God bless you man I just want to say man I really appreciate everything
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:06.200]  that you and Charlie Sheen are doing Ron Paul leading the revolution I just
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:10.400]  really appreciate it and God bless you all for everything that you've done well
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:17.240]  thank you sir I actually am from the northeast part of Texas and I moved down
[1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:21.640]  here to Austin Texas to see about even if it was at all possible to work with
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:28.400]  you in any way actually live right over here on moped right down the block down
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:34.960]  from Lamar well my problem is I'm so busy working that we've never really had
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:39.440]  the money to get a bigger office we've just now expanded we're busy getting the
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:44.720]  permits finishing that up the problem is I just can't open the place up to open
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:49.000]  employment because they have tried to infiltrate us thought that we're doing
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:53.920]  anything wrong they try to put people in here to do things wrong they're
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:26:00.960]  completely criminal and so we've tried to keep our operations small plus there's
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:05.240]  the issue of financing to be able to pay a bunch of employees then if we have a
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:10.040]  bunch of volunteers in here again a lot of volunteers just want to come and be
[1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:14.920]  groupies and there is no groupie stuff going on here it's all work it's all
[1:26:14.920 --> 1:26:19.600]  research it's it's it's total dedication but and I'm not saying that's what you
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:26.880]  are but but I don't feel like just because you don't work with me that you
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:30.760]  can't go out and start your own operation or your own group or your own
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:34.400]  online radio show or your own newsletter or make your own online
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:41.800]  documentaries or go do your own access TV show in Austin Texas go sign up take
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:46.080]  a couple classes takes a few months go talk to 10,000 people every night on
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:54.120]  access TV a huge viewership on basic cable let's see you know you get in the
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:27:00.600]  minor leagues there and and another and I appreciate your call another big
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:07.600]  frustration I have is we wake people up and then we don't tell people what to do
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:11.000]  or who to join or who to be part of and then they go become minions of going
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:15.960]  back they go become minions of white supremacist or minions of crazy
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:22.920]  Catholic run at all groups or minions of the UFO cult movements out there all
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:28.280]  these groups that kind of want to show off that they cover the most bizarre most
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:37.280]  extreme and it's kind of a race to the bottom of who can in fight the most and
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:42.040]  who can be the nastiest and who can be the weirdest so really I don't work with
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:46.120]  a lot of people because I've been stabbing the back so much I kind of just
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:52.120]  sit back and do my own thing but there are a lot of good people out there
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:56.480]  taking action getting involved in their communities and I salute all of you out
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:03.080]  there for what you're doing but so many people spend their time just focusing on
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:07.800]  what this person should do or what that person should do or what message we
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:13.320]  should put out I just exposed the private central banks I call for an audit
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:18.480]  and the abolishment of the private Fed and to monetize the debt through the
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:25.160]  federal government through the Congress I called for openly having a
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:28.960]  discussion about the world government and about the superstructure that
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:35.320]  controls our society and cutting past the false political facade or matrix
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:43.080]  that's pulled up over our eyes to blind us from the real world but it does
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:46.240]  freak me out to watch Glenn Beck and him say I'm worried about our republic
[1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:52.120]  falling I want to save our republic I both parties are controlled but then he
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:56.840]  comes out and says Al Qaeda is going to attack you support the Patriot Act we've
[1:28:56.840 --> 1:29:01.160]  got to invade more countries the banker bailout bill is good and Ron Paul
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:05.600]  supporters are dangerous and he's not sure about the Mayak and DHS reports
[1:29:05.600 --> 1:29:15.280]  maybe they're good this is the type of stuff that I deal with and it freaks me
[1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:20.200]  out to see Obama pick up the we are change I mean they watch what we do
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:23.880]  they're aware that we're the real revolution they're concerned about us
[1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:29.400]  and they come and mimic everything we say and do so that as we wake people up
[1:29:29.400 --> 1:29:34.800]  they then just get co-opted back into the system that's why I say don't follow
[1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:38.600]  me don't follow anybody question everything I say question everything the
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:43.760]  establishment says but also demand verified information because so many of
[1:29:43.760 --> 1:29:49.080]  the quote alternative media just to send and disinformation and squabbles and

[1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:54.880]  notice and they start rushing and then suddenly everybody's trying to get out

[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:21.920]  real they have used the dollar running it up into the tens of trillions in debt
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.040]  to buy up the world to buy up infrastructure to buy up media to buy up
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:31.800]  arms contractors the private banks use your family your name your credit to buy
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:35.760]  the world now you're gonna pay the banks not just for the money you gave them but
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:41.280]  for the interest on it and no investment is perfect but I'll tell you the elites
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:45.600]  hoard gold and silver and art and precious metals and real estate and
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:51.160]  nothing's more portable than gold and silver precious gems aren't bad but
[1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:55.080]  it's too hard to value them it's too hard to buy them you know they usually have a
[1:39:55.080 --> 1:39:59.040]  two three times markup gold and silver doesn't you can get gold and silver right
[1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:03.960]  down at spot and Ted's got it at below spot he but now he still got one thing
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:10.440]  left from the two from the 945 level that he's been having for two weeks one
[1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:14.840]  thing left all the other stuff sold out he did buy though when it went up again
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:21.040]  but was wonder what it is now so we have a new incredible deal Ted Anderson tell
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:24.560]  folks about what you have to offer for him today well I'll tell you this right
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:27.720]  now you mentioned that the globalists are trying to force the gold prices down
[1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:31.480]  but if that's the case they're losing the battle gold went up to a thousand
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:34.960]  twenty one today the ten dollar Liberty is the one coin that if you don't
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:39.520]  mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones special it'll literally cost you
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:44.680]  $200 more per coin to buy it at this time because I did pick that up at the
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:49.440]  945 level it's the one of the few things that I have left in my stock that I can
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:53.680]  still sell at that level that's they're currently right now at 818 50 that's the
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:40:58.160]  old ten dollar Liberty from back at the turn of the century many people call them
[1:40:58.160 --> 1:41:03.160]  non confiscatable coins they're the pre-1933 coin of very good value there's
[1:41:03.160 --> 1:41:07.560]  no question about it the other thing that I have right now still is the silver
[1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:13.840]  and that's this walking Liberty half at 869 I just I can't say it enough right
[1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:19.320]  now I think it's gone beyond any point of reason at all it just makes dumb
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:25.040]  logical sense to to buy gold and silver you know it's just it even the even
[1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:28.760]  somebody entering into the marketplace that knows very little about where they
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:31.760]  should put their money are gonna look into it and go because there's so much
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:35.480]  trouble here in the United States that I better do something that it has a
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:41.480]  complete and the entire separation from this fiat system that we use here Ted I
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:45.760]  know doctors and lawyers that I've known for years and they just can't make
[1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:50.160]  themselves buy gold and their stockbroker bosses them around and makes
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:56.160]  fun of them and they say oh I know I heard you six years ago when it was 300
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:01.600]  an ounce say buy it and I've lost 30 40 50% the stock market but I'm just gonna
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:07.400]  stay in they are just jackasses they love being idiots that's exactly what
[1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:11.920]  it is I mean like I said it's it's stupid sense now I mean people even the
[1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:16.120]  doctors and the physicians and the yuppies and and the educated Harvard
[1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:20.120]  graduates and whatever it is that you've done in your life that makes you think
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:25.080]  that you're so smart can even identify with the fact that the United States is
[1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:29.080]  seeing a tremendous amount of trouble and that the world is trying to get away
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:32.800]  from the US currency and that the globalists are trying to do the same
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:37.920]  thing by by building a world currency I mean it's just I mean the handwriting is
[1:42:37.920 --> 1:42:42.160]  on the wall it's in the you know it's in the front page of the of the major
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:47.120]  newspapers and major websites I mean come on people wake up a little bit here
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:50.960]  if you haven't gotten involved with the gold and silver I would suggest that you
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:54.440]  do it and you do it in a serious manner if you're sitting there with the stock
[1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:59.480]  still if you're in the bond market I mean Alex even if you have an IRA you can
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:05.320]  still put that IRA into gold you don't have to have it sitting in paper and it
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:08.760]  doesn't have to be in paper mining stocks or anything like that you can
[1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:12.680]  actually have it in physical gold so you can take advantage of the fact that you
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:17.440]  have something that's completely well Ted nobody is offering gold that I know
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:22.160]  of at the price you're talking about what happened with the silver well that's
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:26.480]  the thing I mean silver's gone up over $17 an ounce now there's no way that I'm
[1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:29.800]  gonna be able to hold on to these walkers down at this price I've you know
[1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:35.840]  I what when other dealers are trying to figure out how to you know how to manage
[1:43:35.840 --> 1:43:39.960]  their profits in their best manner what I'm doing when the markets going down and
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:43.920]  everybody is walking away from this stuff it gives me that opportunity to go
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:47.880]  in and buy into the marketplace priced at the bid side of the market rather than
[1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:52.840]  the ask and accumulate coins while the prices are low and because I have that
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:56.760]  inventory to have the margin I need I'm able to sell it and really quite
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:01.280]  literally I picked up a tremendous amount of walking liberty halves just so
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:05.680]  because I mean that in my mind I knew that silver would be going up you know
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:10.280]  Ted I'm making the gamble for you and it paid off I mean it well Ted this is
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:15.040]  like a time machine though you're smart you buy when it's lower in the dips you
[1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:20.600]  sell at the low price during the highs when everybody else goes up people cannot
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:26.200]  beat a deal where you're selling it for below spot with the silver not gonna be
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:30.360]  there long how much was silver when you bought into the market at that price
[1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:35.720]  that was when silver was trading at between 11 and 1115 right in there okay
[1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:41.480]  so you're selling silver at an 11 1115 market when it's above $17 an ounce I
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:45.520]  mean in clear English ladies and gentlemen do you understand that Ted isn't
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:55.320]  gonna have many of these left for long 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 the brokers
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:59.720]  will be there till midnight and he does have that one gold coin left at the 945
[1:44:59.720 --> 1:45:03.320]  level when the market was lower he still got other great deals what about
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:07.480]  pricing other coins where are you at in the market in the last buys you did on
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:11.400]  the other coins well like for instance I had to raise the Lakota Nation round of
[1:45:11.400 --> 1:45:18.200]  $22 and 30 cents when silver went up to that $14 level while silver's at 5th
[1:45:18.200 --> 1:45:23.200]  went up to 17 bucks and I think I have somewhere around 1500 of those coins
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:27.080]  left at that level so you know the next time I enter into the marketplace to buy
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:32.680]  now I'm at $17 and nobody can buy them at spot they don't trade at that level so
[1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:37.280]  now I'm going to be sitting closer to 25 bucks on that particular coin there's
[1:45:37.280 --> 1:45:40.800]  just a whole long variety of different things that I have if you want to take
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:44.240]  advantage of the offers I've had a few things that I have been able to sit in
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:47.600]  supply I just don't have enough of them to talk about on the radio because by
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:50.680]  the time somebody calls in for them they're going to be gone so just ask
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:59.040]  about different Alex Jones specials 800-800-686-2237 Ted thanks for giving
[1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:06.400]  us that update yeah thanks for having me up Alex you bet and folks it it's kind
[1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:13.160]  of pleasurable satisfying to know we were right and to tell you that in the
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:18.760]  fall it would go above a thousand but there's no pleasure in saying see I told
[1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:22.560]  you so it's kind of like when it comes out the White House science are wrote a
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:28.000]  government policy book about how they're drugging the water supply I've already
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.840]  got hundreds of other government documents and textbooks and statements it
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:36.160]  isn't fun to be right about this it isn't fun to know they may completely
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:41.280]  implode the dollar it isn't fun to know foreign banks are raping my country that
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:47.280]  my children live in the only satisfaction is knowing that some of you beat
[1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:53.160]  the bankers and bought gold when it was $500 less than it is now and I guess
[1:46:53.160 --> 1:46:57.280]  there's some satisfaction in not being complete schmucks complete suckers
[1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:05.280]  complete idiots I mean our track record is so accurate so good we're not perfect
[1:47:05.280 --> 1:47:08.840]  we make a few mistakes but at least we're trying to tell you the truth at
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:13.000]  least we're trying to lay out what's really happening at least we know who
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:18.880]  the enemy is the offshore banks all right let me head a bunch of news then
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:23.760]  we'll go to your calls representative Alan Grayson has announced a hearing to
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:33.080]  audit the Fed and so again representative Alan Grayson has announced a
[1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:42.320]  hearing for auditing the Fed bill and so that is definitely moving down the line
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:46.320]  and and we may not get it audited or abolished this time but people are now
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:51.520]  identifying hey Obama's a puppet hey Bush was a puppet hey there's these
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:48:00.200]  bankers that are above the law they're the issue thank you it was announced
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:06.640]  today earlier today that there will be a hearing on HR 1207 the bill to audit the
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:10.880]  Federal Reserve Bank this will be the first independent audit in the Federal
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:15.600]  Reserve's 96 year history and it's long overdue months ago I asked the vice
[1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:19.080]  chairman of the Federal Reserve who received the one trillion dollars in
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:23.120]  funds that the Federal Reserve has handed out to domestic institutions he said
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:26.720]  I'm not going to tell you and then more recently the chairman of the Federal
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:32.320]  Reserve I asked him who receives the half trillion we're talking about 500
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:36.480]  billion dollars that the Federal Reserve handed over to foreign central banks who
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:41.120]  did they disseminate that money to and he said I don't know half a trillion
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:45.120]  dollars and he doesn't know it's long overdue we need to audit the Federal
[1:48:45.120 --> 1:48:48.960]  Reserve and I'm happy to say that that's we're gonna have a hearing on that very
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:54.640]  soon thank you gentlemen's time is expired what's amazing though is whenever
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:59.200]  you read the headlines of Bloomberg sues to find out where two trillion went
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:03.680]  that's a lawsuit that's been going on for 10 months since the banker bailout of
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:08.800]  11 months ago they're still arguing and asking where the first 500 million went
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:13.600]  to European banks it's over 4 trillion we know of the European banks alone out of
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:20.320]  the US and then I'm two months behind we're set here to learn the latest it
[1:49:20.320 --> 1:49:25.520]  was 23.7 trill it'll probably be right at 28 trill or above it when we get the
[1:49:25.520 --> 1:49:32.320]  next numbers at the one-year anniversary October 3rd right around that time
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:37.440]  they're set to release the last two months numbers and I'm guessing it'll be
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:42.800]  above 28 trill 28 trillion and I know I talk about this every day and I
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:48.400]  apologize but ladies and gentlemen those little bastards over at acorn
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:53.440]  wanting to you know get eight billion dollars to go around poverty pimping and
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:58.440]  steal most of it for big foundations I mean that's that's a serious issue but
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:04.640]  it's nothing compared to the 23.7 trillion but see you need to ask glen back
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:08.640]  and Sean Hannity why they won't talk about that oh cuz George Bush helped
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:12.560]  initiate that under orders of Geithner who's now the Treasury Secretary there
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:19.360]  is no difference these guys swap spit have drinks together it's a joke and I
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:23.680]  know I keep repeating that but and listen I know you know that but if your
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:30.280]  neighbors don't know and your friends and family don't know that Barack Obama
[1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:34.240]  doesn't care about him and that Sean Hannity doesn't care about him you you
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:37.720]  need to slap him upside the head because we don't have time to screw around
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:41.680]  anymore ladies and gentlemen if you're not calling for abolishing the Fed and
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:44.800]  auditing the Fed and if you're not talking about the New World Order and
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:48.600]  if you're not talking about dying corn halibut and running child kidnapping
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:53.440]  rings and if you're not talking about the sciences are talking about how he

[1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:39.320]  we're going to be simulcasting
[1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:48.320]  at prisonplanet.tv coming up in the third and fourth hour today
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:55:01.320]  continuing with news here is a clip of jimmy carter jimmy carter saying it's racism to not like the president and that's what the tea parties are about
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:07.320]  see we don't want government run health care we don't want open borders we don't want another banker bailout takeover bill
[1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:14.320]  we don't want the animal ID premise society to take over the farms and ranches and they have you in the contract sign your land over
[1:55:14.320 --> 1:55:27.320]  it's like an easement you wave your rights we don't want to be slaves we don't like Obama lying to us about everything we are racist and this is invoking racism
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:39.320]  this is creating racism this is creating division this is making people think about race this is dividing people and this is what the big city liberal machine does
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:44.320]  they race pimp here we go
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:56:12.320]  against what he has seen emerging in some of the public protests against president Obama we were in Atlanta to interview president Carter at the Carter center for air at a later date in connection with his upcoming 85th birthday during the interview we talked about what some see as a heightened climate of racial and other hate speech since the election of president Obama a certain number of signs and images at last weekend's big tea party march on Washington
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:14.320]  that's enough
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:30.320]  see analyzing this propaganda piece for going to his clip in a moment they said protest and other hate speech and see they have the bill passed the house that says if the government decides that what you've done could hurt somebody's feelings you get arrested
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:48.320]  or if for seven years after you make a statement somebody else decides to engage in violence you get arrested and the cyber bullying act says if you hurt somebody's feelings you get arrested these guys are communist commissars
[1:56:48.320 --> 1:56:54.320]  so this is the type of bizarre behavior here here is his statement
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:57:14.320]  I think a overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward president Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man that he's African-American
[1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:28.320]  I live in the south and I've seen the south come a long way and I've seen the rest of the country that shared the south's attitude toward minority groups at that time particularly African-Americans
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:48.320]  that racism inclination still exists and I think it's bubbled up to the surface because of a belief among many white people not just in the south but around the country that African-Americans are not qualified
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:58:06.320]  no one's saying Obama isn't smart or slick we're saying he's a liar but see instead of debating our first amendment and our right to demonstrate against what he's doing oh it's racism now
[1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:14.320]  it's hate speech did you hear him the vast portion the vast majority are racist
[1:58:14.320 --> 1:58:28.320]  just like the New York newspapers particularly the village voice came out and said yeah we showed Bush as a vampire and the Joker that's okay but you can't show Obama
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:42.320]  again they don't have a leg to stand on so they're clinging to race and they're totally discrediting themselves go ahead try to play your race card with your weird liberal poverty pimp cult
[1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:50.320]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today
[1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:56.320]  hello friends this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question do you really know what's in your tap water
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:59:05.320]  in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:13.320]  many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental system diseases now what are you going to do about it
[1:59:13.320 --> 1:59:19.320]  the Akola blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your families drinking water
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:30.320]  the Akola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques
[1:59:30.320 --> 1:59:38.320]  that's right clean water right from the air you breathe ordered today by calling 1-800-691-6043

[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:53.320]  we'll be simulcasting coming up at the eight after break at prismplanet.tv we're going to have open phones with Robert Galen Ross author researcher coming up in the rest of this hour a little bit in the next hour
[2:00:53.320 --> 2:01:02.320]  and I will continue with the news blitz that I've only gotten started on right now let's go back to the calls Stephen in Texas you're on the air
[2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:13.320]  yeah good afternoon Alex I'm okay couple things first of all you earlier mentioned about how without a fear monitoring the new order does to the media you think there was a terrorist behind every bush
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:22.320]  I wanted to reverse that which would make it true behind every terrorist there's a bush
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:26.320]  absolutely behind every bush there's a terrorist yes I've heard that one before
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:33.320]  yeah behind every book terrorist there is a bush and of course I'm referring to the bush family
[2:01:33.320 --> 2:01:48.320]  secondly I was wanting to find out did you get the I had emailed you to Rob and Aaron a book that I got through a newsletter I get from Dr. Joseph McCall out of Illinois
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:02:01.320]  it's called horrors of vaccination exposed and illustrated and I was wondering if you had a chance to look that over yet it was published in 1920 by Charles M Higgins
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:11.320]  yes and I appreciate your call I was sent that book and I've been meaning to scan over it and put a link to it up on info wars dot com thank you Steve
[2:02:11.320 --> 2:02:20.320]  we're also working on getting Dr. Marcola on he's been on in the past I want to get him back on the show to get his expertise on what's happening with the flu
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:25.320]  let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Montreal Brian you're on the air
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:31.320]  hi Alex it's Brian from 12 160 just wanted to say hi have a nice afternoon
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:42.320]  the two statements I'd like to make up here in Canada they're trying to push through bill C6 which will be a bill that will give them the right to come into anybody's house
[2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:50.320]  they're passing it as a consumer protection law but it's one of these laws where if Health Canada thinks that there's something in your apartment
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:57.320]  they'll be able to go through your neighbor's apartment without his permission to come into your house they'll be able to seize your goods they won't
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:03:08.320]  yes they're they're getting rid of Magna Carta and any free speech any rights any property rights in England in the US in Canada under the guise of the environment
[2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:22.320]  they're also passing laws all over the west to forcibly go into your home for quarantines and states are passing different laws they now take your blood in a whole bunch of different states here in the US without warrants
[2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  they just say hey we don't need any stinking warrants is to keep you safe they've got face scanning and license plate reading camera systems going in everywhere
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:40.320]  the government is a cancer it knows we're going to resist being raped and so it's gearing up to tie us down and hold us down while it does its business
[2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:53.320]  homeland security is the handcuffs that they use to handcuff us down to the bed when they rape us with the battery acid just like they do at Abergrahe children
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:55.320]  anything else Brian
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:04:10.320]  yeah I I called CBC radio news to talk to them about it why they are not covering any of the important things that we're covering and that reporter basically told me since I told him that we get most of our information from the internet
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:21.320]  and that we do the work ourselves of exposing the truth to other people this reporter basically told me I might as well keep doing that because CBC certainly isn't going to
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:34.320]  basically tells all of us continue being your own reporter continue doing your own investigation do not rely on any major media to do it for you because they're not going to
[2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:46.320]  very very interesting sir sounds like part of the course of these people because a lot of folks just want to go home watch pornography get drunk take drugs watch TV
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:51.320]  and they're also selfish that they end up losing their entire life their entire history
[2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:53.320]  because of it

[2:10:45.320 --> 2:11:01.320]  while active in engineering he was licensed professional engineer the state of texas and national certified manufacturing engineer after graduation except for the commission of the second lieutenant later promoted first lieutenant army security agency a branch of the nsa which is a big brother of the central intelligence
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:17.320]  agency military training was in the field of crypto analysis the breaking of codes and he served as a company commander with the intelligence unit on the demilitarized zone DMZ in the valley of south korea from fifty six fifty seven after fighting

[2:11:50.320 --> 2:12:04.320]  and four r i e dot com is the website robert galin ross great to have you here in studio with us it's fantastic having you here with us as well okay just in a nutshell
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:20.320]  let's talk about how the banking system works fiat banking some of your books cover that we carry them at info wars dot com kind of dovetail it with your other work the murder of jfk rfk mlk how they murder people we've had four big ceo's killed the last forty eight hours the
[2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:35.320]  head of the rockefeller families corporation was clearly murdered and then what their master plan is if they're able to bankrupt the planet and bring the system in either truly able to be successful we know world
[2:12:35.320 --> 2:12:54.320]  governments just the beginning what will look like if they were able to get everything they wanted so good to have you here with us i appreciate that what their goal is is to create the new order or the global union and the once they do that it'll be
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:13:11.320]  sort of like in the medieval time when the kings would live in their castles and in order to visit their friends in the other castle they'd have to have an army to escort them to the next castle because the peasants were out to get them
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:33.320]  and we're gonna end up with the kings and poppers all around the world and there won't be any middle class people there they're gonna eliminate the middle class but in order to stop this i've been in my book i have set up a timeline for stopping them
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:48.320]  and the first thing is we need to correct our voting system we all know that our voting system is corrupt and so once we straighten that out and the only way to do that is to go to a paper ballot
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:14:07.320]  counted by members of the local community and once the count is made then it must be posted in local newspaper before it ever goes to Washington or wherever so that they can't juggle the numbers once it was all finished
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:21.320]  and we've got you for over an hour so i want to get into that in the second part get into solutions get into your new book hot off the presses what the elite have done to America and how to fix it by Robert Galen Ross senior
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:30.320]  but starting out because we have a lot of people a lot of new listeners every day now the show just gets bigger and bigger thank God we're reaching more people because so much what we talked about has come through
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:46.320]  describe how fractional reserve banking works the Rockefellers the Rothschilds what we're dealing with and then currently your take on because you're right the club of romans brags CFR Braggs they want to bring in neo feudalism
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:15:02.320]  they want to bankrupt the world they want to go to a post industrial system where the armored government compounds in the countryside are where the elites live they will have life extension technologies they will have access to high tech we are going to be put into a level of
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:18.320]  squalor degradation one child policies really kind of roving government systems that keep us in check in the orderly extermination but but but specifically how these banking families got their control and what their master plan is
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:38.320]  you know they've developed techniques in their money science for example the the reserve system a bank is required to keep 10% of the capital in reserve and then they can loan out 90% so let's say that you deposit $1000 in local bank
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:58.320]  they can turn around and loan out $900 of that to someone else and let's say they loan it to Joe and Joe immediately puts into his checking account or savings account then they can loan out 90% of that so as this keeps going from one to another
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:14.320]  $1000 can create $9000 in new money and that's the fractal reserve system and it's done to so that they can loan this money out at interest
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:29.320]  continue breaking that down for people I mean in layman's terms they get the license from the government the authorization to just be able to make up money make up liquidity and then they buy up their own assets they buy up products in the industries
[2:16:29.320 --> 2:16:46.320]  and then they got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act of 99 that allowed investment banks to become normal retail banks and so they just directly gave themselves unlimited money and broke free of the chains of just the fractional reserve banking that already allowed them to take over the economy to just unlimited
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:55.320]  unlimited funding and so they've now created tens of trillions of dollars more fiat currency than there even is real assets
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:17:14.320]  that's correct and the Federal Reserve creates money out of thin air and most of the money they create is done by electronic means by just a computer entry into their database and if they print new money it costs somewhere around $35,000 for a
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:28.320]  pallet load of say $100 bills that's all it costs them but that pallet load may contain $5 billion worth of money so that the cost of printing the money is nothing to them.
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:31.320]  I've talked to economists because they haven't published these in about a decade.
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:50.320]  A decade ago for every billion dollars of fiat currency on the computer books well there's roughly 3% paper money or coin money for every dollar that's out there but I've been told it's even less than that down to about 1% right now so it's not just the
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:18:02.320]  print money it's just all this fiat made up money.
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:16.320]  So people will kill each other people will cheat their parents people will do anything for some Federal Reserve notes and it's all just made out of nothing for a handful of private families to be able to literally own the planet.
[2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:32.320]  That's right and then you have somebody like Bernie Madoff that he really soaked his own friends he took all their money and said he was going to invest it and it turned out he didn't invest any of it and it was a Ponzi scheme where he
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:46.320]  paid the dividends of his customers off the money of other people and he got up something like $65 billion he loaned out and of course now he's spent 150 years in prison for doing that.
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:57.320]  Well and he created the NASDAQ I mean this is one of the high level guys and it's been reported that the same stuff he's doing that all these major firms do this.
[2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:16.320]  But if you look at the derivatives and credit default swaps that is a Ponzi scheme in itself and in my book I give the amount of derivatives and credit default swaps that each bank owns the largest ones.
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:31.320]  Webster Tarpley says it's 1.5 quadrillion is that accurate? That's total derivatives yes. Now the banks don't have that they have about one-fiftieth of that in assets.
[2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:51.320]  For example JP Morgan Chase Bank has something real over $1 trillion in total capitalization and they've got 54 times that outstanding in derivatives so that's a Ponzi scheme.
[2:19:51.320 --> 2:19:59.320]  We've got a break let's come back and talk about what their master plan is because they're bragging they want a new bank of the world out of all this out of the crisis they created.
[2:19:59.320 --> 2:20:01.320]  And we'll talk about solutions with our guests.
[2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:40.320]  The freeze dry guy has been serving various government agencies as well as the private sector with the finest in freeze dried storable foods and emergency rations since 1970.
[2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:47.320]  Consider the technological advances made in computers from the punch car days of the 60s and 70s to the high speed personal computers of today.
[2:20:47.320 --> 2:21:01.320]  Rememberably the advances made in food storage from the World War II era till now are equally great. Visit the website at www.freezdryguy.com or call toll free 866-404-3663.
[2:21:17.320 --> 2:21:31.320]  Unfortunately with the Drug and Money Laundering Act the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933 some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[2:23:05.320 --> 2:23:13.320]  In the past owning a hidden video recorder has been expensive and too much of a bother to carry. That was then. This is now.

[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:13.320]  Robert Galen Ross is our guest in studio. We'll be with us 20 minutes to the next hour. We're going to have open phones.
[2:24:13.320 --> 2:24:27.320]  Also, the mainstream media has chickened out. They're not responding to Charlie Sheen's challenge to a debate. They want to just sit up there and misrepresent what he said about 9-11.
[2:24:27.320 --> 2:24:39.320]  I got a pretty hot text message from Charlie earlier today. He is just sick and tired of these cowards. I was talking to the guys. They were saying TMZ covered Charlie going in to have dinner the other night with Buzz Aldrin.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:46.320]  Charlie called Jim and says, hey, one of my friends knows Buzz Aldrin. I'm going to dinner with him. And then Charlie goes to dinner and becomes a news item. That's something else.
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:51.320]  So maybe cue that up. Maybe after Galen leaves us, we'll play that if you can find it.
[2:24:51.320 --> 2:25:00.320]  What the elite have done to America and how to fix it. Robert Galen Ross, senior. This is a short segment, but long saver coming up. We'll get more into the book after that.
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:07.320]  But getting into the bankers. What makes them tick? What is their world plan? We know they're eugenicists. We know it's come out the White House.
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:17.320]  Science are, admits they want a cold world population, that they want a world government to carry that out. What will the planet look like if we're unable to stop these people?
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:42.320]  It'll just be less than 1% of the super wealthy and the rest of us will be pions from normal pions down to sub pions. And there'll be one money, one monetary system, one around the world, all controlled, probably out of Brussels.
[2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:53.320]  And the Rothschilds keep their money in Switzerland so that nobody can ever find out what they really have.
[2:25:53.320 --> 2:26:09.320]  And you notice that they've only been selectively taking the bank accounts of people with like a million bucks. They're taking the low level, nobody's money out of these offshore corporations when it's admitted the Rockefellers have more than 10,000 shell corporations just in the Bahamas and the Caymans alone.
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:25.320]  That's right. But no one touches the Rothschilds or the Rockefellers' money. No one will report on it. It's suicide to really get into any details on Rockefellers and Rothschilds.
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:41.320]  Well, it is suicide. I'm always reading about Rockefeller secretaries, Rockefeller CEOs. If somebody in a well company doesn't do what they're told, they commit suicide, shotgun in the back of the head. Rockefeller's company's CEO committed suicide. James McDonald shot himself in the head yesterday.
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:49.320]  Probably in the back of the head with a double barrel shotgun.
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:57.320]  Now they do that when some criminality comes out to say, oh, he did it. He's dead. Or this guy may have taken a little something for himself.
[2:26:57.320 --> 2:27:13.320]  Well, you never know. And you can't ever trust the news from the major news media. They lie. The elite owned or control all news media except radio, of course.
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:23.320]  Yeah, a few handful of radio shows and Internet, which Jay Rockefeller admits they want to shut down. Oh, yeah. And eventually they'll try to control the Internet.
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:35.320]  And the Internet is one and talk radio is our last sources of real facts about what's going on in the world. And they'll naturally have to shut all that down.
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:44.320]  Yeah, the White House diversities are at the FCC said we need to look at what Hugo Chavez has done with his media fairness.
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:50.320]  Right. And Chavez, I mean, I'm glad he defeated that, you know, the expansion of North American Free Trade of America's area.
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:58.320]  I mean, I'm glad he helped shoot down the free trade area of the Americas. But now they're creating a socialist model of that.
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:02.320]  And Chavez is shutting down free speech in Venezuela.
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:12.320]  Well, yeah. But if you look at the net effect of Chavez, he has stopped the creation of the American Union single handedly.
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:14.320]  So you like Chavez?
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:21.320]  Well, I like most of what he does because he is he's trying to get in the way of the creation of the global union.
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:36.320]  And he's been very successful in all of South America. And people wonder why he associates with Gaddafi and I'm a mean inside and some of the others.
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:43.320]  Well, that's the only people out there available that will talk to him. So why not?
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:51.320]  Well, I mean, Gaddafi was the big boogeyman, but now he's a darling of the West. So they do the same thing. Saddam's our buddy one day.
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:55.320]  He's evil the next bin Laden's a hero one day. Next day he attacked us.
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:02.320]  So I mean, certainly I just really do see him clamping down on the media and free speech and trying to stay in power.
[2:29:02.320 --> 2:29:07.320]  And I mean, I see him as another Fidel Castro, but I do like what he did to the free trade area of the Americas.
[2:29:07.320 --> 2:29:09.320]  I mean, he did help kill that.
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:25.320]  And he also set up the Bank of the South, which is the central bank of all of South America, owned by the South American nations funded by Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.
[2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:35.320]  And they loan money to other nations of Latin America at very low interest rates so they can pay off their loans to the IMF and the World Bank.
[2:29:35.320 --> 2:29:45.320]  And they do charge 30% compounded. That's right. But let's finish up with with with Chavez fractional reserve banking, the elite master plan and then how to fix it.
[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:51.320]  From your perspective, Robert Galen Ross, author, researcher is our guest in studio.
[2:29:51.320 --> 2:30:01.320]  We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:07.320]  This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:07.320 --> 2:30:15.320]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:15.320 --> 2:30:21.320]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:21.320 --> 2:30:23.320]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[2:30:23.320 --> 2:30:41.320]  The Acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water. The Acola blue 28 produces up to seven gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state of the art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra violent light sterilization techniques.

[2:31:01.320 --> 2:31:15.320]  Acola blue is created by the power elite, is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center? Buying their processed food that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[2:33:12.320 --> 2:33:38.320]  But we have allowed private interest to take control of our banking system and our government. And they have looted and robbed us blind. They have set up a world government to take over other nations using our funds and capital.
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:50.320]  They have used our name and our flag as their banner of all of their evil actions. And now we're hated the world over. They put in this Hollywood president to try to fool people.
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:34:08.320]  Robert Galen Ross, Barack Obama, giving your take on him and whether or not you think this is it, are they really getting ready to kill the dollar. All these big announcements from top economists how the dollar is going to die. We're going to be like Argentina trying to destroy confidence, trying to drive us into accepting.
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:22.320]  Oh, the bankers will fix it if you just do what they say. They've got a global government, a global carbon tax. All the stuff we got laughed at for over the decades is now just all openly being announced.
[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:39.320]  Well, I've got a chapter on what I call elite spies within our government. And Obama is surrounded by members of the elite, just like ever president since Wilson, all of his top advisors or members of the Bilderbergs Council for Relation Trilateral Commission.
[2:34:39.320 --> 2:35:01.320]  So nothing's really going to change in the creation of the New York Order or the Global Union. And he's certainly a very articulate, intelligent person. But I don't think you ever get into that position unless you sell your soul to Lucifer.
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:11.320]  And it's so simple and people get caught up and in four years when they put a Republican in, we're going to have to argue with these idiots that hey, this is another puppet.
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:16.320]  What's your take on what's developing with the dollar from your research?
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:35.320]  Well, I've got a graph in my book that shows the effects of money supply and for all the last 30, 40 years, it's been fairly flat, the M3 money supply. And in the last year, it's going up something like 200%.
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:58.320]  And so when the money supply goes up, that means that we're into hyperinflation. We'll be like Zimbabwe in Argentina. Zimbabwe, you have to take a web bar full of money to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread.
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:15.320]  We're going to end up in that same road. Right now, our largest paper dollar or paper bill is $100 bill. Within two or three years, it could be a $10,000 bill. That's what happened to Argentina and to Zimbabwe.
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:29.320]  And the establishment knows all of this is going to be rolled out in phases. That's why they openly admit Northcom and Homeland Security and the Patriot Act is for the Anti-Federal Reserve protesters, for the veterans, for the gun owners.
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:38.320]  And so again, they built this thing in the name of fighting al-Qaeda, but the whole time it was meant for us because they know we're not going to like becoming third world slaves.
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:53.320]  Now, I saw a piece on my computer a couple of weeks ago about a British general that the reporter asked him how many al-Qaeda have y'all killed. He says zero.
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:37:10.320]  He says how many al-Qaeda are trying to put us under? And he says zero. There is no such thing as al-Qaeda. That's the term that they invented to create something to fight. Now, there are Taliban and...
[2:37:10.320 --> 2:37:19.320]  By the way, the Pentagon admits that. They say it was the name of the computer program in 79 to recruit and name all the Mujahideen working for the CIA.
[2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:29.320]  Right. And we would create all that problem as Afghanistan to try to run the Russians out. And then when we finally got the Russians out, then these people turned on us.
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:42.320]  There's been a 13-fold now it grows of any record of opium production. Heroin is everywhere now. And the BBC just admits, well, the U.S. and the British, we have to guard the opium or the Taliban will get it.
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:49.320]  The Taliban is there guarding it. We're shipping it out. I mean, was it over oil or was it more over opium?
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:38:06.320]  It was over two reasons. Afghanistan for two reasons. Number one, they needed to create a 48-inch gas pipeline and oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea area down to Saltwater Port South and also into China.
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:24.320]  And these had to go through Afghanistan. And the Taliban would not permit it. And then the second reason is the 90% of the opium in the world is accreted there in Afghanistan.
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:42.320]  And the Taliban, it's against their religion for their own people to consume it. And so the production of poppies was outlawed by the Taliban and was hated to zero about the time we invaded Afghanistan.
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:45.320]  And from there on, it went back up to normal production.
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:39:04.320]  But just to be driving in my car, listening to XM a few months ago, I already knew all this, but to hear them admit it, BBC spun it like, well, U.S. and British forces guard the poppies and production has gone up because if we don't let the farmers grow it, the Taliban will take back control and they will sell it.
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:14.320]  And that's always the rationale. That's how the CIA got involved in narcotics when it was OSS. Well, if we don't, the Nazis will do it. And no, the truth is, it's just the mafia.
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:26.320]  The Taliban is actually a mafia within Afghanistan and they go around and control the farmers and everything they do is controlled by the Taliban.
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:32.320]  Got me wanting to cough now, too. We're having like a, it's funny, one person coughs, the other feels like they've got to cough.
[2:39:32.320 --> 2:39:34.320]  It's just like a yawn.
[2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:46.320]  Absolutely. Hey, it would be nice to take a little snooze right now. We could just say nap time now and play, play some, play some nice, nice soft music for people.
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:58.320]  Robert, let's get into the master plan a little bit more and then into solutions. Okay, studying this. What makes the globalist tick? Why do they enjoy doing horrible things to people?
[2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:04.320]  Why do they enjoy pushing eugenics and what will the world look like if they're successful?
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:17.320]  Well, you're a great example. You've presented a great example of what they're like. You snuck into the Bohemian Grove and you've videoed the ceremony.
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:32.320]  You've got some people that are involved in medieval thoughts and this is done every day in their operations. They just happened to meet there at Bohemian Grove.
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:47.320]  And also, I was really proud of you when you approached David Gergen and he says he dishonors you or something like that.
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:52.320]  He got mad, yeah. But it takes people like you.
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:59.320]  Well, somebody had to do it. But the thing was, I didn't really believe they were doing that completely when I snuck in. I snuck in to see.
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:09.320]  And then I was sitting there watching the ritual and I thought, well, this maybe is like a play. But the old men around me were very agitated, breathing heavy.
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:19.320]  This was more religious than going to Baptist church growing up and holy rollers getting really excited and praying and getting wild.
[2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:26.320]  This was religious rapture. I mean, they were really into this at certain points.
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:30.320]  And as a formal ceremony, that was not a stage show.
[2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:38.320]  And that's just a micro example of what's going on throughout the world.
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:48.320]  And these people get involved in trafficking of drugs, trafficking of young children, trafficking of women throughout the world.
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:53.320]  And it even comes out in Congress and Rumsfeld says they're not going to get in trouble. We're going to let Dinecore do it.
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:58.320]  And then anywhere you walk into an acorn, you go, I got 12-year-old sex slaves and they go, great.
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:01.320]  I mean, that's how mainstream this is.
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:08.320]  Yeah. And that was another great expose there where they snuck in or just walked in pretending to be a prostitute in a pail.
[2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:15.320]  I've always told my listeners, get hidden cameras, go into any city council, any government group, any CPS.
[2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:18.320]  And these people are so lawless and so criminal.
[2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:23.320]  I mean, look, if you can steal kids with no due process all day, there's going to be something wrong with you.
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:24.320]  That's right.
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:30.320]  And I'm telling you, the few times I go to the Capitol, I catch bribery on tape, the government is so corrupt.
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:36.320]  It's like a rotten barn. You pull one plank off, there's termites anywhere you look.
[2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:42.320]  That's right. And they try to keep it under wraps.
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:52.320]  But every now and then it'll come out. But then they put a spin on it saying, well, no, that must be fiction.
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:56.320]  That doesn't really happen. That's not us. But we know it is.
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:42:59.320]  Well, you've studied societies, how they go into these cycles.
[2:42:59.320 --> 2:43:02.320]  We're clearly going into a very decadent cycle.
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:09.320]  Can you describe what you from your deep research and the other experts you talked to in an interview for your book believe is going to happen?
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:14.320]  A and B get into what's happening with the dollar.
[2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:23.320]  Okay. First of all, the creation of the American Union was scheduled for January 1st, 2005.
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:32.320]  And Dick Cheney said that in a video that I have and where Dave Rockville congratulated him for his talk.
[2:43:32.320 --> 2:43:41.320]  He said we were on track to create the American Union or they call it the Council of the Americas by January 1st, 2005.
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:44.320]  He really meant the American Union.
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:47.320]  And by the way, on that same clip, he's so arrogant.
[2:43:47.320 --> 2:43:51.320]  He goes, I didn't tell my constituents I was doing this and they all laugh at us.
[2:43:51.320 --> 2:43:58.320]  It's real funny that he can do this on C-SPAN knowing his constituents in Wyoming aren't watching C-SPAN.
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:43:59.320]  That's right.
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:03.320]  I mean, every meeting I watch of these guys now, they laugh at us. It's funny.
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:08.320]  But they have been planning this.
[2:44:08.320 --> 2:44:19.320]  In fact, I've got the minutes of the first Bilderberg meeting in which David Rockfellow talked about the world economy at that first Bilderberg meeting in 1954.
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:23.320]  And the planning of the creation of the European Union.
[2:44:23.320 --> 2:44:31.320]  And so they have very long range plans that they don't do what's going to happen this quarter or this month.
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:36.320]  If it slips a little bit, well, we'll do it next year or next five years.
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:38.320]  Long term strategic plan.
[2:44:38.320 --> 2:44:39.320]  That's right.
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:43.320]  And it's like the frog in the pan as you gradually turn the heat up.
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:46.320]  The frog is cooked before he knows about it.
[2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:48.320]  And they're doing that to the public.
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:58.320]  And I know that if they are too aggressive that people will fall out in the streets by the millions and maybe bring out some guillotines.
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:06.320]  But they're now rolling out the sound cannons and the microwave guns at the end, the Fed rallies.
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:25.320]  Well, the Patriotic Act and several other things that they continually try to take our freedoms away from us and try to make us all seem as though we're evil people.
[2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:36.320]  We're a terrorist and I think you probably have talked about the famous saying that they've got a list of people that are terrorists.
[2:45:36.320 --> 2:45:37.320]  Yes.
[2:45:37.320 --> 2:45:40.320]  Or sympathizers and we've all got to be put in camps.
[2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:43.320]  And so you and I are probably deep on that list.
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:45.320]  And so.
[2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:49.320]  Oh yeah, they won't give me my four year for my FBI file.
[2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:51.320]  It says national security.
[2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:56.320]  And then national security, I can't see what lies they've gotten there about me.
[2:45:56.320 --> 2:46:01.320]  Well, legally, you should be able to go to the FBI and see your records.
[2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:02.320]  Exactly.
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:05.320]  I've talked to a lawyer where I'm going to have to sue him.
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:13.320]  But there's all sorts of garbage in there and you and I have very thick files in the CIA and the FBI.
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:15.320]  Oh, of course, they study what we're doing.
[2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:19.320]  I've noticed Glenn Beck and others are now copying all the terms I use.
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:23.320]  Like we've got to stop the fall of the Republic, the New World Order.
[2:46:23.320 --> 2:46:29.320]  But then he they're doing that so he can be in control of the opposition and lead them and control them.
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:30.320]  Right.
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:36.320]  And they have these stooges out there to try to drive us in one direction or another.
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:40.320]  And they try to appear to be one thing, but they're really the other.
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:43.320]  Robert, again, back to the dollar.
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:45.320]  We were talking during a break.
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:49.320]  Do you think this is the rush to the exits?
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:52.320]  Do you think this is the beginning of the death of the dollar?
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:59.320]  There's no question about it until you'll end up with the international monetary system.
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:01.320]  I don't know what they'll call it.
[2:47:01.320 --> 2:47:06.320]  And in the European Union, they call it the Euro.
[2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:11.320]  And I believe Africa, they call it Afro or something like this.
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:16.320]  But they will create one money system.
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:21.320]  And so and it all be created electronically.
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:28.320]  And so if you are not within their system, you won't be able to spend money.
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:37.320]  And eventually they will try to go to implants so that if you don't have an implant and then you can't spend money.
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:40.320]  Well, that's what Rockefeller told Aaron Russo.
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:45.320]  And he said, our license plates, our chips, everything, we're going to be above the law.
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:47.320]  All of you are going to be slaves.
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:52.320]  And that's actually what they're implementing now, where they're reading our license plates in real time everywhere.
[2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:54.320]  They're tracking everything we do.
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:47:56.320]  This is outrageous.
[2:47:56.320 --> 2:48:05.320]  And on the streets and London, there are thousands of cameras all over London and they're doing it here.
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:10.320]  They say that they're putting them on the freeway so that it can control traffic.
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:12.320]  It's also so they can tell where you're going.
[2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:24.320]  Well, they admit that now, but I actually have an article here in my stack from today where, oh, look, how China's yawn can become the new global currency.
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:25.320]  There's one article.
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:26.320]  But look at this.
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:28.320]  Cameras keep track of all cars entering Medina.
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:36.320]  City signs have a unique way of greeting people. For instance, motorists are told they're entering a special place where people care.
[2:48:36.320 --> 2:48:46.320]  And they go zoned to say the cameras have recently been installed in intersections to monitor every vehicle coming into the city under the automatic license plate recognition project.
[2:48:46.320 --> 2:48:50.320]  Once a car enters the town, a camera captures its license plate number.
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:52.320]  Within seconds, the number is run through the database.
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:58.320]  And I noticed 10 years ago, they announced this in Florida and a few other towns in Texas. I've seen the federal orders.
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:03.320]  Every state in the union for at least seven years, everything you do is tracked.
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:05.320]  Everywhere you go is tracked.
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:10.320]  And they can read hundreds of plates a second and it has nothing to do with stopping crime.
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:12.320]  You notice they never use it for crime.
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:14.320]  This is a Homeland Security grid.
[2:49:14.320 --> 2:49:28.320]  And if you don't think they can do it, you'll see some of these intersections where they have a camera and anyone that runs a red light, within a week or so, they'll get a ticket.
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:35.320]  Because they have the ability to read the license plate and go in their database and know exactly who you are.
[2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:36.320]  That's right.
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:39.320]  Like out in California, I see the old big flash bulbs that go off.
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:40.320]  They don't need that anymore.
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:44.320]  They don't need the flashing systems at night to take a photo of your car.
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:45.320]  Now it's license plate reading.
[2:49:45.320 --> 2:49:47.320]  And then here's another one, News 10.
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:51.320]  Sheriff's Department responds to Sonic device outrage.
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:50:00.320]  The San Diego County Sheriff Department Tuesday responded to News 10's report that a new Sonic weapon known as Long Range Acoustic Device L ran.
[2:50:00.320 --> 2:50:04.320]  The technology has been used to control crowds in Iraq and control insurgents.
[2:50:04.320 --> 2:50:10.320]  And it's now in the Sheriff's Department's possession being used at the Tea Party rallies.
[2:50:10.320 --> 2:50:13.320]  So again, they've militarized the police.
[2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:16.320]  They're training them to go after the people.
[2:50:16.320 --> 2:50:22.320]  And all of this was set up before the big banks try to bring us into this economic implosion.
[2:50:22.320 --> 2:50:23.320]  That's right.
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:38.320]  I've seen that sound system on the military channel where one of the reporters got within range of that and all of a sudden they turned it on and he just ran away because he says it's so painful.
[2:50:38.320 --> 2:50:42.320]  Well, these are also soft kill weapon trainers.
[2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:51.320]  The studies show if they shoot you with a sound beam and microwave rubber bullets that they're more apt next time to fire real bullets when they're ordered to.
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:56.320]  So it's just like you train an attack dog on dummies first before you give him real blood.
[2:50:56.320 --> 2:50:59.320]  We back in one minute to talk about solutions.
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:22.320]  Airandaqua.com is your one stop shop for some of the most affordable air and water purification systems available on the market today.

[2:52:04.320 --> 2:52:10.320]  This year, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[2:52:10.320 --> 2:52:18.320]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[2:52:18.320 --> 2:52:26.320]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[2:52:26.320 --> 2:52:37.320]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much, much more.
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:43.320]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:52:43.320 --> 2:52:48.320]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[2:53:18.320 --> 2:53:22.320]  The most effective way of detoxifying can easily remove heavy metals and contaminants.
[2:53:22.320 --> 2:53:30.320]  Studies show that liquid zeolite captures triggering antigens which cause allergies, migraines, and asthma, decreasing the rate and severity of these symptoms.
[2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:39.320]  Liquid zeolite is a tasteless and odorless liquid that when taken daily, supports a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle in an increasingly toxic world.
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:46.320]  And liquid zeolite is so gentle that you won't even know you're taking it. Although your list of elements may be endless, the solution is simple.
[2:53:46.320 --> 2:54:00.320]  Get your liquid zeolite for yourself by visiting restoreyourhealthnow.com, that's restoreyourhealthnow.com, or call 1-800-976-0025, that's 1-800-976-0025 today.
[2:54:00.320 --> 2:54:25.320]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to start taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 on this live Wednesday, September 16, 2009 edition.
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:30.320]  After Mr. Ross leaves us in about 30 minutes, I'm going to do a big news blitz and more of your phone calls.
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:35.320]  So I said I'd start the show with this flu news, and I haven't gotten to it yet, but I'm going to.
[2:54:35.320 --> 2:54:43.320]  Robert, you and your new book that isn't out yet, but will be out soon, you get into your ideas for solutions, monetizing the debt versus a gold standard.
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:49.320]  A lot of people are against the gold standard because the banks have hoarded all the gold, so they'd be back in control again.
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:57.320]  But I mean, don't we just start with auditing the Fed, don't we have to get rid of the Fed first, and I guess we also need to then, or nationalize the Fed?
[2:54:57.320 --> 2:55:03.320]  Well, first of all, none of this will happen, Alex, until we straighten it out in a timeline.
[2:55:03.320 --> 2:55:07.320]  The first thing we have to do is correct our voting system.
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:13.320]  It's so corrupt now that they can make anybody win an election.
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:26.320]  And so, first of all, we have to go to paper ballots everywhere, counted by local citizens, and posted in local newspapers before it's sent to Washington.
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:33.320]  And now once we have the voting system corrected, then we need to eliminate the two-party system.
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:41.320]  The two-party system, if the Democrats are in control, the Republicans fight everything they try to do.
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:45.320]  The Republicans are in control, the Democrats fight everything they try to do.
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:53.320]  So they should not be allowed to do anything to enhance or degrade a party for any reason.
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:56:03.320]  They ought to be there to do things for their constituents to improve the quality of life of their constituents, but they haven't done that probably ever.
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:16.320]  So, first of all, then if we have an every election, there should be as many independent people running for office as we can drive out of the bushes.
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:30.320]  And a great way would be to have 25% of Congress, one independent party, 25% another independent party, 25% Democrats, and 25% Republicans.
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:34.320]  That way they lose control.
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:47.320]  Even better than that is to have every elected representative and independent person so that they are not controlled by a party, that they're there to represent their constituents.
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:53.320]  We need to change the total election system.
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:57:07.320]  For example, we should limit the time of campaigning for presidential office to six months and to a member of Congress or the House of Representatives to three months,
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:22.320]  and then allow our demand that all local TV stations must provide an avenue for campaigning of everybody running for office.
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:37.320]  So, and if we don't do that, then nothing will change because we've got and when the election comes up, we need to vote against every incumbent except about six and I named those six in my book.
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:42.320]  And the reason that is we need to get their attention.
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:44.320]  Well, that's what politics is.
[2:57:44.320 --> 2:57:54.320]  I mean, you listen to a Sean Hannity or somebody, they sound great when their party's out of power, but as soon as the Republicans back in, they're going to support the whole new older agenda.
[2:57:54.320 --> 2:58:01.320]  Just like Democrats sound great when Bush is in power, but as soon as they get in power, they just continue because they're all bought and paid for.
[2:58:01.320 --> 2:58:11.320]  Can't we just bypass all that and arrest the Federal Reserve Board and arrest Rockefeller and Rothschilds and indict them for their crimes and just get our system back that way?
[2:58:11.320 --> 2:58:19.320]  If you can't do that until you get control of Congress and presidency, because.
[2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:20.320]  But how do we do that?
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:25.320]  Do we start at the local level because I see the local level as the area where we actually have power.
[2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:35.320]  Correct the voting system first, then have independent people run so that we get the control of the Democrats and Republicans out of Congress.
[2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:36.320]  Well, stay there.
[2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:37.320]  We got a break for one minute.
[2:58:37.320 --> 2:58:38.320]  We're going to come back with a final hour.
[2:58:38.320 --> 2:58:42.320]  Your phone calls on a lot more.
[2:58:42.320 --> 2:58:45.320]  You are listening to GCN.
[2:58:45.320 --> 2:58:50.320]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:50.320 --> 2:58:56.320]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:58:56.320 --> 2:59:00.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:59:00.320 --> 2:59:06.320]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:59:06.320 --> 2:59:11.320]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:17.320]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:59:17.320 --> 2:59:21.320]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:59:21.320 --> 2:59:25.320]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:59:25.320 --> 2:59:29.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:59:29.320 --> 2:59:35.320]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[2:59:35.320 --> 2:59:40.320]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:42.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:59:42.320 --> 3:00:10.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[3:00:10.320 --> 3:00:16.320]  Check in your phone calls from Robert Galen-Ross coming up in the next segment at 800-259-9231.
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:19.320]  But you're running through your new book that isn't even out yet.
[3:00:19.320 --> 3:00:21.320]  It'll be out what, the next month or so?
[3:00:21.320 --> 3:00:22.320]  Within two weeks.
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:26.320]  Within two weeks, so folks can get it then at your website that we've got up on screen.
[3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:29.320]  But continue with your idea of Solutions.
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:35.320]  Okay, after we correct the voting process and we eliminate the two-party system,
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:44.320]  then we have independent people within Congress that will do things for the constituents rather than for special interests.
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:48.320]  So then we need to attack the Federal Reserve system.
[3:00:48.320 --> 3:01:09.320]  There's an attorney out in California named Ellen Hodgson-Brown that did a research on the Federal Reserve and she says that if we nationalize the Federal Reserve,
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:22.320]  we can completely eliminate the income tax for everybody within the United States and she goes through every step along the way to prove that you can do that.
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:32.320]  Well, that certainly could have been done with the comprehensive financial report information that Walter Beering and others put out.
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:40.320]  The problem is they've now created this 1.5-quadrillion in fiat made up debt.
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:44.320]  But clearly for those that don't know, I love the point Ron Paul always makes.
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:50.320]  They will show the capital behind him when he's on Fox News or CNN and they'll say,
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:54.320]  well, you want to get rid of the income tax at Federal Reserve, how will we fund the government?
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:57.320]  And he says, well, we built this capital in the whole country without it.
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:01:58.320]  We didn't have it until 1913.
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:02.320]  The income tax wasn't more than a percentage point until the 1950s.
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:06.320]  Not one red cent of the Federal Reserve money goes around this country.
[3:02:06.320 --> 3:02:07.320]  That's right.
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:20.320]  But if you take the total interest earned by the Federal Reserve in a year and she goes back and uses the year 2005, for example,
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:28.320]  and she takes the total income tax paid and then the total interest earned by the Federal Reserve,
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:36.320]  and then if we eliminate the IRS, that's another $10 billion of cost that we eliminate.
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:45.320]  And then if we do some other things in following chapters,
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:53.320]  it'll turn out that instead of having a debt every year, we can probably have a $200 billion surplus.
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:58.320]  And it'll be forever because, and one of the chapters I talked about,
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:03.320]  the military to bring all military people back into continental United States.
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:05.320]  Yeah, none of these countries are starting wars.
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:08.320]  There's the regional groups can deal with themselves.
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:13.320]  That's why the globalists are always going in and stirring up and funding terror groups,
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:16.320]  funding armies, funding other countries, attack other nations,
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:19.320]  because you've got this multi-trillion-dollar-a-year business,
[3:03:19.320 --> 3:03:22.320]  weapons sales worldwide in armies, they've got to have a business.
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:24.320]  So they go out and start wars.
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:26.320]  But they start wars for the banks.
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:30.320]  The banks finance both sides of every war,
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:34.320]  and they finance the reconstruction of the countries destroyed in the wars.
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:40.320]  And so if we eliminate wars, think of the...
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:42.320]  They sell weapons systems to both sides.
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:45.320]  They finance both sides.
[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:47.320]  They own the military industrial complex.
[3:03:47.320 --> 3:03:49.320]  So they make money off of it.
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:57.320]  And so we've got to stop the money source of the elite.
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:04:06.320]  If you bring all the troops back, then we also need to create jobs in the United States.
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:14.320]  So the next step we need to do is have the president get out of the World Trade Organization,
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:18.320]  get out of the United Nations, get out of NAFTA, get out of CAFTA,
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:23.320]  and get out of all free trade agreements that have been signed in the past.
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:26.320]  They're all one-sided for the globalists to consolidate power.
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:31.320]  But then you tell all nations we will trade with you on an equal basis
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:38.320]  for every million dollars that we import, we're going to export a million dollars to you.
[3:04:38.320 --> 3:04:41.320]  I think there wouldn't have any choice.
[3:04:41.320 --> 3:04:43.320]  Yeah, they don't.
[3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:47.320]  But the globalists like to do sweetheart deals where it's not a level playing field.
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:52.320]  I want to ask you about Obama being the first president to be the head of the UN Security Council,
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:04:55.320]  which a lot of people point out in the Constitution as illegal.
[3:04:55.320 --> 3:05:00.320]  But it was also illegal for Cohen Powell to become a knight or George Bush Sr., but they did it.
[3:05:00.320 --> 3:05:01.320]  Stay with us.
[3:05:30.320 --> 3:05:31.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:06:00.320 --> 3:06:05.320]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[3:06:05.320 --> 3:06:10.320]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick,
[3:06:10.320 --> 3:06:12.320]  go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[3:06:12.320 --> 3:06:15.320]  You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[3:08:12.320 --> 3:08:17.320]  Dan in the Philippines, Manfred in Montana, David in Texas, Terry in Indiana, Jock in California.
[3:08:17.320 --> 3:08:20.320]  We're going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[3:08:20.320 --> 3:08:26.320]  We're about 15 minutes away from huge news blitzes, tons of key news I'm going to cover
[3:08:26.320 --> 3:08:31.320]  until the end of the show coming up on a host of issues starting in the next segment.
[3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:36.320]  The final segment with Robert Galin Ross time has really gone by fast with him.
[3:08:36.320 --> 3:08:39.320]  I want to go to your calls here in just a moment.
[3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:46.320]  But we were getting into Obama becoming the first president to be the head of the UN Security Council.
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:52.320]  No presidents have ever done that because the Constitution states they can't be part of other government bodies or boards
[3:08:52.320 --> 3:08:57.320]  and make decisions for the U.S. without Congress' approval.
[3:08:57.320 --> 3:09:01.320]  And it wasn't just us saying this is unprecedented.
[3:09:01.320 --> 3:09:08.320]  AP and Reuters in the last week had all these weird statements about sealing our new closeness with the UN
[3:09:08.320 --> 3:09:11.320]  and global governance and the new Bank of the World.
[3:09:11.320 --> 3:09:13.320]  I mean, this is really happening.
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:17.320]  There's no question about it. And that's part of their overall plan.
[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:20.320]  It's all very carefully orchestrated.
[3:09:20.320 --> 3:09:23.320]  And they think there's nothing we can do about it.
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:30.320]  But all you got to do is think about how many people showed up in Washington this last weekend.
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:33.320]  What they're being led by loyal opposition, and that's the plan,
[3:09:33.320 --> 3:09:39.320]  is to have a guy that supported the Banker bailout, a guy that supported the Patriot Act, Glenn Beck, lead them.
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:40.320]  That's the problem.
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:45.320]  We need to have someone leading the crowd that has no agenda except to...
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:48.320]  But it does show you're right. People are waking up.
[3:09:48.320 --> 3:09:56.320]  I mean, Greenspan's in the news today, Bloomberg whining, saying he thinks Congress is going to take the Fed over.
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:09:58.320]  So they're definitely not arrogant anymore, though.
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:01.320]  We're finally identifying who the real power structure are.
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:05.320]  That's right. And Ron Paul is exactly right.
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:10.320]  He's talking about auditing the Fed, but we really need to nationalize the Fed.
[3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:14.320]  Well, he says that if we can get the audit, then we can get the nationalization.
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:20.320]  He says they're so criminal, and he's called for criminal investigations here, that it's step one.
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:24.320]  It'll be hard to just abolish them up front, but the Fed has said,
[3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:27.320]  if you audit us, you might as well abolish us.
[3:10:27.320 --> 3:10:34.320]  Well, we really need something like the Fed in order to manage our money system within the United States.
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:36.320]  To certainly get out of it, yeah.
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:38.320]  But we need to own the Fed.
[3:10:38.320 --> 3:10:40.320]  And have it be transparent.
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:46.320]  That's right. And if we own it, then all the transparency and that sort of thing.
[3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:52.320]  Well, Paul's got a Von Mies degree, and he's a doctorate in economics and a medical doctor, and I respect him.
[3:10:52.320 --> 3:10:57.320]  And he likes sound money. And if we just stayed on silver and gold, they couldn't have done what they've done.
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:11:00.320]  But now we're in this global fiat system.
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:07.320]  The other models of using fiat to empower us, if it was done properly and openly, it could be a great system.
[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:13.320]  Yeah, but you'd have to really have a high value of gold if we, say, went to the gold standard.
[3:11:13.320 --> 3:11:18.320]  Because the federal debt is something between $75 and $100 trillion.
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:20.320]  So it had to be a million dollars an ounce.
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:23.320]  That's right. So there's not enough.
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:29.320]  If you use it at today's price, there's not enough gold out there to cover all the cash requirements.
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:33.320]  I don't think people realize the type of inflation we're talking about.
[3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:37.320]  Hyperinflation. Hyperinflation.
[3:11:37.320 --> 3:11:41.320]  Finish up real fast, running through a few more of your points, and let's take some calls.
[3:11:41.320 --> 3:11:45.320]  Another thing that we need to do is that we need to eliminate short selling.
[3:11:45.320 --> 3:11:47.320]  And short selling is...
[3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:48.320]  And naked short selling.
[3:11:48.320 --> 3:11:54.320]  Yeah, short selling is let's say that I borrow your car and sell it.
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:58.320]  And then later on, I buy it back at a lower price.
[3:11:58.320 --> 3:12:07.320]  Well, naked short selling is I can take your car and sell it without you knowing about it, without borrowing it.
[3:12:07.320 --> 3:12:11.320]  And then if anyone defaults, I say, that's too bad.
[3:12:11.320 --> 3:12:13.320]  In fact, you never even have the car.
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:14.320]  That's right.
[3:12:14.320 --> 3:12:17.320]  You just sold thin air to somebody.
[3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:18.320]  That's right.
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:27.320]  And also currency speculation has caused the economies of many nations to be crashed.
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:30.320]  George Soros is a major actor in this.
[3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:35.320]  And then he goes on TV and talks about how he's the savior trying to fix this.
[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:39.320]  But this is based on selling something you don't have.
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:41.320]  That's what shorting is.
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:51.320]  And so we need to outlaw shorting completely by saying that you cannot sell anything that you don't have legal documented right to.
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:56.320]  And of course, Wall Street would not want that because that's where they make other money.
[3:12:56.320 --> 3:13:13.320]  And let's be clear that they then just made made up derivatives, paper, credit default swaps and insurance certifications, use the money off that leveraged it 10 times, then went out and engaged in all these different manipulations of the stock market.
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:16.320]  This is just a complete group of con artist frauds.
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:17.320]  That's right.
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:24.320]  And the only way you can overcome that is completely nationalize the Federal Reserve and nationalize all federal banks.
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:25.320]  But here's the problem.
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:30.320]  The globalists are going to stage wars, stage nuke attacks, release bio weapons.
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:35.320]  They're going to try to use Northcom to block Galen Ross and Ron Paul and others from doing this.
[3:13:35.320 --> 3:13:39.320]  So do you educate the public about false flag terror?
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:40.320]  That's right.
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:41.320]  You have to.
[3:13:41.320 --> 3:13:45.320]  First of all, you got to do it with education because they're not going to just let us go do this.
[3:13:45.320 --> 3:13:47.320]  I mean, clearly we're marching.
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:48.320]  People are waking up.
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:51.320]  We have a chance to do this to dream as destiny.
[3:13:51.320 --> 3:13:55.320]  And I'm saying they're not they're not going to just sit back and let us do this.
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:57.320]  So what's your idea there?
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:14:05.320]  Well, that's one reason for this book is try to educate the people of what's really going behind going on behind the scenes.
[3:14:05.320 --> 3:14:12.320]  And once everybody understands what's going on, then instead of a million people marching on Washington, there might be five million.
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:13.320]  I agree with you.
[3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:20.320]  If the average cop has been given a microwave gun to attack peaceful protesters realizes his future is being destroyed to.
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:24.320]  Then there's a good chance that he's not going to go along with it.
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:25.320]  That's right.
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:36.320]  And if the law enforcement people have a copy of this book or similar information, then you're right when when they say, all right, let's go march on those people.
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:38.320]  Well, then they say, no, I don't think that's right.
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:39.320]  We're not going to do that.
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:42.320]  And then the officers might rebel.
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:46.320]  So we but but it has to all be based on education.
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:49.320]  Well, I mean, you're an engineer who worked with oil and things.
[3:14:49.320 --> 3:14:53.320]  I mean, they admit that sodium fluoride in the water brain damages people.
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:56.320]  They admit the Germans put it in people's water than the Soviets did.
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:15:02.320]  I mean, I mean, when we tell cops don't drink the water, I mean, this is an evil elite.
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:04.320]  That's right.
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:07.320]  Tell folks what sodium fluoride does to your brain.
[3:15:07.320 --> 3:15:21.320]  Sodium fluoride is a is a is a chemical that the Russians and the South Africans and the Israelis used to to make their people docile.
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:25.320]  And it's in a toothpaste.
[3:15:25.320 --> 3:15:26.320]  It's in water.
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:29.320]  And by the way, on record, they admit they do this.
[3:15:29.320 --> 3:15:30.320]  I mean, this is not our opinion.
[3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:31.320]  That's right.
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:36.320]  And and if you read the label on a toothpaste box, it says if you swallow.
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:42.320]  More than a little bit of this immediately go to the poison control center because it's a it's a known poison.
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:46.320]  But I mean, I just bring that up of they're poisoning our water.
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:48.320]  Well, why are we even here debating this with each other?
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:49.320]  That's right.
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:56.320]  I mean, I mean, I'm asking FBI agents and others, did you get a memo telling you not to drink the water?
[3:15:56.320 --> 3:15:58.320]  No, you're in the same boat with us.
[3:15:58.320 --> 3:16:01.320]  And that's why I realized not to just get mad and attack them.
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:04.320]  Whether you know it or not, we're in the same boat together.
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:06.320]  That's right. This is ridiculous.
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:11.320]  And just because they taught you to laugh at it and say it's a conspiracy theory, you can't do that.
[3:16:11.320 --> 3:16:12.320]  Let's take some calls.
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:13.320]  Dan in the Philippines.
[3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:15.320]  You're on the air with Robert Galen Ross.
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:17.320]  Hello, Dan.
[3:16:17.320 --> 3:16:18.320]  Hello.
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:19.320]  Hello.
[3:16:19.320 --> 3:16:20.320]  Hey.
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:21.320]  Hey.
[3:16:21.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  Wow.
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:24.320]  It's crazy to be on here.
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:28.320]  I've been only recently listening to the show, but.
[3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:29.320]  Well, welcome.
[3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:30.320]  Welcome, Dan.
[3:16:30.320 --> 3:16:32.320]  It's good to have you here with us.
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:33.320]  Go ahead.
[3:16:33.320 --> 3:16:35.320]  Hey, yeah, it's, it's crazy.
[3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:40.320]  You know, 10 plus years ago, I listened to you on the show and I thought it was crazy.
[3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:42.320]  You know, seeing my brother watching on public access station.
[3:16:42.320 --> 3:16:47.320]  I'm from Austin, but I've been living in Manila for almost four years now.
[3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:49.320]  And I thought it was crazy.
[3:16:49.320 --> 3:16:52.320]  And so the last year plus anyways, going on.
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:54.320]  What woke you up?
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:16:59.320]  Actually, it was partly my mom.
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:05.320]  You know, I, I was watching Ron Paul back in the primary days.
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:06.320]  I had a vacation.
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:11.320]  I went back to the states and I saw a video about Ron Paul.
[3:17:11.320 --> 3:17:16.320]  Then I saw freedom of fascism of Aaron Russo woke me up really well.
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:22.320]  And since then, I just been kind of dabbling and now I'm, I'm really going full at it right now.
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:26.320]  I don't, I left my, my company recently and so.
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:31.320]  But see, right there as an example, people wouldn't listen to us 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[3:17:31.320 --> 3:17:34.320]  Now they listen because everything we talked about is now coming true.
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:38.320]  Sir, what's your question for Robert Galen Ross?
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:43.320]  I, I sadly, I don't have a question for him directly.
[3:17:43.320 --> 3:17:44.320]  That's fine.
[3:17:44.320 --> 3:17:45.320]  You're on air.
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:46.320]  Go ahead and make your point.
[3:17:46.320 --> 3:17:47.320]  Okay.
[3:17:47.320 --> 3:17:49.320]  I don't, I don't have a point of question.
[3:17:49.320 --> 3:17:54.320]  I saw a recent video about bracelets with microchips on them that are supposedly attached to your wrist.
[3:17:54.320 --> 3:17:58.320]  And I have a question about this because it seems recent and I haven't really been keeping up,
[3:17:58.320 --> 3:17:59.320]  but this is something.
[3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:02.320]  Can you describe this more to me about the bracelets on the wrist?
[3:18:02.320 --> 3:18:08.320]  In fact, we'll play that guys just YouTube the term taser bracelets.
[3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:14.320]  Homeland security was proposing and they, they, and Homeland Security board said,
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:19.320]  we think it's a good idea for every American five year old child, 80 year old woman,
[3:18:19.320 --> 3:18:26.320]  50 year old black guy, 20 year old white guy, everybody to wear a taser bracelet.
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:30.320]  It's like the running man almost around our neck, but around your wrist,
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:32.320]  guilty until proven innocent.
[3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:35.320]  They've got the naked body scanners going in airports.
[3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:36.320]  Houston has them.
[3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:40.320]  You march your kids through the government records their body on tape.
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:43.320]  Robert Galen Ross, your comment on the taser bracelets.
[3:18:43.320 --> 3:18:52.320]  Well, it's, it's just probably short of the next move to implant a sensor within your
[3:18:52.320 --> 3:18:54.320]  skin, within your wrist.
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:18:56.320]  By the way, that's in the healthcare bill.
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:18:57.320]  Right.
[3:18:57.320 --> 3:19:02.320]  And then the point of that is they can tell where you are at any time.
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:07.320]  They can link it to money so that if you are, if you get out of line,
[3:19:07.320 --> 3:19:12.320]  they shut off your sensor so that you can spend money.
[3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:18.320]  So that's the long range plan is to have some mechanism to absolutely control
[3:19:18.320 --> 3:19:21.320]  everything you do and know where you are at all times.
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:23.320]  And it was two weeks before Tom broke off.
[3:19:23.320 --> 3:19:25.320]  And I appreciate your call from the Philippines, Dan.
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:26.320]  Good to have you on board.
[3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:28.320]  God bless you.
[3:19:28.320 --> 3:19:30.320]  It was right before Dan.
[3:19:30.320 --> 3:19:34.320]  Tom Brocall retired right before Tom Brocall was Tom Brocall.
[3:19:34.320 --> 3:19:37.320]  And I've got the tape around her somewhere and they were talking about Fallujah,
[3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:40.320]  where they have these checkpoints all around it.
[3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:42.320]  And you're given your ID card.
[3:19:42.320 --> 3:19:45.320]  And if you're ever caught without the ID card, you're killed on the spot.
[3:19:45.320 --> 3:19:50.320]  And he said it straight faced on NBC News, Tom Brocall.
[3:19:50.320 --> 3:19:54.320]  He said, and if they're caught without their card, they are executed.
[3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:56.320]  And that's the system.
[3:19:56.320 --> 3:19:57.320]  That's right.
[3:19:57.320 --> 3:19:58.320]  Stay there.
[3:19:58.320 --> 3:19:59.320]  We'll do one more segment with our guest.

[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:04.320]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[3:21:04.320 --> 3:21:06.320]  Now going green can save money.
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:09.320]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries

[3:22:03.320 --> 3:22:08.320]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:11.320]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:22:11.320 --> 3:22:14.320]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:18.320]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR?
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:20.320]  Do you listen?
[3:22:20.320 --> 3:22:27.320]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:22:27.320 --> 3:22:33.320]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:22:33.320 --> 3:22:37.320]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:22:37.320 --> 3:22:43.320]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:22:43.320 --> 3:22:46.320]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:52.320]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.

[3:24:14.320 --> 3:24:16.320]  Final segment with Robert Gail and Ross.
[3:24:16.320 --> 3:24:17.320]  I'm going to go through a news blitz.
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:20.320]  Continue with your calls in the next segment.
[3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:24.320]  He's got a lot of new stuff at his website for rie.com.
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:27.320]  He can also get some of his books and materials at infowars.com.
[3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:31.320]  He's got something new. Who's Who? The Elite by Robert Gail and Ross?
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:33.320]  They don't dare let us tell the people.
[3:24:33.320 --> 3:24:39.320]  It's a computer program and it's got the entire background on the elites,
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:43.320]  the trilateral commission, Bilderberg, Skull and Bones, Council on Farm Relations,
[3:24:43.320 --> 3:24:48.320]  13,795 elite members in 58 nations.
[3:24:48.320 --> 3:24:51.320]  He's got stuff like the first minutes of the first Bilderberg meeting on here.
[3:24:51.320 --> 3:24:56.320]  Really powerful material available and his new book coming out in two weeks.
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:02.320]  What the elite have done to America and how to fix it.
[3:25:02.320 --> 3:25:04.320]  Let's take a few final calls for him.
[3:25:04.320 --> 3:25:08.320]  Jock in California, you're on the year. Go ahead.
[3:25:08.320 --> 3:25:14.320]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be on with you and it was so great to hear Charlie Sheen
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:16.320]  on your show yesterday.
[3:25:16.320 --> 3:25:22.320]  And since President Obama won't talk with Charlie about his 20 points on 9-11
[3:25:22.320 --> 3:25:27.320]  or even acknowledge his letter, and since popular mechanics won't debate him
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:31.320]  live on his 20 points and Larry King won't have him on,
[3:25:31.320 --> 3:25:35.320]  and no other major talk show will have Charlie on.
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:39.320]  I guess it's down to Megan McCain who said on the view on September 10th
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:44.320]  that she wouldn't take Charlie's political advice because of his experience with prostitutes.
[3:25:44.320 --> 3:25:51.320]  Megan is ignoring Charlie's challenge to debate him as well as everybody else,
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:56.320]  but she has a blog called McCain blog yet where anyone can comment,
[3:25:56.320 --> 3:26:01.320]  and I just wondered if it would be interesting if a million patriots wrote comments in them.
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:05.320]  Yeah, no, that's a good idea. People should go to Obama's press conferences.
[3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:08.320]  They should go to his press secretary's comments.
[3:26:08.320 --> 3:26:13.320]  I mean, when Charlie goes to the restaurant, he gets on TV.
[3:26:13.320 --> 3:26:17.320]  Okay, but here he is saying, I'm ready to go on TV to debate you guys.
[3:26:17.320 --> 3:26:22.320]  It'll get huge ratings. They won't touch it because he has the facts.
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:25.320]  He has the evidence. He has those 20 bullet points.
[3:26:25.320 --> 3:26:30.320]  And so the answer to their censorship is to only spread the material.
[3:26:30.320 --> 3:26:35.320]  I'm going to talk about it in the next segment even more to get the material,
[3:26:35.320 --> 3:26:38.320]  to get the 20 minutes with the president, to get his video message
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:42.320]  at thetopofinfowars.com, the 20 minutes with the president area,
[3:26:42.320 --> 3:26:45.320]  and to get it out to everyone. I appreciate your call.
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:49.320]  Let's take another call here. Let's talk to Terry in Indiana.
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:51.320]  Terry, you're on the air.
[3:26:51.320 --> 3:26:53.320]  Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call.
[3:26:53.320 --> 3:26:54.320]  Yes, sir.
[3:26:54.320 --> 3:26:59.320]  I want to talk to you about the statement that Jimmy Carter made today.
[3:26:59.320 --> 3:27:04.320]  I mean, as an African-American, whether you made it yesterday or today,
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:06.320]  his comment is outrageous.
[3:27:06.320 --> 3:27:10.320]  You know, to make it seem like that you would only have to be a white person
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:14.320]  or racist in order to disagree with Obama.
[3:27:14.320 --> 3:27:17.320]  Yeah, exactly. He's using the race card.
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:19.320]  I'll hold you over because I want to talk about this.
[3:27:19.320 --> 3:27:21.320]  I want to be able to say about it, Robert.
[3:27:21.320 --> 3:27:25.320]  But that's exactly what goes on here is they're saying to everybody,
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:28.320]  you're not allowed to be against anything Obama does if you're a racist.
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:33.320]  They're playing a race card brutally, and viciously, and coldly,
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:39.320]  knowing that's not what it's about and actually creating racial division.
[3:27:39.320 --> 3:27:42.320]  And it's doing that successfully. Stay there, Terry.
[3:27:42.320 --> 3:27:45.320]  Thank you for the break, but I want to be able to say bye to Robert here at the end.
[3:27:45.320 --> 3:27:49.320]  Robert, your comment on this, is this a desperation move?
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:54.320]  They will try anything in order to reach their goal.
[3:27:54.320 --> 3:28:01.320]  But you can't really interpret what they're saying because they use a lot of disinformation.
[3:28:01.320 --> 3:28:08.320]  And so there's always a motive behind what they're doing, but it's not an apparent one.
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:13.320]  But the majority of white Americans voted for Obama. His approval rating has dropped by 30-something points
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:15.320]  because he lied about everything.
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:21.320]  But I saw a segment. Someone emailed me a long talk.
[3:28:21.320 --> 3:28:25.320]  It was on YouTube by this black preacher that he says,
[3:28:25.320 --> 3:28:27.320]  look out, don't trust these guys.
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:33.320]  One of these days, the white guys are going to come up and they're going to riot.
[3:28:33.320 --> 3:28:38.320]  And this comes from a black preacher.
[3:28:38.320 --> 3:28:41.320]  Well, look, they put Obama in there to make it about race.
[3:28:41.320 --> 3:28:44.320]  They put him in there to create division.
[3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:50.320]  If he was a black guy that was trying to end the Federal Reserve, they'd assassinate him.
[3:28:50.320 --> 3:28:51.320]  That's right.
[3:28:51.320 --> 3:28:53.320]  Just like if he was a white guy, they'd assassinate him.
[3:28:53.320 --> 3:28:54.320]  And that's the issue.
[3:28:54.320 --> 3:28:56.320]  So it's meant to be this big political football.
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:28:59.320]  And I agree with Terry.
[3:28:59.320 --> 3:29:01.320]  We're going to come back to you after the break.
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:03.320]  Robert, great job on the new book.
[3:29:03.320 --> 3:29:05.320]  I've scanned over it. It's excellent.
[3:29:05.320 --> 3:29:06.320]  This is an advanced copy.
[3:29:06.320 --> 3:29:09.320]  The official cover is going to have a green cover.
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:12.320]  And what the elite have done to America and how to fix it.
[3:29:12.320 --> 3:29:16.320]  You can get it at his website for rie.com.
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:19.320]  And in the last 30 seconds, we've got left.
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:21.320]  Is there a toll-free number folks can call or a number?
[3:29:21.320 --> 3:29:28.320]  It's 800-410-5571.
[3:29:28.320 --> 3:29:29.320]  One more time.
[3:29:29.320 --> 3:29:35.320]  800-410-5571.
[3:29:35.320 --> 3:29:38.320]  Or for anybody that wants to interview you, they can also call that number.
[3:29:38.320 --> 3:29:39.320]  That's great.
[3:29:39.320 --> 3:29:40.320]  We look forward to talking to you again soon.
[3:29:40.320 --> 3:29:44.320]  Another fellow Central Texan fighting the New World Order.
[3:29:44.320 --> 3:29:46.320]  And again, we're just all evil racists here.
[3:29:46.320 --> 3:29:48.320]  We don't want them putting sodium fluoride in the water.
[3:29:48.320 --> 3:29:50.320]  And that's because we're racist.
[3:29:50.320 --> 3:29:51.320]  It's mad.
[3:29:51.320 --> 3:29:55.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.320 --> 3:30:01.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:01.320 --> 3:30:03.320]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[3:30:03.320 --> 3:30:05.320]  And I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:07.320]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[3:30:07.320 --> 3:30:11.320]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[3:30:11.320 --> 3:30:16.320]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[3:30:16.320 --> 3:30:19.320]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive,
[3:30:19.320 --> 3:30:21.320]  immune, and developmental system diseases.
[3:30:21.320 --> 3:30:23.320]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:28.320]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control
[3:30:28.320 --> 3:30:30.320]  of you and your family's drinking water.
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:34.320]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:38.320]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis,
[3:30:38.320 --> 3:30:41.320]  and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:44.320]  That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe.
[3:30:44.320 --> 3:30:49.320]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.
[3:30:49.320 --> 3:30:56.320]  Or visit Acola Blue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[3:30:56.320 --> 3:31:23.320]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:31:23.320 --> 3:31:30.320]  Thank you for watching.
[3:31:53.320 --> 3:32:05.320]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Kalbin Soap.
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:09.320]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned pure handmade soap
[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:13.320]  produced by the Kalbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company
[3:32:13.320 --> 3:32:15.320]  that's over 62 years old.
[3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:19.320]  Go to fivestarsoaps.com or click on their link at infowars.com.
[3:32:19.320 --> 3:32:21.320]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[3:32:21.320 --> 3:32:25.320]  Kalbin Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[3:32:25.320 --> 3:32:28.320]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[3:32:28.320 --> 3:32:30.320]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:33.320]  how much they love the Kalbin Pure Soap products.
[3:32:33.320 --> 3:32:38.320]  Check out their whole line of bath, hair, laundry, and dish soap and more at fivestarsoap.com.

[3:32:53.320 --> 3:32:57.320]  Again, go to fivestarsoap.com and just try their products.
[3:32:57.320 --> 3:33:00.320]  You're going to love them. You will never use anything else again.
[3:33:06.320 --> 3:33:09.320]  You know, we had Robert on today.
[3:33:09.320 --> 3:33:14.320]  I took a lot of calls earlier, but we really should just suspend Yes for the next few weeks.
[3:33:14.320 --> 3:33:17.320]  Except for medical doctors who talk about the flu,
[3:33:17.320 --> 3:33:20.320]  because there's so much going on.
[3:33:20.320 --> 3:33:24.320]  And the listeners are what are interesting and informative and entertaining.
[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:27.320]  But our main goal is here to awaken people.
[3:33:27.320 --> 3:33:35.320]  And again, to me, it is the racism to make it a racial issue if you disagree with the president.
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:37.320]  And they're cold-bloodily doing this.
[3:33:37.320 --> 3:33:42.320]  Chris Matthews and Jimmy Carter, they know what they're doing.
[3:33:42.320 --> 3:33:47.320]  They know it makes them the moral authority, and then you're the racist,
[3:33:47.320 --> 3:33:53.320]  because you're out protesting because the president happens to be part Arab and part African.
[3:33:53.320 --> 3:33:59.320]  But going back to Terry in Indiana, didn't mean to interrupt you with the point you were making.
[3:33:59.320 --> 3:34:02.320]  That was just another subject. Go ahead now. Make your point.
[3:34:02.320 --> 3:34:08.320]  Yeah, Alex, what I was saying is that the media, everything that's done,
[3:34:08.320 --> 3:34:15.320]  whether it's the tea parties, the protest, where all types of independence and everybody is mixed in together,
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:17.320]  they'll turn it into a racial thing.
[3:34:17.320 --> 3:34:23.320]  They'll say, well, it's racism. These people are against Obama because he's black.
[3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:30.320]  It's not that any of these people could love liberty or love freedom or don't want to go to a socialistic state.
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:34.320]  It can't be any of that. It's got to be because he's black.
[3:34:34.320 --> 3:34:39.320]  And then that makes it difficult for the people who always get their news from the mainstream media,
[3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:47.320]  especially minorities and blacks, when you try to come to them with a message about what is truly going on in our government and the world,
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:54.320]  then they have a wall up because they believe that it's all about a racist agenda.
[3:34:54.320 --> 3:34:59.320]  So you can't get a hitch through to try and open their eyes to what's going on.
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:04.320]  And it's really frustrating. I tell you, it's really frustrating.
[3:35:04.320 --> 3:35:08.320]  And I have come out. I have been out of the closet when Obama was a candidate.
[3:35:08.320 --> 3:35:19.320]  I'm calling all other liberty, freedom Americans, freedom loving Americans, blacks, minorities to come out of the closet with me
[3:35:19.320 --> 3:35:23.320]  because they're turning this thing into a white thing.
[3:35:23.320 --> 3:35:29.320]  They want, they want us at each other's throats because look, you've got a tiny, it's very simple.
[3:35:29.320 --> 3:35:38.320]  You've got a tiny group of bankers who are eugenicist and who hate everybody who are putting stuff in the water to sterilize this,
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:45.320]  trying to force deadly inoculations on us, stealing $23.7 trillion, setting up a world government.
[3:35:45.320 --> 3:35:51.320]  And it's in white people's interest in black people's interest in Asians interest in.
[3:35:51.320 --> 3:36:01.320]  I mean, it doesn't matter who you are, 99% of us, it's in our interest to not go along with this world government and the end of the dollar
[3:36:01.320 --> 3:36:03.320]  and all the things they're openly doing.
[3:36:03.320 --> 3:36:08.320]  Now, if we're getting mad at the Federal Reserve, we're wanting to abolish the Federal Reserve.
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:10.320]  The American people are coming together.
[3:36:10.320 --> 3:36:15.320]  The establishment's going to say, tribal warfare, fight with each other.
[3:36:15.320 --> 3:36:23.320]  That's the exact way that the British crown divided the natives and was able to take over the United States.
[3:36:23.320 --> 3:36:27.320]  And then what the army was able to do was play tribe off against tribe.
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:29.320]  There's only a few thousand globalists.
[3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:32.320]  How are they going to beat 7 billion people?
[3:36:32.320 --> 3:36:34.320]  We're almost 7 billion on the planet now.
[3:36:34.320 --> 3:36:41.320]  They're going to do it by divide and conquer, by balkanization, and they're just cold-bloodily doing it.
[3:36:41.320 --> 3:36:48.320]  Anybody who isn't a racist or anybody who's got half a brain sees this and is insulted by it going, I'm not racist.
[3:36:48.320 --> 3:36:53.320]  I don't want, why are you bringing up race as if the other side's going to listen?
[3:36:53.320 --> 3:36:55.320]  They know it's bull, sir.
[3:36:55.320 --> 3:36:59.320]  I mean, obviously, you know that for some of the listeners, they know it's baloney.
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:07.320]  They know it actually creates real racism because it makes people think about it being a racial issue.
[3:37:07.320 --> 3:37:11.320]  But any other comments on that?
[3:37:11.320 --> 3:37:15.320]  That's why I'm calling on all African Americans.
[3:37:15.320 --> 3:37:27.320]  The ones who have their eyes open to stand up because once we stand up and then the people see that there are other blacks who are saying something against Obama, they can't call us racists.
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:29.320]  I hear you, God.
[3:37:29.320 --> 3:37:31.320]  Well, what are these people talking about?
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:33.320]  And then they'll get to the issues.
[3:37:33.320 --> 3:37:35.320]  Exactly. God bless you. Good points.
[3:37:35.320 --> 3:37:43.320]  You should write up an article and send it to writers at infowars.com and make those points because, you know, it needs to be made by black folks.
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:52.320]  Look, it's a total diversion, but now we're having a debate and we have to have a debate about how ridiculous this is to say it's racial.
[3:37:52.320 --> 3:38:03.320]  And sure, out of 2 million people there who are probably a couple hundred thousand didn't don't like Obama because he's black, but I'll guarantee they don't like him for a bunch of other reasons too.
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:05.320]  But it doesn't matter.
[3:38:05.320 --> 3:38:13.320]  Obama, I've gotten emails when I say Obama's a puppet and I've seen it on Myspace and I've seen it on YouTube.
[3:38:13.320 --> 3:38:15.320]  People say, oh, you're just racist.
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:17.320]  You're and it's usually white people.
[3:38:17.320 --> 3:38:19.320]  You can click on their channel name and go to their page.
[3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:21.320]  You can't.
[3:38:21.320 --> 3:38:23.320]  You don't like a black man being over you.
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:25.320]  So you're saying he's a puppet.
[3:38:25.320 --> 3:38:27.320]  No.
[3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:29.320]  I said George Bush senior was a puppet.
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:31.320]  Bill Clinton was a puppet.
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:33.320]  Because they are a puppet.
[3:38:33.320 --> 3:38:37.320]  And I'm actually giving Obama cover here because it's true.
[3:38:37.320 --> 3:38:39.320]  He doesn't deserve all the blame.
[3:38:39.320 --> 3:38:43.320]  George Bush was evil, probably a lot more evil than Obama.
[3:38:43.320 --> 3:38:45.320]  George Bush enjoyed what he was doing.
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:49.320]  I mean, as a man, I like Obama more than I like Bush.
[3:38:49.320 --> 3:38:55.320]  I mean, Bush radiated evil, radiated corruption, but it doesn't matter.
[3:38:55.320 --> 3:38:59.320]  The very same, even more evil groups are in control of him.
[3:38:59.320 --> 3:39:05.320]  But the system cold bloodedly knows this is just meant for all of us to get at each other's
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:13.320]  throats while the Federal Reserve steals three times all the mortgages in the country.
[3:39:13.320 --> 3:39:19.320]  All the mortgages in the country were 9.4 trillion Bloomberg reported.
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:21.320]  So what's three times 9.4?
[3:39:21.320 --> 3:39:25.320]  9 trillion, 9 trillions, 18 trillion.
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:29.320]  And then you add another 9 to that.
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:35.320]  Yeah, you're right at it's 24.3, 23.7, but it's really going to be about 28 now.
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:43.320]  So you're right at three times all the mortgages in the country is what we gave foreign banks.
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:46.320]  Now, are all your mortgages paid off?
[3:39:46.320 --> 3:39:48.320]  See, that's the thing.
[3:39:48.320 --> 3:39:54.320]  All these liberals think you're going to have socialism and that, well, if David Rockefeller's got 100 billion bucks, I'm going to get part of it.
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:39:56.320]  You're not going to get any of that money.
[3:39:56.320 --> 3:40:05.320]  David Rockefeller supports socialism because they're going to take the guy making $100,000 money and they're going to give it all to the ultra rich.
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:12.320]  I have a great graphics guy and I said, make me a wealth redistribution graphic and I wasn't specific.
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:22.320]  And he brought me one of a red house that says a million dollars on it and you got three greenhouses that are smaller that were poor people.
[3:40:22.320 --> 3:40:28.320]  And in his graphic, it shows the red house get littler and the greenhouses get bigger.
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:41.320]  And I said, no, you need to make another graphic of that red house turning into a green house, a smaller house and all the other houses getting even smaller and then a big pyramid above it getting bigger.
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:45.320]  It sucks all the money up out of us into them.
[3:40:45.320 --> 3:40:49.320]  I mean, it's so simple.
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:53.320]  And it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[3:40:53.320 --> 3:41:00.320]  Mexico has more billionaires per capita for 100 million people population than any other country in the world.
[3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:07.320]  And they're also the third poorest country in the world, depending on which gauge you look at fifth poorest.
[3:41:07.320 --> 3:41:09.320]  The point is they're in the top five poorest countries.
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:11.320]  They got more resources than we got.
[3:41:11.320 --> 3:41:13.320]  They got, but they've got a corrupt elite.
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:14.320]  Same thing with Africa.
[3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:16.320]  Same thing with Eastern Europe.
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:22.320]  Same thing. I mean, folks, the boss hogs don't want you to have a nice life.
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:26.320]  They want to shut you down politically so they can control you.
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:31.320]  They want to use the economy to make you poor.
[3:41:31.320 --> 3:41:39.320]  So you're so busy just trying to get enough food to eat that you're not busy getting uppity.
[3:41:39.320 --> 3:41:40.320]  But it is outrageous.
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:44.320]  I mean, Jimmy Carter, I've respected some things he's done.
[3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:49.320]  But I have to remember he's a trilateral commission co-founder with a Rockefeller and he is a eugenicist.
[3:41:49.320 --> 3:41:58.320]  You know, again, Barack Obama took the abortion funding block off for black kids in Africa and forced abortion in China.
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:03.320]  And if you think killing black babies is pro black, then then you're idiots.
[3:42:03.320 --> 3:42:16.320]  And I saw footage of a Hispanic man at an Obama event in Spanish holding up pictures of dead babies to the Hispanics.
[3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:24.320]  And Hispanics were coming over, getting in his face saying he was anti Hispanic because he doesn't like Obama because he doesn't want Hispanics killing Hispanic babies.
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:27.320]  What is your major problem?
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:33.320]  Killing your babies isn't good.
[3:42:33.320 --> 3:42:37.320]  It's the Margaret Sanger phony liberals that are the real racist.
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:44.320]  When are you going to figure it out that a real racist doesn't run up missing their front teeth in a clan hood?
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:56.320]  When are you going to figure out that there are some of those racist, but they are confined to their their shacks and aren't a threat to you unless you're caught in their neighborhood at 3am?
[3:42:56.320 --> 3:43:05.320]  The real threat is the George Soros is the Ted Turner's is the David Rockefeller's is the Bill and Melinda Gates.
[3:43:05.320 --> 3:43:08.320]  These people want your ass dead in a hammer.
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:10.320]  And you know who their man is?
[3:43:10.320 --> 3:43:13.320]  He's Barack Obama because they know they put a black face on this.
[3:43:13.320 --> 3:43:15.320]  You're going to go along with it.
[3:43:15.320 --> 3:43:17.320]  And I am sick of it.
[3:43:17.320 --> 3:43:18.320]  I'm tired of it.
[3:43:18.320 --> 3:43:21.320]  It's so obvious.
[3:43:21.320 --> 3:43:23.320]  Oh man, I'm tired of it.
[3:43:23.320 --> 3:43:24.320]  But you know what?
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:25.320]  It's not going to work.
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:28.320]  Calling everybody racist and dragging racism out.
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:31.320]  Let me tell you how stuff really works.
[3:43:31.320 --> 3:43:33.320]  Most white people are guilty.
[3:43:33.320 --> 3:43:35.320]  And this isn't even targeting black folks.
[3:43:35.320 --> 3:43:41.320]  This is targeting guilty whites to be afraid to criticize anything Obama's doing gun control.
[3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:44.320]  You name it because they don't want to be called racist.
[3:43:44.320 --> 3:43:47.320]  And what the left is doing is using up the term racism.
[3:43:47.320 --> 3:43:52.320]  So when it really needs to be used against somebody who's really racist, nobody's going to want to hear it anymore.
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:56.320]  It looks like Israel calling everybody in any semi who doesn't agree with every policy they've got.
[3:43:56.320 --> 3:43:59.320]  Now that term doesn't work anymore.
[3:43:59.320 --> 3:44:04.320]  So it's cheapening the term.
[3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:07.320]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[3:44:07.320 --> 3:44:09.320]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:12.320]  Listen, I work in finance and got a few quick stories for you.
[3:44:12.320 --> 3:44:21.320]  We had a client of ours go down to, you know, major bank downtown Houston to cash out, you know, a little over a hundred grand in cash.
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:25.320]  And they didn't have it on hand any other way to week.
[3:44:25.320 --> 3:44:34.320]  And got questioned, actually had to talk to the president in the location to have them actually release cash into his hand.
[3:44:34.320 --> 3:44:39.320]  So a lot of these banks around here running very low on actual liquid cash.
[3:44:39.320 --> 3:44:43.320]  Also, they fill out a suspicious transaction report.
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:50.320]  I mean, do people really think the FBI for $5,000 wasn't already watching?
[3:44:50.320 --> 3:44:55.320]  Governor Spitzer, they're watching everybody.
[3:44:55.320 --> 3:45:04.320]  You know, in the brokers community, there's a lot of, you know, since the Patriot Act, we have to fill out a lot of paperwork for new accounts
[3:45:04.320 --> 3:45:08.320]  and ask a lot of questions, you know, where the money coming from, so on and so forth.
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:10.320]  And all those are set up as profiles.
[3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:15.320]  And then every so often those are ran against these terrorist databases and all that stuff.
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:19.320]  And that's, you know, pretty mainstream that people that work in the industry, they know.
[3:45:19.320 --> 3:45:22.320]  That's Patriot Act compliance has nothing to do with terror.
[3:45:22.320 --> 3:45:24.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:26.320]  Another point is very funny.
[3:45:26.320 --> 3:45:34.320]  I was at a dinner last night with some folks from JP Morgan and I'll tell you the cluelessness out there.
[3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:37.320]  In professionals is outstanding.
[3:45:37.320 --> 3:45:44.320]  This woman, 30 years in the business, work, you know, fund manager for JP Morgan,
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:52.320]  talking just general economic stuff and, you know, of course, people bring up inflation and, you know, she just passes it off.
[3:45:52.320 --> 3:45:54.320]  Like it's not a problem and it may actually be a good thing.
[3:45:54.320 --> 3:45:59.320]  And she's like, well, you know, we don't have high inflation because CPI is real low.
[3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:01.320]  And, you know, of course, I bring up the point.
[3:46:01.320 --> 3:46:07.320]  But they cook the CPI real unemployment at 20% and they're telling us it's at 10.
[3:46:07.320 --> 3:46:14.320]  I said, well, if you think there's no inflation, how come gold is four times higher than it was 10 years ago?
[3:46:14.320 --> 3:46:19.320]  And if you price the Dow in gold, it cost 40 ounces of gold to buy it in 2000.
[3:46:19.320 --> 3:46:21.320]  Now it costs like 9.8 ounces.
[3:46:21.320 --> 3:46:26.320]  So if you didn't quadruple your money in stocks, you lost purchasing power.
[3:46:26.320 --> 3:46:28.320]  And she said, well, that doesn't matter.
[3:46:28.320 --> 3:46:29.320]  We're not on a gold standard.
[3:46:29.320 --> 3:46:31.320]  You know, gold is a commodity who cares.
[3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:33.320]  But look at every other look at oil.
[3:46:33.320 --> 3:46:35.320]  We're paying a lot more than we were 10 years ago for that.
[3:46:35.320 --> 3:46:41.320]  Yeah. I mean, it's look, look, they can tell us that everything costs the same.
[3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:46.320]  Anybody who's been to the grocery store knows that's a load of bull.
[3:46:46.320 --> 3:46:48.320]  No, you're absolutely right.
[3:46:48.320 --> 3:46:53.320]  But it's just so hilarious to see, you know, professionals that don't even give it a second.
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:47:00.320]  You know, thought and and someone else brought up the point of, you know, she said she just came back from China.
[3:47:00.320 --> 3:47:02.320]  It's like working with the sovereign wealth fund over there.
[3:47:02.320 --> 3:47:07.320]  And I said, well, what are the, you know, what are they telling you about slowing down their T bill purchases?
[3:47:07.320 --> 3:47:08.320]  Talking about world currency.
[3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:13.320]  I mean, it's in mainstream news and she's just like, ah, you know, that, that'll never happen.
[3:47:13.320 --> 3:47:15.320]  They have to buy T bills.
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:16.320]  They can't do anything else.
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:19.320]  You know, they're, you know, they're never going to stop.
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:20.320]  What are they going to do?
[3:47:20.320 --> 3:47:21.320]  I'm like, well, they don't have to.
[3:47:21.320 --> 3:47:23.320]  They can invest their money wherever they want to.
[3:47:23.320 --> 3:47:26.320]  Well, they've already for two years been cutting back.
[3:47:26.320 --> 3:47:27.320]  I appreciate your call.
[3:47:27.320 --> 3:47:28.320]  Great points, David.
[3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:31.320]  Yeah, you get all these specialized people.
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:36.320]  And they know their little niche and then that's it.
[3:47:36.320 --> 3:47:40.320]  And they think it's like an attribute that they don't care.
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:42.320]  They think it's cute or funny.
[3:47:42.320 --> 3:47:46.320]  And if you fight for your liberty, you're probably going to lose it.
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:49.320]  If you don't care about it, you're going to get run over.
[3:47:49.320 --> 3:47:51.320]  Manfred Montana.
[3:47:51.320 --> 3:47:53.320]  Manfred, you're on the air.
[3:47:53.320 --> 3:47:54.320]  Hi, Alex.
[3:47:54.320 --> 3:47:55.320]  I've been listening to you for a year.
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:47:56.320]  First time call.
[3:47:56.320 --> 3:47:58.320]  I just got out of the military also a year ago.
[3:47:58.320 --> 3:48:00.320]  Welcome.
[3:48:00.320 --> 3:48:03.320]  Thank you, sir.
[3:48:03.320 --> 3:48:08.320]  I've got a question about the votes, the ballots.
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:10.320]  Yes.
[3:48:10.320 --> 3:48:13.320]  Why can't we have nobody on there?
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:18.320]  I mean, every party starts with these great ideas about equality and all this other great jazz,
[3:48:18.320 --> 3:48:19.320]  but they always get corrupted.
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:22.320]  Why can't we just incorporate nobody on the bill?
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:28.320]  Well, the systems have never been perfect, but you have the very same special interest
[3:48:28.320 --> 3:48:31.320]  and the shadow government that's not even a shadow anymore.
[3:48:31.320 --> 3:48:36.320]  The National Security Council is advised by private interest and they set the policy.
[3:48:36.320 --> 3:48:43.320]  If you hold politicians accountable on issues like like Glenn Beck's a politician.
[3:48:43.320 --> 3:48:47.320]  He's, he, he's for the banker bailout bill.
[3:48:47.320 --> 3:48:50.320]  But then after he gets it, he then says he's against it.
[3:48:50.320 --> 3:48:57.320]  See, so you've got to go off politicians voting records off of, off of political pundits records.
[3:48:57.320 --> 3:49:03.320]  Do they flip flop as bad as our system is?
[3:49:03.320 --> 3:49:05.320]  It's because it's been overthrown.
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:10.320]  A lot of people then want to create a new system, which will be even worse.
[3:49:10.320 --> 3:49:16.320]  It's that our original system, let's say you got a diesel engine and you're putting rainwater in it.
[3:49:16.320 --> 3:49:17.320]  It's not starting.
[3:49:17.320 --> 3:49:21.320]  Well, it's not the diesel engines fault is that you put the wrong fuel in it.
[3:49:21.320 --> 3:49:22.320]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:25.320]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[3:49:25.320 --> 3:49:27.320]  I don't disagree with that.
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:37.320]  But I think if we have nobody on the ballot, if nobody gets voted in, then we have to start over with new candidates with new ideas and it embarrasses the parties.
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:46.320]  Well, I do think that unless you're Ron Paul or a few other people, you need to be voted out both parties, all this Republican grandstanding.
[3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:47.320]  I see right through it.
[3:49:47.320 --> 3:49:51.320]  I appreciate your call, Manfred Joseph in California.
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:49:52.320]  Go ahead.
[3:49:52.320 --> 3:49:53.320]  Hello.
[3:49:53.320 --> 3:49:54.320]  Yes.
[3:49:54.320 --> 3:49:55.320]  Hi.
[3:49:55.320 --> 3:50:05.320]  I was just calling about there's a big protest here in the Bay Area about the universities and they arrested them for unlawful assembly saying that they're shoving the police.
[3:50:05.320 --> 3:50:08.320]  But there's nothing on the news about them shoving anybody.
[3:50:08.320 --> 3:50:14.320]  It just seems like, you know, out here in the Bay Area, the First Amendment doesn't exist anymore.
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:29.320]  Like myself, I'm in a lawsuit against SFPD for arresting me for public drunkenness when I was in fact sober and I found your site, you're addressing something about DUI and prohibition law.
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:43.320]  Well, yes, all over the world, police are suppressing free speech because they've been ordered to because they know that they've tried to cow the public into submission knowing the financial raping was about to happen.
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:46.320]  Knowing we would rightfully take our government back.
[3:50:46.320 --> 3:50:50.320]  They don't want that image of slaves on the street saying no.
[3:50:50.320 --> 3:50:55.320]  But as the police lose their pension funds too, they're going to end up joining us.
[3:50:55.320 --> 3:50:59.320]  So I would tell you, take legal action against those that have violated your rights.
[3:50:59.320 --> 3:51:14.320]  I'll be right back.
[3:51:30.320 --> 3:51:32.320]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[3:51:32.320 --> 3:51:39.320]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.

[3:51:56.320 --> 3:52:02.320]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y today.
[3:52:02.320 --> 3:52:08.320]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.320 --> 3:52:14.320]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:52:14.320 --> 3:52:20.320]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:20.320 --> 3:52:22.320]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[3:52:22.320 --> 3:52:25.320]  Yeah, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:25.320 --> 3:52:29.320]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist,
[3:52:29.320 --> 3:52:37.320]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:37.320 --> 3:52:41.320]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.320 --> 3:52:48.320]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.320 --> 3:52:57.320]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:57.320 --> 3:53:01.320]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[3:53:01.320 --> 3:53:06.320]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[3:53:06.320 --> 3:53:09.320]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago. He was devastated.
[3:53:09.320 --> 3:53:16.320]  But it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day,
[3:53:16.320 --> 3:53:24.320]  there is no job security. You are always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[3:53:24.320 --> 3:53:27.320]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[3:53:27.320 --> 3:53:37.320]  So MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves and not for others.
[3:53:37.320 --> 3:53:44.320]  MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight
