[06:16.840 --> 06:21.240]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think

[07:08.600 --> 07:11.240]  supply until there was none left at any price
[07:11.240 --> 07:14.920]  we would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for
[07:14.920 --> 07:19.080]  those unable to care for themselves we would intend not to be standing in the
[07:19.080 --> 07:22.680]  breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food
[07:22.680 --> 07:26.200]  disappearance are untrue if the experience of the Katrina
[07:26.200 --> 07:30.120]  disaster is evidence the breadline may have no bread
[07:30.120 --> 07:33.880]  just like the good intentions on the road to that on heavenly place
[07:33.880 --> 07:37.880]  the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us

[08:48.680 --> 08:53.160]  out there period on national television in fact he's the only person that i
[08:53.160 --> 08:59.080]  agree with almost a hundred percent and he's a constitutional lawyer judge of
[08:59.080 --> 09:03.560]  course award-winning researcher bestselling author
[09:03.560 --> 09:08.440]  and we are very very honored to have him on he's the author of constitutional
[09:08.440 --> 09:11.080]  chaos what happens when the government breaks its own laws
[09:11.080 --> 09:14.680]  new york times bestseller the constitution in exile how the federal
[09:14.680 --> 09:17.640]  government has seized power by rewriting the supreme law of the land
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.080]  and a nation of sheep he's got a new book coming out but he's with us until
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.560]  the bottom of the hour so let's move quickly judge i've got my list of rapid
[09:25.560 --> 09:29.000]  fire questions but i am ready for you and thank you for that very generous
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.440]  introduction my friend well the truth is veritas and
[09:32.440 --> 09:35.160]  stands on its own so the truth is the truth not an
[09:35.160 --> 09:39.240]  introduction just the truth judge but before i get into my questions
[09:39.240 --> 09:44.600]  what is most important on your radar what's important on my radar is fidelity
[09:44.600 --> 09:48.120]  to the constitution it's the supreme law of the land and
[09:48.120 --> 09:51.240]  everybody in the government has taken an oath to uphold it
[09:51.240 --> 09:56.840]  yet we see the political maneuverings and and and utter disregard of the
[09:56.840 --> 10:00.360]  constitution with everything from bailouts which
[10:00.360 --> 10:04.440]  aren't authorized with everything from regulating uh
[10:04.440 --> 10:08.360]  contracts that banks can enter into and salaries that can pay their executives
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.520]  which aren't authorized to trying people before military tribunals
[10:12.520 --> 10:15.880]  because we hate the person or we hate the manner in which they attempted to
[10:15.880 --> 10:18.680]  commit their crime none of that is authorized
[10:18.680 --> 10:23.960]  my greatest fear is that lack of fidelity to the constitution
[10:23.960 --> 10:27.640]  will expose innocent people to the wrath of the government
[10:27.640 --> 10:30.520]  in ways that the founders could never have imagined
[10:30.520 --> 10:33.960]  but i must tell you very very few presidents
[10:33.960 --> 10:37.160]  and very very few congresses from the first one
[10:37.160 --> 10:41.480]  to the present one have been utterly faithful to the constitution
[10:41.480 --> 10:46.360]  they make their living by finding ways around it
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.520]  well how do you hold somebody for five to seven years admittedly torture them
[10:52.520 --> 10:58.200]  and threaten their families and then use that evidence in trials
[10:58.200 --> 11:02.280]  i mean america is over if we allow this to happen the president
[11:02.280 --> 11:06.200]  is then set for the end of habeas corpus and everything else that protects
[11:06.200 --> 11:09.480]  absolutely you're you're a hundred percent on the mark if the government
[11:09.480 --> 11:11.960]  can do that and the government has done it
[11:11.960 --> 11:16.360]  and gotten away with it i mean the government arrested hosay padilla at
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.480]  ohare airport because of a conversation he had in pakistan
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.680]  mr padilla was born in brooklyn new york his uh his birth records are better
[11:26.680 --> 11:29.800]  known than the birth records of the president president of the united
[11:29.800 --> 11:33.400]  states even though this happened under the under the bush years
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.280]  he was kept in uh in solitary confinement and tortured for four years
[11:38.280 --> 11:41.560]  without any communication with anybody from the outside
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.280]  not even the guards who fed him his meals and escorted him to the bathroom
[11:46.280 --> 11:50.520]  uh and then when the supreme court was about to say you can't do that
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.440]  they suddenly sprung him from that solitary confinement
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.560]  with no charges put him in a regular federal jail
[11:57.560 --> 12:01.400]  charged him with a bogus crime and persuaded a jury to convict him
[12:01.400 --> 12:04.520]  and claimed that he didn't use any of the evidence that he spilled
[12:04.520 --> 12:09.560]  under torture uh against him he did this to an american citizen
[12:09.560 --> 12:13.560]  because of a conversation he had on a trip to pakistan
[12:13.560 --> 12:17.560]  not because he tried to shoot anybody not because he tried to explode a bomb
[12:17.560 --> 12:21.080]  not because he had bomb making materials with him but because he landed
[12:21.080 --> 12:24.520]  at ohare airport within a few hours of the conversation
[12:24.520 --> 12:27.560]  if they can do that to him they could do it to anybody
[12:27.560 --> 12:30.040]  and if they could do it to him they could do it to anybody
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.840]  uh so these are my peers alex and i am seriously fearful of this the bush
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.240]  administration showed less fidelity to the constitution
[12:39.240 --> 12:42.200]  than any administration since abraham lincoln
[12:42.200 --> 12:47.080]  this administration is picking up exactly where bush left off
[12:47.080 --> 12:51.560]  is doing it with uh less in your face there is no dick cheney
[12:51.560 --> 12:55.960]  in this administration who's boasting about torture who's boasting about
[12:55.960 --> 12:59.960]  deficits who's boasting about locking people up and throwing away the key
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.760]  but they're doing the very same thing well judge
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.760]  hitler targeted unpopular groups to set the precedent but in the end the
[13:08.760 --> 13:11.320]  target was the german people in surrounding nations
[13:11.320 --> 13:15.160]  agree and it's the and expanding on this if we allow
[13:15.160 --> 13:19.480]  torture to be admissible evidence then north vietnam
[13:19.480 --> 13:23.320]  was good in torturing our soldiers and airmen into lying
[13:23.320 --> 13:28.360]  and north korea was good and the soviets uh were good and what we know
[13:28.360 --> 13:31.480]  from the mayak and homeland security reports that we got
[13:31.480 --> 13:35.640]  and released to the public in 2009 what we know is
[13:35.640 --> 13:39.080]  the real architecture of homeland security in north com
[13:39.080 --> 13:43.640]  is pointed at red-blooded conservatives libertarians gun owners returning
[13:43.640 --> 13:47.720]  veterans and so what a perfect way to fool middle america
[13:47.720 --> 13:51.240]  and and conservatives into going along with tyranny and secret arrest and
[13:51.240 --> 13:54.920]  rendition and torture then saying it's for men that don't
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.080]  look like us from foreign countries to set that precedent when really
[13:59.080 --> 14:02.520]  the entire howitzer of tyranny is really
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.760]  focused and pointed at america well of course i mean
[14:06.760 --> 14:12.600]  war is the health of the state and fear is what gets us into into war
[14:12.600 --> 14:15.720]  what my new book is called lies the government told you comes out next
[14:15.720 --> 14:19.720]  month myth power and deception in american history
[14:19.720 --> 14:26.280]  question what f dr have been reelected in 1944 if the public knew
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.360]  he caused pearl harbor not look the other way
[14:30.360 --> 14:36.120]  but caused it to happen question would george w bush have been reelected in 2004
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.720]  if the public knew he made up the reasons for
[14:39.720 --> 14:43.720]  invading uh iraq that he was torturing people
[14:43.720 --> 14:47.480]  and spying on americans and lying about it question
[14:47.480 --> 14:51.960]  what fd would lbj have defeated barry goldwater would he have successfully
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.440]  portrayed himself as the peace candidate if the public had secretly known
[14:56.440 --> 15:00.680]  the public knew that he had secretly made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident and
[15:00.680 --> 15:04.280]  was secretly planning to vamp up the vietnam war
[15:04.280 --> 15:08.440]  bigger question why did all these presidents want war because people are
[15:08.440 --> 15:11.640]  afraid in wartime and they will surrender their liberties
[15:11.640 --> 15:15.400]  and they will look the other way when agents of the government come for their
[15:15.400 --> 15:20.040]  neighbors they will only complain when agents of the government come for them
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.840]  shifting gears to the pretext for war and we have a prison planet dot com
[15:24.840 --> 15:29.720]  article by steve watson and top neoconservative
[15:29.720 --> 15:33.400]  daniel pipes writing for national review says
[15:33.400 --> 15:36.920]  obama should save presidency by attacking iran
[15:36.920 --> 15:41.160]  and invoking a crisis the level of 911 that reminds me
[15:41.160 --> 15:45.480]  of the philadelphia daily news article
[15:45.480 --> 15:50.760]  titled one month from the anniversary i'm thinking of another 911 would help
[15:50.760 --> 15:54.600]  america uh i mean these guys are
[15:54.600 --> 15:59.560]  right out in the open saying they want new wars and the cia
[15:59.560 --> 16:03.640]  is saying we will be hit by al-qaeda in the next three to six months and then
[16:03.640 --> 16:06.520]  dovetailing that judge i want your take on this
[16:06.520 --> 16:10.280]  kurt haskell his wife and a bunch of other witnesses went public and said a
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.120]  smart dressed man got the underwear bomber in amsterdam on the plane
[16:14.120 --> 16:18.040]  and the state department came out last wednesday and said detroit news dot com
[16:18.040 --> 16:22.440]  and said yes we let him on to track him as al-qaeda
[16:22.440 --> 16:25.960]  and there was another man on the plane supposedly with a bomb now the fbis
[16:25.960 --> 16:29.880]  backtracked on that but it's it's it's buried in abc news report
[16:29.880 --> 16:33.240]  it's not getting the traction it needs this looks like
[16:33.240 --> 16:36.920]  an attempt at provocateur or let the terrorist attack is
[16:36.920 --> 16:40.920]  as a pretext so obama composes a savior
[16:40.920 --> 16:46.600]  well of course it is uh and and all of this stuff came out
[16:46.600 --> 16:49.800]  not that the state department let him on the plane
[16:49.800 --> 16:54.360]  but that the fbis has been entered into some kind of an agreement with his
[16:54.360 --> 16:58.520]  family so that he can speak with uh with uh with the fbis
[16:58.520 --> 17:02.520]  uh and and that we are in danger of another nine eleven in fact these
[17:02.520 --> 17:05.640]  characters uh told us that a committee was absolutely certain that it was going
[17:05.640 --> 17:07.720]  to happen i don't know how that could be certain but any
[17:07.720 --> 17:11.240]  all this comes out at a time when the president's polls are low
[17:11.240 --> 17:14.920]  when the democrats are losing ground and i i i hold no water for the
[17:14.920 --> 17:17.960]  republicans because they're virtually all big government
[17:17.960 --> 17:22.440]  status ron paul and a dozen or so in the house of the exceptions to the rule
[17:22.440 --> 17:25.880]  but when the president needs shoring up
[17:25.880 --> 17:31.880]  is when they decide they want to scare us and what would scare us more than the
[17:31.880 --> 17:35.160]  director of the fbi the director of central
[17:35.160 --> 17:38.520]  intelligence and the director of national intelligence all
[17:38.520 --> 17:42.200]  answering yes yes yes to the question are we
[17:42.200 --> 17:46.360]  certain to be attacked again those specifics no examples
[17:46.360 --> 17:49.640]  no evidence just it's going to happen so be afraid
[17:49.640 --> 17:54.280]  be very afraid and ps give us your freedoms so that we can keep you safe
[17:54.280 --> 17:56.840]  that's what we'll come next and let's go back
[17:56.840 --> 18:01.720]  i remember in 2002 2003 and then even r.e. flies here white house press
[18:01.720 --> 18:05.240]  secretary bizarrely in a press conference said we're issuing these for
[18:05.240 --> 18:08.760]  political gain i guess to try to cover his hind in
[18:08.760 --> 18:12.440]  but ridge came out as you know in a best-selling book last year
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.120]  that the former head of homeland security and said we issued these
[18:16.120 --> 18:19.960]  for political effect under the patriot act issuing
[18:19.960 --> 18:25.800]  a fake uh a terror threat is an act of terrorism itself
[18:25.800 --> 18:30.600]  absolutely absolutely because it is it is lying
[18:30.600 --> 18:34.680]  to the american public and when the government lies to us
[18:34.680 --> 18:40.920]  and we rely on that false information we make poor choices because we don't
[18:40.920 --> 18:44.280]  know the truth we vote for presidents who tricked us
[18:44.280 --> 18:49.240]  like fdr george bush and lbj they end up with more power
[18:49.240 --> 18:53.480]  they start destructive wars and sap our freedoms
[18:53.480 --> 18:57.560]  it's the same pattern over and over and over again
[18:57.560 --> 19:02.280]  and with obama stalling on every front with his copenhagen greenhouse gas tax
[19:02.280 --> 19:05.720]  open world government being announced failing the flu hoax coming out

[19:38.600 --> 19:42.920]  nixonian in in in 74 he is going to need a crisis
[19:42.920 --> 19:46.200]  and we've got neocons and establishment liberals saying

[19:50.840 --> 19:56.280]  open judge where do you see obama going starting a war picking a fight

[22:31.800 --> 22:35.800]  at interest forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt is this capitalism
[22:35.800 --> 22:39.800]  or was jefferson correct when he said a central bank issuing a public currency
[22:39.800 --> 22:43.240]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army

[23:44.360 --> 23:47.480]  to the liberties of the people than a standing army hi ted anderson i'm
[23:47.480 --> 23:50.920]  placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system call for
[23:50.920 --> 23:54.840]  your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to understand the
[23:54.840 --> 24:02.200]  system call 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237
[24:02.200 --> 24:05.800]  austin is coming out with a 2.6 billion dollar tax
[24:05.800 --> 24:12.040]  in the first three years on all human activity natural gas oil you name it in
[24:12.040 --> 24:15.240]  violation of state and federal law they can't the senate to pass it so they're
[24:15.240 --> 24:20.280]  just doing it we have uh... obama saying he will
[24:20.280 --> 24:23.640]  now sign the united nations small arms treaty
[24:23.640 --> 24:29.000]  which national gun rights blog headline us agrees to timetable for gun ban
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.640]  uh... so my point is on every front he can't get the
[24:33.640 --> 24:37.560]  senate to say carbon dioxide deadly poison so he says the e p a will just do
[24:37.560 --> 24:41.640]  it he's taken over the city's right he's coming after our guns through treaty
[24:41.640 --> 24:43.400]  what do we do
[24:43.400 --> 24:45.480]  uh... to fight this
[24:45.480 --> 24:49.560]  well under the constitution uh... as you know and as uh... most people listening
[24:49.560 --> 24:53.160]  to us now no alexa treaty is meaningless until
[24:53.160 --> 24:58.200]  it's enacted by two-thirds of the senate i doubt that the president could get two
[24:58.200 --> 25:02.040]  thirds of the senate to enact a treaty that would interfere with any orders of
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.280]  bureaucracy to do it pardon me but then he just orders the bureaucracy to do it
[25:06.280 --> 25:10.360]  well i don't know if he orders the bureaucracy to follow a treaty that has
[25:10.360 --> 25:14.120]  not been enacted then the first person who is harmed
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.960]  by behavior of a bureaucrat say it's you or me with a lawful
[25:17.960 --> 25:21.800]  weapon being seized by a a federal agent because
[25:21.800 --> 25:24.840]  the bureaucracy has told the agent to do it he claims he's just
[25:24.840 --> 25:29.080]  doing his job then we would have to challenge this in court and hopefully
[25:29.080 --> 25:33.720]  we would find uh... judges that are faithful to the constitution
[25:33.720 --> 25:38.360]  but he cannot create law on his own he wishes he could
[25:38.360 --> 25:42.040]  and treaties basically create law which is why
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.400]  a they require a two-thirds vote of the constitution
[25:45.400 --> 25:49.720]  and b they cannot interfere with any fundamental liberties
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.720]  guaranteed by the constitution and thanks to a great opinion called heller
[25:53.720 --> 25:57.240]  h-e-l-l-e-r written by justice Antonin Scalia
[25:57.240 --> 26:00.600]  last year we now know that the right to keep and bear arms
[26:00.600 --> 26:04.280]  is a fundamental read natural right like the right
[26:04.280 --> 26:07.160]  to defend yourself in a fight in the streets
[26:07.160 --> 26:11.000]  and the government can't take that right away though we know
[26:11.000 --> 26:15.000]  they will try you've said this more effectively that anybody else on air
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.360]  alexa first thing that tyrant does is to disarm the citizenry
[26:18.360 --> 26:23.960]  because they fear more than anything else and armed citizenry
[26:23.960 --> 26:28.040]  and i guess you have the states come down on cities that are
[26:28.040 --> 26:30.840]  unconstitutionally going along with this as well well
[26:30.840 --> 26:34.360]  but that's not going to happen in new york or in illinois
[26:34.360 --> 26:38.920]  where as you say new york city and chicago have virtually banned guns and
[26:38.920 --> 26:42.680]  utter disregard for the heller they're trying to police other states of cities
[26:42.680 --> 26:46.520]  well they're about to get their comeuppance i i i can tell you that it
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.520]  is my opinion that the supreme court agreed to hear
[26:50.520 --> 26:54.120]  two cases from a federal appeals court in new york city and from a federal appeals
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.440]  court in chicago in order to smack them down and says heller and to tell them
[26:58.440 --> 27:02.040]  that heller is the law and the second amendment not only says
[27:02.040 --> 27:05.880]  the feds can't interfere with your right to keep and bear arms but
[27:05.880 --> 27:09.320]  no government can interfere with your right to keep and bear arms
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.680]  look alexa in my opinion couldn't registration laws are unconstitutional
[27:14.680 --> 27:19.080]  the government has no more right to know that i own a gun than it does to know
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.400]  that i own a pair of shoes all right moving moving quickly absolutely i
[27:23.400 --> 27:26.840]  have a question here from one of our twitter people it says is nullification
[27:26.840 --> 27:30.360]  a workable solution for the overreaching fed or will it take
[27:30.360 --> 27:34.360]  secession i i i think it will take nullification by a good
[27:34.360 --> 27:38.760]  number of states before the feds the federal government takes note of a
[27:38.760 --> 27:42.600]  single state nullifies the federal government like virginia is on the
[27:42.600 --> 27:47.000]  verge of enacting a statue which would make it a crime in virginia
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.960]  to follow federal health care law that of course will create a conflict between
[27:51.960 --> 27:55.800]  state and federal a federal judge will probably rule for the feds
[27:55.800 --> 27:59.320]  but if many many other states did the same thing
[27:59.320 --> 28:04.040]  the commerce would fear that that many states could gang up on it in a
[28:04.040 --> 28:06.920]  constitutional and we are on that road so so so you
[28:06.920 --> 28:10.360]  agree with many listeners that one of the key battlegrounds is getting our
[28:10.360 --> 28:14.040]  states back that's the achilles heel of this globalist system
[28:14.040 --> 28:17.400]  absolutely okay we've only got a minute and a half left
[28:17.400 --> 28:21.480]  where do you see america going we know the republicans people like brown
[28:21.480 --> 28:25.640]  getting in massachusetts it's a good message to obama to back off
[28:25.640 --> 28:30.120]  the problem is these republicans are just as bad once they get in
[28:30.120 --> 28:34.440]  but it took eight years to wake up to bush or seven years it took a year to
[28:34.440 --> 28:37.480]  wake up to obama the system knows the people
[28:37.480 --> 28:41.320]  aren't putting up with the bait switch what happens when republicans get in
[28:41.320 --> 28:45.080]  and continue to sell us out to the foreign banks do we go into revolution
[28:45.080 --> 28:49.240]  i don't think we go into revolution but i have spoken to enough tea parties
[28:49.240 --> 28:53.880]  to know that they are about 90 filled with freedom lovers who reject the
[28:53.880 --> 28:57.560]  republican party as much as they do the democratic part of it
[28:57.560 --> 29:00.840]  it is that type of rejection that will save us
[29:00.840 --> 29:04.200]  that's the only thing we can do peacefully well i'm for a peaceful
[29:04.200 --> 29:08.600]  revolution of info war calling into talk radio websites banner
[29:08.600 --> 29:11.320]  hangs we are the majority if we just don't shut
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.120]  up and we have natural law and truth on our side
[29:14.120 --> 29:17.640]  there's no way these criminals in government can get away with it
[29:17.640 --> 29:23.240]  i agree with you that and you my friend are doing more than anybody i know i'm
[29:23.240 --> 29:27.240]  trying to keep up with you to educate the public in the dangers of too much
[29:27.240 --> 29:31.240]  government and guess what the message is getting through a while god bless you

[35:50.600 --> 35:52.840]  definitely don't want to miss any of this
[35:52.840 --> 35:55.720]  during the break i was talking to judge andrew napolitano
[35:55.720 --> 35:59.800]  he did not know about detroit news and the state department saying yes we
[35:59.800 --> 36:02.520]  ordered them to let this guy get on the plane
[36:02.520 --> 36:05.720]  because we were tracking al qaeda oh they're always tracking them
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.120]  oh we ordered the state department to let mohammed adda and others in
[36:10.120 --> 36:14.920]  in 2000 well we got springman on the head of the visa section of the embassy
[36:14.920 --> 36:18.120]  next week uh they ordered him to let them in saying oh
[36:18.120 --> 36:22.120]  well their al qaeda designation is a cia cover
[36:22.120 --> 36:25.640]  it's always the same and then who gets to lose their freedoms
[36:25.640 --> 36:29.480]  who gets targeted by all this police state you and i that's who
[36:29.480 --> 36:34.200]  gets targeted by it ladies and gentlemen
[36:36.600 --> 36:42.120]  we cover such a wide range of incredibly important
[36:42.120 --> 36:45.400]  issues and dynamic stories that are constantly
[36:45.400 --> 36:52.280]  changing and evolving that routinely i will cover a bombshell issue
[36:52.280 --> 36:56.600]  but it just gets mixed in with all the other incredibly important issues
[36:56.600 --> 37:02.360]  though it's even more important and the fact is if you study politics and you
[37:02.360 --> 37:07.560]  study the geopolitical strategies used by the anglo-american
[37:07.560 --> 37:11.000]  establishment and that means that doesn't mean white people
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.040]  people always get emails saying why are you saying anglos are bad that that's
[37:14.040 --> 37:19.720]  it's it's a geographic designation in a geopolitical system
[37:19.720 --> 37:23.000]  england and the us are known as the anglo-american
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.200]  power axis okay i'm talking about these rich nations run by the bankers okay
[37:30.200 --> 37:34.440]  and we know what their strategies are in the past we know what their current
[37:34.440 --> 37:39.560]  strategies are and we know what they are currently
[37:39.560 --> 37:47.640]  doing they are openly and publicly on a monthly basis bare minimum
[37:47.640 --> 37:50.840]  more often than that i miss most of it there's no way to keep track of all
[37:50.840 --> 37:56.200]  this ladies and gentlemen openly saying they want to enslave the people of
[37:56.200 --> 38:01.560]  europe england the us that they use terror as a pretext to enslave us
[38:01.560 --> 38:07.720]  their milk cows we are the target they openly state they want to launch new
[38:07.720 --> 38:12.120]  wars to expand their empire and to distract the public
[38:12.120 --> 38:16.040]  from the trillions they've stolen from the banker
[38:16.040 --> 38:21.400]  bailout robbery from all the crimes being committed
[38:21.400 --> 38:25.560]  the public is now learning about all the secret of private trust
[38:25.560 --> 38:29.160]  that the trillions were put through by geithner Bernackie
[38:29.160 --> 38:32.440]  Paulson and others and it's all illegal on its face
[38:32.440 --> 38:37.880]  that's in my stack giving themselves waivers to give themselves hundreds of
[38:37.880 --> 38:43.160]  millions of dollars a piece is absolutely illegal
[38:43.160 --> 38:45.720]  ordering
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.520]  the the federal reserve ordering the federal
[38:50.520 --> 38:53.880]  controllers of aig when the government took it over
[38:53.880 --> 38:57.560]  to not file and to not tell the public or the media
[38:57.560 --> 39:04.360]  who aig was giving the money to is illegal on its face
[39:04.360 --> 39:07.960]  and then the debate starts up well did geithner know and then it comes out
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.800]  yes he indeed did know in the emails as the new york fed that his lawyers were
[39:11.800 --> 39:15.480]  ordering the federal regulators to do this
[39:15.480 --> 39:20.840]  which is backwards to have the private fed telling them what to do but that's
[39:20.840 --> 39:24.360]  how it's set up okay why aren't the lawyers that
[39:24.360 --> 39:30.280]  wrote the emails under geithner being indicted you know they'll roll over
[39:30.280 --> 39:33.800]  and expose geithner that happens but we don't need them to roll over geithner's
[39:33.800 --> 39:36.760]  been on tv more times than i can even keep track of
[39:36.760 --> 39:39.560]  you've all seen him saying we won't tell you where the money went
[39:39.560 --> 39:45.560]  it's our policy to make it secret so it's a lie out in the open so
[39:45.560 --> 39:48.760]  what are they going to do well i'm going to tell you what they're going to do
[39:48.760 --> 39:52.520]  they're going to launch new wars and they are going to stage terror attacks
[39:52.520 --> 39:55.480]  and there's no doubt the underwear bomber was that that's been proven without a
[39:55.480 --> 39:58.200]  shadow of a doubt
[39:59.080 --> 40:03.240]  there is no doubt and now i just put
[40:03.240 --> 40:05.960]  napolitano onto it i'm sure he'll be covering in the next few days he was
[40:05.960 --> 40:08.600]  unaware of the fact of the state department even admits that oh well
[40:08.600 --> 40:11.320]  we let him get on the plane we protected him
[40:11.320 --> 40:14.120]  and yeah we lied about the second man on board the plane and the bomb that was
[40:14.120 --> 40:17.240]  supposedly found and we lied about haskell and now he's been proven
[40:17.240 --> 40:23.080]  right and yeah somebody was videotaping him
[40:23.960 --> 40:31.240]  they are clearly playing the terror card and the war card right now
[40:31.240 --> 40:35.640]  what are we going to do about this we had better
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.240]  get the word out on this at the grassroots now
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.000]  this is the number one issue just like i told you we need to target all fire
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.520]  power on the copenhagen fraud and and the climate
[40:46.520 --> 40:51.480]  gate knowing that would then blow up sky high and there's no need to
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.560]  spend all our time on that now because new scandals two new scandals came out
[40:55.560 --> 40:58.920]  today dwarfing climate gate emails i mean it's just
[40:58.920 --> 41:04.120]  it it's like bombing an aircraft carrier and hitting the magazine where
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.040]  all the munitions are you just better get get back
[41:08.040 --> 41:13.000]  you don't need to pump any more rounds into that dead horse
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  at the international level at least until later this year
[41:17.000 --> 41:20.680]  when they try again in what's seven eight months in
[41:20.680 --> 41:27.800]  mexico city now it's the local fight but see on the flu fraud on the banker
[41:27.800 --> 41:30.920]  takeover fraud on the new war they want with iran
[41:30.920 --> 41:34.840]  and yemen and pakistan all of their frauds
[41:34.840 --> 41:41.560]  their healthcare fraud their new banker robbery that they call a jobs bill
[41:41.560 --> 41:44.600]  and congressmen are on record saying it's not a jobs bill it's another
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.080]  banker bailout which isn't a bailout it's lies within lies within lies
[41:49.080 --> 41:53.000]  within lies within hoaxes within frauds within spin within scams within more
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.840]  lies their entire agenda is in flames
[41:58.840 --> 42:05.320]  right now if this is allowed to continue
[42:05.320 --> 42:09.960]  the new world order is crippled they're hurt right now
[42:09.960 --> 42:12.680]  it's kind of like they got gang green in one of their legs
[42:12.680 --> 42:18.120]  and if they don't stage a terror attack which is basically the penicillin
[42:18.120 --> 42:21.080]  and save that leg they're going to have to cut it off
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.600]  and be seriously crippled it may even kill them
[42:24.600 --> 42:28.440]  it may politically rock their whole body it could even be too late
[42:28.440 --> 42:32.600]  but people have this foregone conclusion that freedom can't win
[42:32.600 --> 42:38.840]  and that liberty is impossible no that's a that's mind control
[42:38.840 --> 42:42.040]  that's a foregone conclusion and planted in your brain
[42:42.040 --> 42:45.160]  and why am i the number one person fighting the new world order as you
[42:45.160 --> 42:48.440]  heard napolitano say earlier the number one person
[42:48.440 --> 42:52.280]  because i understand history and we can win and that's why i'm the number one
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.400]  target of coantel pro disinfo hoaxes propaganda lies
[42:57.400 --> 43:01.160]  so anytime you see me being attacked you better research it fully
[43:01.160 --> 43:04.840]  because you're always going to find out it's a liar of fraud or you will hear
[43:04.840 --> 43:13.640]  me come out and say i was wrong which is very rare
[43:13.800 --> 43:16.840]  i can't spend my time responding to lies
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.600]  i can't spend my time when dean haglund here is a great guy
[43:20.600 --> 43:25.080]  and says oh you're you're you're owned by abc aren't you
[43:25.080 --> 43:30.600]  just a total lie but i can't spend my time countering it
[43:30.600 --> 43:35.880]  and if i do it doesn't matter so it regardless folks you need to take
[43:35.880 --> 43:39.640]  action against tyranny and not be distracted by the continued
[43:39.640 --> 43:43.960]  sustained organized attacks on myself
[43:44.840 --> 43:49.560]  i am not a scientologist i am not nothing wrong with it but i'm not catholic
[43:49.560 --> 43:53.160]  i'm not jewish nothing wrong with that but i'm not
[43:53.160 --> 43:55.480]  um
[43:55.480 --> 44:01.640]  we are not owned by abc we have at least three different
[44:01.640 --> 44:06.040]  satellites over the years that's what anybody on talk radio if you try to go
[44:06.040 --> 44:10.040]  start a show about dirt buggy racing around the
[44:10.040 --> 44:13.320]  country and you want to syndicate it there's one way to do it and that's to
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.200]  rent a jones a clear channel or an abc and it's not even abc now it's
[44:18.200 --> 44:23.480]  something else the point is that's how
[44:23.480 --> 44:31.560]  disinfo works but let's just say this is an abc radio show it's not
[44:31.560 --> 44:35.560]  okay what are you going to do about the fact they want to stage new terror attacks
[44:35.560 --> 44:38.520]  and go to war with iran what are you going to do about them taking over your
[44:38.520 --> 44:43.080]  cities to implement around congress
[44:43.080 --> 44:48.360]  the carbon tax what are you going to do about joblessness rates exploding
[44:48.360 --> 44:51.320]  what are you going to do about them attempting to have forced inoculations
[44:51.320 --> 44:54.840]  around the country you better fight it and stand up
[44:54.840 --> 45:00.440]  and go against it because we got a chance of winning ladies and gentlemen
[45:00.440 --> 45:04.200]  but it's not just me that gets attacked it's anybody who's real
[45:04.200 --> 45:09.720]  and who effectively is actually exposing the system and hurting it is going to
[45:09.720 --> 45:13.960]  have hit pieces written about them from above and below from the fake grass roots
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.160]  right up to the top that's the badge of honor
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.640]  that's the signature the battle wounds
[45:21.640 --> 45:26.680]  on my war helmet and on my breastplate the fact that i've got a dented war
[45:26.680 --> 45:29.720]  helmet on and the fact that my sword has got
[45:29.720 --> 45:36.440]  notches in it and is more of a club these days
[45:36.440 --> 45:41.400]  is the signature of the bona fide because they don't want you to know
[45:41.400 --> 45:45.960]  there's real patriots or real heroes they don't want you to know because you
[45:45.960 --> 45:50.040]  will then envision yourself as that and you will become the leaders
[45:50.040 --> 45:59.560]  that you were meant to be so i will tell you all right here today
[45:59.560 --> 46:03.320]  that if you commit to the fight against tyranny
[46:03.320 --> 46:07.000]  and take action we will defeat these people
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.560]  but i will tell you here today without a shadow of a doubt
[46:11.560 --> 46:18.280]  just as i told you six months before two months before a week before
[46:18.280 --> 46:21.880]  and on the day of 9 11 that they were going to stage an attack on the world
[46:21.880 --> 46:26.280]  trade center and blame it on their cias said to some have been lauding
[46:26.280 --> 46:29.880]  i have only issued two separate alerts after this
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.880]  when they were clearly in the preparatory phase getting the public ready
[46:33.880 --> 46:41.720]  for stage terror attacks 2004 and 2007
[46:41.720 --> 46:47.080]  remember when shaney told us news and world report a us city will be nuked
[46:47.080 --> 46:50.920]  they had tommy franks on the payroll running around saying one more attack
[46:50.920 --> 46:54.760]  we get a military dictatorship to keep you safe and i told you that was a
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.080]  government paid for op and it came out he was on the payroll to say that
[46:59.080 --> 47:04.200]  they are trying to prepare you but because we got the word out
[47:04.200 --> 47:08.840]  and because 9 11 truth wounded the dragon
[47:08.840 --> 47:13.720]  and exposed false flag terror and the false flag paradigm and the inside job
[47:13.720 --> 47:20.680]  self-inflicted wound rise stag paradigm the fake terror stage terror paradigm
[47:20.680 --> 47:27.880]  because you got the word out because we are changed and 9 11 truth
[47:27.880 --> 47:32.680]  took the heat and went up against the co until pro
[47:32.680 --> 47:36.520]  and because i went up against them now the general public knows about it and
[47:36.520 --> 47:40.280]  it's very hard for the enemy to do it but all their major
[47:40.280 --> 47:44.200]  pundits are saying we need a new crisis we need a new war
[47:44.200 --> 47:48.280]  and the terror is a common and the cia says it's going
[47:48.280 --> 47:57.000]  to happen
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.440]  they say we're going to be hit within three to six months i'm going to be
[48:00.440 --> 48:04.440]  breaking this down in the next segment
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.400]  remember all the co until pro that we are changed new york went through every
[48:09.400 --> 48:12.520]  time they went to public events they got arrested on the street
[48:12.520 --> 48:16.040]  they got arrested going to press conferences we had to raise money for
[48:16.040 --> 48:19.800]  luke send them more cameras remember jeremy tallis that's his
[48:19.800 --> 48:26.600]  official name german tallis is his nickname out of a dark
[48:26.600 --> 48:30.840]  corner outside a bookstore where laura bush was speaking
[48:30.840 --> 48:35.640]  a man comes running out with a little girl on a wheelchair and begins ramming
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.560]  it into him screaming don't attack my daughter don't attack my daughter
[48:39.560 --> 48:46.360]  and i went on air and i defended tallis i defended luke i exposed that was a
[48:46.360 --> 48:50.600]  fraud you my listeners raised them the money for the lawyer
[48:50.600 --> 48:54.920]  part of it and they went to court even though he was facing a decade in
[48:54.920 --> 48:58.280]  prison under fake charges and made it come out on stand and the secret
[48:58.280 --> 49:02.280]  service admit that they actually attacked him
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.440]  and boy did i get a lot of heat alex you're sticking up for somebody
[49:06.440 --> 49:11.960]  who attacked a girl in a wheelchair and a lot of patriots bought the scyop ladies
[49:11.960 --> 49:14.280]  and gentlemen and there's so many other examples of this
[49:14.280 --> 49:17.080]  but in the end the new york post had to print a full
[49:17.080 --> 49:25.480]  retraction it was all a hoax they're masters of deception
[49:25.480 --> 49:28.920]  they're masters of like michelle melkin sitting behind me screaming kill
[49:28.920 --> 49:33.720]  michelle melkin and saying i had said that but the truth came out
[49:33.720 --> 49:37.320]  and the truth comes out when i go to events when mentally ill people or
[49:37.320 --> 49:40.840]  provocateurs or whatever run up and stage a
[49:40.840 --> 49:44.120]  distraction and then blame me for what they've done
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.320]  that comes out in the end because the truth
[49:47.320 --> 49:51.480]  always comes out
[49:54.120 --> 49:58.280]  the truth is incontrovertible and god is on our side
[49:58.280 --> 50:02.520]  and we are winning and no matter whatever happens to alex
[50:02.520 --> 50:07.640]  jones as we go into stormier and stormier waters
[50:08.360 --> 50:12.040]  the truth has been laid the track has been laid
[50:12.040 --> 50:15.800]  it's out there and the people are discovering it
[50:15.800 --> 50:19.480]  and we know their strategy and they are green lighting
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.960]  stage terror attacks right now and if we get the word out
[50:23.960 --> 50:27.240]  about the underwear bomber about the gulf of talking about all these other
[50:27.240 --> 50:31.800]  events when they stage it it is going to blow up in their face
[50:31.800 --> 50:36.360]  and it won't take three or four years to expose it like 9-11 did
[50:36.360 --> 50:43.240]  it's going to happen very very quickly
[50:45.960 --> 50:49.000]  i'm going to come back and break down the details of this on the other side
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.400]  but realize the national media attacks 9-11 truth is the number one enemy
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.320]  because we are their enemy we have exposed their favorite trick and they
[50:57.320 --> 51:01.240]  absolutely hate us and they've got their operatives crawling all over us

[54:45.480 --> 54:50.680]  in Egypt. Here's our article from December 27th two days after the
[54:50.680 --> 54:54.920]  underwear bomber now completely proven to be absolutely accurate.
[54:54.920 --> 54:59.160]  Government allowed plain bomber to attempt attack
[54:59.160 --> 55:03.720]  and now it's all come out. Just like we told you the UN was going to announce
[55:03.720 --> 55:07.320]  they want to censor, tax and regulate and make you get a license to be on the
[55:07.320 --> 55:09.800]  internet. Now they've gone public with it and time
[55:09.800 --> 55:17.320]  magazine is calling for it. That's coming up later. I told you by the 27th
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.360]  when I went live on that Sunday after the underwear bombing after Christmas I
[55:22.360 --> 55:26.360]  said they're putting the naked body scanners in and next they're going to
[55:26.360 --> 55:29.960]  say people have breast implants and bombs in their
[55:29.960 --> 55:33.240]  stomachs like drug mules and they're going to try to
[55:33.240 --> 55:37.960]  chest x-ray. They say you shouldn't get more than five of
[55:37.960 --> 55:43.240]  those in your life. Everyone when they fly. Oh
[55:43.240 --> 55:48.520]  London Guardian, CBS News, Al Qaeda bombers learned from drug smugglers.
[55:48.520 --> 55:52.520]  New technique of storing bomb materials inside body cavity.
[55:52.520 --> 55:56.280]  Nearly kills a Saudi prince.
[55:57.400 --> 56:01.400]  Here's another one. World net daily MI5 hunting breast
[56:01.400 --> 56:07.000]  implants of death. Authorities alarmed by possibility of surgically placed
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.080]  bombs. That's yesterday. World net daily.
[56:11.080 --> 56:16.040]  See now you're going to have to be fully x-rayed not just naked body scan
[56:16.040 --> 56:19.800]  and next Homeland Security for two years has been looking at making you wear
[56:19.800 --> 56:26.120]  taser bracelets. Everyone becoming total prisoners saying you can't get up for
[56:26.120 --> 56:31.080]  the last hour of the flight. You can't put a blanket over your lap.
[56:31.080 --> 56:39.880]  All of us being trained to live as prisoners.
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.080]  Now as soon as our next guest leaves I'm going to get into this because this is
[56:43.080 --> 56:45.640]  the top story. This is the most important issue.
[56:45.640 --> 56:50.920]  This isn't just a story or an article. This is what they're planning.
[56:50.920 --> 56:54.120]  This is what they're doing. Neocon says Obama
[56:54.120 --> 56:58.040]  should save presidency by attacking Iran. This came out last night. National
[56:58.040 --> 57:02.520]  Review. It's an article at prisonplanet.com. Very dangerous.
[57:02.520 --> 57:07.400]  I want to go back to the Philadelphia Daily News headline.
[57:07.400 --> 57:11.640]  One month from anniversary I'm thinking another 9-11 would help America.
[57:11.640 --> 57:18.040]  Lemitz, Stu Baikovsky in his Philadelphia Daily News column.
[57:18.040 --> 57:22.120]  And I have more of these.
[57:22.120 --> 57:28.360]  The Neocons. Remember the top generals in that meeting with
[57:28.360 --> 57:31.480]  Rumsfeld? The tape got released three years ago where they said we need another 9-11
[57:31.480 --> 57:35.400]  sir. He said yes I know. I need a big article about all of this. I know
[57:35.400 --> 57:38.600]  Paul Watts is working on it right now. There's just so many instances where
[57:38.600 --> 57:43.320]  they must have it. Their entire agenda is imploding.
[57:43.320 --> 57:47.480]  I'm telling you the underwear bomber. I told you the months before that. Look for
[57:47.480 --> 57:52.280]  staged events and now it's beginning.
[57:52.280 --> 57:57.320]  They are moving against free humanity. They are in trouble. They are down in the
[57:57.320 --> 58:00.120]  mud of their axles. They must stage terror attacks.
[58:00.120 --> 58:02.760]  And that's why it's so important that everyone see
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.600]  terror storm and loose change final cut. We've got loose change final cut for
[58:06.600 --> 58:09.560]  five dollars. You may know all about 9-11. Your
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.880]  friends and family don't get it. Terror storm. You need to pre-order how we'd
[58:13.880 --> 58:15.960]  won the west exposing government drug dealing.

[58:50.200 --> 58:53.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.960 --> 58:57.960]  solar power generator. Number one new climate legislation could easily
[58:57.960 --> 59:02.040]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two our new energy czar wants to
[59:02.040 --> 59:05.320]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[59:05.320 --> 59:09.560]  It's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[59:09.560 --> 59:13.160]  technology is coming. Number three in some areas of the country
[59:13.160 --> 59:17.640]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[59:17.640 --> 59:21.480]  is only compounding the problem. Number four dangerous weather is always a
[59:21.480 --> 59:24.680]  threat to local grids. Every year thousands of families lose
[59:24.680 --> 59:28.600]  their power from weather related onages. Number five a solar power generator
[59:28.600 --> 59:31.480]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[59:31.480 --> 59:34.360]  Folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solution
[59:34.360 --> 59:37.240]  from Science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more

[1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:23.080]  live from Austin Texas Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:29.160]  Wolfgang Wodark is our guest for at least the next 30 minutes a very busy
[1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:32.440]  individual. We are honored to have him. This is a
[1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:36.120]  major newsmaking interview. He is the head of health at the
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:41.320]  Council of Europe and we have the 47 nation body now
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:46.360]  investigating falsified swine flu pandemic health ministers and
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:50.760]  officials being on the payroll worldwide in different countries to push the fear
[1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:54.920]  the dangerous nature of the vaccine all the deaths that were caused in the trials
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:59.000]  a few years ago of the bird flu. He's investigating in all
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.120]  we salute him they've been having their investigation the last few weeks
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:05.880]  so here to break it down for us is Dr. Wolfgang
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:10.600]  Wodark and sir we really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:16.600]  Thank you that I can be with you today. Again tell us about just basically about
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:20.440]  the health council of Europe why you started your investigation what your
[1:01:20.440 --> 1:01:25.880]  investigation is finding. I'm a physician myself and I was
[1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:29.320]  director for many years of a public health institution north in
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:33.080]  Germany observing the flu waves coming every year
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:39.320]  and as my region has about 120,000 inhabitants I used to count about 10
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:43.320]  percent of the population getting ill with a flu and
[1:01:43.320 --> 1:01:47.000]  something or symptoms of a flu almost every year
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:50.760]  so when I observed this what we heard last April
[1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:54.360]  about Mexico City a region with 20 million people
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:57.960]  I was very much astonished that there were only
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:01.480]  thousand cases when somebody already spoke about the pandemic
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:04.760]  I didn't understand that because in my small town we had more
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:07.800]  dizzy more people getting ill within one or two weeks
[1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:11.480]  from from the influenza too when there was an influenza
[1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:15.160]  and so I started investigating and I found out that
[1:02:15.160 --> 1:02:18.680]  this was due to a change of definition WHO had
[1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:23.160]  changed the definition what a pandemic is me as a public health
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:26.840]  doctor I learned that the that a pandemic is something spreading very
[1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:30.440]  fast but as the flu always spreads every year
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:34.440]  very fast or as fast as the planes fly so this
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:38.040]  was nothing new and a pandemic which is really worthwhile
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:41.880]  an alarm or an alert reaction of the people of this world
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:45.640]  this is a pandemic which has serious diseases which goes along with very
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:50.760]  high mortality with many deaths and so when I heard about the
[1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:54.040]  Mexican cases I was curious why they did this because it
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:57.800]  didn't give any sense there was nothing extraordinary there were mild
[1:02:57.800 --> 1:03:02.520]  cases it was not even a new virus this was obvious very soon because
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:06.440]  elder people didn't get ill people older than 60 almost didn't get ill
[1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:10.440]  and this is a very clear indication for that they have already been vaccinated
[1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:14.680]  with a similar virus or that they have been infected with a similar virus
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:19.000]  some years ago or many years ago so this is
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.600]  so I didn't understand why this happened
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.520]  and now you've had a chance to begin your investigation when
[1:03:26.520 --> 1:03:30.280]  when did the council start looking at this yeah the council
[1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:35.880]  decided in the middle of last of the December on the 11th of December in
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:40.120]  last year there was a session in the committee of
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:46.520]  social affairs and health in Paris and we had an anonymous decision that we
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:49.320]  want an urgent debate on the topic
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:53.720]  because we wanted to reinstall trust in the WHO because
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:57.240]  many the population in Europe is very much
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:00.840]  yeah astonished about this agency because they just
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:04.600]  they advised us twice now or at least twice
[1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:07.960]  and they told us there's be a big threat for us it was a bird
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:11.800]  flew where they said thousands of people may be dead
[1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:18.040]  and they said it now the same way with the swine flu so we want to reinstall
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:21.480]  health in this we want to reinstall trust in this
[1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.920]  WHO and this is why we wanted an urgent debate and we are 47 countries and in
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:29.640]  this parliamentary assembly of the council of Europe
[1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:33.480]  we have all the parliamentarians we have the national parliamentarians from
[1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.680]  47 countries we have the opposition parliamentarians
[1:04:36.680 --> 1:04:39.640]  you have the governing parties there so if you
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:44.680]  transport the topic to this platform you can be sure that there is a
[1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:48.200]  discussion 47 times in the different nations
[1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:51.640]  okay doctor doctor not to interrupt but we have to break
[1:04:51.640 --> 1:04:56.440]  Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg is our guest he's the head of the health council of Europe
[1:04:56.440 --> 1:04:59.160]  we're going to break down what they found and it's incredible
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:01.800]  on the other side
[1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:06.040]  hi folks this is Alex Jones don't want to tell you about the silver lungs

[1:06:06.120 --> 1:06:09.320]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:13.320]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:16.520]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[1:06:16.520 --> 1:06:20.520]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:25.800]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:08.760]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:16.120]  dr wolfgang woe dark has been the head of health council of europe until
[1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:20.360]  late last month now he rotated off that post is still an honorary member of it
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:23.880]  now he's a private citizen medical doctor who can now speak about this
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:27.560]  they've been investigating and since last year they've now started the formal
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:32.520]  investigation from a week and a half ago and we have the quotes here from the
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:37.880]  resolution about big pharma pushing this
[1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:42.520]  most of the white house here the scientific experts on the payroll
[1:08:42.520 --> 1:08:45.640]  they talk about it being a dangerous vaccine the german government wouldn't
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:49.960]  take it wouldn't give it to the troops our media lied and said there wasn't
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:54.280]  mercury in it and of course it killed a fraction of
[1:08:54.280 --> 1:08:57.960]  those with the regular flu does so so that's what they're looking at so
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:01.240]  in that first segment doctor we got up to the point of
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:05.720]  the formal investigation starting what did you guys hear in testimony
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:09.720]  in the last few weeks and then break down personally
[1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:13.880]  some of the statements you've made the research of what this appears to be
[1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:18.280]  yeah the we had the who was present in the first edition and there will be a
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:21.240]  report which will be finished in june and there will be
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:25.560]  recommendations for our member governments how to handle this problem
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:29.000]  in future because we have seen that the government
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:33.320]  had to order or ordered a lot of vaccines and they were obliged they made
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:35.640]  marketing commitments with pharmaceutical companies
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:39.560]  because they were threatened by specialists by scientists that there
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:42.440]  could be something very dangerous coming and
[1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:45.880]  so they just made those contracts and within those contracts which was secret
[1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:49.560]  which we could not see as parliamentarians uh there was written that
[1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:53.800]  the who was at the trigger to say this is a pandemic and if they say it then
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:58.760]  the whole business was on and they had to take the vaccines for pandemic use
[1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:04.600]  and this were about 18 billion dollars worldwide value and this is a lot of
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:09.080]  money in health so uh we we were wondering because of this mild
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:13.560]  flu how such a such an enormous base of money could happen and
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:16.760]  how millions of people could have been vaccinated
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:21.400]  parallelly to the seasonal vaccination so it's a double vaccination
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:27.240]  uh without any scientific evidence to do so and there were there is
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:30.040]  poland for instance where the health minister she's
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:34.040]  experienced in public health as she said no we don't buy this vaccine
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:37.240]  and the Polish now are very well off they are not vaccinated they didn't spend
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:40.360]  the money and in other nations the people didn't trust the
[1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:43.800]  French for instance they bought for 90 percent of the population they bought
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:47.080]  vaccines and only six percent took the vaccine it's
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:50.440]  similar in Germany and nevertheless people are well off
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:54.680]  this was the mildest flu ever and uh the people were much clever
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:57.800]  much more clever than the government so we have to find out what was going on
[1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:01.320]  with whl why did they do this pandemic alarm
[1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:05.080]  and we found out that there is a public-private partnership within whl
[1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:07.800]  which developed the last 10 years and which
[1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:11.480]  the very powerful pharmaceutical companies seem to have used
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:14.680]  quite well for them for their purpose for their shareholders
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:20.840]  because the the decisions there were the reason why they now earn so much
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:24.840]  money with this vaccine and we don't know what really
[1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:28.760]  happened we only know that they changed the definition of pandemic
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:32.680]  which was a very dangerous thing before and now it's just a normal flu is called
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:35.480]  a pandemic and this is the reason why the business
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:40.360]  pharmaceutical companies was open well
[1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:44.680]  doctor looking at this and again we're talking to the former head he
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:48.920]  just left his post a regular rotation off of it
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:52.520]  last month as the head of the health council of europe
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:56.360]  i still go on cooperating with my colleague and working on this
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:11:58.920]  matter very intensive so you're still part of it
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:04.360]  the my point is this so out of the gates and we notice this they changed the
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:09.800]  definition of a pandemic so because they knew that it
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:12.680]  was very mild and wasn't a pandemic by the old
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:17.160]  measurement not even near so out of the gates we know
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:22.440]  that that is fraud and then in the reports i've been reading
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:26.840]  the council and yourself have been talking about uh that the vaccine wasn't
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:30.120]  properly tested was approved without testing
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.080]  thanks to government's declarations of emergency
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:36.760]  that's why they went with the pandemic designation correct
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:41.160]  yes too because uh if you if the if the pharmaceutical companies wanted to have
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:43.960]  a real business they they have a monopole on the
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:47.480]  vaccines and this is what they tried by using new vaccines
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:52.680]  using adjuvants using new technologies to to breed the virus for the vaccine
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:57.080]  and this was a patented method so they could monopolize it
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:13:01.800]  and tell the government that this was a pandemic vaccine a special one which
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:06.520]  they can produce more quickly than normally
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:10.040]  and this is what they made the contract and so
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:13.160]  this is the trick how the big pharmaceutical companies
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:17.080]  they had this marketing commitment
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:21.320]  that normally normally can yeah pardon go ahead
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:24.920]  yeah normally you can if you have the virus which is to come
[1:13:24.920 --> 1:13:28.680]  you make a mixture of certain viruses you expect to come and there are so many
[1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:33.000]  facilities all over the world which would be able to produce non-patented
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.040]  vaccines everywhere very fast and very much
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:41.240]  adapt to the epidemiological situation but when you do this with a
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:45.400]  monopole when you have such a small passage only
[1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:49.320]  and and everything has to go through those few enterprises
[1:13:49.320 --> 1:13:52.760]  it is not faster it's not quicker and i think it is
[1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:57.320]  just the wrong pandemic plans we do we should have no patents on vaccines this
[1:13:57.320 --> 1:14:00.120]  is what we think politically the council of europe already had a
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:04.920]  decision on this we said there should be no patents no monopoles possible
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:10.520]  on life-saving vaccines because doctor doesn't that also incentivize the big
[1:14:10.520 --> 1:14:14.200]  pharma to engage in hype and hoaxes and fraud because it is a
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:18.680]  monetary driver yes i think it is it is their
[1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:22.440]  trick that they always try to monopolize this and we
[1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:26.600]  pay much more like this if we would pay the scientists
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:31.240]  to find out the best the best vaccines and develop the best vaccines
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:35.880]  and let this do without patents and let them be copied all over the world very
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:40.120]  fast all right the tax payer would be much better off and it would be much
[1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:43.320]  cheaper now dr wolfgang uh wudarg i want to move
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:46.280]  quickly because i know your time is precious here and you're very busy i
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:50.040]  have so many questions but i thought that i just have when you
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:52.840]  mentioned the third world they're already saying
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:56.680]  they're going to ship this throughout the year around the world
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:00.120]  when they admit that the virus is already mutated and is already
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:04.600]  even weakening more and in six months a year it'll be absolutely worthless if
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:07.960]  it wasn't already worthless and they're saying they're going to ship the
[1:15:07.960 --> 1:15:11.000]  unused vaccine because the hoax failed the people didn't
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:14.520]  take it en masse to the third world i mean is that not
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:18.840]  manifest fraud on top of fraud right there but there is no influence of the
[1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:21.960]  hot in the hot countries and they don't need it
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:24.920]  and there is no no influence in the Arctic neither
[1:15:24.920 --> 1:15:29.480]  the virus needs a certain climate to spread and this is only in our regions
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:32.600]  in winter and so we don't the third world
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:35.960]  doesn't need it really but i had a discussion yesterday with japanese
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:39.640]  colleagues and the japanese they are going to have the vaccination campaign
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:43.080]  in february so they just will start now and they know
[1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:47.480]  already that it is a very mild flu to come and there is no danger in it
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:52.360]  but the japan bought vaccines for 110 million people
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:56.920]  and they cannot retire from this vaccine contract
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:59.880]  so they are in a very very big political dilemma now
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:03.960]  and they have very big problems because the japanese people they already know
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:07.560]  it wouldn't be necessary to get vaccinated what shall japan do with all
[1:16:07.560 --> 1:16:10.680]  its vaccines but that's my next issue is this is
[1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:14.920]  destroying the credibility of the entire medical system when it is big pharma
[1:16:14.920 --> 1:16:19.400]  that is doing it in the council of europe report
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:24.040]  it is discussed that this is an untested dangerous vaccine can you speak to
[1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:27.480]  that also can you speak to the german military and
[1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:31.080]  government ministers being given a special additive free
[1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:33.720]  vaccine that is in a very strong vote of confidence
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:37.400]  yeah this is the two this is two points the first thing is that the pandemic
[1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:41.640]  vaccine has is a pandemic vaccine and it was it was
[1:16:41.640 --> 1:16:45.880]  planned to be produced very fast trust me and
[1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:50.200]  so this is the we have additives at juven's and with it
[1:16:50.200 --> 1:16:55.320]  and they are only tested with elderly people this is why the f the fda in us
[1:16:55.320 --> 1:17:00.040]  didn't allow this vaccine to be used with children and younger people in u.s
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:04.040]  and so u.s people population is well better protected against
[1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:08.920]  those side effects but in europe we just use them for children for pregnant
[1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:12.120]  women and there are no clinic there's no clinical testing
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:16.760]  has been done with with children and with some of the vaccines and there are
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:19.400]  other vaccines which you spoke about for soldiers
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:23.320]  this is a vaccine which takes the whole virus and it is known to have more
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:26.120]  side effects so it's not better than the one
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:30.680]  the rest of the population gets well yes sir doctor we know what adjuvants did
[1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:34.520]  with the anthrax shot the pentagon suspended it because in young people
[1:17:34.520 --> 1:17:36.840]  as you know doctor before the audience may not
[1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:40.280]  when you give a young person who has a really strong immune system
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:43.400]  an adjuvant it can trigger what the cytokine
[1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:47.960]  storm and have the lungs fill full of liquid similar to hemorrhagic fever
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:52.600]  correct this i don't i don't have this scientific
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:56.600]  evidence for this but i know that the adjuvants they stimulate the immune
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:59.720]  system enormously and this may lead to
[1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:03.480]  misfunction of the immune system which means that there may be
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:06.920]  autoimmune diseases or allergic diseases result
[1:18:06.920 --> 1:18:11.160]  afterwards within those vaccinated people so well what about all the confirmed
[1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:16.360]  cases of guillaume beret guillaume beret was there when they had this
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:22.200]  vaccine some it was in in in u.s when they stopped
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:26.200]  having this and this is the there is evidence for this but
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:30.120]  what they what they use now is a new patent adjuvant and we don't have any
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:34.440]  ad we don't have any evidence how the side effects of this will be
[1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:39.800]  but this is the big risk and it would not be necessary to take this risk
[1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:43.480]  i mean sure if the flu was killing tens of millions of people it might be if you
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:47.000]  could trust the shot but if it's a mild
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:51.480]  bottom line doctor you personally looking at the research is this a giant
[1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:56.120]  hoax uh was this i mean we know they paid off most the big health ministers
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:59.720]  to come out in fear monger is that not a conflict of interest
[1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:03.720]  it is for sure it is a conflict of interest those people who are therefore
[1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:06.920]  their shareholders who are ahead to have the interest of the pharmaceutical
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:11.080]  companies and to earn a lot of money they have different reasons to decide and
[1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:15.560]  they decide differently than those people who are in charge of public health
[1:19:15.560 --> 1:19:19.640]  and of safety and the whl is an institution a public institution for
[1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:22.760]  public health and it should not its decision should not be
[1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:27.000]  influenced by the by the interest of the industry
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:30.600]  and this seems to be what happened there is no other explanation
[1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:34.920]  for those decisions bottom line it's a hoax
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:39.640]  yes unbelievable uh doctor wolfgang

[1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:25.480]  he was the head of the investigation for the 47 member
[1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:29.080]  nation body council of europe parliamentary assembly
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:33.080]  over health and they just had the start of the intense
[1:24:33.080 --> 1:24:36.440]  investigation i want to get into that in the next segment
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:40.600]  any new breaking info that came out what you were told by big pharma that you
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:44.280]  had before you but first doctor you talk about the bird
[1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:48.040]  flu and i have the check republic news i have
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:51.800]  the london telegraph where they were mixing
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:56.520]  weaponized i mean very deadly bird flu in thank god they found out it was
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:00.040]  killing the test animals we have homeless people die after bird flu
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:04.120]  vaccine trial in poland roughly 30 that were given it
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:08.120]  died the media never said what big pharma company that was you mentioned
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:12.440]  that that hoax as well can can you speak to that
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:16.040]  oh i'm not so much in this matter i only know that the enterprise of backs the
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:22.040]  sand such stuff to uh 16 lever laboratories in europe
[1:25:22.040 --> 1:25:26.600]  and that in check republic they found out that it is a very dangerous mixture
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:30.760]  which they send and they it is said that they send it by accident
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:35.720]  but the enterprise doesn't declare anything and as far as i know they have
[1:25:35.720 --> 1:25:39.320]  been no parliamentary investigation i think there should be a very deep and
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:42.760]  thorough investigation on this what i know is there is some court
[1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:47.000]  dealing with this so we have to to look at the single state
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:51.160]  and i think the german parliament should to be engaged in this and have a look
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:54.040]  uh what happened really what happened why it happened
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:57.960]  it is a very dangerous thing if those materials are handled if those dangerous
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:04.600]  viruses are handled uh by people who who are not very responsible
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:08.280]  and who are not very much bound to public interest and to public health
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:12.120]  this is the dangerous thing and uh if an enterprise
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:16.360]  which goes for money has such stuff i think it is not uh
[1:26:16.360 --> 1:26:23.080]  we should not allow this i also saw a lot of top genetic engineers and
[1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:27.000]  scientists in the headlines i would imagine you saw a doctor
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.520]  saying this was clearly a manufactured that the that the swine flu appeared to
[1:26:32.520 --> 1:26:34.920]  come out of nowhere in the wrong hemisphere
[1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:39.880]  wrong time of year and then it had a pedigree leading back to laboratories
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:44.760]  it is a funny thing that it went like it went and it it is an unusual event
[1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:48.760]  which happened and the blow-up which was made
[1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:55.160]  very soon after the whole thing started uh seems to be an indication that there
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:58.920]  was a that there were people already waiting for something to happen to use
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:02.040]  this what happened for their purposes it looks like
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:06.360]  that uh but we have to find out what really happened and we don't know it
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:09.560]  well sir you told me all fair you were aware of info wars dot com and prison
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:13.800]  planet dot com i will send you today the secret
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:18.920]  department of cemetery document we got in january of 2009

[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:25.720]  confirmed who he was we we interviewed him others
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:28.680]  interviewing i interviewed him all fair we had the reporter on who
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:32.360]  interviewed him with the newspaper dot com in january
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:36.200]  three months before the hype in mexico city began
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:40.040]  they went all over the u.s from california illinois new york and i got
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:45.240]  the bureau of of cemeteries and said millions will die
[1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:50.920]  prepare for martial law now it appears that that was done also in in
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:54.280]  april got secret documents department of health in texas
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:57.640]  where they told him we're really at level six and that the government was
[1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:02.840]  scaring the locals covertly to create this fear
[1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:06.920]  so clearly sir we know before it even popped up
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:11.400]  in mexico that they were hyping this i don't know whether your parliamentarians
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:14.760]  and your parliament whether they are after they should be after this too
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:18.120]  because when we have such when we have such
[1:28:18.120 --> 1:28:22.040]  informations in parliament normally the opposition goes for it
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:25.480]  and the opposition tries to find out and the parliamentarians have the right
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:29.800]  to investigate everything every door has to open if a parliamentarian comes
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:32.840]  and it has to be made obvious we have to see all the files
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:36.600]  this is how we work normally in there in many countries of europe and germany i
[1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:40.120]  did this many times and this should be done and there should be
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:44.920]  investigations and so i think this is a very very big
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:50.840]  and very severe suspicion we must have and so we have to
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:54.840]  to be sure well sir going back to the hoax which you
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:59.160]  you're agreeing and clearly it's a hoax what was the point of the hoax and we
[1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:02.200]  also know again all these different government ministers
[1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:06.440]  in health a lot of them are on the payroll of these companies
[1:29:06.440 --> 1:29:10.760]  i know about some countries that they there were lists there are lists now of
[1:29:10.760 --> 1:29:14.440]  of scientists who advised the minister of health
[1:29:14.440 --> 1:29:19.160]  and those scientists are on the payroll of several companies
[1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.680]  i know this about i have information about french i have information about
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:27.240]  hollanda i have information about the in britain
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:33.240]  so and my colleague he he will from the from the labor party of parliamentarians
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:37.720]  from great britain who will continue to do to have this
[1:29:37.720 --> 1:29:41.560]  auditions done he will invite them and he will try to get
[1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:45.080]  expertise and scientific evidence what really happened

[1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:16.360]  today his website is wodarg.deowdarg very
[1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:20.600]  honored to have him with us he headed up the investigation for the 47 member
[1:33:20.600 --> 1:33:24.680]  health council of europe okay sir tell us now that you've had official
[1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:28.680]  hearings on this new information that you've discovered you also told me during
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:31.800]  the break the connection between bird flu swine flu
[1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:35.640]  secret contracts why that is so important
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:42.280]  yeah we had a personal decision and the WHO representative was there and we
[1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:46.200]  asked them which reasons they had to change the
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:49.800]  definition of a pandemic and he didn't give us
[1:33:49.800 --> 1:33:54.200]  scientific reasons he just told us that the WHO is asking many scientists he
[1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:59.480]  told us the number of scientists about 138 scientists he said they were
[1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:02.920]  asking and after this they had changed the
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:06.760]  definition but when you really when you really see the
[1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:11.000]  the press reports from that time it's from the 19th of May
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.240]  and we asked him this too then you can see that there were
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:21.560]  many member states urging urging the WHO not to use the new definition and
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:26.600]  Mr. Fukuda who is the representative of WHO who was present in Strassburg
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:30.680]  he told us he told those the member states of WHO
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:34.520]  told them yes we will have a deep thought on it but then they met again
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:39.400]  with pharmaceutical industry and they just went on blindly
[1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:45.640]  using this unwanted pandemic definition and this led to spending
[1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:49.880]  enormous amounts of money and this led to unnecessary vaccinations of millions
[1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:54.360]  of people so i think this will be a very
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:59.320]  very severe thing and very acute very activations we have
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:02.920]  against the WHO and against those pharmaceutical companies
[1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:07.640]  doing such an undue influence on the WHO decisions.
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:14.920]  Well Dr. Woodard we know that they paid off ministers we know they
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:18.840]  falsified the pandemic we know they didn't get proper testing of the
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:22.360]  vaccine we know they're making billions of dollars off of this
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:25.320]  we know that bird flu trials killed a bunch of people
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:30.600]  i mean is this not a very serious criminal operation
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:34.520]  that we're investigating? I think we have to stop this
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:38.280]  entering of the private private firms private
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:40.920]  pharmaceutical firms to the public health institution
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:45.560]  they should just be they should just leave this institution they should have
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:49.560]  no influence on the decisions of the agency of the public health
[1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:53.800]  agency which is so important for for protecting us against
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:59.080]  health threats worldwide and this is this shall be one of our
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:03.000]  our goals to to give advice to our governments to
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:08.360]  go to the World Health Assembly and to say that WHO has to change its
[1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:10.920]  rules and that there has to be more transparency
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:15.960]  this will be the result i think of our of our recommendations this will be
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:20.360]  your recommendations to the to the member states
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:23.880]  well we know that in the u.s and europe especially the u.s because i've really
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:27.000]  studied that area perhaps you can fill a sin on europe
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:30.120]  i mean these are very draconian powers and they tried to have forced in
[1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:35.560]  occupations in new york state and massachusetts state
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:39.320]  i saw some european union member states tried to say everyone must take it
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:42.360]  it's the law isn't this a human rights issue
[1:36:42.360 --> 1:36:46.920]  when the government in league with big pharma says you must take this
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:50.120]  experimental shot yes the the council of europe is a human
[1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:53.080]  rights institution and this is why we deal with the matter
[1:36:53.080 --> 1:36:57.560]  because the integrity of of the body and and the right
[1:36:57.560 --> 1:37:01.640]  to health is a very important fundamental right
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:04.840]  which is touched and it should not be touched by
[1:37:04.840 --> 1:37:08.600]  if a doctor just do something because he because he wants to earn money he's
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:11.880]  punished if he doesn't do it for the for the health of
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:15.160]  of his patient but he does it only for his his pocket
[1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:19.160]  so if an institution or if a big institution does decisions
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:23.320]  and for money and it's influenced by people who do it for money
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:27.400]  this is a crime too and i think we have to go after it as a as a human rights
[1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:34.120]  institution and we will do it well sir we appreciate you joining us
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:38.200]  here today my final question is this it's two part
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:42.280]  what is the process on the report any other breaking news that came out of
[1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:45.400]  the preliminary hearings so what is the process any new
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:50.040]  information breaking news you'd like to relate to the world here
[1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:53.480]  and when will the final report come out i think the first
[1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:56.680]  the last question i can answer the first is that
[1:37:56.680 --> 1:38:00.360]  there is no pandemic vaccination necessary we know this now
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:05.640]  rather we are very very sure that it is not necessary so the people were
[1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:09.560]  right in france the people were right in germany not to have this pandemic
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:12.920]  vaccination this is the first and most important thing
[1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:17.720]  and what will be the the result of our investigation
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:25.080]  we see that in many national parliaments we have special investigations
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:28.200]  according to their institutes and their scientists now
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:34.680]  so we have 47 nations 47 parliaments will do investigations and what we do in
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:39.320]  the council of here we will be the platform for exchange of experience
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:42.920]  and we will foster this discussion in the national parliaments
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:47.000]  and we try to feed them with informations we get from WHO
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.840]  and from other institutions we have we are now collect all
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:54.440]  information that we are in this part in the in this period that we collect many
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:57.480]  many informations about single scientists single institutes
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:39:01.800]  where they get their money from and all this is now collected and we
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:06.840]  we get a better and better was a better picture of what had happened
[1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:10.440]  and this will be the this will be the report then
[1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:15.400]  and the recommendations will come out of it well we know
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:19.480]  laws have been broken some crimes have been committed conflict of interest but
[1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:26.360]  if this clear picture is confirmed do you believe that there will be calls for
[1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:31.720]  indictments or criminal investigations or does big pharma have too much control
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:36.440]  there is no law for WHO there is no one who punishes
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:40.360]  those people in WHO we only have national law
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:43.640]  so this is very important that we have collect the information
[1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:48.280]  and on the national level we try to find those people responsible and we try to
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:52.040]  punish them there if they are if they did did something wrong because if we
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:55.000]  don't they're just going to keep doing this over and over again
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:59.240]  again yes this is a but this is the task of the government
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:03.320]  because the government they define the role of the WHO
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:07.720]  it's a contract between the UN nations and the UN nations
[1:40:07.720 --> 1:40:12.120]  as and the governments of those nations they control the work of WHO but it's
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:15.480]  the government it's not the policy will you be able to ever get those secret
[1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:19.560]  contracts we got it in Germany the French got it
[1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:22.760]  and the national parliament are now working to get all the contracts the
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:27.080]  Japanese told me that they had no possibility to retire from their
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:30.680]  contract as we in Germany succeeded to do a little bit
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:34.520]  so we negotiated with the pharmaceutical companies and they let us
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:39.400]  save a little bit money from from those almost 700 million euros they wanted
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.960]  first so it's very very different from nation to
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:47.000]  nation and i just can tell my colleagues and just
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.600]  can ask my colleagues in old parliament go ahead
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:54.600]  have investigations have a deep look we cannot
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:57.800]  to tolerate such a development we cannot have this
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:41:02.120]  the next winter again we don't want such a pandemic
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:05.240]  but the good news is the court of public opinion
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:09.560]  i've seen the numbers this is record numbers of people not buying the hype
[1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:13.320]  who are refusing to take the shots and in the final equation we're going to let
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:17.560]  you go doctor uh who who are the real bad guys big pharma
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:22.200]  and and are you saying the WHO is run by big pharma
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:25.400]  the WHO has opened the door for big pharma and
[1:41:25.400 --> 1:41:28.920]  the big pharma influences the WHO by scientists
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:32.840]  with institutes paid by big pharma scientists are dependent that the
[1:41:32.840 --> 1:41:36.920]  institutes get money from big pharma and the scientists go there
[1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:40.360]  they do the clinical studies for big pharma on one hand on the other hand they
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:43.640]  go to WHO and say you have to buy those pills to
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:47.080]  do such decisions this is what the suspicion is
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:51.000]  and this cannot be tolerated but the public health institutions
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:54.680]  have to be free from influence from economic influence
[1:41:54.680 --> 1:41:58.360]  we it's about our health it's not about business yeah well that's like rick
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.520]  perry our governor saying all girls must take the
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:03.480]  Gardasil shot that they admits killed a bunch of people
[1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:07.320]  and then that wasn't even a law he just recommended it but went on tv and said
[1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:11.240]  it was the law hoax after hoax and it turned out most of his party
[1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:14.440]  got massive money from merc doctor wolf gain
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:21.640]  woe dog we appreciate dr woe dog for joining us woe dog dot de is the website
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:25.720]  w o d a r g we appreciate you and your colleagues
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:30.360]  unanimous investigation unanimously agreeing this is a hoax and a fraud and
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:34.200]  and expanding the investigation we salute your courage sir and we'll
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:37.880]  continue to watch the investigation and the report
[1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:41.480]  thank you very much for your interest take care sir we're very very interested
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:47.240]  thank you there goes dr woe dog now notice
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:51.560]  that they tried to make it mandatory in france and then in states in the u.s
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:57.720]  and this whole thing fell apart because we exposed it because we found out in
[1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:01.720]  january early on that they were planning a flu
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.400]  hoax height we didn't know that would be real we didn't know it would be super
[1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:08.200]  deadly we didn't know there'd be martial law
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:12.280]  we just knew they were hardening all police facilities for martial law in
[1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:17.000]  the name of pandemic megadeth flew millions dead in
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.640]  illinois millions dead in new york state i mean
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:22.520]  these are the documents we got these are the eyewitnesses
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:27.000]  and i went on air in january in february in march and said look for flu
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.360]  and then when it popped up in mexico and they hyped it up
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:34.360]  we said we don't know what's happening but we know they're staging it
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:38.840]  look out and we our website's got hacked we got attacked
[1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:42.680]  and then i really got concerned because these were government level attacks
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:48.040]  and i was like my god this is real but the good news is we exposed the hoax
[1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:50.200]  together you the listeners of this show
[1:43:50.200 --> 1:43:54.520]  and others and we came through this together
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:59.320]  and now they are damaged to where it will be hard for them but obama signed an
[1:43:59.320 --> 1:44:03.480]  executive order for total police state control during a biological attack
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:06.040]  and what he signed that a month ago i guess it was in december a month and a
[1:44:06.040 --> 1:44:08.920]  half ago now and so there are it's hard to believe
[1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:12.200]  we're in the second month of 2010 before we know it'll be
[1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:15.400]  december 31st 2010 and we'll be going into
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:20.600]  2011 and all of this craziness but
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:26.040]  we've got freeway ricky ross coming up
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:29.880]  who was running narcotics for the cia and didn't even find out about it till
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:32.920]  later one of the most famous drug dealers in history
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:35.480]  we're going to talk about a host of issues with free ricky ross
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:38.920]  and then kevin booth pops in halfway through the interview
[1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:43.640]  he is he's interviewed in kevin's film how we won the west
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:46.600]  and that's kevin's title i think it's a great film i consulted on it i would
[1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:50.200]  have called a drug war too this exposes the drug war how they want codex
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:53.800]  alimentaries to restrict and control the vitamins
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:57.720]  it exposes how they're trying to stop medical marijuana it exposes how
[1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:01.720]  87 percent of illegal drug users only use marijuana
[1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:04.920]  and that's why they want to keep marijuana illegal because if they don't
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:08.840]  have that they don't have an excuse for swat teams and prisons and controlling
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:12.040]  us and how the government ships in and launderers the majority of the drugs
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:16.680]  how we'd won the west you can pre-order it it ships in 12 days we have it first

[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:08.280]  for a while now he's writing a big detailed report on this
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:11.560]  i hope he adds the part about all the white house officials
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:17.800]  and uh the five different uh network um
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:21.240]  advisors on military affairs all former generals that famous tape came out
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:24.360]  three years ago well they're saying man we really need another terror attack
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:28.280]  another 9-11 would sure help us and rumsfeld's yeah it's too bad just the
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.920]  public you know i mean they come one hair
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:34.280]  breadth from coming right out and saying they carried out 9-11
[1:49:34.280 --> 1:49:38.280]  yes it's up red alert intelligence chiefs certain
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:43.000]  their bosses will stage terror attack soon and we know the underwear bomber
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.800]  was staged they let him on the plane protecting
[1:49:45.800 --> 1:49:51.080]  us government state departments that we were tracking him totally staged
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:54.440]  and this article is now up on prisonplanet.com you guys print it for me so
[1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:57.720]  i can read it so they're looking across the room when i get back thanks
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:01.160]  we're going to cover this when we come back from break and dovetail it with
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:06.360]  neo con says obama should save presidency by attacking iran this was just
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:10.120]  said yesterday a national review
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:13.080]  and if that didn't stage terror attack i don't know what is and then we have all
[1:50:13.080 --> 1:50:18.600]  these other people in the past uh these different neo cons
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:21.960]  coming out and saying we sure need another 9-11
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:25.640]  so i want to go over uh some of their statements
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:30.680]  as well because these people are just
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:33.960]  devilishly obvious and have such contempt for the public
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:37.880]  they just admit this right out in the open
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:41.800]  and so again uh this is uh stew
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:45.640]  by kofsky writing for the philadelphia daily news i want to remind you of what
[1:50:45.640 --> 1:50:48.680]  he said where they're just right out in the open with their
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:52.440]  game plan if they don't stage terror and launch new wars it's over for them
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:56.520]  but if we expose them ahead of them doing it that'll blow up in their face too
[1:50:56.520 --> 1:51:01.480]  stay with us

[1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:43.800]  this is from prisonplanet.com paul joseph watson
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:47.640]  dissatisfied with their botched efforts of the underwear bombing patsy
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:51.480]  military industrial complex promises to try again
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:54.600]  using information gleaned from the blatantly set up underwear bomber
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:58.040]  patsy intelligence chiefs have assured us that their bosses
[1:54:58.040 --> 1:55:01.080]  will stage another terror attack in the u.s i'm going to play the fox news clip
[1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:05.720]  in the last 30 minutes of the show today within the next three to six months
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:09.880]  and that's their timeline as they mass ships and troops for iran
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:13.400]  according to the nation's intelligence chiefs a terror attack in the united
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:16.760]  states will be likely launched within the next six months reports the wall
[1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:20.600]  street journal abc news has learned some of the
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:23.560]  intelligence has come from accused christmas day bomber
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:27.480]  states the report now they want to x-ray your body with chest x-rays because
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:31.000]  they may have fake breast implants with bombs
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.880]  despite the fact the official story about the christmas day bombing has been
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:37.080]  discredited beyond all recognition the establishment is still
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:41.080]  constantly invoking it is yet another reason for americans to
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:45.240]  obediently line up for naked body scans in fear of what other boogie men
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:48.840]  is being waived in front of their faces this week since federal and state
[1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:52.280]  authorities apparently now consider libertarians ron paul supporters gun
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:54.760]  owners and basically anyone with two brain cells left for
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:58.360]  up together as potential terrorist domestic terrorists
[1:55:58.360 --> 1:56:01.160]  whatever tricks they do decide to pull over the next
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:04.840]  six months will undoubtedly be used to tighten the screws against the american
[1:56:04.840 --> 1:56:08.600]  dissidents they have consistently characterizes extremist threats
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:11.640]  and they're saying they want to start censoring the internet in the name of
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:14.920]  countering this i mean they're moving folks because we're hurting them
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:19.560]  authorities not servants but authorities last week quietly
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:22.440]  reverse the official story about the christmas day underwear bombing attack
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:26.360]  acknowledging that the accomplice was involved despite weeks of denial
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:29.320]  and derision of key eyewitness kurt haskell's description
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:33.720]  of a sharp-dressed man who helped the underwear bomber board flight 253 in
[1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:37.880]  amsterdam to detroit detroit lawyer kurt haskell maintained from the
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:42.440]  beginning that he saw a well-dressed indian man aid the accused bomber to
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:45.640]  board the plane despite the fact that he had no passport and was on a terror
[1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:48.600]  watch list while mutala but was poorly dressed his
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:52.840]  friend was dressed in exquisite suit haskell said he says the man's
[1:56:52.840 --> 1:56:56.280]  the the suited man asked ticket agents whether the underwear bomber could bore
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:00.440]  without a passport this guy he said is from sudan and we do this all the time
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:05.560]  reported michigan live news website fbi just interviewed haskell
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:09.160]  and told him about the sharp-dressed man but officials refused to admit that a
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:13.000]  wider conspiracy was at hand stoically maintaining
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:16.120]  the official story that the underwear bomber acted alone
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:19.640]  authorities claimed that videotapes did not show a second man accompanying
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:22.520]  the underwear bomber and yet they refused to release any footage of the
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:26.280]  alleged bomber there seems little doubt that the
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:29.720]  underwear bomber was at least one accomplice if not more authorities have
[1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:33.160]  remained silent about other eyewitness reports which
[1:57:33.160 --> 1:57:37.720]  described a man intently filming the alleged terrorists throughout the whole
[1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:41.160]  flight a connection that strongly suggests the attempted
[1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:44.040]  bomber was involved in some kind of drill and then his strings were being
[1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:47.640]  pulled by people in more senior positions
[1:57:47.640 --> 1:57:50.040]  then you have the other guy they say they found with a bomb that they jerked
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:54.040]  off the plane it continues hundreds of terror
[1:57:54.040 --> 1:57:58.280]  suspects patsy's and mentally deficient have been convicted in
[1:57:58.280 --> 1:58:01.880]  civilian federal courts including convicted shoe bomber richard reid
[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:05.880]  who attended the finsbury park mosque of north london the finsbury

[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:13.080]  has been working for british security services since 97
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:17.560]  just like the head of the 77 bombings was one of their security service people
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:21.080]  a large number of the supposed terrorists convicted in american courts
[1:58:21.080 --> 1:58:24.520]  were entrapped by fbi and classic how until profession did not have links to
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:30.360]  cia created al-qaeda they entrapped often fuzzy on al-qaeda or what it
[1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:32.600]  represents and then they get into the key
[1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:38.040]  areas here uh where the neocons are calling for some type of staged event
[1:58:38.040 --> 1:58:41.560]  or new war stay with us we'll be right back

[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:44.200]  know you you got a question what's going on here you know when you see
[2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:47.320]  these people uh attacking different countries
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:52.840]  over oil and and you know resources you know it it makes you wonder you know
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:56.200]  what is all this about you know is it really about
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:00.760]  weapons of mass destruction or really just about making somebody's pockets
[2:03:00.760 --> 2:03:05.560]  richer who already have so much money that they're never gonna spend it
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:12.600]  absolutely expanding on that uh ricky expanding on it
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:16.040]  just in a nutshell how did you get into drug dealing how did you get supplied
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:19.160]  by the cia and is it true you were you were
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:23.080]  making profit four or five million dollars a day
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:26.760]  uh yes uh i got into it from a school teacher
[2:03:26.760 --> 2:03:32.680]  turn me on to the drug business uh i started with with absolutely nothing
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:39.240]  125 dollars i was broke um i was making my heyday
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:43.400]  a million to two million dollars every day it wouldn't be a day it was not a
[2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:48.120]  day went by that i wasn't making a million dollars
[2:03:48.120 --> 2:03:53.320]  now was that profit or just uh overall overall wasn't profit it would be uh
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:56.920]  off of a million dollars my profit would be about
[2:03:56.920 --> 2:04:02.280]  200 for dollars now when we come back because we're about to break i want to
[2:04:02.280 --> 2:04:05.720]  go through you know the history briefly for people that don't know most people
[2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:09.640]  do but directly from you know the horse's mouth as they say not from the
[2:04:09.640 --> 2:04:12.760]  media spin that you didn't even discover till
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:16.840]  later you were really being supplied by the cia i want to walk through that
[2:04:16.840 --> 2:04:19.800]  because this is a historical record and then gary webb
[2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:23.000]  they tried to discredit him he had a new book coming out proving he was right
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:26.840]  he's been since vindicated uh he said people been breaking into his house

[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:53.480]  behind the drugs and let's go over your history
[2:09:53.480 --> 2:09:57.640]  well you know alex i started off when i first started selling drugs alex
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:01.880]  believe it or not i had no clue that i was going to become a drug dealer
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:05.080]  no intention is on becoming a drug dealer i was a tennis player
[2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:09.480]  trying to become a tennis pro wanting to go to college first to play tennis
[2:10:09.480 --> 2:10:13.000]  and then wanting to go from there to become a pro
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:17.160]  uh it was a movie came out that first introduced me the first time i ever
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:21.160]  heard about cocaine and then it went from there to a teacher telling me that
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:24.760]  that's how he made his money and that sparked my interest i went
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:30.120]  from being a total novice within five months to being
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:33.160]  you know a player in the drug business making
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:37.720]  you know uh a thousand dollars a day so
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:42.840]  basically i was trapped almost i would say because
[2:10:42.840 --> 2:10:46.120]  you know when i go out and talk to these kids right now i let them know that i
[2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:49.640]  know that today they may be innocent and not involved in drugs or anything
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:53.240]  like that there but tomorrow you know that could change
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:57.880]  with circumstances so that's basically how i got started in it
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:01.880]  of how i find out about that the cia was involved
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:06.920]  i got a call one day from my lawyer my counselor came and got me and said your
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:10.600]  lawyer said he needs to talk to you so when i called my lawyer back it was a
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:14.680]  uh he was telling me about gary he didn't tell me gary's name but he said some
[2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:18.680]  reporters investigating you on form it and he said this guy's a major player i
[2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:22.040]  said well i already knew he's a major player that's why i used to get all my
[2:11:22.040 --> 2:11:25.960]  time from him so uh i don't know how major he was though
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:29.000]  you know i didn't know that he had the ties that that that he had i thought that
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:32.440]  we would just basically you know work in los angeles i didn't know that
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:36.600]  you know he had uh spots up in san francisco oklahoma new
[2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:39.800]  orleans he was basically working the whole country
[2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:44.440]  so uh my lawyer told me he said well uh this reporter wants to come and see you
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:47.160]  i said well i ain't got nothing to lose you know i'm looking at life centers i
[2:11:47.160 --> 2:11:50.760]  ain't never going home and the evidence is it's stacked up pretty good against me
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:54.120]  you know this guy he called me and and tells me that he has 700
[2:11:54.120 --> 2:11:58.280]  kilos of cocaine and he needs to get rid of them and these guys on his back and
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:01.080]  he owes him money and they're gonna do something to him and
[2:12:01.080 --> 2:12:04.600]  would i please help him get rid of you know a couple hundred
[2:12:04.600 --> 2:12:07.240]  you know and i try to explain to him hey man you know i'm out the game i'm
[2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:10.200]  trying to go straight do the right thing you know and uh
[2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:14.600]  you know just just do the right thing now well anyway he he's sweated me for
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:18.920]  six months and finally i broke down and i introduced him to a friend
[2:12:18.920 --> 2:12:23.480]  when i introduced him to this friend da come in and the rest all of us and
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:27.160]  take my friends money who are who i introduced him to and they wanted to burn
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:31.320]  you in hindsight because though previously your big supplier had been the
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:34.360]  cia let's go back though and explain that because
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:37.880]  that later came out in the um dark alliance uh peace
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:41.400]  absolutely give folks the names of these players
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:47.320]  uh and um normanessus denillo blandon denillo blandon is the guy that i dealt
[2:12:47.320 --> 2:12:50.040]  with ten hands you know i saw him every single
[2:12:50.040 --> 2:12:54.200]  day two or three times a day uh normanessus i never remember
[2:12:54.200 --> 2:12:58.520]  staying in but denillo testified on the witness stand that we have been in
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:01.800]  building for a couple times together because you know when i was young i
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:04.120]  was young i wasn't really paying attention to who was the
[2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:07.400]  who's name was what uh i didn't care about the contract
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:11.000]  they were using you as the main front continued right
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:14.840]  basically what the only thing i was really doing Alex was selling drugs i
[2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:18.440]  loved the debt that i was getting drugs so cheap and i could beat anybody's
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:20.840]  price and i could get all the drugs that i wanted
[2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:23.800]  those were my main concerns at that time i didn't care if they was coming from the
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:27.240]  contrast the cia i didn't ask any question
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:31.080]  you know you're taking a guy who was flat broke and you know living in south
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:34.520]  central austin's and now he's out of south central he's has a condo and
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:37.800]  houses and cars you know i'm able to help my family
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:40.680]  those are the things that i was yeah suddenly you're making a million dollars
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:43.480]  a day but the government the banks bringing it in and
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:46.360]  laundering it they're not bad it's it's you that's bad so
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:49.560]  so let me bring us through when you really got the big connections what
[2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:52.680]  year that was when the money really started rolling in
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:58.840]  about 82 which 83 we started making money hand over i mean just i started
[2:13:58.840 --> 2:14:02.200]  making so much money that money didn't even matter anymore it wasn't about the
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:05.560]  money it it got to the point where i was just doing it for the rush
[2:14:05.560 --> 2:14:09.000]  i had more money than i thought i could ever spend uh
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:14.520]  you know i just bought whatever i wanted and how i found out about the cia for
[2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:19.000]  the first time was when when gary was paper because gary didn't let it out
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:21.960]  you know gary didn't tell me what the story was
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:25.960]  he first he wanted to make sure that we want to the same guy that my guy who
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:30.920]  set me up was his guy and uh the next thing i know uh
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:34.600]  after my trial you know gary gary basically questioned
[2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:38.760]  blandone for us he interrogated blandone through my attorney
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:42.760]  and this is the sand this is the san jose mercury news bullet surprise winning
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:46.120]  author right and uh when we did when we were
[2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:48.840]  going to trial gary said right on the first row
[2:14:48.840 --> 2:14:51.880]  and whenever my lawyer would need a question he would always walk back to
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:54.520]  gary and ask me what should i ask him and then
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:59.480]  gary would give him names and and and you know times and dates and all this
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:02.760]  stuff and we couldn't believe where all this information was coming from
[2:15:02.760 --> 2:15:06.760]  so uh gary made the informant say stuff like uh
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:10.840]  Reagan them gave him 18 million dollars to buy a medical surprise
[2:15:10.840 --> 2:15:14.920]  and they took it and bought drugs you know things of that nature came out
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:21.480]  in his testimony so it turns out that blandone and others were working for the
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:25.560]  cia absolutely they're what they call cia operative
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:29.880]  they did not see iasian but but they were
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:35.080]  they were operative meaning that uh they're on a cia payroll but you know
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:38.760]  they don't have green cards so that they can
[2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:44.360]  officially be cia agent and then later people like barry seal who were
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:48.840]  operatives they end up killing them absolutely we we're not sure blandon
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:51.560]  still alive
[2:15:51.720 --> 2:15:54.920]  we don't know where he's at right now go through some more of what came out in
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:58.360]  the trial of what came out in dark alliance when they really wanted to get
[2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:01.880]  web and i talked to his friends and others who said that there were people
[2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:05.640]  breaking in his house everything else and then suddenly all these operatives
[2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:09.240]  came out and said we were liars nobody ever broke in his house even though i had
[2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:12.680]  all these friends that had talked to gary webb i'd interviewed gary webb i'd
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:16.120]  talked to webb about threats he was getting he's got a new book coming out
[2:16:16.120 --> 2:16:19.080]  it totally proving even more i was going to get him on
[2:16:19.080 --> 2:16:22.120]  and then he shoots himself twice in the head with a shotgun
[2:16:22.120 --> 2:16:26.520]  well you know even not not just there but even in the courtroom to hear rest gary
[2:16:26.520 --> 2:16:30.600]  you know the da uh the prosecutor all of them told gary that they were going to
[2:16:30.600 --> 2:16:33.800]  get him you know they didn't want him inside the courtroom oh really tell us
[2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:37.720]  about that as a witness in the court oh well when he was inside the courtroom
[2:16:37.720 --> 2:16:41.400]  they would when he walked outside the hall all of them would be all over me
[2:16:41.400 --> 2:16:44.280]  what the hell are you doing here get out of here you don't know what you're
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:46.360]  doing you don't know what you're talking about
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:49.720]  you're going to get yours i mean just all kind of crazy stuff
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:53.640]  my lawyer would tell me what was going on in the hallway
[2:16:53.640 --> 2:16:56.760]  you know because i couldn't see that but this is the thing that my lawyer was
[2:16:56.760 --> 2:17:00.920]  telling me and also gary had told me some of the things that happened to him as
[2:17:00.920 --> 2:17:04.040]  well well that's like the dc madam i said you're not going to kill yourself
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:07.640]  and she said no and then i said you better watch it and then her landlord
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:10.840]  said people were following her she was fearing for her life she would never
[2:17:10.840 --> 2:17:13.720]  kill herself then they kill her and then they have these
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:17.080]  operatives come out on the news and say she told me she was going to kill
[2:17:17.080 --> 2:17:20.120]  herself look if anybody kills me or kills you
[2:17:20.120 --> 2:17:23.320]  let me let's say it on record i'm never going to kill myself and you're never
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:26.840]  going to kill yourself right right i was just going to tell you that just for
[2:17:26.840 --> 2:17:30.680]  the record addict i love living i'm breathing i want to take a deep breath
[2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:34.600]  right now because i like breathing so much i would never kill myself i don't
[2:17:34.600 --> 2:17:38.600]  care i'd rather go back to prison for life than to be dead
[2:17:38.600 --> 2:17:42.120]  so uh i'm never going to kill myself there's never going to get
[2:17:42.120 --> 2:17:44.920]  anything out here that would make me kill myself
[2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:49.160]  so just for the record ricky ross will never kill himself so

[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:56.120]  aside and if somebody comes out and says you said you were

[2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:49.320]  though attitude it's time we come out of this robotic
[2:18:49.320 --> 2:18:53.960]  state man and and start doing you know they've been spending billions of
[2:18:53.960 --> 2:18:56.680]  dollars on this drug wars man they got they locking these
[2:18:56.680 --> 2:19:00.520]  young kids up for a thousand dollars worth of drugs they give them 20 or 30
[2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:03.160]  years and telling them they can't be rehabilitated
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:07.080]  i can a 19-year-old kid not be rehabilitated because he's sold some drugs
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:11.960]  we'll take rush limbaugh he's was eating a hundred oxycontins a day to let

[2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:31.640]  but if he's taken synthetic heroin that's okay
[2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:36.040]  exactly it's a double standard but if you're not in the end

[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:35.640]  the articles the book gary webb i mean all documented
[2:24:35.640 --> 2:24:39.320]  and do you have any doubt that they murdered him
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:44.600]  man and not in my mind i'm i'm almost positive that they murdered gary webb i
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:48.120]  mean you know he cut so much stuff out he made them tell on
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:50.920]  himself you know the evidence was so clear that you
[2:24:50.920 --> 2:24:55.320]  know even the cia admitted that they knew
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:24:58.360]  that their operatives were selling drugs in this country you know
[2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:02.360]  amy in my situation is that yeah we know
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:07.160]  that these guys are selling drugs but we didn't think in it
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:11.960]  and that's when you know congressman want commerce congresswoman waters came
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:15.880]  back and say well you know that it's your job
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:18.840]  to stop drug dealers from selling drugs in the country
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:24.200]  and you turn the blind off let's get a little doubt let's get a little bit more
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:28.040]  into what happened in your trial the type of stuff that you your lawyer
[2:25:28.040 --> 2:25:33.560]  and gary webb got to come out well we found we found this kind of
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:37.320]  information we thought that that was enough to free me from prison
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:41.000]  you know that that that the cia knew that they're operatives
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:45.320]  because what we tried to do is we try to use the government theory about
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:51.720]  entrapment against them that if you're operative somebody that you're paying
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:55.800]  is selling drugs then that's just like you selling drugs
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:26:00.120]  you know you're connected to this person from the pay so whatever he does
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:03.160]  you're responsible for and we tried to hit him
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:07.880]  from that angle on my appeal you understand what i'm trying to say
[2:26:07.880 --> 2:26:12.120]  oh absolutely i mean clearly and this wasn't even a stanger entrapment
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:15.640]  they were using you to make the money they were using you
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:18.840]  that'd be like of a mafia don gives an order
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:23.960]  to a soldier to go do something the mafia don's more guilty than the soldier
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:28.200]  how do you send the soldier to prison and not the don absolutely and that's
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:31.000]  that's the that's the scenario that we tried to use
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:35.800]  in in in our case in trial that that you know me and alan tried to put together
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:40.440]  uh and we got all that information via gary's investigation you know what gary
[2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:43.720]  put together and and turn in we we turn around and
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:47.160]  use those same documents in court in the federal government
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:50.680]  uh the night circuit court of appeal said yeah okay
[2:26:50.680 --> 2:26:55.320]  they were selling drugs the pa was involved but we're not going to excuse
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:27:01.240]  ricky ross from selling drugs too now a lot of evidence shows
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:04.440]  a lot of evidence shows you've gone completely clean
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:08.680]  and that they set you up because they didn't want you running around out
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:11.560]  there because they knew gary webb had already been talking to you
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:15.160]  well you know what i figured and like you're saying they felt that it would be
[2:27:15.160 --> 2:27:18.920]  better for me to be in prison talking about what
[2:27:18.920 --> 2:27:21.800]  had happened hey it was it was me to my credibility
[2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:25.320]  you know if you got a guy he's from prison and he's saying that the cias
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:28.760]  selling drugs you know oh some wacko from prison
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:32.680]  you know saying all this stuff but if a guy is on the streets
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:35.880]  then it you know it gives him more credibility so they felt that it would be
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:39.160]  much better to have me in prison than to have me uh
[2:27:39.160 --> 2:27:43.720]  out on the streets and the same thing is the government putting pressure on you
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:47.560]  or have you had any veiled or open threats to keep your mouth shut
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:51.320]  no not at this time i haven't nobody has contacted me at all
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:55.720]  uh about anything but you know alex i really don't talk about it much
[2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:59.960]  uh uh anymore uh i just been trying to go on with my life
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:03.240]  and then hopefully uh you know i don't wind up
[2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:07.400]  uh you know in the ocean and nothing like that dear well plus it's an open
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:10.840]  secret they've had congressional hearings documentaries the cover of
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:14.520]  esquire cia aircraft are always crashing full of drugs
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:18.120]  i mean i guess they just don't even care anymore okay we bring the drugs in
[2:28:18.120 --> 2:28:21.400]  your kids use it and we put them in prison right you're not going to people
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:24.040]  not going to do anything you know they understand that they're feeling that
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:28.440]  that i mean we do what we want to do uh we lie about whatever we want to lie
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:31.640]  about any people keep on letting us stay in power and keep on collecting all the
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:35.400]  money you know and and and uh you know i take my
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:38.520]  hat off to gary you know for what he did but
[2:28:38.520 --> 2:28:42.680]  i don't know many people that would put their life on the line like gary did
[2:28:42.680 --> 2:28:46.440]  and knowing that nothing's gonna change and our people are going to
[2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:51.400]  continuously allow our elected officials to continue
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:55.080]  running mockery of our country and he had a new book coming out
[2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:58.600]  with even more damning evidence and now that book didn't get published because
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:00.920]  they shot him twice in the head with a shotgun
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:03.640]  well you know they took the other book they didn't they didn't want to put the other
[2:29:03.640 --> 2:29:05.960]  book out they wouldn't put any promotion behind it
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:09.640]  uh you know they fired him from the news from the news the news station yes
[2:29:09.640 --> 2:29:13.000]  i mean from the newspaper i mean gary gary was catching pretty hell from
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.640]  everywhere you know uh one of my friends jesse catchman heli
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:20.040]  time uh he uh come down and and you know try to
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:24.520]  secretly do an interview with me that i felt was totally
[2:29:24.520 --> 2:29:28.280]  improper you know that i didn't know what was going on
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:32.200]  so you know all of them ganged up on it and and i thought that it was it was
[2:29:32.200 --> 2:29:34.520]  really unfair i thought that they should go and do
[2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:38.680]  an investigation and try to prove that he was right but that's what he's been
[2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:41.400]  proving right but that's why they killed him he had another
[2:29:41.400 --> 2:29:45.400]  book coming out to prove all that good guys get torn down by coventel pro
[2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:47.960]  and that's what they did to gary webb and he wouldn't shut up so they killed him

[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:29.160]  fall the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:33.560]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty

[2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:45.400]  probably the biggest drug dealer in west coast history
[2:33:45.400 --> 2:33:50.040]  who discovered that the cia was why he was getting cocaine cheaper than anybody
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:53.400]  else and they've got similar people all over today
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:57.160]  just like tony montana says in scarface which is based on the composite of
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:33:59.800]  true stories all over stone wrote that
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:02.680]  with with real drug dealers he's sitting there in his hot tub and he's going
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:05.000]  there the banks they've got it all figured out
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:08.520]  they've been here a thousand years they'll be here in a thousand years
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:15.320]  fly pelican and i mean basically basically that's what's going on ladies
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:20.760]  and gentlemen and they use people like ricky ross a real life tony montana
[2:34:20.760 --> 2:34:24.920]  except he's not out murdering people and set him up to get him out of the way
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:27.880]  now uh ricky you know i've thrown out a lot of
[2:34:27.880 --> 2:34:31.080]  questions i have a lot of questions here from twitter but but
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:34.600]  anything else you want to impart to this audience of a couple million people
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:37.960]  what you think is important what you're currently doing before we get into some
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:41.400]  of the listener questions i think that an ounce of prevention
[2:34:41.400 --> 2:34:44.520]  is better than a pound of cure i think that we got to get out here to our kids
[2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:47.560]  we got to start talking to them and we got to start listening
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:50.600]  you know to what they're saying you know i've been visiting a lot of these kids
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:54.840]  these schools in the ghetto and man it's amazing that these kids come up
[2:34:54.840 --> 2:34:58.120]  to me after i finish talking to them and say you know what nobody never told me
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:01.160]  to think like this here you know basically what what what i'm teaching
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:04.040]  them alex is that you have to take something put it in your hand and weigh
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:06.120]  it you know you just don't take everything a
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:10.440]  face value for what the tv says what rappers say or what
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:13.720]  your guy down the street say or what your neighbors say
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:17.880]  you have to be able to think for yourself and analyze every situation for
[2:35:17.880 --> 2:35:21.320]  what it is because when you start letting other people think for you
[2:35:21.320 --> 2:35:24.360]  you're in trouble they're going to take you they're going to use you and you'll
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:29.240]  become their victim on the drug war all the statistics all the
[2:35:29.240 --> 2:35:31.400]  studies european countries that have done it
[2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:36.680]  if we decriminalize drugs on average within a decade drug use drops by more
[2:35:36.680 --> 2:35:39.560]  than half crime and plodes look what happened with alcohol
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:43.160]  prohibition and alcohol kills 300 000 people a year
[2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:46.760]  what is your stance on drug decriminalization
[2:35:46.760 --> 2:35:50.600]  i i totally agree with you that if you take the value out of drugs
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:54.440]  then it will no longer have the attraction that it has right now right
[2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:57.960]  now drug even has an appeal you know how it's right now they treat me like a
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:36:01.000]  rock star out here on the streets you know when i go places
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:04.840]  people come up to me and and hug me they want to take pictures with me i've
[2:36:04.840 --> 2:36:08.680]  probably taken 20 30 000 pictures since i've been on my go to
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:11.960]  usc football games they want to take pictures i go to the lakers games they
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:15.640]  want to take pictures uh when i go to the schools so you
[2:36:15.640 --> 2:36:19.000]  know it's something wrong with that way of thinking you know when when you
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:22.600]  figure that that i was a drug dealer that why would anybody want to take
[2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:25.800]  pictures with a guy like this here it's because
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:29.800]  of the decriminalization it's the laminate goes with it you know you beat
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:33.560]  the system you're different we have to take that kind of
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:37.400]  stuff out of it exactly you take the 500 billion dollars
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:40.600]  a year in the u.s connected illegal drugs out of it
[2:36:40.600 --> 2:36:44.440]  and it will disappear overnight and we can have real communities
[2:36:44.440 --> 2:36:48.120]  and not have these cancers in the community and the system knows that
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:51.880]  that's why they chose the black community to put the cocaine out in it
[2:36:51.880 --> 2:36:55.480]  just like they say in the godfather you know keep it in the colored area
[2:36:55.480 --> 2:36:58.200]  their animals let them lose their souls
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:01.480]  and on top of that Alex look at the prison industry
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:05.080]  they have these guys they put these guys in there 19 years old and give them 20
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:08.760]  years then these guys work 20 years but then on top of that they
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:11.640]  found 25 a hour but then they charge the tax
[2:37:11.640 --> 2:37:15.880]  there 40 000 dollars a year per guy you know take a guy like me they gave me a
[2:37:15.880 --> 2:37:20.040]  life sentence for selling drugs i was going to live
[2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:24.120]  another 50 years so America taxpayers you Alex
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:27.560]  would have been paying 40 000 dollars a year to keep me in prison
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:32.280]  plus my medical bills and then you only feed me beans and rice
[2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:35.640]  where's all this money going you know you got me in a room the size of a
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:39.880]  closet uh the sheets probably only cost a dollar
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:44.440]  where's all the money going Alex who's getting greed from this prison industry
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:47.800]  well that's what's sick Ricky is i know you've studied this being in there for
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:51.160]  more than 20 years but i've looked at it in depth
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:54.840]  the major global private prison industries
[2:37:54.840 --> 2:38:01.400]  are all owned and run by the biggest money laundering drug dealing banks
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:04.440]  ain't that crazy don't they all come together and then the only people that
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:07.800]  can invest in that company you have to be a part of
[2:38:07.800 --> 2:38:12.600]  government judge prosecutor police officer i mean it's like one big family
[2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:16.680]  everybody's benefiting everybody's profanity well that's how they legalize
[2:38:16.680 --> 2:38:20.120]  slavery again they put addictive substances out
[2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:23.400]  that they know people are going to get addicted to they promote it in the
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:27.560]  movies like it's cool and fun and glamorous and when you use it
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:32.120]  they lock you up in their private prison owned by the king pin drug dealers
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:37.880]  Alex you figured that thing out you know better than i do when i live there
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:41.720]  that's exactly the way it works Alex uh i don't know how you did it from out here
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:45.320]  you you're one of the conscious ones but that's what we need the rest of our
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:48.280]  country to wake up to and know that you know we can take that money that we
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:51.880]  pumping into their pockets and start using it to educate our kids
[2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:55.400]  Alex you know i go to those schools and these these schools don't have a basic
[2:38:55.400 --> 2:39:01.960]  book that our kids need to learn it's ridiculous
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:05.240]  it's incredible Ricky i want to bring Kevin Booth up who
[2:39:05.240 --> 2:39:08.840]  has interviewed you and posted it on his sacred cal site uh who's been working
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:12.520]  with you for the last five six seven years in prison
[2:39:12.520 --> 2:39:16.760]  was also working with Gary Webb till he got murdered uh i want to bring Kevin
[2:39:16.760 --> 2:39:21.160]  up with some of his questions or stories about working with you and how great it
[2:39:21.160 --> 2:39:25.400]  is to now have you as a force of truth out on the street
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:29.560]  Kevin is another trailblazer like like Gary man Kevin gets it in Kevin comes out
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:32.680]  here and believe me Alex i worry about him sometimes
[2:39:32.680 --> 2:39:37.240]  he's in south central Los Angeles gangfest in south central Los Angeles
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:41.000]  real Kevin white boy with a camera
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:46.600]  can you believe that when i thought i was like Kevin are you out of your mind
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:51.400]  i can hear Kevin right now uh Kevin you're on with the free Ricky Ross good
[2:39:51.400 --> 2:39:54.200]  to have you here with us hey man i'm gonna practically bring the
[2:39:54.200 --> 2:39:57.560]  tear to my eye to hear to hear Ricky free and talking to you and everything
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:40:01.960]  like that so it's a really great day Kevin tell the story
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:06.280]  you rode back with free Ricky Ross on the greyhound bus for what
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:09.720]  20 hours what was that like 20 hours try practically
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:17.000]  48 hours it's about 30 38 hours um i think Ricky chose the bus ride because
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:19.800]  however long if he flew he would have only gotten out for
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:23.160]  for eight hours to go to the halfway house so he choose the bus trip
[2:40:23.160 --> 2:40:26.360]  so he could at least have 36 hours of freedom
[2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:30.040]  to go to the halfway house so but i think the last time i came on your show
[2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:34.360]  we were all talking about how Ricky had a release date and they
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:37.960]  weren't going to adhere by it and all the the games that they played and
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:42.120]  and uh i heard Ricky mention uh congresswoman waters i like to just
[2:40:42.120 --> 2:40:46.680]  say what a great help she was um she really came to bat for Ricky there at
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:48.840]  the end that's right Ricky they were gonna keep
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:51.800]  you in the slammer yeah they wasn't planning on letting me out
[2:40:51.800 --> 2:40:55.880]  but uh you know you guys stood up and and now i'm here and you know i'm
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:40:59.320]  saying i hope you guys keep me up on your wing now
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:07.240]  you know this country they they hold grudges
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:10.520]  absolutely you were trying to say something when we cut you off Ricky
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:13.960]  i said this uh don't you guys leave me out here by myself you know these people
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:18.280]  they hold grudges and you know i'm gonna continue to do what i do
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:21.480]  but but before kevin started talking you were trying to say something to kevin
[2:41:21.480 --> 2:41:25.320]  do you remember what that was oh uh what was i saying
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:29.480]  oh good good it's on the show kev i can't remember exactly what it was but
[2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:32.920]  you know uh kevin is a trailblazer man he he's out here
[2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:36.440]  you know uh like i was saying he's in south central with his cameras and
[2:41:36.440 --> 2:41:39.160]  sometime i'll be worried about him you know i said man you gotta be careful
[2:41:39.160 --> 2:41:42.760]  going over there kevin i grew up over here so you know they have a little white
[2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:49.240]  guy with a camera over here amazing uh kevin you know there's
[2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:52.760]  so many questions i've asked ricky and i want ricky to i mean talk more about
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:56.280]  his experience in prison before that with the cia
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:00.840]  but kevin any questions you've got for ricky oh you know not really we we we
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:05.000]  talk all the time but um it just you know once again it just it just makes me
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.440]  happy to hear ricky on the show finally and and being able to express
[2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:12.920]  himself so well and uh um i just know i know kevin obviously you talk to ricky
[2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:16.520]  all the time you guys are good friends i'm saying any any interesting questions
[2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:20.840]  for the radio listeners well um you know why don't you
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:24.520]  talk a little bit about the halfway house experience and and you know that
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:28.280]  that whole process that you're forced to go through and how how ridiculous that
[2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:31.800]  was oh oh yeah that's another one halex they
[2:42:31.800 --> 2:42:35.400]  they expect us to go out in the halfway house you know now every place you go
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:38.920]  you got to fill out a job application online right
[2:42:38.920 --> 2:42:43.160]  you would think that the halfway house would have computers right
[2:42:43.160 --> 2:42:49.080]  yes no no computers no cell phones uh you can only go out at a certain time to
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:53.320]  look for a job i mean total bs guess how much they make a day
[2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:59.320]  we're holding the inmate 75 dollars taxpayers money and they and they call
[2:42:59.320 --> 2:43:02.840]  these places halfway house it's a total joke i mean my brother was mentally
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:06.280]  ill and he was in what i would consider a real halfway house their actual
[2:43:06.280 --> 2:43:10.120]  houses when i went to go see this place that they had ricky in
[2:43:10.120 --> 2:43:13.960]  these aren't halfway houses these are like little mini prisons that are like
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:16.840]  just scattered all over our neighborhoods i mean this is like a
[2:43:16.840 --> 2:43:20.280]  little miniature prison it was almost like it's like a high school the size
[2:43:20.280 --> 2:43:25.240]  of a high school with 300 people sleeping there uh and then just in the
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:28.040]  middle of the neighborhood you know it's it's incredible this is like a whole
[2:43:28.040 --> 2:43:32.520]  another scam taking place right under our noses and all the research shows i
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:37.160]  want ricky to speak to this just from personal experience
[2:43:37.160 --> 2:43:40.680]  that when you put large populations of people in prison especially for non
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:44.120]  violent crime they become colleges of crime
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:48.280]  the people now have a record now they're part of the criminal underworld
[2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:51.800]  and this creates more and more crime you know police always
[2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:56.280]  send me emails and say i'm glad we've got more people in prison than china
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:43:59.640]  or the whole e you combine well no i'm not glad
[2:43:59.640 --> 2:44:03.480]  because i know that creates a culture of crime ricky
[2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:07.320]  absolutely you take young guys to come in prison and they only was
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:11.560]  you know buying a thousand dollars worth of drugs now he's with a kingpin from
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:15.000]  columbia or from mexico or with bank robbers
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:18.920]  and these older guys they they they feed off of these young kids
[2:44:18.920 --> 2:44:23.400]  you know like for me i fed off of them too but i was trying to teach them
[2:44:23.400 --> 2:44:26.920]  the things that i've been through but a lot of times in prison
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:30.280]  that doesn't happen that's why they're so concerned right now with terrorism
[2:44:30.280 --> 2:44:33.880]  because they know that they give these young kids so much time alex
[2:44:33.880 --> 2:44:38.120]  you know you give a kid 18 19 years old 20 years in prison
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:44.360]  he's gonna be bitter and it is then i'm sorry and as we discuss in the new
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:48.040]  film how weed won the west there's there's an incarceration rate that
[2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:50.760]  actually the government's own research has shown
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:57.080]  where when we hit a certain level of incarceration it makes crime rates grow up
[2:44:57.080 --> 2:45:00.520]  which is then more police to control more people to make more money
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:04.520]  to put more people in the prisons as the military industrial complex
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:08.840]  absorbs america ricky ross the naked body scanners
[2:45:08.840 --> 2:45:12.520]  they want to put everybody through at airports recording our naked bodies
[2:45:12.520 --> 2:45:15.800]  i mean we're all being trained to be prisoners absolute
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:19.640]  absolute and and if we don't stop it alex
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:23.560]  if we don't stop it we're not going to have any rights you
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:27.320]  you can tap our phones not whenever they want to uh your friends can come and
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:31.640]  record you i mean it's it's ridiculous i mean what is what is america coming
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:37.640]  through are we becoming uh harmony it's amazing ricky again
[2:45:37.640 --> 2:45:41.400]  how do people support what you're doing with your community programs
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:47.480]  well they can donate money to uh to us at freewayenterprise.com they can contact
[2:45:47.480 --> 2:45:51.400]  me on there i have my own email address is rick
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:57.960]  ross r-i-c-k r-o-s-s 90746 at dmail.com i definitely
[2:45:57.960 --> 2:46:00.760]  need help because i'm trying to start programs here in south central for the
[2:46:00.760 --> 2:46:04.680]  kids uh i also need help with my traveling you know
[2:46:04.680 --> 2:46:08.120]  right now i'm i'm putting it out of my check you know when i go across around
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:11.160]  the country uh speaking to kids in different schools
[2:46:11.160 --> 2:46:14.680]  we plan on doing a tour here in california where i go to like 20 schools
[2:46:14.680 --> 2:46:18.520]  and you know just just educate the kids and i would appreciate any help that i
[2:46:18.520 --> 2:46:21.240]  can get and anybody that would like to volunteer to
[2:46:21.240 --> 2:46:25.560]  come out to the schools and support uh would be much appreciated
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:28.840]  and you're explaining to children that the drug culture
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:32.120]  is evil and designed to destroy them correct
[2:46:32.120 --> 2:46:35.640]  absolutely and that just because they feel that
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:38.840]  they're going against the government by selling drugs
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:42.920]  is just what the government have in mind you know they have us thinking that
[2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:46.280]  by selling drugs you're rebelling against the government
[2:46:46.280 --> 2:46:49.160]  but that's exactly what the government wants you to think
[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:52.200]  it's like a reverse psychology thing that they've done to the kids because most
[2:46:52.200 --> 2:46:57.480]  of the kids that get involved with drugs consider themselves rebels
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:01.160]  absolutely and and in truth you're funding the big banks
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:04.840]  and you're allowing them to now have a pretext to control and run your life
[2:47:04.840 --> 2:47:08.440]  and destroy your communities and i'd like to do and i and i've been lucky
[2:47:08.440 --> 2:47:12.680]  enough to to travel with ricky on at least one of the the trips that he went
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:15.400]  to and i just want to say it's uh what an incredible
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:18.680]  effect he has to go to a place like a detention center where you've got a
[2:47:18.680 --> 2:47:22.280]  bunch of teenagers who they won't listen to anybody but when ricky walks in
[2:47:22.280 --> 2:47:25.560]  the room they definitely all shut up and they listen to every word he has to
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:32.840]  say and it's uh really really uh uh quite moving to see it in person
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:37.640]  i've got some questions here um from listeners here's a twitter question
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:41.480]  ricky what other illegal activities was your cia
[2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:45.080]  supplier involved with to give himself credibility
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:49.560]  to hook you in i mean how do they keep you from knowing it was the cia
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:58.600]  gun hand grenade automatic fully automatic weapons machine gun
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:03.720]  so the cia wasn't just bringing in cocaine they were bringing in guns
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:06.760]  absolutely
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:11.800]  unbelievable and then the public gets even more scared
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:15.080]  and they get to get more police to then control the public
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:18.680]  and they got all this firepower you don't remember and then
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:21.560]  and then they need more time remember they they increased the minimal
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:25.080]  mandatory well now we need minimal mandatory so we can put them in prison
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:29.480]  longer because these guys are more violent than they used to be
[2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:33.800]  well you know that's that's come out in florida the cia was supplying and i
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:37.320]  knew in texas but so this cia handler and this came out in
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:42.280]  hearings and in court folks was also supplying weapons
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:46.440]  which was they used to sell me weapons didn't they used to have a front is like
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:50.040]  some sort of car place or something so some sort of car dealership
[2:48:50.040 --> 2:48:53.560]  they had a car dealership they had a security uh
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:57.080]  thing where they did security for different different people
[2:48:57.080 --> 2:49:00.520]  you know they had a bunch of different fronts
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:07.960]  ricky uh so this whole time you were working for them they kept it secret
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:11.640]  that they were cia or did you ever hear that or did you ever wonder
[2:49:11.640 --> 2:49:16.840]  you know i never knew i never had a clue
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:20.200]  only thing that i knew alex is that they were fighting a war
[2:49:20.200 --> 2:49:24.680]  in their country i didn't know that i knew that much about it that's what
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:28.520]  they had told me many times that's why they stole drugs oh so they admitted to
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:32.520]  you that they were funding a war in their country right they admitted that
[2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:35.480]  now where the war was that i didn't know that i didn't know anything about nigger
[2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:42.440]  rock what i knew nothing about contra nor the cia at that time
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:46.360]  did you know how they were getting the drugs into southern california
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:53.000]  nope they wouldn't tell me that well you know he was a racist and a bigot too
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:58.680]  really oh yeah yeah gary found uh a fountain that they had where
[2:49:58.680 --> 2:50:02.360]  where he said just like you said you know give it to to the end
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:05.960]  you know nobody cares what happens to him yo i believe i think there's that
[2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:10.840]  soundbite of of him actually in american drug war where he says you know i hate
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:15.080]  i hate the ends but uh they they have a lot they but they deal in cash so let's
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:18.360]  let's use them exactly what i think you hit it right on the head
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:23.000]  kevin and again folks you can get american drug war and how the weed won

[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:41.720]  that tape had absolutely nothing to do with his testimony
[2:50:41.720 --> 2:50:46.920]  him saying we're dealing drugs to the inwards right and don't nobody care
[2:50:46.920 --> 2:50:49.160]  about them
[2:50:49.800 --> 2:50:53.240]  and that he didn't like them because i never heard the tape because the judge

[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:25.080]  biggest drug dealers in u.s history to be
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:30.120]  ricky ross made 500 million dollars or 500 million conservatively
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:35.240]  went through his hands and he was just one of the larger conduits
[2:54:35.240 --> 2:54:41.240]  to put it on the street they only bust the middle size and small drug dealers
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:44.680]  80 plus percent of illegal drug users only use
[2:54:44.680 --> 2:54:51.640]  marijuana if you decriminalize that it wounds their phony drug war
[2:54:51.640 --> 2:54:55.080]  that the drug cartels controlled by our government
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:55:02.280]  are taken over the planet with if you decriminalize you shut off the cia's
[2:55:02.280 --> 2:55:07.400]  main funding mechanism and the fake war they're using to take over america
[2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:13.240]  your comments on that ricky ross he's talking to he's got guys
[2:55:13.240 --> 2:55:16.680]  talking to him in the background uh ricky
[2:55:16.680 --> 2:55:21.720]  yeah what would it do to the cia if we decriminalized drugs
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:24.840]  oh man it would take a big bite out of their budget
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:29.480]  you know they couldn't no longer raise funds that uh congress and the rest of
[2:55:29.480 --> 2:55:33.240]  the country knows about you know uh with with with illegal drugs
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:36.680]  they can get money that's non-traceable you know nobody knows where it comes
[2:55:36.680 --> 2:55:40.680]  from nobody knows that this person was paid off or that person was paid off
[2:55:40.680 --> 2:55:44.920]  you know it's just free money three weeks ago ron paul gave a speech
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:48.280]  documenting that the cia has had a coup in america
[2:55:48.280 --> 2:55:54.040]  and already runs our country yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't doubt that i
[2:55:54.040 --> 2:55:59.000]  believe that that's probably true i mean because the people are not standing up
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:04.120]  you know and until the people take charge you know somebody's gonna run it
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:07.480]  and you know the people with money you know that's what they want money for it
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:11.720]  to run but it's so obvious the criminal elements in government
[2:56:11.720 --> 2:56:15.480]  made drugs illegal because their alcohol prohibition had ended
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:19.800]  then they wanted a new black market to take over with
[2:56:19.800 --> 2:56:24.280]  i agree i totally agree with that and and drugs was a perfect uh
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:29.880]  venue for that and we're now 70 plus years in the drug war and the bigger the
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:32.520]  drug war gets ricky the more drugs we got on the
[2:56:32.520 --> 2:56:36.760]  street why is that well i mean it's like this here
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:41.320]  alex there's no way that that they can win this drug war drugs
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:44.680]  if somebody wants to get high alex they're gonna get high you know
[2:56:44.680 --> 2:56:48.680]  a guy od when i was in the hall at a maximum security prison
[2:56:48.680 --> 2:56:54.520]  a guy od in the hall he's in a cell by himself no other inmate contact
[2:56:54.520 --> 2:56:59.240]  how did this happen how could he be in the hole in od the jail guards are
[2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:03.400]  selling him the drugs exactly somebody's gonna get it
[2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:07.400]  to him and usually it's the people of authority
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:10.200]  which is why they want to keep it illegal and they want to get
[2:57:10.200 --> 2:57:12.760]  50 of kids according to the new freedom initiative
[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:16.920]  on prozac and ritalin which are even more dangerous than other narcotics
[2:57:16.920 --> 2:57:22.120]  yeah i totally agree and a lot of those drugs and it's been proven to that
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:24.520]  children who take those drugs at an early age
[2:57:24.520 --> 2:57:27.800]  will be more susceptible to becoming addicted to things like
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:32.680]  uh crystal meth cocaine crack and and on and on well it's so obvious and it's
[2:57:32.680 --> 2:57:35.240]  the government is a bunch of drug dealing crooks
[2:57:35.240 --> 2:57:38.280]  who want to make us all drug addicts well the only thing we can do is
[2:57:38.280 --> 2:57:41.880]  decriminalize now look at mexico collapsing ricky ross because of the
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:46.040]  drug war exactly and the drug lords run the country
[2:57:46.040 --> 2:57:49.800]  because they have all the money they're draining all the money out of the out
[2:57:49.800 --> 2:57:51.960]  of the economy and the same thing has happened in

[2:58:01.160 --> 2:58:05.960]  yeah nobody wins from a drug war i'm totally convinced of that it's no way
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:10.840]  that anybody wins except the authority the bankers
[2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:16.120]  and the banker what are the authority they're gonna continue to push this uh

[2:59:56.760 --> 3:00:09.000]  alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:16.600]  freewayinterprises.com freewayinterprises.com ricky ross is
[3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:20.680]  our guest will put his website up on screen for prison planet
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:24.440]  dot tv viewer so they're on the web they'll know the bona fide
[3:00:24.440 --> 3:00:31.480]  ricky ross website really is a pop legend and we just appreciate that he's
[3:00:31.480 --> 3:00:35.640]  here with us fighting the new world order exposing the drug war for what it
[3:00:35.640 --> 3:00:40.200]  is because in how we'd won the west that we're selling an info wars.com
[3:00:40.200 --> 3:00:43.960]  kevin went and interviewed street drug dealers that do not want the marijuana
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:47.640]  dispensaries they do not want to decriminalize
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:51.320]  you know the ground level drug dealers not just a marijuana but other more
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:55.240]  hardcore drugs they want to keep it illegal don't they ricky
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:00:59.160]  absolutely i mean when you when you start legalizing you cut into their
[3:00:59.160 --> 3:01:03.080]  money and they don't want that to happen
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:07.480]  kevin as you as you're saying earlier that you know 80 of all illegal drug
[3:01:07.480 --> 3:01:11.960]  users only smoke marijuana so if you take all those people and they
[3:01:11.960 --> 3:01:15.800]  start going to these illegal dispensaries then you're you're destroying
[3:01:15.800 --> 3:01:19.400]  the whole market for all sides of the fraud
[3:01:19.400 --> 3:01:21.080]  um
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:24.680]  when you take all that money out of it you you also take the violence out
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:28.360]  because most of the violence comes from people trying to rob the people with all
[3:01:28.360 --> 3:01:32.440]  the money because it costs so much and they can't legally
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:36.200]  get it and this is well known the british took down china
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:39.960]  on record by bringing opium in the government had it illegal
[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:43.160]  they brought it in bought off the cities took over the whole country
[3:01:43.160 --> 3:01:47.560]  and then broke china up in 11 pieces the globalist are doing this now
[3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:51.240]  cia got caught in vietnam bringing in the opium
[3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:56.520]  ricky ross look at afghanistan now it's 13 times the previous record level
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:01.080]  of heroin pouring out into the world with the cia and the pentagon openly
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:04.440]  protecting it i saw that on the news a few times a
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:08.040]  couple years ago how since we went over and took over the country that it's
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:11.480]  gotten worse i mean that's just another example
[3:02:11.480 --> 3:02:14.760]  but now what are we going to do we have to always just go sit around our people
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:18.200]  going to stand up and and and take the white house back
[3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:21.880]  i did right now here in los angeles they're trying to shut down the thousand
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:25.000]  legal dispensaries we have they're trying to get it down to like 70 or
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:29.240]  something which is going to create this incredible consolidation and make
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:32.200]  some of the dispensaries are you know it's going to drive the price it won't
[3:02:32.200 --> 3:02:34.440]  be able to supply the market and then the
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:36.920]  the illegalness will continue and the crime will continue
[3:02:36.920 --> 3:02:40.760]  ricky you're talking about education too the the hundreds of billions in the
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:45.560]  fake drug war into education absolutely i mean if we educate the people then
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:49.080]  they won't need to go out and use drugs most people that use drugs are
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:52.200]  uneducated kevin you're going to have a screening of
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:56.280]  how weed won the west which isn't out until the 15 ships here on dvd
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:02:59.960]  and info wars dot com you are having a viewing tell folks real fast right this
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:04.360]  is at the organica dispensary that's actually in the film it gets busted in
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:08.200]  the film and this is on a saturday february 13th around
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:13.000]  seven p.m it's in venice beach on a one three four five six
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:16.200]  washington boulevard in venice organica dispensary
[3:03:16.200 --> 3:03:21.160]  february 13th all right and what's worse is these are legal under state law but
[3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:24.600]  the feds come in and beat them up and smash and then steal the money in the
[3:03:24.600 --> 3:03:27.720]  weed and you never even hear where it went i mean the feds
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:34.120]  are so corrupt and the locals are doing it now they just openly keep the money
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:37.720]  yeah i mean it's uh it's in your face that's all you can say
[3:03:37.720 --> 3:03:41.480]  ricky last question from your deep research on this i mean just experiencing
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:44.760]  it what percentage of cops on average would you say are crooked they're
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:48.040]  involved in narcotics oh man it's so many of you know my whole
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:52.200]  task force you know i took down 35 crooked cops they were robbing us
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:55.640]  planting drugs on us you know they came up with a game that if they come in your
[3:03:55.640 --> 3:03:58.680]  house and you have a bunch of money the easiest way to get you not to claim the
[3:03:58.680 --> 3:04:01.720]  money is to plant some drugs on you know because drug dealers that stop
[3:04:01.720 --> 3:04:05.000]  keeping money and drugs in the same house because they knew that if they
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:08.280]  didn't have any drugs there the money was okay yeah that's something
[3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:11.000]  something we didn't go into is the ricky ross task force and the fact that
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.880]  some of the guys on the ricky ross task force are still in jail
[3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:17.640]  look look we're out of time but ricky i want to have you back up just to tell

[3:08:46.280 --> 3:08:50.600]  rifle munitions not just abrams tank sabo rounds or
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:57.480]  vulcan warthog cannons in a 10s or in hellfire missiles it's being put into
[3:08:57.480 --> 3:09:01.320]  most munitions now and the troops are dying
[3:09:01.320 --> 3:09:04.520]  they've known for decades it's causing deformities
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:08.360]  just like they knew in secret reports that have been declassified recently
[3:09:08.360 --> 3:09:12.840]  in the 60s that agent orange was going to literally fry the testicles of men
[3:09:12.840 --> 3:09:18.280]  and make them have a deformed children and uh i mean this is what's going on
[3:09:18.280 --> 3:09:20.680]  we're going to talk to dr dug rocky here in a moment
[3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:26.120]  who literally wrote the army manuals for them on du they know what they're
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:28.360]  doing they don't care about our troops
[3:09:28.360 --> 3:09:31.160]  they say caring about the troops is putting them in all these fraudulent
[3:09:31.160 --> 3:09:34.840]  wars so i want to get into what du's doing the iraqi government suing the
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:37.720]  us over this and we haven't talked to dr rocky

[3:11:54.280 --> 3:12:01.480]  okay going to dr dug rocky what this evil system does
[3:12:01.480 --> 3:12:05.400]  is it uses its authority of the government the system
[3:12:05.400 --> 3:12:08.440]  to do outrageous things and then just set the precedent
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:12.200]  government's caught drug dealing literally thousands of times the drug war
[3:12:12.200 --> 3:12:15.400]  continues but though people are starting to wake up
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:19.560]  the government's caught engaged in all forms of corruption the banks are
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:22.920]  robbing as they just continue the the vaccine makers are caught
[3:12:22.920 --> 3:12:27.480]  maiming people the corruption continues the du
[3:12:27.480 --> 3:12:33.080]  being used all over the world now and improving grounds all over the us so
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:36.200]  incredibly deadly and they knew in the late 40s it was deadly
[3:12:36.200 --> 3:12:39.640]  they knew in the 80s and the early 90s when dr dug rocky wrote
[3:12:39.640 --> 3:12:43.560]  the book the manual for the pentagon in the army they
[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:46.760]  knew how deadly it was and now they just say look
[3:12:46.760 --> 3:12:50.440]  when we attack a military base in iraq or somewhere we move troops in a week
[3:12:50.440 --> 3:12:54.360]  later have a move right in next to blast points with the du
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:12:57.880]  we have people without protective gear clearing up tanks and stuff we destroyed
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:00.360]  with it knowing it's going to really hurt them
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:04.200]  and it's hurt dr rocky many of his colleagues have died just involved
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:08.200]  in studying this stuff and in cleanups so this
[3:13:08.200 --> 3:13:11.160]  gives you a window into the minds of the controllers
[3:13:11.160 --> 3:13:16.520]  dr dug rocky is a depleted uranium expert a bs in physics at the western
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:20.040]  illinois university followed by his ms and phd in physics and technology
[3:13:20.040 --> 3:13:23.240]  education university of illinois his military career has spent four
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:27.160]  decades to include combat duty during vietnam and go for one
[3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:30.920]  he served as a member of the third u.s army medical commands nuclear biological
[3:13:30.920 --> 3:13:34.200]  chemical teaching medical response and special
[3:13:34.200 --> 3:13:37.480]  operations team third u.s army captured equipment project
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:41.480]  team with the third u.s army put uranium assessment team gulf war
[3:13:41.480 --> 3:13:45.000]  operation desert storm this thing's five pages long folks
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:49.080]  he was the u.s army's depleted uranium project director from 94 to 95
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:52.280]  he developed a congressionally mandated education training manuals and wrote the
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:58.360]  u.s army regulation 700-48 the u.s army pam 700-48 and the
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:02.760]  u.s army's command task for du incidents he is the du expert and they
[3:14:02.760 --> 3:14:05.640]  won't even allow the manuals to be given to officers and troops
[3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:09.560]  they march them in to die that's who your government is
[3:14:09.560 --> 3:14:13.640]  so don't give me when i'm against new wars that i don't care about the troops
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:17.240]  killing our troops isn't taking care of them and the murderers that run this
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:20.440]  system wrap themselves in our troops heroism i'm
[3:14:20.440 --> 3:14:24.280]  sorry i'm ranting dr rocky and i want you to get out the websites every i mean i
[3:14:24.280 --> 3:14:28.040]  literally didn't even get into your bio here there's so much but
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:32.280]  just to watch this evil set the precedent and i mean what is it like for
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:36.760]  you to see this the use of du uh going wild
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:41.080]  well i mean it's a continuous thing considering that the united states army
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:45.240]  friendly fire casualties from operation desert storm
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:50.040]  who became casualties as the direct result the use of uranium mission
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:54.440]  fired by military personnel against our own military personnel
[3:14:54.440 --> 3:14:57.240]  to this day have still not got the medical care that
[3:14:57.240 --> 3:15:00.920]  i ordered as a theater health businesses that was ordered
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:04.920]  by the theater medical commander uh den general dz zeus and desert storm
[3:15:04.920 --> 3:15:09.320]  1991 and it's still not being provided and today what
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:13.560]  bothers me the most is general irish and seckie is now
[3:15:13.560 --> 3:15:16.600]  the secretary of the u.s department of veteran affairs
[3:15:16.600 --> 3:15:20.280]  he wrote the original order mandated medical care environment cleanup of
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:23.800]  training in 1993 he signed the army regulation
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:27.240]  that i wrote that you already quoted and we're not getting the care
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:30.600]  that we earned it's the real simple they just
[3:15:30.600 --> 3:15:34.520]  do not want to provide medical care to u.s military personnel
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:38.360]  because you have to understand the million are so casually we have now from
[3:15:38.360 --> 3:15:42.200]  the nonsense of the person golfer not as a result of bullets and bombs
[3:15:42.200 --> 3:15:47.080]  they are the result of toxic exposures primarily uranium emissions
[3:15:47.080 --> 3:15:51.400]  oil well fires pesticides hazardous materials and everything else
[3:15:51.400 --> 3:15:55.320]  and blowing up camicia the one of the biggest chemical weapons dumps in the
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:59.240]  world and they know and they just don't care but you have to understand
[3:15:59.240 --> 3:16:02.920]  camicia was only one that we blew up we blew up 105 of them
[3:16:02.920 --> 3:16:06.200]  we made the decision to blow up all the chemical and biological weapons
[3:16:06.200 --> 3:16:10.680]  facilities that iraq possessed in december of 1990
[3:16:10.680 --> 3:16:15.800]  and that was because we the u.s military and specifically the u.s army gave them
[3:16:15.800 --> 3:16:20.040]  anthrax weaponized anthrax so we had destroyed the place
[3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:23.240]  and if anybody has any question as whether or not we did it or not all they
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:27.000]  have to do is go to general norman sports pop autobiography
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:30.680]  it doesn't take a hero and go to page 390 and read about it
[3:16:30.680 --> 3:16:34.920]  the arrogance of these guys is beyond comprehension
[3:16:34.920 --> 3:16:38.840]  and then they did the brain studies from the chemical weapons killing troops in
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:41.160]  mass when you talk about a million casualties
[3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:45.880]  break that down for us well when we look at a million casualties what we are
[3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:51.480]  seeing that's right now for example cbs news 60 minutes did a story on this on
[3:16:51.480 --> 3:16:55.800]  january 3rd and they you know they broadcasted and paula god bless paul
[3:16:55.800 --> 3:16:59.720]  sullivan from vet for common concern you know common sense he was the one that
[3:16:59.720 --> 3:17:03.240]  pushed that through but what cbs news 60 minutes
[3:17:03.240 --> 3:17:06.920]  confirmed on january 3rd and their story was
[3:17:06.920 --> 3:17:11.320]  delayed deny and wait till i die in other words
[3:17:11.320 --> 3:17:14.840]  what we will do the military and the apartment defense and the va will do
[3:17:14.840 --> 3:17:18.440]  will deny any correlation between all the adverse health and environmental
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:21.400]  effects from all these toxic exposures specifically
[3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:25.560]  uranium emissions deny medical care for delay any
[3:17:25.560 --> 3:17:29.160]  treatment that you do get if you are lucky to get it
[3:17:29.160 --> 3:17:33.480]  and just wait till you die and the number of family members
[3:17:33.480 --> 3:17:36.840]  and everybody else and the soldiers involved in everybody
[3:17:36.840 --> 3:17:41.640]  they never stopped calling for help it's every day it never the deformities
[3:17:41.640 --> 3:17:47.720]  of the troops their children the deformities of the iraqis the serbs
[3:17:47.720 --> 3:17:52.280]  the afghans and and i know you've got the numbers on this but is it not an
[3:17:52.280 --> 3:17:56.200]  exponential increase year to year in the mount of du being
[3:17:56.200 --> 3:18:00.200]  being being served out by armories incredible amount i mean the united
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:03.720]  state gives us stuff away to anybody and everybody that will take it and then we
[3:18:03.720 --> 3:18:08.200]  use it against all known targets i mean during desert storm we use it against
[3:18:08.200 --> 3:18:11.160]  the armor effectively all the tanks and the you know trucks and
[3:18:11.160 --> 3:18:14.120]  everything else but we also shot up the bunkers and
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:17.240]  everything else and then with operate when we went into
[3:18:17.240 --> 3:18:21.160]  balkans in 1994 we shot up buildings and everything
[3:18:21.160 --> 3:18:25.800]  again in the balkans in 1991 this is in the old uslavia
[3:18:25.800 --> 3:18:29.720]  in pekta abiso who was head of the united nations he actually told the u.s
[3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:33.480]  department of defense to clean up all of these facilities they shot up
[3:18:33.480 --> 3:18:36.600]  and then we continued operation iraqi freedom and enduring freedom in
[3:18:36.600 --> 3:18:40.920]  afghanistan and iraq we have literally with uranium emissions and i've got
[3:18:40.920 --> 3:18:44.280]  total video total reports we've got all of this stuff no questions
[3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:48.600]  photographs shot up apartment buildings hospitals
[3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:52.280]  water treatment facilities sewage sanitation plants
[3:18:52.280 --> 3:18:55.800]  plus all the you know cars and trucks you could ever imagine
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:19:00.040]  and this stuff is so extraordinarily effective they talk about it originally
[3:19:00.040 --> 3:19:02.920]  when it was used for armor but it's far more effective against a
[3:19:02.920 --> 3:19:07.080]  conventional house or an apartment building or a water facility than it
[3:19:07.080 --> 3:19:12.280]  is against the tank because if there ain't any tanks left to shoot
[3:19:13.560 --> 3:19:17.640]  and and then our troops move into the areas they've blown to bits
[3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:21.000]  that's correct our troops move in and then they're not even provided the
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:25.240]  mandatory respiratory and skin protection that is required by the us army
[3:19:25.240 --> 3:19:28.440]  regulation and the u.s technical bulletin provides all the
[3:19:28.440 --> 3:19:32.040]  specifications but more important the fact that our
[3:19:32.040 --> 3:19:34.840]  department of defense the british ministry of defense
[3:19:34.840 --> 3:19:37.640]  the canadiens and australians and the israelis
[3:19:37.640 --> 3:19:40.920]  i mean you have to understand those are the five countries that use this
[3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:45.880]  they use it without hesitation completely and totally disregard
[3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:50.200]  what the specifications are stay there dr rocky i mean basically you might as
[3:19:50.200 --> 3:19:53.320]  well after our troops have had a war line them all up and shoot them
[3:19:53.320 --> 3:19:57.080]  and that's the equivalent of this but when they come home and die
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:19:59.880]  all the people seeing in god bless america they don't want to talk to them
[3:19:59.880 --> 3:20:03.720]  just get in the coffin shut up men are you thinking about the health of your

[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:26.040]  jones so twitter.com forward slash real alex jones
[3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:29.880]  going back to dr doug rocky one of the top experts in the world on du even
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:35.000]  according to the pentagon who he worked for. Dr rocky
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:38.120]  let's talk about the real health effects in the studies and what they've known du
[3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:41.080]  does and now it's a toxic byproduct of spent
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:45.160]  fuel rods from nuclear reactors but but more importantly i want to ask you now
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:49.720]  about the mindset of the elite i mean they had du in the 40s and 50s
[3:24:49.720 --> 3:24:52.600]  and there were i saw papers where they talked about it as a weapon and they
[3:24:52.600 --> 3:24:55.960]  said we can't use it because it kills our own personnel and people that move
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:59.160]  into the areas what changed in the mindset
[3:24:59.160 --> 3:25:03.080]  where they wouldn't use it in the 50s 60s and 70s and now it's just
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:06.200]  we're going to use it at local shooting ranges for the military
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:09.400]  we're going to use it in hawaii we're going to use it in portorico
[3:25:09.400 --> 3:25:12.920]  we're going to tell the troops it's okay and watch them die i mean this is
[3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:16.600]  psychopathic murder yes it is it's just the fact
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:20.360]  that they made the decision that uh human life had no value
[3:25:20.360 --> 3:25:23.640]  that animals had no value that food has no value
[3:25:23.640 --> 3:25:27.400]  and they just made a conscious decision and i've been fighting this insight
[3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:31.560]  it did all the research for them the nevada test site wrote the directives
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:35.560]  they just don't care but as you said the health and environmental
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:39.400]  effects all this has always been known i mean my own medical care for my
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:43.000]  depleted uranium exposures because of my assigned duties one of the things i
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  forced it with was the original 1973 report
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:50.680]  on the use of uranium emissions by israelis against the egyptians
[3:25:50.680 --> 3:25:55.000]  in the Sinai and all of that stuff was known then it was documented there in
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:58.040]  the official reports again these are not classified
[3:25:58.040 --> 3:26:00.920]  but they just totally there and they totally ignored
[3:26:00.920 --> 3:26:04.760]  prior to operation iraqi freedom and enduring freedom
[3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:09.400]  colonel j. edgar wakiyama who's the director of the department of
[3:26:09.400 --> 3:26:13.240]  operational testing evaluation command gave a briefing to all the senior
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:17.000]  generals and everybody in the pentagon upon depleted uranium how it works what
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:19.800]  it is the fact that the munitions as you said go
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:24.040]  all the way down to the m16 rifle 50 cal everything all the way up
[3:26:24.040 --> 3:26:28.360]  but in this briefing he stated very specifically i'm going to quote very very
[3:26:28.360 --> 3:26:33.560]  specifically depleted uranium munitions
[3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:39.800]  when used okay they emit alpha beta and gamma particle
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:43.240]  next race the alpha particle taken inside the
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:46.200]  body in large doses this hazard is due to cell
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:52.040]  cell damage and cancer quote lung cancer is well documented
[3:26:52.040 --> 3:26:56.200]  we continue on beta particle hazards the skin and the lens of the eye
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:26:59.960]  now personally i've learned that because of all my radiation cataracts and
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:03.320]  the other problems with the eyes and everybody else is recording it
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:08.200]  it continues on very very well i mean very very direct
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:14.600]  and says d was chemically toxic we look at all the stuff we have total
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:18.680]  confirmation quote urine samples containing uranium our mutagenic as
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:23.560]  determined by the aim step the culture human stem bone cell line with you
[3:27:23.560 --> 3:27:26.840]  also transform the cells that become carcinogenic
[3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:30.440]  that's the reason why we're seeing so incredible levels i mean incredible
[3:27:30.440 --> 3:27:34.680]  levels leukemia and these all these young kids coming back from desert
[3:27:34.680 --> 3:27:39.000]  storm but we're also seeing leukemia and the children the offspring of those
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:42.760]  were exposed during deserts because just like for i the
[3:27:42.760 --> 3:27:45.400]  particle so small doctor correct me if i'm wrong
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:49.720]  it precipitates into the bone that's correct it can't there's nothing there
[3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:52.440]  is no respiratory skin protection that'll work
[3:27:52.440 --> 3:27:55.640]  even though when we did all this worse work for the military the department
[3:27:55.640 --> 3:27:59.480]  energy gave us their best respirators the army gave us their best respirators
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:04.520]  it went through it like a open barn door it absolutely does it one of the big
[3:28:04.520 --> 3:28:07.640]  problems quote from the walkie i'm a briefing i'm going to read this because
[3:28:07.640 --> 3:28:10.360]  it's astonishing they know and they disregard it
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:15.320]  the three major rocks of human exposure to d u r wounded by shrapnel
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:19.320]  inhalation lung and thoracic lymph nodes ingestion
[3:28:19.320 --> 3:28:23.400]  most among children plain and eating contaminated soil
[3:28:23.400 --> 3:28:26.680]  and contaminated drinking water and food in the community
[3:28:26.680 --> 3:28:31.800]  and quote that is what we're seeing throughout iraq and that's from what year
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:36.040]  pardon me what year was that report this is a briefing to the senior pentagon
[3:28:36.040 --> 3:28:39.640]  leadership in 2002 before the start of operation iraqi
[3:28:39.640 --> 3:28:42.760]  freedom and during and again i'm going from memory interviewing you and others
[3:28:42.760 --> 3:28:45.960]  and reading mainstream news but i saw reports in the 50s
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:49.240]  it was a secret weapon they were only going to use of the russians
[3:28:49.240 --> 3:28:53.160]  flooded into eastern europe but they said we still don't advise because it
[3:28:53.160 --> 3:28:57.880]  ruins the area for billions of years i mean they know
[3:28:57.880 --> 3:29:01.480]  this it's just so incredible and they know
[3:29:01.480 --> 3:29:04.920]  i mean i see the numbers of troops coming back and dropping dead and getting
[3:29:04.920 --> 3:29:08.040]  cancer and getting leukemia and other blood cancers
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:11.480]  and they know it's killing them i mean this is we ought to make all these
[3:29:11.480 --> 3:29:15.720]  generals go into the proving grounds and snort a line
[3:29:15.720 --> 3:29:19.720]  of d u if it's so good when i specifically talked to the generals
[3:29:19.720 --> 3:29:22.360]  from washington dc as i've done in the last few weeks
[3:29:22.360 --> 3:29:25.800]  and they asked them very specifically for help in getting medical care and
[3:29:25.800 --> 3:29:29.400]  viral remediation they just say go to your kind spend the
[3:29:29.400 --> 3:29:33.160]  senator we're not going to help you
[3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:36.680]  and i noticed those troops troops have told me and i've seen the news the
[3:29:36.680 --> 3:29:40.360]  generals won't stay in these bombed out buildings like they tell the troops to
[3:29:40.360 --> 3:29:43.320]  and notice none of these generals want to stay in iraq very long
[3:29:43.320 --> 3:29:47.000]  dr rocky long segment coming up roll through the documents for people
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:49.880]  because all you folks out there that claim you love the troops so much and
[3:29:49.880 --> 3:29:55.960]  stick american flags on your we're on the march the empires on the run
[3:29:55.960 --> 3:30:00.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:04.680]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[3:30:04.680 --> 3:30:08.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[3:30:08.680 --> 3:30:12.440]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:30:12.440 --> 3:30:16.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:30:16.040 --> 3:30:20.280]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:30:20.280 --> 3:30:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[3:30:23.960 --> 3:30:28.360]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[3:30:28.360 --> 3:30:32.280]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[3:30:32.280 --> 3:30:35.880]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:39.720]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:43.240]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[3:30:43.240 --> 3:30:46.440]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[3:33:49.560 --> 3:33:55.400]  headline on a philadelphia daily news one month after the anniversary i'm
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:33:57.640]  thinking about another nine eleven would help america
[3:33:57.640 --> 3:34:03.480]  i mean that's uh stew by kovsky these are bizarre people right out in the open
[3:34:03.480 --> 3:34:07.480]  now i got cut off by the break i usually nail it but i
[3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:10.680]  i went over i was trying to make the point that all these people that stick
[3:34:10.680 --> 3:34:14.600]  stickers on their cars and talk about how much they love the trips
[3:34:14.600 --> 3:34:18.920]  they just like to go to football games put their hand on their heart and cry and
[3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:23.640]  to them patriotism's war wars more death more tyranny more enslavement
[3:34:23.640 --> 3:34:27.640]  uh i mean it must be because du is well known
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:30.680]  it's killing our sons and daughters it's killing the people
[3:34:30.680 --> 3:34:34.280]  the innocent people we bomb with it years after
[3:34:34.280 --> 3:34:39.960]  dr rocky i mean what's the half life of depleted uranium how long is it deadly
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:44.120]  longer than the age of the earth i mean one half life is 4.5 billion years and
[3:34:44.120 --> 3:34:47.800]  you have to go through 10 half life so that's 45 billion years even think about
[3:34:47.800 --> 3:34:51.640]  it being safe radiologically so 45 billion years and
[3:34:51.640 --> 3:34:54.680]  last number i had was at least 10 proving grounds
[3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:58.760]  in the u.s are using this just all over the place and they've just gotten to the
[3:34:58.760 --> 3:35:01.720]  point where they don't even tell the troops there's any danger that's
[3:35:01.720 --> 3:35:04.680]  correct but one of the most and we talked about this for
[3:35:04.680 --> 3:35:09.880]  on the 18th of april of 75 hardly a man has left alive our nation was born at
[3:35:09.880 --> 3:35:15.560]  concord massachusetts in 1775 concord massachusetts is the
[3:35:15.560 --> 3:35:19.480]  site of the star met depleted uranium emissions plant that's been closed
[3:35:19.480 --> 3:35:23.960]  and it has incredible environmental and medical disasters as a consequence of
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:27.000]  that and when you look at what's happening it
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:31.320]  goes back and again here is the direct quote from the wakama briefing for the
[3:35:31.320 --> 3:35:34.760]  emerging environmental concerns include quote a
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:39.160]  significant exposure to depleted uranium on children's plane and impact sites
[3:35:39.160 --> 3:35:44.680]  by ingesting heavily contaminated soil slowly to depleted uranium the local
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:48.920]  local water supplies for years and consuming depleted uranium contaminated
[3:35:48.920 --> 3:35:52.200]  food and sources animals and plants and quote
[3:35:52.200 --> 3:35:56.040]  so with all of these things that we know what's going to happen
[3:35:56.040 --> 3:36:01.320]  if you're a injured ill wounded veteran or you've got cross contaminated from
[3:36:01.320 --> 3:36:05.160]  the stuff being brought back to the united states or europe wherever you are
[3:36:05.160 --> 3:36:09.480]  you cross contaminated your family the u.s. department of veteran affairs in
[3:36:09.480 --> 3:36:12.840]  vision 11 this is the region here that takes to the
[3:36:12.840 --> 3:36:17.320]  central olympia indiana michigan ohio the director barbra
[3:36:17.320 --> 3:36:22.200]  hyde to totally totally acknowledges that quote these and i'm going to quote
[3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:25.800]  this exactly read it exactly some of the physical symptoms which occur as
[3:36:25.800 --> 3:36:31.400]  result of exposure depleted uranium are sleep problems mood swings
[3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:36.040]  symptoms and upper and lower rep respiratory system neuropsychological
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:40.120]  symptoms including memory loss chronic fatigue immune dysfunction
[3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:43.320]  syndrome skin rash is unusual hair loss
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:47.640]  aching joints headaches abdominal pain sensitivity to life
[3:36:47.640 --> 3:36:51.560]  lured vision menstrual disorders gastrointestinal symptoms
[3:36:51.560 --> 3:36:55.720]  reoccurrent diarrhea and constipation nervous systems disorders such as
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:59.480]  numbness and a limb multiple chemical sensitivity and birth
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:02.040]  effects of children with parents were exposed
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:08.440]  end quote it's that i mean within their own documents they
[3:37:08.440 --> 3:37:12.280]  thoroughly totally acknowledge it okay and dr rocky what about all the
[3:37:12.280 --> 3:37:16.840]  mainstream reports i've seen of radiation detectors worldwide
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:20.920]  especially during a new war picking it up in the atmosphere
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:25.800]  that is absolutely correct dr christ busby professor christ busby in elie
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:29.720]  who is probably one of the world's leading if not the world's leading
[3:37:29.720 --> 3:37:33.560]  experts on low-level radioactivity thoroughly confirmed that the
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:37.960]  contamination from the middle east reached northern europe and
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:42.120]  england thoroughly confirmed it without any question whatsoever
[3:37:42.120 --> 3:37:47.560]  and so we're seeing all of this stuff and as a consequence from all of this okay
[3:37:47.560 --> 3:37:51.160]  we have to come back to the requirements for the department of defense
[3:37:51.160 --> 3:37:55.560]  general irish and seky when he was a commanding general signed and mandated us
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:00.520]  army regulations 700-48 that i wrote my team wrote
[3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:04.200]  he in this regulation what it requires
[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:10.040]  quote during peacetime or soon as operational risk permits the core
[3:38:10.040 --> 3:38:14.040]  joint task force division commanders radiation safety officer will
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:18.680]  identify segregate isolate secure and label all radiological contaminated
[3:38:18.680 --> 3:38:23.400]  with procedures to minimize the spread of activity will be implemented
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:27.240]  as soon as you know immediately as soon as possible
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:31.320]  we continue on this stuff the requirement is to take care of all the
[3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:35.160]  explosives all of the hands material stuff that must be done
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:39.320]  but when we come on down to the real fundamental stuff on handling all of this
[3:38:39.320 --> 3:38:43.320]  stuff okay every individual in the army has
[3:38:43.320 --> 3:38:47.080]  responsibility to do it properly in the in the personnel well
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:50.040]  well all equipment to include capture or combat
[3:38:50.040 --> 3:38:53.400]  red light can't can't play with will be surveyed packaged
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:38:56.760]  retrograde and decontaminated and released in accordance with
[3:38:56.760 --> 3:39:02.760]  detectives will both deny 1300 278 that the army pamphlet 700-48 which is
[3:39:02.760 --> 3:39:05.880]  procedures manual and other revelant guide other relevant guide but they
[3:39:05.880 --> 3:39:09.080]  don't do that they don't follow their own rules they don't follow their own rules
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:12.520]  at all and the other thing too that bothers me the most and this has happened
[3:39:12.520 --> 3:39:15.320]  over and over again because they're doing this in the united states just burning
[3:39:15.320 --> 3:39:19.480]  blowing it up and whatever quote radioactive material and waste will not
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:21.960]  be locally disposed of through burial
[3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:25.480]  submersion incineration and destruction or a place or abandonment
[3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:30.600]  and they just do it continuously without any hesitation
[3:39:30.600 --> 3:39:34.680]  so really you have the nuclear weapons and nuclear power plant industry
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:39.720]  and they're just seeding their waste everywhere that has a 40 plus million
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:43.800]  year half life people thousands of years from now
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:47.800]  will be being killed by this if we last that long as a species
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:51.800]  again dr rocky what does it say i'm going to and on a worn prison planet
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:54.600]  dot tv viewers i'm going to put some images
[3:39:54.600 --> 3:39:57.800]  we saw a doubling tripling now quadrupling of deformities in the
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:03.320]  areas where it was used in kosovo in iraq and in other areas
[3:40:03.320 --> 3:40:07.960]  what does it say about the generals and the politicians and the companies
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:11.880]  that they know their kids are breathing this they know they're breathing it
[3:40:11.880 --> 3:40:16.200]  they know it's getting into the water they know and they just don't care
[3:40:16.200 --> 3:40:19.880]  they wouldn't do this until the early 90s what changed
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:23.880]  what is the mindset of these people i'm going to be putting images of these
[3:40:23.880 --> 3:40:27.480]  to form babies up and then i want to ask you dr rocky about
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:31.000]  fighting back against this because you look at graphs of the use of du it's
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:34.040]  going up parabolically straight up as you know
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:37.960]  the good news is the iraqis are now suing the us for using this and not
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:40.360]  cleaning it up as if you could clean it up so maybe
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:43.560]  there's i mean you know talk about solutions to fight this
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:47.080]  well the other thing too is not only iraqi's are bringing this up and
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:50.360]  rightfully so but the residents of the ecus in
[3:40:50.360 --> 3:40:54.680]  port urico are also bringing this up and then i just literally got
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:40:58.440]  just right before we came on the air you know iranian munitions as you said have
[3:40:58.440 --> 3:41:02.920]  been used extensively in contaminated hawaii school field barracks on oahu
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:07.240]  and then put below a train area and the u.s army and nuclear regulatory
[3:41:07.240 --> 3:41:11.000]  commission a few weeks ago said the residents of hawaii have no standing
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:14.120]  to object or demand cleanup or medical care
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:19.800]  and uh what happened here a couple days ago cnn did a whole report on the ecus
[3:41:19.800 --> 3:41:23.000]  and how we thoroughly contaminated that area caused all the medical problems
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:26.920]  have walked away and then now what i heard just a few
[3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:30.680]  minutes ago before i went on the air is cnn has now contacted the residents of
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:33.800]  hawaii and said okay guys what's happening you need
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:37.960]  help but you have to understand the senior leadership in the department
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:41.880]  defense and u.s army and the all the marines and navy
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:45.240]  thoroughly totally disregard the health and environmental effects
[3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:49.480]  they do not provide the training they do not clean it up after it's used
[3:41:49.480 --> 3:41:53.720]  and then what happens is the men the women and the children are all affected
[3:41:53.720 --> 3:41:57.080]  they can't get the medical care that they've earned because it's denied
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:01.880]  delayed and they die or if they do get in for medical care which has happened
[3:42:01.880 --> 3:42:06.200]  personally to me and my guys right here in danville illy anivia medical center
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:09.320]  in danville illinois they just deny any correlation
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:12.680]  and if we get a doctor or somebody starts helping us
[3:42:12.680 --> 3:42:18.680]  they immediately get transferred or fired now i want to say that i i told them
[3:42:18.680 --> 3:42:24.200]  to just go online and type in uh deform babies du and i
[3:42:24.200 --> 3:42:27.800]  they went to mind flea.org which is one i hadn't even looked at i looked at major
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:31.000]  news sites and these were so horrible i told them to stop putting them up
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:33.880]  there but if people want to go look at them it's mind flea.org
[3:42:33.880 --> 3:42:39.000]  i mean it's just and they admit it's causing deformities i mean this is so
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:43.320]  hellish that i can't even look at it let's look at you know i mean you mentioned
[3:42:43.320 --> 3:42:48.120]  you said about 9-1-1 okay 9-1-1 with black operations but what is really
[3:42:48.120 --> 3:42:52.120]  horrific to me personally is the individuals that i trained from the
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:56.520]  new york police fire years you know before 9-1-1 to go on to emergency
[3:42:56.520 --> 3:42:59.320]  rescue on has materials nuclear biological
[3:42:59.320 --> 3:43:01.800]  chemical warfare explosive you have to understand the army
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:06.040]  tasked me to train them new york emergency service you get a person out
[3:43:06.040 --> 3:43:09.880]  those guys that went in there then got out and they became members of the new
[3:43:09.880 --> 3:43:14.280]  york army national guard 442nd military police unit
[3:43:14.280 --> 3:43:18.680]  they were then sent over to iraq they got exposed they started getting sick
[3:43:18.680 --> 3:43:21.720]  the children they were conceived were born with birth defects
[3:43:21.720 --> 3:43:26.120]  when those heroes of new york police and fire asked for medical care
[3:43:26.120 --> 3:43:29.960]  the army denied it when they tried to sue it they came up and said you can't
[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:33.960]  sue if you have no standing because of paris doctrine in other words
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:39.000]  you guys are out of luck in other words you're just gonna have to walk away
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:42.360]  ignore your medical care that we already require but we don't provide you and
[3:43:42.360 --> 3:43:47.560]  just uh so sorry about your children we really don't care
[3:43:47.560 --> 3:43:50.920]  well i can't even look at this i mean i was talking about mainstream news
[3:43:50.920 --> 3:43:54.760]  articles showing that the form children they went and found a new site
[3:43:54.760 --> 3:43:57.960]  mindfully that i'm aware of and i i couldn't even look at it i mean
[3:43:57.960 --> 3:44:01.400]  and then i i mean i remember back after the first gulf war
[3:44:01.400 --> 3:44:06.280]  the cover of life books a life magazine was admitting the du was causing
[3:44:06.280 --> 3:44:09.880]  deformities and it showed the deformed us kids i mean
[3:44:09.880 --> 3:44:13.400]  it's all been there for years and you have to understand every
[3:44:13.400 --> 3:44:16.520]  internal briefing we have every report that we've ever had
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:20.360]  thoroughly which is that when uh general when general swarthcough was
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:24.760]  ordered after repeat the pentagon leadership ordered general swarthcough
[3:44:24.760 --> 3:44:28.680]  to find me and tell me to clean up depleted uranium during desert storm
[3:44:28.680 --> 3:44:32.200]  so his chief of staff wrote the order and you know off i want again you know but
[3:44:32.200 --> 3:44:36.360]  hey being a career military and you know lover of america and everything okay
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:40.280]  we'll go do it and today you know all of us are affected but you know i kind of
[3:44:40.280 --> 3:44:44.680]  come back and say if i didn't do the work nobody else would
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:48.360]  what made the change is as i finished the work as the deplete director of the
[3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:51.800]  us army depleted uranium project would ended up being not only
[3:44:51.800 --> 3:44:55.800]  for the us army ended up being for the army navy coast guard marines
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:44:59.320]  but i also had a german officer a canadian officer
[3:44:59.320 --> 3:45:05.960]  an australian officer assigned to me okay so we're working all together to get
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:09.960]  it all done and we're acknowledging everything finding all the problems
[3:45:09.960 --> 3:45:13.880]  and i had the total realization after we did the research in the debata test site
[3:45:13.880 --> 3:45:18.360]  mercury debata you can't clean it up there is no medical care there is no way to
[3:45:18.360 --> 3:45:22.360]  protect everybody and i came out and told they can't ever use it again
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:25.800]  well you know you know how fast you become persona non-grad when you tell
[3:45:25.800 --> 3:45:29.400]  somebody you can't use their favorite weapon
[3:45:30.280 --> 3:45:33.560]  how do we stop the use of this how do we fight back
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:37.000]  well it's very simply there's a war against it's a crime against god and a
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:41.080]  crime against humanity and we need to have those individuals accountable for
[3:45:41.080 --> 3:45:43.960]  whether what do they do everybody is supposed to be trained everybody knows
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:46.600]  what the hazards are the senior leadership totally
[3:45:46.600 --> 3:45:50.920]  disregards it we need to restore order we need to restore
[3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:53.640]  confidence in our nation we need to restore the
[3:45:53.640 --> 3:45:57.000]  go back to the constitution and what's right under god
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:46:00.200]  not what somebody needs to do to kill destroy the main
[3:46:00.200 --> 3:46:04.040]  in order to seize terrain resources or control people
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:07.960]  you know we have to go back to the fundamentals what is right
[3:46:07.960 --> 3:46:12.360]  what should we do i mean when we destroy a nation's infrastructure to release all
[3:46:12.360 --> 3:46:16.600]  these toxic chemical compounds or we take all our trash as we're
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:19.640]  doing a rack and we burn it open pits resulted in
[3:46:19.640 --> 3:46:24.760]  credible thousands of thousands of us casualties who are who are denied care
[3:46:24.760 --> 3:46:28.520]  this is called the toxic burn pit problem you can read about it on army
[3:46:28.520 --> 3:46:32.840]  times dot com website or all over you know we need to hold these people accountable
[3:46:32.840 --> 3:46:37.560]  and tell them enough is enough i mean if we have a viable threat and an enemy
[3:46:37.560 --> 3:46:40.520]  that's going to attack it you have to be understand as a military guy i'm going
[3:46:40.520 --> 3:46:43.720]  to be the first in the line to shoot the guy okay
[3:46:43.720 --> 3:46:47.480]  the real enemy but we cannot continue to contaminate
[3:46:47.480 --> 3:46:52.200]  air water soil of food disregard the environment contamination
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:57.240]  thoroughly disregard the fact that we already ordered medical care for this
[3:46:57.240 --> 3:47:00.760]  and acknowledge it but to the sick soldier of their family member or the
[3:47:00.760 --> 3:47:06.120]  civilian we tell them there's no problem we can do what we want to do
[3:47:06.120 --> 3:47:11.720]  well it's our own troops if even if people love killing Iraqi children or
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:15.960]  Serb children and think it's cute i mean this is our own troops we're doing this
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:21.000]  to it wasn't acceptable until 1991 why why did it
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:26.360]  suddenly in the last 19 years become acceptable to engage in wars
[3:47:26.360 --> 3:47:31.000]  against humanity cry crimes against humanity of mass murder i mean there's
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:34.840]  no doubt they know what they're doing yeah and i don't have the answers to that
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:38.280]  because you know when i started yelling and screaming about it they got very
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:41.640]  nasty you know one thing we do know from the u.s department of veterinary
[3:47:41.640 --> 3:47:45.640]  affairs report you've seen these what they do is statistical analysis of the
[3:47:45.640 --> 3:47:49.640]  various casualties in the age groups and what's happening in the war
[3:47:49.640 --> 3:47:54.120]  with a operation iraqi freedom this matches desert storm this matches 100
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:47:56.200]  percent the the new york police and fire that went
[3:47:56.200 --> 3:47:59.640]  into the world trade center matches completely to the police and fire that
[3:47:59.640 --> 3:48:03.080]  went into the pentagon on that day we're looking at a 12 percent
[3:48:03.080 --> 3:48:05.800]  infectious and parasitic diseases we've got
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:11.320]  one percent absolute cancer we got four percent benign cancer
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:14.840]  endric and nutritional metabolic problems at 23 percent
[3:48:14.840 --> 3:48:18.680]  when we look at leukemias we're looking at three percent leukemias among young
[3:48:18.680 --> 3:48:22.040]  kids which they never should have them all of the yeah i've talked to a lot of
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:25.400]  medical doctors dr rocky and they say that 30 years ago
[3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:29.560]  finding a kid with cancer in a ward was like finding a leprechaun or i mean it
[3:48:29.560 --> 3:48:33.720]  was incredibly rare and that now it's just cancer everywhere and i mean it's
[3:48:33.720 --> 3:48:37.320]  like oh yeah kids just get cancer like they get the flu now
[3:48:37.320 --> 3:48:41.560]  yeah and then the ptsd said you know at 50 percent we look at the neurological
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:46.680]  problems we're looking at 37 percent and that's actually gone up and it's
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:50.680]  thoroughly reported i mean in the most recent report that came out on army
[3:48:50.680 --> 3:48:53.320]  times and again about the casualties they're thoroughly
[3:48:53.320 --> 3:48:56.760]  acknowledging that the most evacuations out of iraq and afghanistan
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:01.240]  have nothing to do with bullets of bombs they're all these toxic exposures
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:05.560]  resulting in incredible neurological respiratory and cardiac problems well
[3:49:05.560 --> 3:49:10.280]  dr rocky did you see the mayak and homeland security reports last year
[3:49:10.280 --> 3:49:14.040]  where they admit homeland security is really set up for returning veterans
[3:49:14.040 --> 3:49:18.280]  gun owners libertarians conservatives and i know the globalists are a bunch of
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:22.440]  bloodthirsty eugenicists i know they hate the troops because they're a
[3:49:22.440 --> 3:49:26.520]  bunch of globalists and i believe they actually like this they don't just not
[3:49:26.520 --> 3:49:30.120]  care and and and know about it they like it
[3:49:30.120 --> 3:49:34.200]  they like that this is happening to the troops because it's a soft kill weapon
[3:49:34.200 --> 3:49:38.040]  they're done with them they've served them they want to get rid of them we know
[3:49:38.040 --> 3:49:41.240]  they won't give them treatment i mean that that is the most
[3:49:41.240 --> 3:49:45.240]  phrasing and again as you said all the plague waivers it bothers me the most
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:47.800]  you know your people the people in the veterans are foreign whereas the
[3:49:47.800 --> 3:49:52.360]  american legion disabled american veterans when you specifically asked them
[3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:55.480]  the community will you help us get medical care will you take us to an
[3:49:55.480 --> 3:49:59.720]  appointment how about acknowledging what has really happened here
[3:49:59.720 --> 3:50:04.040]  with these incredible casualties not from bullets and bombs or cockpit
[3:50:04.040 --> 3:50:08.440]  closures man they run the other way they run so fast in the other direction
[3:50:08.440 --> 3:50:12.680]  yeah they're cowards i mean i mean if george bush or obama doesn't tell them
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:15.960]  to do it at a baseball game they're not going to do it
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:19.400]  well most people prefer to just sit there and have a six-pack of beer and watch a
[3:50:19.400 --> 3:50:22.600]  football game rather than do something that's meaningful
[3:50:22.600 --> 3:50:26.520]  to help somebody to clean even as their son comes back and his wife has two
[3:50:26.520 --> 3:50:30.200]  deformed kids and then the one that lives gets leukemia and they wonder
[3:50:30.200 --> 3:50:34.120]  why they're their grandkids dying yeah and you know we've seen this forever i
[3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:37.240]  mean you know one of my best friends that i served with in vietnam his son
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:41.080]  died as a result of the consequence of his father's you know
[3:50:41.080 --> 3:50:45.720]  age and order exposure and then you know we're same thing with my uncle
[3:50:45.720 --> 3:50:49.800]  same thing age and orange their son died i guess it was at three holes in his
[3:50:49.800 --> 3:50:54.120]  heart everything else this is the gift the government gives you
[3:50:54.120 --> 3:50:58.360]  and he was a helicopter pilot in vietnam and they knew and just didn't care it
[3:50:58.360 --> 3:51:02.680]  it's fun for them that they're hurting people's children
[3:51:02.680 --> 3:51:07.400]  for safety you lock doors set alarms buy antivirus software maybe even have a

[3:51:42.520 --> 3:51:45.880]  jeffison correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a
[3:51:45.880 --> 3:51:48.520]  greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army

[3:52:22.360 --> 3:52:27.640]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention

[3:52:30.840 --> 3:52:35.240]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty

[3:55:02.600 --> 3:55:05.960]  job to the crew and the four minutes we've got left under dug rocky give us
[3:55:05.960 --> 3:55:09.240]  some of the websites that have your research the documents posted the best
[3:55:09.240 --> 3:55:13.640]  place for people to visit who want to expose what's happening with du i mean
[3:55:13.640 --> 3:55:16.680]  hell they may start putting in the drinking water like fluoride and saying
[3:55:16.680 --> 3:55:20.680]  it's good for us if we don't well probably the best website is
[3:55:20.680 --> 3:55:27.480]  grassroots piece dot org g r a s s r o o t s
[3:55:27.480 --> 3:55:32.840]  piece p e a c e dot org that's sonny miller and charlie jane people used to
[3:55:32.840 --> 3:55:37.320]  be a trap rock until they got canned and that website is maintained the other
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:41.800]  one is with a power hour and that goes to the beyond treason
[3:55:41.800 --> 3:55:45.400]  website and the whole documentary and video you know we've done a lot of
[3:55:45.400 --> 3:55:49.400]  documentaries and videos for it all over the thing you know see we've done cbf
[3:55:49.400 --> 3:55:53.640]  60 minutes several times the bbc cnn nightline
[3:55:53.640 --> 3:55:56.760]  date line you know but what happens there's no
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:56:00.520]  long-term changes everybody kind of looks at it and then they ignore it
[3:56:00.520 --> 3:56:03.720]  because they don't want to deal with a hardcore reality
[3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:07.000]  that the united states department of defense in their effort to a war has
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:10.440]  thoroughly contaminated air water and soil and food
[3:56:10.440 --> 3:56:14.920]  resulted in incredible health and now if they admit what they did was wrong
[3:56:14.920 --> 3:56:18.600]  they'll have to give people treatment so they'll just expand it and there is not
[3:56:18.600 --> 3:56:21.720]  enough money i mean we don't have enough money so they continue on their merry
[3:56:21.720 --> 3:56:26.760]  way and totally disregarded so the only thing we can do is to
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:30.600]  get the truth out force medical care individually by thing with the actual
[3:56:30.600 --> 3:56:34.120]  report and talk to our leader see your leadership in
[3:56:34.120 --> 3:56:37.240]  congress in the house in the senate talk to the president
[3:56:37.240 --> 3:56:41.000]  and make these jerks change their attitude and do what is right
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:45.240]  but you know the probability of that is very low because it's all about making a
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:47.480]  buck
[3:56:47.480 --> 3:56:51.400]  i have a final question from the twitter it says do you
[3:56:51.400 --> 3:56:55.480]  think du is being used because it's effective at penetration or because it
[3:56:55.480 --> 3:56:59.880]  keeps on killing or both everything all of the above
[3:56:59.880 --> 3:57:02.920]  you have to understand it's extraordinarily effective against all
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:06.440]  targets and we know there's no armor targets left in iraq and afghanistan
[3:57:06.440 --> 3:57:10.120]  to mager yaman or the boffins they're shooting up
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:14.280]  houses and buildings and civilian cars and trucks that they could use a
[3:57:14.280 --> 3:57:18.760]  slingshot again georgia they used it in georgia oh incredible they used it out
[3:57:18.760 --> 3:57:21.960]  in every all over the united states has had a problem
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:24.840]  i mean you know a glen air force base in florida
[3:57:24.840 --> 3:57:28.520]  you know we go down to texas all over down texas we go out to
[3:57:28.520 --> 3:57:32.120]  utah we go out to nevada i mean i personally shot nevada
[3:57:32.120 --> 3:57:35.000]  above i mean all over the place i personally did
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:38.360]  uh it's just a total disregard and then you have all the manufacturing sites
[3:57:38.360 --> 3:57:40.840]  whether it's all but in new york with natural led
[3:57:40.840 --> 3:57:43.640]  that you know it's been closed but it's a total environmental disaster
[3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:49.400]  starved at concord massachusetts you got arojet down at uh john found tenacy
[3:57:49.400 --> 3:57:53.480]  you've got a lion up there in the twin cities mini apple st paul they don't
[3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:56.920]  care they don't care
[3:57:57.640 --> 3:58:03.080]  unbelievable but in austin they'll come arrest somebody if they cut down a
[3:58:03.080 --> 3:58:06.600]  cedar tree on their own property and they'll arrest you if you actually
[3:58:06.600 --> 3:58:10.200]  throw a battery away in the trash again they use this to control us but
[3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:12.600]  anything really that's a serious threat like genetic
[3:58:12.600 --> 3:58:18.440]  engineering gmo depleted uranium hiv and the factor
[3:58:18.440 --> 3:58:22.200]  eight shots mercury in the vaccines uh melamine in the
[3:58:22.200 --> 3:58:25.880]  mill they say hey have your kids drink it melamine's no longer bad mercury in
