[00:00.000 --> 00:28.240]  Seven hundred years before medieval Europe ever captured or shipped one black soul, one
[00:28.240 --> 00:39.440]  African out of Africa. The Arabs had created the trade, they ran the trade, and they control
[00:39.440 --> 00:44.380]  the trade to this day, where it's seen as a status symbol that African slaves in your
[00:44.380 --> 00:52.480]  haram, which is the godlike heaven zone that a lord lives in, haram, that the hidden, the
[00:52.480 --> 01:02.280]  secret to heaven, and all over the world, the ultra-rich Islamists have black servants.
[01:02.280 --> 01:07.000]  They sell Africans over there, in Libya, they sell men, even 15-year-old Libyans are there
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.240]  in a car, they're armed, they'll come and kidnap you, and they'll sell you for 70 to
[01:11.240 --> 01:18.120]  $150, and then others will resell you. As soon as you arrive in Libya, the first thing
[01:18.120 --> 01:24.960]  that happens is that you are taken away and sold. Like an animal, I was sold four times
[01:24.960 --> 01:30.320]  in open markets in Libya. The last time I was sold for $10,000, I was tortured every
[01:30.320 --> 01:39.000]  day. The worldwide hub for the slave trade all over the Pacific Ocean, starting 700
[01:39.000 --> 01:48.680]  years before any blacks were sold by whites, was Somalia, and the light skinned Arabs
[01:48.680 --> 01:57.400]  there did not allow their people to marry anyone from Kenya or the surrounding areas.
[01:57.400 --> 02:23.400]  They got slaves from as far away as Nigeria.
[02:23.400 --> 02:36.640]  What we're finding is that Libya is now a broken economy without any rule. It's got
[02:36.640 --> 02:42.000]  a very small population, 6 million people, and the size of Libya is twice the size of
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.280]  France. So it's a small population, and they seem to be essentially living off the migrant
[02:47.280 --> 02:52.600]  trade, migrants being passed from one to another, being exploited as laborers who don't get
[02:52.600 --> 02:57.880]  paid, or simply being abused in different ways than being sold on for profit. So it's
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.280]  kind of a shocking situation, and it's very difficult to know what can be done about it
[03:02.280 --> 03:06.760]  because the country is in such chaos, and as we know, ISIS are there, there are different
[03:06.760 --> 03:09.960]  militias, there's no central government of any name.
[03:09.960 --> 03:17.560]  Now this is currently going on. Ilhan Omar is an Arab, and it talks about she as a god.
[03:17.560 --> 03:24.080]  You look up her name, it's one of the dominant families in Somalia that is known as royalty
[03:24.080 --> 03:32.360]  basically, and known as rulers of humans, or rulers of slaves. Piracy, kidnapping, black
[03:32.360 --> 03:41.880]  slavery, white slavery. She's a god, and she comes to rule you, and you will bow. You will
[03:41.880 --> 04:09.040]  hit that damn knee.
[04:09.040 --> 04:21.800]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all
[04:21.800 --> 04:26.920]  citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior. A higher rating means you
[04:26.920 --> 04:32.960]  get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport security, but a low-sports
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.120]  means you can rent a car or apply for visas. The Chinese government expects to make this
[04:38.120 --> 04:43.360]  system mandatory in 2020. Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search
[04:43.360 --> 04:49.200]  engine in China. The Chinese government, as people probably know, has a quite comprehensive
[04:49.200 --> 05:09.740]  boundary here.
[05:09.740 --> 05:11.540]  solicit activities over two decades.
[05:11.540 --> 05:14.940]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[05:14.940 --> 05:18.220]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[05:18.220 --> 05:22.500]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[05:22.500 --> 05:25.540]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change, and they will become the
[05:25.540 --> 05:29.620]  big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran American
[05:29.620 --> 05:33.860]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[05:33.860 --> 05:34.860]  the Great Depression.
[05:34.860 --> 05:39.700]  The court's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world, to
[05:39.700 --> 05:44.020]  make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise
[05:44.020 --> 05:45.500]  of an independent free press.
[05:45.500 --> 05:49.260]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to
[05:49.260 --> 05:53.060]  try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts, and then the whopper of
[05:53.060 --> 05:56.820]  telling us the whole time it's not happening, it's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[05:56.820 --> 06:25.020]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw.
[06:26.820 --> 06:43.780]  As I told you two and a half years ago, the White House was chopped full, absolutely crammed
[06:43.780 --> 06:50.180]  to the gills with deep state operatives both from the neocon and the leftist loveless wings.
[06:50.180 --> 06:56.340]  They were spying on President Trump the entire time and leaking twisted information.
[06:56.340 --> 07:00.460]  They would take anything and everything Trump did and then leak the classified info but
[07:00.460 --> 07:05.500]  mix lies into it as well trying to derail the country.
[07:05.500 --> 07:10.300]  They engaged in shadow diplomacy where they would know what the President's moves were
[07:10.300 --> 07:15.220]  going to be that would be given to Barack Obama, to John Kerry, to Hillary Clinton,
[07:15.220 --> 07:16.220]  and others.
[07:16.220 --> 07:20.460]  Well, several of those spies have been discovered.
[07:20.460 --> 07:27.100]  A lot more of those spies are going to be discovered and these documents are being released
[07:27.100 --> 07:30.460]  to Congress.
[07:30.460 --> 07:37.060]  This should be the top story in the nation, but of course, if you're not on infowars.com
[07:37.060 --> 07:42.460]  or drudgereport.com or thegatewaypundit.com, you're not going to hear anything about it.
[07:42.460 --> 07:50.340]  But the headline on infowars.com is deep state spies caught stealing national security information
[07:50.340 --> 07:51.340]  from the White House.
[07:51.340 --> 07:53.340]  It's all completely illegal.
[07:53.340 --> 07:59.540]  It's like Sandy Berger snuck into the bubble in the capital and went in and got classified
[07:59.540 --> 08:06.180]  information that exposed Bill Clinton and put it in his socks and got caught because
[08:06.180 --> 08:07.380]  he wanted it out of there.
[08:07.380 --> 08:09.380]  There was only one copy.
[08:09.380 --> 08:11.300]  He was afraid someone would read it.
[08:11.300 --> 08:17.100]  Well, he barely even served any time for that, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:17.100 --> 08:21.940]  So that's the type of things they're up to and it's cut and dry illegal.
[08:21.940 --> 08:28.460]  And the word is three different federal grand juries are hearing the evidence for indictment
[08:28.460 --> 08:32.980]  and the word is the indictments are going to be handed down.
[08:32.980 --> 08:38.100]  James Comey, of course, gave the order illegally and nothing criminal was found.
[08:38.100 --> 08:42.380]  But the act of stealing the classified data and the act of putting a spy in the White
[08:42.380 --> 08:47.180]  House totally violates the separation of powers that shows a rogue agency.
[08:47.180 --> 08:51.580]  I'm going to be covering this at the bottom of the hour in detail with the documents,
[08:51.580 --> 08:52.580]  the names, the facts.
[08:52.580 --> 08:54.580]  We've got them all right here.
[08:54.580 --> 09:00.340]  We're going to go over those and I'm also waiting on a phone call that I'm going to
[09:00.340 --> 09:04.140]  be taking during the next break with more information on this because I was told about
[09:04.140 --> 09:08.620]  this not just two and a half years ago, but obviously we would have been breaking that
[09:08.620 --> 09:13.820]  down and we have some good sources that are meant to tell us exactly who the other indictments
[09:13.820 --> 09:16.540]  are going to be of reportedly.
[09:16.540 --> 09:22.700]  So this is a big, big, big deal and we'll be looking at all of it coming up at the bottom
[09:22.700 --> 09:27.140]  of the hour in about 20 minutes from now.
[09:27.140 --> 09:31.700]  Here's what else we've got for you today, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:31.700 --> 09:41.180]  AOC, U.S. must have lifelong commitment to migrant children, health care services for
[09:41.180 --> 09:42.180]  life.
[09:42.180 --> 09:44.580]  That's right.
[09:44.580 --> 09:46.140]  You heard that right.
[09:46.140 --> 09:48.260]  She says they're victims of concentration camps.
[09:48.260 --> 09:49.980]  They're made to drink out of toilets.
[09:49.980 --> 09:55.580]  They've been so abused that they need free services and psychological services for life.
[09:55.580 --> 09:57.980]  She told the London Guardian.
[09:57.980 --> 10:04.700]  Now you've seen hundreds of lawsuits filed, all asking for $3 million if children were
[10:04.700 --> 10:08.300]  separated for even an hour from their parents while it was verified who they were with,
[10:08.300 --> 10:16.380]  or if the living conditions weren't the Ritz Carlton, supposedly, $3 million a piece of
[10:16.380 --> 10:17.380]  taxpayer money.
[10:17.380 --> 10:21.020]  You see, when you come here to get free stuff and you bring your kids across dangerous deserts
[10:21.020 --> 10:26.860]  and pay smugglers to do it, and a lot of them aren't their parents, they use them to mule
[10:26.860 --> 10:32.820]  drugs across, how do you turn that around when you're a criminal group engaging in crime
[10:32.820 --> 10:36.500]  and sucking off people and endangering your children?
[10:36.500 --> 10:37.500]  Many times not even your children.
[10:37.500 --> 10:42.020]  Well, you turn it around and say, concentration camps, and we deserve more free stuff for
[10:42.020 --> 10:43.260]  the rest of our lives.
[10:43.260 --> 10:46.900]  Well, Tlaib will play a clip in a moment.
[10:46.900 --> 10:52.700]  The Islamic Congresswoman from Detroit, the burnout rubble of that once, great city, she's
[10:52.700 --> 11:00.820]  saying that everyone deserves $20 an hour, even though Bernie Panduth had to lay off
[11:00.820 --> 11:06.580]  a lot of his employees or a lot of his campaign people or cut them from 60 hours to 43 hours
[11:06.580 --> 11:13.460]  because they demanded to go from $13 an hour to $15 an hour, but Sanders was paying them
[11:13.460 --> 11:14.460]  time and a half.
[11:14.460 --> 11:20.500]  And so they had to get the extra 20 hours cut because time and a half for 13 is obviously
[11:20.500 --> 11:25.300]  a lot of money, but time and a half for 15 is even more.
[11:25.300 --> 11:29.620]  So he's learning about economics, he's never run a business, he's swindled colleges and
[11:29.620 --> 11:37.580]  has $3 million plus homes and drives $18,000 cars, actually looked it up, $118,000 car,
[11:37.580 --> 11:39.940]  I've never had a $100,000 car.
[11:39.940 --> 11:45.140]  I mean, this is just all going on here, but he's going to tell you that you've got to
[11:45.140 --> 11:47.940]  hire people for $15 an hour.
[11:47.940 --> 11:55.300]  Now in New York, you pretty much need that, not in South Texas.
[11:55.300 --> 12:03.980]  The owner of the little hot dog shack doesn't make $15 an hour, so it's just insane.
[12:03.980 --> 12:09.700]  So here's Tlaib offering more free stuff, free housing, free transportation, free education,
[12:09.700 --> 12:14.420]  free healthcare, free, free, free, and now $20, here it is.
[12:14.420 --> 12:24.900]  But $2.13, as a tip to place, $2.13 per hour, federally, some states, of course, here in
[12:24.900 --> 12:32.100]  Michigan, for $3.50 or so, but think about that for one minute, and people cannot live
[12:32.100 --> 12:38.740]  on those kinds of wages, and we can't allow people to be living off of tips and ways, so
[12:38.740 --> 12:45.740]  it's just not enough to remind us tips, wages, it's just not, or whatever they call it,
[12:45.740 --> 12:48.740]  it's income, because it's just not enough to support our family.
[12:48.740 --> 12:49.740]  But I also want to always tell a story because...
[12:49.740 --> 12:50.740]  Okay, I can't listen anymore to this.
[12:50.740 --> 12:56.020]  You heard her say $20, which again, when you add in all the taxes and the regulations
[12:56.020 --> 13:02.460]  and the social security, somebody being paid $20 an hour is being paid like $26, $27 an
[13:02.460 --> 13:03.460]  hour.
[13:03.460 --> 13:06.740]  Nobody can pay that in your average retail shop or wherever.
[13:06.740 --> 13:10.380]  A lot of times, little retail shops aren't selling about a couple hundred dollars of
[13:10.380 --> 13:12.060]  things an hour.
[13:12.060 --> 13:18.540]  How do you pay for the lights, the regulations, the insurance, the rent, or the property taxes
[13:18.540 --> 13:19.540]  and the employees?
[13:19.540 --> 13:22.040]  It's insane.
[13:22.040 --> 13:25.260]  The New York Times says we need a $33 an hour.
[13:25.260 --> 13:28.540]  Do you know what an inflation will do if they did that too?
[13:28.540 --> 13:30.940]  Again, this would sink the economy.
[13:30.940 --> 13:33.340]  You know what the average wage in China is, right?
[13:33.340 --> 13:35.100]  It's $2 an hour.
[13:35.100 --> 13:42.500]  How are we going to compete with Mexico that's got less than $2 an hour being the average
[13:42.500 --> 13:43.500]  wage?
[13:43.500 --> 13:45.820]  Well, the answer is you're not going to do it.
[13:45.820 --> 13:49.020]  And the country is going to go belly up, which is the Democrats plan.
[13:49.020 --> 13:54.780]  Cloward and Piven is to wreck the economy to be able to completely and totally absolutely
[13:54.780 --> 13:55.780]  take it over.
[13:55.780 --> 13:59.380]  We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and get more into this.
[13:59.380 --> 14:03.500]  But the idea that you get here and you're entitled to free stuff for life because you're
[14:03.500 --> 14:08.220]  a victim, it's like slave reparations.
[14:08.220 --> 14:14.980]  But then meanwhile, Ilhan Omar comes from the upper caste elite tribe of Somalis that
[14:14.980 --> 14:21.060]  specialty is slavery to this day, but only of subhuman blacks.
[14:21.060 --> 14:22.540]  They have a name for it.
[14:22.540 --> 14:27.220]  We just played in the first segment if you missed it, documentaries with black Africans
[14:27.220 --> 14:32.100]  from Kenya who, by the way, on average have higher accused than Somalis and looked it
[14:32.100 --> 14:33.660]  up and they're stronger and everything else.
[14:33.660 --> 14:37.540]  But of course, they're saying they're subhuman when if you look at all the African tribes
[14:37.540 --> 14:42.780]  that the Kenyans are pretty noble folks, definitely compared to the Somalis.
[14:42.780 --> 14:49.940]  So it's just amazing inversion of reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:49.940 --> 14:54.180]  Absolute inversion of reality.
[14:54.180 --> 14:57.820]  So that's all coming up today and so much more.
[14:57.820 --> 15:02.300]  Please do not forget, we got DNA Force Plus back in stock.

[16:04.580 --> 16:08.820]  backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[16:08.820 --> 16:10.620]  important message you'll ever hear.
[16:10.620 --> 16:14.500]  Bill Hyde here, I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:14.500 --> 16:19.100]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:19.100 --> 16:20.100]  off the grid.
[16:20.100 --> 16:24.020]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[16:24.020 --> 16:25.500]  bank of the Mississippi.
[16:25.500 --> 16:29.340]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:29.340 --> 16:33.100]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:33.100 --> 16:37.460]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:37.460 --> 16:43.100]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[16:43.100 --> 16:48.460]  That's myownpowergrid.com, over a thousand dollars in great off the grid gear and a ton
[16:48.460 --> 16:49.460]  of bonuses too.

[16:53.700 --> 16:59.380]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more, that's myownpowergrid.com.
[16:59.380 --> 17:04.380]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[17:04.380 --> 17:08.020]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[17:08.020 --> 17:13.060]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[17:13.060 --> 17:16.580]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:16.580 --> 17:21.100]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[17:21.100 --> 17:22.100]  across America.
[17:22.100 --> 17:25.980]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.

[17:30.020 --> 17:31.020]  I feel.

[17:33.300 --> 17:38.460]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[17:38.460 --> 17:40.940]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[17:57.820 --> 18:01.660]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:01.660 --> 18:02.660]  Marcus here on the air.
[18:02.660 --> 18:03.660]  Thanks for holding.
[18:03.660 --> 18:06.340]  Hey, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.340 --> 18:10.260]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:10.260 --> 18:12.460]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.460 --> 18:16.860]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.860 --> 18:21.260]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching
[18:21.260 --> 18:22.260]  2020.
[18:22.260 --> 18:23.260]  That's it.
[18:23.260 --> 18:25.260]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.260 --> 18:28.060]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.060 --> 18:29.340]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.340 --> 18:30.340]  I agree entirely.
[18:30.340 --> 18:33.500]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[18:33.500 --> 18:35.460]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.460 --> 18:38.420]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.420 --> 18:40.700]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.700 --> 18:43.900]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.900 --> 18:48.500]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.500 --> 18:49.500]  who are going to continue.
[18:49.500 --> 18:51.740]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[18:51.740 --> 18:55.780]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[18:55.780 --> 18:58.260]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.260 --> 19:02.380]  Thank you, sir, for calling.

[19:58.100 --> 20:25.700]  supplement routine.
[20:58.100 --> 21:01.100]  Hi, could I get a moment of your time here?
[21:01.100 --> 21:07.300]  Could you tell me, do you agree with AOC that ICE is running concentration camps on the
[21:07.300 --> 21:08.300]  board?
[21:08.300 --> 21:09.300]  I'm watching the mid-tards.
[21:09.300 --> 21:12.340]  There are camps, and people are being concentrated.
[21:12.340 --> 21:13.340]  This is very simple.
[21:13.340 --> 21:17.180]  I don't even know why this is a controversial thing for her to say.
[21:17.180 --> 21:22.820]  We have to really truthfully speak about what's taking place, and this is why it's really
[21:22.820 --> 21:27.460]  important for us to abolish ICE and make sure that we have an agency that is accountable
[21:27.460 --> 21:34.020]  to the people, that is dealing with the situation in a humane way.
[21:34.020 --> 21:41.660]  There's no way that we can allow for kids to be caged in this country, and children to
[21:41.660 --> 21:48.140]  be separated from their families, and people being terrorized in their communities.
[21:48.140 --> 21:49.140]  Is it fair to communicate?
[21:49.140 --> 22:09.460]  We have to make sure that we are calling it out, and I am 100% with Alex.
[22:09.460 --> 22:15.340]  I'm watching the mid-tards, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[22:15.340 --> 22:23.060]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[22:23.060 --> 22:25.060]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[22:25.060 --> 22:26.060]  You want to drop?
[22:26.060 --> 22:27.060]  You want to drop?
[22:27.060 --> 22:28.060]  Damn!
[22:28.060 --> 22:29.060]  Who in the president?
[22:29.060 --> 22:40.060]  You didn't support the...
[22:40.060 --> 22:50.060]  You didn't support the...
[22:50.060 --> 23:02.020]  Muslims.
[23:02.020 --> 23:12.900]  You would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker.
[23:12.900 --> 23:20.500]  The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border, and that is
[23:20.500 --> 23:22.580]  exactly what they are.
[23:22.580 --> 23:31.580]  They are concentration camps, and if that doesn't bother you, I don't...
[23:31.580 --> 23:36.860]  I don't know, I like...
[23:36.860 --> 23:37.860]  We can have...
[23:37.860 --> 23:38.860]  Okay, whatever.
[23:38.860 --> 23:44.260]  I want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that we should
[23:44.260 --> 23:45.260]  not...
[23:45.260 --> 23:54.260]  That never again means something, and that the fact that concentration camps are now
[23:54.260 --> 24:06.300]  an institutionalized practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing.
[24:06.300 --> 24:09.100]  And we need to do something about it.
[24:09.100 --> 24:15.820]  This week, children, immigrant children were moved to the same internment camps where the
[24:15.820 --> 24:22.060]  Japanese were held in the early 20th century.
[24:22.060 --> 24:27.820]  And this is not even about a crisis for...
[24:27.820 --> 24:35.020]  Is it not just about the immigrant communities being held in concentration camps being a
[24:35.020 --> 24:36.020]  crisis?
[24:36.020 --> 24:37.420]  This is a crisis for ourselves.
[24:37.420 --> 24:45.380]  This is a crisis on if America will remain America in its actual principles and values,
[24:45.380 --> 24:54.180]  or if we are losing to an authoritarian and fascist presidency.
[24:54.180 --> 24:57.580]  And so I think that that is...
[24:57.580 --> 24:59.340]  I don't use those words lightly.
[24:59.340 --> 25:05.980]  I don't use those words to just throw bombs.
[25:05.980 --> 25:12.940]  I use that word because that is what an administration that creates concentration camps is.
[25:12.940 --> 25:20.980]  A presidency that creates concentration camps is fascist.
[25:20.980 --> 25:26.420]  And it's very difficult to say that.
[25:26.420 --> 25:29.860]  This is what organizing looks like.
[25:29.860 --> 25:33.180]  This is what building power looks like.
[25:33.180 --> 25:36.380]  This is what changing the country looks like.
[25:36.380 --> 25:41.540]  It's when we choose to show up and occupy the room and talk about the things that matter
[25:41.540 --> 25:44.420]  most talking about our future.
[25:44.420 --> 25:50.420]  You know, Reverend, you bring up a funny anecdote, and I'm proud to be a bartender.
[25:50.420 --> 25:54.420]  Ain't nothing wrong with that.
[25:54.420 --> 26:00.140]  There's nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy.
[26:00.140 --> 26:04.780]  There is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors...
[26:04.780 --> 26:07.460]  Hey guys, did you hear the news?
[26:07.460 --> 26:12.260]  Guardians of the Galaxy is cancelled because the lead actor, Chris Pratt, wore a really
[26:12.260 --> 26:13.760]  insensitive shirt.
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.620]  Now I have to warn you before I show it to you that viewer discretion is advised.
[26:18.620 --> 26:20.980]  Are you ready?
[26:20.980 --> 26:31.140]  Okay, that was scary.
[26:31.140 --> 26:34.940]  So last week, Guardians of the Galaxy star, Chris Pratt, was walking around town with
[26:34.940 --> 26:40.220]  his wife, being normal human beings when a crazed paparazzi decided to take a photo of
[26:40.220 --> 26:46.420]  the two of them, and somehow, for some reason I can't comprehend, this photo of him holding
[26:46.420 --> 26:51.660]  a water bottle in one hand and his wife in the other turned into one of the biggest stories
[26:51.660 --> 26:53.620]  of the week on the internet.
[26:53.620 --> 26:54.620]  Why?
[26:54.620 --> 26:56.140]  Well, let's look closer.
[26:56.140 --> 26:58.020]  Look at that shirt.
[26:58.020 --> 26:59.020]  That's right.
[26:59.020 --> 27:03.260]  It was his shirt of all things that caused a huge controversy online and set leftists
[27:03.260 --> 27:08.700]  into a panic, a t-shirt of an American flag with the words, don't tread on me, which by
[27:08.700 --> 27:14.340]  the way, you can get right now at infowarstore.com for only $17.76.
[27:14.340 --> 27:18.660]  This t-shirt made liberals all over Twitter call him the forbidden R word.
[27:18.660 --> 27:24.020]  It even led to Yahoo News publishing a full blown hit piece on Pratt and accused him of
[27:24.020 --> 27:26.220]  wearing a white super sauce shirt.
[27:26.220 --> 27:30.500]  We have to say super sauce so the YouTube gods don't come after us.
[27:30.500 --> 27:32.140]  Just look at this headline.
[27:32.140 --> 27:35.700]  Chris Pratt criticized for white super sauce t-shirt.
[27:35.700 --> 27:40.860]  This article was so bad that they had to change the headline to Chris Pratt criticized for
[27:40.860 --> 27:41.860]  t-shirt choice.
[27:41.860 --> 27:47.180]  In fact, they even included an update at the top of the article that says this article
[27:47.180 --> 27:53.100]  was updated on 17 July with the initial headline, Chris Pratt criticized for white super sauce
[27:53.100 --> 27:57.980]  t-shirt being amended to Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[27:57.980 --> 28:03.500]  References to white super sauce in this article have been removed, but that didn't stop Yahoo
[28:03.500 --> 28:06.780]  from publishing another article that same day.
[28:06.780 --> 28:12.220]  Chris Pratt is in hot water for this controversial t-shirt and the internet has thoughts.
[28:12.220 --> 28:17.020]  This article, by the way, has plenty of references to white super sauce.
[28:17.020 --> 28:21.460]  The article reads, the coiled rattlesnake with the don't tread on me message is the
[28:21.460 --> 28:26.940]  iconography associated with the gas and flag created by Continental Army Brigadier General
[28:26.940 --> 28:28.300]  Christopher Gadsden.
[28:28.300 --> 28:33.460]  While the flag's original purpose wasn't rooted in white super sauce, it has been adopted
[28:33.460 --> 28:37.820]  by some white super sauces in the far right groups in recent years.
[28:37.820 --> 28:43.820]  In some of these instances, swaffles, yeah, we'll go with that, have been added to the
[28:43.820 --> 28:44.820]  design.
[28:44.820 --> 28:48.220]  Who adds a swaffle to a...
[28:48.220 --> 28:53.260]  So when Pratt was spotted wearing a shirt with the Gadsden design, some people quickly
[28:53.260 --> 28:59.260]  drew a parallel between Pratt's order of choice and the last possible...
[28:59.260 --> 29:03.340]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector

[29:10.340 --> 29:14.740]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[29:14.740 --> 29:17.980]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[29:17.980 --> 29:21.900]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[29:21.900 --> 29:26.100]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:26.100 --> 29:30.260]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have approved a turnkey equipment
[29:30.260 --> 29:36.580]  sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account
[29:36.580 --> 29:37.580]  each month.

[29:52.940 --> 29:55.340]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[29:55.340 --> 29:58.540]  before purchasing, not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.

[30:10.660 --> 30:14.940]  evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom
[30:14.940 --> 30:18.980]  of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw all those lies against
[30:18.980 --> 30:22.860]  us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars,
[30:22.860 --> 30:24.580]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[30:24.580 --> 30:29.100]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in
[30:29.100 --> 30:32.380]  my heart and I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you

[30:35.940 --> 30:40.820]  because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win and without you I'm going
[30:40.820 --> 30:44.420]  to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[30:44.420 --> 30:45.700]  The enemy could win.
[30:45.700 --> 30:47.820]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[30:47.820 --> 30:49.060]  We're being used by God.
[30:49.060 --> 30:50.260]  You're being used by God.
[30:50.260 --> 30:51.260]  This is providence.
[30:51.260 --> 30:55.500]  So I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.

[32:00.540 --> 32:05.900]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com
[32:05.900 --> 32:11.500]  but also the products at InfoWars.com and there's one product that's offered at InfoWars.com
[32:11.500 --> 32:15.900]  that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[32:15.900 --> 32:19.900]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[32:19.900 --> 32:23.700]  Telomere's and Telomere's support with your DNA.
[32:23.700 --> 32:28.580]  So I started to look into the science and what Telomere's were and how it can improve
[32:28.580 --> 32:32.100]  your health and longevity when you protect your Telomere's.
[32:32.100 --> 32:35.540]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[32:35.540 --> 32:36.540]  Why?
[32:36.540 --> 32:40.900]  Because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming
[32:40.900 --> 32:45.940]  up with competitive supplements for Telomere's support and they came and they went.
[32:45.940 --> 32:48.940]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[32:48.940 --> 32:50.420]  It is the elite supplement.
[32:50.420 --> 32:54.300]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[32:54.300 --> 32:59.980]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWars.com.
[33:24.300 --> 33:27.500]  I'm going to be back live next hour.
[33:27.500 --> 33:32.420]  I'm working on a big story right here and I've got to make some phone calls and this
[33:32.420 --> 33:37.860]  is some big stuff about the latest attempted coup against the president and against the
[33:37.860 --> 33:43.220]  country and then Lord Monkton's going to be joining us as well with big new developments
[33:43.220 --> 33:47.140]  exposing the fact that they know man make global warming and climate change is a fraud.
[33:47.140 --> 33:51.260]  Of course we already know that but a bunch of major studies, a bunch of big admissions,
[33:51.260 --> 33:54.780]  are going to be coming up as well today.
[33:54.780 --> 34:00.380]  But I don't normally air something over and over and over again but I've aired this
[34:00.380 --> 34:01.380]  already three times.
[34:01.380 --> 34:02.380]  I'm going to air it again.
[34:02.380 --> 34:08.220]  It's Professor Robert Epstein who's a psychologist and runs big computer science programs, works
[34:08.220 --> 34:09.580]  with DARPA you name it.
[34:09.580 --> 34:13.860]  He testified as you know last week that Google's already stealing the election along with Facebook
[34:13.860 --> 34:19.460]  and if it doesn't get stopped we will see the election stolen in 2020.
[34:19.460 --> 34:29.780]  So this is a paramount issue and then next hour I am going to start the hour off getting
[34:29.780 --> 34:36.420]  into the espionage and the spies caught inside the White House and really how deep all of
[34:36.420 --> 34:38.420]  that goes.
[34:38.420 --> 34:47.620]  So we'll be back, I'll be back live next hour with all of that information and we're going
[34:47.620 --> 34:52.060]  to be breaking it all down, it's very, very important so please stay with us.
[34:52.060 --> 35:00.180]  Google's manipulation of votes gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton
[35:00.180 --> 35:02.500]  in the year 2016, is that correct?
[35:02.500 --> 35:07.100]  2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum.
[35:07.100 --> 35:14.940]  The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they were
[35:14.940 --> 35:18.140]  in using the techniques that I've been studying.
[35:18.140 --> 35:22.700]  They control these and no one can counteract them.
[35:22.700 --> 35:31.060]  These are not competitive, these are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[35:31.060 --> 35:39.780]  Your testimony is that Google is through bias in search results manipulating voters in a
[35:39.780 --> 35:41.340]  way they're not aware of.
[35:41.340 --> 35:48.340]  On a massive scale in 2020 if all these companies are supporting the same candidate there are
[35:48.340 --> 35:54.660]  15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving
[35:54.660 --> 35:58.340]  a paper trail for authorities to trace.
[35:58.340 --> 36:02.740]  Without monitoring systems in place we'll never know what these companies are doing
[36:02.740 --> 36:12.740]  and in 2020 you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out and the methods that
[36:12.740 --> 36:20.820]  they're using are invisible, they're subliminal, they're more powerful than most any effects
[36:20.820 --> 36:24.060]  I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the behavioral sciences for
[36:24.060 --> 36:25.060]  almost 40 years.
[36:25.060 --> 36:31.540]  A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions
[36:31.540 --> 36:40.500]  of dollars if not billions of dollars collectively massively influencing the results of elections.
[36:40.500 --> 36:43.140]  Senator with respect I must correct you.
[36:43.140 --> 36:48.100]  If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go vote reminder just to Democrats on election
[36:48.100 --> 36:52.060]  day that doesn't cost him a dime.
[36:52.060 --> 36:57.820]  Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers
[36:57.820 --> 37:05.660]  too sensitive for its citizens, translation Google is helping China silence its political
[37:05.660 --> 37:06.660]  opposition.
[37:06.660 --> 37:10.820]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all
[37:10.820 --> 37:14.820]  citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[37:14.820 --> 37:20.220]  A higher rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport
[37:20.220 --> 37:25.140]  security but a low sports means you can rent a car or apply for visas.
[37:25.140 --> 37:29.420]  The Chinese government expects to make this system mandatory in 2020.
[37:29.420 --> 37:33.580]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[37:33.580 --> 37:39.820]  The Chinese government as people probably know has a quite comprehensive internet censorship
[37:39.820 --> 37:44.780]  system set up and it's known as the great firewall that blocks all kinds of information
[37:44.780 --> 37:49.820]  about political opponents of the ruling Communist Party regime.
[37:49.820 --> 37:52.460]  They're all kinds of things that they're blocking out.
[37:52.460 --> 37:57.700]  These agree to ban particular sites or search times on topics like human rights, democracy
[37:57.700 --> 37:59.260]  and free speech.
[37:59.260 --> 38:05.460]  You know Google's really the CIA but it's leftist run now so it's run over to China
[38:05.460 --> 38:08.460]  and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[38:08.460 --> 38:14.620]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches which is what Google sells to
[38:14.620 --> 38:17.100]  us as being fair and unbiased.
[38:17.100 --> 38:22.020]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering
[38:22.020 --> 38:23.700]  its search suggestions.
[38:23.700 --> 38:24.700]  We never know what happens.
[38:24.700 --> 38:29.620]  Well Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by
[38:29.620 --> 38:34.660]  changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story that's according
[38:34.660 --> 38:35.660]  to website Infowars.
[38:35.660 --> 38:40.860]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence but it's officially
[38:40.860 --> 38:45.300]  moved its main operations for AI to China and is merging with the Chinese government
[38:45.300 --> 38:46.980]  letting them have all the technology.
[38:46.980 --> 38:52.500]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government sending propaganda to its
[38:52.500 --> 38:56.460]  people to keep them under the control of the government but we shouldn't worry about the
[38:56.460 --> 38:59.420]  fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[38:59.420 --> 39:00.420]  Not a big deal.
[39:00.420 --> 39:05.460]  I mean that's a lot you just said there but I think it's all true.
[39:05.460 --> 39:10.540]  So Google always swears that its liberal anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the
[39:10.540 --> 39:15.140]  search product but here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper
[39:15.140 --> 39:17.220]  with searches as a form of political act.
[39:17.220 --> 39:22.220]  The Chinese government let's remember in prisons, dissidents and Christians daily.
[39:22.220 --> 39:28.420]  They have more than a million Muslims in reeducation camps but the legitimate election of President
[39:28.420 --> 39:34.940]  Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values give me a break.
[39:34.940 --> 39:37.020]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[39:37.020 --> 39:42.820]  If a Google user types in Clinton body they get car repair shop results instead of a story
[39:42.820 --> 39:46.860]  that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious
[39:46.860 --> 39:48.860]  circumstances over the last three decades.
[39:48.860 --> 39:54.340]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's leaked emails were likely responsible
[39:54.340 --> 39:58.460]  for the deaths of up to 20 CIA agents working in China.
[39:58.460 --> 40:03.860]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[40:03.860 --> 40:07.420]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning
[40:07.420 --> 40:11.460]  people, that are outright banning people and they're blocking conservatives involved
[40:11.460 --> 40:13.180]  in their own first amendment political speech.
[40:13.180 --> 40:17.540]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment but instead
[40:17.540 --> 40:22.420]  attack dogging calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working
[40:22.420 --> 40:23.420]  with big tech.
[40:23.420 --> 40:27.740]  You're not allowed to get the Info Wars official app on your iPhone.
[40:27.740 --> 40:32.220]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[40:32.220 --> 40:38.700]  But if you're the Chinese government and you want access to every citizen and all their
[40:38.700 --> 40:46.260]  data and everything they've ever done on an Apple product, good to go baby, good to go.
[40:46.260 --> 40:55.980]  And the left in America loves it.
[40:55.980 --> 41:00.660]  We're gonna move to the east, to the Horn of Africa and Somalia, the most dangerous
[41:00.660 --> 41:02.420]  backward evil country in the world.
[41:02.420 --> 41:10.660]  And you know why Somalia is so bad, because African countries all around it have driven
[41:10.660 --> 41:17.980]  the Arab slavers in the last thousand years, the Muslim slavers, into the Horn of Africa
[41:17.980 --> 41:23.540]  where it was the center of the slave trade of Africans all over the world.
[41:23.540 --> 41:27.460]  Once the Roman Empire fell, white slaves were the main slave group.
[41:27.460 --> 41:30.740]  Africans that were rich had white slaves, which is because who was trained and where
[41:30.740 --> 41:36.900]  they got slaves was Gaul, that's France today, Germania, which is Austria and Germany, the
[41:36.900 --> 41:43.500]  British and others, they called Gaelic out of what's the UK today, Old Albion, England.
[41:43.500 --> 41:47.580]  But after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Western Empire and the fall of the Eastern
[41:47.580 --> 41:53.380]  Empire and Constantinople, when the Islamists took it, civilization collapsed in Western
[41:53.380 --> 41:56.780]  Europe and there wasn't any good slaves being brought in anymore.
[41:56.780 --> 42:04.380]  And so that Muslims started enslaving Africans over a thousand years ago.
[42:04.380 --> 42:09.500]  And that's why Ilhan Omar doesn't look African, she's an elite Somali.
[42:09.500 --> 42:16.100]  The upper class Somalis are light skinned, they are Muslims and they are slave traffickers.
[42:16.100 --> 42:20.420]  They sell black slaves today to four countries that still allow slavery.
[42:20.420 --> 42:23.620]  It's still customary in several Arab countries to have black house slaves.
[42:23.620 --> 42:26.180]  That's the truth folks, but they don't want you to know.
[42:26.180 --> 42:30.780]  I bet you a lot of money she comes from slavers and you're literally looking at someone that
[42:30.780 --> 42:36.300]  comes from the hub of a thousand years of black slavery.
[42:36.300 --> 42:40.820]  Ilhan Omar guaranteed in her lineage is pure slavery.
[42:40.820 --> 42:45.900]  They ship slaves out of Somalia all the way to Indonesia.
[42:45.900 --> 42:51.660]  And then as you project out towards the east to the far east, you will see all the islands
[42:51.660 --> 42:57.060]  and countries they've taken over in the last thousand years since Islam 1400 years ago
[42:57.060 --> 43:00.060]  went expansionist.
[43:00.060 --> 43:04.060]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[43:04.060 --> 43:07.700]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[43:07.700 --> 43:10.860]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[43:10.860 --> 43:14.300]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[43:14.300 --> 43:16.820]  I'd have doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good.
[43:16.820 --> 43:20.180]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[43:20.180 --> 43:22.900]  shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how
[43:22.900 --> 43:24.500]  great they are and how wonderful they were.
[43:24.500 --> 43:26.300]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[43:26.300 --> 43:30.620]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[43:30.620 --> 43:35.940]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[43:35.940 --> 43:38.540]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[43:38.540 --> 43:42.460]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[43:42.460 --> 43:46.060]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things
[43:46.060 --> 43:47.340]  and a lot of drugs work great.
[43:47.340 --> 43:51.300]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[43:51.300 --> 43:53.340]  God's medicine chest.
[43:53.340 --> 44:00.220]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[46:59.780 --> 47:26.340]  Your listening to the Alex Jones show. Live, raw, and unfiltered. It's the Alex Jones
[47:26.340 --> 47:33.700]  show. I hope all the viewers and listeners understand something, but I think you do.
[47:33.700 --> 47:39.420]  You've got discernment. I don't have a filter. What you see on air is who I am. I would tell
[47:39.420 --> 47:48.020]  you something right now. I'm super pissed at myself. I'm angry at what I've done the
[47:48.020 --> 47:57.500]  last year or so because, well, let me just explain it. When I take the supplements that
[47:57.500 --> 48:01.980]  we sell that are the highest quality, best researched, that are all the missing links
[48:01.980 --> 48:09.060]  of nutrition that the globalist have by design imposed on us so that we are deficient, so
[48:09.060 --> 48:14.260]  that we are dumbed down, so that we are weak, so that we are lethargic. And I myself preach
[48:14.260 --> 48:21.980]  that we should be healthy and prepared. And then I don't do it. I'm not as healthy. People
[48:21.980 --> 48:27.860]  notice that. And then I'm not promoting it as much. Instead, I'm just saying support
[48:27.860 --> 48:34.420]  us, get the products. That's how we fund our operation. That's secondary. If I'm bringing
[48:34.420 --> 48:39.820]  you the best products like DNA Force Plus, I'm about to break down, then it's going
[48:39.820 --> 48:44.620]  to work great for you, and you're going to want to reorder it, which is a 360 win, a
[48:44.620 --> 48:49.940]  symbiotic relationship, a non-zero sum game. And I know the problems. I've talked about
[48:49.940 --> 48:55.460]  it before. Almost eight years ago, I was 80 plus pounds overweight. I was exercising every
[48:55.460 --> 49:00.340]  day, but all the chemicals, the environment, I couldn't lose the weight. I went on X2.
[49:00.340 --> 49:06.660]  I went on the first key products that we promoted that we knew were the best out there, and
[49:06.660 --> 49:11.060]  the weight just poured off of me. But then over the years, I get busy. I'm working hard.
[49:11.060 --> 49:16.460]  I run out of the vitamins and the minerals. I don't have an auto ship set up and then
[49:16.460 --> 49:20.580]  I'm lethargic. I'm not working out. The same thing happens again, especially as you get
[49:20.580 --> 49:27.060]  older. Show about three weeks ago, I religiously began to take X2 every morning. I religiously
[49:27.060 --> 49:32.220]  began to take fish oil every morning. I religiously began at lunch to take my DNA Force Plus
[49:32.220 --> 49:41.020]  that's so critical. And I've already lost seven pounds as of yesterday. I didn't weigh
[49:41.020 --> 49:46.660]  today and my workouts are explosive compared to where they were. I'm doing three times
[49:46.660 --> 49:50.500]  the sets. I'm working out for an hour and a half. The sweat's pouring off. I'm feeling
[49:50.500 --> 49:56.380]  great. I feel like I'm 20 again. And so I'm committing this time. I'm committing. In fact,
[49:56.380 --> 50:02.860]  I want to walk around the room. You guys bring the mic in here, please. Folks, I'm telling
[50:02.860 --> 50:08.500]  you, this doesn't just fund the operation, which is a win-win by itself. This literally
[50:08.500 --> 50:14.220]  empowers Patriots bodies and helps us with the tools God gave us and the evidence, the
[50:14.220 --> 50:19.380]  science is all there. Thank you, Scott. Is it on? Thank you. Before we went on today,
[50:19.380 --> 50:23.860]  I told the crew, please get my mobile mic ready. And I'm going to tell you right now
[50:23.860 --> 50:30.820]  why I did that. I've done live shows before where I just wore a pair of sunglasses. And
[50:30.820 --> 50:34.700]  back when we were on YouTube, we get like three times more views for our sunglasses
[50:34.700 --> 50:38.820]  or cowboy hat because it's out of the ordinary. People ask themselves, what's different about
[50:38.820 --> 50:45.900]  this? So today I decided to get the mic here and you know, stand up because I want to note
[50:45.900 --> 50:54.460]  to everybody, this is special. This is important. I'm 45 years old. When I was 35, I swam to
[50:54.460 --> 51:01.540]  two miles a day sometimes and would jog and couldn't lose weight because I didn't have
[51:01.540 --> 51:07.700]  the missing links. I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[51:07.700 --> 51:11.340]  I knew all about the private federal reserve, the trilateral commission, the new world order,
[51:11.340 --> 51:15.700]  Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile rings. I knew all about geopolitical systems and the old
[51:15.700 --> 51:21.020]  Soviet Union and how the globals put the chycoms in. But I didn't know about PQQ. I didn't
[51:21.020 --> 51:28.340]  know about CoQ10. I didn't know about all this and I didn't know about clean iodine.
[51:28.340 --> 51:33.340]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation. I want you to get products that have changed my life
[51:33.340 --> 51:38.100]  and changed so many other people's lives that have 98% reviews and then experience that I'm
[51:38.100 --> 51:43.300]  not bsing you so that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going
[51:43.300 --> 51:47.260]  to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated. Let me tell you something
[51:47.260 --> 51:53.340]  right now. You see DNA force? I went out to top manufacturers, though the most respected,
[51:53.340 --> 51:59.700]  most highly tested. And I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has
[51:59.700 --> 52:05.580]  pure non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market. And they said, well,
[52:05.580 --> 52:11.340]  that's like a $22 each bottle. I said, I want to put $50 a bottle in it. They said, nobody's
[52:11.340 --> 52:15.580]  ever done that. Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was going to buy. I got
[52:15.580 --> 52:20.300]  it down to $30 something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this. Nobody does
[52:20.300 --> 52:25.380]  that. Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this and you research every ingredient
[52:25.380 --> 52:32.180]  in this and then you experience it for yourself. It's incredible. There's nothing like what
[52:32.180 --> 52:38.340]  God gave us through Mother Nature. There's nothing as strong. And you look at all the
[52:38.340 --> 52:47.020]  things that are in this. LVATP, the number one ingredient in 2008, winning all the awards
[52:47.020 --> 52:51.980]  for increased cellular energy levels and improves athletic performance. CoQ10, we have the best
[52:51.980 --> 52:56.580]  form of it. The ingredient was popularized and studied by Dr. Peter Mitchell and won
[52:56.580 --> 53:01.700]  the Nobel Prize for CoQ10. This is a Nobel Prize winning ingredient. PQQ, we got the
[53:01.700 --> 53:05.780]  best form of that. This ingredient has won multiple awards, including ingredient of best
[53:05.780 --> 53:11.060]  science. There are over 1,000 published studies on PQQ health benefits. You might want to
[53:11.060 --> 53:19.020]  go read them. They make your telomeres last longer. That's the DNA. They literally rejuvenate
[53:19.020 --> 53:25.580]  the cells and the engines in them. And again, I get in the habit of getting so busy, I forget
[53:25.580 --> 53:29.420]  to eat breakfast most mornings. Almost didn't eat lunch today. They're like, hey, you're
[53:29.420 --> 53:36.180]  being a jerk. Eat lunch. I was better after that. You take the X2. You take the X3. You
[53:36.180 --> 53:43.580]  take the bodies too. You take the DNA force because this is the next level. You get a
[53:43.580 --> 53:49.460]  great response from it and you fund the Second American Revolution worldwide. But I want
[53:49.460 --> 53:55.620]  to be clear, whether it's X2 or whether it's DNA force plus, this stuff isn't a game.
[53:55.620 --> 54:02.700]  I chopped my finger off 15 years ago, helping people on the lake whose boat was on fire.
[54:02.700 --> 54:10.300]  Old Kevin Booth was there. It's a long story short. It was quite a fiasco. The finger was
[54:10.300 --> 54:18.140]  still numb until I took the original DNA force five years ago. Feeling came back in it. You
[54:18.140 --> 54:23.700]  can actually say because it's patented that it regrows nerves. Now, that doesn't mean
[54:23.700 --> 54:28.380]  if you broken your back and you're paralyzed, it's going to, you know, reconnect those
[54:28.380 --> 54:33.220]  giant nerves. But I had old back pains and things and old areas that were numb from
[54:33.220 --> 54:37.100]  football injuries where the nerves were so dead, I had no feeling. The back pain came
[54:37.100 --> 54:43.140]  back and then the back pain went away. So what I'm saying is it's not all just roses
[54:43.140 --> 54:48.140]  to have your nerves come back. You need to know PQQ, CoQ10 and the other ingredients
[54:48.140 --> 54:55.180]  in this aren't child's play. This is stuff God gave us. It's powerful. So consult your
[54:55.180 --> 55:00.220]  physician before you take it because it could interact with something else you're involved
[55:00.220 --> 55:05.820]  in because we're not selling placebos. We're not selling snake oil. We're selling the most
[55:05.820 --> 55:11.300]  powerful nutraceuticals on the market because I want to be that guy that puts out the best
[55:11.300 --> 55:15.180]  fish oil. I want to be the guy that puts out the best iodine. I want to be the guy that
[55:15.180 --> 55:21.340]  puts out the best turmeric concentrate. I want to be the guy that when you order the
[55:21.340 --> 55:25.660]  products we sell, you go, man, his info is not just good. His products are amazing because
[55:25.660 --> 55:31.060]  I want a relationship with you and I want to have a better world with you and I want
[55:31.060 --> 55:34.780]  to dominate the globalist and I want you to be healthy because that's what I want for
[55:34.780 --> 55:41.540]  myself and we're all connected and anybody that tells you we're not connected is a Satanist.
[55:41.540 --> 55:48.660]  They may not know they're a Satanist, but Satanism is believing you're alone and believing
[55:48.660 --> 55:52.940]  that what you do doesn't come back on you. Listen, I'm a total individualist, but we
[55:52.940 --> 55:57.780]  are all collectively tied to each other. I believe individual freedom, but not at the
[55:57.780 --> 56:05.980]  expense of others and that's the freedom and the free will God gave us is to be individuals
[56:05.980 --> 56:12.100]  but collectively connected. Not individuals who don't care about anybody but ourselves.
[56:12.100 --> 56:16.460]  So I encourage everybody, learn about the secret history of iodine and the IQ reduction
[56:16.460 --> 56:21.140]  when you don't take it. Learn about PQQ, CoQ10, Reservatol and all the other things.
[56:21.140 --> 56:31.700]  I mean, there's so many that are in our alpha lipoic acid, rhodiola, astragalus, reishi,
[56:31.700 --> 56:36.660]  reservatol. I just don't have time to go over it all and they're all the best, the highest
[56:36.660 --> 56:43.260]  quality and they fund the information war. This bottle could be full of air. It's not.
[56:43.260 --> 56:48.060]  It's full of the highest quality product and it was still fun, a revolution against tyranny.
[56:48.060 --> 56:53.420]  It was still stand up for unborn babies and born babies and our very country's existence
[56:53.420 --> 56:58.180]  but just like our information is powerful, this product is powerful ladies and gentlemen
[56:58.180 --> 57:04.020]  and that's why I'm so proud of it. So know this, when you get DNA Force Plus, it takes
[57:04.020 --> 57:09.220]  a few weeks to kick in just like the iodine because it changes the entire metabolic system
[57:09.220 --> 57:13.260]  in the body from the research that I've done in my own personal experience and it's big
[57:13.260 --> 57:21.100]  medicine, it's big mojo, it's big, it's not globalist crap, it delivers. So check it
[57:21.100 --> 57:26.700]  out today, both products, DNA Force Plus and the high quality iodine X2 and X3, that's
[57:26.700 --> 57:31.700]  three products, they're all 50% off right now so you can experience these. A lot of
[57:31.700 --> 57:35.820]  you have already experienced it. You get great results, you forget about it like I did. Get
[57:35.820 --> 57:39.500]  back on it. A lot of you stay on it. A lot of people haven't tried it yet and they need
[57:39.500 --> 57:44.820]  to experience it right now. InfoWarsLife.com for the X2, the X3 and of course the DNA
[57:44.820 --> 57:51.940]  Force Plus today. During the sale, and of course last night I'm on InfoWars.com and
[57:51.940 --> 57:58.860]  I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice. It is literally the shirt that I envisioned,
[57:58.860 --> 58:03.380]  a Betsy Ross but also another just classic American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden
[58:03.380 --> 58:08.900]  Snake superimposed over it and on the back, America's back, InfoWars.com. But what's better
[58:08.900 --> 58:12.420]  than just an American flag about a don't tread on me under the flag, saying don't tread
[58:12.420 --> 58:15.260]  on the American flag, it's a perfect combo. So great minds think alike, I mean whoever
[58:15.260 --> 58:19.100]  designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar design. It is
[58:19.100 --> 58:24.220]  the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the
[58:24.220 --> 58:28.660]  shirt worn by Chris Pratt. Let it say, you know, battle tattered flag like the one that
[58:28.660 --> 58:35.220]  flew over Fort Sumter and again on the back, it says America's back, InfoWars.com. 4,000
[58:35.220 --> 58:39.900]  of these babies and that's it. So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag
[58:39.900 --> 58:45.700]  version at InfoWars.com. You're printed in the USA right now, InfoWars.com. We'll be
[58:45.700 --> 58:51.100]  right back, the most banned broadcast in the world.
[58:51.100 --> 58:55.060]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[58:55.060 --> 58:59.420]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[58:59.420 --> 59:03.260]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed
[59:03.260 --> 59:07.540]  by some billionaire. That's not being funded by secret foreign government. It is completely
[59:07.540 --> 59:13.180]  independent of all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression
[59:13.180 --> 59:17.300]  of the freedom of press and freedom of speech. That, in fact, the founders were so concerned
[59:17.300 --> 59:21.740]  with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[59:21.740 --> 59:25.160]  just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted. And then ultimately we
[59:25.160 --> 59:29.220]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire
[59:29.220 --> 59:33.700]  sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons
[59:33.700 --> 59:38.660]  allowed to have or express or hear. And the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[59:38.660 --> 59:43.340]  They are the bridge from the use of founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[59:43.340 --> 59:47.260]  and freedom. And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming,
[59:47.260 --> 59:53.380]  defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[59:53.380 --> 01:00:10.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:31.220]  Comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting. And these comments are racist.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:40.300]  The chair will remind all members, please, please do not make comments toward personality
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:44.220]  based or personality based comments.
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:51.860]  This whole Ilhan Omar, the Jihad Squad, all of it really illustrates what a bunch of cowards
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:56.420]  the Republican establishment is and how you turn on any channel. They're saying, well,
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:05.540]  what the president has said is racist and he needs to walk it back. No, Ilhan Omar
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:10.020]  has openly said she doesn't like this country. She said that she's going to teach us how
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.020]  to be patriotic.
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:16.180]  If you go back into the Four Congresswomen, the things they've said about our country
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:23.220]  are terrible. What they've said about Israel are just terrible. I don't know. I can't
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.740]  say for sure, but certainly a lot of people say they hate our country. And I think it's
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.740]  a disgrace.
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:35.820]  And so since the first day, this president introduced the Muslim ban, knowing that the
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:43.540]  country I came from was on that and that my country now was on the track of implementing
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:49.980]  fascist laws. I knew that I had to speak up.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:58.540]  She comes to this country and squats on us and spits in our face. And we're supposed
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:02.980]  to bow down to her. You don't go to Mexico or someplace and run your mouth about how
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:07.260]  it sucks. They say, get the hell out of you don't like it. And that's how any other country
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:13.020]  in the world who isn't totally brainwashed acts. We're not saying get out of here because
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.700]  your background is an Arab slave family, Arab slave traders. We're saying because you're
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:21.980]  an arrogant America hating liar that says we're running concentration camps and our
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:26.740]  overworked border patrol is are Nazis killing children.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:32.060]  Right now the president is committing human rights abuses at the border, keeping children
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:37.820]  in cages and having human beings drinking out of toilets.
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:43.740]  Ilhan Omar goes along with the lie that children are drinking out of toilets. She came here
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:51.180]  as a refugee. She married her brother. She wrote letters to federal judges to get ISIS
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:59.660]  terrorists out of prison. She voted against Bill blocking terrorists from life insurance.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:05.500]  The woman is a cancer. I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:11.420]  now, but I want you all to know that we are not going to let that.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:20.700]  And the crowd was right behind her. To me, she's far more patriotic than the
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:30.060]  people who were at the rally chanting last night. And when I hear that, it makes me afraid.
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.900]  I'm concerned that Trump is building a militia, to be honest with you.
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.540]  Are there folks from Africa that come here that are great people? Absolutely. I've run
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.940]  into people that have immigrated here from Africa who are hardworking, smart, nice people
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.860]  because they know to appreciate a country like the U.S. compared to some of the places
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:52.060]  they've come from. But a lot of people are brought here and have chips put on their
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:57.660]  shoulders by the left and by leaders the Democrats give them like Ilhan Omar.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:04.940]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're live for the rest of the broadcast today. I punched
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:09.860]  out last two segments because I didn't want to go off half cocked with what I was about
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:18.540]  to talk about. So I went and reviewed in the last 30 minutes or so. A lot of court documents,
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:23.340]  a lot of research, made some phone calls so that I could talk about what's currently
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:29.140]  happening because I realized that I've been so busy covering all the other big subjects
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:34.300]  that I've not been so sick of Russiagate. But the criminal investigation of Russiagate
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.020]  and the espionage that was carried out by the deep state, that is a huge story. And it's
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:42.900]  all about to come out in the open. And this also tells us whether Bob Barr is a good guy
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:50.300]  or not. So I'm really ready to lay out some big stuff on the side, other side of this
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.340]  quick break. And these type of things really upset me. It's very sad our country's gotten
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.300]  into this position. Stay with us.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:04.220]  I got a plug for the Patriot points. I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.900]  stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't want to give that
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.340]  money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.100]  to causes I don't believe in. So I'd rather give that money to you. And I'm getting quality
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.540]  products. The products that I do receive have changed my life. I mean, the X2 has really
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.860]  done a lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works a whole lot better. My kids, they use
[01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:27.620]  the toothpaste. My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.060]  it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.740]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in there. I want
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.900]  a good price. But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.980]  50% off. I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off. And so it's the same thing like the
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.180]  fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you so much for the plugs. But listen,
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.260]  when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later because
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.900]  if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50%
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.540]  off. And then you do something like that. We have Patriot points. We lose money, but
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.540]  it's okay. Thanks for the support.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:24.420]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show for now six
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:31.820]  minutes into hour number two on this July 23, 2019 worldwide simulcast of radio and
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:36.900]  TV blasting out over the internet and on M and FM and TV stations across the country
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:45.900]  in the world. The whole situation with the attempt by the entrenched bureaucracy or the
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:52.580]  deep state to keep President Trump from getting into office and then attempting to remove
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:07:01.140]  him from office is the greatest string of arrogant outrageous over the top criminal
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:10.340]  activity and treason and espionage against this nation. And then the subsequent lying
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:17.980]  and perjury and changing of stories is the most spectacular ever seen as well. But the
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:24.020]  country is 246 years old. It's gotten more and more corrupt over time. And as we become
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:29.940]  more powerful, the corruption has become more intense. As Lord Acton famously said, power
[01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:38.180]  tends to corrupt absolute power, corrupts absolutely. So here's the summation and we
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:48.940]  have the live feed named today up on News Wars.com. Deep State caught spying on Trump and stealing
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:57.980]  national security information from the White House. What they did was a crime. And then
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:07.460]  how they would lick the information with lies sewn into it is also extremely criminal.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:17.340]  Now Trump's known all this a lot of this since the head of the NSA at the time came over
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.460]  and visited him when he was president elected Trump Tower and gave him a good idea of what
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:26.300]  was going on. We knew what was going on because we were studying the globalist and their statements
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.060]  and their past activities and they were very arrogant about it when he was president-elect.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:35.220]  They said we've been spying on him. We got proof he's a Russian agent. And Trump said
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:40.820]  well if you did that's illegal show us your proof and went oh we never said that. So there's
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:47.980]  a lot goes into this but here's the big announcement. They haven't caught just one or two or three
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:56.220]  or four. They have caught dozens of people that have been in the White House two and
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:01.900]  a half plus years and even before when he was president-elect who've been actively trying
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:12.020]  to frame and set up the president. That itself another giant crime. And now a particular
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:24.900]  federal judge has been releasing troshes or segments of documents from Comey's blackmail
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:32.980]  diary that show his testimony to Congress was a lie and that show who was spying on
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:39.940]  who and then how they would leak fantastic lies from their quote sources. So I've got
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.020]  several articles here in front of me. Everybody needs to go read but the reason this is a
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:54.740]  big issue is the federal judge is now ordering that it all be released in the next month without
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:10:00.860]  redaction which shows the power structure now knows that Trump has the upper hand. And
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:06.100]  that shows that Bill Barb the former attorney general now the current attorney general reason
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:11.420]  he was confirmed so quickly was the establishment couldn't believe they were putting their guy
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:17.740]  a fixer from the George Herbert Walker days from the CIA not just the FBI. They couldn't
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:23.300]  believe they were putting this guy in but he was there to cover their butt but to sue
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.420]  for peace with Trump but they've not sued for peace they're still trying to take Trump
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:33.820]  out and so bars asking all this stuff be redacted because it exposes the Clintons and Obama
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:42.380]  and the illegal spying and the planting and all the rest of it. So they don't know they
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:49.020]  don't know what to do because the left just can't stop their impeachment they can't stop
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:55.860]  their their fake Mueller investigation tomorrow they can't stop the lie that Trump's a Russian
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:01.140]  agent because that's how they started the fake national security investigation to begin
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:07.300]  with and told people in the CIA and FBI we have proof we're gonna take him out get ready
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:12.060]  including and you're gonna hear this soon plans to kill the president because he was
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:19.580]  a quote Russian asset but a lot of their own people got cold feet when Trump got inaugurated
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.260]  and then when the country turned around and then when they learned that the dossier was
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:29.700]  fake their own people were buying this and that's in all these documents they really
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:36.620]  thought Trump was a Russian agent when the Hillary and Obama or Chai Kham agents and
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:46.980]  that's all illustrated now over the news it's all coming out so they've discovered
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.220]  not just one not just two not just three but a bunch of these people and it's all coming
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:55.100]  out and so that's why they're so panicked in there are multiple I'm told three grand
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:12:06.900]  juries in DC Virginia and Maryland at least that are going to be returning indictments
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:10.100]  against some of these individuals and you need to go read these articles once from
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:15.420]  the last refuge and it links to all the court documents and statements James Comey had designated
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:21.740]  FBI spy in the White House who now works for CNN this report goes through everything I'm
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:28.940]  going to read some of this in a moment Comey's cyber spy in White House stole classified White
[01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:39.260]  House material is now working for CNN and of course his name is Anthony Faronte and
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:46.060]  we can roll some b-roll of him on CNN hosting shows I'd queued that up about 30 months ago
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:57.780]  now this individual is just one of them and he works for the deep state and it comes out
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:04.980]  that he was working with the Italian government reportedly to plant on Italian citizens computers
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:13.100]  that own server companies WikiLeaks info to then plant it in the US to then shut up Trump
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:22.420]  and that's all come out in the Italian courts it's just bombshell information to have all
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:27.060]  of this going on so these individuals decided to set up the president it's decided to frame
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:33.340]  him but there was literally nothing and so this individual was supposedly in the web
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:42.340]  White House advising Trump on national security on cyber security while he was in the Russia
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:47.540]  investigation run by Hillary and her people and Obama in the deep state and again trying
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:53.060]  to then find ways to plant info on the president and these articles go through all of this
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:14:00.860]  it's beyond sensational now now we already know all this but the fact is we now learn
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:10.220]  that Mr. Barr understands this can blow up the whole government so he's in there saying
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:15.100]  Trump did nothing wrong and that's all true they're attacking him but now we learn he's
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:21.380]  actually in there just like I said he was totally and completely protecting Brennan
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:28.340]  Clapper Hillary all of them because they have all the damning evidence of the perjury to
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:32.420]  Congress the illegally spying didn't have authorization from the attorney general to
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:35.900]  do this to the president and the attorney general can't do that even if you say oh we
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:41.180]  think the president's a Russian agent we've got to do this you still go to go to Congress
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:46.980]  for an impeachment or every president would be accused of being a foreign asset globalism
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:52.180]  is a foreign asset globalism is overthrowing the country globalism is saying we can't say
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:57.940]  America or American in colleges or that we can't say that our country is exceptional
[01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:04.620]  and CNN says America sucks these Trump supporters love America they're bad people that's the
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:09.660]  enemy that's the outsider that's the globalist they're the ones that want our economy imploded
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:15.860]  and are trying to implode it you judge a tree by its fruits and the fruit of the democrat
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:22.180]  deep state tree is poison the fruit of the neocon tree is poison total and complete poison
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:28.540]  so we come back I'm gonna run through these court documents and I'm gonna get into what's
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:36.820]  coming out next but the judge has ruled it's all coming out and it's a total blueprint
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:41.460]  a lot of it's already out of treason ladies and gentlemen a blueprint of trying to remove

[01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:58.380]  fervor funded by foreign banks in the chai com so go to info war store dot com before
[01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:03.860]  i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and in force dot com but
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.340]  also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:13.620]  info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:17.540]  now i remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:22.940]  telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the science
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:29.180]  and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.840]  your telomere so i started looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:39.820]  it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:45.900]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went but dna force plus is still
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:51.220]  there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:56.700]  it's expensive so you should take advantage of fifty percent off dna force plus at info
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:03.700]  wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:33.700]  spies have been caught inside the white house working for multinational corporations using
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:45.280]  their government credentials to carry out the fraud and theft massive amounts of national
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:52.760]  security data has been stolen and sold to cnn msnbc and others who then sell the information
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:58.880]  to foreign governments you see globalism itself is espionage against the nation state
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:04.520]  and against the people of the nation state and now federal judges are releasing documents
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:10.320]  that are set to release documents exposing the full criminal extent of how president
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.200]  trump was spied on when he was a candidate when he was president-elect and when he was
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:22.000]  president and how they tried to shut him up and how they perjured themselves to congress
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.080]  this thing is more than coming to a head it's like a volcano when it explodes and this is
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.760]  all being reported right now we have major federal government watchdog groups we have
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:42.080]  federal judges coming out and laying all this out and if you're a team of your we're
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.040]  putting the judges rulings on screen all of it but let me just get into the basic facts
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:54.880]  here because this thing is like a cake that's been baked we heard the ping on the timer that
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:01.280]  lets us know the next shoes about to drop my sources told me a week ago and it just
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.680]  got lost in the haze of battle hey get ready they are going to indict people they got three
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:09.280]  grand juries open and the word is they're getting ready to indict it's why the democrats
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.240]  are so damn scared it's why they're bringing Mueller back he doesn't want to testify he
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:21.400]  knows that his mentor bill bar who brought him in that's who brought him in is has told
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:26.320]  him you need to stop trumps got the royal flush and unless you assassinate him he's
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:32.320]  going to destroy him and the president has been convinced to back off but then they've
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.520]  broken the deal the president doesn't want destabilization he doesn't want this to happen
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:47.520]  to the fbi and the cia but they're hopelessly corrupt sewers at the top this is a long time
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:53.600]  deep state civil war coming to a head i've documents on that as well so real clear investigations
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.360]  uh and others break all this down i've done deep research on this i can tell you it's
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:08.400]  very very accurate and it just lays out how bill bar has been trying to suppress all this
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:17.360]  but now multiple federal judges have ordered that even more of the damning documents come
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:29.200]  out and yes stunningly judge bossburg has ordered the archery declarations to be fully released
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:37.480]  to the public without redactions and it goes through comies notes everything that means
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:45.440]  all those black boxes the example above would have been removed and so now the new groups
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.920]  of documents be released from a whole fake russia gate that's really a blueprint of their
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:54.080]  crimes against the american people and against our electoral process are going to be released
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:02.400]  unredacted and so bill bar tried to protect the power structure but the power structure
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:08.320]  was so hopelessly corrupt and senile and arrogant that they're continuing to attack
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.080]  and so now trump is going on the attack and that's really the big news here there's so
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:19.520]  many things are trumps going on the attack the grand juries are out set to indict i was told
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:24.000]  judges are about to just release it all because if the agencies won't do it trumps got judges
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:32.800]  that will that's happening we've been following every step of this and it's a giant world a
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.520]  giant cosmology to be like if somebody told me described to me the lord of the rings trilogy
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.120]  how do you describe about you know three books thousands of pages well imagine trying to describe
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:49.680]  how big this is but you've all been living it you've all been seeing it when you look at the
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:25:00.400]  arrogance of people like anthony the fbi minion fenetay and the things that he's done and just how
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.640]  they believe that they're invincible and how they can get away with anything they want
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.680]  that's just not the case and again he's been working as a consultant before and after it's
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:18.160]  cnn bringing them the national security goodies because trump would talk about something in a
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:27.520]  meeting and then he'd see it that night on cnn but with lies added to it and so trump started
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:34.240]  planting dis info and then he was figuring out who was in the meetings who was doing it what was
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:43.120]  happening so imagine trying to run a government when you're surrounded by all these people who
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:49.040]  brag oh we don't listen to him oh when he signs an order we just throw it away and hope he
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:55.120]  forgets about it to where trump now has to carry around a little notebook with notes
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.720]  on what he's told to do and he has to go back through that notebook never had to do that
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:04.960]  as a guy running hundreds of properties thousands of properties but he has to do it because in
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.440]  business people get promoted for working hard and being smart and doing their job and being able to
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:16.080]  be counted on in dc they do it for being snakes they get advanced for that that's why it's not a
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:22.160]  swamp it's a giant open-air sewer and you know what they do to everybody who's in us intelligence or
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.800]  who's in the corporate world in dc they call it and they threaten you they threaten your wife
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:32.160]  and they hack into your computers and they find out what investments you have and they start threatening
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.760]  your children at school i'm not the government and i've had this stuff go on and they have been
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:45.280]  harassing thousands and thousands of people hardcore and most people go whoa i'll be a double agent
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:53.280]  i'll claim i'm for trump by day but i'll work against trump by night but the longer trump
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.320]  stays in almost three years now they're out of gas they're tired they know they've committed
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.680]  crimes they know there's grand juries open out there they know that they're under scrutiny they
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.960]  know that the actual people that work and defend the country are on trump's side and they see that
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:15.840]  hourglass almost empty in no time's up that's why the left oh don't regulate big tech because they
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:19.840]  were running it now that trumps about to move in on oh yeah we want to regulate they want to get
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:25.600]  their hands in there to use it to prohibit our speech not have laws that say don't prohibit the
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:31.920]  first amendment protects rights doesn't take them and if we don't have regulations against the censorship
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:37.920]  and against the combines and against the cartels then the chinese communist and the globalist e u
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:43.360]  and others will come in via the vacuum and that's what ted cruise the president now say we've already
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:49.040]  got europe regulating our internet we built it we're not going to let them yes i know how to
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:55.440]  talk to these people and i will tell you we spearheaded the common sense to dc you sit there
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.480]  and take google's money in a couple years it'll be pure chai con the money will even be cut off
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:06.000]  so even if you only care about the money you better take control of these to keep the money flow going
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.840]  dumbass and i'm not calling ted cruise a dumbass the president but i'm talking about the average
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:19.680]  person in congress is a lowly bootlicking follower who was put into power because they climbed up the

[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.680]  us uh a little bit about yourself and i mean you're all over the news what your main mission is
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:37.840]  yeah so my main mission is essentially human rights and lgbtq equality um like i am a transgender
[01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:43.600]  woman and i was really seeking uh gender firming care services when it was so what things like when
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:51.680]  it comes to waxing facials pedicures manicures head massage the whole nine yards and i was pretty
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.400]  distraught to see the level of discrimination that is out there when it comes to people in the
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:05.520]  lgbtq trying to receive gender firming care services it's it's horrible and i did not feel
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:12.720]  right to just let this go um you know when when they are when these providers are willing to do
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:18.800]  services on someone who is a male and not a transgender but an actual male but they're
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:27.040]  unwilling to do it on a transgender woman or even a transgender uh male um that just i don't
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:33.680]  understand that okay can i bring because i've seen articles in the uk where the national health
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.680]  service where a nurse doesn't want to do a pap smear uh on a uh person calling themselves
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:44.400]  transgender i'm not a libertarian somebody wants to say they're a woman whatever but but but what
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.800]  about what about when there's not a a cervix uh that's like saying you know give me a root canal
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:57.360]  but i don't have any teeth yeah it it's it's different um it's different when it comes to things
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:04.080]  like um like gynecology like myself it's a little bit embarrassing but i do have a gynecologist um
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:11.680]  i have been checked um but but when it comes to like but when it comes to people that are that
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:20.560]  do not exactly need that service for example um cervical exams on on rather a biological man
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.840]  that doesn't need that then yeah that that i totally understand uh the refusal service when
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:31.680]  it comes to health like a female doesn't need like a biological female doesn't need to go in and get
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:38.160]  a prostate exam unless she's intersex and or has some sort of some sort of um abnormality happening
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:43.360]  there let me ask you this why do you think all this transgenderism is so hot why is it just
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:47.760]  everywhere every children show every tv program every it's just everywhere you just it's everywhere
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:53.760]  i think it's because we live in a new day and age now you know think they're not the the way
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:37:00.160]  they used to be in the in the early 1990s um people are starting to really really reaffirm
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:05.280]  their gender identity and come out as different genders different gender expression like gender
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:12.720]  queer gender fluid gender nonconforming non-binary you never heard of those terms um about five five
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:20.000]  plus years ago you never heard about this but now as things become more open and more socialized i
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.640]  think i'd say that's when you start to hear more and more and more of um of these cases happening
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:32.480]  sure let me raise this to you i played football i wasn't that good at it uh but i i played football
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:36.000]  i was good enough when i was a freshman to be put on the varsity and get run over and then
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.040]  quit the next year i couldn't handle it uh but i was good enough to get hurt real bad every game
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.800]  but i was i'm not a tough guy but it was still weird to pull my clothes off and you know and get
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.960]  naked around guys and the coaches would walk through and once a year they'd come in and do a test to
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.560]  make sure i didn't have a hernia and you know what the coach would stick his finger you know where
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:38:00.800]  or or the uh the doctor would and i didn't like that and and my daughters are even more squeamish
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.400]  and stuff and you know i have three daughters and sometimes i walk by their room and one of them's
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:09.200]  you know half naked and they freak out oh dad and slam the door like like chris qualmo said a few
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:15.760]  years ago he said like 12 year old girl should be ready to have a transgender man as a woman in the
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:23.360]  shower and if they see his genitals they shouldn't get upset i don't think that's reasonable i do um
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:32.560]  actually because you know there people want to start segregating um uh segregating sex and from
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.600]  from what i see i don't think the average women particularly want to be around a bunch of about
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:47.360]  a round a bunch of swans yes and no yes and no i i i do agree where i do agree where you're getting
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:54.160]  out here i do agree um but i i do agree that everyone has um everyone has equal rights when
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:01.920]  it comes to this and you know if if someone wants to transition um and and be a part of that um of
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:07.360]  that sex or gender then they should have the ability to do so without being uh so i want to be clear
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:12.560]  i don't hate anybody who wants to do anything they want with their their body but at the same time
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:23.040]  i don't want to have to pay for it that's where yeah i i i see where you're getting at um you
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:31.200]  know there there are organizations um in british columbia where i reside that uh the bc got the
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.400]  the government here does pay for gender confirmation surgery they do pay like the medical services
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:43.920]  fund here does pay um does pay for uh sex reassignment surgery and breast augmentation i don't think
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:48.720]  they should pay for breast augmentation for a woman a man a trans i don't think we should pay for a
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:40:00.640]  nose job i know it's you know the way the government sinks here and in regards to um in regards to
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:06.000]  which people should receive which i do have some agreements i do have some disagreements i have
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:15.040]  some very strong um disagreements and that and for example i did write to um our medicine our
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:22.880]  medical services fund which we call msp here um because what i found is um what i found is that
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:30.240]  they will fund breast um or what they call chicken cutlets they will they will fund um basically
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:35.840]  breast mastectomy um plants but the stick on or the ones that go inside of a a broth from a
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:40.080]  secondary patient patient but when it comes to when it comes to someone that wants to uh
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:45.840]  try to get wants to switch genders and doesn't have a full-sized breast they won't cover that
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:49.360]  unless well i mean i think i think if people it should be covered if a woman has a breast
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.120]  removed from cancer if she wants to have that fixed but because you can't because they didn't
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:57.120]  ask for the cancer but but let me ask you this question the latest controversy i saw was on
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:03.360]  news wars dot com and summit dot news trans activists organizes topless swimming session
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.600]  for girls as young as 12 parents not allowed to be present is that an accurate headline
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:16.880]  that is um not exactly not exactly i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna explain what exactly is going on with
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:22.560]  this um event so there was an event um that was planned in the city of langley that was
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:32.000]  unfortunately shut down by um unfortunately shut down by anti-lgbtq activists and i was pretty
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.720]  uh distraught when i saw this you know everyone has a right to to have their own event you know
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:43.680]  being topless is legal in canada the actual event organizers are the ones uh that uh that came up
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.480]  with with this event that being the langley use resource hub to my recollection because they're
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:55.920]  the ones that um that are being asked to call them for info and essentially um essentially with this
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:03.600]  essentially with this the the event proposed that people would be able to be topless from age
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:12.080]  12 to 24 it's all up to their um their discretion and what they want and as you can see um that
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.680]  that's their original event well sure what but what happens if an older person identifies as a
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:27.120]  12 year old you know we have that too right that's true you know we we can't be we cannot be going
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:34.880]  around and policing um policing gender or policing um policing people by their age if someone says they
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:38.800]  are 12 year old what do they say they're blind and dumb drain it when their eyes though should we pay
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:44.320]  for that i'm sorry what about what's about trans able but but i want to like i appreciate you
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:48.480]  coming on i mean most folks you know that we argue with will not actually come on this is amazing
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.680]  show uh and i also want to see if we want to go out on the date so you know see how that
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:59.600]  well they're not that folks stay with us lovely lady imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:05.040]  that in the future universities would be saying don't use the term america or american and that
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.920]  american flags will be seen as offensive and that federal courts would be ruling that it's a hate
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:16.400]  symbol that's all happening the left are fascist authoritarians they're bullies they're criminals
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.960]  and now they're trying to make us take down the american flag they're saying the betsy ross flag
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:26.480]  our original flag is evil when she was an abolitionist but people are fighting back in the symbol war
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:31.760]  in this information war at infowarstore.com they're funding our operation getting great t-shirts a
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.840]  bunch of great designs and standing up to the globalists they're trying to shut down info wars
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:43.840]  a true 360 win so get your betsy ross flags and don't tread on me american flags original designs
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.720]  at infowarstore.com and stand up to the globalists stand up to the tyrants and let them know
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.520]  these colors don't run we're flying them proud
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:01.600]  Robert Barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies and
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.680]  the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.000]  legal for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:14.000]  judges the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.360]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:21.600]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.520]  they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.840]  who ran american politics and ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:34.640]  recover after the great depression the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:39.680]  of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.000]  the original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.400]  manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:52.080]  thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.560]  form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.920]  before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and info wars.com but
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:08.640]  also the products at info wars store.com and there's one product that's offered at info wars
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.640]  store.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when alex
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:20.080]  first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:25.520]  with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:31.520]  improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres so i started looking into dna force
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:37.680]  plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing other
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:43.520]  competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:50.320]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna force plus is on
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:56.720]  sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:05.760]  war store.com info wars the most banned network in the world viewers and listeners i wouldn't be here
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:11.040]  if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen but i wanted to take
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:15.600]  just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.080]  saw those lies against us last week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.560]  were liars you went and looked it up and found out the truth and so i feel very strong and i feel

[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.800]  i'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun but that's not what's important the enemy
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:48.000]  could win we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by god you're being used by god
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:57.120]  this is providence so i salute you and i thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:20.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.760]  jessica yanov is a transgender from canada
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:28.400]  and we only got this segment maybe one more so we got to move quickly here
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.880]  i want to break this down um we have photos uh here in articles
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:43.520]  with you um you know at these events or what are these events where where you're in bathrooms
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:49.360]  and i've got some of the tweets here and some of the things uh that you say here what is this
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:55.520]  activism what are you doing here yeah all of those tweets except for that middle one over there
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:01.920]  and the ones on the right are all fake um essentially so that's why i appreciate you
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:06.160]  coming on because you know you're quite the sensation online this way you get to actually
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:13.600]  say something yeah i don't i still i'm so trying to figure out who did this um i am presuming that
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:20.720]  this is an anti-lgbtq activist um i kind of have my suspicions on who it is but i'm not going to say
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:28.320]  exactly who um because i can't but um but no i didn't write any of that sure sure what did
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:35.920]  you mean earlier by you can't discriminate by age what does that mean well what what i mean by that
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.520]  is like oh i'm going to give an example last night my mom tried to book me for a facial
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:51.520]  and what happened with that is the the person on the other side uh then asked her how old is
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:59.680]  your transgender daughter uh to which she replied 32 and then um both of us were refused service not
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.680]  only um and on on several protected grounds actually and this is going to go before the tribunal
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:14.400]  but um but essentially essentially on family status gender identity expression sex um and
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:20.480]  what's the and also age as well so i'm just asking the question if you're a woman because i'm not
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:24.480]  big into i might have had one pedicure one manicure in my life and i've and i've been on a cruise
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.280]  before my ex-wife and they said hey you want his and hers facials they did this facial put cream
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.800]  on my face and did all this i mean they weren't asking man or woman they just said you want a
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.360]  facial so how does i don't even get how they're like you're on the line i'm a transgender i'm
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.760]  getting a facial and they're like no i mean well exactly the the the problem the problem that we
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:51.440]  have where i reside is there's quite um quite racialized cultural groups here that do not
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:57.760]  believe in transgenderism and they believe that they have the right um they believe that they
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:02.480]  have the right to review service on any basis that they want including that oh let me guess
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:07.680]  because most of i mean like i'd say 70% of the nails and facial stuff is it is it vietnamese or
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:15.600]  asians uh it's kind of a mix it's like like the way i explained it to the tribunal is when you
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:21.120]  deal with things like waxing it's usually vietnamese or east indian um or taiwanese it's you know in
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.920]  their culture they're not or any culture you're not supposed to touch anybody's if you're a woman
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:31.200]  you're not supposed to touch another man's penis unless it's your husband i know but since when
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:37.760]  do we have a penis on our forehead so so i don't understand why would we want to make a woman
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:41.120]  i'm just asking why we want to make a woman if it's her religious or cultural thing
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.080]  that maybe she's a bit has been with one man in her life i mean most even wild women i've known
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.320]  you know right away aren't just ready to jump in the sack well then how do you think a woman
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:58.000]  is ready to touch her i just don't get that but you see here here's the thing if if we start
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:06.960]  refusing refusing people um if we start refusing people for things such as facials just because
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:13.680]  we claim religion then we run into a very very very dangerous president the way you're saying
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:19.440]  facials the case i saw was you wanted a bikini wax on your testicles correct and i also wanted
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:24.560]  an arm wax too and i got refused service because uh because the respondents claimed that they're
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:31.360]  seek and that their husband will not allow them to to do service on a biological man you see this
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:38.640]  is listen i don't want my wife touching other other men's genitals no no no not about the one
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:45.600]  of my wife did bikini waxes yeah okay and what if she did that and then a dude you know a man
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:49.360]  comes in who says he's a woman and then he wants my wife to polish his johnson
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:56.560]  you know in in this day and age with the with the bt human rights code and the kini
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:00.320]  human rights code if someone identifies as a woman they have to receive the gender affirming
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.880]  care services that's uh wow that's a lot you know i don't think this is gonna work out well because
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:09.920]  because here's my deal i don't mind and i don't hate somebody if they are a man who feel like
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:13.360]  they're a woman and their brain might be feminine or something and then there's genetics in it or
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:18.480]  whatever there's some evidence that's going on i don't hate anybody but when they try to make
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:24.640]  other people comport to what they want like like almost all the the sprinting almost all the power
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:29.600]  lifting from australia to the u.s to canada's being won by biological men who have twice the
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:35.040]  size bones twice the muscle on average they even have their genitals so they have testosterone
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:41.520]  well it men biological men are going to win every competition in the world now rendering women's
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:47.280]  sports obsolete whether it's basketball or football or hockey it'll be all biological men
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:52.800]  nice pretty hair nice fingernails but it'll be it'll be biological men and women will be obsolete
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:53:00.080]  in sports is that is that inclusive no and and and that's actually where i i agree with you when
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:06.160]  it comes when it comes to things such as sporting competitions and such and i had i had quite a um
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:13.280]  i had quite a discussion about this with uh the good friend of mine um named lin um especially
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:20.800]  in regards to the article you just pulled up um i don't agree with um i i don't agree with transgender
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:28.560]  um transgender identifying individuals going into sports and winning competitions when they
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:35.760]  still have a heavy heavy heavy level of testosterone and i'm gonna give you an example here uh before
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:42.000]  i transitioned i had quite a uh quite a high testosterone level um and then i started hormone
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.280]  replacement therapy and when you start hormone replacement therapy those those pills essentially
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:53.200]  essentially eliminate your testosterone like what i had as was a level of 14 i now have a
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:54:02.880]  level of 1.2 uh for example on my testosterone so what i do believe is that these these individuals
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:11.440]  can compete if their testosterone levels are below uh below a certain number that being like below
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:18.880]  four or well above the hell but i don't i don't agree i don't agree with um i don't agree with
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:26.000]  transgender females pumping themselves up with testosterone to even get above what um what a
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.200]  biological male would because that gets into risky territory i've heard of cases where people are
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:36.160]  breaking breaking necks breaking bones breaking everything well sir i'll say this i'll say this
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:41.520]  humans change their environment we build our own structures we change ourselves that's a human trait
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:47.600]  but the whole trans movement beyond changing sex is getting us ready for brain chips elan musk uh
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.560]  merging with computers and it's being pushed and so the whole eugenics movement is is using the
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:56.240]  trans movement as kind of a way to open the door but but but let's go into this and i appreciate
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.960]  you joining us what about some of these other articles i mean describe to me where are you you
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:06.880]  say you're in a bathroom or is that fake too where you're where you're taking photos of women or young
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:14.240]  young women inside bathrooms that photo that you obviously referred to was taken literally um
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:22.560]  literally like the day that i switched my um my gender to legally the female um i was stupid and
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:29.680]  i shared that on a group um i actually shared it on a group that i kind of knew i would get attacked
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:36.320]  but i did it anyway because i was stupid uh what essentially happened with that is what you see there
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:41.680]  if people took it and they it was something like called the rent room if i remember correctly so
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:52.000]  so did you tweak this right here nope nope not at all but you did take the photos why would i
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.400]  that's the thing okay well i'm sure you're familiar are you familiar with the work i do
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:05.280]  i am so so so why did you decide to come on here because let me tell you nobody on the
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:09.680]  left or whatever you want to call it will come on here they come on tucker show and
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.400]  you know i just want to hear what people have to say because you know i'm not ashamed of who i am
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:19.200]  and that's why i i i watch your show and that's why i thought you know i'm gonna come on this
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:25.840]  show because there's a lot of issues here there's a lot of serious issues that come on play and the
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.400]  the most serious issue and the reason for all these complaints is
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.560]  this is not about what boxing this is not essentially about gender frame of care this is
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:42.000]  about the ability for someone to refuse service because to anyone that they want because because
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.680]  of what they want even if that person belongs to a protected class for example if you have
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:55.440]  if you have a cop that walks into a donut shop and the donut shop owner says no i don't want
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:59.680]  to serve you because you're a cop that would technically be sure that's wrong but but but
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:08.160]  it's not it's not if the cop walked in and said wax my my male genitals i'm a woman that would
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.440]  be different but okay let me ask you this what what what what's your what's your perspective on
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:19.840]  being rejected for um an arm wax like literally something that is sticking out there everyone
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:26.160]  sees it it's not hidden in your in your pants what's your um what's your but if if the vietnamese
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:32.480]  women have had one man they've been with i mean women even if a woman's a slut she doesn't just
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:36.480]  randomly want guys to pull their ding dong out they want to be involved they want to be in
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:41.440]  charge they want to be in control it's a power thing to make a woman shave your testicles
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:46.320]  and wax your ding dong is abusive in my view come back i want to get your take on that

[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:55.280]  hey i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:00.080]  out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:04.640]  i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:09.600]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:13.520]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:17.360]  think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be praying my friend i agree
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:21.040]  entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:26.080]  but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.320]  i would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:35.840]  gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:40.160]  others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:45.200]  does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for
[01:59:45.200 --> 02:00:01.120]  liberty thank you sir for calling you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:13.600]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:24.080]  jessica yana is a transgender male to female and he's coming on the show so i'm being nice here
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:30.160]  but we've got a esthetician here that's it's also trained to be a producer doing a great job
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:35.520]  becca and she was explaining that what you're trained to do she says she's done you know laxing
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:40.240]  of men men get that it's totally different you got to be trained that's a whole other issue she's
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.840]  going to pop in in a moment but what about these articles that that say you're just a predator that
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:52.240]  wants to get around uh young girls what about exclusive 15 year old alleged victim uh of you
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:57.920]  supposedly speaks out it's a big article out of the post millennial you know you're going to these
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:02.880]  courts you're saying these people are abusing you not laxing you but other people are stepping
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:07.600]  forward saying that hey you know we're being harassed by this person what what's your take on that
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.920]  you know uh you know one thing i want to say about the post millennial is um it's to my understanding
[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:21.440]  that the that the council the the the owner of the law firm that is counsel to the respondents own
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:28.000]  supposed millennial.com they have published the found material articles about me day in and day out
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:34.160]  but i i really want i really want to get to something important here because i do believe
[02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:40.080]  that this is important you know going back to the refusal of service you know they they're
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:46.640]  essentially saying that you know we won't do service on a man or transgender but transgender also
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:58.000]  means uh female to male i have a friend her name his name is um is taylor and he you know he he's
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.400]  female to male so what's essentially how happening here is they are also refusing service on
[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:10.960]  transgender males that being ones that also have 100 percent. Well let me raise this you have record
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:17.040]  levels of autism and record levels of suicide mental illness and transgendered a lot of people don't
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:23.840]  want to deal with a mental health issue. What do you mean? Well you're you're you're actually well
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:29.120]  spoken and and holding your own but i mean a lot of times you see a crazy transgender bank robber
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:34.080]  or the men i mean the statistics are there that there are a lot of autistic people and stuff that
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:39.920]  that uh end up getting tricked when they're young to being quote other sex let's bring in Becca uh
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:45.120]  who is a uh you know skin expert that's what an esthetician she wanted to say something go ahead
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.800]  hey Jessica nice to meet you hey hi so working as an esthetician for 10 years and actually worked
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:59.680]  in san francisco so i had a lot of male clientele uh gay people straight people transgender i've done
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:05.840]  it all and and i know i was actually pretty rare in the industry there's not a lot of people that
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.440]  do that type of service i'm just wondering if it's an actual discrimination issue or if you're
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:17.200]  just encountered someone who was not trained in that service i mean it is quite different there's
[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:23.360]  a lot of different training involved how do you consider that well i've i've approached 16 different
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:32.080]  places of asking for waxing and every single one of them refused service now i i do want to see
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:40.160]  like i do have an expert witness um joining me for my hearing on the 26 um that is an uncontested
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:43.680]  hearing that's clumped with three people but but hold on we got to have you back on you're on the
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:48.160]  war room today i think Becca should go on with oh and short to keep the discussion going just let
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:54.160]  me just say this isn't it a first world problem that you're having to sue over uh women won't
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:04:00.880]  wax your your your tallywacker there is there's one really important fact here that i want to
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:08.240]  bring up and i want Becca to affirm that that a brazilian is not um a brazilian it's not gender
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:14.480]  um gender assigned meaning it's not it's not implicitly female as Jessica would you wax my butt
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:22.560]  what what a brazilian wax means what a brazilian wax is it's a it is a wax from the belly button
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:28.000]  down to the anus and it's removing i can't do this anymore hold on you're going to be on the
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.080]  war room right you agree to come on with Owen shroyer uh you're coming up in a couple hours on
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:38.080]  there right i'm sorry you're going to be on Owen shroyer show yeah i am okay Becca you want to

[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.000]  this is going to continue in four wars dot com four slash show lord moch that's coming up thank you
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:00.960]  Becca i talk about this on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.880]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:09.200]  the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:12.960]  are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on our experts to explain why
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:17.120]  they were so good and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:20.240]  shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:25.200]  and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:31.280]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:35.440]  that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.000]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.840]  tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:48.240]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:54.880]  god's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:26.960]  well joining us is lord christopher montan and without him we would definitely have a global
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:34.240]  carbon tax will be the heart of a world government surveillance control and taxation system with courts
[02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:39.840]  empowered to shut down businesses you name it well there's been some huge scientific studies that
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:44.160]  have come out in the last month that have gotten almost no attention i've seen four of them and lord
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:48.640]  montan is going to be in dc for a critical meeting he takes off tomorrow he's going to be there friday
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:52.160]  we're going to be talking to him then we're going to be getting the latest throughout the weekend
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:58.080]  but i really appreciate him coming on to give us an update on the latest because if it wasn't for
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:04.240]  lord montan and if it wasn't for some of the other folks that are out there we would be up the creek
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:10.000]  without a paddle and his best website is what's up with that dot com so lord christopher montan
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.080]  thank you for helping us not already be in a new dark age well alex it's wonderful to be with you
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:24.560]  again and uh yes i will be in washington dc at the trump international hotel i arrived there
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:32.640]  tomorrow and i speak there at the lunchtime keynote speech at the 13th heartland international
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:39.360]  climate conference and this is a great gathering of the clans all the gallant climate scientists who
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:45.200]  have put up with the vilification of the hard left over the years and have continued quietly to do
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:52.880]  their research they'll all be there so if you haven't booked yet then get on to heartland.org
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:57.040]  and make sure you make a last-minute booking and get yourself to the trump international
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:03.360]  hotel washington dc the conference starts at eight in the morning on thursday the 25th and runs all
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:09.040]  day and i'll be speaking at lunchtime i've got the half hour lunchtime slot and what i'll be doing
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:15.120]  alex is explaining to the eminent climate scientists and researchers who are there
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:23.760]  that a team of 10 scientists led by me including three professors has identified and can now prove
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:31.280]  that the climate scientists made a mistake 40 years ago it was actually a communist at nasa
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:36.640]  who made the mistake we've tracked it down who it was and how he did it and that mistake means
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:42.560]  that they have multiplied all their mid-range best estimates of how much global warming we might
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:50.560]  cause by three so if you correct for the error the global warming problem disappears and in my
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:57.120]  half hour talk tomorrow i'm going to be explaining just enough about what we found so that any
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:02.720]  scientists looking at it can go and check with his colleagues and say are these people right
[02:09:02.720 --> 02:09:07.680]  or aren't they and the answer is going to be well we certainly can't rule it out
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:12.480]  we think we're very close now to bringing this whole climate scare
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:17.280]  finally to an unlimited well that's very exciting but i want to get the 35 000 foot view as well i
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:23.840]  also saw articles out of nasa the last year where they went actually carbon dioxide is helping plants
[02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.800]  grow and actually the temperature looks like it's actually not just stopped it's slowing i mean i
[02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:35.440]  suddenly see nasa uh basically agreeing with all the mainline scientists this is a very interesting
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:40.640]  development for some time nasa satellites have been showing and you've got the slide up there now
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:47.840]  that uh the earth is greening and this this is called the net primary productivity of plants
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:54.240]  which is a long phrase for the total mass the total biomass of all the trees and plants on earth not
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.600] withstanding all you hear about deforestation and land clearance and so on there is actually
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:04.720]  more green stuff about 15 to 30 percent more depending on which research paper you when i used
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:09.760]  to come to austria to visit my grandmother it looked like a desert it looks like the brazil now
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:15.360]  well this of course is the wonderful thing what is happening is that the co2 in the atmosphere
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:22.880]  was too little to be good for uh plants and now they're beginning to be able to breathe more easily
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:26.960]  and this has two effects you've got some very good illustrations there on the screen
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:32.960]  it has two effects the first thing it does is that it fertilizes the plant co2 is plant food
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:40.160]  you won't hear this from greenpeace and all the the communist extremists but co2 is plant food
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:46.560]  the the the carbon in the tree trunks for instance doesn't come from the ground it comes from the co2
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.760]  in the air and there was almost not enough of it there so the fact that we've now pushed up the
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:57.760]  concentration of co2 by about 40 percent over the last 100 years plants and trees are absolutely
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:02.000]  loving this because that's what makes them and that's how the lord works in mysterious ways
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:06.720]  talk about this they've studied mars they probably lost its atmosphere in its oceans
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:10.240]  because it couldn't hold them in and we would have gotten in that position i mean we weren't
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:14.880]  one of the lowest points of co2 in history correct until this little bump this was a this was a god
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:19.760]  that's why it had been declining for four million years and had it gone on for another couple of
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:26.080]  million years at its present rate of decline all trees and plants on earth would have died
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:32.480]  we have now by putting 40 percent more co2 back into the atmosphere from which it originally came
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:37.760]  and when it was there the planet didn't fry now all the plants are thanking us for that and that's
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:43.600]  key it was stored under the it was stored in the crust we now bring it back up and reboot the planet
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:52.080]  that's got to be god well it is it is certainly carrying out god's work let's say we are restoring
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:58.240]  what the what nature had begun to take away and we're making it possible for life to continue
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:03.520]  and flourish much more luxuriously on earth than it could otherwise have done and you're quite right
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:10.000]  i mean we just take the sahara for instance as far back as 1981 nicholson et al a team of scientists
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  reported that 300 000 square kilometers of what had been sandy desert had been turned green by the
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.120]  extra water vapor in the air which you get if the air gets a little bit warmer worldwide
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:29.840]  this extra water vapor helps the plants and likewise when there's more co2 in the air
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:35.440]  the stomata which are the little mouths on the underside of the leaves which allow the plants
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:40.640]  to breathe in the co2 but they also lose water through their stomata they don't need so many
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:45.520]  of them and the plants are already adapting by growing fewer stomata because there's now
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:51.440]  more co2 that means they lose less of the water they do get when it rains and that means you get
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:58.320]  a double effect of preserving plants and trees in areas where it was only 40 years ago far too
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:03.040]  arid for them to survive and that's so critical that means you'd drought areas higher co2 and
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:07.680]  i've seen the studies was like some plants can have half as much water i was reading as long as
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:13.520]  co2 is a little bit higher and they don't die if we could if we could double the co2 in the air
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:19.200]  drought virtually worldwide would cease to be a problem it's already declining quite sharply
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:24.880]  i mean the palmer drought severity index which measures the overall severity of droughts around
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:31.920]  the world hasn't changed in a hundred years but what has changed in the last 40 years is that the
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:40.880]  area of land under drought has declined there's less and less drought happening and the reason for this
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:46.560]  is the co2 in the air well sure when i said god i meant god's master plan ward montan
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:51.920]  looking back on this how carbon is stored you know from all of the alluvial things that have been
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:57.280]  deposited by the plants and animals in life that's died the producing crude oil we then
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.640]  discovered 150 years ago pump it up put it out right at the time that we're starved for this
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:07.840]  critical you know one fourth of the life cycle on the planet in the carbon cycle water what what
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:13.280]  sunlight carbon dioxide oxygen and then now we're terraforming the planet back to a better place and
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:20.000]  as you said it's mainstream news that the sahara is now being reclaimed by greenage that's exactly
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:26.240]  it that's a very large areas of the sahel which is the southern sahara really dry one of the poorest
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:31.920]  places on earth because it was so dry is now beginning as it was seven thousand years ago until
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:36.960]  about seven thousand years ago when the nile dried up that was one of the most luxuriant places on the
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:43.520]  planet now look at it so this we're now putting back the co2 we're therefore putting back the
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:47.600]  plants and trees in areas where they never have been before and they're self seeding we're not
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:52.160]  actually going out into the sahel and planting them they're finding their own way there just as
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.880]  they have countless countless times before throughout the long and ancient history of this
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:02.160]  planet and what people are beginning to realize even nasa is beginning to wake up to the fact
[02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:07.520]  that if you go on and on and on beating this global warming drum you're missing the most
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:15.440]  important half of the story which is that co2 is actually good for us it's good for plants it's good
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:22.000]  for all life on earth and we want more of it and not less of it professor will happen at princeton
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.720]  has been making this point for a couple of decades he as you know is the man who is advising
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:32.320]  president trump on climate change strategy and he is saying to him you do not need to take any
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:38.880]  measures whatsoever to restrict the amount of co2 going into the air indeed not only do you not
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:44.800]  need to do that you should not do that because the extra co2 is good for everyone it's glad
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:49.120]  works a mysterious way stay there lord mocked it i mean the earth is starving for co2 then we

[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:56.880]  or chris romontons our guest and he's in dc tomorrow giving a speech from hotel uh i wish i could go i've got family stuff i gotta take care of and some things here but i'd love to fly him down invite him down to come out of austin co-host with us uh here in the next few days uh but just just pulling back from this you're always a scientist you were margaret thatcher's chief advisor on science uh some said her chief advisor total you've been around a long time you're a famous inventor
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:10.560]  you're a successful businessman you parachuted into climate accords in durban south africa when they were censoring you've been beaten up in you know paris at at at climate accords i mean i mean i mean the left's really trying to shut you down
[02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:22.160]  but you you keep arguing about science obviously climate changes obviously things are going on they want control of all human activity they want to make industry able so they can tax and control it
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:34.800]  and the world's woken up for this because china india nobody else will sign on to it but but what is the current state of their scams what is the current state of their power grab because you can keep state and all these studies you know showing all their claims are a fraud
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:43.680]  i think the world knows it's a fraud and we should go after them for the fact that they have developed a fraud and that they're trying to outlaw people questioning them
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:58.880]  let me pick up on this word fraud because that alex is exactly what it has become i mean what happened when we first submitted our paper explaining this huge error right at the heart of climate science
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:07.200]  to a leading journal i won't say which one so as to spare its blushes and it looks as though the police are going to have to be called in to start investigating some of this
[02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:21.520]  the first thing that he was they said we can't find anyone competent to review this paper well that was nonsense so we said come off it it's your job to find people competent to review the paper and if not we can supply plenty of names on both sides of this debate
[02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:31.120]  who would be competent to review this paper so they gave up on that one and then they they sent it out for review and after six months they had got precisely two reviews alex one of them said this
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:41.120]  i do not like the conclusion that this paper comes to therefore i have not read the paper and i have not read the equations justifying the conclusion
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:56.800]  that was supposed to be a scientific peer review the other one said i have not reviewed the main paper at all i have read an ancillary paper with an experiment where we had demonstrated how this works by building a test rig
[02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:08.800]  and he said oh the experiment wasn't done right well it was but it was done by one of our national laboratories so so we wrote to the editor and said look this isn't good enough
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:19.800]  we want to appeal against this so he said okay you can send the paper back to me for review so we spent another few months trying to see if we could stiffen it up to stop this kind of thing happening
[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:35.800]  we sent it to him again and got no reply we sent it to him another time and we got no reply they have that hope that there's total 100% consensus that we're all going to die AOC says the earth ending in 12 years it's just insane
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:57.800]  all of this is nonsense i mean alexandria occasio cortez she is of course a former barkeep and is therefore no expert on the climate or anything else much and the new slogan which i understand that the republicans are adopting is make alexandria bartend again
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:15.800]  because her green new deal is heroically absurd and as you were saying earlier alex this is indeed about concentrating all power over every tiny aspect of every person's life in the hands of the far left
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:31.800]  did they get this idea they got it from a particular division of the european far left called the national socialist workers party of germany the nazi party if you ever read mind camp which is deeply unpleasant oh that's where the that's why he
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:37.800]  loved IBM because hollerith and the machines could could track every human activity the nazis wanted to do that
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:49.800]  all of that but the other thing that they wanted to do was to invent an environmental policy they were the first and they didn't want to do it because the environment was at risk after all it's been around for four and a half billion years
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:25:07.800]  he said to control populations we've got to control people and hitler actually says so explicitly in mind camp the idea was then picked up by the russians they then began particularly when the Berlin wall came down and they still wanted to influence the west
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:25.800]  they began funding the anti-fracking groups in britain for instance because putin is trying to sell gas from Siberia which is his only major source of income from overseas that's what putin is making his fortune out of
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:36.800]  and they want to be able to go on selling gas to the european union whose commissars they control effectively so that the commissars make sure that most countries in the european union are obliged
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:49.800]  i agree lord monson we're out of time i want to invite you back on for a full hour soon just briefly you got to come on again about the geopolitics about trump about where all this is going just how would you in 60 seconds break down the
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:26:03.800]  the makeup of what's happening in the world right now a revolution by populace and nationalist against globalists well that's exactly what's happened with trump it's now happened here in the uk today because Boris Johnson has thank goodness
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:17.800]  become our prime minister at last he nearly did three years ago we wish he had he is now our prime minister thank heavens and he is going to fight the globalists in the EU just as mr trump is fighting fighting the globalists at the
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:34.800]  EU he's going to do what they didn't do i'm sorry he's going to do what they didn't do he's very determined to make sure that we leave the european union parliament is very determined to stop him but the people voted for brexit and he is going to do his level best to make
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:47.800]  sure that what the people voted for they actually get whether parliament likes it or not and if parliament stands in his way this is going to be a metaphor for the rest of the world fighting this ghastly socialist
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:58.800]  totalitarian blob we're going to go and get them we're going to defeat them and we are going to leave the EU and other countries will very swiftly follow
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:09.800]  beautiful please come back on as soon as you can and godspeed with a speech tomorrow the invitation to fly to austin is open thank you lord christopher montan again the best websites what's up with that dot com thank you
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:11.800]  bless you
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:16.800]  all right i forgot to plug last hour ladies and gentlemen we don't plug we're not going to be here

[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:56.800]  a lot of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship and then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that we have patriot points we lose money that's okay thanks for the support
[02:31:56.800 --> 02:32:12.800]  last night i'm on info wars.com and i read chris pratt criticized for t-shirt choice it is literally the shirt that i envision a betsy ross but also another just classic american flag all 50 stars with the gads and snake superimposed over
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:25.800]  and on the back americasbackinfowars.com but what's better than just an american flag about a don't tread on me under the flag take don't tread on the american flag it's a perfect combo so great minds think alike i mean whoever designed that shirt we'd already come up with the exact same similar design
[02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:36.800]  it is the don't tread on me american flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by chris pratt but it's a you know battle tattered flag like the one that flew over fort sumpner
[02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:55.800]  and again on the back it says americasbackinfowars.com 4000 of these babies and that's it so we've got the betsy ross version and the american flag version at infowarstore.com you're printed in the usa right now infowarstore.com we'll be right back the most banned broadcast in the world
[02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:19.800]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:45.800]  well we had jessica yanavi or however you say it on earlier she's going to be back on the war room today and that should be interesting we got into a lot of it we kind of dodged the question she dodged the question about why are you trying to organize 12 year olds to meet topless at a pool that parent shouldn't be there
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:34:12.800]  sounds like pedophilia i mean i brought that up she he dodged it but we'll see on the war room today coming up but for the next hour and 27 minutes or so paul joseph watson identifies as a northern england sheffield patriot is going to be hosting the broadcast and i appreciate that because i've got a lot of fish in the grease
[02:34:12.800 --> 02:34:28.800]  i got a lot of irons on the fire i got a lot of stuff going on that i can't tell you about until it's done but for everything you see in force do that's only the tip of the iceberg the tip of the spear
[02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:50.800]  and your funding of our operation at the tip of the spear so i just want to briefly tell you about this because you know i put this right up together just a few days ago because i want to rebrand things not just say buy our products because you know you need to support us buy our products because when we didn't have iodine in our food the IQs dropped 15 points
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:58.800]  the government added it for a while they went up 15 points now they've taken it out and guess what they've gone down even more than that
[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:13.800]  here are all the mainstream news articles breaking it down so we have x3 that's the deep earth crystal pure iodine and then two other types to help it absorb and we have the x2 it's 50% off even though it's the best seller because i want you to get it and it's not just a gimmick
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:31.800]  it's like hey trumps gonna get elected nationalists are gonna get elected everywhere we're gonna take on the new world order we're gonna turn the tide jerry epstein's a giant you know child pornographer controller blackmailing people for for massage and criminal elements of the CIA it's all coming out
[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:49.800]  i told you the white house is being illegally spied on and how it was happening now it's mainstream news now the indictments are being announced so that's what i'm saying is i don't tell you that iodine is a game changer it is amazing and that you can't find real iodine almost anywhere
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:36:05.800]  that's not made up that's the truth info or store.com enforce life.com and then we get the funding to wreck the globalist future we've already devastated the enemy but they're striking back we just secure a pro human future and we're doing it together

[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:12.800]  thanks Alex yeah i'm continuing to talk about Jessica you need obviously you just had on the show earlier because lo and behold some new information the succulent goblin as he's done
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:27.800]  well she Alex let's let's be careful because she let's respect those pronouns because these people are in control of the world now she has already got two people banned on Twitter for not referring to her as a she so that's what i'm going to do because
[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:48.800]  again this is clown world and these people run it now new information has come out about alleged chat conversations on Facebook between Jessica you need and then 14 year old girl who was about to turn 15 sexually suggestive conversations on Facebook imagine my
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:38:04.800]  shock because we didn't see this coming all along did we and just as she denied being behind those tweets during the interview claiming they were fake she is also claiming that this chat log is fake despite the post millennial
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:20.800]  who came out this story asserting that it's completely true now if they were going to create a bunch of fake posts which basically characterize someone as a pedophile that's going to be a gimme in terms of a lawsuit so i don't know why they would want to create fake posts
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:36.800]  so i'm going to go through that here in the next segment but again to remind people of what this controversy is all about headline up at summit dot news trans activist organizers topless swimming session for girls as young as 12 parents not allowed to be present
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:56.800]  this individual is either one of the biggest predators on the internet or is one of the best trolls on the internet because the history of this controversy stems of course from she Jessica you need filing 15 complaints in British Columbia Canada 15 human rights tribunal
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:15.800]  complaints against female beauticians for their refusal to wax her male genitalia and even prompted the British comedian and free speech advocate Ricky Gervais to wade into the debate yesterday when he tweeted this how did we get to the point where
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:32.800]  women are having to fight for the right to choose whether they wax some big old hairy cock and balls or not is it not a human right to have your meat and two veg polished because that's literally what's happening these beauticians are now in being investigated for their refusal to
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:52.800]  perform a wax on the male genitalia of this self professed Paul that's like the national health service where it said a six foot three bearded man came in and demanded his cervix be pap smeared and the nurse said you you have a male genitals and she got in trouble
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:40:08.800]  oh yeah and of course we're paying for all that as well but it's conservatives and harassing women if we if we spread our legs a little on a subway we're a rapist but if a big old fat dude comes in and tells some poor woman to to give him a pap smear
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:22.800]  yeah yeah we don't know anatomy folks and my man doesn't have a cervix that's that's the open between the vagina and the uterus this is where is this going Paul it's all pedophilic we know that
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:38.800]  these people are now in charge of public discourse this is where it's going and this is this this is the effect of it you see here with the man spreading chair she actually designed another chair that encouraged women to do what she's complaining that the men are doing of course we don't have a conversation about bag
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:54.800]  spreading where women place their bags on seats on public transport which I would argue happens way more than man spreading she was given an award and praised for her social justice justice activism for creating this hideous looking chair which is absolutely
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:41:14.800]  abominable abominable they see the bag spreading controversy on Twitter that's not being addressed but again going back to this Jessica and Eve taking photos of herself in female locker rooms and then the comments below or quote if there's like 30 girls in change rooms how many of them would you say are out there
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:34.800]  changing freely with their vaginas and boobs out she denies making those comments despite the fact that literally dozens of them that are very similar dozens of tweets directed at children asking how old are you and these have been circulating for a while before this even came out over the weekend with
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:55.800]  the beauticians being investigated by the human rights tribunal so this is all being circulating for a while because he had Lindsay Shepherd the free speech activist banned on Twitter a few days ago after you need basically started body shaming her and talking about intimate health
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:09.800]  problems you're going to talk about that when you come back Paul but let me ask you this question why do you think this individual is coming on my show and on the war room and says that they're a listener I think this is some damage control
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:26.800]  it's either damage control or it's the biggest troll you've ever seen Alex just obviously Jessica and Eve was on an Irish radio show earlier today and apparently hung up when she was challenged the fact that she would agree to go on your show raises a lot of alarm bells in my mind
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:35.800]  but again I'm going to get into this new angle on it after the break which makes it even more disturbing from the angle of child grooming and we're going to get into that
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:54.800]  and you're welcome to come on the war room when he joins us I mean she joins us do you want to bow to Jessica Paul yeah let's do it sir we'll be back ladies and gentlemen info wars dot com tomorrow's news today
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:43:05.800]  the globalist are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats they are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions
[02:43:05.800 --> 02:43:13.800]  it's the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods and we're fighting them hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:24.800]  but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from fourslife.com I couldn't do it

[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:35.800]  the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to

[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:24.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show broadcasting live from the UN stronghold Austin Texas you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:33.800]  and we are live talking about Jessica you need who was on the show earlier you've got to commend her for coming on the show and having
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:53.800]  on intended the balls to speak up and defend her trans activism the latest latest example of which involves organizing a swimming session for girls as young as 12 at which it specifically says their parents and guardians are not allowed to be present a trans
[02:47:53.800 --> 02:48:08.800]  activist who gained notoriety for attempting to force beauticians to wax their balls and penis is now ranging a swimming session for girls as young as 12 where parents will not be allowed to be present this is happening or it was going to happen I think the
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:23.800]  first one was cancelled and then they she was trying to organize another one at the Al Anderson Memorial pool in Langley British Columbia Canada the promotional material for the event states parents and or caregivers are not permitted in the event
[02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:38.800]  whether that's going to go forward or not remains to be seen but this is clown world and Canada is the epicenter of clown world so nothing surprises me at this point it takes a lot to shock me these days but my word
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:58.800]  so the latest development is this story up on the post millennial dot com website exclusive this came out literally an hour ago 15 year old alleged victim of Jessica you need speaks out well who didn't see this coming now it's important to state from the
[02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:16.800]  outset that Jessica you need denies this story and denies that she was behind the conversations mentioned in this article just as she denied that she was behind the tweets when Alex was interviewing her earlier
[02:49:16.800 --> 02:49:31.800]  very easy get out clause that isn't it says a young woman has come forward with with serious allegations of abuse against Jonathan Jessica you need you need the male to female transgender has recently risen to infamy for the human rights tribunal suits she's taken out in
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:48.800]  16 estitians declining to perform waxing services on her male genitals we talked about that earlier but now 20 year old Jessica Rumpel of Samanish Washington State has disclosed details to the post millennial of her encounters with Jessica you need
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:50:03.800]  guess what her encounters were with Jessica you need well Rumpel was just 14 years old at the time of the interactions just about to turn 15 and if you were pull up this article you can see the actual conversations again
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:19.800]  denied by Jessica you need she is claiming that these are fake messages the post millennial asserts that they're very much real they come from the official trusted nerd Facebook account of Jessica you need and I doubt they would
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:35.800]  I'll blase just publish obviously fake messages and obviously put them at risk of a of a winnable eminently winnable lawsuit for Jessica you need so as you see up on screen now Jessica you need says lol how old are you again
[02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:51.800]  respondent Jessica Rumpel responds 14 you need says I don't know if I should lol almost 15 I don't know and it goes on from there so this 14 year old 14 at the time said at first I thought you know this guy seems to
[02:50:51.800 --> 02:51:07.800]  have some kind of mental issues of some sort really do you think she says I didn't think he was a predator at first really well he opens up by asking how old a child is and continues to talk to him on Facebook in a sexually suggestive manner as we'll see
[02:51:07.800 --> 02:51:23.800]  in a moment you need made contact with Rumpel through social media site ask FM where people including those who are anonymous can ask questions of users and receive answers in short form Rumpel states that you need sent her a series of disturbing questions while anonymous
[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:39.800]  before adding her to the private messenger application kick K I K which is known to law enforcement for his notoriously poor protection of children basically the app of choice for pedophiles just by coincidence
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:53.800]  according to Rumpel you need allegedly presented himself as a young male in his late 20s and claims that he's pictures of himself when he was younger in their initial conversation and in fact elsewhere other people are claiming that
[02:51:53.800 --> 02:52:09.800]  Jessica you need contacted them during this same time period and claimed to be a 17 year old boy the article continues Rumpel states it was sympathy that caused her to continue contact with you need initially he liked to make himself be the victim he
[02:52:09.800 --> 02:52:27.800]  actually told me he had folliculitis whatever that is and depression and you see this over and over again with people like twitch streamers with youtubers who get online invent a mental illness that they've got and ask for money and beg for attention
[02:52:27.800 --> 02:52:45.800]  this is the new rampant narcissism fueled by social media but according to this the allegation is that Jessica you need used it basically to groom children as we shall see pitting who she thought was an emotionally pained young man Rumpel maintained some regular contact with you need
[02:52:45.800 --> 02:53:01.800]  she said I always wanted to be there for anyone who is suffering anyone who needed someone to listen to them just like any other 15 year old girl she enjoyed having another friend to talk to but the conversations often took an uncomfortable turn
[02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:19.800]  so Yannive obviously has some weird fetish obsession with female sanitary products the alleged victim says Yannive always told me he uses pads and wants to go into the ladies bathroom as we saw with the tweets that seems to be a constant obsession but of course they're fake too apparently
[02:53:19.800 --> 02:53:35.800]  Yannive asked me how to go into the ladies bathroom without being caught and then how to be in the bathroom if there's a lot of women or girls and as we saw before there are selfies that this Jessica Yannive individuals has took in female changing rooms
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:57.800]  so the conversation continues and it's basically Jessica Yannive asking if she with male genitalia of course can get changed in front of young women and girls in a female locker room according to Rumpel the alleged victim Yannive did not identify as transgender at any point during their interactions
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:54:13.800]  now of course if you look at the screenshots of that chat now it shows Jessica Yannive locking or presenting as a female because of course that's what happens on Facebook even though the conversations old several years old in fact I think five years old
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:31.800]  the profile picture is still going to show up as the current profile picture so that's why it does that the victim continued she believed Yannive simply had a fetish for bathrooms, pads and girls clothing as Yannive would also be in sending Rumpel worrying messages including photos of himself in girls jeans
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:51.800]  asking for comments and compliments from the then 15 year old so as you can see there the Jessica Yannive is sending pictures of herself in what she claims are women's jeans and asking if they look okay another absolutely bizarre example of this conversation
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:55:07.800]  eventually and nobody saw this coming Yannive's attentions turned overtly sexual Yannive said I'm so OMG you know the respondent of 14 year old girl asked hungry question mark
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:17.800]  Yannive said it rhymes with that and then the 14 year old said tawny question mark then Yannive said why are you always so beautiful
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:27.800]  the next conversation is the 14 year old asking did you also ask me if I had big boobs and big ass on anal
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:40.800]  Yannive admits the first thing yes so if that's true and Yannive says it isn't but if it's true it's Yannive literally asking a 14 year old if she has big boobs
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:53.800]  absolutely plan well disgusting this this is the person who is now in control of this discussion this is the person who's already got two people banned on Twitter for daring to argue with them as we should see in the next segment
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:56:05.800]  I don't even know how much of this I can read on air Yannive called me Titty Queen even asked me to marry him and I was only 15 he said he couldn't wait until I turned 16
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:17.800]  Yannive was born in 1987 he's currently 32 so at the time of these messages he would have been 27 of course in other conversations he's presenting as a 17 year old boy
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:27.800]  so it goes on I can't wait till you turn 16 said Yannive but you're not 16 and that means I can't do anything with you as much as you want that am I right
[02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:39.800]  so again if true that is directly grooming a child in a sexually suggestive manner that is the allegation here and it says as has been revealed from previously exposed conversations
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:50.800]  Yannive often directed his comments towards menstrual stuffs even going so far as to pest a rumble to take photos of her using feminine hygiene products
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:57:00.800]  again I'm just reading this before I actually read it on air to see if I can actually read it there's another video there which I didn't pull but I've listened to it earlier
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:10.800]  and it's basically Yannive adopting this bizarre high-pitched childlike voice what he or she called an Elmo voice saying things such as
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:21.800]  Elmo wants to F and Elmo loves P-U-S-S-Y in the final clip Yannive is heard saying I love you your boobies go up and down, up and down, up and down
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:29.800]  and I've played that and it's disturbing. Rumpel explains that Yannive had an Elmo character profile on Ask FM and used it to send her questions
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:41.800]  absolutely absurd clown level stuff we'll be back in the next segment I'll wrap this up I'll talk about how Ricky Gervais waited into the debate too so we'll be back don't go away
[02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:06.800]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:12.800]  that's it I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:17.800]  it's a time to be praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down
[02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:24.800]  but the reinforcements have arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80
[02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:33.800]  but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:42.800]  we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty
[02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:55.800]  thank you sir for calling
[02:59:12.800 --> 02:59:21.800]  I know God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart and I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support
[02:59:21.800 --> 02:59:31.800]  because I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without you I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun but that's not what's important the enemy could win
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:41.800]  we're a key chess piece in this fight we're being used by God you're being used by God this is Providence so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
[02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:49.800]  info wars the most banned network in the world
[02:59:49.800 --> 03:00:00.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:10.800]  news analysis reports it's the Alex Jones show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:12.800]  we are back
[03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:28.800]  Jessica you need the transgender activists who is basically at the forefront of having 15 female beauticians investigator by the Canadian human rights tribunal refusing to wax her testicles
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:43.800]  through this allegation of a Facebook conversation with a then 14 year old girl who claimed and these messages if true prove it again it's being denied by you need that the messages are true but if they are then it proves obvious child grooming
[03:00:43.800 --> 03:00:59.800]  of course you need was on the show earlier denied all this and will be on the show again I believe in the war room in the next hour but this really got prominent over the past few days because the British comedian Ricky Gervais who is a free speech advocate waited into the debate
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:18.800]  and there's actually a funny tweet which I tweeted earlier which was a daily caller article headlined Ricky Gervais doesn't think women should be forced to wax testicles and then one of the responses below that tweet was from somebody who said the moment that Ricky Gervais became alt right
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:29.800]  that's right because if you don't think women should be forced to wax men's testicles that means you're not see now that's how much the overton window is shifted in clown world
[03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:48.800]  newsbusters reports Ricky Gervais called transphobe for defending women refusing to wax trans woman's penis warning course language throughout again I have to read this ahead of actually saying it British comedian Ricky Gervais has been called transphobic over defending women refusing to wax trans women in Canada
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:02:01.800]  because they're uncomfortable dealing with their clients very male genitalia Gervais defended the spa workers saying that it's quote real feminism for women to choose who to wax or not but internet users aren't having it
[03:02:01.800 --> 03:02:13.800]  on Sunday Gervais weighed in and one of the most most stupidly welk issues to crop up in recent memory in Canada demonstrating himself as a celebrity that isn't completely devoid of common sense
[03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:26.800]  he put out a controversial tweet which said quote how did we get to the point where women are having to fight for the right to choose whether they wax some big old hairy cock and balls or not is it not human rights have your meat and two veg polished
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:40.800]  and of course he was immediately attacked Twitter warriors clamored against Gervais as posting its language like that that has threatened trans people and that it contributes to the larger hashtag war on women
[03:02:40.800 --> 03:03:00.800]  again there are feminists quite radical feminists who are called transphobes who are called terfs who have been excluded from public conversations who have been banned from social media platforms for daring to suggest that men with their testicles hanging out shouldn't be allowed into female locker rooms
[03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:16.800]  one respondent said this was LGBTQ activist Amy Martin quote Ricky Gervais is a transphobic barely disguised as his bigotry is feminism real feminism includes all women including trans women
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:37.800]  so they're literally defending a man who wants to force women to shave his testicles that's feminism in 2019 in clown world Gervais replied surely real feminism also covers a woman's right not to have to wax someone's knob and bollocks if they don't want to
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:56.800]  and it went on from there again we've got these new messages now that post millenials posted which seem to indicate that this is part of a child grooming operation you need denies those messages and as Alex was saying in the last segment could this be one giant troll
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:09.800]  I mean this is obviously coming from the mind of a very sick individual either way but why is this individual going on radio shows that overtly antagonistic to this whole thing has happened earlier
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:29.800]  and you need also went on an Irish radio show going to play that clip after the break but again Lindsay Shepherd free speech activists was banned on Twitter appealed to the ban for basically responding to you need insulting her body shaming her for a very private personal health problem
[03:04:29.800 --> 03:04:49.800]  related to sexual reproduction organs she responded by saying basically well at least I have a uterus banned gone forever no no court of appeal for Twitter of course these are the people who control public discourse this is true clown world will be back this is the Alex Jones show
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:05:07.800]  live don't go away info wars dot com before I started working at info wars I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and in force dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements
[03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:23.800]  and that's DNA force plus now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere support with your DNA so I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity
[03:05:23.800 --> 03:05:38.800]  when you protect your telomere so I started looking into DNA force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[03:05:38.800 --> 03:06:03.800]  but DNA force plus is still there it is the elite supplement I get excited when DNA force plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA force plus at info wars store dot com
[03:06:03.800 --> 03:06:15.800]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[03:06:15.800 --> 03:06:27.800]  I'm going to wrap this up in this segment because we've been talking about this subject literally for the best part of two hours but the trans activist who is demanding that women shave her male genitalia appeared on an Irish radio show
[03:06:27.800 --> 03:06:45.800]  and the host made the point that far from just respecting someone's pronouns we're now being forced to share their increasingly obscure and Iran beliefs this is Jessica you need appearing on an Irish radio show and hanging up when challenged earlier today here's the clip
[03:06:45.800 --> 03:07:03.800]  you if let's say for example I don't want to accept you as a woman and I say listen Jessica I don't believe you're a woman I believe you're a man addresses yeah and I said that you I don't believe that you have the right to tell me to listen to you to believe you
[03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:17.800]  I don't believe like for example I give an example I don't believe in God I do believe in God I'm sorry do you believe in God I do okay I don't believe in God I'm an atheist okay now you believe in God I respect the fact that you believe in God
[03:07:17.800 --> 03:07:31.800]  yeah I respect your point of view and I respect your belief in God and your faith in God that doesn't mean I have to believe in God do you understand the point so some people may not they may respect you and they may respect that you want to be called Jessica
[03:07:31.800 --> 03:07:39.800]  but they may not believe they just don't believe it they said that's fine he wants to be called Jessica that's fine I'll call him Jessica I respect that but I don't believe us and I don't buy into it
[03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:49.800]  so what you're essentially asking these women to do is you're asking them to do a service on you that they don't believe in they don't want to handle a man's genitalia
[03:07:49.800 --> 03:08:05.800]  is that fair yeah not really because you see I'm protected under the BC Human Rights Code because I'm a protected cause that means those women are protected are those women are protected who have a right to say no they don't
[03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:23.800]  because it's because essentially essentially what happens so why why does your rights from there's that's exactly the thing that's why that's why the federal member is coming to a balancing act to see which to see how how right to play out in this whole thing
[03:08:23.800 --> 03:08:37.800]  I mean that's the concern I have I mean look I'm no problem you do what you want to do Jessica and you live your life whatever way you want to live your life but the concern I have is that those women should also be allowed to live their lives the way they want to live their lives
[03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:47.800]  but not but not when they discriminate against the rights of others but they'll argue that they're not discriminating that they're just saying I'm sorry we don't supply a service of a bikini wax or a Brazilian or whatever it happens to be
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:59.800]  or the removal of her from genitalia from a man as far as they're concerned because it's male genitalia and and that's what they're saying they're saying we shouldn't be forced to do that
[03:08:59.800 --> 03:09:07.800]  well have we lost his line there hello either we'll try and get it back in a second we seem to have lost the line have we lost her line she's gone okay
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:17.800]  later on on Twitter Jessica and Eve admitted that she hung up on that radio host who challenged her so she did hang out it wasn't just the line that was lost
[03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:27.800]  the other aspect of this whether it's a troll or not it could be a giant troll it could be an actual anti identity politics troll but it's still disgusting in every way imaginable
[03:09:27.800 --> 03:09:38.800]  but the real world effect or at least the online effect is people are getting banned for challenging this individual including a feminist who was I think banned several months ago for misgendering
[03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:51.800]  Jessica you need and the free speech activist Lindsay Shepherd was also banned a few days ago you need basically made fun of her reproductive abnormality and Lindsay Shepherd responded
[03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:57.800]  by saying something like I forget the exact quote but it was something like well at least I have a uterus
[03:09:57.800 --> 03:10:04.800]  of course in the world of Twitter's Twitter's terms of service where you can actually organize violence against people if you're Antifa that's fine
[03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:16.800]  the Rose City Antifa account that assaulted and you know the journalist still has their account she committed the mortal sin of misgendering Jessica and even her Twitter account is banned forever
[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:27.800]  and Lindsay Shepherd put out a video explaining what happened this is a five minute clip we're going to go to it right now this is Lindsay Shepherd free speech activist on why she was banned by Twitter here it is
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:36.800]  Hi everyone I have been permanently banned from Twitter and yes I did file an appeal but it was quickly denied
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:54.800]  you may have watched the video that I made last night where I talk about the same topic my Twitter ban but I had to take it down and give another shot because I had to make some corrections in order to comply with a publication ban
[03:10:54.800 --> 03:11:11.800]  I was banned from Twitter for responding to a couple of tweets that an individual that I will only refer to you as J.Y. made about me so J.Y. has a very complicated backstory that is getting more and more disjointed
[03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:28.800]  so all I'm going to say here is that J.Y. purports to be a transgender woman and J.Y. is someone that lives in the same province that I do which is why I probably feel a little more invested in this issue than other people who don't live in this province
[03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:45.800]  there are leaked Facebook message screenshots where J.Y. is trying to get advice on how to approach preteen girls in the female washrooms and he says things like can you see tampon strings hanging out of a girl's pussy
[03:11:45.800 --> 03:12:07.800]  what do girls do in the bathroom stall white pussy and change panty liner oh I'm going on the BC fairies next week and lots of 10 year old girls go on field trips on the ferry how can I ask them for a tampon or pad should I teach a 10 year old girl how to use a tampon
[03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:26.800]  yes J.Y. is very obsessed with the menstrual products of 10 to 12 year old girls so J.Y. on Twitter starts tweeting about how I'm dumb and how I have a loose vagina from pushing out a 10 pound baby
[03:12:26.800 --> 03:12:40.800]  but J.Y. has a tight pussy so I tweeted back and basically said if you want to sound like a woman this is not really the way to do it because this is more of a male way of speaking
[03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:50.800]  I said he sounds like a guy who doesn't have a functional romantic relationship with a woman but I guess that describes him pretty well
[03:12:50.800 --> 03:13:06.800]  then J.Y. starts mocking how I have a reproductive abnormality called aseptay uterus and then I reply and I say at least I have a uterus you ugly fat man
[03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:13.800]  I deleted the tweets in the morning when I woke up but was permanently suspended by the afternoon
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:26.800]  some people have said that I should have never engaged with J.Y. online I shouldn't have sunk to his level but the thing is this is someone who straight up ruins people's lives
[03:13:26.800 --> 03:13:32.800]  and I'm not talking about the Twitter bans I'm talking about really ruining people's lives
[03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:47.800]  and the reason I think the J.Y. situation is so important is because it proves trans people are untouchable J.Y. is allowed to make crude and disgusting comments and misogynistic comments
[03:13:47.800 --> 03:14:02.800]  but when I want to talk back to him stand up for myself defend myself I'm silenced and kicked off of the platform permanently but J.Y. receives no punishment and remains on the platform
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:07.800]  the moral of the story is you can't stand up for yourself against a trans person
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:21.800]  one more evidence of this watch the video I made called did I harass a trans person it's I tell the story of a fellow grad student who made a complaint against me at my university
[03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:28.800]  and he was a trans individual who would always try to instigate conflict with me and he made a complaint saying I was the problem
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:39.800]  so when it comes to trans people they are untouchable they are beyond criticism beyond questioning and you are not allowed to stand up for yourself against them
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:54.800]  and sometimes the comment comes up like why are you so focused on trans issues and it's because unfortunately trans activism is one of the major hindrances to free speech and open inquiry in this country
[03:14:54.800 --> 03:15:05.800]  if not the number one hindrance trans activism is responsible for silencing and stifling so many discussions that we need to have in our society
[03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:14.800]  so thank you so much to everyone that is bringing attention to my twitter ban and to the J.Y. situation I've already received so many kind messages
[03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:24.800]  for the next little while I will only be on YouTube until I can find another platform to hit Jon to so please do subscribe if you haven't already

[03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:05.800]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:05.800 --> 03:18:15.800]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:21.800]  That's it. I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.800 --> 03:18:26.800]  It's the time to be praying my friend. I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:33.800]  but the reinforcements have arrived man. I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80

[03:20:41.800 --> 03:20:43.800]  Now we have this headline out of the Daily Caller.
[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:51.800]  These 2020 Democrats have their preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios.
[03:20:51.800 --> 03:20:59.800]  Of course there are no transgender Democrat 2020 presidential candidates so far at least or any who have identified as transgender.
[03:20:59.800 --> 03:21:06.800]  But three prominent Democratic presidential candidates have their preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios.
[03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:12.800]  Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro's bio declares he him L.
[03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:16.800]  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's bio says he him.
[03:21:16.800 --> 03:21:22.800]  That's literally what I did as a joke how Bill de Blasio the mayor of New York City has it.
[03:21:22.800 --> 03:21:27.800]  And Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's bio says she her.
[03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:32.800]  Castro was the first candidate to add his preferred gender pronouns to his Twitter bio on July 1st.
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:36.800]  So this is something that's happened in the last three weeks.
[03:21:36.800 --> 03:21:41.800]  They've started putting their Twitter preferred gender pronouns in their Twitter bios.
[03:21:41.800 --> 03:21:46.800]  My prediction is that all the other candidates or most of them are going to do the same.
[03:21:46.800 --> 03:21:50.800]  Otherwise they're going to be starts we call transphobic.
[03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:53.800]  Can it get any more insane. Absolutely incredible.
[03:21:53.800 --> 03:21:57.800]  Meanwhile this was a headline up at Summit News.
[03:21:57.800 --> 03:22:02.800]  Yesterday AOC claims President Trump is sowing violence.
[03:22:02.800 --> 03:22:04.800]  She came out with a tweet.
[03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:12.800]  It was a Louisiana police officer who said about AOC quote she needs around and I don't mean the kind she used to serve.
[03:22:12.800 --> 03:22:16.800]  Which of course is completely disgusting and that kind of language should not be tolerated.
[03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:19.800]  But of course what did AOC do in response to it.
[03:22:19.800 --> 03:22:23.800]  She fed it into her Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:33.800]  Of course death threats are horrible targeted against anyone but she exploited it by saying this is Trump's goal when he uses targeted language and threatens elected officials who don't agree with this political agenda.
[03:22:33.800 --> 03:22:37.800]  It's authoritarian behavior. The president is sowing violence.
[03:22:37.800 --> 03:22:42.800]  He's creating an environment where people can get hurt and he claims plausible deniability.
[03:22:42.800 --> 03:22:56.800]  Now this of course is within the environment of Democrats repeatedly telling their voters their supporters to go out and harass Trump supporters in restaurants wherever they may be as Maxine Waters said of course.
[03:22:56.800 --> 03:23:11.800]  And in the case of AOC this is pretty rich because the domestic Antifa terrorist who literally tried to massacre ICE agents and fire bomb an ICE facility in Washington State last weekend.
[03:23:11.800 --> 03:23:23.800]  Put out a manifesto in which he specifically used the term concentration camps numerous times which of course was the term applied to border detention centers.
[03:23:23.800 --> 03:23:27.800]  They're not concentration camps. That's completely ludicrous.
[03:23:27.800 --> 03:23:31.800]  Actual Holocaust victims have condemned her for using that language.
[03:23:31.800 --> 03:23:38.800]  And that language was used numerous times by Willem van Spronsen the Antifa terrorist who tried to massacre ICE agents.
[03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:42.800]  You remember the story quickly buried by the mainstream media.
[03:23:42.800 --> 03:23:45.800]  It actually wasn't even played up by quote right wing media.
[03:23:45.800 --> 03:23:48.800]  There were a couple of Fox news stories about it.
[03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:58.800]  It was never really played up as a big story but it was literally a domestic terrorist radicalized by the kind of rhetoric that AOC is responsible for.
[03:23:58.800 --> 03:24:02.800]  Does that mean she's responsible for the attack. No that's not how it works.
[03:24:02.800 --> 03:24:10.800]  But you could at least say that it looks like he's been radicalized by that kind of rhetoric because he wrote in his manifesto quote.
[03:24:10.800 --> 03:24:21.800]  Trump's take action against the forces of evil. Citing in part quote highly profitable detention slash concentration camps and a battle over the semantics.
[03:24:21.800 --> 03:24:31.800]  The case of Cortez has repeatedly referred to immigration detention facilities as concentration camps despite vociferous complaints from actual Holocaust survivors.
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:38.800]  Ryan serve Raider tweeted the case of Cortez claims without evidence that Trump is intentionally trying to get her assassinated.
[03:24:38.800 --> 03:24:47.800]  Last week a domestic terrorist attack tonight facility and used AOC's rhetoric in his manifesto AOC has refused to condemn the terrorist attack.
[03:24:47.800 --> 03:25:00.800]  You remember the video where rebel media reporter confronted both AOC and Ilhan Omar in the halls of Congress asking them will you denounce this anti for attack is very easy to denounce a terrorist attack.
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:06.800]  They refused to do so they said oh we'll put out a statement on it later that statement never came.
[03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:12.800]  So she's accusing Trump of being responsible for this Louisiana police officers death threat.
[03:25:12.800 --> 03:25:19.800]  When a terrorist who tried to massacre ice agents literally used her rhetoric just 10 days prior to that.
[03:25:19.800 --> 03:25:22.800]  I'm talking about violent assault and threats.
[03:25:22.800 --> 03:25:30.800]  Corey Spartacus Booker is now dreaming fantasizing about violently assaulting President Trump.
[03:25:30.800 --> 03:25:38.800]  Headline out of zero hedge Corey Spartacus Booker wants to assault Trump blames testosterone for violent fantasies.
[03:25:38.800 --> 03:25:52.800]  So he appeared on the lake show with Seth Meyers last night and he relayed a story from an Iowa campaign event where dozens of people showed up one of whom told him to quote punch Donald Trump in the face.
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:26:00.800]  Because this is the new face of tolerance is to violently attack anyone who has a different opinion to you because they're all Nazis.
[03:26:00.800 --> 03:26:02.800]  Dude that's a felony man.
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:07.800]  Booker replied before launching into his deep seated desire to assault the president.
[03:26:07.800 --> 03:26:11.800]  He said quote Donald Trump is a guy who you understand he hurts you.
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:20.800]  My testosterone sometimes makes you want to feel like punching him which would be bad for this elderly out of shape man that he is if I did that.
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:28.800]  And then he went on to call Trump a quote physically weak specimen and then he accused Trump of being a body shamer.
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:43.800]  So he's saying it's OK to assault Trump violently because he's a body shamer while at the same time calling Trump out of shape and a physically weak specimen which of course is the epitome of body shaming.
[03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:52.800]  He went on to say quote that's his tactics and you don't beat a bully like him fighting him on his tactics on his terms using his turf he's the body shamer.
[03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:55.800]  Corey Booker said after literally just body shaming Trump.
[03:26:55.800 --> 03:26:58.800]  He's the guy that tries to drag people in the gutter.
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:06.800]  So he's literally fantasizing about violently attacking Trump because he's a body shamer while he's a body shamed Trump.
[03:27:06.800 --> 03:27:20.800]  Zero Hedge asks did Booker's testosterone make him similarly feel like sexually assaulting a girl in high school when he quote slowly reached for her breast only for her to push his hand away once he reached his mark.
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:26.800]  And they provide the newspaper article where that alleged sexual assault is documented.
[03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:43.800]  Goes on to say was Booker's out of control testosterone responsible for a credible allegation. His phrase that he sexually assaulted a man whether or not he identified as a man remains to be seen could have been Jessica you need in a public restroom.
[03:27:43.800 --> 03:27:52.800]  And then they detailed that allegation and did Booker fail to constrain his toxic masculinity when he browbeat former DHS secretary Kirsten Nielsen last January.
[03:27:52.800 --> 03:28:01.800]  Over President Trump's comment that Haiti and parts of Africa are S whole countries sounds like Spartacus needs to get this under control.
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:06.800]  So once again you have the Democrats whining about violent rhetoric all day.
[03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:16.800]  When their supporters are literally in the streets and remind let's not forget that CNN has done glorification pieces about Antifa over and over again.
[03:28:16.800 --> 03:28:23.800]  Their journalists include including Cuomo have repeatedly praised Antifa. They're attacking journalists in the street.
[03:28:23.800 --> 03:28:30.800]  We had an Antifa domestic terrorist tried to blow up an ice facility citing Alexandria case your quarters rhetoric.
[03:28:30.800 --> 03:28:39.800]  But no Donald Trump's bad because he body shames people and he deserves to be violently assaulted in the crazed mind of Corey Booker.
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:44.800]  Absolutely incredible. We'll be back. This is the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars dot com.

[03:32:06.800 --> 03:32:17.800]  The courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[03:32:17.800 --> 03:32:28.800]  Otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[03:32:28.800 --> 03:32:39.800]  The people whose audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[03:32:39.800 --> 03:32:46.800]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts.
[03:32:46.800 --> 03:32:56.800]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening. It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[03:32:56.800 --> 03:33:00.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[03:33:22.800 --> 03:33:40.800]  We are back live. I'm going to get into some more news here in a second player Mark Dice video about Bernie Sanders advocating for the minimum wage campaigning for the $15 minimum wage but not quite seeing it through when it comes to his own campaign staff.
[03:33:40.800 --> 03:33:57.800]  Meantime on encourage everyone to go to info wars store.com where as per usual we have a raft of absolutely mammoth discounts on great products, including 40% off info wars life protein bars 40% off right now.

[03:35:21.800 --> 03:35:33.800]  Headline Bernie Sanders Marks for admitting he will have to cut staff hours to pay them $15 minimum wage, not quite carrying through on the exact policy he's campaigning for.
[03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:55.800]  And Mark dies put out a video today on this very subject here is lectures corporations that they need to start paying their workers at least $15 an hour. And if he becomes president, he's going to raise the national minimum wage to just that corporations like Walmart like the fast food industry
[03:35:55.800 --> 03:36:10.800]  like retail in general and other employer other employees. No reason now why they also should not be paying their employees at least $15 an hour.
[03:36:10.800 --> 03:36:22.800]  But since liberals live by the philosophy of do what they say not what they do. I'm sure you won't be surprised to learn that Bernie Sanders has been paying his campaign staff less than that. And they're not happy about it.
[03:36:22.800 --> 03:36:30.800]  Bernie Sanders campaign workers demand the $15 an hour pay that the candidate has proposed for employees nationwide.
[03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:38.800]  How embarrassing is it got to be for these people to work for a guy who's promising a $15 minimum wage for everybody in America when he's not even paying them that.
[03:36:38.800 --> 03:36:46.800]  So out of embarrassment since this has been making headlines recently, Bernie's decided to give everybody a raise. But in order to pay for it, he's cutting back on their hours.
[03:36:46.800 --> 03:36:56.800]  This is probably the best economic lesson that these staffers are ever going to get in their entire lives. You see, liberals, the pie is only so big. And the more pieces you try to cut out of it, the smaller those pieces are.
[03:36:56.800 --> 03:37:02.800]  The $15 an hour minimum wage is basically the agreed upon talking point by all the Democrat candidates running for president.
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:12.800]  But as you know, the Democrats these days keep trying to one up each other in terms of who could offer more free stuff. So Congresswoman Rashida Taleem is now saying it should be $20 an hour.
[03:37:12.800 --> 03:37:38.800]  That's a great idea, Rashida, especially since the Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that if the minimum wage is raised to just $15 an hour,
[03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:42.800]  that will actually end up costing Americans 1.3 million jobs.
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:48.800]  There's a reason we keep seeing more and more kiosks at fast food restaurants, grocery stores and home improvement stores.
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:52.800]  Because if they're going to have to pay people $15 an hour, they're just going to replace them with a computer.
[03:37:52.800 --> 03:38:00.800]  All the regulars at CNN must be on summer vacation this week because the woman who interviewed Kamala Harris yesterday actually asked her some real questions.
[03:38:00.800 --> 03:38:09.800]  She pointed out the fact that her Medicare for all plan actually won't work unless she dramatically raises taxes on the middle class, which Kamala says she's just not going to do.
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:33.800]  And all of a sudden without a middle class tax hike?
[03:38:33.800 --> 03:38:40.800]  I'm not sure what this woman is doing on CNN because these are the kinds of questions that are asked on her real news network. There must be some mistake here.
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:53.800]  More evidence that everybody at CNN is on summer vacation this week is this woman who also appeared on air to explain that Elizabeth Warren's supposed plan to prevent another economic crisis would in fact cause one.
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:39:04.800]  Now as far as her policy proposals, she is recommending lowering rents, offering affordable childcare, offering free tuition at colleges.
[03:39:04.800 --> 03:39:10.800]  All of that costs money and the American public should be asking, how do you pay for it? One way would be to increase taxes.
[03:39:10.800 --> 03:39:18.800]  Another way is to increase government debt. This is the issue that the American people should be actually focused on.
[03:39:18.800 --> 03:39:30.800]  Because as many experts say, if we don't get control of our debt over the next 10 years, we could be facing a fiscal crisis and that would be extraordinarily harmful to our economy.
[03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:38.800]  At some point in the future, and I don't know when, it could be 10 or 20 years down the road, this country's going to have a huge, huge problem and we probably will go bankrupt.
[03:39:38.800 --> 03:39:45.800]  There's still much debt, the government's still big, there's still many entitlements and someday they're going to probably hyperinflate the dollar into oblivion.
[03:39:45.800 --> 03:39:58.800]  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them
[03:39:58.800 --> 03:40:06.800]  will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the very continent their fathers conquered.
[03:40:06.800 --> 03:40:15.800]  President Trump really is this country's last hope, but he's holding back the dam for bursting, but it's still building pressure and leaking like a sieve and when he's out of office, look out.
[03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:21.800]  Hopefully that won't mean for another six years that we can all stay busy working to restore our republic.
[03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:28.800]  That was Mark Dice talking about Bernie Sanders not following through on his $15 minimum wage promise within his own campaign.
[03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:38.800]  For all his faults though, Bernie Sanders does recognize that you can't have a giant welfare stay and mass migration at the same time, which brings me onto this headline.
[03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:43.800]  Time Magazine calls for migration brainwashing courses in schools.
[03:40:43.800 --> 03:40:46.800]  Now this was an article in Time Magazine.
[03:40:46.800 --> 03:40:51.800]  It was written by a group, a couple of individuals from a group called ISD.
[03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:53.800]  What is ISD?
[03:40:53.800 --> 03:40:56.800]  Well, they work with governments to combat extremism.
[03:40:56.800 --> 03:41:00.800]  Now lo and behold, I looked at their website and looked at who funded ISD.
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:10.800]  This group that is literally pushing for migration brainwashing courses to be introduced in schools to push the idea that it's always positive.
[03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:11.800]  And imagine my shock.
[03:41:11.800 --> 03:41:22.800]  They're funded by the United Nations Development Program, Google, Facebook, the European Commission and Open Society Foundations, which of course is George Soros.
[03:41:22.800 --> 03:41:32.800]  But you can't mention that anyone is funded by Open Society Foundations, even though literally dozens of major NGOs are, because of course that's anti-Semitic.
[03:41:32.800 --> 03:41:41.800]  The article freaks about how popular support for politicians who build their campaigns around anti-migrant and anti-Muslim themes have surged across the western world.
[03:41:41.800 --> 03:41:48.800]  And theories such as the Great Replacement and White Genocide have effectively made their ways into societal and political discourse.
[03:41:48.800 --> 03:41:58.800]  Isn't it amazing how you can only talk about the demographic decline of white voters if you're doing so in a positive context?
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:10.800]  In fact, on the very day this article was published, Axios published another article saying that the Republicans are in big trouble because their white demographic voting base is swiftly disappearing.
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:17.800]  That's okay to talk about the demographic decline of white people so long as you say it's a fantastic thing.
[03:42:17.800 --> 03:42:27.800]  If you dare suggest that there might be any negative consequences, then you're engaging in neo-Nazi rhetoric.
[03:42:27.800 --> 03:42:35.800]  And now they want public brainwashing courses introduced into schools to try and combat anyone who criticizes mass migration.
[03:42:35.800 --> 03:42:47.800]  And by the way, they also included me in a report about the Swedish election complaining about the fact that I influenced the Swedish election because of my videos about the problems caused by mass migration in Sweden.
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:43:06.800]  Absolutely incredible. This is the Alex Jones Show. Infowars.com will be back.
[03:43:18.800 --> 03:43:40.800]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:52.800]  It is the elite supplement. I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive, so you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:44:11.800]  Alex, I got a plug for the Patriot points. I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[03:44:11.800 --> 03:44:23.800]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works a whole lot better. My kids, they use the toothpaste. My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[03:44:23.800 --> 03:44:32.800]  Let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in there. I want a good price, but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[03:44:32.800 --> 03:44:43.800]  I've taken $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off, and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you so much for the plug, but listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:55.800]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that where you have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's okay. Thanks for the support.
[03:44:55.800 --> 03:45:11.800]  The globalists hate free speech and they hate empowering the people. The entire dying dinosaur corporate media, CNN, MSNBC, bombard the public with anti-American, anti-family, anti-God, anti-gun messages. People are sick of it.

[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:19.800]  Coming to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:19.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  We're back and we're going to hit some big final news stories here. Headline up on summit.news. Total anarchy. De Blasio blasted over video showing NYPD cops doused with water. You may or may not have seen this today.
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:51.800]  Similar situation to what happened in London where a total lack of respect for the police which was instituted from the top down led to spiraling crime rates in London. We had a situation once where of course stop and search was heavily restricted because it was called racist.
[03:47:51.800 --> 03:48:07.800]  We had another situation in London where police were told they couldn't chase criminals on mopeds on scooters if they weren't wearing helmets and it basically ended up in just criminals just openly laughing in the face of police officers as they got away with crimes the crime rate spiked.
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:26.800]  New York's crime rate has been going down thanks to their tougher policies but that could be about to change soon and now Mayor Bill De Blasio is facing heat over videos that show NYPD officers getting doused with water with outraged cops blaming De Blasio for being soft on crime.
[03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:37.800]  Now these two incidents happened in Harlem and Brooklyn in one case the cops are actually arresting someone and got doused with water somebody threw a bucket at the head of one of these cops.
[03:48:37.800 --> 03:48:50.800]  In the other clip you show them getting absolutely deluged with water they just walk away calmly they don't even retaliate even though that's literally assaulting a police officer it's a crime they just walk away and do nothing.
[03:48:50.800 --> 03:49:09.800]  Apparently this is because of Mayor Bill De Blasio's softening approach to crime sources within the NYPD said the footage was evidence of wider anarchy taking hold across the city everybody's outraged an NYPD source said is discussing embarrassing there's lawlessness around here now.
[03:49:09.800 --> 03:49:20.800]  Police Chief Terrence Monaghan called the footage reprehensible while another officer blamed the incidents on the NYPD's hands off approach to these guys that De Blasio has encouraged.
[03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:29.800]  He said who does that in the right frame of mind people who believe there are no consequences which is exactly what happened in London.
[03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:44.800]  It's total anarchy this is very sad. Pat Lynch patrolman's been a benevolent association said it would it was anti police rhetoric that led to what you're seeing right now in these videos creating a culture totally lacking in respect.
[03:49:44.800 --> 03:49:51.800]  He said as police officers we need to draw a line in situations like this we need to take action to protect ourselves in the public.
[03:49:51.800 --> 03:50:05.800]  He says the politicians do not care Rudy Giuliani also came out and slam this writing this disrespect for the uniform in New York City is a result of Democrat progressive retrogressive socialist mayor.
[03:50:05.800 --> 03:50:12.800]  This is what happens with knee jerk disrespect for police it will only get worse until these left wing idiots are defeated.
[03:50:12.800 --> 03:50:25.800]  So Rudy Giuliani is calling it out absolutely lawless situation in New York where you can just assault a police officer by throwing a bucket of water at their head and throwing the water over them and basically nothing is done.
[03:50:25.800 --> 03:50:39.800]  Meanwhile, Megan Rappano everybody's favorite US women soccer star who apparently thinks she's Jesus now complain that her national anthem protest was not well received despite her being a non threatening white woman.
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:44.800]  Or could it be because she's an obnoxious insufferable petulant child.
[03:50:44.800 --> 03:50:53.800]  Rappano became one of the first white athletes to kneel during the national anthem and subsequently stated I'll probably never sing the national anthem again.
[03:50:53.800 --> 03:51:03.800]  You'll also recall that she was involved in that incident where they let the American flag drop on the ground during their celebrations widely seen as a big insult.
[03:51:03.800 --> 03:51:15.800]  She told CNN's Van Jones that her anti national anthem protest in which she kneeled in one case and refused to put her hand on her heart in the other refused to sing the national anthem.
[03:51:15.800 --> 03:51:22.800]  She said I actually felt like it was going to be received a little better because she's white and a woman.
[03:51:22.800 --> 03:51:30.800]  She then reeled off a list of vague justifications for protesting against the anthem so she'll justice this so she'll justice that blah blah blah.
[03:51:30.800 --> 03:51:34.800]  And of course she was caught on video in an article that we had a couple of weeks ago.
[03:51:34.800 --> 03:51:43.800]  Ranting I deserve this while holding the World Cup trophy and appears to attempt to make herself a center of attention at every available opportunity.
[03:51:43.800 --> 03:51:48.800]  Again soccer or football as we call it is a team game.
[03:51:48.800 --> 03:51:54.800]  When you win you act humble and you thank the rest of your team members and you console the defeated opposition.
[03:51:54.800 --> 03:52:02.800]  That's the whole idea behind soccer or football as invented in England the gentleman's game.
[03:52:02.800 --> 03:52:09.800]  But now she's took it used it fed into her narcissistic zeal to be the center of attention for everything.
[03:52:09.800 --> 03:52:13.800]  And now she's shocked that people don't like her.
[03:52:13.800 --> 03:52:22.800]  Although many people do of course the resistance love her they actually did a poll which showed that she would be President Trump in a hypothetical election.
[03:52:22.800 --> 03:52:31.800]  Whether that poll is accurate given that all the others before the last election one I would suggest that it's not to on point.
[03:52:31.800 --> 03:52:37.800]  Meanwhile Google polls veterans out over unacceptable keyword Christian.
[03:52:37.800 --> 03:52:45.800]  Google on YouTube denied an answer a veteran's charity because it deemed Christian to be an unacceptable keyword.
[03:52:45.800 --> 03:52:49.800]  Maybe they should have just called them Easter worshipers.
[03:52:49.800 --> 03:52:56.800]  That's the politically correct term for Christians now you can't say Christian anymore it's offensive.
[03:52:56.800 --> 03:53:05.800]  Over in Europe Algerian soccer fans France used to colonize us but today we colonize them last week and the week before that.
[03:53:05.800 --> 03:53:16.800]  Every other night or every three nights in Paris in Lyon and Marseille in these major French cities after the Algerian soccer team won and they did end up winning the Africa Cup of Nations.
[03:53:16.800 --> 03:53:21.800]  They basically went absolutely crazy rioted looted stores.
[03:53:21.800 --> 03:53:26.800]  In one instance they one guy was wielding a chainsaw throwing objects at police.
[03:53:26.800 --> 03:53:28.800]  This is how they celebrate.
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:30.800]  This is their culture.
[03:53:30.800 --> 03:53:31.800]  This is diversity.
[03:53:31.800 --> 03:53:34.800]  This is cultural enrichment.
[03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:40.800]  And one Algeria soccer fan was caught on tape with a message for the French after the Africa Cup of Nations win.
[03:53:40.800 --> 03:53:44.800]  He said quote France used to colonize us but today we colonize them.
[03:53:44.800 --> 03:53:51.800]  Now you always get football fans who go out and riot you've seen it before with basketball fans and things like that.
[03:53:51.800 --> 03:53:54.800]  This seemed overtly political though didn't it.
[03:53:54.800 --> 03:53:59.800]  This is basically Islamists bragging about how they're planning on colonizing France.
[03:53:59.800 --> 03:54:08.800]  There was another instance incident in this article which the video is down below where a couple of French women young women are sat in the car.
[03:54:08.800 --> 03:54:16.800]  They're rocking the car. The women are forced to get out and leave which is probably the best situation that could have arisen out of that.
[03:54:16.800 --> 03:54:21.800]  Given what happened in Cologne Germany New Year's Eve.
[03:54:21.800 --> 03:54:30.800]  The fans reportedly stole the women's bags of money with one justifying the act of criminality by asserting they are women their place is at home.
[03:54:30.800 --> 03:54:38.800]  Other people who feminists want to bring into France and Europe in general on mass for our continued cultural enrichment.
[03:54:38.800 --> 03:54:42.800]  Matteo Salvini doesn't know the Interior Minister of Italy.
[03:54:42.800 --> 03:54:46.800]  He said Paris and Berlin will no longer impose mass migration on Italy.
[03:54:46.800 --> 03:54:48.800]  The story out of voice of Europe.
[03:54:48.800 --> 03:54:52.800]  In a letter sent to French Interior Minister Christophe Castagnet.
[03:54:52.800 --> 03:55:02.800]  Italy's national populist Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini declared that his country will no not bear the brunt of mass migration into Europe.
[03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:11.800]  He said France or Germany cannot decide on migration policies by ignoring the demands of the most exposed countries like us and Malta.
[03:55:11.800 --> 03:55:22.800]  So Salvini again remained steadfast in preventing the cultural enrichment of Italy which was going so well before wasn't it.
[03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:31.800]  What else have we got here we've got Mayor Pete Buttigieg white nationalism the most deadly form of terrorism in the United States.
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:42.800]  He conveniently hasn't included the 9 11 attack the pulse nightclub shooting the San Bernardino shooting the Boston marathon bombing all the shooting at Militia base in Fort Hood, Texas.
[03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:59.800]  Which claimed a total of 2977 American lives conveniently left that out of his equation when he's again trying to tie into this hysteria over white nationalism being the biggest terrorist threat.
[03:55:59.800 --> 03:56:12.800]  Headline on info was journalists triggered over fake news shorts sold by forever 21 corporate journalists are triggered over a $9.90 pair of boxer shorts emblazoned with the phrase fake news sold by forever 21.
[03:56:12.800 --> 03:56:16.800]  They're literally saying that this is inciting violence against journalists.
[03:56:16.800 --> 03:56:21.800]  A local report with the Baltimore Sun publicly blasted forever 21 for selling the shorts.
[03:56:21.800 --> 03:56:28.800]  Yeah, her tweet might actually sell more shorts since she's given the product more publicity than it likely had before.
[03:56:28.800 --> 03:56:34.800]  Maybe an idea for the info was store to get some fake news apparel.
[03:56:34.800 --> 03:56:44.800]  Another local journalist a sports reporter suggested the shorts expressed hatred for journalists so now you can't even create a satirical item of clothing.
[03:56:44.800 --> 03:56:50.800]  Because journalists are going to get triggered by it absolutely incredible.
[03:56:50.800 --> 03:57:04.800]  Meanwhile, Trump calls squad nightmare for America. President Trump on Tuesday insisted he will add Minnesota to his wind column in the 2020 presidential election because voters will side with him against the state's fall left Democratic rep Ilhan Omar.
[03:57:04.800 --> 03:57:10.800]  Of course, Trump nearly won Minnesota in 2016 looked like he was going to win it for a long time.
[03:57:10.800 --> 03:57:28.800]  Now his strategy of making the squad the face of the Democrats is working a tree. Of course, we had CNN come out and quote Democratic insiders who said, as I said last week, Trump had pulled off an absolute masterstroke by keeping the media focus on these four
[03:57:28.800 --> 03:57:37.800]  because their favorability ratings with Democratic swing voters are extremely low in rep Ilhan Omar's case as low as 9%.
[03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:42.800]  It's going to wrap it up for the show. War Room with Owen Shroy is coming up next breaking news at info wars.com.
[03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:51.800]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage together.
[03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:56.800]  We are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of America.
[03:57:56.800 --> 03:58:07.800]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[03:58:07.800 --> 03:58:23.800]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do.
[03:58:23.800 --> 03:58:43.800]  In full wars.com, tomorrow's news today. Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ. Full power! Damn the torpedoes, go straight at him.
[03:58:43.800 --> 03:58:46.800]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:58:46.800 --> 03:58:55.800]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air. I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:58:55.800 --> 03:59:05.800]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:59:05.800 --> 03:59:12.800]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him. It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:12.800 --> 03:59:18.800]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:18.800 --> 03:59:23.800]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:59:23.800 --> 03:59:32.800]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:32.800 --> 03:59:41.800]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:41.800 --> 03:59:43.800]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
