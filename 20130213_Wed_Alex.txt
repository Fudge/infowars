[00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:10.419]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.019]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.741]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:21.842]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.084]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Wednesday, the 13th day of February 2013.
[00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:53.950]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we are going to have open phones as well.
[00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.333]  Again, thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.035]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:03.257]  A lot of these video and audio clips we're going to be playing speak for themselves.
[00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:18.108]  Two hours before, Chris Dorner reportedly got burned up inside of that cabin after killing another sheriff's deputy in Big Bear outside Los Angeles up in the mountains.
[00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:24.332]  And then on top of it, well I guess the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department, on top of it,
[00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:30.257]  You know, also seeing the SWAT team surround it and all the rest of this.
[00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:38.366]  I shot a video two hours before saying that I expect to see it go up in flames.
[00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.968]  We're going to play that clip coming up.
[00:01:39.968 --> 00:01:42.271]  People are like, how on earth did you know this?
[00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:59.643]  Well, the standard procedure when someone held up in a house with a firearm that's already killed police or government gods is to use an armored vehicle or tank to knock down the walls and then set the place on fire.
[00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:00.584]  That's what they did at Waco.
[00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:06.389]  And that's why Waco was so evil because David Koresh could have been picked up in town at any time.
[00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:07.330]  He went into town every day.
[00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.753]  They had an auto repair shop a couple miles away.
[00:02:09.753 --> 00:02:11.394]  He went into town to the grocery store.
[00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:14.077]  He jogged outside the Branch Davidian Ranch.
[00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:17.385]  That they called a compound to dehumanize them.
[00:02:17.385 --> 00:02:20.487]  And they went to have a PR stunt with the ATF to shoot the place up.
[00:02:20.487 --> 00:02:22.468]  The Davidians fought back.
[00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:26.211]  So then they had the military come in and engage in a siege and burn the place down.
[00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:27.932]  Shoot people trying to get out.
[00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:30.153]  And blew up little newborn babies and people.
[00:02:30.153 --> 00:02:33.275]  And then posed with their skulls later.
[00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:34.296]  These were not warriors.
[00:02:34.296 --> 00:02:38.219]  These were psychopathic demons.
[00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:43.943]  And you see the LAPD not even apologizing for shooting up vehicles that didn't even match the description.
[00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:48.919]  You see just the insanity of the government cult.
[00:02:50.287 --> 00:02:51.607]  And it is a government cult.
[00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:58.210]  These people in these corrupt police departments think they're rock stars, and the government bureaucrats above them think they're royalty.
[00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.871]  Anybody who's worked around them has seen it for themselves.
[00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:05.132]  And America is going the same way as any other corrupt empire.
[00:03:05.132 --> 00:03:11.434]  Now, that said, Dorner, I thought from the beginning this was a real story just because it looks like a real story.
[00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:12.334]  It acts like one.
[00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:19.337]  The government's all disjointed and badly coordinated and engaged in PR disasters.
[00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:26.550]  When you see real stage events, the script is written minute one, and it all rolls out.
[00:03:27.802 --> 00:03:34.426]  And they have their targeted liberty that they're trying to take, or the power they're trying to seize.
[00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:40.730]  But it was not a hard prediction, we're gonna play a clip of this here in a moment, that they would burn it down.
[00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.534]  First, there's a clip of San Bernardino sheriffs on the radios talking with the LAPD, who was not in charge officially, but was in charge.
[00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:52.216]  They brought in the SWAT teams and the armored vehicles.
[00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:55.198]  And they're talking about, let's just go ahead and play the clip right now, here it is.
[00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:59.018]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:59.018 --> 00:04:01.862]  The clip we're going to play is cops burn that house down.
[00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:05.045]  But, you know, we're not going to go to it now.
[00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.708]  We're going to have a meeting during the break.
[00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:09.571]  And then we're going to play it after the break.
[00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:11.713]  We're going to do that, OK?
[00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:14.777]  Because I've got a video list right here in my hand.
[00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:17.180]  And when we come back, we're going to go according to this list, OK?
[00:04:20.862 --> 00:04:22.163]  I understand.
[00:04:22.163 --> 00:04:32.232]  So again, we're going to come in, we're going to play the clips that are up at InfoWars.com in our reports on this subject on the other side of this break.
[00:04:32.232 --> 00:04:40.819]  And then we're going to talk about President Obama's State of the Union saying, hey, if you don't do
[00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:45.665]  What I want, Congress, on carbon taxes, I'll just act.
[00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:49.567]  And the same thing on taking over the internet and a lot more.
[00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:55.169]  So we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:55.769]  Please stay with us.

[00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:03.658]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:06:03.658 --> 00:06:08.683]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:06:08.683 --> 00:06:15.891]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:21.637]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:06:21.637 --> 00:06:23.799]  These are items that I did research on.
[00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:25.640]  That I personally use.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.363]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

[00:07:01.017 --> 00:07:08.039]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.660]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:28.875]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:31.196]  Well, Christopher Dorner,
[00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:46.770]  Went out Waco style, and I know the establishment is not happy because there wasn't 28 children, 17 of them under the age of 10, many of them newborn babies or toddlers.
[00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:55.097]  This wasn't a real trophy event where they could pose with the dead children's skulls and their dead bodies to show off what tough guys they are.
[00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:59.501]  Like when you watch Waco, the Rules of Engagement, it shows DOD snipers
[00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:01.035]  I think?
[00:09:24.281 --> 00:09:26.022]  Uh, big fans of what they did.
[00:09:26.022 --> 00:09:30.505]  Shooting up a truck, a different make and model and brand and color.
[00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:33.067]  Uh, Dorner's driving a silver pickup.
[00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:37.649]  Well, if you see a blue pickup doing a paper route with two women, that's obviously Dorner.
[00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:41.892]  Different color women, a woman in the back throwing papers out, open fire.
[00:09:41.892 --> 00:09:43.233]  You know, shoot them up, shoot them both.
[00:09:44.573 --> 00:09:50.638]  You pull a white guy over in a car, tell him go ahead and leave, and then ram him ten seconds later and shoot his vehicle up?
[00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:51.239]  Good!
[00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:51.499]  Good!
[00:09:51.499 --> 00:10:11.056]  In fact, I think they ought to just have gunships fly in, AC-130s with Gatling guns, but also A-10 Warthogs, and just fly up and down the major Los Angeles and Southern California roads, and just open fire like it was the highway of death outside of Kuwait going into Iraq, and just take them out!
[00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.921]  Because that would be like a sacrifice.
[00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:23.132]  That's why government always demands human sacrifice once it gets powerful enough, is that the public needs to be taught, you are the food.
[00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:25.555]  You are the food.
[00:10:25.555 --> 00:10:28.139]  You are here to be eaten for dinner.
[00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:31.822]  And I think it's absolutely wonderful.
[00:10:31.822 --> 00:10:35.644]  And again, I think it's wonderful what happened last night.
[00:10:35.644 --> 00:10:37.745]  That's how I was able to predict two hours before.
[00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:39.785]  I said, I think they're going to burn him down in Waco style.
[00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:46.488]  And we're going to play a clip of that where I predicted it, uploaded it, timestamped to YouTube, timestamped to InfoWars.com.
[00:10:46.488 --> 00:10:53.151]  Because it's standard procedure to go in with a tank and ram it, and then tell the media, cut the feed, just like Waco, and they'll dutifully do it.
[00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:54.752]  And Wolf Blitzer says, this is unprecedented.
[00:10:54.752 --> 00:10:55.772]  No, it's not.
[00:10:55.772 --> 00:10:56.413]  They cut the feed.
[00:10:57.373 --> 00:11:08.260]  I shot a video one minute after and uploaded it called Chris Dorner Torched Waco Style and we break down the fact that
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:15.485]  In fact, that's the video I shot, actually, after I was confirmed, right?
[00:11:15.485 --> 00:11:26.715]  If you actually go to InfoWars.com, there's another article there, and you can go to our YouTube page, and I break it all down, and I'll give you the actual name of that video.
[00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:28.555]  Here in just a moment.
[00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:29.936]  Yes, it's Chris Dorner.
[00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:31.916]  CNN cuts live feed.
[00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:35.257]  Alex Jones predicts they will burn him Waco-style.
[00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:44.200]  That is the actual name of a video that I put out roughly two hours before the torching.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.261]  You see the videos I shot.
[00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:46.681]  Chris Dorner cornered.
[00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:48.842]  CNN cuts live feed.
[00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.242]  I predict they'll torch him.
[00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.883]  Then checkpoints paralyze Big Bear.
[00:11:51.883 --> 00:11:56.284]  And then after it happened, well, while it was starting to burn, Chris Dorner torched Waco-style.
[00:11:56.664 --> 00:12:11.438]  And it was not hard to know the standard default infantry training that SWAT teams, and they are domestic military groups, it's against the law, against the Constitution, Bill of Rights, but it doesn't matter, because a military fights an enemy.
[00:12:11.438 --> 00:12:16.042]  And so that's why the public is now seen as the enemy by more and more of these departments and paramilitary groups.
[00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:22.586]  I understand the need for special teams sometimes, but they're using them for checkpoints on the highways now.
[00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:34.893]  They've got military drills all over the country, and they're now admitting, oh, we are acclimating you, and we're working with the local police department, with role players screaming, I'm not turning my guns in, and saying, you know, I need food.
[00:12:34.893 --> 00:12:41.416]  See, they're preparing for a collapse and a war with the American people in the reorganization of the country.
[00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:44.538]  So I was being a little bit sarcastic there, saying, you know, this is all wonderful.
[00:12:44.538 --> 00:12:45.939]  This is actually horrible.
[00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:48.869]  And see, I don't hate the police out of hand.
[00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:52.332]  They're just brainwashed Americans like everybody else.
[00:12:52.332 --> 00:13:01.378]  And when I see these really corrupt, out-of-control, fear-driven, running off the edge of a cliff from their own shadow, it really freaks me out.
[00:13:01.378 --> 00:13:05.160]  It freaks me out that they're shooting up cars and running checkpoints and beating people up.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:13.966]  And I watched live feeds from helicopters as they had traffic backed up 20 miles up in the mountains by Big Bear, and they would actually aim guns
[00:13:14.967 --> 00:13:22.854]  At families in their cars and go through their cars when they knew Dorner was surrounded and they pinned him in the house.
[00:13:22.854 --> 00:13:27.258]  It was just all a big excuse to power grab.
[00:13:27.258 --> 00:13:34.805]  I mean, I've seen cases now where there'll be a bank robbery and they'll shut down major highways and then just have guns aimed at people as they drive up.
[00:13:35.765 --> 00:13:43.388]  And again, it's this attitude of, we're going to march your kids out of the school in a drill, we're going to put our hands on you with the TSA, we're going to set up warrantless checkpoints.
[00:13:43.388 --> 00:13:47.089]  I mean, this is America becoming North Korea.
[00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:56.073]  And obviously, I am pretty freaked out right now by the fact that they did another Waco-style event, and they didn't know if he had hostages in there.
[00:13:57.113 --> 00:14:02.158]  I mean, if they would have had 17 little children under the age of 10, would they have barbecued them?
[00:14:02.158 --> 00:14:05.041]  And then said that Dorner said it?
[00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:06.643]  Now, here's the deal.
[00:14:06.643 --> 00:14:11.989]  This just shows the lying culture now, out in the open, out in everyone's face.
[00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:17.454]  We're going to play some of the clips, the news clip and the scanner clip here in a moment, zinging into Obama's State of the Union.
[00:14:18.809 --> 00:14:31.645]  But imagine how obvious it is when they say they're asking the media to cut the live feeds as they're surrounding it and have armored wheeled tanks pulling up about to do an infantry maneuver.
[00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:34.881]  Standard military maneuver.
[00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:41.625]  Knock down the walls when you've got infantry inside, and they don't have any tank weapons, and then firebomb it.
[00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:50.572]  I mean, it's 101, or bring a helicopter in, like Randy Weaver with a big bucket of gasoline that they can remote control and drop on top of the house.
[00:14:50.572 --> 00:14:58.017]  But media didn't follow orders and caught it on video, so they backed off, because media was going into the woods and covering it.
[00:14:58.337 --> 00:15:00.158]  Because it's like a big turkey shoot.
[00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:01.378]  Hey, we got women and kids in here.
[00:15:01.378 --> 00:15:03.299]  Let's shoot mama with a baby in her arms.
[00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:05.339]  Let's shoot a little kid in the back.
[00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:08.220]  Because to these guys, because these aren't real men.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.080]  These aren't soldiers.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.401]  These are people that it's like hunting.
[00:15:11.401 --> 00:15:13.902]  These are arrested development wimps.
[00:15:13.902 --> 00:15:25.005]  I've studied their M.O., these types, who just enjoy killing people, but from a distance in a controlled way, like Lon Horiuchi, the sniper, where they feel powerful.
[00:15:26.966 --> 00:15:33.908]  And you see the culture of the drones and all of this, and it totally dehumanizes everyone.
[00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:42.732]  And on the other side of it, you've got the public running around saying, kill the cops, kill more, great job Dorner, Team Dorner.
[00:15:42.732 --> 00:15:43.632]  And all this garbage.
[00:15:43.632 --> 00:15:48.894]  Somebody ought to make an image of Obama in a jersey that has a zero on it and says, Team Dorner.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:16:00.062]  Because he's anti-gun, anti-the-citizens-owning-guns, pro-government, a total statist who was mad that he was thrown out of the cult and was going to show the cult
[00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.611]  To the feds, hey, I'm going to give you trouble in a PR disaster.
[00:16:05.611 --> 00:16:08.012]  I'm going to throw a big giant temper tantrum.
[00:16:08.012 --> 00:16:11.773]  I'm going to go shoot a police captain's daughter.
[00:16:11.773 --> 00:16:13.253]  And people are defending that.
[00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:15.574]  So the police are turning into demons.
[00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.295]  The public's turning into demons.
[00:16:17.295 --> 00:16:23.637]  America accepts torture, abortion, secret arrest, warrantless wiretapping, injustice.
[00:16:23.637 --> 00:16:26.797]  And now all the prosperity is going out the window.
[00:16:26.797 --> 00:16:28.258]  All the liberty is going out the window.
[00:16:29.229 --> 00:16:34.335]  Now our story, we broke this yesterday as it was happening, that clearly they cut the power.
[00:16:34.335 --> 00:16:36.817]  They knew that place, they talked to the owner.
[00:16:36.817 --> 00:16:44.326]  They knew that that house did not, that cabin did not have cable in it.
[00:16:44.326 --> 00:16:47.889]  They knew they could cut the power with the power lines and it turns out they had cut the power.
[00:16:48.675 --> 00:16:49.416]  Okay?
[00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:52.578]  They simply wanted to burn that thing down.
[00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:53.619]  Same thing at Waco.
[00:16:53.619 --> 00:16:57.381]  They told the media, okay, you've been a mile away, get back three miles.
[00:16:57.381 --> 00:17:03.346]  So they had to have telephoto lenses, what German film crew, to even catch the compound burning.
[00:17:03.346 --> 00:17:05.968]  That would have never even been seen until later.
[00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:06.508]  Okay?
[00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:08.430]  The big wooden church with the concrete building inside.
[00:17:09.526 --> 00:17:13.989]  But instead, the FLIR footage got leaked by patriots in the government who didn't like what was happening.
[00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:16.210]  They later killed the former CIA director over the leak.
[00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.371]  He later died in his, quote, kayak.
[00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.152]  Remember that?
[00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:22.134]  But I have the inside sources on where the FLIR came from.
[00:17:22.134 --> 00:17:30.719]  Then it was later confirmed to be the real FLIR and its infantry behind the armored vehicles, going into the building behind it, shooting the people, setting the fires, everything.
[00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:35.382]  And it later came out in Congress, dealt the force, said, quote, we were ordered to go in and pull triggers.
[00:17:37.003 --> 00:17:45.867]  So now we have the new clips from the news with Sam Bernardino on the open scanners saying, burn that mother effer down, burn it down.
[00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:47.207]  We're going to play that clip in a moment.
[00:17:47.207 --> 00:17:52.749]  And then we have the actual scanner of the tank inside planting the firebombs.
[00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:55.030]  Planting the firebombs.
[00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.952]  And they say, okay, we planted them, we planted the burners, now the fire's lit.
[00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:00.652]  Okay, good job.
[00:18:00.652 --> 00:18:04.594]  They're so arrogant now, they cut the feed, burn it down in front of you,
[00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:11.335]  And then tell you they didn't burn it down, and you watch, they're gonna say Dorner burned it down.
[00:18:11.335 --> 00:18:13.216]  Dorner burned it down.
[00:18:13.216 --> 00:18:18.039]  I mean, how many times do SWAT teams shoot their own officers and then frame the person's house they've come in?
[00:18:18.039 --> 00:18:22.181]  It's a culture of, they come first, they're a gang, and you're nobody.
[00:18:22.181 --> 00:18:27.365]  Now, not all departments have succumbed to this, but the big cities mainly have, and it's despicable.
[00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:31.468]  And we know the threat to the public in North Korea is the police.
[00:18:31.468 --> 00:18:33.630]  We know the threat to the public in Mexico is the police.
[00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.571]  Do we want our police to become like that?
[00:18:35.571 --> 00:18:40.095]  Because they are by every historical and sociological benchmark.
[00:18:40.095 --> 00:18:43.117]  Let's go to a clip from KCAL.
[00:18:43.117 --> 00:18:44.558]  Boy, and they glazed over this.
[00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:46.319]  The media is now acting like nothing happened.
[00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:47.359]  That's a whole other story.
[00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:54.082]  Only DrudgeReport.com is carrying our stories and getting it out there, and it's on talk radio everywhere, and the story's getting out.
[00:18:54.082 --> 00:18:59.463]  Because of InfoWars.com, because of DrudgeReport.com, let's go to break with KCAL.
[00:18:59.463 --> 00:19:00.604]  Here it is.
[00:19:00.604 --> 00:19:02.324]  We hear back from our Carter Evans.
[00:19:02.324 --> 00:19:08.946]  It sounds like police officials were trying to move Carter out of the area into a safer area.
[00:19:08.946 --> 00:19:13.588]  We do know that authorities were searching for a man in a Dodge pickup truck.
[00:19:16.565 --> 00:19:18.366]  All right, that's enough.
[00:19:40.407 --> 00:19:42.648]  Go to DrudgeReport.com on the left hand side, there's all the links.
[00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:45.789]  They're also at InfoWars.com, obviously it's an InfoWars story.
[00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:53.093]  Now we have the even more powerful scanner of inside the tank to the command post down the hill as they plant the firebombs.
[00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:54.333]  Now here's the deal.
[00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:58.475]  You're going to be called a conspiracy theorist, even though they admit this is their real transmissions.
[00:19:58.475 --> 00:20:00.316]  You got cops running around foaming at the mouth.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.661]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.661 --> 00:20:13.348]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:20:13.348 --> 00:20:17.811]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:20:17.811 --> 00:20:20.553]  But we can't do that without your help.

[00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:41.446]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:20:41.446 --> 00:20:51.332]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:20:51.332 --> 00:20:52.833]  The war is here.
[00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:54.734]  It's an info war.
[00:20:54.734 --> 00:20:56.495]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:21:01.278 --> 00:21:03.519]  Is your immune system under siege?
[00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:07.001]  Allergies and crippling immune diseases are on the rise.
[00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:12.063]  Vaccines, radiation, and GMOs lead the charge against your health.
[00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:16.605]  Fortunately, health-conscious consumers are enlisting the help of RNA drops.

[00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:10.858]  The colon needs proper alignment for faster, more effective elimination.

[00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:37.337]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:37.337 --> 00:22:43.080]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.643]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:04.744]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:04.744 --> 00:24:14.806]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.806 --> 00:24:21.028]  Alright, if you just joined us, I'm going to be breaking down Obama's incredibly chilling State of the Union and what's really happening with the economy.
[00:24:22.403 --> 00:24:30.807]  When he said, hey, if Congress doesn't act on carbon taxes, which will totally shut us down, which they're doing on purpose, he said, I'll do it on my own.
[00:24:30.807 --> 00:24:34.169]  So Congress has got to start the impeachment process right now.
[00:24:34.169 --> 00:24:36.370]  The problem is most of the leadership's bought and paid for.
[00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.991]  This country is in deep, deep trouble.
[00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:40.332]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:44.874]  We're going to open the phones up for your take on the Waco-style barbecuing of Dorner.
[00:24:44.874 --> 00:24:48.276]  Of course, they say they found his body in the building.
[00:24:48.276 --> 00:24:50.777]  But people are saying, Alex, how did you call this?
[00:24:51.437 --> 00:24:58.119]  That, you know, they've cut the feed, and it's probably so they can burn him out, Waco style.
[00:24:58.119 --> 00:25:01.879]  That's, it's like, how did I predict the sun would come up this morning?
[00:25:01.879 --> 00:25:03.620]  See, that's what's so frustrating.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.121]  When you're awake, you can call stuff about 90% of the time.
[00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:07.941]  No exaggeration.
[00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:09.161]  In fact, more than that.
[00:25:09.161 --> 00:25:11.502]  I just don't want to sound arrogant.
[00:25:11.502 --> 00:25:12.422]  It's not arrogance.
[00:25:12.422 --> 00:25:16.523]  This is, there's the real world, and then there's what we're taught all day.
[00:25:17.512 --> 00:25:19.793]  And there is almost no mainstream media.
[00:25:19.793 --> 00:25:23.213]  There's a few LA articles going, did the SWAT team set it?
[00:25:23.213 --> 00:25:26.734]  What does this audio mean?
[00:25:26.734 --> 00:25:41.458]  It's kind of like when the UN officials a few weeks ago, the UN-funded, controlled, mandated, communist Chinese, put the baby behind the car, the 13-month-old baby that the parents had hid, their second child, and they run over it with a car.
[00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:43.178]  And then the ABC News headline was,
[00:25:46.385 --> 00:25:52.649]  Baby run over in China by car with population control officials in it.
[00:25:52.649 --> 00:25:54.631]  Like, not population control.
[00:25:56.004 --> 00:25:57.645]  Tyrants run over baby.
[00:25:57.645 --> 00:26:02.889]  It's like, well, a car ran over a baby and happened to have some population control officials in it.
[00:26:02.889 --> 00:26:04.390]  This is how they spin everything.
[00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:13.816]  So now we have the matrix being more and more obvious here of propaganda, where they cut the feeds on the helicopters.
[00:26:13.816 --> 00:26:18.520]  I've got reports where they, quote, ordered the local news, but some of the local news didn't follow orders.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.602]  You say, oh, we better get rid of that First Amendment.
[00:26:22.302 --> 00:26:24.004]  And still carried the audio.
[00:26:24.004 --> 00:26:29.969]  And the local news, and I've got the reports right here, said, hey, it's audio of the scanners.
[00:26:29.969 --> 00:26:31.350]  How do we know he doesn't have a scanner?
[00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.291]  No, we're going to run this.
[00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:35.954]  And see, they've scrambled most of the scanners.
[00:26:35.954 --> 00:26:39.036]  In the last few years, it's gone to this federal system, and they've unified the codes.
[00:26:39.036 --> 00:26:48.104]  But still, there's a lot of cops out there who are kind of having a, you know, a big pity party, hysteria party, who are so uncontrolled, you know, they're shooting up cars the wrong color.
[00:26:48.484 --> 00:26:49.125]  Do you imagine?
[00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:51.227]  Oh, there's a white guy in a silver car.
[00:26:51.227 --> 00:26:52.408]  Let's shoot that up.
[00:26:52.408 --> 00:26:55.031]  There's some women throwing newspapers out of a blue truck.
[00:26:55.031 --> 00:26:56.513]  Looks nothing like Dorner's truck.
[00:26:56.513 --> 00:26:57.053]  It's silver.
[00:26:57.053 --> 00:26:58.134]  Let's just shoot them up.
[00:26:58.134 --> 00:27:02.099]  I mean, that's Yosemite Sam level.
[00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:04.441]  Just running around.
[00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:12.822]  And this is the government that's got the helicopters, the checkpoints, the guns, the weapons, the surveillance.
[00:27:12.822 --> 00:27:19.206]  It's why the founders said, keep that government small, keep it under control, because government's like fire.
[00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:22.187]  It is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:27:22.187 --> 00:27:25.629]  And that's the terrorist, of course, George Washington, that FEMA demonizes all day.
[00:27:25.629 --> 00:27:29.971]  And I know police, I've heard them all over talk radio and in the news all over the country.
[00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:32.993]  They're marveling at how unprofessional the LAPD is.
[00:27:32.993 --> 00:27:34.173]  But it's beyond that.
[00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:35.554]  It's a bunch of crazy people.
[00:27:37.196 --> 00:27:45.743]  I'm not saying they're all crazy, but, I mean, just bad leadership, unaccountable, and then they talk on the scanners.
[00:27:45.743 --> 00:27:47.264]  Okay, you've broken through.
[00:27:47.264 --> 00:27:49.546]  Put the burners down and burn them up like we planned.
[00:27:49.546 --> 00:27:50.847]  Okay, the burners are ignited.
[00:27:50.847 --> 00:27:51.707]  The house is on fire.
[00:27:51.707 --> 00:27:53.609]  I mean, open and shut.
[00:27:53.609 --> 00:27:57.332]  And you've got the cops outside running around screaming in front of the news.
[00:27:57.332 --> 00:27:58.473]  Burn him!
[00:27:58.473 --> 00:28:00.314]  Kill him!
[00:28:00.314 --> 00:28:02.356]  Just like totally turned over to rage.
[00:28:03.942 --> 00:28:05.063]  Because it's a cult.
[00:28:05.063 --> 00:28:07.905]  It's like crying for Kim Jong-il when he died.
[00:28:07.905 --> 00:28:10.007]  All the fake days of crying.
[00:28:10.007 --> 00:28:15.251]  The more they show off and cry for the dead officer they just killed, he just reportedly shot.
[00:28:15.251 --> 00:28:15.811]  And I get it.
[00:28:15.811 --> 00:28:16.812]  You know, guy died.
[00:28:16.812 --> 00:28:18.553]  It's what you signed on for.
[00:28:18.553 --> 00:28:19.454]  I'm sad you're dead.
[00:28:19.454 --> 00:28:20.795]  Get a great pension for your family.
[00:28:20.795 --> 00:28:22.476]  You know, have a nice parade.
[00:28:22.476 --> 00:28:24.378]  You signed on to be a tough guy, okay?
[00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:27.582]  You signed on to do this.
[00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:29.103]  Quite frankly, sounds pretty exciting to me.
[00:28:29.103 --> 00:28:34.227]  I mean, you signed on for all this, and people are going to die.
[00:28:34.227 --> 00:28:35.768]  I mean, that's what you signed on for.
[00:28:35.768 --> 00:28:39.150]  And I'm sad the cop's dead, but what about the citizens that are getting shot up?
[00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.873]  And so the police are freaking out, screaming, burn that mother effer!
[00:28:43.873 --> 00:28:47.295]  You know, we played the clip earlier, we'll play it again.
[00:28:47.295 --> 00:28:54.059]  But when we come back from break, I'm going to play the raw scanner, which they admit is theirs, and I don't know how they're going to spin this.
[00:28:54.059 --> 00:28:54.420]  This is
[00:28:55.424 --> 00:29:00.847]  From KCAL, from the big LA station down the hill.
[00:29:00.847 --> 00:29:05.789]  This is all police scanner audio directly off the news channels.
[00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:10.771]  And it's the armored tank, the wheeled tank, knocking down three of the walls.
[00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:12.312]  One wall's left standing.
[00:29:12.312 --> 00:29:13.353]  They hear a gunshot.
[00:29:13.353 --> 00:29:16.354]  He probably killed himself, Dorner.
[00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:19.536]  And then they set the place on fire.
[00:29:19.536 --> 00:29:20.496]  And burned the place up.
[00:29:20.496 --> 00:29:23.738]  And people need to understand, this is the default position.
[00:29:24.474 --> 00:29:26.015]  Okay, they do this all the time.
[00:29:26.015 --> 00:29:30.057]  There have been many cases of them burning out patriots and people.
[00:29:30.057 --> 00:29:36.180]  I mean, if they know you're a veteran or they know you know how to use a gun, they're not gonna go in to capture you and take you to trial.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.222]  And some could argue, well, he's already killed a bunch of people, you know, burn him out.
[00:29:39.222 --> 00:29:43.744]  The point is, don't cut the feed, burn it out, then say you didn't do it, okay?
[00:29:43.744 --> 00:29:45.826]  Stop treating us like we're stupid.
[00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.147]  Stop being filled with hypocrisy.
[00:29:48.147 --> 00:29:48.767]  We'll be back.
[00:29:48.767 --> 00:29:50.488]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:51.869]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.869 --> 00:29:53.370]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.404 --> 00:29:57.048]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.277 --> 00:30:01.877]  Here it is!
[00:30:01.877 --> 00:30:06.099]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:07.380]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.941]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:10.941 --> 00:30:13.543]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:13.543 --> 00:30:19.405]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:19.405 --> 00:30:25.648]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:26.068 --> 00:30:32.030]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:36.212]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:36.212 --> 00:30:40.513]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:40.513 --> 00:30:46.456]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:46.456 --> 00:30:50.017]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:51.978]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:51.978 --> 00:30:52.418]  It's here.

[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.642]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:34.642 --> 00:33:35.502]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:35.502 --> 00:33:38.203]  Central Standard Time, we are here live.
[00:33:38.203 --> 00:33:51.810]  I want to give the number out specifically on the State of the Union A and B. I want to give the number out on the Christopher Dorner funeral pyre going out like the children did at Waco.
[00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.832]  Because again, I'm not crying tears over this guy getting killed.
[00:33:55.832 --> 00:33:56.933]  Because all the M.O.
[00:33:56.933 --> 00:34:03.655]  looks like this was a real story, a real event from the paramilitary police force that we've created in this country.
[00:34:03.655 --> 00:34:05.556]  It's going to bite itself in the butt.
[00:34:05.556 --> 00:34:07.097]  Militaries have always killed each other.
[00:34:07.097 --> 00:34:08.477]  There's always been friendly fire.
[00:34:08.477 --> 00:34:10.218]  There's always been fragging.
[00:34:10.218 --> 00:34:12.999]  This stuff goes on.
[00:34:12.999 --> 00:34:18.381]  Especially as a lot of people get into these positions to go out and be able to kill people.
[00:34:18.381 --> 00:34:23.263]  I mean, they're getting into it to go out and kill people, where they can legally and lawfully kill people as psychopaths.
[00:34:24.336 --> 00:34:28.098]  I'd say 20% of cops are that type of person now.
[00:34:28.098 --> 00:34:30.259]  And they've absolutely got to be removed.
[00:34:30.259 --> 00:34:32.520]  But instead, they're being put in positions of power.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.521]  But I want to get your take on Obama's State of the Union that I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:34:35.521 --> 00:34:36.902]  I'll play some clips in a moment.
[00:34:36.902 --> 00:34:39.463]  And I want to get your take on what you saw yesterday.
[00:34:39.463 --> 00:34:41.604]  But we've got a couple clips we're going to play now.
[00:34:41.604 --> 00:34:42.765]  Let's just get to
[00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:48.761]  The KCAL clip we've already played, then I'll get to the other clips I haven't played yet.
[00:34:48.761 --> 00:35:04.089]  This is a 51 second clip on the local TV station where they've got feeds from the ground with police running around screaming, burn that house down, bleep, burn that mother bleep down.
[00:35:04.089 --> 00:35:09.272]  And then we have the audio inside the tank back to the command post on the scanner.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.961]  On an open radio channel.
[00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:13.142]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:35:13.142 --> 00:35:14.983]  They're going to do something illegal.
[00:35:14.983 --> 00:35:22.469]  They're going to purposely burn this guy up so they don't have to get killed taking him, you know, going in and taking him out, or trying to get him to surrender.
[00:35:22.469 --> 00:35:24.750]  They just want to get this over with.
[00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:28.433]  Okay, clearly he was never going to surrender, so I can see the psychology of that.
[00:35:28.433 --> 00:35:37.920]  But... Still, the media is compliantly turning off the feed so we couldn't see what really happened as the tank knocked down the walls.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.665]  And conveniently now they're saying, oh never mind what you heard, just go to sleep.
[00:35:43.665 --> 00:35:46.168]  And it's the same on every other big issue.
[00:35:46.168 --> 00:35:51.835]  Or I see on the news, we're going to blow up Building 7 for the other building's safety.
[00:35:51.835 --> 00:35:54.598]  Saw it on the news, heard it on the radio, have the clips.
[00:35:55.239 --> 00:35:56.860]  Cops saying, get back, we're blowing it up.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.720]  And I go, hey, they said they blew that up.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.421]  Oh, shut up, you think the government did it?
[00:36:00.421 --> 00:36:01.521]  What, do you work for Bin Laden?
[00:36:01.521 --> 00:36:07.043]  I'm like, no, criminal elements run Al-Qaeda, and they're going to use Al-Qaeda to attack us and take our liberty.
[00:36:07.043 --> 00:36:08.304]  Why'd they blow up Building 7?
[00:36:08.304 --> 00:36:09.884]  This needs to be investigated.
[00:36:09.884 --> 00:36:10.865]  It didn't exist.
[00:36:10.865 --> 00:36:12.645]  I'm like, well, I have the video clips.
[00:36:12.645 --> 00:36:14.426]  Never mind those children.
[00:36:14.426 --> 00:36:14.886]  Never mind.
[00:36:14.886 --> 00:36:16.007]  And it's the same thing now.
[00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:16.627]  Never mind.
[00:36:17.387 --> 00:36:25.883]  Never mind, never mind that you saw them cut the feed and then you have multiple audio clips of the police saying we're going to burn him up and I'm going to get to those right now.
[00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.646]  Just forget you ever saw that.
[00:36:28.931 --> 00:36:33.435]  And forget the Dime Corps has been caught running kidnapped children on record and the UN has over and over again.
[00:36:33.435 --> 00:36:36.497]  And you know, forget the government's been caught shipping narcotics in over and over again.
[00:36:36.497 --> 00:36:39.179]  And forget the NSA's warrantlessly wiretapping you.
[00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:42.502]  And forget that they're setting up warrantless checkpoints now searching your vehicles.
[00:36:42.502 --> 00:36:48.587]  And forget the fact they're introducing legislation to physically confiscate your guns in multiple states and at the federal level.
[00:36:48.587 --> 00:36:49.628]  Just forget it!
[00:36:49.628 --> 00:36:56.394]  Forget the fact they're shutting down our power plants and raising our taxes to bankrupt us, to bring us into government receivership.
[00:36:56.974 --> 00:36:57.815]  Forget all that.
[00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.175]  Forget Agenda 21.
[00:36:59.175 --> 00:36:59.976]  Everything's fine.
[00:36:59.976 --> 00:37:01.076]  The government loves us.
[00:37:01.076 --> 00:37:02.557]  They never lie to us.
[00:37:02.557 --> 00:37:14.443]  It is this attitude that allows them to cut a feed, torch a building, say they're going to torch it, and then there's no discussion about, you just illegally killed somebody.
[00:37:14.443 --> 00:37:19.245]  And we're all supposed to just play along with the lie.
[00:37:19.245 --> 00:37:21.527]  Now let's go to that clip we've already played and then to the new clips.
[00:37:21.527 --> 00:37:23.988]  KCAL, here it is.
[00:37:23.988 --> 00:37:25.869]  We hear back from our Carter Evans.
[00:37:27.515 --> 00:37:32.356]  It sounds like police officials were trying to move Carter out of the area into a safer area.
[00:37:32.356 --> 00:37:36.998]  We do know that authorities were searching for a man in a Dodge pickup truck.
[00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:09.511]  Okay, so that's when the gunfight was going on.
[00:38:09.511 --> 00:38:14.732]  You see fire, you see smoke, not just from firearms.
[00:38:14.732 --> 00:38:19.273]  That went out live and that was taped live off television and the media is trying to cover that up.
[00:38:19.273 --> 00:38:21.233]  They were clearly trying to set the place on fire then.
[00:38:22.722 --> 00:38:27.485]  Okay, and then they wanted to be the heroes and set it on fire and burn him out, but they got driven back.
[00:38:27.485 --> 00:38:29.506]  A couple of them got shot.
[00:38:29.506 --> 00:38:33.888]  And remember, he's down the hill earlier with a kidnapped couple, and he'd been there for days.
[00:38:33.888 --> 00:38:36.109]  How do they know there weren't people inside the building?
[00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:37.390]  Now, let's go to the next clip.
[00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.472]  This is from the armored vehicle, the wheeled tank, that's rammed down three of the walls.
[00:38:42.472 --> 00:38:50.877]  It's about to ram down the fourth wall, and they are going to then, quote, place the burners
[00:38:52.324 --> 00:38:55.106]  The burners.
[00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:56.047]  Wonder what that means.
[00:38:56.047 --> 00:39:04.134]  And then, in case they can spin that, oh, well, we don't mean we pull Building 7, or we don't mean, you know, burners mean burners.
[00:39:04.134 --> 00:39:05.555]  They go, okay, burners ignited.
[00:39:05.555 --> 00:39:07.677]  Okay, the fire is set.
[00:39:09.164 --> 00:39:13.827]  Sounds like pretty clear English to me, like the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:39:13.827 --> 00:39:15.529]  Alright, I'm placing the burners.
[00:39:15.529 --> 00:39:17.290]  Alright, the burners are ignited.
[00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.651]  Okay, the fire is going.
[00:39:18.651 --> 00:39:22.674]  I mean, it's like, hey honey, will you set a fire in the barbecue pit so I can cook some stuff?
[00:39:22.674 --> 00:39:25.576]  Yeah, honey, I'm putting the coals in right now.
[00:39:25.576 --> 00:39:26.576]  Okay, I've ignited it.
[00:39:26.576 --> 00:39:29.178]  The fire is lit.
[00:39:29.178 --> 00:39:30.699]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip right now.
[00:39:30.699 --> 00:39:32.220]  Here it is.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.882]  Alright, Steve, we're going to go forward with the plan with the burner.
[00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:40.173]  Copy.
[00:39:40.173 --> 00:39:43.155]  We want it, uh, like we talked about.
[00:39:43.155 --> 00:39:46.658]  7 burners deployed and we have a fire.
[00:39:46.658 --> 00:39:50.620]  Copy, 7 burners deployed and we have a fire.
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.321]  Guys, be ready on the number 4 side.
[00:39:52.321 --> 00:39:53.542]  We have fire in the front.
[00:39:53.542 --> 00:39:56.084]  It might come out the back.
[00:39:56.084 --> 00:40:00.687]  Woman on the 4 side, remember your backdrops.
[00:40:00.687 --> 00:40:00.727]  62, 10-1.
[00:40:05.524 --> 00:40:06.685]  We're good to go.
[00:40:06.685 --> 00:40:07.846]  We're good to go.
[00:40:07.846 --> 00:40:08.446]  We're good to go.
[00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:39.390]  10-4, we're just bringing fire in about 200 yards out.
[00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.111]  Your call.
[00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:42.111]  Copy.
[00:40:42.111 --> 00:40:44.432]  Frank, 61 Lincoln, 61 Charlie.
[00:40:44.432 --> 00:40:47.213]  You ready for fire?
[00:40:47.213 --> 00:40:48.433]  61 Charlie, 61 Lincoln, Ma'am.
[00:40:48.433 --> 00:40:49.954]  Negative.
[00:40:49.954 --> 00:40:53.475]  I still don't have adequate penetration on the 2-3 or the 3-4.
[00:40:53.475 --> 00:40:57.256]  Hang on, I still have live ammo popping.
[00:40:57.256 --> 00:40:57.857]  Okay.
[00:40:57.857 --> 00:41:01.618]  I'm only going to copy your 3-4, Small Angle.
[00:41:06.178 --> 00:41:14.641]  Alright, they wanted to get to that basement and burn him out.
[00:41:14.641 --> 00:41:16.222]  That was the main goal.
[00:41:16.222 --> 00:41:19.823]  That was the main push that they were going for.
[00:41:34.932 --> 00:41:43.199]  Now, we've got the police running around saying burn it, burn up the house, clearly trying to burn it up during the first firefight, launching something at it.
[00:41:43.199 --> 00:41:49.524]  Whether it was the flammable type of tear gas rounds that are somewhat good at starting fires.
[00:41:49.524 --> 00:41:50.905]  If you listen later, we don't know what happened.
[00:41:50.905 --> 00:41:52.347]  It almost sounds like they have flamethrowers.
[00:41:52.987 --> 00:41:59.289]  I know a lot of the military terminology, at least when I read about World War II, was they would call flamethrowers burners.
[00:41:59.289 --> 00:42:01.809]  They would go in and flamethrow people hiding in holes.
[00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:03.430]  They'd go, bring in burners!
[00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.990]  I mean, I've heard the radio transmissions, seen the documentaries.
[00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:11.852]  They'd go, if you look this up in the terminology, they'd say, you know, we're 500 yards out with a burner.
[00:42:11.852 --> 00:42:13.512]  I mean, that's military terminology.
[00:42:13.512 --> 00:42:19.094]  I don't know if it's changed since Korea and Vietnam and World War II, but I mean, it might have been a flamethrower for all we know.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:21.561]  I mean, the LAPD's got everything in the world.
[00:42:21.561 --> 00:42:26.784]  And by the way, San Bernardino County and Big Bear, they were, quote, in charge.
[00:42:26.784 --> 00:42:36.529]  The sheriff was in charge, but it was the LAPD that was choppered in with the equipment, their vehicles brought in, you know, trucked in on 18-wheelers.
[00:42:36.529 --> 00:42:37.870]  They were running the show.
[00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:41.432]  Sure, the sheriff was in charge, but he was like, okay, you're the quarterback.
[00:42:41.432 --> 00:42:41.872]  Go in there.
[00:42:43.137 --> 00:42:47.862]  I almost want to open the phones up for police and get their take on this, but we'll do that after the first round of calls.
[00:42:47.862 --> 00:42:48.203]  800-259-9231.
[00:42:48.203 --> 00:42:48.423]  800-259-9231.
[00:42:48.423 --> 00:42:51.567]  And we'll get your take on the Dorner situation and the State of the Union.
[00:42:51.567 --> 00:42:52.528]  That's the topic.
[00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:55.911]  I don't screen your calls, but when I say, hey, I want to hear from you on this,
[00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:05.465]  That's what we're talking about, so that's what I want to hear from you on.
[00:43:05.465 --> 00:43:08.026]  I really want to hear what you have to say on those subjects.
[00:43:08.026 --> 00:43:13.268]  800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:43:13.268 --> 00:43:25.012]  We have a guest popping in on the hurricane and the aftermath of that a few months ago, and then now this new winter storm, and just how government isn't responding and is actually raising property taxes on people and stuff.
[00:43:25.012 --> 00:43:28.113]  We've got a guest joining us for about 15 minutes at the bottom of the next hour, but that's it.
[00:43:28.113 --> 00:43:29.214]  The rest of the show is going to be news.
[00:43:29.714 --> 00:43:31.476]  Uh, and open phones today.
[00:43:31.476 --> 00:43:39.603]  We've got a lot of other key clips we're going to play from the whole State of the Union last night, but for me this illustrates the absurdity of all of this.
[00:43:39.603 --> 00:43:47.271]  Now you can go see it time stamped at YouTube, time stamped at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, about two hours before.
[00:43:48.513 --> 00:43:52.014]  They torched it as they were getting the armored vehicles off the 18-wheelers.
[00:43:52.014 --> 00:43:53.715]  I saw that.
[00:43:53.715 --> 00:43:55.275]  They said, oh, the police have asked.
[00:43:55.275 --> 00:43:57.456]  It's unprecedented for them to cut the feed.
[00:43:57.456 --> 00:43:59.337]  We've got a clip of that coming up with Wolf Blitzer.
[00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:00.737]  And the other channels did it.
[00:44:00.737 --> 00:44:03.058]  Then they started demanding that the scanners be cut.
[00:44:03.058 --> 00:44:05.579]  They're like, well, you can't see that.
[00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:06.840]  He may have a scanner.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.820]  And most news did.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.061]  A few did, and that's how we had those clips you just heard.
[00:44:11.533 --> 00:44:13.054]  I mean, I guess they just think they're God now.
[00:44:13.054 --> 00:44:15.835]  They order the media to stand down so they can do whatever.
[00:44:15.835 --> 00:44:19.638]  And again, this guy, you can say he was bad if he was guilty, and a lot of evidence points that direction.
[00:44:19.638 --> 00:44:23.300]  But do you want to be surrounded and have your house burned down and they just say you were a child killer?
[00:44:24.761 --> 00:44:37.831]  Corrupt governments will frame people, and our government's been caught framing people, and major crime labs, the LAPD crime lab, the Houston crime lab, the FBI crime lab, the San Francisco crime lab, the Dallas crime lab, almost every crime lab.
[00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:46.557]  If you look up the name of your major city, crime lab scandal, you'll see people being framed.
[00:44:46.557 --> 00:44:53.562]  I mean, I was exposing police stealing drugs where I grew up in Rockwall, Texas, and they called me in the office and said, we're gonna say you stole
[00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.273]  Stereo equipment out of some trailer park.
[00:44:57.273 --> 00:45:02.659]  And I said, I've never sold anything but beer out of people's golf carts.
[00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:05.103]  And the cop's like, look, I know that.
[00:45:05.103 --> 00:45:06.504]  You're going to be raped and given AIDS.
[00:45:07.813 --> 00:45:11.115]  And he said some other things, racist stuff.
[00:45:11.115 --> 00:45:15.257]  And then he slammed my head down on the thing and said, you know, basically, you're dead if you don't shut up.
[00:45:15.257 --> 00:45:17.699]  And then my dad got the word they were going to kill me if we didn't move.
[00:45:17.699 --> 00:45:20.681]  We moved to Austin, Texas because of this.
[00:45:20.681 --> 00:45:24.823]  I have experienced a cop sitting there going, we know you stole that stereo equipment.
[00:45:24.823 --> 00:45:28.205]  We're going to get you for that if you don't shut up about the other trouble you've been causing.
[00:45:28.205 --> 00:45:30.967]  And you're like, I don't steal anything in years.
[00:45:30.967 --> 00:45:32.788]  I think I've stolen beer out of people's golf carts.
[00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:34.676]  Stand up.
[00:45:34.676 --> 00:45:35.996]  Stand up right here for me.
[00:45:35.996 --> 00:45:37.097]  Slam my head in the thing.
[00:45:37.097 --> 00:45:40.619]  Listen, you little... You know, the whole thing was spit dripping out of his mouth.
[00:45:40.619 --> 00:45:42.100]  So I have experienced it.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:53.267]  And I was just like, stop pulling us over and trying to search us for drugs when we're a bunch of, you know, crap-kicking jock, you know, cowboy hat-wearing beer drinkers.
[00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:57.410]  Stop saying we're doing drugs when you're the one selling them.
[00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:58.431]  I'm already digressing.
[00:45:58.431 --> 00:46:01.713]  I just... The public is so naive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:02.796 --> 00:46:06.019]  The public is so absolutely naive.
[00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:11.163]  They have no idea, no idea what's really going on in this country.
[00:46:11.163 --> 00:46:14.987]  And that's why we're being absolutely robbed.
[00:46:14.987 --> 00:46:18.590]  And now, some people are awake, but their answer is just kill all the police.
[00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:19.851]  We've seen that all over the news.
[00:46:19.851 --> 00:46:22.253]  Like, the news is like, well, I guess Dorner did have a point.
[00:46:22.253 --> 00:46:23.814]  Perhaps he is good.
[00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:26.317]  And yeah, you know, go Dorner, kill more cops.
[00:46:26.317 --> 00:46:27.638]  Yeah, let's just randomly kill cops.
[00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:35.649]  I mean, you're light years worse than these police, and it just shows a society absolutely falling apart.
[00:46:36.784 --> 00:46:38.244]  Absolutely falling apart.
[00:46:38.244 --> 00:46:42.225]  Killing the police isn't going to do anything but get a civil war going.
[00:46:42.225 --> 00:46:43.985]  Most police are good men and women.
[00:46:43.985 --> 00:46:46.146]  Most departments are revenue generating.
[00:46:46.146 --> 00:46:48.366]  They don't know they're designed to ruin the economy.
[00:46:48.366 --> 00:46:51.207]  They don't know why people hate them because they don't have the money to pay these tickets.
[00:46:51.207 --> 00:46:52.567]  I mean, I was talking to one of my crew.
[00:46:52.567 --> 00:46:57.728]  He was up there dealing with a ticket and he saw poor families and stuff, you know, two, three thousand dollar stuff on tickets and things.
[00:46:57.728 --> 00:47:03.729]  Now they've jacked up in Texas and the people will turn around and cry because that's that's the that's the grocery money, folks.
[00:47:04.389 --> 00:47:08.452]  I mean, this country's in a depression, and they're just squeezing.
[00:47:08.452 --> 00:47:12.174]  And so, even quote, good cops have an evil job now, because the government's evil.
[00:47:12.174 --> 00:47:17.117]  You have an evil mission, I don't care what propaganda you put on it, but they're not individually evil.
[00:47:17.117 --> 00:47:20.259]  And we want to avoid the Civil War.
[00:47:20.259 --> 00:47:23.441]  If, you know, they start coming for people and stuff, it's the gloves are off.
[00:47:23.441 --> 00:47:27.143]  And it's going to be a million times, I mean, way more than a million times dorner.
[00:47:29.253 --> 00:47:35.417]  That's why the system is going to stage stuff to get the psychological war won, to blame anyone that resists as terrorist.
[00:47:35.417 --> 00:47:36.597]  But the system should look.
[00:47:36.597 --> 00:47:43.381]  The public hates you so much, they're wanting the public to kill your children.
[00:47:43.381 --> 00:47:44.822]  And that's why I don't want a revolution.
[00:47:44.822 --> 00:47:47.844]  A lot of times revolutions create something worse than what you had.
[00:47:47.844 --> 00:47:49.505]  I want the Republic back.
[00:47:49.505 --> 00:47:50.865]  I want due process back.
[00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:53.207]  I want honorable behavior back.
[00:47:53.207 --> 00:47:56.649]  I want to put this monster back in the cage, okay?
[00:47:57.665 --> 00:47:58.966]  Believe me, I got a family.
[00:47:58.966 --> 00:47:59.746]  I've studied history.
[00:47:59.746 --> 00:48:01.507]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:48:01.507 --> 00:48:04.408]  This country's on the edge of a powder keg.
[00:48:04.408 --> 00:48:09.290]  And the government's gearing up for checkpoints, martial law, you know, to crush the resistance once it starts.
[00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:13.932]  They're gonna start the resistance, you idiots out there in law enforcement.
[00:48:13.932 --> 00:48:17.374]  Maybe you're not as naive as the public, but you still don't get the trap you're being set up for.
[00:48:20.114 --> 00:48:22.356]  Let's go out to break with my prediction.
[00:48:22.356 --> 00:48:25.578]  I'm not going to play the whole thing, but where I play the wolf blitzer and the rest of it.
[00:48:25.578 --> 00:48:27.900]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip that's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.102]  Here it is two hours before they torched him.
[00:48:30.102 --> 00:48:34.005]  The Chris Dorner fiasco appears to be coming to a head.
[00:48:34.005 --> 00:48:37.028]  Alex Jones with InfoWars.com news alert.
[00:48:37.028 --> 00:48:39.029]  We were just in here watching CNN.
[00:48:39.029 --> 00:48:41.852]  They claim that they've cornered him in some house.
[00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:46.576]  There's been some type of shootout in Big Bear, California up in the Snowcapped Mountains.
[00:48:47.156 --> 00:48:56.881]  The issue here though is that now CNN especially refuses to show live footage and is just telling us what they're seeing from the helicopter.
[00:48:56.881 --> 00:49:05.466]  In the past this was never done except for situations like Waco where they ordered the news cameras back and then the place blew up in flames.
[00:49:05.466 --> 00:49:08.928]  He's reportedly got several hostages inside there.
[00:49:09.908 --> 00:49:19.931]  What the police tend to do and the military tends to do in a situation like this where they've lost some of their own, they don't care about 17 little children under the age of 10 in the Waco compound.
[00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:21.832]  They blew it up and burned it to the ground.
[00:49:21.832 --> 00:49:23.672]  And I hope that doesn't happen here.
[00:49:23.672 --> 00:49:27.553]  But regardless, this is why people don't believe official stories.
[00:49:27.553 --> 00:49:36.356]  It's because over and over again, we're going to play the clip in a moment, the establishment media is caught lying about things, spinning things, and then not letting us see what's really happening.
[00:49:36.636 --> 00:49:46.423]  A few weeks ago at a shooting in Houston at a community college, they cut the feed and were saying different things than what we were watching on local Texas television with live feeds.
[00:49:46.423 --> 00:49:49.266]  They kept showing the scariest footage over and over again.
[00:49:49.266 --> 00:49:53.429]  They also do that to control the narrative and what's put out.
[00:49:53.429 --> 00:49:54.549]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:49:54.549 --> 00:50:00.074]  We have our guns because of government people like the alleged killer Chris Dorner that go crazy.
[00:50:00.874 --> 00:50:03.475]  When the government has all the guns, there's tyranny.
[00:50:03.475 --> 00:50:05.716]  When the people have the guns, there is liberty.
[00:50:05.716 --> 00:50:07.797]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[00:50:07.797 --> 00:50:09.658]  When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[00:50:09.658 --> 00:50:10.899]  That's Thomas Jefferson.
[00:50:10.899 --> 00:50:12.259]  It's common sense.
[00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:15.481]  But let's go ahead and show you this clip.
[00:50:16.141 --> 00:50:19.964]  And again, they're still saying earlier... Commissioner, it's Wolf Blitzer.
[00:50:19.964 --> 00:50:23.567]  We're watching what's going on here in the Situation Room as well.
[00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:37.919]  We are now showing our viewers videotape of the aerial area after a law enforcement asked us no longer to show live pictures because that could help the suspect in this particular case potentially escape.
[00:50:37.919 --> 00:50:40.821]  So what our viewers now are seeing is videotape.
[00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:42.983]  We're no longer going to show the live pictures.
[00:50:42.983 --> 00:50:43.624]  We've got to go to break.
[00:50:44.634 --> 00:50:49.001]  And I go on to finish the clip, and Blitzer, of course, talked about this is unprecedented.
[00:50:49.001 --> 00:50:53.527]  Well, except for Waco and places, and I say, that's when they're usually going to torch something.
[00:50:53.527 --> 00:50:54.849]  So, there's the prediction.
[00:50:54.849 --> 00:50:57.012]  The full video's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:58.074]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[00:50:58.074 --> 00:51:00.457]  Then the State of the Union, right now, scariest ever.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.863]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year.
[00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:16.147]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[00:51:16.147 --> 00:51:22.590]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:28.933]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my
[00:51:28.973 --> 00:51:32.175]  I got my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[00:51:32.175 --> 00:51:36.218]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[00:51:36.218 --> 00:51:38.780]  Heed common sense's warning and do what I've done.

[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.541]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:07.923]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:52:07.923 --> 00:52:10.884]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:52:10.884 --> 00:52:21.809]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:52:21.809 --> 00:52:22.950]  Then there's affordability.
[00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:27.892]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, even
[00:52:27.892 --> 00:52:28.572]  I think so.
[00:52:55.506 --> 00:52:57.527]  Free shipping on every order over $50.
[00:52:57.527 --> 00:53:00.829]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:01.890]  Social unrest.
[00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:02.931]  Food shortages.
[00:53:02.931 --> 00:53:04.091]  Political turmoil.
[00:53:04.091 --> 00:53:05.092]  EMPs.
[00:53:05.092 --> 00:53:05.772]  Earthquakes.
[00:53:05.772 --> 00:53:06.553]  Tornadoes.
[00:53:06.553 --> 00:53:07.293]  Hurricanes.
[00:53:07.293 --> 00:53:08.014]  Fires.
[00:53:08.014 --> 00:53:08.594]  Riots.
[00:53:08.594 --> 00:53:09.175]  Flooding.
[00:53:09.175 --> 00:53:11.156]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[00:53:11.156 --> 00:53:12.557]  What if it happened right now?
[00:53:12.557 --> 00:53:15.459]  Would you have the supplies to survive Off The Grid?

[00:54:08.633 --> 00:54:10.959]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:15.048]  I'm going to take about 30-40 minutes of calls.
[00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:25.612]  And then I'm going to properly get into Obama's State of the Union because, I'll be honest, I didn't watch it last night.
[00:54:25.612 --> 00:54:28.213]  I read the transcript this morning.
[00:54:28.213 --> 00:54:32.754]  I read the whole stinking thing and then I went and found some of the clips and the crew found some.
[00:54:32.754 --> 00:54:43.197]  Economic development zones, taking over the internet with executive orders outside of Congress, end of free speech as you know it really, even mainstream media says that, Chinese style net censorship.
[00:54:44.774 --> 00:54:48.336]  Carbon taxes, executive orders, even if Congress quote won't act.
[00:54:48.336 --> 00:54:51.398]  We've got a clip of that in a moment.
[00:54:51.398 --> 00:54:53.019]  During the break, I was looking at this again.
[00:54:53.019 --> 00:54:55.181]  It's just making my head spin.
[00:54:55.181 --> 00:54:56.742]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:02.289]  I mean, they're burning up people alive and saying they didn't in front of us.
[00:55:02.289 --> 00:55:04.070]  Let's burn him up, okay?
[00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:05.010]  But we didn't burn him up.
[00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.071]  I mean, it's reached cuckoo level.
[00:55:07.071 --> 00:55:09.212]  And I've got the economic news.
[00:55:09.212 --> 00:55:10.913]  They want to deep six things.
[00:55:10.913 --> 00:55:12.353]  They want you poor.
[00:55:12.353 --> 00:55:14.815]  On record, this is not an opinion.
[00:55:14.815 --> 00:55:16.155]  This is so diabolical.
[00:55:16.155 --> 00:55:18.336]  And I just want prosperity.
[00:55:18.336 --> 00:55:19.457]  But see, they don't want that.
[00:55:19.457 --> 00:55:21.157]  They don't want you to be independent.
[00:55:21.157 --> 00:55:24.379]  And it makes me so mad because it's so over the top.
[00:55:24.379 --> 00:55:26.320]  We should just be able to wake up to this.
[00:55:28.376 --> 00:55:29.877]  Now, I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[00:55:29.877 --> 00:55:32.019]  Sandy, Carl, Abby, Bobby, Jason.
[00:55:32.019 --> 00:55:33.440]  We're going to get to all of you.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.881]  Be sure to support the broadcast.
[00:55:34.881 --> 00:55:36.222]  Spread the word about the broadcast.

[00:56:21.205 --> 00:56:24.206]  Now we'll start the next hour and go to all your calls.
[00:56:24.206 --> 00:56:33.150]  I'm going to take five or six calls and then I'm going to clear the board and I'm going to open it up for police to call in and give us their take on what they've seen and heard.
[00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:34.631]  Shooting innocent people,
[00:56:36.883 --> 00:56:42.948]  The infantry tactic of using the armored vehicle to ram it on the walls and set it on fire just reminds me of Waco, makes me so angry.
[00:56:42.948 --> 00:56:44.810]  It's one thing to kill this guy.
[00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:51.335]  You can debate that all day, but man, I tell you, those little kids and how the system lied about that, really despicable.
[00:56:51.335 --> 00:56:53.157]  It shows you what the system will do if ordered.
[00:56:53.717 --> 00:56:57.259]  The good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.
[00:57:18.775 --> 00:57:28.818]  I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.
[00:57:28.818 --> 00:57:35.100]  But, if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:35.740]  I will direct
[00:57:38.658 --> 00:57:52.063]  I will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take now and in the future to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.
[00:57:52.063 --> 00:57:56.545]  That means shutting down our power plants and then giving boondoggles to energy companies that don't exist.
[00:57:56.545 --> 00:57:57.965]  Billions of dollars to their friends.
[00:57:57.965 --> 00:57:59.046]  This is a mafia.
[00:57:59.426 --> 00:58:01.408]  I don't care if they land in Air Force One helicopters.
[00:58:01.408 --> 00:58:06.072]  I don't care if they're wearing fancy suits and green ribbons for Sandy Hook for what they probably did.
[00:58:06.072 --> 00:58:08.494]  You know, the issue is we're in trouble.
[00:58:09.634 --> 00:58:12.695]  And the globalists have built China up as the new command base.
[00:58:12.695 --> 00:58:14.857]  They have no standards or regulations on them.
[00:58:14.857 --> 00:58:16.157]  We have them piled on us.
[00:58:16.157 --> 00:58:16.897]  It's over.
[00:58:16.897 --> 00:58:27.242]  It'd be like playing a football field where one team is up on the mountain with a Gatling gun, and you've got rocks and stones, and you've got to go up and beat them when they've got a machine gun at the top of the hill.
[00:58:27.242 --> 00:58:28.763]  I mean, it's that slanted.
[00:58:28.763 --> 00:58:32.905]  But if we wake up to the scam, we can just say, wait, this is all a giant fraud.
[00:58:32.905 --> 00:58:36.126]  But instead, it's all about how he's going to get you jobs.
[00:58:36.126 --> 00:58:38.808]  What Obama's going to do is put you on welfare to run your life.
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:51.643]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.643 --> 00:58:55.044]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:58:55.044 --> 00:59:01.086]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:59:01.086 --> 00:59:04.968]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[00:59:04.968 --> 00:59:06.568]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[00:59:54.184 --> 00:59:56.585]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.585 --> 01:00:05.967]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:07.288]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.288 --> 01:00:09.048]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:09.048 --> 01:00:10.809]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.809 --> 01:00:12.389]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.389 --> 01:00:13.930]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:18.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.131 --> 01:00:22.232]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.936 --> 01:00:30.437]  Alright, we're taking your calls in this hour.
[01:00:30.437 --> 01:00:38.543]  We're going to recap the Dorner-Waco torching and the government thinking we're so dumb they admit on the scanners they burned him up and tried to deny it.
[01:00:38.543 --> 01:00:45.007]  We're going to Obama's State of the Union and, as I said, take your phone calls and a bunch of news on the economy that's bone-chilling.
[01:00:45.007 --> 01:00:49.750]  But again, knowing about this and understanding it's premeditated, it is half the battle.
[01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.671]  Sandy in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:00:51.671 --> 01:00:52.252]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:52.970 --> 01:01:15.155]  Yeah Alex, I just gotta say I want the officers to know my son-in-law was an officer up until maybe seven months ago because his captain came in it was a new military guy he saw changes coming but we need to let these officers know don't leave we need the good ones in there we you know they're gonna get scared they don't like the changes but the more good ones we get in there
[01:01:16.377 --> 01:01:17.898]  The more they can change these things.
[01:01:17.898 --> 01:01:23.863]  Well, it's not just that the military guys are sending in to command them are bad, they're getting the bad guys out of the military.
[01:01:23.863 --> 01:01:27.626]  Who are psychos, just want to kill people, and they're putting them in charge.
[01:01:27.626 --> 01:01:32.050]  Yeah, I mean their whole, the look, and everything they had to do now is a complete change.
[01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:39.396]  Well, it's all meant to intimidate people, and instead it's getting the public thinking it's an occupying army and wanting to, you know, like white blood cells to attack the invader.
[01:01:40.219 --> 01:02:02.366]  And then last night, a bunch of us were watching, you know, the President, and of course, Gerald Solente, my other hero next to you, was tweeting back and forth with some of us on Facebook and things, and all I kept thinking is, if before Hitler could have gotten his hands on anybody, if we would have had the system we have now to get information out, it probably wouldn't have happened.
[01:02:02.366 --> 01:02:09.188]  But I'm afraid if Obama gets the Internet control, we will lose this battle very quickly.
[01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:12.672]  I absolutely agree with you.
[01:02:12.672 --> 01:02:21.094]  Again, Obama's there as the puppet who's supposed to bring in the change, then he takes all the blame, so the globalists, in case they lose this round, don't get in trouble.
[01:02:21.094 --> 01:02:26.555]  But it's important to politically shoot down Obama's agenda as well, because that's what they're rolling this through on.
[01:02:26.555 --> 01:02:35.957]  But you've got to understand, it's just the latest salvo, the latest missile coming in that our Aegis or Aegis system has to shoot down.
[01:02:35.957 --> 01:02:39.158]  We need to understand there's a command ship launching these people at us.
[01:02:40.014 --> 01:02:41.435]  Thank you for the call, Sandy.
[01:02:41.435 --> 01:02:44.738]  Abby in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:02:44.738 --> 01:02:46.219]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:46.219 --> 01:02:49.602]  I had a... well, what do you think?
[01:02:49.602 --> 01:02:54.687]  I had a thing about the Storner case with the wallet.
[01:02:54.687 --> 01:03:03.534]  They found... apparently found it close to Mexico on the side of the road, and then all of a sudden they find it in the building after it burns down.
[01:03:03.534 --> 01:03:06.317]  I mean, I think that's kind of coincidental that they find his wallet.
[01:03:07.037 --> 01:03:11.140]  Sure, maybe there's a 5% chance this could be a state psyop.
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:19.705]  It's just that it's so bad for them and it shows how pathetically weak they are to asymmetrical resistance.
[01:03:19.705 --> 01:03:23.828]  It's such a PR disaster and shooting up innocent people's cars.
[01:03:23.828 --> 01:03:26.890]  Let me tell you, I mean just all the MO of this looks like it's real.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.802]  I was also reading online.
[01:03:30.802 --> 01:03:36.346]  I found a few news things online that were saying that the manifesto that he made was actually altered and changed.
[01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:39.429]  There's two different versions of it.
[01:03:39.429 --> 01:03:42.972]  He was putting it on Facebook and other sites.
[01:03:42.972 --> 01:03:46.395]  Listen, I've read Fruit Loop, Narcissist, Tough Guy stuff.
[01:03:46.395 --> 01:03:52.820]  If he didn't write this, the person deserves a Nobel Prize in Literature.
[01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:57.436]  I'm not saying that he's innocent or guilty.
[01:03:57.436 --> 01:04:02.780]  I'm just saying I think it's kind of funny that all this contradiction stuff is coming out, and it's blatantly obvious.
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.121]  I mean, they're not even trying to cover it up anymore.
[01:04:06.121 --> 01:04:13.025]  Nobody, oh, oh, he did it, oh, he's a bad guy, go kill him and stuff, and then they open up the investigation to appease him?
[01:04:14.366 --> 01:04:15.006]  No, I won't.
[01:04:15.006 --> 01:04:19.789]  See, that was to make it look like, because they make him a bad guy, well, how can the bad guy be winning?
[01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:25.151]  So they just went with the political correctness because he's an Obama supporter and an anti-gun guy.
[01:04:25.151 --> 01:04:27.352]  The media was kind of like, well, maybe he is good then.
[01:04:27.352 --> 01:04:33.055]  You know, because, see, once they fully take over, they're going to hang the cops out to dry and the military as well.
[01:04:33.055 --> 01:04:35.076]  They're already hanging the military out to dry.
[01:04:35.076 --> 01:04:35.837]  So God bless you.
[01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:36.277]  Good points.
[01:04:38.218 --> 01:04:42.521]  If the government's a bunch of congenital liars, I don't out of hand believe what they say.
[01:04:42.521 --> 01:04:43.421]  But I've just studied that.
[01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:47.603]  Look, I knew they were going to burn him out yesterday.
[01:04:47.603 --> 01:04:49.184]  I mean, I was even more direct with the office.
[01:04:49.184 --> 01:04:50.425]  I said, they will burn him up.
[01:04:50.425 --> 01:04:52.406]  Watch this.
[01:04:52.406 --> 01:04:55.648]  So, you know, the point is, is that I know these people.
[01:04:55.648 --> 01:04:56.028]  Okay?
[01:04:56.028 --> 01:04:57.369]  I know how they operate.
[01:04:57.369 --> 01:04:59.190]  This is a PR nightmare for them.
[01:05:01.357 --> 01:05:04.819]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:05:04.819 --> 01:05:10.763]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:05:10.763 --> 01:05:17.368]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:05:17.368 --> 01:05:23.051]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:26.694]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:05:26.874 --> 01:05:30.677]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:35.282]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:05:35.282 --> 01:05:37.784]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:05:37.784 --> 01:05:41.647]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:46.072]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:48.714]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:05:49.014 --> 01:05:55.839]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:05:55.839 --> 01:06:01.983]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[01:06:01.983 --> 01:06:07.808]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[01:06:08.729 --> 01:06:15.472]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[01:06:26.436 --> 01:06:30.558]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:06:30.558 --> 01:06:36.761]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:48.755]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:07:00.992 --> 01:07:06.477]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year.
[01:07:06.477 --> 01:07:15.765]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:22.010]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:31.795]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[01:07:31.795 --> 01:07:32.555]  Bottom line?
[01:07:32.555 --> 01:07:35.857]  It's better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[01:07:35.857 --> 01:07:37.298]  Heed common sense's warning.
[01:07:37.498 --> 01:07:38.398]  And do what I've done.

[01:08:06.141 --> 01:08:10.982]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:10.982 --> 01:08:12.563]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.563 --> 01:08:14.103]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.103 --> 01:08:18.305]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.305 --> 01:08:22.366]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:24.446 --> 01:08:27.287]  All right, my friends, we're now into hour number two.
[01:08:27.287 --> 01:08:29.648]  We're going to have open phones throughout the next two hours.
[01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:32.669]  We have a guest popping in to break down some key intel.
[01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:39.552]  I'm also lining up guests tomorrow, radio talk show hosts who live right in the area of where Dorner was reportedly
[01:08:40.666 --> 01:08:48.330]  Torched Waco style yesterday who know people that were right in the very vicinity so they're there today doing an investigation.
[01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:56.215]  We'll have some of those folks on like Dr. Corey Gold tomorrow who lives in the area to break that down with us.
[01:08:56.215 --> 01:09:00.397]  We'd have him on today but he's in the area investigating right now.
[01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:02.959]  So he'll be joining us tomorrow so we don't go off.
[01:09:04.369 --> 01:09:05.530]  So we don't go off half-cocked.
[01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:13.294]  And Joseph Farah is on tomorrow to talk about his prediction of just Obama going hog-wild with carbon taxes, police state, cyber security.
[01:09:13.294 --> 01:09:14.755]  That's all tomorrow as well.
[01:09:14.755 --> 01:09:24.841]  You know, I've got these clips, and we're going to cover this mainly in the next hour, because I want to go to calls right now, where Obama, you know, said, hey, if Congress doesn't bring in carbon taxes, I'm going to do it.
[01:09:25.501 --> 01:09:27.102]  With executive orders.
[01:09:27.102 --> 01:09:31.046]  And he's really trying to sell the dictator angle to try to get that out there.
[01:09:31.046 --> 01:09:33.949]  If I'll get the economy going, just let me be a dictator.
[01:09:33.949 --> 01:09:35.710]  Very, very serious.
[01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:39.193]  And they've got so many reasons to impeach him already.
[01:09:39.193 --> 01:09:43.557]  Putting our troops under UN control, NATO control.
[01:09:43.557 --> 01:09:48.101]  Trying to keep cyber security orders secret from Congress, saying they have no authority.
[01:09:48.101 --> 01:09:51.384]  This is just all fast and furious, totally impeachable.
[01:09:51.384 --> 01:09:52.445]  Why is it not happening?
[01:09:53.757 --> 01:09:56.438]  Now, I got loaded phones here.
[01:09:56.438 --> 01:10:08.802]  After we go to these five or six callers that are on the top of the board, I want to leave the new phone lines that are open for police, current police, who'd like to call in or form or whatever, to give us your take on what we've seen.
[01:10:08.802 --> 01:10:15.765]  The LAPD shooting up innocent vehicles and people that are, a white guy in a car, doesn't match the description, shoot it up.
[01:10:16.305 --> 01:10:18.148]  Can you imagine being a black guy in a similar truck?
[01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:20.372]  I mean, you don't deserve to die.
[01:10:20.372 --> 01:10:25.361]  Women, white women in a blue truck, different make, model, different company.
[01:10:25.361 --> 01:10:26.022]  Shoot them up!
[01:10:27.304 --> 01:10:33.726]  And then the audio caught live on the news of the scanner, them saying, burn it down, burn the mother-effer down.
[01:10:33.726 --> 01:10:35.206]  I'm going to play a clip of that in a moment.
[01:10:35.206 --> 01:10:39.227]  And then the actual scanner audio, they asked the news to cut, but one of them didn't.
[01:10:39.227 --> 01:10:49.050]  This is confirmed, where they bring in the armored vehicle, knock down the walls, and then say, okay, we got the fire, we're going to bring the fire in, okay, set the burners, they're ignited, the place is on fire.
[01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:50.570]  I mean, they way-code it.
[01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.891]  Now, I'm glad there weren't 17 little children in there.
[01:10:54.725 --> 01:10:59.528]  And I'm no fan of this guy, but I mean, the due process out the window.
[01:10:59.528 --> 01:11:00.828]  And now we'll never know the truth.
[01:11:00.828 --> 01:11:05.311]  I mean, I tend to see the manifesto, the witnesses to what he was doing, the phone calls made.
[01:11:05.311 --> 01:11:08.272]  I mean, it sounds like it's a real story, a real rogue.
[01:11:08.272 --> 01:11:09.413]  You know, sometimes things are real.
[01:11:09.413 --> 01:11:10.694]  They're not staged.
[01:11:10.694 --> 01:11:14.516]  The way it's all a PR disaster, you know, shows you that's probably not staged.
[01:11:14.516 --> 01:11:16.477]  When they stage something, they've got their ducks in a row.
[01:11:17.037 --> 01:11:18.698]  Like Aurora, definitely staged.
[01:11:18.698 --> 01:11:20.520]  I mean, my goodness, the guy got DARPA funding.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:21.961]  Department of Defense was over that guy.
[01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:25.483]  Uh, five different psychotropics, witnesses of other people.
[01:11:25.483 --> 01:11:26.604]  Said he was under mind control.
[01:11:26.604 --> 01:11:27.685]  He's been declassified.
[01:11:27.685 --> 01:11:30.066]  Saran Saran was, uh, under mind control.
[01:11:30.066 --> 01:11:32.268]  I mean, you know, this stuff's all coming out.
[01:11:33.405 --> 01:11:34.747]  But this is very suspicious.
[01:11:34.747 --> 01:11:47.501]  I want to play these clips again and go to your phone calls for people that are holding, like Ron in New York, former police officer Robert in Florida, Bobby, Jason, and many others that are patiently holding right now.
[01:11:47.501 --> 01:11:49.984]  The toll-free number for police to call in is 800-259-9231.
[01:11:49.984 --> 01:11:50.925]  Just wait until you hear somebody
[01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.690]  Hang up and then call in.
[01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:57.711]  Callers, please, just, I want to hear from the police.
[01:11:57.711 --> 01:12:01.114]  So, after we take these calls, don't try to call in.
[01:12:01.114 --> 01:12:02.414]  Not that anyone listens to me.
[01:12:02.414 --> 01:12:03.435]  Police only.
[01:12:03.435 --> 01:12:04.396]  After I take these calls.
[01:12:04.396 --> 01:12:05.156]  800-259-9231.
[01:12:05.156 --> 01:12:07.718]  We gotta move quick here.
[01:12:07.718 --> 01:12:10.460]  Let's go to the local TV clip.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:20.306]  And again, the video of this is all up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and DrudgeReport.com is carrying our, well, we broke this, so thanks to Drudge putting it out.
[01:12:20.306 --> 01:12:21.627]  Now it's broken everywhere.
[01:12:21.627 --> 01:12:24.109]  And it's getting past the mainstream media, ignoring it.
[01:12:24.769 --> 01:12:25.810]  This is all over.
[01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:27.750]  I tuned into three talk radio shows.
[01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:28.311]  I called into 590.
[01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:33.092]  And I tuned into WOAI, and I tuned into a big Dallas station.
[01:12:33.092 --> 01:12:34.873]  I forget which one.
[01:12:34.873 --> 01:12:35.774]  I forget the call letters.
[01:12:35.774 --> 01:12:36.914]  I'm getting old.
[01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:40.775]  And they were all talking about them burning it down when I tuned in.
[01:12:40.775 --> 01:12:42.816]  Stuck in traffic for like an hour this morning.
[01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:43.797]  Really bad traffic.
[01:12:43.797 --> 01:12:46.678]  But side issue, it was all drudge.
[01:12:47.677 --> 01:12:48.918]  That's why.
[01:12:48.918 --> 01:12:53.944]  So our report is mega viral right now out at InfoWars.com via Drudge.
[01:12:53.944 --> 01:12:55.106]  DrudgeReport.com.
[01:12:55.106 --> 01:13:01.973]  Okay, let's go to this first clip from KCAL where we bleep the cuss words with the police saying, burn that mother effer down.
[01:13:01.973 --> 01:13:02.274]  Here it is.
[01:13:30.558 --> 01:13:34.100]  And then they run over the reporter and tell him to get out of the area.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:37.341]  Police officers, understandably upset.
[01:13:38.186 --> 01:13:44.089]  And again, that was live, and a listener there in the area shot it off the video, off the TV.
[01:13:44.089 --> 01:13:45.710]  They don't want this stuff being seen.
[01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.771]  Now, here is the official scanner.
[01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:50.012]  They wanted cut, but didn't get cut.
[01:13:50.012 --> 01:13:54.434]  Here is the armored vehicle, knocking down the walls and setting it on fire.
[01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:59.356]  Bombshell, that they would do this in front of everyone, and you watch, it'll never even be an issue.
[01:13:59.356 --> 01:14:00.477]  You're a conspirator.
[01:14:00.477 --> 01:14:03.638]  I guarantee you, there'll be articles out by this afternoon.
[01:14:03.638 --> 01:14:04.759]  If not now, I have it checked.
[01:14:05.931 --> 01:14:13.194]  Saying Matt Drudge is crazy, Alex Jones is crazy, it's a conspiracy theory that they burned this down.
[01:14:13.194 --> 01:14:14.494]  Guaranteed!
[01:14:14.494 --> 01:14:18.216]  Doesn't matter, you got them, they burned it down, boom.
[01:14:18.216 --> 01:14:22.417]  Again, if you said 2 plus 2 equaled 4, they'd say you were a conspiracy theorist.
[01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:24.438]  If you know how to tie your shoelaces, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:14:25.285 --> 01:14:27.266]  You watch Obama shutting down power plants every week?
[01:14:27.266 --> 01:14:28.386]  Everybody going bankrupt?
[01:14:28.386 --> 01:14:29.567]  Are power prices going up?
[01:14:29.567 --> 01:14:30.727]  Say that's bad for the economy?
[01:14:30.727 --> 01:14:32.228]  You're a conspiracy terrorist.
[01:14:32.228 --> 01:14:34.189]  If you've got common sense, you're a conspiracy terrorist.
[01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:36.290]  Well, welcome to Conspiracy Theory.
[01:14:36.290 --> 01:14:37.430]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:38.891]  Here it is.
[01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:44.694]  Alright Steve, we're gonna go forward with the plan with the burner.
[01:14:44.694 --> 01:14:46.975]  Got it.
[01:14:46.975 --> 01:14:51.537]  We want it like we talked about.
[01:14:51.537 --> 01:14:53.878]  Seven burners deployed and we have a fire.
[01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:55.506]  Copy.
[01:14:55.506 --> 01:14:57.288]  7 cars deployed and we have a fire.
[01:14:57.288 --> 01:14:58.729]  You guys be ready on the number 4 side.
[01:14:58.729 --> 01:15:00.189]  We have fire in the front.
[01:15:00.189 --> 01:15:02.731]  It might come out the back.
[01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:07.114]  Woman on the 4 side, remember your back drops.
[01:15:07.114 --> 01:15:07.394]  6-2-2-3-1.
[01:15:07.394 --> 01:15:09.055]  Contact fire.
[01:15:09.055 --> 01:15:12.718]  It is staging up on the 38 in Glass Road.
[01:15:12.718 --> 01:15:15.840]  Can you have him bring an engine down here?
[01:15:24.077 --> 01:15:30.586]  The unedited audio is a bunch of it is up at InfoWars.com right now in the article.
[01:15:37.335 --> 01:15:41.618]  Police audio from Dorner Siege burned this mother bleeper.
[01:15:41.618 --> 01:15:44.620]  All right, we're going to go ahead with a plan with the burners.
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:47.582]  And we cut the spaces out of that for radio.
[01:15:47.582 --> 01:15:50.724]  You know here where the guy's going, OK, place the burners.
[01:15:50.724 --> 01:15:52.945]  He goes, like we talked about in private.
[01:15:52.945 --> 01:15:54.587]  Yes, place the burners.
[01:15:55.327 --> 01:15:56.408]  Do it!
[01:15:56.408 --> 01:15:57.490]  We ought to just air the whole thing.
[01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:01.955]  I mean, it's so ridiculous that they would do this and think we don't know what's going on.
[01:16:01.955 --> 01:16:04.358]  Okay, we'll go to Ron in New York, former police officer.
[01:16:04.358 --> 01:16:05.079]  It's the Ron I know.
[01:16:05.079 --> 01:16:07.382]  He's been giving us great info for about 13 years.
[01:16:07.382 --> 01:16:08.724]  We gotta move quick, Ron.
[01:16:08.724 --> 01:16:10.386]  What's your take on this whole situation?
[01:16:11.309 --> 01:16:13.371]  Um, with Dorner, I thought it's strange.
[01:16:13.371 --> 01:16:16.914]  They now said, you know, there's always weird things every time something like this happens.
[01:16:16.914 --> 01:16:18.836]  It never adds up and connects right.
[01:16:18.836 --> 01:16:22.539]  They said that they found his driver's license near his body.
[01:16:22.539 --> 01:16:26.603]  Uh, now, first off, how could a driver's license survive that inferno?
[01:16:26.603 --> 01:16:36.452]  Second off, why would a guy who didn't care less about murdering a number of people, like a good citizen, carry his driver's license around like he was afraid that he was, you know, gonna get stopped for a speeding ticket?
[01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:43.315]  And even if by some chance he had his driver's license, most people tend to keep it on them in their back pocket.
[01:16:43.315 --> 01:16:49.518]  Yet they said they found it, according to news reports today, near his body in the infernal wreckage.
[01:16:49.518 --> 01:16:50.599]  Which doesn't make sense to me.
[01:16:50.599 --> 01:16:56.562]  That sounds like 9-11 where two passports survived the fireballs, made it to the ground, and were found that day by the FBI.
[01:16:57.481 --> 01:16:58.722]  It does sound a lot like that.
[01:16:58.722 --> 01:17:09.630]  And plus, did you notice another thing here, an irony, that they finished Dorner off just about a half hour before the State of the Union address, like, as though they didn't want it to overshadow the State of the Union.
[01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:11.311]  He's like a burnt offering or something.
[01:17:11.311 --> 01:17:12.492]  Yeah, but I mean, here's the deal.
[01:17:12.492 --> 01:17:14.353]  This is a PR disaster for them.
[01:17:14.353 --> 01:17:17.756]  The cops shooting up innocent people and things.
[01:17:17.756 --> 01:17:19.457]  The kind of narcissism in the letters.
[01:17:19.457 --> 01:17:23.420]  I mean, my gut tells me that at least a large portion of this is real.
[01:17:25.046 --> 01:17:31.529]  They're blindsided because something happened, which doesn't happen that often, but one of their own, one of the insiders, went rogue.
[01:17:31.529 --> 01:17:32.590]  A loose cannon.
[01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:34.331]  And, of course, that threw them off balance.
[01:17:34.331 --> 01:17:35.711]  How do you deal with something like that?
[01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:37.472]  It takes a while to adjust to it.
[01:17:37.472 --> 01:17:39.193]  And I think that's what happened.
[01:17:39.193 --> 01:17:48.558]  But, you know, Alex, getting to another thing, too, on another issue with the State of the Union, uh, did you notice that that person, uh, John Bonny's supposed to be pro-gun, right?
[01:17:48.558 --> 01:17:53.260]  Yet when Obama's mentioned gun control, he stood on his feet and chapped and clapped.
[01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:59.020]  Yeah, and John McCain was wearing the ribbons and everything and having little snickerdoodle times.
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.222]  It's a bunch of disgusting people.
[01:18:01.222 --> 01:18:02.102]  You know?
[01:18:02.102 --> 01:18:18.613]  And also, there was an article in USA Today with Wayne LaPierre, harping on an issue that's very similar to the issue with veterans, where out of one side of his mouth he says in the past that's no good, in the recent past, now he's harping on that and he's kind of intimating that that is good.
[01:18:19.173 --> 01:18:20.494]  You know something?
[01:18:20.494 --> 01:18:27.920]  We not only have enemies to the front of us that are clearly definable on the Second Amendment, but I think we better be very careful as to who we got to the back of us.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:34.205]  Well, the NRA's always been anti-gun at its core, but good folks have tried to take it back over, but you're absolutely right.
[01:18:34.205 --> 01:18:34.786]  Got to jump.
[01:18:34.786 --> 01:18:36.487]  Good to hear from you, Ron.
[01:18:36.487 --> 01:18:39.950]  Let's talk to Robert, who's a retired police officer.
[01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:41.852]  What's your take on this situation, Robert?
[01:18:43.157 --> 01:18:44.338]  Hey, I'm supposed to speak to you.
[01:18:44.338 --> 01:18:45.178]  No, I'm not retired.
[01:18:45.178 --> 01:18:48.321]  I just didn't want to finish out my term there.
[01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:52.123]  Things are just getting a little bit too political and too heated for my cup of tea.
[01:18:52.123 --> 01:18:55.265]  So I'm just curious, though, what happened with the marshal yesterday that came in?
[01:18:55.265 --> 01:18:56.366]  What did he want?
[01:18:56.366 --> 01:18:56.866]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:58.502 --> 01:19:08.090]  They wanted a source on a story with Marines saying that the reported shooter of Chris Kyle, the sniper, had not been in combat.
[01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:10.232]  And then I called him and said, you never came back.
[01:19:10.232 --> 01:19:15.797]  And he said, no, we were able to actually confirm that through Marines.
[01:19:16.437 --> 01:19:23.402]  Separately, so our story helped them go confirm with other Marines in the unit that indeed the guy wasn't a combat Marine.
[01:19:23.402 --> 01:19:25.804]  He was assigned to a mechanics detail.
[01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:31.467]  So they just want that so they can try to give him a lethal injection instead of him getting off on PTSD.
[01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:34.229]  I mean, the whole thing's very suspicious.
[01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:37.552]  And I wanted to interrogate the Texas Ranger, but he said he was very polite.
[01:19:37.552 --> 01:19:38.893]  He goes, no, sir, I can't talk to you now.
[01:19:38.893 --> 01:19:40.734]  My superiors say click.
[01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.895]  So believe me, I wish I would have gotten a chance to talk to him.
[01:19:42.895 --> 01:19:43.616]  Does that answer your question?
[01:19:44.993 --> 01:19:53.496]  Sure, I'll come back to you briefly on the other side and then we'll go to others that are patiently holding like Bobby, Jason, Carl and many others.
[01:19:53.496 --> 01:19:54.536]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:19:54.536 --> 01:19:57.277]  That's always a riot here at this office, I'll tell you.
[01:20:01.462 --> 01:20:06.928]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year.
[01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:13.856]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.
[01:20:13.856 --> 01:20:16.239]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:20:16.239 --> 01:20:22.446]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:20:22.666 --> 01:20:32.253]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[01:20:32.253 --> 01:20:33.013]  Bottom line?
[01:20:33.013 --> 01:20:36.315]  It's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:20:36.315 --> 01:20:38.877]  Heed common sense's warning and do what I've done.

[01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:06.012]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:21:06.012 --> 01:21:08.113]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:21:09.046 --> 01:21:18.011]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:21:18.011 --> 01:21:22.914]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:22:30.407 --> 01:22:31.648]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.648 --> 01:22:36.211]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:42.015]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.015 --> 01:22:45.657]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.657 --> 01:22:48.379]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.379 --> 01:22:53.442]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.442 --> 01:22:53.683]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.683 --> 01:22:55.084]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:13.782]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[01:23:13.782 --> 01:23:17.206]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:20.670]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game.
[01:23:21.631 --> 01:23:22.932]  But it's not Africa.
[01:23:22.932 --> 01:23:24.493]  It's Argentina.
[01:23:24.493 --> 01:23:33.300]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, cougar, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.182]  All gold medal quality.
[01:23:35.182 --> 01:23:36.743]  All the action you can handle.
[01:23:38.266 --> 01:23:39.427]  We're good to go.
[01:24:14.057 --> 01:24:16.823]  Folks, I have two different news articles.
[01:24:16.823 --> 01:24:17.866]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:24:18.976 --> 01:24:25.278]  He just joined us saying they found his driver's license and passport at two different places, two different times.
[01:24:25.278 --> 01:24:31.081]  Now, I get the fact that the system almost always lies, even when the truth would serve them.
[01:24:31.081 --> 01:24:34.102]  I just don't see why they'd stage this when it's a PR disaster.
[01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:34.562]  But who knows?
[01:24:34.562 --> 01:24:36.343]  They burned up whoever it is in that house.
[01:24:36.343 --> 01:24:39.564]  It's like John Wilkes Booth got burned up in the barn.
[01:24:39.564 --> 01:24:42.025]  The guy that supposedly shot Lincoln.
[01:24:42.025 --> 01:24:43.305]  And we know he had accomplices.
[01:24:43.305 --> 01:24:46.207]  So, I mean, they always burn them up.
[01:24:46.207 --> 01:24:46.447]  So...
[01:24:48.214 --> 01:24:49.615]  Is this a conspiracy too?
[01:24:49.615 --> 01:24:52.938]  I just... I don't know anymore.
[01:24:52.938 --> 01:25:01.085]  All I know is Obama is up there on television saying if Congress doesn't put carbon taxes in, he's gonna do it.
[01:25:01.085 --> 01:25:05.529]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:05.529 --> 01:25:08.172]  Jessica in California says she has info covered.
[01:25:13.138 --> 01:25:21.583]  Yeah, the whole situation just disgusts me.
[01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:26.467]  I mean, like you said earlier, we live in a country where there's no more due process and no more do anything.
[01:25:26.467 --> 01:25:33.451]  It's just, you know, do what you want and how the dictator can stand up in front of everybody and say, OK, I'm going to do this if you don't do this.
[01:25:33.451 --> 01:25:36.453]  I mean, I don't understand why he's not being impeached, being arrested.
[01:25:36.453 --> 01:25:38.515]  I mean, this is when I talk to people.
[01:25:39.162 --> 01:25:42.824]  And I try to spread the word about you and what's going on, you know.
[01:25:42.824 --> 01:25:45.646]  As you know, they laugh and say you're a conspiracy.
[01:25:45.646 --> 01:25:47.807]  And I tell them, you know, this is supposed to be the future.
[01:25:47.807 --> 01:25:51.209]  We're supposed to have jet cars by now, monorails to the moon.
[01:25:51.209 --> 01:25:53.250]  Yet, here we are on the verge of 1776, back in the Dark Ages.
[01:25:55.491 --> 01:26:08.022]  And the whole thing just disgusts me of how... And the government is shutting down our power plants that supply 52% of our power, and the economy is going into a tailspin by design, and these people think it's funny.
[01:26:08.022 --> 01:26:22.115]  What do you make of them torching the compound, torching the house, the... I can't even get it right, going back to Waco, the cabin, and then telling us they didn't torch it when they're on tape, two different clips saying they're going to torch it.
[01:26:23.089 --> 01:26:26.352]  Well it's like you said, 90% of the population is stupid.
[01:26:26.352 --> 01:26:28.794]  They're going to say, oh that didn't happen, what are you talking about?
[01:26:28.794 --> 01:26:34.158]  Even if you play the video or play the audio, they're going to say, oh that's just a photo shot.
[01:26:34.158 --> 01:26:38.482]  No matter what you do, they're going to say, oh it's just a spliced together thing and it ain't real.
[01:26:38.482 --> 01:26:40.964]  And they're just so dumbed down and it's just
[01:26:41.164 --> 01:26:46.809]  Exactly, and it allows the criminals in government to take over and push out the good people, and then you get tyranny.
[01:26:46.809 --> 01:26:48.290]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:54.795]  Let's go to Jessica, since she has info not covered concerning Dorner and the car site where he burned up his car.
[01:26:54.795 --> 01:26:56.856]  Jessica, what can you tell us?
[01:26:56.856 --> 01:27:05.463]  Yeah, I was just calling because the day before all this happened, up the street, I literally lived down the street from where it was, but
[01:27:06.184 --> 01:27:07.744]  Up the street, there was a controlled burn.
[01:27:07.744 --> 01:27:19.588]  The fire department had signs and stuff, but I just thought it was a weird time of year to do that, considering we have snow right now, and it was very small, and it was in the same area where his car was found the next morning.
[01:27:19.588 --> 01:27:22.148]  And, yeah.
[01:27:22.148 --> 01:27:23.689]  I just thought I would let you guys know.
[01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:24.749]  I just thought it was really weird.
[01:27:26.121 --> 01:27:29.762]  Well, you know, I've got to really rack my brain and analyze this.
[01:27:29.762 --> 01:27:31.322]  Why would they stage this?
[01:27:31.322 --> 01:27:32.943]  Again, my gut says it's real.
[01:27:32.943 --> 01:27:35.723]  The evidence all points there.
[01:27:35.723 --> 01:27:39.004]  But then there's a lot of evidence pointing towards cover-up.
[01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:49.127]  And is it just that cops want to be heroes, so they plant fake passports, or they say they found his driver's license at the Mexican border, and now they found it in the cabin, and how did it survive?
[01:27:49.127 --> 01:27:50.287]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:27:50.287 --> 01:27:52.328]  It's just like, there's so much lying.
[01:27:52.328 --> 01:27:53.568]  Who knows what the truth is?
[01:27:54.599 --> 01:27:56.500]  Yeah, that's exactly my point.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.681]  The media hasn't been reporting on any of this.
[01:27:58.681 --> 01:28:05.705]  In fact, one of the houses near mine got raided the day that his truck was found up here.
[01:28:05.705 --> 01:28:10.708]  They said that the door was left open and it's in a pretty busy neighborhood.
[01:28:10.708 --> 01:28:15.131]  There's been traffic up and down all day because of the resort and whatnot.
[01:28:17.598 --> 01:28:21.440]  I don't know, it's just they raided the house and nothing was found.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:28.124]  They walked away laughing and he was hiding in the house directly across the street, a hundred yards away from them the whole time.
[01:28:28.124 --> 01:28:35.227]  Wow, a lot of people out in Southern California think of the police shooting up two vehicles that didn't even match the description.
[01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:38.549]  I feel like that's been kind of brushed under the table.
[01:28:38.549 --> 01:28:41.270]  I feel like the news makes it not seem as big of a deal.
[01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:45.112]  But I mean, how do you hire people so trigger-happy, so crazy,
[01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:54.503]  I mean, I've heard of people that you take deer hunting their first time, and they get butt fever, and they see a cow 300 yards away in somebody else's property, and they shoot cows.
[01:28:54.503 --> 01:28:56.704]  You see it in the news all the time.
[01:28:56.704 --> 01:28:59.565]  And it's like, well, you didn't know that was a cow in the middle of a field?
[01:28:59.565 --> 01:29:00.985]  Well, I just didn't look like a deer.
[01:29:00.985 --> 01:29:05.106]  I thought I... And the truth is, they're just crazy people.
[01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:14.969]  And you've got weirdos that want to be tough guy heroes who go and become police now, and they have no business doing... I mean, it is crazy.
[01:29:15.928 --> 01:29:17.770]  It is crazy.
[01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:23.255]  I mean, I've had cops pull me over and they start asking me questions about PCP and guns and this.
[01:29:23.255 --> 01:29:25.457]  I'm just like, leave me alone, man.
[01:29:25.457 --> 01:29:26.037]  You know what?
[01:29:26.037 --> 01:29:26.658]  I mean, come on.
[01:29:26.658 --> 01:29:27.639]  You know you just pulled me over.
[01:29:27.639 --> 01:29:28.980]  I don't have any record.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.823]  Stop acting like you're, you know, how about I go search your car?
[01:29:31.823 --> 01:29:33.984]  Because statistically, you're more criminal than anybody else.
[01:29:34.853 --> 01:29:35.153]  Okay?
[01:29:35.153 --> 01:29:35.934]  I mean, it's true.
[01:29:35.934 --> 01:29:37.014]  Look at criminology.
[01:29:37.014 --> 01:29:41.936]  There are more criminals in government and in law enforcement than any other area.
[01:29:41.936 --> 01:29:46.599]  Because smart criminals want the badge and the gun to be able to protect themselves.
[01:29:46.599 --> 01:29:48.359]  Government's who you've got to control!
[01:29:48.359 --> 01:29:50.681]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.681 --> 01:29:52.061]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.061 --> 01:29:54.582]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.582 --> 01:29:57.284]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:08.877]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles, and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[01:30:08.877 --> 01:30:13.518]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[01:30:13.518 --> 01:30:24.041]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary, broad-spectrum, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[01:30:24.321 --> 01:30:37.896]  Supernatural silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers, using a patented technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning, and yeast, in addition to many other pathogens.
[01:30:39.338 --> 01:30:39.999]  I think so.
[01:31:03.507 --> 01:31:11.632]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:15.695]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[01:32:01.062 --> 01:32:04.085]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:09.110]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:16.277]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:22.044]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:32:22.044 --> 01:32:26.069]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:32:26.069 --> 01:32:30.795]  We've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:36.021]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:32:36.261 --> 01:32:39.483]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:32:39.483 --> 01:32:42.004]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:32:42.004 --> 01:32:46.767]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:32:46.767 --> 01:32:49.648]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:32:49.648 --> 01:32:56.852]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:32:56.852 --> 01:32:58.133]  We're getting prepared.
[01:32:58.133 --> 01:32:58.793]  Are you?
[01:32:58.793 --> 01:32:59.573]  Infowarshop.com
[01:33:24.262 --> 01:33:27.383]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:33:27.383 --> 01:33:37.345]  We're going to have a special guest pop in for the next 25 minutes or so to look at how this country is on the edge of civil war and just evidences that the government can't and won't protect you.
[01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:39.726]  Why is the system gearing up for martial law?
[01:33:39.726 --> 01:33:41.406]  It's in mainstream news today.
[01:33:41.406 --> 01:33:43.647]  Why are they doing urban warfare drills?
[01:33:43.647 --> 01:33:45.007]  Why are they running checkpoints?
[01:33:45.007 --> 01:33:47.267]  Why is the military working with local police?
[01:33:47.267 --> 01:33:48.268]  What are they getting ready for?
[01:33:48.268 --> 01:33:49.028]  Well look at Europe.
[01:33:49.508 --> 01:33:57.350]  This is a designed implosion, but if the globalists don't think that you're going to go along with this, they'll back off on the implosion.
[01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:59.271]  But right now, they're going ahead with it.
[01:33:59.271 --> 01:34:10.975]  And Obama, and I'm going to play this clip coming up, is saying, I got a bunch of clips in the third hour coming up, he's saying, hey, if Congress doesn't act on the carbon taxes, which will destroy us, selectively enforced on the U.S.
[01:34:10.975 --> 01:34:14.416]  and Europe, all the jobs that are left will leave.
[01:34:14.416 --> 01:34:15.516]  If we don't do that,
[01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:20.855]  If we don't go along with that, he'll just do it by executive power.
[01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:23.016]  I mean, there's a name for that.
[01:34:23.016 --> 01:34:24.217]  It's called dictatorship.
[01:34:25.802 --> 01:34:31.004]  And even if Obama leaves office later, the office of the President is becoming a dictatorial body.
[01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:32.404]  So, that's coming up.
[01:34:32.404 --> 01:34:35.946]  Don't forget, if you believe in this radio broadcast, what we're doing, spread the word.
[01:34:35.946 --> 01:34:40.928]  If you're listening on local AM and FM stations, tell 10 people a day to tune in.
[01:34:40.928 --> 01:34:49.471]  Tell them when you're in the 7-Eleven, tell your employees, tell your boss, tell your church, print it up on cards, when the show's on, the affiliate, their website.
[01:34:50.954 --> 01:34:52.575]  That's how we're going to win this fight.
[01:34:52.575 --> 01:34:55.636]  People are more ready to wake up now than they've ever been.
[01:34:55.636 --> 01:35:03.840]  You can go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and get key videos, exclusive videos sent to you.

[01:35:16.426 --> 01:35:18.588]  We're going to send out the February issue one more time.
[01:35:18.588 --> 01:35:19.428]  We've sent it out twice.
[01:35:19.428 --> 01:35:23.551]  We're going to send it out one more time today at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:23.931]  It's free.

[01:35:31.977 --> 01:35:35.339]  Tell XM, hey, thanks for carrying the show live.
[01:35:35.339 --> 01:35:36.440]  Pick up the Sunday show.
[01:35:38.012 --> 01:35:40.315]  Get us out to more people.
[01:35:40.315 --> 01:35:41.477]  It is so important.
[01:35:41.477 --> 01:35:44.401]  People thought I was crazy 15, 16 years ago.
[01:35:44.401 --> 01:35:46.484]  They thought I was, you know, kind of nuts five years ago.
[01:35:46.484 --> 01:35:49.808]  Now people are going, whoa, everything you're talking about is coming true.
[01:35:49.808 --> 01:35:50.870]  I know.
[01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:52.812]  It's all in government white papers.
[01:35:52.812 --> 01:35:54.395]  They've already done it in other countries.
[01:35:57.748 --> 01:36:02.030]  Prepare for the worst, ladies and gentlemen, but hope for the best.
[01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:05.312]  And of course, the famous saying is, hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[01:36:05.312 --> 01:36:09.554]  This is happening because we haven't been distrustful.
[01:36:09.554 --> 01:36:11.855]  We haven't been paranoid.
[01:36:11.855 --> 01:36:12.796]  We've been overrun.
[01:36:12.796 --> 01:36:17.758]  The founders said, if you fight as hard as you can, you'll probably lose liberty.
[01:36:17.758 --> 01:36:22.341]  The founders said, you can try to protect the jewel of liberty with everything you've got, you might not be able to keep it.
[01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:23.181]  Heck, you probably can't.
[01:36:23.181 --> 01:36:24.222]  Thomas Jefferson said that.
[01:36:24.222 --> 01:36:26.163]  George Washington said that in similar words.
[01:36:26.163 --> 01:36:26.563]  Look it up.
[01:36:28.135 --> 01:36:31.298]  But they said, if you don't fight for it, you're going to get a tyranny out of control.
[01:36:31.298 --> 01:36:34.201]  They said to Thomas Jefferson in a letter, who was he writing to?
[01:36:34.201 --> 01:36:34.902]  John Adams?
[01:36:34.902 --> 01:36:36.563]  It was John Adams.
[01:36:36.563 --> 01:36:39.907]  And he said, well, what will the level be that man puts up with?
[01:36:39.907 --> 01:36:41.388]  He was marveling.
[01:36:41.388 --> 01:36:43.290]  And he said, it'll be the level you put up with.
[01:36:43.290 --> 01:36:45.632]  Whatever you accept, that's what you'll live under.
[01:36:45.632 --> 01:36:46.853]  Don't you get it, folks?
[01:36:46.853 --> 01:36:49.216]  When you bend over, wolves are coming.
[01:36:49.696 --> 01:37:01.066]  I mean, if you went out in the middle of the frozen tundra of northern Canada and played varmint tapes of dying baby rabbits, big wolves would come and they would kill you and eat you.
[01:37:01.066 --> 01:37:06.411]  But if you stood up and you had a spear, they'd run in fear.
[01:37:06.411 --> 01:37:11.956]  Government is being totally filled with criminals right now worldwide.
[01:37:13.945 --> 01:37:15.107]  We got cancer.
[01:37:15.107 --> 01:37:16.329]  We gotta cut it out.
[01:37:16.329 --> 01:37:16.550]  Okay?
[01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:17.692]  People go, don't be so negative.
[01:37:17.692 --> 01:37:18.373]  It's not negative.
[01:37:18.373 --> 01:37:20.276]  We gotta do something about this right now.
[01:37:20.276 --> 01:37:20.397]  Now.
[01:37:22.618 --> 01:37:24.759]  I want to play this clip and we're going to our guest.
[01:37:24.759 --> 01:37:37.409]  This is a new clip backing up the earlier clip that was on the local San Bernardino TV station where they say, get the fire, we're going to burn it down, burning down.
[01:37:37.409 --> 01:37:40.712]  Then we have the SWAT team actually with the tanks saying, get ready to burn it down.
[01:37:40.712 --> 01:37:48.879]  This is a third clip, CBS News, another clip where they're running around in front of reporters who they hadn't run off yet.
[01:37:48.879 --> 01:37:49.960]  This isn't even on scanners.
[01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:56.854]  Who's got those shotgun mics that go out a hundred yards with the cops going, get the gas, get the gas.
[01:37:56.854 --> 01:37:58.155]  And that's why there was fires earlier.
[01:37:58.155 --> 01:37:59.356]  They tried to burn it down earlier.
[01:37:59.356 --> 01:38:00.716]  Then they got a tank up there to do it.
[01:38:00.716 --> 01:38:06.219]  Gotta say they actually had some courage as they're trying to kill the guy to go get the gasoline up there themselves.
[01:38:06.219 --> 01:38:09.561]  So here is the CBS clip.
[01:38:09.561 --> 01:38:10.582]  I mean, it's open and shut.
[01:38:10.582 --> 01:38:11.442]  They burned this thing down.
[01:38:11.442 --> 01:38:12.563]  This is three clips now.
[01:38:12.563 --> 01:38:12.863]  Here it is.
[01:38:16.483 --> 01:38:20.185]  All right, again, we apologize for the expletives.
[01:38:20.185 --> 01:38:28.767]  This is live coverage, a gun battle, we believe, with Christopher Dorner going on right now in Big Bear.
[01:38:49.235 --> 01:38:55.320]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, the media last night and this morning was calling it a conspiracy theory.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.521]  Just said that they burned it down.
[01:38:56.521 --> 01:38:59.343]  Now CNN is asking, what does the audio mean?
[01:38:59.343 --> 01:39:03.486]  So, we forced the dinosaur media again to cover something.
[01:39:03.486 --> 01:39:07.229]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to get him on last week, but he was too busy to join us.
[01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:09.731]  We're thankful that he's here with us today.
[01:39:09.731 --> 01:39:13.454]  He does happen to be a sponsor, but that's not why he's on the air with us.
[01:39:15.536 --> 01:39:34.534]  I saw articles where they're not letting people rebuild, they're raising property taxes from Hurricane Sandy, and now with the Nemo storm, people are still without power and government is trying to harass them and using it as a power grab, and how it ties into the Greek food brawl
[01:39:35.254 --> 01:39:40.237]  That we're now seeing with hundreds and hundreds trying to battle to get radishes and things that fell off a truck.
[01:39:40.237 --> 01:39:41.738]  Shades of Argentina.
[01:39:41.738 --> 01:39:43.819]  And why is the government gearing up for that here?
[01:39:43.819 --> 01:39:47.341]  I have some articles breaking down all of that today.
[01:39:47.341 --> 01:39:55.445]  And I wanted to get Steve Shank on to the end of the hour that I promise we're going right to Mike, Bobby, Jason, Carl, and others.
[01:39:55.445 --> 01:39:57.646]  And I want to hear from police on their take of what's happened.
[01:39:57.646 --> 01:39:58.727]  But first, before we talk about
[01:39:59.247 --> 01:40:08.394]  Geopolitically, what's going on with Steve Schenck is a philosopher, educator, noted food expert, and 30-plus year, I mean, the father of modern storable foods.
[01:40:08.394 --> 01:40:10.095]  Everybody else claims they're him.
[01:40:10.095 --> 01:40:11.016]  He's the real deal.
[01:40:11.016 --> 01:40:12.657]  Everybody says that about their sponsor.
[01:40:12.657 --> 01:40:13.337]  Go check it out.
[01:40:13.337 --> 01:40:14.498]  They are the real deal.
[01:40:14.498 --> 01:40:21.103]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex to find their free food deal where you can get some samples and things and a food planning kit for free.
[01:40:21.103 --> 01:40:24.626]  Steve's book, It's Not Your Fault, delves into his philosophies a lot.
[01:40:25.146 --> 01:40:32.471]  And it goes on, and Steve Schenck joins us here today.
[01:40:32.471 --> 01:40:42.457]  Steve, what is your take on Chris Dorner and the police shooting up innocent people's cars that didn't even match it, and just government going crazy, but the public going crazy, too?
[01:40:42.457 --> 01:40:51.143]  I mean, it's like half the people on YouTube, and I'm getting threats over this, going, hey, kill the Pigs family, kill, kill, kill, kill Alex.
[01:40:51.143 --> 01:40:52.384]  He doesn't want to kill the Pigs.
[01:40:52.904 --> 01:40:56.505]  I mean, the cops are turning into demons, the people are turning into demons.
[01:40:56.505 --> 01:40:57.946]  This is like Sodom and Gomorrah.
[01:40:57.946 --> 01:41:00.167]  What's going on here?
[01:41:00.167 --> 01:41:05.969]  Well, very simply, we've talked about it and talked about it for years together, Alex.
[01:41:05.969 --> 01:41:14.593]  And the fact is, is that when people function from a position of fear, you cannot predict their behavior.
[01:41:14.593 --> 01:41:19.775]  You have mob psychology, which, very simply, is not sane.
[01:41:20.902 --> 01:41:22.243]  What has to happen?
[01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:40.601]  Now, you know, you talk all the time about people listening, people getting the information, people getting familiar with what's going on, and there's one step further that they have to take, but unfortunately you and I can't get them to do it on our own.
[01:41:40.601 --> 01:41:42.562]  We can't fix anybody.
[01:41:42.562 --> 01:41:43.744]  Here's the law.
[01:41:44.484 --> 01:41:51.971]  For evil men to win, all it takes is for good men to do nothing.
[01:41:51.971 --> 01:41:59.577]  Having said that, it doesn't do any good to have all of this information that you and I have been disseminating for years.
[01:42:00.758 --> 01:42:01.379]  I don't
[01:42:17.296 --> 01:42:35.671]  When you talked about looking in the mirror every morning and say, if it is to be, it's up to me, and if every individual, every American took responsibility for becoming independent, then the country would take care of itself.
[01:42:35.671 --> 01:42:44.478]  If our people are not dependent, if they have enough food, even if they don't have some place to stay,
[01:42:45.439 --> 01:42:52.101]  They can't be in a situation where they have to be dependent like the Greeks.
[01:42:52.101 --> 01:42:57.543]  Those people would not be rioting if every one of them had a year's supply of food for their family in their homes.
[01:42:57.543 --> 01:43:10.007]  They could stay in their homes and the only ones that would be rioting out there are the ones that are dependent and have to go and say, please somebody else take care of me.
[01:43:10.007 --> 01:43:13.788]  The victims are the only ones that are out there having problems.
[01:43:14.827 --> 01:43:24.617]  You know, one of the principles that you and I have talked about several times is if you're prepared, you can turn a disaster into an adventure.
[01:43:24.617 --> 01:43:30.263]  Now, I'm not saying that this thing with Dormer out there is a potential adventure.
[01:43:31.454 --> 01:43:43.661]  But the mob psychology, the fear and the anxiety, and the running hither and yon, just decided to do something, shows lack of planning, lack of preparedness.
[01:43:43.661 --> 01:43:53.887]  There are going to be nuts out there, whether it's a cop killer like this, or some idiot that walks into a theater and starts shooting people.
[01:43:53.887 --> 01:43:57.849]  Some of the folks are getting the message that the best protection from crime and
[01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:09.560]  And other oppressive type of things that we need to be fearful about is for each individual to be prepared to protect themselves.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.223]  You can't depend on the police to protect you.
[01:44:12.223 --> 01:44:14.986]  Well Steve, when you came to town a few months ago, incredibly
[01:44:15.206 --> 01:44:15.847]  We're good to go.
[01:44:41.485 --> 01:44:45.407]  Where they're throwing the book at people that have lost their houses from Sandy.
[01:44:45.407 --> 01:44:49.748]  The government has finally gone over the edge and become a bunch of paranoid and lunatics.
[01:44:49.748 --> 01:44:51.989]  It's not like that in every area of the country.
[01:44:51.989 --> 01:44:56.711]  And Obama is now saying, if Congress won't shut down all the power plants, I'm going to do it.
[01:44:56.711 --> 01:44:58.432]  I'm going to bring in a carbon tax.
[01:44:58.432 --> 01:45:01.853]  It's openly testing to see if he can become a dictator.
[01:45:02.333 --> 01:45:05.755]  I mean, now is the time to get prepared, and we're just being proven right on this.
[01:45:05.755 --> 01:45:10.417]  The last thing they want is for us to be prepared, so we better get prepared.
[01:45:10.417 --> 01:45:13.859]  I mean, we get made fun of for being prepared, but look at the government.
[01:45:13.859 --> 01:45:16.180]  They're digging in like it's the end of the world.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:19.141]  Well, here's the law, Alex.
[01:45:19.141 --> 01:45:25.124]  You know it, I know it, and everyone out there that thinks about it has to know this.
[01:45:25.124 --> 01:45:30.527]  The extent to which you as an individual are dependent
[01:45:31.770 --> 01:45:43.355]  is the extent to which you have become a victim of your own choice and given power over yourself to that on which you depend.
[01:45:43.355 --> 01:45:47.177]  If you look in your cupboard or wherever you store your food
[01:45:48.417 --> 01:46:01.515]  And you don't see enough food to feed your family for six months, a year, however long you think it's going to take for us to recover from a total shutdown which is being threatened.
[01:46:02.432 --> 01:46:11.997]  If you look at that, you can't blame anybody but yourself if you end up like the Greeks out there having to riot to be fed.
[01:46:11.997 --> 01:46:21.861]  If you're spending your time rioting just to get food or out there begging or standing in bread lines, how effective can you be to be
[01:46:23.862 --> 01:46:28.586]  One of the good men who can do something.
[01:46:28.586 --> 01:46:39.214]  Exactly, and the IMF World Bank 112 point plan that got leaked in 2002 that we covered in our big article yesterday, how the globalists want riots and civil war worldwide, not just here, they say
[01:46:39.614 --> 01:46:42.056]  We shut things down, then people riot.
[01:46:42.056 --> 01:46:43.337]  Then that destroys confidence.
[01:46:43.337 --> 01:46:45.098]  We use that to buy everything up.
[01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:46.399]  Then they riot again.
[01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:48.760]  They want a shutdown society.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.722]  That's what UN Agenda 21 is.
[01:46:51.722 --> 01:46:53.523]  It's what we've got to buy local.
[01:46:53.523 --> 01:46:54.484]  We've got to have gardens.
[01:46:54.484 --> 01:46:55.785]  We've got to have storable foods.
[01:46:55.785 --> 01:46:56.986]  We've got to have guns.
[01:46:56.986 --> 01:46:58.647]  We've got to have our neighbors awake.
[01:46:58.647 --> 01:47:00.908]  We've got to control our counties and our cities.
[01:47:00.908 --> 01:47:01.889]  This is the battle.
[01:47:01.889 --> 01:47:02.669]  This is it.
[01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:06.492]  And we need all the bureaucrats to realize you're on our team whether you like it or not.
[01:47:06.492 --> 01:47:07.933]  You're not part of the New World Order.
[01:47:08.919 --> 01:47:25.938]  You see, what has to happen is if each individual or each family decides, okay, I am going to take care of me, there is nothing you can do to control what is said on the State of the Union Address.
[01:47:26.599 --> 01:47:32.746]  You can do nothing as individuals to go out and try and change.
[01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:35.268]  My daddy used to say an interesting thing.
[01:47:35.268 --> 01:47:43.257]  He says, it's more difficult to change one stubborn man's mind than to change the Congress of the United States.
[01:47:44.338 --> 01:47:46.601]  Well, let's take that further.
[01:47:46.601 --> 01:47:58.918]  If our people stop being stubborn and stop choosing to be dependent and say, hey, feed me, feed the pigs, feed the pigs, remember the story about the wild hogs and how you can capture them.
[01:47:58.918 --> 01:47:59.559]  The fact is...
[01:48:00.882 --> 01:48:12.953]  That if we stubbornly refuse to be dependent, as opposed to stubbornly... Look at all the Hollywood movies the last 70 years making fun of the old timers that wouldn't take anything off anybody.
[01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:14.835]  They're the people that built this country.
[01:48:14.835 --> 01:48:15.736]  They weren't stupid.
[01:48:15.736 --> 01:48:16.937]  They weren't backwards.
[01:48:16.937 --> 01:48:18.639]  They weren't naive.
[01:48:19.687 --> 01:48:38.592]  That's right, and the fact is that if you look in your cupboards, and you don't have food there, and if something shuts down, if these power plants go down and the grid gets messed up, or whatever happens, and we know that something probably will happen,
[01:48:39.403 --> 01:48:42.990]  They've got troops doing drills in every city with the police.
[01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:47.860]  I have the articles with links to video with people holding signs up saying I need food.
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:48.742]  And they're Americans.
[01:48:48.742 --> 01:48:50.025]  I mean, what are they getting ready for?
[01:48:51.465 --> 01:48:55.648]  I don't know, but I guess maybe we can kind of guess.
[01:48:55.648 --> 01:49:03.214]  The fact is that if each individual... Let's take a country that has everyone independent.
[01:49:03.214 --> 01:49:06.136]  Everyone can feed themselves for a year.
[01:49:06.136 --> 01:49:10.520]  Everyone has guns if they feel like they need them.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:12.982]  You mean the old, you mean the old, freer America?
[01:49:13.632 --> 01:49:18.616]  The old, freer America, where every individual takes care of themselves.
[01:49:18.616 --> 01:49:24.540]  What is the opportunity, what is the chance of anybody coming in and politically taking over?
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:31.365]  Unless you can get a bunch of people to vote for you to take care of them that choose to be dependent on you, then you have total control.
[01:49:31.365 --> 01:49:37.870]  The extent to which we're dependent is the extent to which we give power over ourselves to that on which we depend.
[01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:54.101]  You see, in any of these situations where we had shootings, out here in Utah, one of the organizations provided a free class to teachers for concealed weapon permits.
[01:49:54.101 --> 01:50:03.507]  They had 400 teachers come in and get their permits to carry concealed.
[01:50:03.507 --> 01:50:06.790]  These ghouls go to the schools because they know it's where they won't be resisted.
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.882]  It's a gun-free zone.
[01:50:09.882 --> 01:50:12.063]  It's a free kill zone.
[01:50:12.063 --> 01:50:20.329]  Every place that disallows the citizens to do what Jefferson suggested that we do.
[01:50:20.329 --> 01:50:21.329]  Remember what he said?
[01:50:21.329 --> 01:50:23.551]  The great object is that every man be armed.
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:28.706]  Absolutely, and why is that?
[01:50:28.706 --> 01:50:33.812]  When you have the government fearing the people, you have liberty.
[01:50:33.812 --> 01:50:37.937]  When you have the people fearing the government, you have tyranny.
[01:50:37.937 --> 01:50:41.001]  Jefferson also said wherever firearms are, they restrain evil.
[01:50:42.057 --> 01:50:42.997]  There you go.
[01:50:42.997 --> 01:50:46.298]  But you see, everybody, you know, even the conversations.
[01:50:46.298 --> 01:50:50.999]  I watched Jay Leno a few nights ago where he had a guest on there.
[01:50:50.999 --> 01:50:55.220]  I just watched it very briefly and it was when some of the testimony was given before the show.
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:55.480]  Stay there.
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.860]  I want to hear this about Jay Leno.
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:58.260]  Steve Schenck, always informative.
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:00.241]  I got him on about food prices going up.
[01:51:00.241 --> 01:51:01.581]  We'll get some brief news on that too.
[01:51:01.581 --> 01:51:03.501]  Introducing Pro-Wine.
[01:51:03.501 --> 01:51:05.742]  All of your filtration in one system.
[01:51:05.742 --> 01:51:06.862]  Portable, on the go.
[01:51:07.142 --> 01:51:11.705]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[01:51:11.705 --> 01:51:17.788]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:51:17.788 --> 01:51:28.795]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[01:51:28.795 --> 01:51:31.657]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates.

[01:51:35.259 --> 01:51:52.586]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:52:02.605 --> 01:52:04.826]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:52:04.826 --> 01:52:09.908]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:52:09.908 --> 01:52:11.709]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:16.991]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.
[01:52:16.991 --> 01:52:24.175]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:52:25.015 --> 01:52:27.817]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:52:27.817 --> 01:52:31.600]  It may be because the liberals in the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:40.147]  That's why my friend just created a free video at WeirdDevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:52:40.147 --> 01:52:50.296]  Go watch the shocking video at WeirdDevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[01:52:51.036 --> 01:52:56.359]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to WeirdDevice.com before it's gone forever.
[01:52:56.359 --> 01:53:00.622]  Again, that's WeirdDevice.com.
[01:53:00.622 --> 01:53:02.383]  Lunch is ready!
[01:53:02.383 --> 01:53:05.985]  And it's an MRE smorgasbord at LongLifeFood.com.
[01:53:05.985 --> 01:53:13.229]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public, and we're still selling them almost 30 years later.
[01:53:13.229 --> 01:53:19.273]  Today, Long Life Food Depot has the world's most complete MRE online buffet, because MREs are all we do.
[01:53:19.273 --> 01:53:20.634]  Tasty varieties of chicken,

[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:34.521]  And so are the graduated quantity discounts.
[01:53:34.521 --> 01:53:36.642]  The more you buy, the more you save.

[01:53:54.078 --> 01:53:56.702]  Longlifefood.com since 1983.
[01:53:56.702 --> 01:53:58.565]  Sending real food to your real future.
[01:54:09.178 --> 01:54:15.168]  Look at your women crying.
[01:54:15.168 --> 01:54:17.633]  Look at your young men dying.
[01:54:18.882 --> 01:54:22.383]  Alright, I'm going to keep Steve with us in that little segment.
[01:54:22.383 --> 01:54:27.105]  Five minutes to the next hour, then I'm going directly to your calls, everybody that's patiently holding right now.
[01:54:27.105 --> 01:54:29.526]  Going to be a jam-packed third hour.
[01:54:29.526 --> 01:54:36.268]  Can you believe they burned that thing down in front of everybody and have been caught on all these different tapes and scanners saying it?
[01:54:36.268 --> 01:54:45.051]  And it is just amazing how undisciplined, even if they were going to burn that guy up because they were scared to go in and try to take him out or arrest him.
[01:54:45.051 --> 01:54:48.012]  That's a whole other can of worms right there.
[01:54:48.996 --> 01:54:55.081]  In the old days, if somebody was so dangerous and already killed a bunch of people, it's just not dead or alive, dead.
[01:54:55.081 --> 01:54:56.823]  Just kill them.
[01:54:56.823 --> 01:55:07.352]  But then, the government's so corrupt, it's not like it's some outlaw who's been known and seen at ten saloons killing people, and everybody knows, you know, Red Bart or whatever.
[01:55:07.352 --> 01:55:15.419]  It's just, we're told this is the guy, and that's the official story, and I've got articles coming up where all over the news, they keep saying they found his passport and driver's license here and there.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:24.748]  It's all pretty weird, but it's a big, big, big PR problem for the establishment and Obama, so I don't see him staging it.
[01:55:24.748 --> 01:55:27.831]  I mean, why would you stage something if it didn't help you?
[01:55:27.831 --> 01:55:34.177]  Going back to Steve Schenck, you know, he's not here to plug stuff, but I thought I'd plug efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:55:34.177 --> 01:55:39.342]  You can find their CD, audio, breakdown of efoods direct forward.
[01:55:40.483 --> 01:55:47.770]  You can get a free six meals to test it out and see how you like it, just a sampling.
[01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:53.195]  And then it's got the meal planning kit in there to get you to think about it very professionally done.
[01:55:53.195 --> 01:55:57.039]  And that's available at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex and some other discounts or 800-409-5633.
[01:55:57.039 --> 01:55:58.340]  And not only is it where I get my storable food,
[01:56:02.344 --> 01:56:06.186]  But it's also just a great company and a great sponsor, so it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:56:06.186 --> 01:56:11.870]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:14.972]  Steve, we were getting into a bunch of issues.
[01:56:14.972 --> 01:56:20.115]  Europe was in less debt per capita than we are, and they've got riots all over.
[01:56:20.115 --> 01:56:24.158]  Two years into this, you know, people homeless, more and more homeless here.
[01:56:25.158 --> 01:56:28.182]  I mean, it really is smart for people to get storable foods.
[01:56:28.182 --> 01:56:29.885]  And I guess that's the final equation.
[01:56:29.885 --> 01:56:31.106]  Food is key.
[01:56:31.106 --> 01:56:31.827]  So is water.
[01:56:31.827 --> 01:56:33.530]  So are firearms.
[01:56:33.530 --> 01:56:35.532]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:56:35.532 --> 01:56:40.819]  But other little tidbits and points you'd like to add about what we're seeing unfold?
[01:56:42.056 --> 01:56:45.697]  Well, just very, very quickly.
[01:56:45.697 --> 01:56:55.862]  They were talking about this testimony before the Senate subcommittees and talking about how people need to protect their homes and all that.
[01:56:55.862 --> 01:56:58.743]  The message that people are afraid to announce
[01:56:59.503 --> 01:57:07.874]  Is the reason for the Second Amendment is not hunting, not for us to protect ourselves from other Americans.
[01:57:07.874 --> 01:57:16.805]  Very simply, we had come from countries as immigrants that established this country where the government always
[01:57:17.886 --> 01:57:21.670]  Overpowered the population with armament.
[01:57:21.670 --> 01:57:33.120]  And they determined that for this people to stay free, they had to maintain enough power in the hands of the people so that the government couldn't overpower them with armament.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.061]  That's why the Second Amendment is there.
[01:57:35.922 --> 01:57:36.843]  Nobody wants to say it.
[01:57:36.843 --> 01:57:40.225]  They want to sugarcoat it by saying, well, we need this for hunting.
[01:57:40.225 --> 01:57:42.486]  Well, you don't need more than five rounds for hunting.
[01:57:42.486 --> 01:57:45.188]  And why do we need these assault rifles?
[01:57:45.188 --> 01:57:51.212]  And exactly what the founders said, a tyrannical government arming to the teeth while saying, turn your guns in.
[01:57:51.212 --> 01:57:52.233]  We just want to be friends.
[01:57:53.254 --> 01:57:54.435]  There you go.
[01:57:54.435 --> 01:57:55.135]  Enough of that.
[01:57:55.135 --> 01:57:59.097]  We've got to talk about an interesting thing.
[01:57:59.097 --> 01:58:14.966]  The people, at this point, what we're trying to do, Alex, is tell everybody very simply, like you've been telling them for years, if you are not independent, if you don't have your own bread, you will end up standing in a bread line.
[01:58:14.966 --> 01:58:17.487]  You do not want to be exposed to that.
[01:58:17.487 --> 01:58:21.990]  What we're doing, you announced some contact information for us.
[01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:34.180]  What we've done is we've put together a bunch of packages where people literally can supply themselves and there's enough free stuff that goes along with it so they can supply their friends and relatives and that type of thing.
[01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:35.181]  Well let's talk about that.
[01:58:35.181 --> 01:58:36.062]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:36.062 --> 01:58:42.107]  Back in 60 seconds and then the whole next hour your phone calls.
[01:58:42.107 --> 01:58:45.811]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.811 --> 01:58:47.833]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.929 --> 01:58:55.330]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:58:55.330 --> 01:59:01.373]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:59:01.373 --> 01:59:05.255]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[01:59:56.847 --> 01:59:59.610]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.226 --> 02:00:11.069]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.069 --> 02:00:12.649]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:14.190]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.190 --> 02:00:18.392]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.392 --> 02:00:22.695]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.695 --> 02:00:26.176]  Alright, just five minutes left with Steve Schenke.
[02:00:26.176 --> 02:00:28.418]  BeepersDirect.com forward slash Alex to get that.
[02:00:29.588 --> 02:00:33.291]  Food planner and free six meals to test out their great products.
[02:00:33.291 --> 02:00:35.653]  Great sponsor, but it's about getting you prepared as well.
[02:00:35.653 --> 02:00:37.295]  It's a win-win.
[02:00:37.295 --> 02:00:40.438]  Finishing up, and then we're going to come back with phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:00:40.438 --> 02:00:44.561]  I know Bobby, Mike, and others have been holding a while.
[02:00:44.561 --> 02:00:47.624]  We'll go right to your calls when we start the next segment.
[02:00:47.624 --> 02:00:51.648]  Chef Max says he was visited by the FBI and DHS that I was brought up.
[02:00:51.648 --> 02:00:52.749]  We'll see what happened with that.
[02:00:53.029 --> 02:00:55.151]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:55.151 --> 02:00:57.414]  Your call is straight ahead.
[02:00:57.414 --> 02:01:02.639]  But Steve, what was the point about some of the new offers you've got at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex?
[02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:17.857]  It's just simply the fact that the one thing that people must realize is if each family, each individual takes care of themselves, then the country will take care of itself.
[02:01:17.857 --> 02:01:23.981]  If you are independent and never have to go and riot and go and beg,
[02:01:24.801 --> 02:01:24.881]  And
[02:01:46.107 --> 02:01:55.418]  If people, if good men don't act, and the way you act is you can't go out and change what's happening out there, but you can control what you do.
[02:01:55.418 --> 02:02:03.849]  The way you act is become independent so you can live to influence, to help, to support, to work another day.
[02:02:04.389 --> 02:02:12.398]  If we stop shopping with Globalist, if we start shopping locally, if we wake people up, if we get prepared, that will wreck the New World Order.
[02:02:12.398 --> 02:02:12.979]  It's that simple.
[02:02:12.979 --> 02:02:17.124]  Now tell me about the new Patriot Pack that you've got at efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:02:19.226 --> 02:02:27.729]  It's just a wonderful piece of equipment that has the stove and everything in it and also 72 servings of food.
[02:02:27.729 --> 02:02:31.310]  But that comes free with every $400 worth of food.
[02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:47.275]  Oddly enough, if an individual orders in a one-year supply of the best food on the planet, they get up to 20 of these things that go along with it that they can share with their family or that they can use for themselves that are just great grab-and-go with 72 servings in it.
[02:02:49.636 --> 02:02:53.999]  And I'm actually on the side at 76 and the Free Stove and some other stuff.
[02:02:53.999 --> 02:02:55.881]  These are great boogie packs.
[02:02:55.881 --> 02:03:01.024]  Infowars.com has links over to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:03:01.024 --> 02:03:03.346]  And again, when you go there, that's where all the specials are.
[02:03:03.346 --> 02:03:04.106]  Give them a call 800-409-5633.
[02:03:04.106 --> 02:03:04.406]  800-409-5633.
[02:03:04.406 --> 02:03:12.111]  We're seeing massive increases in inflation all over the world.
[02:03:12.111 --> 02:03:14.073]  I've got a stack of that in my news today.
[02:03:14.073 --> 02:03:15.714]  You've been predicting this for about four or five years.
[02:03:15.714 --> 02:03:17.855]  We've seen food prices go up 50% on average.
[02:03:19.316 --> 02:03:20.857]  What's happening now?
[02:03:20.857 --> 02:03:23.980]  The only hope that people have is to do two things.
[02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:34.148]  First of all, by getting their food supply in, they freeze the price at today's prices so it won't go up to the point where it will price them out of the market.
[02:03:34.148 --> 02:03:39.392]  Right now, 20,000 families or individuals a day are dropping below the poverty level.
[02:03:39.392 --> 02:03:42.314]  That means they don't have enough to buy their own food, let alone extra.
[02:03:42.874 --> 02:03:50.436]  The other thing is, by freezing the cost and acquiring the food, you also freeze the availability.
[02:03:50.436 --> 02:03:53.197]  Why do you think that this food is going up so much?
[02:03:53.197 --> 02:03:58.378]  We have, we're in the last year, a seven-year famine worldwide.
[02:03:58.378 --> 02:04:00.918]  Food prices, food is short.
[02:04:00.918 --> 02:04:02.739]  We had a terrible crop this last year.
[02:04:02.739 --> 02:04:05.400]  We're going to have another terrible one this coming year.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:11.021]  What's happening is those food prices are going to price themselves out of the market, but the availability
[02:04:11.741 --> 02:04:25.474]  For even people that have plenty of cash set aside or gold set aside, literally at some point in time out here in Utah they talk about at some point in time we won't be able to buy a loaf of bread with a bushel of gold.
[02:04:25.474 --> 02:04:26.515]  We're getting there!
[02:04:27.634 --> 02:04:30.337]  It just, you have to see the handwriting on the wall.
[02:04:30.337 --> 02:04:33.701]  I hope things turn around politically and people can, you know, get Congress to try to impeach.
[02:04:33.701 --> 02:04:36.243]  There are things we can do, but number one is get prepared.
[02:04:36.243 --> 02:04:37.825]  800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:04:37.825 --> 02:04:38.746]  Thank you, Steve Schenck.
[02:04:41.943 --> 02:04:42.604]  Thank you.
[02:04:42.604 --> 02:04:43.565]  There goes Steve.
[02:04:43.565 --> 02:04:47.289]  By the way, I'm on InfoWars.com in police audio from Donner Siege.
[02:04:47.289 --> 02:04:49.291]  Burn this mother down.
[02:04:49.291 --> 02:04:52.334]  There are people in there going, hey, the burners are talking about tear gas.
[02:04:52.334 --> 02:04:53.355]  They didn't burn him out.
[02:04:53.355 --> 02:04:56.738]  They're on tape saying burn the house down over and over again.
[02:04:56.738 --> 02:04:58.480]  Now two separate feeds.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.942]  You people will never wake up.
[02:05:01.488 --> 02:05:03.389]  Introducing Pro-1.

[02:05:07.031 --> 02:05:11.553]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:05:11.553 --> 02:05:17.696]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilic acid.
[02:05:17.696 --> 02:05:28.461]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:05:28.681 --> 02:05:35.168]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:05:35.168 --> 02:05:49.903]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:05:50.103 --> 02:05:52.467]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:06:05.635 --> 02:06:06.896]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:06.896 --> 02:06:10.779]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:10.779 --> 02:06:13.060]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:18.924]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:18.924 --> 02:06:25.608]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:25.608 --> 02:06:31.572]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:31.572 --> 02:06:35.235]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:06:35.755 --> 02:06:40.038]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:40.038 --> 02:06:45.982]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.982 --> 02:06:49.544]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:49.544 --> 02:06:51.525]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:51.525 --> 02:06:52.646]  It's here.

[02:07:01.311 --> 02:07:06.775]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it through the year.
[02:07:06.775 --> 02:07:16.062]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy, our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:07:16.062 --> 02:07:22.286]  My friends at eFoods Direct hear from customers every day that are fortunate to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:07:22.506 --> 02:07:26.550]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said, Bottom line?
[02:07:26.550 --> 02:07:29.472]  It's better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.

[02:07:54.671 --> 02:07:56.132]  Get self-sufficient today.
[02:07:56.132 --> 02:07:57.853]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:08:07.110 --> 02:08:12.639]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:12.639 --> 02:08:19.430]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:21.313]  Time keeps on slipping into the future.
[02:08:23.928 --> 02:08:32.433]  Alright, I haven't even gotten into the State of the Union yet, where Obama says, if Congress doesn't do what I want, I'll just do it with executive power, on carbon taxes, you name it, that's all coming up.
[02:08:32.433 --> 02:08:41.319]  There's now four clips, actually, different clips, of official scanners and news, with police saying, we're gonna burn that house down, get the gas.
[02:08:41.319 --> 02:08:44.761]  And people are spinning it on CNN, going, they meant tear gas.
[02:08:44.761 --> 02:08:47.702]  Just like Waco, right, where they set the fires and said tear gas did it?
[02:08:47.702 --> 02:08:47.882]  I mean...
[02:08:48.982 --> 02:08:50.523]  I predicted they'd burn it down.
[02:08:50.523 --> 02:08:51.904]  I mean, just don't be so naive.
[02:08:51.904 --> 02:08:54.467]  It's a religion of being naive.
[02:08:54.467 --> 02:08:56.028]  I'm going to get into that, everything.
[02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:57.749]  Now let's go through your calls quickly here.
[02:08:57.749 --> 02:09:02.713]  I want to get to everybody, at least five or six of these callers that are on hold in this segment.
[02:09:02.713 --> 02:09:05.396]  Bobby and Michael and Mike and Carl and Chef Max.
[02:09:05.396 --> 02:09:06.516]  I want to hear what he has to say.
[02:09:06.516 --> 02:09:09.059]  I can't wait to hear this.
[02:09:09.059 --> 02:09:11.380]  But right now, let's go to Bobby in California.
[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:12.882]  You want to talk about the State of the Union.
[02:09:12.882 --> 02:09:13.522]  What'd you think of that?
[02:09:13.522 --> 02:09:17.205]  Yeah, Obama opened it.
[02:09:17.205 --> 02:09:17.886]  Oh, what'd he say right now?
[02:09:19.219 --> 02:09:20.021]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:09:20.021 --> 02:09:22.065]  What's your take on that?
[02:09:22.065 --> 02:09:30.041]  Obama openly announced that he bypassed Congress and signed an executive order that enforces Homeland Security's role as all-powerful king in charge of cybersecurity.
[02:09:30.041 --> 02:09:30.942]  Did you see that yesterday?
[02:09:32.236 --> 02:09:42.003]  Yes, he said he will bypass Congress, as we predicted, and have a cyber security bill that even CNET News says is Chinese-style or Russian-style censorship.
[02:09:42.003 --> 02:09:45.766]  And he won't even let Congress see the cyber order he already did that already did it.
[02:09:45.766 --> 02:09:47.427]  Warrantless wiretapping, you name it.
[02:09:47.427 --> 02:09:49.889]  And he said he'll bypass them on carbon taxes.
[02:09:49.889 --> 02:09:51.230]  He said he'll do everything.
[02:09:51.230 --> 02:09:52.471]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:09:52.471 --> 02:09:53.872]  It's happening.
[02:09:53.872 --> 02:09:56.014]  And the government is preparing for war with us.
[02:09:56.014 --> 02:09:57.775]  They want a civil war.
[02:09:57.775 --> 02:09:58.556]  They're crazy.
[02:10:00.603 --> 02:10:09.089]  You don't have to worry, because Obama appointed Homeland Security's Civil Liberties Division to oversee Homeland Security to make sure they don't abuse their power.
[02:10:09.089 --> 02:10:09.569]  Well, that's right.
[02:10:09.569 --> 02:10:15.473]  To get around states' rights, they create a 10-member governor board he appoints, who says, it's alright to run over the states.
[02:10:15.473 --> 02:10:17.475]  The governors you appointed said it was okay.
[02:10:17.475 --> 02:10:21.418]  To take over all the rural areas under the Pentagon, we have a Rural Affairs Commission.
[02:10:21.418 --> 02:10:24.279]  See, we don't need the Bill of Rights, Constitution, or courts anymore.
[02:10:24.279 --> 02:10:29.103]  We have these new things that Lenin, I mean, excuse me, Obama has created.
[02:10:31.025 --> 02:10:31.925]  Yeah.
[02:10:31.925 --> 02:10:43.829]  On the quick thing on the Donner thing, on the frenzy yesterday, I remember thinking just like if somebody wanted to take out your whole family, all they'd have to do is just make a nominous phone call to the LAPD and say that they saw Donner go in your house.
[02:10:43.829 --> 02:10:56.272]  And you know, they'd come out... And it wouldn't even be news, or they could kill people, blame it on you, have you dead in a house, burn it down two weeks later, and say, and again, I don't think that's what happened, but that's the problem with burning down houses with people.
[02:10:56.952 --> 02:11:00.796]  Is, you know, his charred body, supposedly, and they're very suspicious.
[02:11:00.796 --> 02:11:02.877]  Oh, I have two articles I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:11:02.877 --> 02:11:03.438]  Let me show these.
[02:11:03.438 --> 02:11:04.158]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:11:04.158 --> 02:11:06.941]  If you're a TV viewer, check these out.
[02:11:06.941 --> 02:11:08.883]  Radio listeners, go check them out for yourself as well.
[02:11:10.322 --> 02:11:31.240]  Uh, Dorner, Manhunt, ex-cop may have had help, court records show, LA Times, and then in the article it says after authorities, not servants, authorities interviewed the boat captain early Thursday, they found Dorner's wallet and vacation cards at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, if I'm saying that right, near the U.S.-Mexico-Ysidro.
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:37.305]  The same day a guard at the Point Loma Naval Base told authorities he had spotted a man matching Dorner's
[02:11:37.825 --> 02:11:41.992]  Description trying to sneak onto the base according to court records.
[02:11:41.992 --> 02:11:42.172]  I mean
[02:11:43.291 --> 02:11:49.774]  Folks, you can have false alarms, but I mean, this is like 9-11 where they found multiple passports in the rubble that day that survived it.
[02:11:49.774 --> 02:11:51.975]  I mean, it turned out it was made up.
[02:11:51.975 --> 02:11:53.216]  I mean, this is really bizarre.
[02:11:53.216 --> 02:11:56.037]  I don't want to say this wasn't staged.
[02:11:56.037 --> 02:11:59.099]  I mean, it looks like it was real because it puts egg on their face.
[02:11:59.099 --> 02:12:00.900]  It's something they'd want to stage.
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:03.561]  It's a PR black eye, a disaster.
[02:12:03.561 --> 02:12:08.224]  But at the same time, here's the other article.
[02:12:08.224 --> 02:12:11.425]  Dorner's wallet found in burned out cabin with his driver's license.
[02:12:11.425 --> 02:12:12.426]  That's USA Today.
[02:12:14.966 --> 02:12:17.487]  This is getting so ridiculous.
[02:12:17.487 --> 02:12:21.348]  And they didn't know if he had hostages in that house, in that cabin.
[02:12:21.348 --> 02:12:24.228]  He'd had them at the other house he'd been at earlier in the day, a few miles away.
[02:12:24.228 --> 02:12:26.629]  Or was it 20 miles away?
[02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:29.089]  I mean, who knows?
[02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:30.930]  They're such lying.
[02:12:30.930 --> 02:12:32.770]  But they say they didn't burn it down.
[02:12:32.770 --> 02:12:34.650]  Yes, an accidental fire.
[02:12:34.650 --> 02:12:36.031]  Dorner probably started it.
[02:12:36.031 --> 02:12:37.911]  That's known on CNN, as we predicted.
[02:12:37.911 --> 02:12:41.472]  I predict that they burned down his cabin.
[02:12:41.472 --> 02:12:42.432]  It's like predicting that
[02:12:43.595 --> 02:12:49.938]  Grizzly bears have brown fur, or the moon orbits the planet, or the sun comes up in the morning.
[02:12:49.938 --> 02:12:50.978]  I mean, this is not hard.
[02:12:50.978 --> 02:12:51.959]  Okay, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:12:51.959 --> 02:12:53.039]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:12:53.039 --> 02:12:57.401]  Mike in Tennessee, former military and police, wants to give his take on this.
[02:12:57.401 --> 02:13:01.083]  Mike, should we just have everybody in Southern California line up and be shot?
[02:13:01.083 --> 02:13:04.304]  That way the police are safe?
[02:13:04.304 --> 02:13:06.165]  It looks like it's that way, doesn't it?
[02:13:06.165 --> 02:13:08.586]  Unfortunately, I can't say that's too far from the truth, is it?
[02:13:10.539 --> 02:13:14.861]  Um, the behavior of these guys is actually, uh, becoming nationwide.
[02:13:14.861 --> 02:13:24.704]  Um, as indicated to the fellow who answered the phone, um, I told him that I had actually tried to work with the Miami Police Force.
[02:13:24.704 --> 02:13:36.529]  Um, shortly after I actually got back from, uh, you know, serving a little bit of time in Iraq, Afghanistan and some of the other fun areas that our government likes to abuse, um,
[02:13:37.714 --> 02:13:39.775]  And unfortunately, in Miami, I couldn't take the behavior.
[02:13:39.775 --> 02:13:41.596]  It was identical to this.
[02:13:41.596 --> 02:13:52.060]  Miami is famous for, like, shooting peaceful protesters with signs in the face with rubber bullets, and then the captain laughing, going, I love how you shot that bleeping whore in the face.
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:53.801]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[02:13:53.801 --> 02:13:55.101]  Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[02:13:55.101 --> 02:13:55.941]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:55.941 --> 02:13:58.803]  Hey, cops, the government's going to take everything you got, too.
[02:13:58.803 --> 02:14:01.244]  When nobody has rights, it means nobody has them.
[02:14:01.244 --> 02:14:01.544]  Go ahead.
[02:14:01.544 --> 02:14:02.904]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:02.904 --> 02:14:03.504]  No, that's OK.
[02:14:03.504 --> 02:14:04.865]  And here's the thing.
[02:14:04.865 --> 02:14:07.146]  You see, in my opinion, I don't really
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:18.148]  Yeah, but still, he's warped.
[02:14:18.148 --> 02:14:27.076]  I mean, you go shoot somebody's daughter because it was police brutality and they fired you over it because you blew the whistle?
[02:14:27.076 --> 02:14:30.299]  I mean, that's not equal weights and measures, is my point.
[02:14:30.299 --> 02:14:33.101]  I mean, you should never go after somebody's family.
[02:14:33.101 --> 02:14:35.183]  I mean, if you're going to go after somebody, go after them.
[02:14:36.403 --> 02:14:37.206]  Right, exactly.
[02:14:37.206 --> 02:14:40.076]  The thing is, we might be being told the wrong thing also.
[02:14:40.076 --> 02:14:41.721]  That might be a setup to make him look bad.
[02:14:42.677 --> 02:14:43.217]  You're right.
[02:14:43.217 --> 02:14:43.757]  You never know.
[02:14:43.757 --> 02:14:45.158]  That's why there could be multiple ones.
[02:14:45.158 --> 02:14:46.018]  You're right.
[02:14:46.018 --> 02:14:50.540]  I, you know, I tend to, you know, I mean, he's a big Obama supporter and all this other stuff.
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:55.561]  And we've gone back and found records before this happened that he was a big Obama supporter and a gun grabber.
[02:14:55.561 --> 02:14:57.802]  So I've done a lot of research on it.
[02:14:57.802 --> 02:15:04.444]  I'm about 90 percent this is real, but surely they are trying to doll it up and do some things.
[02:15:04.444 --> 02:15:06.665]  What kind of stuff did you see with the Miami police force?
[02:15:08.061 --> 02:15:09.783]  I literally saw the same thing.
[02:15:09.783 --> 02:15:12.105]  Enormous amounts of racism.
[02:15:12.105 --> 02:15:28.420]  In fact, I've lost multiple friends who joined the... I don't want to say, you know, they didn't die or anything, but I lost them to personality changes where they were, for example, Hispanics themselves, and they start calling, you know, using the N-word, using whatever racist slang you could think of, towards their own
[02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:34.680]  I mean, you know, towards their own race, towards, you know, black folks, and it was amazing.
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:37.045]  I couldn't even associate with these people.
[02:15:37.045 --> 02:15:39.830]  And just so you know, I'm actually a former Green Beret, so...
[02:15:40.498 --> 02:15:44.220]  This type of behavior is extremely offensive to me.
[02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:45.701]  There is a gangsterism.
[02:15:45.701 --> 02:15:51.904]  If you look at gang handbooks and gang psychology, police more and more are behaving like a giant street gang.
[02:15:51.904 --> 02:15:52.464]  God bless you.
[02:15:52.464 --> 02:15:54.125]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:54.125 --> 02:15:55.625]  It's just terrible, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:55.625 --> 02:15:58.807]  And the TV just says, worship police no matter what they do.
[02:15:58.807 --> 02:16:02.429]  That gives cover to the bad guys in the system that are taking over.
[02:16:02.429 --> 02:16:05.570]  You're not helping the police putting up with bad behavior, folks.
[02:16:05.570 --> 02:16:08.852]  And we obsess on the police because as the police go, so goes the nation.
[02:16:09.969 --> 02:16:16.651]  Okay, if the police are taken over by the globalists and turned into these crazy psychos, it's going to be a civil war.
[02:16:16.651 --> 02:16:19.891]  And I'm the biggest friend of the police ever, because I don't want to see a bunch of you dead.
[02:16:19.891 --> 02:16:25.073]  I mean, if you guys are hiding out because of Dorner, you start the gun confiscation.
[02:16:25.073 --> 02:16:27.953]  I mean, I've done the math on it.
[02:16:27.953 --> 02:16:28.554]  I know history.
[02:16:28.554 --> 02:16:30.194]  I've studied it.
[02:16:30.194 --> 02:16:33.795]  The cops will stand down is what's going to happen, but if the cops try to engage the American people,
[02:16:35.228 --> 02:16:37.670]  Every cop in America would be killed, basically.
[02:16:37.670 --> 02:16:39.271]  Very quickly.
[02:16:39.271 --> 02:16:40.852]  Very quickly.
[02:16:40.852 --> 02:16:43.874]  Very quickly.
[02:16:43.874 --> 02:16:46.596]  Again, 1% stands up of gun owners.
[02:16:46.596 --> 02:16:50.378]  That's 1.6 million combatants.
[02:16:50.378 --> 02:16:53.300]  Now, you do the math.
[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:56.842]  Being on the offense is so much more powerful.
[02:16:56.842 --> 02:17:00.385]  And if people go on the offense against the police, they're all dead, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:01.041 --> 02:17:02.282]  Now, I don't want to go there.
[02:17:02.282 --> 02:17:03.563]  That's why I keep talking about this.
[02:17:03.563 --> 02:17:05.605]  Let's talk to Chef Max.
[02:17:05.605 --> 02:17:06.745]  Chef Max is in Texas.
[02:17:06.745 --> 02:17:09.047]  Tell us the story of what happened to you.
[02:17:09.047 --> 02:17:10.468]  Well, let me tell you, brother.
[02:17:10.468 --> 02:17:12.430]  I was at work just now.
[02:17:12.430 --> 02:17:17.434]  On my day off from a manager meeting, and right in the middle of the meeting, I get a knock on the door.
[02:17:17.434 --> 02:17:22.678]  The concierge walks up and goes, hey, there's two gentlemen here from the FBI who'd like to speak to you.
[02:17:24.011 --> 02:17:26.632]  So what did they say to you?
[02:17:26.632 --> 02:17:27.553]  What happened?
[02:17:53.476 --> 02:18:04.621]  Well, I've told them that I voice my opinion quite often, and they go, well, you know, we're here to talk to you about a young lady that used to work here, a TSA agent.
[02:18:04.621 --> 02:18:08.783]  She brought some things to our attention that you were asking her, etc.
[02:18:10.465 --> 02:18:12.745]  And I said, well, you know, that doesn't surprise me.
[02:18:12.745 --> 02:18:14.686]  Oh yeah, this is part of the political intimidation.
[02:18:14.686 --> 02:18:21.267]  If you just say you think the government's out of control, they'll send the government at it to make you feel like you're bad, to intimidate you.
[02:18:21.267 --> 02:18:22.247]  It's a whisper campaign.
[02:18:22.247 --> 02:18:24.367]  So you work at the airport?
[02:18:24.367 --> 02:18:27.368]  No, actually, I'm at one of the theaters in Domain.
[02:18:27.368 --> 02:18:28.468]  We met a couple times.
[02:18:28.468 --> 02:18:37.250]  I was there when you bought your Barrett over at the gun shop, and then you came and saw that Vanessa D'Souza movie with your wife and one of the Steiner boys.
[02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:39.510]  Oh yeah, you're the chef over there.
[02:18:41.926 --> 02:18:50.374]  Wait a minute, so, okay, alright, you've got the infrared that we might borrow to go shoot wild hogs?
[02:18:50.374 --> 02:18:51.195]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:51.195 --> 02:19:00.925]  Wow, so I've got to hear this, so somebody that works with the TSA, a little secret police officer, they're now over the streets, I've got to hear this, so please continue.
[02:19:01.758 --> 02:19:08.940]  Okay, she worked for us part-time as a waitress, but at the same time she worked at the airport as a TSA screener.
[02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:15.942]  And at work, at plenty of downtime, we're always talking about politics and current events, etc.
[02:19:15.942 --> 02:19:17.563]  Sure, I've sat around with you talking.
[02:19:17.563 --> 02:19:19.423]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:19:19.423 --> 02:19:26.125]  So, the conversation came up, this is six months ago, about the radiation level at the TSA screeners.
[02:19:26.125 --> 02:19:28.426]  And I told her, go question your
[02:19:29.318 --> 02:19:30.619]  Your supervisors.
[02:19:30.619 --> 02:19:32.161]  How much radiation am I getting?
[02:19:32.161 --> 02:19:36.485]  How much am I, you know... And so for that you got a visit and I was brought up.
[02:19:36.485 --> 02:19:37.186]  We're gonna come back.
[02:19:37.186 --> 02:19:39.128]  Well stay there, I gotta come back.
[02:19:39.128 --> 02:19:40.610]  I mean this is, I know this guy.
[02:19:40.610 --> 02:19:43.473]  He's the chef over there at a really nice movie theater that's got food and stuff.
[02:19:43.473 --> 02:19:44.774]  I've only been to it a couple times.
[02:19:44.774 --> 02:19:47.116]  I want to go back but it's in far north Austin.
[02:19:47.116 --> 02:19:50.480]  I mean we've had political talks and stuff over, you know, over dinner.
[02:19:51.781 --> 02:19:52.562]  Just amazing.
[02:19:52.562 --> 02:20:00.247]  We're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to hear about how I'm a thought criminal, you're a thought criminal, everybody's a thought criminal, like the Founding Fathers.
[02:20:00.247 --> 02:20:01.048]  We're bad guys like them.
[02:20:01.929 --> 02:20:03.330]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:20:03.330 --> 02:20:13.997]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:20:13.997 --> 02:20:18.460]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:21.202]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:20:21.202 --> 02:20:31.849]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:35.951]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:20:35.951 --> 02:20:42.095]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:42.095 --> 02:20:52.000]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.501]  The war is here.
[02:20:53.501 --> 02:20:55.402]  It's an info war.
[02:20:55.402 --> 02:20:58.204]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[02:21:02.057 --> 02:21:07.801]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older one gets.
[02:21:07.801 --> 02:21:17.387]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[02:21:17.387 --> 02:21:24.632]  If the Hunza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone in North America to experience a more youthful life as well.
[02:21:24.632 --> 02:21:27.434]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it
[02:21:27.854 --> 02:21:28.134]  I think so.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:45.481]  Thank you.
[02:22:01.912 --> 02:22:05.114]  Friends, this is Alex Jones for MidasResources.com.
[02:22:05.114 --> 02:22:10.698]  For more than 15 years, I have exclusively used Midas Resources for all my precious metal needs.
[02:22:10.698 --> 02:22:16.322]  Whether it's bullion or collectibles you're looking for, Midas Resources is simply the best.
[02:22:16.322 --> 02:22:18.924]  I own my gold as a hedge against inflation.
[02:22:18.924 --> 02:22:25.268]  This Federal Reserve fiat currency could go the way of the Deutsche Mark and the Weimar Republic any time.
[02:22:25.268 --> 02:22:29.751]  In these historically dangerous times, it makes sense to physically hold gold and silver.
[02:22:30.111 --> 02:22:32.992]  Midas already has some of the best deals in the industry.
[02:22:32.992 --> 02:22:38.575]  But if you give them a call and mention the radio special, they will give you a list of the day's super specials.
[02:22:38.575 --> 02:22:43.897]  Midas brokers are standing by to answer all your questions at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:43.897 --> 02:22:51.240]  They also have a lot of informative free literature explaining the opportunities and risk of holding precious metals.
[02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:53.161]  They are ready to answer your questions at 800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.161 --> 02:22:53.521]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.675 --> 02:23:05.836]  We travel so much, and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:23:05.836 --> 02:23:09.337]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets.
[02:23:09.337 --> 02:23:15.718]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:23:15.718 --> 02:23:27.641]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:23:28.143 --> 02:23:32.809]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[02:23:32.809 --> 02:23:34.591]  And they're so easy to use.
[02:23:34.591 --> 02:23:36.514]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:23:36.514 --> 02:23:40.719]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:23:40.719 --> 02:23:41.941]  Fake TV is only $34.95.
[02:23:43.823 --> 02:23:47.427]  Order your FAKE TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKETV.com.
[02:23:47.427 --> 02:23:48.708]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[02:23:48.708 --> 02:23:50.629]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:08.242 --> 02:24:13.904]  Maybe you ain't got nothing if you ain't free.
[02:24:13.904 --> 02:24:16.144]  They hired Marcus Wolf, the former head of the Stasi.
[02:24:16.144 --> 02:24:17.104]  He died a few years ago.
[02:24:17.104 --> 02:24:18.925]  They hired him back in 2002 at about 05.
[02:24:18.925 --> 02:24:21.225]  When I first heard this, I didn't believe it.
[02:24:21.225 --> 02:24:23.806]  I went and looked at the federal funding purchases.
[02:24:23.806 --> 02:24:29.587]  It was like 1.1 million a year to pay him, the former head of the Stasi, to come here and help set that up.
[02:24:29.587 --> 02:24:31.147]  And it's an intimidation.
[02:24:32.459 --> 02:24:35.780]  And I've had Secret Service and FBI come and say, what'd you mean about this?
[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:39.401]  I mean, the Texas Ranger that was here yesterday was here for 15 minutes.
[02:24:39.401 --> 02:24:41.402]  I didn't get to talk to him as I was on air.
[02:24:41.402 --> 02:24:43.242]  They just told him to go, and then he wouldn't come back.
[02:24:43.242 --> 02:24:44.763]  He said, oh, we've got what we need now.
[02:24:44.763 --> 02:24:46.043]  He's like, so what goes on around here?
[02:24:46.043 --> 02:24:47.163]  I need to check this out.
[02:24:47.163 --> 02:24:48.744]  I only believe mainstream media.
[02:24:48.744 --> 02:24:51.584]  So I called him up and said, the government's criminal.
[02:24:51.584 --> 02:24:52.645]  The government ships in the drugs.
[02:24:52.645 --> 02:24:57.046]  Don't come around here acting like we're bad just because you showed up and you're wearing a cowboy hat.
[02:24:58.732 --> 02:25:00.734]  Let's see you get up there and break a horse right now, son.
[02:25:00.734 --> 02:25:04.857]  I mean, I'm tired of all this, that I'm bad and government's good.
[02:25:04.857 --> 02:25:05.918]  That's what all this is about.
[02:25:05.918 --> 02:25:09.220]  So, I've been over there to the Domain, really nice movie theater.
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:11.702]  Shane's taking his wife, I've taken mine over there.
[02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:20.369]  We watched Dinesh D'Souza's movie, I think that was the night he's talking about, when I had a chance to meet the chef over there, because they have really good gourmet food at that theater, North Austin.
[02:25:20.369 --> 02:25:22.191]  I need to go back over there, there's not an ad for it.
[02:25:22.191 --> 02:25:23.172]  So, starting over,
[02:25:23.672 --> 02:25:25.453]  Tell people what happened.
[02:25:25.453 --> 02:25:29.375]  Okay, so you're trying to help a TSA worker who part-time is a waitress.
[02:25:29.375 --> 02:25:31.317]  That's gonna be a pretty good gig over there.
[02:25:31.317 --> 02:25:34.759]  The average waitress makes 19 bucks an hour, but she made me even more than that.
[02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:38.521]  So she's over there, and I guess we're talking political.
[02:25:38.521 --> 02:25:40.042]  I mean, they just arrested a guy.
[02:25:40.042 --> 02:25:42.163]  He's facing a felony for peanut butter.
[02:25:42.163 --> 02:25:43.504]  You know, I mean, they're crazy.
[02:25:43.504 --> 02:25:44.845]  They want to put us all in camps.
[02:25:44.845 --> 02:25:46.105]  We're their slaves.
[02:25:46.105 --> 02:25:47.106]  So tell us what happened.
[02:25:47.912 --> 02:25:55.338]  Well, I really wanted to get the idea, the mindset of people that actually work there and what she's driving for and what her goals are.
[02:25:55.338 --> 02:26:02.424]  But another part of what I asked her for was any kind of documents, a handbook, etc.
[02:26:02.424 --> 02:26:06.247]  that might give me a better idea of what goes on.
[02:26:06.247 --> 02:26:13.613]  And I made the off comment, the cuff comment, hey, I'll give you a reward if you bring something in.
[02:26:13.613 --> 02:26:15.195]  That's what prompted them to come by.
[02:26:15.695 --> 02:26:20.837]  It was the assumption that I was going to bribe or, you know, pay for information.
[02:26:20.837 --> 02:26:27.699]  Yeah, but see, I wouldn't even have talked to him because they'll spin everything against you or claim you lied about something and try to put you in jail for that.
[02:26:27.699 --> 02:26:31.701]  You know, they put Martha Stewart in jail not for insider trading, but they said she lied.
[02:26:31.701 --> 02:26:32.381]  She didn't do anything.
[02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:33.361]  I've looked at the case.
[02:26:33.361 --> 02:26:35.502]  Meanwhile, the Congress is insider trading publicly.
[02:26:35.942 --> 02:26:38.124]  I mean, I would just say, hold on a minute.
[02:26:38.124 --> 02:26:45.771]  I mean, obviously, hey, I'll make you a nice pizza if you, uh, you know, I want to understand the handbook, you know, like, does the handbook say there's radiation?
[02:26:45.771 --> 02:26:47.153]  We're trying to help them.
[02:26:47.153 --> 02:26:48.073]  It's a public service.
[02:26:48.073 --> 02:26:51.517]  I don't like that stuff's quote classified about the scanners.
[02:26:51.517 --> 02:26:52.538]  So, uh, how did this end?
[02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:53.677]  Oh my god.
[02:27:23.257 --> 02:27:31.622]  You know, shifting the conversation back to you, asking, you know, what my views were on the subject.
[02:27:31.622 --> 02:27:35.825]  At that point, I'm like, look guys, you know, he has a lot of great points.
[02:27:35.825 --> 02:27:38.287]  Do I agree with everything he says?
[02:27:38.287 --> 02:27:39.748]  You know, I'm an individual.
[02:27:39.748 --> 02:27:43.430]  I create my own decisions based on the information I get.
[02:27:43.430 --> 02:27:45.972]  I would have said, what do you think of Alex Jones?
[02:27:45.972 --> 02:27:46.692]  I did.
[02:27:46.692 --> 02:27:48.673]  One of the FBI agents said he's a listener.
[02:27:48.673 --> 02:27:52.116]  I'm like, well... When I had the FBI here last time, they were asking, what...
[02:27:53.616 --> 02:27:55.838]  What's that poster?
[02:27:55.838 --> 02:27:57.619]  And I'm going, it's Obama deception.
[02:27:57.619 --> 02:27:58.020]  It's a film.
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:01.182]  It's been out for like, I mean, it doesn't even matter.
[02:28:01.182 --> 02:28:05.406]  I mean, it's like this implication that I'm doing something wrong.
[02:28:05.406 --> 02:28:08.789]  I mean, and it's just, it's just not happening.
[02:28:08.789 --> 02:28:10.530]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:28:10.530 --> 02:28:12.792]  I went on the aggressive list on my look.
[02:28:12.792 --> 02:28:16.515]  I believe I'm a staunch supporter in the second amendment.
[02:28:16.515 --> 02:28:19.598]  I believe in the right for the people to defend themselves from tyranny.
[02:28:20.305 --> 02:28:26.048]  And I look at them both and I'm like, look, you two will be civilians when you retire.
[02:28:26.048 --> 02:28:28.709]  And then you will want that right.
[02:28:28.709 --> 02:28:31.870]  And that's the only thing keeping us from becoming any other version of the country.
[02:28:31.870 --> 02:28:35.152]  And what did they say at the end of that with the big evil chef at the movie theater?
[02:28:37.262 --> 02:28:38.283]  They agreed with me.
[02:28:38.283 --> 02:28:41.745]  They go, oh yeah, you know, we're supporters of the Second Amendment also.
[02:28:41.745 --> 02:28:47.670]  I'm like, I'm former, you know, the Homeland Security guy was like, I'm former military.
[02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:50.812]  So I was in street clothes and I had my jacket on.
[02:28:50.812 --> 02:28:56.996]  I had a guns and coffee logo patch with kind of a play on the Starbucks.
[02:28:56.996 --> 02:28:59.138]  And we got into the story about, you know, Starbucks.
[02:29:00.559 --> 02:29:12.625]  Well, see, the only thing holding back the tyranny is that most people in the military and the police are still common sense and are good men and women.
[02:29:12.625 --> 02:29:14.846]  They're trying to warp them, though, right now.
[02:29:14.846 --> 02:29:17.607]  And there's a battle right now going on.
[02:29:17.607 --> 02:29:23.750]  And, look, they're not going to worry about when they get out of the government and are, quote, civilians.
[02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:25.031]  They're going to have to worry now.
[02:29:25.031 --> 02:29:26.772]  This is all coming to a head the next few years.
[02:29:27.617 --> 02:29:29.619]  Okay, I mean, there is no future.
[02:29:29.619 --> 02:29:32.621]  They plan to shut this country down and break us.
[02:29:32.621 --> 02:29:34.983]  That is the official plan.
[02:29:34.983 --> 02:29:36.464]  So folks better decide where they stand.
[02:29:36.464 --> 02:29:38.626]  So how did this end, Chef Max?
[02:29:38.626 --> 02:29:39.267]  It went well.
[02:29:39.267 --> 02:29:43.050]  I mean, we parted ways, we shook hands, nothing was wrong.
[02:29:43.050 --> 02:29:44.951]  You know, the investigation was over.
[02:29:44.951 --> 02:29:48.834]  But I want to reiterate every... We'll finish one point, then I promise I'm going to the other callers.
[02:29:48.834 --> 02:29:49.835]  But stay there.
[02:29:49.835 --> 02:29:51.056]  I'm going to go to Williamton.
[02:29:51.056 --> 02:29:52.437]  We're on the march.

[02:33:28.908 --> 02:33:30.409]  Alright, I gotta get to all these other callers.
[02:33:30.409 --> 02:33:33.452]  The State of the Union, so much more.
[02:33:33.452 --> 02:33:35.834]  Looking like 15 stacks of news here, no exaggeration.
[02:33:35.834 --> 02:33:38.496]  It's all up at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:33:38.496 --> 02:33:41.659]  We're here every weekday, 12 noon to 3 pm Eastern.
[02:33:41.659 --> 02:33:44.161]  InfoWars.com, as I said, is the website.
[02:33:44.161 --> 02:33:48.345]  Police audio from Dorner Siege, burn this mother effer down.
[02:33:48.345 --> 02:33:51.107]  Alright, we're gonna go ahead with the plan with the burners.
[02:33:51.107 --> 02:33:56.632]  And now there's more clips of the police saying, we're going to burn him down, we're going to kill him, get the gasoline.
[02:33:58.547 --> 02:34:12.157]  And there are people in the comments, there's almost a thousand comments on this one article that's linked up at DrudgeReport.com saying that, oh no, it's just like Waco, they mean tear gas rounds.
[02:34:12.157 --> 02:34:17.601]  Well yeah, there's also military tear gas that shoots flame out the sides and is well known for starting fires.
[02:34:18.682 --> 02:34:22.264]  Uh, but they've got a tank in there and they say, place the burners.
[02:34:22.264 --> 02:34:23.424]  Okay, they're ignited.
[02:34:23.424 --> 02:34:24.385]  Okay, there's a fire.
[02:34:24.385 --> 02:34:27.566]  I mean, it's... All right, pull building seven.
[02:34:27.566 --> 02:34:29.467]  All right, we gave the order, watch the building come down.
[02:34:29.467 --> 02:34:33.288]  Demolition term, and they say, get back, we're blowing it up.
[02:34:33.288 --> 02:34:38.810]  I mean, you cannot sit there and get me to not understand what's happening.
[02:34:38.810 --> 02:34:41.892]  Chef Max, uh, so, the FBI visited because...
[02:34:43.086 --> 02:34:43.326]  Well, they...
[02:34:59.545 --> 02:35:04.646]  They basically say, you know, hey, don't try and bribe officials, you know.
[02:35:04.646 --> 02:35:10.627]  If you would have offered, you know, actually given her money, then we would have had a case for pursuing this.
[02:35:10.627 --> 02:35:17.389]  I said, I, you know, I totally understand, you know, that's not my, that wasn't my goal, my intentions, you know, just looking for... Yeah, intent is key.
[02:35:17.389 --> 02:35:23.350]  You were like, hey, bring me a manual, they're telling you about radiation or not, and I'll give you a pizza.
[02:35:23.350 --> 02:35:25.711]  Basically, I think that was part of the conversation also.
[02:35:25.711 --> 02:35:27.251]  I love taking care of people and, you know,
[02:35:27.816 --> 02:35:30.198]  I know, you've given me a free pizza.
[02:35:30.198 --> 02:35:31.319]  You're nice.
[02:35:31.319 --> 02:35:32.740]  Everybody needs to come up there.
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:37.803]  But still, you've got the FBI and Homeland Security up there, at your work, you know, high class place.
[02:35:37.803 --> 02:35:43.467]  It's all part of... I mean, I can't believe though, did she run and talk about this to them?
[02:35:43.467 --> 02:35:44.368]  Like she's secret agent?
[02:35:45.897 --> 02:35:53.123]  It was, the conversation was started at work, her supervisor got involved, and before you know it, I mean, this took six months for them to get to me.
[02:35:53.123 --> 02:36:04.493]  You know, it wasn't like they knocked on my door, you know, the day after I had the conversation, but still, I mean, I'm a little person with a view, and a point of view, and I still had two agents.
[02:36:06.412 --> 02:36:09.033]  I mean, big salaries, you know.
[02:36:27.557 --> 02:36:38.428]  Yeah, well, I need to know who these Marines are that gave you this info, because we, you know, we don't think he's crazy either, and we want to make sure, and then I call him back and go, okay, I'll talk to the Marines and see if they want to talk to you.
[02:36:38.428 --> 02:36:42.812]  But I said, do not give me a subpoena or I'm going to fight it, because I go, you're not going to be able to get...
[02:36:43.152 --> 02:36:48.296]  That, with Freedom of the Press, I know things are changing, but he goes, no, no, no, I'm talking to supervisors, you're right, thank you, Mr. Jones.
[02:36:48.296 --> 02:36:49.377]  And I said, what do you mean?
[02:36:49.377 --> 02:36:59.185]  He goes, we've already got, you know, the info you've given us from some other Marines, but your article was helpful, I gotta go, my supervisor says, you know, hang up, but he hung up on me, he won't answer the phone.
[02:36:59.185 --> 02:37:01.467]  And I'm like, I want to talk to the Texas Ranger.
[02:37:01.467 --> 02:37:04.990]  You know, I want to hear what's going on.
[02:37:04.990 --> 02:37:08.753]  I mean, I want to know about, I want to interrogate him.
[02:37:10.017 --> 02:37:22.469]  In a nice way about, I don't buy this story that some guy who was, you know, a mechanic in the Marines has PTSD and goes out and shoots Chris Kyle and then it's an open and shut case and the story's changed so much.
[02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:24.131]  Good to hear from you, Chef Max.
[02:37:24.131 --> 02:37:26.694]  I should have clicked, because I met the guy twice.
[02:37:26.694 --> 02:37:27.695]  Really nice place, folks.
[02:37:27.695 --> 02:37:29.156]  I've been in movie theaters all over the country.
[02:37:29.156 --> 02:37:29.697]  They're swanky.
[02:37:30.669 --> 02:37:35.732]  Some, you know, in a city or something and got an evening, I'll say, oh, where's the local movie theater we can eat dinner?
[02:37:35.732 --> 02:37:39.194]  You know, that's kind of the the end thing the last decade or so with Elmo Draft House.
[02:37:39.194 --> 02:37:40.855]  It started here in Austin.
[02:37:40.855 --> 02:37:41.575]  But they have other ones.
[02:37:41.575 --> 02:37:44.317]  And it's one of the nicest or the nicest I've ever been to.
[02:37:44.317 --> 02:37:45.998]  Very, very nice.
[02:37:45.998 --> 02:37:47.018]  Little plug there.
[02:37:47.018 --> 02:37:49.179]  I get my free tickets.
[02:37:49.179 --> 02:37:52.241]  Let's go to move quick here.
[02:37:52.241 --> 02:37:56.043]  William says he works in intelligence in Virginia.
[02:37:56.043 --> 02:37:57.844]  William, what's your take on the Dorner case?
[02:37:57.844 --> 02:37:58.685]  Is that what you called in about?
[02:37:59.864 --> 02:38:01.445]  Uh, multiple things, sir.
[02:38:01.445 --> 02:38:10.733]  Um, I just, I just want to take a second to kind of explain this, because I listened to what you're saying, you're absolutely correct, but it's almost like your viewers don't understand what's going on.
[02:38:10.733 --> 02:38:15.356]  And when you say it's an info war, you're absolutely right, but it's multi-faceted.
[02:38:15.356 --> 02:38:19.280]  Um, in the Army, we call this a basic flanking maneuver.
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:23.923]  So, the distraction is the main attack, right in your face.
[02:38:23.923 --> 02:38:27.286]  The flanking maneuver, to the left or right, is what they're doing behind the scenes.
[02:38:28.106 --> 02:38:39.570]  So as the administration pecks and pecks and pecks with executive orders or proposed legislation around to the right side, DHS is preparing for military action.
[02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:45.053]  And it's very, very obvious, but if people don't understand what they're seeing, they won't understand it.
[02:38:45.053 --> 02:38:52.359]  Yeah, there's a giant arms build-up and now open admission they're preparing for giant war in all 50 states with the people.
[02:38:52.359 --> 02:39:00.025]  I mean, this is so depressing, so horrible, it means they're going to totally collapse things, and I want to stop it!
[02:39:00.025 --> 02:39:00.906]  Man, I live here!
[02:39:00.906 --> 02:39:03.327]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:39:04.068 --> 02:39:05.888]  This is crazy!
[02:39:05.888 --> 02:39:14.610]  We've got the FBI visiting chefs because they want to learn about the radiation manuals that if they're admitting they're dangerous, trying to help people, federal employees.
[02:39:14.610 --> 02:39:17.211]  Meanwhile, the globalists are gutting the country.
[02:39:17.211 --> 02:39:19.811]  I'm sorry, go ahead and make your point.
[02:39:19.811 --> 02:39:30.093]  So, the second thing I wanted to get to was, in the Army we have a saying about planning for operations, and it is, no plan survives first contact.
[02:39:31.041 --> 02:39:36.007]  So, what you have to understand is, these guys are planning for two outcomes.
[02:39:36.007 --> 02:39:41.034]  They can slowly peck at us until we just forfeit our rights.
[02:39:41.034 --> 02:39:43.457]  Or, they can push us until we fire.
[02:39:44.881 --> 02:39:46.662]  And that's what DHS is there for.
[02:39:46.662 --> 02:39:47.122]  That's right.
[02:39:47.122 --> 02:39:49.763]  People always say to me, well, which is it?
[02:39:49.763 --> 02:39:50.744]  Where's the martial law?
[02:39:50.744 --> 02:39:52.525]  They're trying to ease us into it.
[02:39:52.525 --> 02:39:55.786]  But if it causes too much resistance, they may go all the way.
[02:39:55.786 --> 02:39:56.466]  So you're right.
[02:39:56.466 --> 02:40:03.530]  They've probably got five different plans running simultaneously that run from soft takeover to hard takeover.
[02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:06.711]  And that means detonating nukes and saying the Patriots did it.
[02:40:06.711 --> 02:40:11.193]  They've got five major plans from my study and watching their pre-programming.
[02:40:11.193 --> 02:40:12.814]  See, the programming tells you where they're going.
[02:40:13.294 --> 02:40:14.755]  Oh yes sir, you're absolutely right.
[02:40:14.755 --> 02:40:18.178]  So it's just, people need to understand that this is absolutely real.
[02:40:18.178 --> 02:40:22.701]  And just because you don't see it in your particular neighborhood or area, it doesn't mean it's not going on.
[02:40:22.701 --> 02:40:23.442]  Pay attention to the news.
[02:40:39.170 --> 02:40:40.751]  You're saying Dornan may actually be staged?
[02:41:09.008 --> 02:41:11.090]  No sir, I'm not saying that he staged it.
[02:41:11.090 --> 02:41:15.153]  What I'm saying is, if you notice there was national attention.
[02:41:15.153 --> 02:41:18.937]  Yeah, they decide to give it attention and then it becomes the diversion, yeah.
[02:41:18.937 --> 02:41:20.138]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:41:20.138 --> 02:41:28.725]  Well let me ask you this, because it's now in the Army Times, Stars and Stripes, urban warfare drills, I mean it's admitted they're preparing for total civil unrest, takeover of the states.
[02:41:28.725 --> 02:41:34.410]  That's all actually on the books, public, it's just the general public doesn't look it up so it becomes a rumor.
[02:41:34.410 --> 02:41:35.371]  You know, it's kind of like,
[02:41:35.831 --> 02:41:41.155]  I hear there's a place called the South Pole called the Antarctic, but I never saw it, so it's a rumor.
[02:41:41.155 --> 02:41:43.757]  No, no, it's down there, okay?
[02:41:43.757 --> 02:41:44.938]  And so it's the same thing.
[02:41:44.938 --> 02:41:47.641]  Like, I heard there's a Niagara Falls, but I ain't never saw it.
[02:41:47.641 --> 02:41:51.383]  You know, before there was television and stuff, people had to go off what they were told.
[02:41:51.383 --> 02:41:52.725]  So, it's the same thing.
[02:41:53.745 --> 02:41:58.769]  For people in, quote, intelligence, I guess if you're in Virginia, it's probably military or something, but I don't know.
[02:41:58.769 --> 02:42:05.554]  I mean, are they freaking out over the fact that it's now always been hidden they're preparing for domestic war for about 20 years?
[02:42:05.554 --> 02:42:12.359]  Now they're uncloaking and accelerating the programming, which means they're getting ready to go hot, or at least looking at going hot.
[02:42:12.359 --> 02:42:14.281]  I mean, are people realizing what this means?
[02:42:15.606 --> 02:42:23.268]  Some of them are, sir, but you also have to remember, the Beltway is kind of immune to everything else going on outside of that area.
[02:42:23.268 --> 02:42:25.909]  It's in a bubble like Hitler's bunker.
[02:42:25.909 --> 02:42:26.609]  Absolutely.
[02:42:26.609 --> 02:42:30.730]  So people here aren't really feeling the financial crunch that everyone else is.
[02:42:30.730 --> 02:42:31.891]  Some people are living in a dream.
[02:42:31.891 --> 02:42:40.493]  I work with some people who are completely aware of what's going on, but at the same time they say, I have to make a paycheck, I have to put food on my table, I gotta pay my house mortgage.
[02:42:40.493 --> 02:42:42.254]  And I keep telling them, well if you don't
[02:42:44.404 --> 02:42:46.845]  You may not have a house to pay for.
[02:42:46.845 --> 02:42:48.985]  You may not have a table to put food on.
[02:42:48.985 --> 02:43:03.548]  That's what's scary is that the programs work from deindustrialization, hardcore depression, reorganization, breaking of the American people, on the light end, to absolute Mao Zedong, kill half America level crap.
[02:43:03.548 --> 02:43:06.888]  And I've studied history so much, folks, I'm not saying that to scare you.
[02:43:06.888 --> 02:43:09.409]  They're leaning towards Mao Zedong level stuff.
[02:43:10.029 --> 02:43:13.950]  So, once the gloves come off, folks, it's just going to be hell on earth.
[02:43:13.950 --> 02:43:16.431]  And I hope everybody understands they were warned.
[02:43:16.431 --> 02:43:17.732]  Go ahead.
[02:43:17.732 --> 02:43:18.172]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:18.172 --> 02:43:22.053]  And from my military experience, I was in Fallujah.
[02:43:22.053 --> 02:43:22.793]  I was there.
[02:43:22.793 --> 02:43:26.694]  And I saw that, you know, we were almost no holds barred there.
[02:43:26.694 --> 02:43:29.035]  And I'm telling people they need to listen.
[02:43:29.035 --> 02:43:31.156]  And from my personal experience, my personal opinion,
[02:43:32.210 --> 02:43:39.416]  I believe that the main plan is to prepare for a military conflict within the United States of America.
[02:43:39.416 --> 02:43:45.621]  DHS is openly ordering all these things you would need for an open conflict.
[02:43:45.621 --> 02:43:47.923]  And people... And a long war!
[02:43:47.923 --> 02:43:51.006]  A long war where they're going to be forced into certain regions.
[02:43:51.006 --> 02:43:53.428]  I mean, they plan a full-out long war.
[02:43:53.428 --> 02:44:00.834]  And Mr. Jones, the only issue I've ever had for you, had against you, and I've been listening for a long time,
[02:44:01.613 --> 02:44:05.857]  Is that you hesitate to tell people how bad things will get.
[02:44:05.857 --> 02:44:07.298]  And it's because you don't want to scare people.
[02:44:07.298 --> 02:44:08.279]  I understand that.
[02:44:08.279 --> 02:44:09.520]  But people need to hear it.
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:15.005]  People don't understand how quickly, you know, their area can be cordoned off.
[02:44:15.005 --> 02:44:20.150]  And forces can come in and blow through houses so fast they don't know what hit them.
[02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:25.134]  They don't understand that, you know, their water and power can be shut off to a specific area.
[02:44:25.134 --> 02:44:26.776]  And you can be waited out.
[02:44:27.785 --> 02:44:33.888]  And the issue is, at first, they're going to wipe people out, put out PR on them to demonize them, but then, I know what's going to happen.
[02:44:33.888 --> 02:44:37.930]  The veterans and people are not that they're scared, they're just been waiting.
[02:44:37.930 --> 02:44:41.312]  They're going to go completely ape against anybody in the government.
[02:44:41.312 --> 02:44:46.034]  I mean, from your research, what do you think is going to happen to people in the military and police once the Civil War kicks off?
[02:44:47.469 --> 02:44:58.235]  I think the line will be drawn, people will pick a side, but you also have to understand that as many arms as we may have on the civilian side and I own the weapons, I'm a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment.
[02:44:58.235 --> 02:45:10.801]  You also have to remember, during the invasion of Iraq, you had Iraqis who believed, because they were told by Saddam Hussein, that if they put plastic wrap over RPGs, they could destroy the Abrams' invisible force field.
[02:45:10.801 --> 02:45:11.602]  Okay?
[02:45:11.602 --> 02:45:16.004]  Not that Americans believe things like that, but if you think about what we will go up against
[02:45:16.849 --> 02:45:25.833]  Okay, all the gun owners there are in America won't make a difference against the Abrams, or Bradleys, or Strikers, or UAVs with Hellfire.
[02:45:25.833 --> 02:45:29.654]  Sure, well what's going to happen is, but I mean, still, they couldn't hold all of Baghdad.
[02:45:29.654 --> 02:45:34.596]  What you're saying is true, but the issue is it's going to be like Dorners.
[02:45:34.596 --> 02:45:39.018]  It's going to be people where they go out, get one person, and then never do anything again.
[02:45:39.018 --> 02:45:44.220]  I mean, I've studied the history of total resistance, it's just going to be horrible.
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:45.521]  I just want to not have this happen.
[02:45:46.405 --> 02:45:48.066]  I just want to have America wake up.
[02:45:48.066 --> 02:45:50.707]  The problem is that it looks like the system is just hammered down.
[02:45:50.707 --> 02:46:00.672]  And if libertarians and constitutionalists and conservatives and liberals don't wake up and say no to this tyranny, it's over.
[02:46:00.672 --> 02:46:01.192]  God bless you.
[02:46:01.192 --> 02:46:02.072]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:02.072 --> 02:46:03.113]  Anything else you want to add, William?
[02:46:04.005 --> 02:46:06.807]  Yeah, just real quick, the whole donor thing.
[02:46:06.807 --> 02:46:14.694]  People need to understand that that episode revealed the weakness and the lie behind terrorism in the United States of America.
[02:46:14.694 --> 02:46:19.998]  One guy, a reservist in the Navy, he doesn't get specialized training like the Army or the Marine Corps.
[02:46:19.998 --> 02:46:29.746]  He took very basic CI training, and he almost defeated the LAPD, the FBI, the Marshals, and they had Reapers or drones out there looking for him.
[02:46:30.266 --> 02:46:35.288]  This will tell you, if there were ever real terrorists in America, we could not stop them.
[02:46:35.288 --> 02:46:36.949]  We had all the assets we could have.
[02:46:36.949 --> 02:46:46.754]  But that's what I'm saying, if it goes to civil war, the veterans are going to go asymmetrical, and there's going to be no way to stop them, because they're not going to be popping up for the predator to get them.
[02:46:46.754 --> 02:46:51.056]  It's going to be a bunch of off-duty cops who are at a bar, and you know what happens.
[02:46:51.056 --> 02:46:53.277]  I mean, it's just, and that's what they're preparing for.
[02:46:53.277 --> 02:46:55.418]  They're training police for five years.
[02:46:55.418 --> 02:46:57.299]  You will face veterans with IEDs.
[02:46:57.739 --> 02:47:01.022]  Well, you're going to have to kill veterans' families before they come after you.
[02:47:01.022 --> 02:47:01.482]  And they are.
[02:47:01.482 --> 02:47:03.303]  They're planning to try to come arrest everybody.
[02:47:03.303 --> 02:47:07.967]  I mean, they're going to force us into a civil war to wipe us all out.
[02:47:07.967 --> 02:47:08.908]  That's the goal.
[02:47:08.908 --> 02:47:11.330]  We've got to get that word out and stop it.
[02:47:11.330 --> 02:47:11.850]  God bless you.
[02:47:11.850 --> 02:47:16.073]  I appreciate the call, but I just can't believe we're talking like this on air.
[02:47:16.073 --> 02:47:17.754]  And the thing is, I know I'm right.
[02:47:17.754 --> 02:47:20.877]  I know that's where it's going, and now it's all materializing.
[02:47:20.877 --> 02:47:22.078]  But let me tell you why they could win.
[02:47:24.738 --> 02:47:26.239]  They'll nuke a city or something.
[02:47:26.239 --> 02:47:27.320]  They'll go that bad.
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:30.082]  Or say Patriots released a bioweapon.
[02:47:30.082 --> 02:47:32.383]  And have the guy captured and have him confess to it.
[02:47:32.383 --> 02:47:40.028]  And they'll use, you know, 20 million dead from some horrible mousepox as the thing of it was the gun owners that did it.
[02:47:40.028 --> 02:47:43.011]  I mean, folks, you gotta understand, they're confident for a reason.
[02:47:43.011 --> 02:47:45.372]  They got nasty stuff up their sleeve.
[02:47:45.372 --> 02:47:46.473]  And it's not our military.
[02:47:46.473 --> 02:47:48.074]  It's a foreign global tech
[02:47:48.114 --> 02:47:56.940]  A technocracy, that's what they call it themselves, a technotronic technocracy of scientific masterminds programming the U.S.
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:47:58.661]  military and government.
[02:47:58.661 --> 02:48:05.646]  Programming us for self-destruction, shutting everything down, dumbing down the family, injecting our troops with cancer virus shots.
[02:48:05.646 --> 02:48:08.208]  I mean, it's just, it's total war.
[02:48:08.208 --> 02:48:08.888]  The U.S.
[02:48:08.888 --> 02:48:10.910]  is under attack.
[02:48:10.910 --> 02:48:13.912]  This is a foreign New World Order takeover, what you're saying.
[02:48:15.131 --> 02:48:16.491]  People say, well, why are you still alive?
[02:48:16.491 --> 02:48:20.913]  Because they don't want to kill me because then that would add credibility to what I've done.
[02:48:20.913 --> 02:48:23.033]  They don't want to martyr me yet.
[02:48:23.033 --> 02:48:23.353]  Okay?
[02:48:23.353 --> 02:48:24.414]  And I'm not looking to die.
[02:48:24.414 --> 02:48:25.114]  I don't want to die.
[02:48:25.114 --> 02:48:26.194]  But I mean, you know what?
[02:48:26.194 --> 02:48:29.755]  I'm not worried about it, folks, because I know how real this is.
[02:48:29.755 --> 02:48:31.076]  I want to beat these people, man.
[02:48:31.076 --> 02:48:32.436]  I want the good guys to win.
[02:48:32.436 --> 02:48:36.037]  I don't... I've studied this so I know how they work so we can beat them.
[02:48:39.898 --> 02:48:47.806]  And you know, I've talked to generals and people, retired generals, famous ones, current people, and you talk to them and they go, wow, how do you know this?
[02:48:47.806 --> 02:48:48.526]  I never thought of that.
[02:48:48.526 --> 02:48:50.929]  They're not even that, it's not that they're not smart.
[02:48:50.929 --> 02:48:53.831]  They've never been uncompartmentalized.
[02:48:53.831 --> 02:48:56.594]  And I don't know, I can't believe I know more than those people.
[02:48:56.594 --> 02:49:00.538]  I just, even in the government, I'm not that special, folks.
[02:49:00.538 --> 02:49:03.741]  It's not a good feeling to know more than almost anybody else.
[02:49:05.609 --> 02:49:08.712]  I mean, I know what the globalists at the top know, but I'm not with them.
[02:49:08.712 --> 02:49:10.935]  I've reverse-engineered their whole program.
[02:49:10.935 --> 02:49:15.600]  And I've confirmed my analysis through their actions, and I'm just like, oh my God.
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:17.722]  Oh my God, we've got to warn people.
[02:49:17.722 --> 02:49:19.144]  Please, God, heal this country.
[02:49:19.144 --> 02:49:21.567]  I mean, I pray hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:21.567 --> 02:49:22.247]  I pray hard.
[02:49:22.247 --> 02:49:22.668]  I mean, this is...
[02:49:23.749 --> 02:49:26.650]  This is the calm before the storm, as crazy as things are.
[02:49:26.650 --> 02:49:29.331]  Okay, let's go to Andre in Florida.
[02:49:29.331 --> 02:49:30.611]  I'm going to go to Michael.
[02:49:30.611 --> 02:49:31.851]  No, Michael's first.
[02:49:31.851 --> 02:49:35.532]  Michael is a former Marine on the Dorner subject.
[02:49:35.532 --> 02:49:36.813]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:49:36.813 --> 02:49:38.933]  Yeah, hi.
[02:49:38.933 --> 02:49:47.936]  When I first heard about this whole thing, the first thing I thought about was Gordon Cole and Ruby Ridge and Waco, Texas.
[02:49:47.936 --> 02:49:50.957]  Yeah, they burned out Gordon Cole, Ruby Ridge, Waco, all of them, yeah.
[02:49:52.048 --> 02:49:54.770]  So that was the first thing I thought of.
[02:49:54.770 --> 02:50:21.011]  Um, the second thing I thought of was that I had to talk to you because, um, see, I'm a Roman Catholic layman who is an exorcist, and I've used exorcism against, uh, since 1990, senators and representatives in the 30 or so that I called and specifically said, you're going to fight for God or you're going to lose your next election because I'm going to do exorcisms on you until you break.
[02:50:22.023 --> 02:50:24.766]  I told the staffs that.
[02:50:24.766 --> 02:50:32.314]  And none of them chose to call me back whether they were Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, whatever, Catholic, non-Catholic.
[02:50:33.388 --> 02:50:36.449]  And I did, and they all lost their next election.
[02:50:36.449 --> 02:50:37.390]  Period.
[02:50:37.390 --> 02:50:38.890]  I can prove this any time.
[02:50:38.890 --> 02:50:39.150]  Wow.
[02:50:39.150 --> 02:50:40.031]  Well, send me a letter.
[02:50:40.031 --> 02:50:40.811]  It's very interesting.
[02:50:40.811 --> 02:50:42.672]  I know this is a psych warfare thing.
[02:50:42.672 --> 02:50:44.432]  These people, most of them are occultists.
[02:50:44.432 --> 02:50:47.634]  If you do tell them you're doing rituals against them, it'll freak them out.
[02:50:47.634 --> 02:50:51.655]  See, they're all just used to people bowing down and laying down.
[02:50:51.655 --> 02:50:53.696]  They're not used to people standing up, folks.
[02:50:53.696 --> 02:50:54.537]  They need your mind.
[02:50:54.537 --> 02:50:59.078]  Okay, I'll give you like a minute on the other side, then I've got to go to Andre, Carl, and Chris.
[02:50:59.078 --> 02:51:02.040]  I've got to get to everybody, because then I've got to go on a TV show right after the show.
[02:51:02.040 --> 02:51:03.160]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:14.083]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[02:51:14.083 --> 02:51:18.545]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[02:51:18.545 --> 02:51:21.286]  But we can't do that without your help.
[02:51:21.286 --> 02:51:32.049]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[02:51:32.549 --> 02:51:36.032]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[02:51:36.032 --> 02:51:42.216]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:51:42.216 --> 02:51:52.083]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[02:51:52.083 --> 02:51:53.584]  The war is here.

[02:54:14.483 --> 02:54:36.787]  Look, if we don't get a healthy mistrust of government now and get back to the Bill of Rights Constitution, which is designed to protect us to a certain extent, it's over.
[02:54:36.787 --> 02:54:39.868]  It's like going down a submarine 10,000 feet and opening a portal.
[02:54:40.908 --> 02:54:43.069]  We don't want to open the portal.
[02:54:43.069 --> 02:54:46.010]  There's already water spraying in and the government's like, open it all the way!
[02:54:46.010 --> 02:54:47.650]  It's going to be nice!
[02:54:47.650 --> 02:54:49.011]  And I'm saying, no it's not.
[02:54:49.011 --> 02:54:50.871]  That last fellow I was going to talk to hung up.
[02:54:50.871 --> 02:54:52.512]  But let's go to callers quickly.
[02:54:52.512 --> 02:54:54.232]  Carl in Oregon, you're on the air.
[02:54:54.232 --> 02:54:54.832]  Thanks for holding.
[02:54:54.832 --> 02:54:56.793]  You're a trooper.
[02:54:56.793 --> 02:54:57.813]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:57.813 --> 02:54:58.714]  Good to talk to you again.
[02:54:58.714 --> 02:55:03.855]  I have a friend in the fire department who works closely with the San Bernardino County Sheriff.
[02:55:03.855 --> 02:55:07.596]  And this is called Operation Tort Bad Guy.
[02:55:07.596 --> 02:55:08.777]  That's what this whole operation is about.
[02:55:10.148 --> 02:55:14.009]  Well, I mean, we got like four different tapes of them saying we're going to burn him down and kill him.
[02:55:14.009 --> 02:55:15.829]  We're going to burn down the house.
[02:55:15.829 --> 02:55:18.390]  People are like, they don't mean burn down the house.
[02:55:18.390 --> 02:55:23.051]  CNN's like, burn down the house is code for ice cream cones.
[02:55:23.051 --> 02:55:25.912]  So what did your source tell you?
[02:55:25.912 --> 02:55:28.332]  They don't want this individual to be able to get his story out.
[02:55:28.332 --> 02:55:36.874]  Don't want him to be some type of a folk hero, be able to write a book, and be able to expose anything that could perhaps bring down their credibility.
[02:55:36.874 --> 02:55:37.414]  Well, of course.
[02:55:37.414 --> 02:55:39.115]  So they burned him up.
[02:55:39.115 --> 02:55:39.495]  Exactly.
[02:55:40.925 --> 02:55:44.767]  Yeah, my friends worked with him for years and that's just normal protocol.
[02:55:44.767 --> 02:55:51.391]  When you have a situation like that, a cop killer that's out there taking out one of their own, you know, all bets are off.
[02:55:51.391 --> 02:55:56.113]  You know, I wish the police would act like this when citizens got killed.
[02:55:56.113 --> 02:55:59.335]  Oh yes, yes, but there's, you know, it's a brotherhood.
[02:55:59.335 --> 02:56:00.455]  You gotta understand infantility.
[02:56:00.455 --> 02:56:02.216]  It's a brotherhood among each other.
[02:56:02.216 --> 02:56:05.278]  It's a comradery that they, you know, if somebody goes rogue in their system,
[02:56:06.236 --> 02:56:09.819]  They're going to have to cover this up immediately so that way nothing can go sideways on them.
[02:56:09.819 --> 02:56:14.582]  No, but they're so arrogant now with the cover-ups that they're all on the radio saying we're going to burn it up and kill him.
[02:56:14.582 --> 02:56:17.905]  And now they're going, oh, burn down the house is code for something else.
[02:56:17.905 --> 02:56:20.067]  They're actually saying that.
[02:56:20.067 --> 02:56:21.988]  Oh yeah, what they did is they sent a flare.
[02:56:21.988 --> 02:56:25.230]  It's called, you know, it's called flaring the house.
[02:56:25.230 --> 02:56:27.192]  And then they cordoned him off and then they took him out.
[02:56:28.465 --> 02:56:30.166]  Or unless he shot himself, I don't know.
[02:56:30.166 --> 02:56:33.567]  Yeah, they told the news, cut the feed, and I said, oh, looks like they're going to burn him up.
[02:56:33.567 --> 02:56:41.289]  And they burn him up, and people are like, well, you've got four tapes of them saying they were going to burn him up and burn down the house, but that means something different, conspiracy theorist.
[02:56:41.289 --> 02:56:44.610]  You know, it's like if you saw an elephant in your living room, that's not an elephant, that's a grey mouse.
[02:56:44.610 --> 02:56:47.211]  You're like, well, it's gigantic.
[02:56:47.211 --> 02:56:48.811]  You're not a crazy person, are you?
[02:56:48.811 --> 02:56:50.072]  Good to hear from you, Carl.
[02:56:50.072 --> 02:56:51.592]  Chris in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:56:51.592 --> 02:56:53.613]  Go ahead, military, your take on this.
[02:56:55.095 --> 02:56:57.878]  My take on this is actually pretty simple.
[02:56:57.878 --> 02:57:05.525]  I served overseas in both theaters and I've thrown flashbangs and all types of shit in all types of rooms.
[02:57:05.525 --> 02:57:14.154]  And I'm an active duty armed service member and I'm actually in a combat MOS, which means I don't clean laundry or work in a supply room or anything like that.
[02:57:14.154 --> 02:57:16.636]  I go outside the wire and I actively look for roadside bombs.
[02:57:16.636 --> 02:57:17.137]  It's what we do.
[02:57:17.917 --> 02:57:22.162]  And in doing this a lot of times, we actually raid homes and we'll throw flashbangs in.
[02:57:22.162 --> 02:57:26.868]  I've thrown flashbangs in rooms full of HME, homemade explosives, and nothing's happened.
[02:57:27.719 --> 02:57:30.202]  People hit the deck, they drop, they cover their heads.
[02:57:30.202 --> 02:57:31.263]  That stuff's pretty unstable.
[02:57:31.263 --> 02:57:35.607]  So I don't see how you could throw a flashbang in a room and cause rounds to cook off.
[02:57:35.607 --> 02:57:41.112]  And it's actually... Oh, obviously, they're like, oh, the flashbang has the rounds cooking off.
[02:57:41.112 --> 02:57:42.554]  Well, OK, it's on tape.
[02:57:42.554 --> 02:57:49.381]  We said burn the mother-effer down, but that doesn't mean burn the... Burn the mother-effing house down doesn't mean burn the house down now.
[02:57:50.566 --> 02:57:52.348]  Yeah, I understand completely.
[02:57:52.348 --> 02:57:54.170]  And I wanted to touch on something else, too.
[02:57:54.170 --> 02:58:01.279]  You were talking about a lot of the urban warfare that's going on, or the training that goes on at the Mount training, which is really a big part of what we do.
[02:58:01.279 --> 02:58:02.480]  Combat in urban terrain.
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:04.503]  So you're training to fight the American people?
[02:58:06.027 --> 02:58:17.532]  I'm not going to say that, but what I will say is in the beginning when I joined in 2005, when we went to our mount sites, that's our training sites, they were mock parts of the cities, like mock parts of Tikrit or Baghdad or Kirkuk.
[02:58:17.532 --> 02:58:18.533]  And that was in the beginning.
[02:58:18.533 --> 02:58:25.916]  And when you raided a building, you walked into a building that pretty much looked like a mud hut, but gray because it was built with cinder blocks because they wanted to be cost efficient.
[02:58:25.916 --> 02:58:30.518]  Well, now a lot of our training areas you go to, it looks like downtown USA.
[02:58:32.014 --> 02:58:33.496]  Yeah, I know.
[02:58:33.496 --> 02:58:34.417]  You're compartmentalized.
[02:58:34.417 --> 02:58:35.859]  At the higher levels, it's declassified.
[02:58:35.859 --> 02:58:36.700]  It's for the American people.
[02:58:36.700 --> 02:58:37.521]  It's public.
[02:58:37.521 --> 02:58:38.082]  Incredible.
