[00:00.000 --> 00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.560 --> 00:20.200]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:20.200 --> 00:39.800]  Alex Jones
[00:39.800 --> 00:43.960]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Wednesday the 13th
[00:43.960 --> 00:51.040]  day of February 2013 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours and we are
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.800]  going to have open phones as well again thank you so much for joining us here
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.000]  today I am your host Alex Jones a lot of these video and audio clips are gonna be
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.160]  playing speak for themselves two hours before Chris Dorner reportedly got
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.680]  burned up inside of that to cabin after killing another sheriff's deputy in Big
[01:13.680 --> 01:20.920]  Bear outside Los Angeles up in the mountains and then on top of it well I
[01:20.920 --> 01:26.840]  guess the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department on top of it you know also
[01:26.840 --> 01:31.480]  seeing the SWAT team surround it and all the rest of this I shot a video two
[01:31.480 --> 01:38.960]  hours before saying that I expect to see it go up in flames we're gonna play that
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.200]  clip coming up people are like how on earth did you know this well the
[01:44.200 --> 01:49.360]  standard procedure with someone held up in a house with a firearm that's already
[01:49.360 --> 01:56.200]  killed police or government gods is to use an armored vehicle or tank to knock
[01:56.200 --> 02:01.120]  down the walls and then set the place on fire that's what they did at Waco and
[02:01.120 --> 02:04.640]  that's why Waco was so evil because David Koresh could have been picked up
[02:04.640 --> 02:08.520]  in town at any time he went into town every day they had an auto repair shop
[02:08.520 --> 02:12.560]  a couple miles away he went into town to the grocery store he he jogged outside
[02:12.560 --> 02:17.080]  the Branch Davidian ranch that they called a compound to dehumanize them and
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.960]  they went to have a PR stunt with the ATF to shoot the place up the Davidians
[02:20.960 --> 02:24.680]  fought back so then they had the military come in and engage in a siege
[02:24.680 --> 02:28.840]  and burn the place down shoot people trying to get out and blew up the little
[02:28.840 --> 02:33.720]  newborn babies and people and then posed with their skulls later these were not
[02:33.720 --> 02:40.400]  warriors these were these were psychopathic demons and you see the LAPD
[02:40.400 --> 02:43.440]  not even apologizing for shooting up vehicles that didn't even match the
[02:43.440 --> 02:50.560]  description you see just the insanity of the government cult and it is a
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.360]  government cult these people in these corrupt police departments think they're
[02:54.360 --> 02:57.080]  rock stars and the government bureaucrats above them think they're
[02:57.080 --> 03:01.600]  royalty anybody who's worked around them has seen it for themselves and America
[03:01.600 --> 03:06.880]  is going the same way as any other corrupt Empire now that said Dorner I
[03:06.880 --> 03:10.480]  thought from the beginning this was a real story just because it looks like a
[03:10.480 --> 03:15.600]  real story it acts like one that the government's all disjointed and badly
[03:15.600 --> 03:21.280]  coordinated and in the Asian PR disasters when you see real staged
[03:21.280 --> 03:28.760]  events the script is written minute one and it all rolls out and they have their
[03:28.760 --> 03:32.920]  targeted liberty that they're trying to take or the power they're trying to
[03:32.920 --> 03:38.680]  seize but it was not a hard prediction we're gonna play a clip of this here in
[03:38.680 --> 03:42.200]  a moment that they would burn it down first there's a clip of San Bernardino
[03:42.200 --> 03:47.640]  sheriff's on the radios talking with the LAPD who was not in charge officially
[03:47.640 --> 03:51.520]  but was in charge they brought in the SWAT teams and the armored vehicles and
[03:51.520 --> 03:55.000]  they're talking about let's just go ahead and play the clip right now here
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.200]  it is oh yeah yeah yeah the clip we're gonna play is cops burn that house down
[04:01.200 --> 04:05.680]  believe but you know we're not gonna go to it now we're gonna have a meeting

[08:04.240 --> 08:28.280]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[08:28.280 --> 08:37.720]  well Christopher Dorner went out Waco style and I know the establishment is
[08:37.720 --> 08:44.280]  not happy because there wasn't 28 children 17 of them under the age of 10
[08:44.280 --> 08:48.680]  many of them newborn babies or toddlers this wasn't a real trophy event where
[08:48.680 --> 08:53.440]  they could pose with the dead children skulls and their dead bodies to show off
[08:53.440 --> 08:58.040]  what tough guys they are like when you watch Waco the rules of engagement it
[08:58.040 --> 09:04.600]  shows DoD snipers and ATF at FBI snipers standing around bragging about how
[09:04.600 --> 09:11.000]  they're honed honed to kill and just incredibly manly to have the tanks knock
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.480]  down the walls and shoot Davidians as they tried to get out and then put a
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.080]  anti-personnel a shape-charge mine on top of the church records vault and kill
[09:19.080 --> 09:25.240]  everybody inside in fact the only thing more manly was the LAPD big fans of what
[09:25.240 --> 09:30.720]  they did shooting up a truck a different make and model and brand and color
[09:30.720 --> 09:34.760]  Dorners driving a silver pickup well if you see a blue pickup doing a paper
[09:34.760 --> 09:39.280]  route with two women that's obviously Dorner no different color women a woman
[09:39.280 --> 09:43.000]  in the back throwing papers out open fire you know shoot them up shoot them
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.480]  both you know you pull a white guy over in a car tell them go ahead and leave
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.760]  and then ram him ten seconds later and shoot his vehicle up good good in fact I
[09:51.760 --> 09:58.120]  think they ought to just have gunships flying in AC 130s with Gatling guns but
[09:58.120 --> 10:03.480]  also a 10 warthogs and just fly up and down the major Los Angeles and Southern
[10:03.480 --> 10:08.520]  California roads and just open fire like it was the highway of death outside of
[10:08.520 --> 10:13.880]  Kuwait going into Iraq and just take them out because because it that would
[10:13.880 --> 10:16.600]  be like a sacrifice that's why government always demands human
[10:16.600 --> 10:20.240]  sacrifice once it gets powerful enough is that the public needs to be taught
[10:20.240 --> 10:29.880]  you are the food you are the food you are here to be eaten for dinner and I
[10:29.880 --> 10:35.120]  think it's absolutely wonderful and again I think it's wonderful what
[10:35.120 --> 10:38.160]  happened last night so I was able to predict two hours before I said I think
[10:38.160 --> 10:41.400]  they're gonna burn him down Waco style and we're gonna play a clip of that
[10:41.400 --> 10:45.320]  where I predicted it uploaded it time stamp to YouTube time stamp to info wars
[10:45.320 --> 10:49.640]  calm because it's standard procedure to go on with a tank and ram it and then
[10:49.640 --> 10:53.200]  tell the media cut the feed just like Waco and they'll do it if we do it and
[10:53.200 --> 10:56.200]  we'll put your says this is unprecedented no it's not they cut the
[10:56.200 --> 11:01.520]  feed I shot a video one minute after and uploaded it called Chris Dorner torched
[11:01.520 --> 11:10.800]  Waco style and we break down the fact that in fact that's the video I shot
[11:10.800 --> 11:18.080]  actually after after I was confirmed right if you actually go to info wars
[11:18.080 --> 11:23.880]  calm there's another article there you go to our YouTube page and I break it
[11:23.880 --> 11:28.720]  all down I'll give you the actual name of that video here in just a moment yes
[11:28.720 --> 11:33.840]  it's Chris Dorner CNN cuts live feed Alex Jones predicts they will burn him
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.520]  Waco style that is the actual name of a video that I put out roughly two hours
[11:40.520 --> 11:47.040]  before the the torching you see the videos I shot Chris Dorner cornered CNN
[11:47.040 --> 11:51.720]  cuts live feed I predict they'll torch him then checkpoints paralyzed big bear
[11:51.720 --> 11:55.720]  and then after it happened well while it was starting to burn Chris Dorner torched
[11:55.720 --> 12:01.960]  Waco style and it was not hard to know the standard default infantry training
[12:01.960 --> 12:05.960]  that SWAT teams and they are domestic military groups it's against the law
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.840]  against the Constitution Miller eyes but doesn't matter because a military fights
[12:10.840 --> 12:14.040]  an enemy and so that that's why the public is now seen as the enemy by more
[12:14.040 --> 12:18.480]  and more of these departments and paramilitary groups and I understand the
[12:18.480 --> 12:21.840]  need for special teams sometimes but they're using them for checkpoints on
[12:21.840 --> 12:25.240]  the highways now they're that they've got military drills all over the country
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.960]  and they're now admitting oh we are acclimating you and we're working with
[12:27.960 --> 12:31.480]  the local police department with role players screaming I'm not turning my
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.800]  guns in and saying you know I need food see they're preparing for a collapse in
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.640]  a war with the American people in the reorganization of the country so I was
[12:41.640 --> 12:44.080]  being a little bit sarcastic they're saying you know this is all wonderful
[12:44.080 --> 12:48.800]  this is actually horrible and see I don't hate the police out of hand
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.880]  they're just brainwashed Americans like everybody else and when I see these
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.080]  really corrupt out of control fear driven running off the edge of a cliff
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.320]  from their own shadow it really freaks me out it freaks me out that they're
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.400]  shooting up cars and running checkpoints and beating people up and I watched live
[13:06.400 --> 13:11.440]  feeds from helicopters as they had traffic backed up 20 miles up in the
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.120]  mountains by Big Bear and they would actually aim guns at families in their
[13:16.120 --> 13:20.640]  cars and and and go through their cars when they knew Dorner was surrounded and
[13:20.640 --> 13:27.440]  they pinned him in the house it was just all a big excuse to power grab I mean
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.240]  I've seen cases now where there'll be a bank robbery and they'll shut down major
[13:30.240 --> 13:36.040]  highways and then just have guns aimed at people as they drive up and again
[13:36.040 --> 13:39.200]  it's this attitude of we're gonna March your kids out of the school in a drill
[13:39.200 --> 13:42.480]  we're gonna put our hands on you with the TSA we're gonna set up warrantless
[13:42.480 --> 13:48.480]  checkpoints I mean this is America becoming North Korea and obviously I am
[13:48.480 --> 13:53.400]  pretty freaked out right now by the fact that they did another Waco style event
[13:53.400 --> 13:58.640]  and they didn't know if he had hostages in there I mean if they would have had
[13:58.640 --> 14:02.400]  17 little children under the age of 10 would they have barbecued him and then
[14:02.400 --> 14:07.440]  said that said that Dorner said it now now here's the deal this just shows the
[14:07.440 --> 14:13.120]  lying culture now out in the open out in everyone's face we're gonna play some of
[14:13.120 --> 14:15.880]  the clips the news clip in the scanner clip here in a moment thinking into
[14:15.880 --> 14:23.360]  Obama's State of the Union but imagine how obvious it is when they say they're
[14:23.360 --> 14:28.600]  asking the media to cut the live feeds as they're surrounding and have armored
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.760]  wheeled tanks pulling up about to do an infantry maneuver standard military
[14:33.760 --> 14:37.960]  maneuver knock down the walls when you've got infantry inside and they
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.840]  don't have any tank weapons and then fire bomb it I mean it's one-on-one or
[14:42.840 --> 14:48.580]  bring a helicopter in like Randy Weaver with a big bucket of gasoline that they
[14:48.580 --> 14:52.200]  can remote control and drop on top of the house but media didn't follow orders
[14:52.200 --> 14:56.160]  and caught it on video so they backed off because media was going into the
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.880]  woods and covering it because it's like a big turkey shoot hey we got women and
[15:00.880 --> 15:03.880]  kids in here let's shoot mama with a baby in her arms let's shoot a little
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.320]  kid in the back and because to these guys because these aren't real men these
[15:08.320 --> 15:11.640]  aren't soldiers these aren't these are people that it's like hunting these are
[15:11.640 --> 15:17.860]  arrested development wimps I've studied their mo these types who in just enjoy
[15:17.860 --> 15:22.480]  killing people but from a distance in a controlled way like Lon Horiuchi the
[15:22.480 --> 15:29.760]  sniper where they feel powerful and you see the culture of the drones and all of
[15:29.760 --> 15:35.440]  this and it totally dehumanizes everyone and and on the other side of it you've
[15:35.440 --> 15:39.960]  got the public running around saying kill the cops kill more great job
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.920]  Dorner team Dorner and all this garbage somebody ought to make an image of Obama
[15:44.920 --> 15:51.320]  in a jersey that has a zero on it and says team Dorner because he's anti-gun
[15:51.320 --> 15:56.060]  anti the citizens owning guns pro-government a total statist who was
[15:56.060 --> 16:02.200]  mad that he was thrown out of the cult and was going to show the cult to the
[16:02.200 --> 16:06.620]  feds hey I'm gonna give you trouble in a PR disaster I'm gonna throw a big giant
[16:06.620 --> 16:12.320]  temper tantrum I'm gonna go shoot a police captain's daughter and people are
[16:12.320 --> 16:16.480]  defending that so the police are turning into demons the public's turning into
[16:16.480 --> 16:22.080]  demons America accepts torture abortion secret arrest warrantless wiretapping
[16:22.080 --> 16:27.440]  injustice and now all the prosperity is going out the window all the liberties
[16:27.440 --> 16:32.240]  going out the window now our story we broke this yesterday as it was happening
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.060]  that clearly they cut the power they knew that place they talked to the
[16:36.060 --> 16:42.480]  owner they knew that that that that house did not that cabin did not have
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.800]  cable in it they knew they could cut the power with the power lines and it turns
[16:46.800 --> 16:52.360]  out they had cut the power okay they simply wanted to burn that thing down
[16:52.360 --> 16:55.920]  same thing at Waco they told the media okay you've been a mile away get back
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.800]  three miles so they had to have telephoto lenses what German film crew
[16:59.800 --> 17:04.960]  to even catch the compound burning that would have never even been seen until
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.960]  later okay the big wooden charts with a concrete building inside and but instead
[17:09.960 --> 17:12.920]  the FLIR footage got leaked by Patriots and the government didn't like what was
[17:12.920 --> 17:16.960]  happening they later killed the former CIA director over the league later died
[17:16.960 --> 17:20.520]  in his quote kayak remember that but I had the inside sources on where the
[17:20.520 --> 17:24.200]  FLIR came from then it was later confirmed to be the real FLIR and its
[17:24.200 --> 17:26.980]  infantry behind the armored vehicles going into the building behind it
[17:26.980 --> 17:31.400]  shooting the people setting the fires everything and it later came out in
[17:31.400 --> 17:37.120]  Congress Delta Force said quote we were ordered to go in and pull triggers so
[17:37.120 --> 17:41.960]  now we have the new clips from the news with San Bernardino on the open scanners
[17:41.960 --> 17:46.720]  saying burn that mother effort down burn it down we're gonna play that clip in a
[17:46.720 --> 17:51.080]  moment and then we have the actual scanner of the tank inside planting the
[17:51.080 --> 17:56.600]  fire bombs planting the fire bombs and they say okay we planted them we planted
[17:56.600 --> 18:02.180]  the burners now the fire is lit okay good job they're so arrogant now they
[18:02.180 --> 18:06.840]  cut the feed burn it down in front of you and then tell you they didn't burn
[18:06.840 --> 18:12.240]  it down and you watch they're gonna say Dorner burned it down Dorner burned it
[18:12.240 --> 18:16.280]  down I mean how many times to SWAT teams shoot their own officers and then frame
[18:16.280 --> 18:20.720]  the person's house they've come in it's a culture of they come first they're a
[18:20.720 --> 18:24.440]  gang and you're nobody now not all departments have succumbed to this but
[18:24.440 --> 18:29.320]  the big cities mainly have and it's it's despicable and and we know the threat to
[18:29.320 --> 18:32.480]  the public in North Korea is the police we know the threat to the public in
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.920]  Mexico's the police do we want our police to become like that because they

[24:14.440 --> 24:18.800]  already just joined us somebody breaking down Obama's incredibly chilling state
[24:18.800 --> 24:23.640]  of the Union what's really happening with the economy when he said hey if
[24:23.640 --> 24:27.120]  Congress doesn't act on carbon taxes which will totally shut us down which
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.040]  they're doing on purpose he said I'll do it on my own so Congress has got to
[24:32.040 --> 24:35.600]  start the impeachment process right now the problem is most of the leadership's
[24:35.600 --> 24:39.680]  bought and paid for this country is in deep deep trouble that's coming up in
[24:39.680 --> 24:42.680]  the next segment we're gonna open the phones up for your take on the Waco
[24:42.680 --> 24:47.340]  style barbecuing of Dorner of course they say they've found his body in the
[24:47.340 --> 24:52.440]  building but people are saying Alex how did you call this that you know they've
[24:52.440 --> 24:58.820]  cut the feed and it's probably so they can burn him out Waco style that's it's
[24:58.820 --> 25:02.520]  like how did I predict the Sun would come up this morning see that's what's
[25:02.520 --> 25:07.200]  so frustrating when you're awake you can call stuff about 90% of the time no
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.880]  exaggeration back more than that I just don't want to sound arrogant it's not
[25:11.880 --> 25:15.960]  arrogance this is the there's the real world and then there's what we're taught
[25:15.960 --> 25:20.800]  all day and there is almost no mainstream media there's a few LA
[25:20.800 --> 25:26.880]  articles going did the SWAT team said it what is it what is this audio mean it's
[25:26.880 --> 25:31.200]  kind of like when the UN officials a few weeks ago the people the UN funded
[25:31.200 --> 25:36.480]  controlled mandated communist Chinese put the baby behind the car the 13
[25:36.480 --> 25:39.800]  month-old baby that the parents had hid their second child and they run over it
[25:39.800 --> 25:45.080]  with a car and then the ABC News headline was
[25:45.800 --> 25:52.320]  baby run over in China by car with population control officials in it
[25:52.320 --> 25:59.000]  like not not population control tyrants run over baby it's like well a car ran
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.960]  over a baby and happen to have some population control officials in it this
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.840]  is how they spin everything so now we have the matrix being more and more
[26:06.840 --> 26:13.840]  obvious here of propaganda where they cut the feeds on the helicopters I've
[26:13.840 --> 26:17.620]  got reports where they quote ordered the local news but some of the local news
[26:17.620 --> 26:21.600]  didn't follow orders you see oh we better get rid of that First Amendment
[26:21.600 --> 26:26.280]  and still carried the audio and the local news and I've got the reports
[26:26.280 --> 26:30.840]  right here said hey it's audio of the scanners how do we know he doesn't have
[26:30.840 --> 26:35.160]  a scanner no we're going to run this and see they've scrambled most the scanners
[26:35.160 --> 26:38.760]  in the last few years it's gone to this federal system and they've unified the
[26:38.760 --> 26:42.580]  codes but still there's a lot of cops out there who were kind of having a you
[26:42.580 --> 26:46.660]  know a big pity party hysteria party who were so uncontrolled you know they're
[26:46.660 --> 26:50.560]  shooting up cars the wrong color do you imagine oh there's a white guy in a
[26:50.560 --> 26:54.040]  silver car let's shoot that up there's some women throwing newspapers out of a
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.600]  blue truck looks nothing like Dorners truck that's silver let's just shoot
[26:57.600 --> 27:07.080]  them up I mean that's that's Yosemite Sam level just and and this is the
[27:07.080 --> 27:11.560]  government that's got the helicopters the checkpoints the guns the weapons the
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.700]  surveillance it's why the founders said keep that government small keep it under
[27:16.700 --> 27:21.720]  control because governments like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful
[27:21.720 --> 27:24.720]  master and that's the terrorist of course George Washington that FEMA
[27:24.720 --> 27:28.800]  demonizes all day and I know police I've heard them all over talk radio and in
[27:28.800 --> 27:32.440]  the news all over the country they're marveling and how unprofessional the LAPD
[27:32.440 --> 27:37.920]  is but it's beyond that it's a bunch of crazy people I'm not saying they're all
[27:37.920 --> 27:44.600]  crazy but I mean just bad leadership unaccountable and then they they talk on
[27:44.600 --> 27:48.760]  the scanners okay you've broken through put the burners down and burn them up
[27:48.760 --> 27:53.140]  like we planned okay the burners are ignited the house is on fire I mean open
[27:53.140 --> 27:56.600]  and shut and you've got the cops outside running around screaming in front of
[27:56.600 --> 28:05.280]  news just just like totally turned over to rage because it's a cult it's like
[28:05.280 --> 28:10.540]  crying for Kim Jong-il when he died all the fake days of crying the more they
[28:10.540 --> 28:14.920]  show off and cry for the dead officer they just killed he just reportedly shot
[28:14.920 --> 28:19.240]  and I get it you know guy died it's what you signed on for I'm sad you're dead
[28:19.240 --> 28:22.520]  you get a great pension for your family you know you have a nice parade you
[28:22.520 --> 28:28.280]  signed on to be a tough guy okay hey you signed on to do this by frankly sounds
[28:28.280 --> 28:33.700]  pretty exciting to me I mean you you signed on for all this and people are
[28:33.700 --> 28:37.040]  gonna die I mean that's what you signed on for and I'm sad the cops dead but what
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.280]  about the citizens that are getting shot up and and so the police are freaking
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.000]  out screaming burn that mother ever you know we played the clip earlier we'll
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.160]  play it again but when we come back from break I'm gonna play the raw scanner
[28:50.160 --> 28:54.160]  which they admits theirs and I don't know how they're going to spin this this
[28:54.160 --> 29:02.120]  is from KC AL from the big LA station down the hill this is all police scanner
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.160]  audio directly off the news channels and it's the armored tank the wheel tank

[29:11.800 --> 29:14.520]  they hear a gunshot he probably killed himself
[29:14.520 --> 29:21.040]  Dorner and then they set the place on fire and burn the place up and people
[29:21.040 --> 29:25.680]  need to understand this is the default position okay they do this all the time
[29:25.680 --> 29:30.200]  there have been many cases of them burning out Patriots and people I mean
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.240]  if they know you're a veteran or they know you know how to use a gun they're
[29:33.240 --> 29:37.000]  not gonna go in to capture you and take you to trial and some could argue well
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.240]  he's already killed a bunch of people you know burn him out point is don't cut
[29:41.240 --> 29:45.120]  the feed burn it out and say you didn't do it okay stop treating us like we're

[34:16.160 --> 34:19.960]  be able to kill people you know I mean they're getting into it to go out and
[34:19.960 --> 34:24.240]  kill people where they can legally and lawfully kill people as psychopaths and
[34:24.240 --> 34:29.520]  I'd say 20% of cops are that type of person now and they've absolutely got to
[34:29.520 --> 34:32.920]  be removed but instead they're being put in positions of power but I want to get
[34:32.920 --> 34:35.720]  your take on Obama State of the Union and I haven't gotten to yet I'll play
[34:35.720 --> 34:39.520]  some clips in a moment and I want to get your take on what you saw yesterday but
[34:39.520 --> 34:45.840]  we've got a couple clips we're going to play now let's just get to the KC al
[34:45.840 --> 34:48.680]  clip we've already played then I'll get to the other clips I haven't played yet
[34:48.680 --> 34:54.800]  this is 51 second clip on the local TV station where they've got feeds from the
[34:54.800 --> 35:00.920]  ground with police running around screaming burn that house down bleep
[35:00.920 --> 35:07.640]  burn that mother bleep down and then we have the audio inside the tank back to
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.640]  the command post on the scanner on an open radio channel that's how dumb they
[35:12.640 --> 35:15.440]  think you are they're going to do something illegal they're going to
[35:15.440 --> 35:18.960]  purposely burn this guy up so they don't have to get killed taking him you know
[35:18.960 --> 35:23.000]  going in and taking him out or trying to get him to surrender they just want to
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.900]  get this over with okay clearly he was never going to surrender so I can see
[35:26.900 --> 35:30.480]  the psychology of that but
[35:30.960 --> 35:36.000]  still the media is compliantly turning off the feed so we couldn't see what
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.120]  really happened is the tank knocked down the walls and conveniently now they're
[35:41.120 --> 35:44.760]  saying oh never mind what you heard just go to sleep and it's the same on every
[35:44.760 --> 35:49.840]  other big issue or I see on the news we're going to blow up building 7 for
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.200]  the other building safety saw it on the news heard it on the radio have the
[35:54.200 --> 35:58.320]  clips cops saying get back we're blowing it up and I go hey they said they blew
[35:58.320 --> 36:00.800]  that up oh shut up you think the government did it you what do you work
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.840]  for bin Laden I'm like no criminal elements run al-qaeda and they're going
[36:04.840 --> 36:08.260]  to use al-qaeda to attack us to take our Liberty why'd they blow up building 7
[36:08.260 --> 36:11.800]  this needs to be investigated it didn't exist I'm like well I have the video
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.120]  clips never mind those children never mind and it's the same thing now never
[36:16.120 --> 36:21.040]  mind never mind never mind that you saw them cut the feed and then you have
[36:21.040 --> 36:24.160]  multiple audio clips of the police saying we're gonna burn him up and I'm
[36:24.160 --> 36:29.460]  gonna get to those right now just just forget you ever saw that and forget the
[36:29.460 --> 36:32.320]  dying Corps has been caught running kidnapped children on record and the UN
[36:32.320 --> 36:34.840]  has over and over again and you know forget the government's been caught
[36:34.840 --> 36:38.040]  shipping narcotics in over and over again and forget the NSA's warrantless
[36:38.040 --> 36:40.720]  Lee wiretapping you and forget that they're setting up warrantless
[36:40.720 --> 36:44.120]  checkpoints now searching your vehicles and forget the fact they're introducing
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.840]  legislation to physically confiscate your guns in multiple states and at the
[36:47.840 --> 36:51.080]  federal level just forget it forget the fact they're shutting down our power
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.640]  plants and raising our taxes to bankrupt us to bring us into government
[36:55.640 --> 37:00.040]  receivership forget all that forget agenda 21 everything's fine the
[37:00.040 --> 37:04.720]  government loves us they never lie to us it is this attitude that allows them to
[37:04.720 --> 37:09.300]  cut a feed torch a building say they're going to torch it and then there's no
[37:09.300 --> 37:15.280]  discussion about you just illegally killed somebody and we're all supposed
[37:15.280 --> 37:20.320]  to just play along with the lie now let's go to that clip we've already
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.880]  played and then to the new clips KC AL here it is
[37:24.880 --> 37:29.960]  Carter Evans it sounds like police officials were trying to move Carter out
[37:29.960 --> 37:35.040]  of the area into a safer area we do know that authorities were searching for a
[37:35.040 --> 37:38.960]  man in a Dodge pickup truck
[38:05.040 --> 38:10.960]  okay so that's when the gunfight was going on and you see fire you see smoke
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.480]  not just not just from firearms that went out live and then that was taped
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.360]  live off television and the media is trying to cover that up they were
[38:19.360 --> 38:24.360]  clearly trying to set the place on fire then okay and then this they wanted to
[38:24.360 --> 38:27.600]  be the heroes and set it on fire and burning out but they got driven back a
[38:27.600 --> 38:31.040]  couple of them got shot and remember he's down the hill earlier with a
[38:31.040 --> 38:34.520]  kidnapped couple he'd been there for days how do they know there weren't
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.080]  people inside the building now let's go to the next clip this is from the
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.520]  armored vehicle the wheeled tank that's rammed down three of the walls it's
[38:42.520 --> 38:50.200]  about to ram down the fourth wall and they are going to then quote place the
[38:50.200 --> 38:57.600]  burners the burners wonder what that means and then in case they can spin
[38:57.600 --> 39:02.680]  that oh well we don't mean we pull building seven or we don't mean you
[39:02.680 --> 39:08.400]  know burners mean burners they go okay burners ignited okay the fire is set
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.120]  sounds like pretty clear English to me like the right to keep and bear arms
[39:12.120 --> 39:16.280]  shall not be infringed all right I'm placing the burners all right the
[39:16.280 --> 39:20.280]  burners are ignited okay the fire is going I mean it's like hey honey we set
[39:20.280 --> 39:25.040]  a fire on the barbecue pistol and cook some stuff yeah I'm putting the coals in
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.000]  right now okay I've ignited it the fire is lit so let's go ahead and go to that
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  clip right now here it is
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.840]  we're not quite there I still have the two three corner that is all multiple
[40:34.840 --> 40:40.880]  tell far we're just bringing fire in about 200 yards out your call
[40:40.880 --> 40:47.120]  break 61 Lincoln 61 Charlie you ready for fire
[40:47.120 --> 41:00.720]  I still don't have adequate penetration on the 2-3 or the 3-4 and I still have wide ammo popping.
[41:00.720 --> 41:27.240]  all right they wanted to get to that basement and burn him out that was the
[41:27.240 --> 41:36.280]  main goal that was the main push that they were going for now we've got the
[41:36.280 --> 41:39.640]  police running around saying burn it burn up the house clearly trying to burn
[41:39.640 --> 41:43.640]  it up during the first firefight launching something at it whether it was
[41:43.640 --> 41:48.640]  the flammable type of tear gas rounds that are somewhat good at starting fires
[41:48.640 --> 41:51.480]  if you listen later we don't know what happened I mean almost sounds like they
[41:51.480 --> 41:54.920]  have flamethrowers I know a lot of the military terminology at least when I
[41:54.920 --> 41:59.600]  read about World War two was they would call flamethrowers burners they would go
[41:59.600 --> 42:03.760]  in and flamethrow people hiding in holes they go bring in burners maybe I mean
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.600]  I've heard the radio transmissions seen the documentaries they'd go you look
[42:08.600 --> 42:11.400]  this up in the terminology they'd say you know we're 500 yards out with a
[42:11.400 --> 42:15.280]  burner and that's military terminology I don't know if it's changed since Korea
[42:15.280 --> 42:18.720]  and Vietnam World War two but I mean it might have been a flamethrower for all
[42:18.720 --> 42:23.280]  we know the LAPD's got everything in the world and by the way the San Bernardino
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.680]  County and in Big Bear they were quote in charge the sheriff was in charge but
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.760]  it was the LAPD that was choppered in with the equipment there their vehicles
[42:32.760 --> 42:37.960]  brought in you know trucked in on 18 wheelers they were running the show sure
[42:37.960 --> 42:41.680]  the sheriff was in charge but he was like okay you're the quarterback go in
[42:41.680 --> 42:46.000]  there I almost went up the phones up for police and get their take on this but
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.880]  we'll do that after the first round of calls 800-259-9231
[42:50.880 --> 42:57.640]  800-259-9231 and we'll get your take on the Doerner situation a state of the
[42:57.640 --> 43:01.320]  Union that's the topic I don't screen your calls but when I say hey I want to
[43:01.320 --> 43:04.840]  hear from you on this that's what we're talking about so that's what I want to
[43:04.840 --> 43:07.200]  hear from you on I really want to hear what you have to say on those subjects
[43:07.200 --> 43:14.520]  800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air and we have a guest
[43:14.520 --> 43:18.680]  popping in on the hurricane and the aftermath of that a few months ago and
[43:18.680 --> 43:23.000]  then now this new winter storm and just how government isn't responding and is
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.720]  actually raising property taxes on people stuff we've got a guest on us
[43:25.720 --> 43:28.440]  for about 15 minutes at the bottom of the next hour but that's it the rest of
[43:28.440 --> 43:32.120]  the show is gonna be news and open phones today we've got a lot of other
[43:32.120 --> 43:35.640]  key clips we're gonna play from the whole state of the Union last night but
[43:35.640 --> 43:40.320]  for me this illustrates the absurdity of all of this now you can go see it
[43:40.320 --> 43:46.240]  timestamped at YouTube timestamped at info wars calm prison planet calm about
[43:46.240 --> 43:51.080]  two hours before they torched it as they were getting the armored vehicles off
[43:51.080 --> 43:55.360]  the 18 wheelers I saw that they said oh the police have asked it's
[43:55.360 --> 43:58.520]  unprecedented for them to cut the feed we've got a clip of that coming up with
[43:58.520 --> 44:02.080]  wolf blitzer and the other channels did it then they started demanding that the
[44:02.080 --> 44:06.520]  scanners be cut they're like well you can't see that he may have a scanner and
[44:06.520 --> 44:11.680]  most news did a few did and that's how we had those clips you just heard I mean
[44:11.680 --> 44:14.440]  I guess they just think they're God now they order the media to stand down so
[44:14.440 --> 44:17.880]  they can do whatever so that and again this guy you can say he was bad if he
[44:17.880 --> 44:20.600]  was guilty and a lot of evidence points that direction but do you want to be
[44:20.600 --> 44:22.960]  surrounded to have your house burned down and they just say you were a child
[44:22.960 --> 44:27.360]  killer corrupt governments will frame people and our government's been caught
[44:27.360 --> 44:31.960]  framing people and major crime labs the LAPD crime lab the Houston crime lab the
[44:31.960 --> 44:37.280]  FBI crime lab the San Francisco crime lab the Dallas crime lab almost every
[44:37.280 --> 44:41.640]  crime lab if you look up the name of your major city crime lab scandal you
[44:41.640 --> 44:48.560]  you'll see people being framed I mean I was exposing police stealing drugs where
[44:48.560 --> 44:52.400]  I grew up in Rockwall Texas and they called me in the office and said we're
[44:52.400 --> 44:57.840]  gonna say you stole stereo equipment out of some trailer park and I said I'd have
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.840]  never sold anything but a but beer out of people's golf carts when I and there
[45:02.840 --> 45:07.940]  the cops like look I know that you're gonna be raped and given AIDS and he
[45:07.940 --> 45:12.600]  said some other things racist stuff and then slammed my head down in the thing
[45:12.600 --> 45:15.520]  and said you know you basically you're dead if you don't shut up and then my
[45:15.520 --> 45:19.320]  dad got the word they were gonna kill me if we didn't move we moved to Austin
[45:19.320 --> 45:23.880]  Texas because of this I have experienced a cop sitting there going up we know you
[45:23.880 --> 45:26.280]  stole that stereo equipment we're gonna get you for that if you don't shut up
[45:26.280 --> 45:30.160]  about the other trouble you've been causing and you're like I don't still
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.160]  anything in years I think I've stole beer on people's golf carts stand up
[45:34.160 --> 45:38.400]  stand up right here for me slam my head in the thing listen you little you know
[45:38.400 --> 45:42.240]  the whole thing was spit dripping out of his mouth so I have experienced it and I
[45:42.240 --> 45:47.000]  was just like stop pulling us over and trying to search for drugs when we're a
[45:47.000 --> 45:53.160]  bunch of you know crap-kicking jock you know cowboy hat wearing beer drinkers
[45:53.160 --> 45:57.440]  stop saying we're doing drugs when you're the ones selling them boys I'm
[45:57.440 --> 46:03.320]  already digressing I just the public is so naive ladies and gentlemen the public
[46:03.320 --> 46:10.600]  is so absolutely naive they have no idea no idea what's really going on in this
[46:10.600 --> 46:15.860]  country and that's why we're being absolutely robbed and now some people
[46:15.860 --> 46:19.280]  are awake but their answer is just kill all the police we've seen that all over
[46:19.280 --> 46:22.680]  the news like the knees like well I guess Dorner did have a point perhaps he
[46:22.680 --> 46:27.240]  is good and yeah you know go Dorner kill more cops yeah let's just randomly kill
[46:27.240 --> 46:32.320]  cops I mean you're you're you're light years worse than these police and it
[46:32.320 --> 46:38.560]  just shows a society absolutely falling apart absolutely falling apart killing
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.760]  the police isn't going to do anything but get a civil war going most police
[46:42.760 --> 46:46.560]  are good men and women most departments are revenue generating they don't know
[46:46.560 --> 46:49.400]  they're designed to ruin the economy they don't know why people hate them
[46:49.400 --> 46:52.080]  because they want the money to pay these tickets I mean I was talking to one of
[46:52.080 --> 46:55.000]  my crew he was up there dealing with a ticket he saw poor families and stuff
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.240]  you know two three thousand dollar stuff on tickets and things now they've jacked
[46:58.240 --> 47:02.080]  up in Texas and the people turn around and cry because that's that's the
[47:02.080 --> 47:05.800]  that's the grocery money folks I mean this country's in a depression and
[47:05.800 --> 47:11.280]  they're just squeezing and so even quote good cops have an evil job now because
[47:11.280 --> 47:14.400]  the government's evil you have an evil mission I don't care what propaganda you
[47:14.400 --> 47:19.680]  put on it but they're not individually evil and we want to avoid the civil war
[47:19.680 --> 47:23.120]  if you know they start coming for people and stuff it's the gloves are off and
[47:23.120 --> 47:29.360]  it's gonna be a million times I mean way more than million times Dorner that's
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.560]  why the system is gonna stage stuff to get the psychological war one to blame
[47:33.560 --> 47:37.240]  anyone that resists as terrorists but the system should look the public hates
[47:37.240 --> 47:43.600]  you so much they're wanting the public to kill your children I mean and that's
[47:43.600 --> 47:46.800]  why I don't want a revolution a lot of times revolutions create something worse
[47:46.800 --> 47:51.080]  than what you had I want the Republic back I want due process back I want
[47:51.080 --> 47:56.920]  honorable behavior back I want to put this monster back in the cage okay
[47:56.920 --> 48:00.760]  believe me I got a family I've studied history I'm getting chills right now
[48:00.760 --> 48:05.440]  this country's on the edge of a powder keg and the government's gearing up for
[48:05.440 --> 48:08.880]  checkpoints martial law you know to crush the resistance once it starts
[48:08.880 --> 48:13.040]  they're gonna start the resistance you idiots out there in law enforcement
[48:13.040 --> 48:16.660]  maybe you're not as naive as the public but you still don't get the trap you're
[48:16.660 --> 48:19.280]  being set up for
[48:19.600 --> 48:23.960]  let's go out to break with my prediction I'm not gonna play the whole thing but
[48:23.960 --> 48:26.240]  where I play the wolf bloods are in the rest of it let's go ahead and go to the
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.120]  clip that's up at info wars calm here it is two hours before they torched him the
[48:30.120 --> 48:35.800]  Chris Dorner fiasco appears to be coming to a head Alex Jones with info wars calm
[48:35.800 --> 48:40.680]  news alert we were just in here watching CNN they claim that they've cornered him
[48:40.680 --> 48:45.560]  in some house there's been some type of shootout in Big Bear California up in
[48:45.560 --> 48:50.760]  the snow-capped mountains the issue here though is that now CNN especially
[48:50.760 --> 48:55.720]  refuses to show live footage and it's just telling us what they're seeing from
[48:55.720 --> 49:00.720]  the helicopter in the past this was never done except for situations like
[49:00.720 --> 49:04.640]  Waco where they ordered the news cameras back and then the place blew up in
[49:04.640 --> 49:10.560]  flames he's reportedly got several hostages inside there what the police
[49:10.560 --> 49:13.360]  tend to do and the military tends to do the situation like this where they've
[49:13.360 --> 49:18.000]  lost some of their own they don't care about 17 little children under the age
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.440]  of 10 in the Waco compound they blew it up and burned to the ground and I hope
[49:22.440 --> 49:26.240]  that doesn't happen here but regardless this is why people don't believe
[49:26.240 --> 49:29.840]  official stories it's because over and over again we're gonna play the clip in
[49:29.840 --> 49:34.080]  a moment the establishment media is caught lying about things spinning
[49:34.080 --> 49:37.080]  things and they're not letting us see what's really happening a few weeks ago
[49:37.080 --> 49:40.880]  at a shooting in Houston at a community college they cut the feed and we're
[49:40.880 --> 49:45.440]  saying different things than what we were watching on local Texas television
[49:45.440 --> 49:48.720]  with live feeds they kept showing the scariest footage over and over again
[49:48.720 --> 49:53.640]  they also do that to control the narrative and what's put out but here's
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.200]  the bottom line we have our guns because of government people like the alleged

[54:31.040 --> 54:35.120]  the crew found some and economic development zones taking over the

[54:49.000 --> 54:54.760]  a moment during the break I was looking at this again it's just making my head
[54:54.760 --> 54:59.560]  spin I mean it's it's it's all happening I mean they're burning up people alive
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.560]  and saying they didn't in front of us let's burn him up okay but we didn't
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.080]  burn him up I mean it it's reached cuckoo level and I've got the economic

[55:13.620 --> 55:19.240]  opinion this is so diabolical and I just want prosperity but see they don't want

[56:38.760 --> 56:42.320]  vehicle around on the walls and set it on fire just reminds me of Waco makes me
[56:42.320 --> 56:47.120]  so angry one thing to kill this guy you can debate that all day but man I tell

[56:58.440 --> 57:01.400]  now but police out there here's the number so after you hear somebody hang
[57:01.400 --> 57:06.880]  up you can get in it's 800 to 5 at 9 9 2 3 1 let's play this chilling clip of
[57:06.880 --> 57:10.280]  Obama saying he'll do whatever he wants if Congress doesn't bring in the UN
[57:10.280 --> 57:14.600]  carbon tax here it is now the good news is we can make meaningful progress on
[57:14.600 --> 57:19.920]  this issue while driving strong economic growth I urge this Congress to get
[57:19.920 --> 57:23.200]  together pursue a bipartisan market-based solution to climate change
[57:23.200 --> 57:26.680]  like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few
[57:26.680 --> 57:34.360]  years ago but if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations I will I
[57:34.360 --> 57:41.920]  will direct I will direct my cabinet to come up with executive actions we can
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.720]  take now and in the future to reduce pollution prepare our communities for
[57:46.720 --> 57:51.280]  the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable
[57:51.280 --> 57:54.180]  sources of energy that means shutting down our power plants and then giving
[57:54.180 --> 57:56.360]  boondoggles the energy companies that don't exist
[57:56.360 --> 57:59.960]  millions of dollars to their friends this is a mafia I don't care if they
[57:59.960 --> 58:02.760]  land in Air Force One helicopters I don't care they're wearing fancy suits
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.960]  and green ribbons for Sandy Hook for what they probably did you know the
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.520]  issue is we're in trouble and the globalists have built China up as the
[58:11.520 --> 58:15.200]  new command base they have no standards or regulations on them we have them
[58:15.200 --> 58:19.600]  piled on us it's over it'd be like playing a football field where one team
[58:19.600 --> 58:23.920]  is up on the mountain with a Gatling gun and and you've got rocks and stones and
[58:23.920 --> 58:26.640]  you've got to go up and beat them when they've got a machine gun at the top of
[58:26.640 --> 58:30.920]  the hill I mean it's that slanted but if we wake up to the scam we can just say
[58:30.920 --> 58:34.600]  wait this is all a giant fraud but instead it's all about how he's gonna
[58:34.600 --> 58:40.680]  get you jobs what Obama's gonna do is put you on welfare to run your life
[58:42.920 --> 58:53.160]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network you prepare by purchasing

[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.920]  Alex Jones
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.960]  all right we're taking your calls in the shower we're gonna recap the Dorner
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.800]  Waco torching and the government thinking we're so dumb they admit on the
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.800]  scanners they burned him up try to deny it we're going to Obama State of the
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.520]  Union and as I said take your phone calls and a bunch of news on the economy
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.160]  that's bone-chilling but again knowing about this and understanding it's
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:52.000]  premeditated is half the battle sandy in Wisconsin you're on the air thanks for
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.320]  holding yeah Alex I just gotta say I want the officers to know my son-in-law
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.560]  was an officer up until maybe seven months ago because his captain came in
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.320]  it was a new military guy he saw changes coming but we need to let these officers
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.760]  know don't leave we need the good ones in there we you know they're gonna get
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:16.440]  scared they don't like the changes but the more good ones we get in there the
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.080]  more they can change these well it's not just the military guys are sending in to
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.040]  command them are bad they're getting the bad guys out of the military they were
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.280]  psychos just want to kill people they're putting them in charge yeah I mean they're
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.240]  all the look and everything they had to do now was a complete change well it's
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.880]  all meant to intimidate people and instead it's getting the public thinking
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.040]  it's an occupying army and wanting to like white blood cells to attack the
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.320]  invader and then last night a bunch of us were watching you know the president
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.280]  and of course Gerald Cilenti my other hero next to you was tweeting back and
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.160]  forth with some of us on Facebook and things and all I kept thinking is if
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:57.060]  before Hitler could have gotten his hands on anybody if we would have had
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.040]  the system we have now to get information out it probably wouldn't
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:07.240]  have happened but I'm afraid if Obama gets the internet control we will lose
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:12.640]  this battle very quickly I absolutely agree with you
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:15.840]  well get Obama's there is the puppet who's supposed to bring in the change
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.080]  then he takes all the blame so the globalist in case they lose this round
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.960]  don't don't get in trouble but but it's important to politically shoot down
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.680]  Obama's agenda as well because that's what they're rolling this through on but
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.240]  you've got to understand it's just the latest salvo the latest missile coming
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:36.800]  in that our Aegis or Aegis system has to shoot down we need to understand there's
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.520]  a command ship launching these these people at us thank you for the call
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.840]  sandy Abby in Pennsylvania you're on the air
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:53.440]  hi Alex I had an well what do you think I was saying about the Dorna case with
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.960]  the wallet they found apparently found it close to Mexico on the side of the
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.400]  road and then all of a sudden they find it in the building after it burns down I
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.400]  mean I think that's kind of coincidental that they find his wallet sure there's
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.560]  about maybe there's a 5% chance this could be a state psi op it's just that
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:17.120]  it's so bad for them and it shows how pathetically weak they are to to
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:22.520]  asymmetrical resistance such a PR disaster and shooting up innocent
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.680]  people's cars let me tell you I mean just all the mo of this looks like it's
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:33.240]  real I was also reading online I found a few news things online that were saying
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.800]  that the manifesto that he made was actually altered and changed there's two
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.560]  different versions of it he was putting it on Facebook and other sites I mean
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:48.480]  listen listen I've read Fruit Loop narcissist tough guy stuff this is if he
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:55.240]  didn't write this the person deserves a Nobel Prize in literature saying that
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.320]  he's innocent or guilty I'm just saying I think it's kind of funny that all this
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.360]  contradiction stuff is coming out and it's blatantly obvious I mean it's like
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.320]  they're not even trying to cover it up anymore
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.920]  no nobody oh oh he did it oh he's a bad guy go kill him and stuff and then they
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.800]  open up the investigation to appease him I mean no I won't see that was to make
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.880]  it look like because they make him a bad guy welcome the bad guy be winning so
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.920]  they just went with the political correctness because he's an Obama
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.960]  supporter and an anti-gun guy the media was kind of like well maybe he is good
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.560]  then you know cuz cuz see once they fully take over they're gonna hang the

[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:43.640]  the area of where Dorner was reportedly torched Waco style yesterday who know
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.160]  people that were right in the very vicinity so they're there today doing an
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.680]  investigation we'll have some of those folks on like dr. Cory gold tomorrow who
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.180]  lives in the area to break that down with us we'd have them on today but he's
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:02.640]  in the area investigating right now so he'll be joining us tomorrow so we don't
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.160]  go off so we don't go off half-cocked and Joseph Farah is on tomorrow to talk
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:12.280]  about his prediction of just Obama going hog-wild with carbon taxes police state
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.400]  cybersecurity that's all tomorrow as well you know I've got these clips and
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.680]  and we're gonna cover this mainly in the next hours I wanna go to calls right now
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.440]  where Obama you know said hey if Congress doesn't bring in carbon taxes
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.440]  I'm gonna do it with executive orders and he's really trying to sell the
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.480]  dictator angle to try to get that out there if I'll get the economy going just
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:37.600]  let me be a dictator very very serious and they've got so many reasons to
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:43.840]  impeach him already putting our troops under UN control NATO control trying to
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.280]  keep cybersecurity orders secret from Congress saying they have no authority
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.940]  this is just all fast and furious totally impeachable why is it not
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:58.080]  happening now I got loaded phones here after we go to these five or six callers
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.560]  that are on the top of the board I want to leave the new phone lines that are
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.660]  open for police current police who'd like to call in or form or whatever to
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:11.240]  give us your take on what we've seen the LAPD shooting up innocent vehicles and
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.560]  people that are a white guy in a car doesn't match the description shoot it
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.760]  up imagine being a black guy in a similar truck I mean you don't deserve
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:24.640]  to die women you know white women in a blue truck different make-model different
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:30.640]  company shoot them up and then the audio caught live on the news of the scanner
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.440]  them saying burn it down burn the mother effort down I'm gonna play a clip of
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.680]  that in a moment and then the actual scanner audio they asked the news to cut
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.080]  but one of them didn't this is confirmed where they bring in the armored vehicle
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.920]  knock down the walls and then say okay we got the fire we're gonna bring the
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.640]  fire in okay set the burners they're ignited the place is on fire I mean they
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:55.120]  way code it now I'm glad there weren't 17 little children in there and and I'm
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.920]  no fan of this guy but I mean the due process out the window and now we'll
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.480]  never know the truth I mean I tend to see the manifesto the witnesses to what
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.160]  he was doing the phone calls made I mean it sounds like it's a real story a real
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.840]  rogue you know sometimes things are real they're not staged the way it's all a PR
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.120]  disaster you know shows you that's probably not staged when they stage
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.880]  something they've got their ducks in a row like Aurora definitely staged I mean
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.000]  my goodness the guy got DARPA funding Department of Defense was over that guy
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.200]  five different psychotropics witnesses of other people said he was under mind
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.400]  control it's been declassified Surin Surin was under mind control I mean you
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.060]  know this stuff's all coming out but this is very suspicious I want to play
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:39.560]  these clips again and go to your phone calls for people that are holding like
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:44.480]  Ron in New York former police officer Robert in Florida Bobby Jason many
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:49.360]  others that are patiently holding right now the toll-free number for police to

[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.440]  forget which one I forget the call there so I'm getting old and they were all
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.680]  talking about them burning it down when I tuned in stuck in traffic for like an
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:48.080]  hour this morning really bad traffic but side issue it was all drudge that's why

[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.320]  and then they run over to the reporter and tell him get out of the area police
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:41.840]  officers understandably upset and again that was a live and a little listener
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.880]  there in the area shot it off the video off the TV they don't want this stuff
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.120]  being seen now here is the official scanner they wanted cut but didn't get
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.160]  cut here is the armored vehicle knocking down the walls and setting it on fire
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.280]  bombshell that they would do this in front of everyone and you watch it'll
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.880]  never even be an issue you're a conspiracy I guarantee you there will be
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:07.120]  articles out by this afternoon if not now I have a check saying Matt drudge is
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.520]  crazy Alex Jones is crazy you know it's a conspiracy theory that that they burn
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.000]  this down guarantee doesn't matter you got them they burn it down boom they're
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.040]  gonna again if you said two plus two equal four they'd say you were
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.200]  conspiracy theorist if you know how to tie your shoelaces you're a conspiracy
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.720]  theorist you watch Obama shutting down power plants every week everybody going
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.880]  bankrupt our power prices going up say that's bad for the economy you're
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.320]  conspiracy terrorist if you got common sense you're conspiracy theorist well
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:59.720]  welcome to conspiracy theory let's go ahead and go to the next clip here it is
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:34.280]  the unedited audio is a bunch of it is up and in full or start
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.320]  com right now in the article
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:42.320]  police audio from donor siege burned this mother bleep all right we're gonna
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.120]  go ahead with the plan with the burners and we cut the spaces out of that for
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.160]  radio you know here where where the guys going okay place the burners just like
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:57.080]  we talked about in private yes place the burners do it we ought to just air the
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.680]  whole thing I mean it's so ridiculous and if they would do this I think we
[01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:04.240]  don't know what's going on okay we'll go to Ron in New York former police officer
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.800]  Mr. Ron I know he's been giving us great info for about 13 years we got to move
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:12.800]  quick Ron what's your take on this whole situation with daughter I thought it's
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.000]  strange they now said you know there's always weird things every time something
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.840]  like this happens it never adds up the connects right they said that they found
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.000]  his driver's license near his body now first off how could a driver's license
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.960]  survive that inferno second off why would a guy who didn't care less about
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.400]  murdering a number of people like a good citizen carries driver's license around
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.440]  like he was afraid that he was you know gonna get stopped for a speeding ticket
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.240]  and even if by some chance he had his driver's license most people tend to
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:45.040]  keep it on them in their back pocket yet they said they found it according to
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.140]  these reports today near his body in the inferno wreckage which doesn't make
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:54.600]  sounds like 9-11 where two passports survived the fireballs made to the
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.800]  ground and were found that day by the FBI it does sound a lot like that and
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:02.680]  plus did you notice another thing here an irony that they finished doing her
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.360]  off just about a half hour before the State of the Union address like as
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.960]  though they didn't want it to overshadow the State of the Union offering or
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.760]  something yeah but I mean here's the deal this is a PR disaster for them the
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.040]  cops shooting up innocent people and things the kind of narcissism and the
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.560]  letters I mean my gut tells me that at least a large portion of this is real
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.640]  I decided because something happened which doesn't happen that often but one
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:33.200]  of their own one of the inside is went rogue a loose cannon and of course that
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.320]  threw them off balance how do you deal with something like that it takes a while
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.240]  to adjust to it and I think that's what happened but you know Alex getting to
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.640]  another thing too on another issue with the State of the Union did you notice
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.440]  that that person John Bonney supposed to be pro-gun right yet when Obama's
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:54.280]  mentioned gun control he stood on his feet and chapped and clapped yeah and
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.800]  John McCain was wearing the ribbons and everything and having little snicker
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:04.240]  doodle times it's a bunch of disgusting people you know and also like there was
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:08.720]  an article in USA Today with Wayne LaPierre hopping on an issue that's very
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.160]  similar to the issue with veterans where out of one side of his mouth he says in
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:17.000]  the past that's no good in recent past now he's hopping on that and he's kind
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.800]  of intimating that that is good you know something we not only have enemies to
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.800]  the front of us that are clearly definable on the Second Amendment but I
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.320]  think we better be very careful as to who we got to the back of a well you know
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.360]  he's always been anti-gun at its core but good folks have tried to take it
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.640]  back over but you're absolutely right got a jump gonna hear from you Ron let's
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.160]  talk to Robert who's a retired police officer what's your take on this
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:47.240]  situation Robert I'm not retired I just didn't I just didn't want to finish out
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:51.400]  my term there things are just getting a little bit too political and too heated
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.240]  for my cup of tea so I'm just curious so what happened with the marshal yesterday
[01:18:54.240 --> 01:19:01.240]  they came in what did he want oh yeah they wanted a source on a story with
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.760]  Marines saying that this reported shooter of Chris Kyle a sniper had not
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.600]  not been in combat and then I called him and said you never came back and he said
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:17.520]  no we were able to actually confirm that through Marines separately so our story
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.840]  helped them go confirm with other Marines in the unit that indeed the guy
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.480]  wasn't a combat marine he was assigned to a mechanics detail so they just want
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:30.160]  that so they can try to give him a lethal injection instead of him getting
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:34.760]  off on PTSD I mean the whole thing's very suspicious and I wanted to
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.120]  interrogate the Texas Ranger but he said he was very polite he goes no sir I
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.000]  can't talk to you now my superiors say click so believe me I wish I would have
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.440]  gotten a chance to talk to him as I answer your question come back to you

[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.840]  places two different times now I I get the fact that the system almost always
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.280]  lies even when the truth would serve them I just don't see why they'd stage
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.840]  this when it's a PR disaster but who knows they burned up whoever it is in
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:39.840]  that house it's like John Wilkes booth got burned up in the barn the guy that
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.160]  supposedly shot Lincoln and we know he had accomplices so I mean it's just
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:52.160]  they always burn them up so is this a conspiracy to I just don't know anymore
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.560]  all I know is Obama is up there on television saying if Congress doesn't
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:03.840]  put carbon taxes and he's gonna do it unbelievable
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:12.200]  Jessica in California says she has info covered not covered in the media there
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.680]  we're gonna get her info a minute finish up your point Robert the point you
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.520]  wanted to make about the whole Dorner situation situation just disgust me I
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.400]  mean well you know like like you said earlier we live in a country where
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:27.660]  there's no more due process and no more do anything it's just you know do what
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:31.840]  you want and how the dictator can stand up in front of everybody and say okay
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.800]  I'm gonna do this if you don't do this I mean I don't understand why he's not
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.520]  being impeached being arrested I mean this is when I talk to people and I try
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.920]  to spread the word about you and what's going on you know that you know yes you
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.840]  know they laugh and say you can spit that I tell you know this is supposed to
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.320]  be the future what's supposed to have jet cars by now my rails to the moon yet
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:56.480]  here we are on the verge of 1776 back in the dark ages and the whole thing just
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:01.040]  disgust me and how the government is shutting down our power plants that
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:06.280]  supply 52% of our power and the economy is going into a tailspin by design and
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:10.680]  these people think it's funny what do you make of them torching the compound
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:17.320]  torching the house the can't even get it right the going back to Waco the cabin
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:21.120]  and then telling us they didn't torch it when they're on tape two different clips
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.480]  saying they're gonna torch it well it's like you said 90% of the population is
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.920]  stupid they're gonna say all that didn't happen what are you talking about even
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.800]  if you played a video or play the audio they're gonna say oh that's just a
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:36.880]  Photoshop no matter what you do they're gonna say oh it's just a splice
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.000]  together thing it ain't real and they're just so dumbed down and it's just
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.080]  exactly and it allows the criminals in government to take over and push out the
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.440]  good people and then you get tyranny god bless you good to hear from you let's
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.960]  go to Jessica says she has info not covered concerning a Dorner and the car
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.760]  site where he burned up his car Jessica what can you tell us um yeah I was just
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:03.800]  calling because the day before all this happened up the street I literally lived
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:07.600]  down the street from where it was but up the street there was a controlled burn
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.160]  the fire department had signs and stuff but I just thought it was a weird time
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:16.360]  of year to do that considering we have snow right now and it was very small and
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:22.000]  it was in the same area where his car was found the next morning and yeah I
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.240]  just thought I would let you guys know I just thought it was really weird well
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.400]  you know I've got to really rack my brain and analyze this why would they
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:36.000]  stage this again my gut says it's real the evidence all points there but then
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.720]  there's a lot of evidence pointing towards cover-up and is it just that
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.960]  cops want to be heroes so they plant fake passports or they say they found a
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.440]  driver's license at the Mexican border and now they found it in the cabin and
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.560]  how did it survive and and it just goes on and on it's just like there's so much
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:56.900]  lying who knows what the truth is yeah that's exactly my point like the media
[01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:00.920]  hasn't been reporting on any of this and they in fact one of the houses near mine
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:07.520]  got raided the day that his truck was found up here and they said that the
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.440]  door was left open and it's in a pretty busy neighborhood there's been traffic
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:17.520]  up and down all day because of the resort and whatnot and it I don't I
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.760]  don't know it's just they raided the house and nothing was found they walked
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.200]  away laughing and he was hiding in the house directly across the street 100
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:30.000]  yards away from them the whole time well one of people out in Southern California
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.480]  think of the police shooting up two vehicles that didn't even match the
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:38.880]  description I feel like that's been kind of brushed under the table I feel like
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.280]  the news makes it not seem as big of a deal as but I mean how do you hire
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:47.440]  people so trigger-happy so crazy I mean I've heard of people that you take dear
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:51.680]  hunting their first time they get butt fever and they see a cow 300 yards away
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.280]  and somebody else's property and they shoot cows you see it the news all the
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.200]  time and and it's like well you didn't know that was a cows in the middle of a
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:03.080]  field well I just didn't look like a deer I thought I I thought I and the
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.360]  truth is they're just crazy people and you've got weirdos that want to be tough
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.880]  guy heroes who go and become police now and they have no business do I mean it
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:19.800]  is crazy it is crazy I mean I've had cops pull me over and they start asking
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:25.560]  me questions about PCP and guns and this I'm just like leave me alone man you
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.040]  know what I mean come on you know you just pulled me over I don't have any
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:31.720]  record stop acting like you're you know how about I go search your car
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.600]  because statistically you're more criminal than anybody else okay I mean
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.320]  it's true look at criminology there are more criminals in government and in law
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.160]  enforcement than any other area cuz smart criminals want the badge and the
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.200]  gun to be able to protect themselves governments who you've got to control

[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.400]  the globalists don't think that you're gonna go along with this they'll back
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:59.720]  off on the implosion but right now they're going ahead with it and Obama

[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.880]  third hour coming up he's saying hey if Congress doesn't act on the carbon taxes
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.760]  which will destroy us selectively enforced on the US and Europe all the
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:18.120]  jobs that are left to leave if we don't do that if we don't go along with that
[01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:23.320]  he'll just do it by executive power I mean there's a name for that it's called
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.680]  dictatorship and even if Obama leaves office later the office of the president

[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:02.760]  the worst ladies and gentlemen but hope for the best and of course the famous
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.800]  saying is hope for the best prepare for the worst this is happening because we
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:12.880]  haven't been distrustful we haven't been been paranoid we've been overrun the
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:17.800]  founders said if you fight as hard as you can you'll probably lose Liberty the
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.680]  founders said you can try to protect the jewel of Liberty with everything you've
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.440]  got you might not be able to keep it thank you probably can't Thomas
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.560]  Jefferson said that George Washington said that in some more words look it up
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.960]  and but they said if you don't fight for it you're gonna get a tyranny out of
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:34.400]  control they said that Thomas Jefferson in a letter who was he writing to John
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.240]  Adams John Adams and he said well what will the what will the level be that man
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:43.200]  puts up with he was marveling and he said it'll be the level you put up with
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.000]  whatever you accept that's what you'll live under don't you get it folks when
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.280]  you bend over wolves are coming I mean if you went out in the middle of the
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:57.000]  frozen tundra of northern Canada and and and played varmint tapes of dying baby
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.320]  rabbits big wolves would come and they would kill you and eat you but if you
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:05.960]  stood up and you know how to spear they'd run in fear
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.920]  government
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:15.200]  is being totally filled with criminals right now worldwide we got cancer we
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.720]  gotta cut it out okay people don't be so negative it's not negative we got to do
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:23.680]  something about this right now now I want to play this clip that we're going
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:31.800]  to our guest this is a new clip backing up the earlier clip that was on the
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:36.120]  local San Bernardino TV station where they say get the fire we're gonna burn
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.360]  it down burn him down then we have the SWAT team actually with the tank saying
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:43.880]  get ready to burn it down this is a third clip CBS News another clip where
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:48.400]  they're running around in front of reporters who they hadn't run off yet
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.320]  this isn't even on scanners who've got those you know shotgun mics that go out
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:57.280]  a hundred yards with the cops going get the gas get the gas and that's why there
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:00.040]  was fires earlier they tried to burn it down earlier then they got a tank up
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.560]  there to do it gotta say they actually had some courage they're trying to kill
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:09.320]  the cat ago get the gasoline up there themselves so here is the CBS clip I
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:12.640]  mean it's open and shut they burn this thing now this is three clips now here
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.840]  it is
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.680]  all right again we apologize for the expletives this is live coverage a gun
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:44.120]  battle we believe with Christopher Dorner going on right now in Big Bear
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.800]  okay ladies and gentlemen the media last night this morning was calling it a
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.120]  conspiracy theory just said that they burned it down now CNN is asking what
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.600]  does the audio mean so we forced the dinosaur media again to cover something
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.760]  now ladies and gentlemen I wanted to get him on last week but he was too busy to
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.480]  join us we're thankful that he's here with us today he does happen to be a
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:15.400]  sponsor but that's not why he's on the air with us Steve shank of the Jay

[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.480]  letting people rebuild they're raising property taxes from Hurricane Sandy and
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:29.440]  now with the Nemo storm people are still without power and government is trying
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.880]  to harass them and using it as a power grab and how it ties into the Greek food
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:37.840]  brawl that we're now seeing with hundreds and hundreds trying to battle
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:42.040]  to get radishes and things that fell off a truck shades of Argentina and why is
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.120]  the government gearing up for that here I have some articles breaking down all
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:50.160]  of that today and I wanted to get Steve shank on to the end of the hour that I
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.840]  promise we're going right to Mike Bobby Jason Carl and others and I want to hear
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.040]  from police on their take of what's happened but first before we talk about
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.160]  geopolitically what's going on with Steve shank as a philosopher educator
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.680]  noted food expert and 30-plus year I mean the father of modern storeable
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.560]  foods everybody else claims they're him he's the real deal everybody says that

[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:34.440]  and and Steve shank joins us here today Steve what is your take on Chris Dorner
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:38.000]  and the police shooting up innocent people's cars that didn't even match it
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.960]  and just government going crazy but the public going crazy too I mean it's like
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.880]  half the people on YouTube and and I'm getting threats over this going hey kill
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:53.080]  the pigs family kill kill kill kill Alex he doesn't want to kill the pigs I mean
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.760]  the cops are turning into demons the people are turning into demons this is
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:59.320]  like Sodom and Gomorrah what's going on here
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:04.240]  well very simply we've talked about it and talked about it for years together
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:12.280]  Alex and the fact is is that when people function from a position of fear you
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:19.200]  cannot predict their behavior you have mob psychology which very simply is not
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:26.440]  sane what has to happen now you know you you talk all the time about people
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:30.640]  listening people getting the information people getting familiar with what's
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:37.160]  going on and there's one step further that they have to take but unfortunately
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:43.640]  you and I can't get them to do it on our own we can't fix anybody here's the law
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:51.280]  for evil men to win all it takes is for good men to do nothing
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.920]  having said that it doesn't do any good to have all of this information that you
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:04.120]  and I have been disseminating for years and do nothing about it but if every
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.800]  individual you know one of the most one of the most heart-rending messages that
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.560]  I've ever gotten was after you and I were on a show together and that was
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:18.600]  when a little gal emailed us and said you know what when you talked about
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:25.480]  looking in the mirror every morning and say if it is to be is it up to me and if
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:31.840]  every individual every American took responsibility for becoming independent
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:38.960]  then the country would take care of itself if our people are not dependent
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:46.000]  if they have enough food even if they don't have someplace to stay they can't
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.680]  be in a situation where they have to be dependent like the Greeks those people
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:56.520]  would not be rioting if every one of them had a year's supply of food for
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:01.760]  their family in their homes they could stay in their homes and the the only
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:06.960]  ones that would be rioting out there are the ones that are dependent and have to
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:12.040]  go and say please somebody else take care of me the victims are the only ones
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:16.800]  that are out there having problems you know one of the principles that you and
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:23.200]  I've talked about several times is if you're prepared you can turn a disaster
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:26.480]  into an adventure now I'm not saying that this thing was
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:33.360]  dormer out there is a is a potential adventure but the mob psychology the
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:38.600]  fear and the anxiety and the running hither and yon just decided to do
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:45.000]  something shows lack of planning lack of preparedness there are going to be nuts
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  out there whether it's a cop killer like this or some idiot that walks into a
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:55.600]  theater and start shooting people some of the folks are getting the message
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:02.400]  that the best protection from crime and and other oppressive type of things that
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:08.280]  we need to be fearful about is for each individual to be prepared to protect
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.920]  themselves you can't depend on the police to protect you well Steve when
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:17.200]  you came to town a few months ago incredibly popular newscast we did one
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.520]  of the most downloaded and viewed on prison planet TV and on our YouTube
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:23.920]  channel later you just pointed out they want to make us dependent and people are
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:28.120]  finally getting 25 million on food stamps 50 million on food stamps shutting
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.920]  down the power plants raising the taxes economy imploding they want us
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:39.240]  domesticated you told the biblical story of economics and how all this works and
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.640]  people are now getting it where they're throwing the book at people that have
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.040]  lost their houses from sandy the government has finally gone over the
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.760]  edge and become a bunch of paranoid and lunatics it's not like that in every
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.880]  area of the country and Obama is now saying if Congress won't shut down all
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.000]  the power plants I'm gonna do it I'm gonna bring in a carbon tax it's openly
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.520]  testing to see if he can become a dictator I mean now is the time to get
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.920]  prepared and we're just being proven right on this the last thing they want
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:12.000]  is for us to be prepared so we better get prepared I mean it's we get made fun
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.760]  of for being prepared but look at the government they're digging in like it's
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:20.880]  the end of the world well the here's the law Alex you know it I know it and
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:26.720]  everyone out there that thinks about it has to know this the extent to which you
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:35.000]  as an individual are dependent is the extent to which you have become a victim
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:42.720]  of your own choice and given power over yourself to that on which you depend if
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:49.440]  you look in your cupboard or wherever you store your food and you don't see
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:55.680]  enough food to feed your family for six months a year however long you think
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:00.960]  it's going to take for us to recover from a total shutdown which is being
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:08.360]  threatened if you look at that you can't blame anybody but yourself if you end up
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:13.120]  like the Greeks out there having to riot to be fed if you're spending your time
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:19.640]  rioting just to get food or out there begging or standing in bread lines how
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:28.520]  effective can you be to be one of the good men who can do something if you
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.980]  exactly and the IMF World Bank 112 point plan that got leaked in 2002 that we
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:36.640]  covered in our big article yesterday how the globalists want riots and civil war
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.480]  world worldwide not just here they say we shut things down then people riot
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:45.320]  then that destroys confidence we use that to buy everything up then they
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:52.160]  riot again they want a shut down society that's what you in agenda 21 is is it's
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.240]  what we've got to buy local we've got to have gardens we've got to have sorble
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:59.000]  foods we've got to have guns we've got to have our neighbors awake we've got to
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.120]  control our counties in our cities this is the battle this is it and we need all
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.600]  the bureaucrats to realize you're on our team whether you like it or not you're
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:12.360]  not part of the New World Order you see what what has to happen is if each
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:19.040]  individual or each family decides okay I am going to take care of me there is
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:25.840]  nothing you can do to control what is said on the State of the Union address
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:33.480]  you can do nothing as individuals to go out and try and change my daddy used to
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:39.120]  say an interesting thing he says it's more difficult to change one stubborn
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:45.080]  man's mind then to change the Congress of the United States well let's take
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:52.160]  that further if our people stop being stubborn and stop choosing to be
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:56.400]  dependent and say hey feed me feed the pigs feed the pigs remember the story
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:01.840]  about the wild hogs and how you can capture them the fact is that if we
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:08.720]  stubbornly refuse to be dependent as a look at all the Hollywood movies the
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:11.800]  last 70 years making fun of the old timers that wouldn't take anything off
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.680]  anybody it what they're the people that built this country they weren't stupid
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:21.800]  they weren't backwards they weren't naive that's right and the and the fact
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:27.960]  is that if you look in your in your cupboards and you don't have food there
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.280]  and if something shuts down if these power plants go down on the grid gets
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:39.280]  messed up or whatever happens and we know that something probably will happen
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.200]  the fact that you're doing drills in every city with the police I have the
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:47.920]  articles with links to video with people holding signs up saying I need food and
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:53.000]  they're Americans I mean what are they getting ready for I don't know but I
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.240]  guess maybe we can kind of guess the fact is that Eve if each individual
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.280]  let's take a country that has everyone independent everyone can feed themselves
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:10.720]  for a year everyone has guns if they if they feel like they need them you mean
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:15.600]  the old you mean the old freer America the old freer America where every
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.560]  individual takes care of themselves it what is the opportunity what is the
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.120]  chance of anybody coming in and politically taking over unless you can
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:28.480]  get a bunch of people to vote for you to take care of them that choose to be
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.400]  dependent on you then you have total control the extent of which we're
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:37.360]  dependent is the extent to which we give power over ourselves to that on which we
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.240]  depend you see in any of these situations where we had shootings out
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:50.800]  here in Utah one of the organizations provided a free class to teachers for
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:59.800]  concealed weapon permits they had four hundred teachers come in and get their
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:05.720]  permits to carry can see these ghouls go to the schools because they know it's
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.040]  where they won't be resisted it's a gun-free zone it's a it's a free kill
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:17.560]  zone every place that that that disallows the citizens to do what
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:22.200]  Jefferson suggested that we do remember what he said the great object is that
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:29.800]  every man be armed absolutely and why is that when you have when you have the
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:35.080]  government fearing the people you have Liberty when you have the people fearing
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.920]  the government you have tyranny Jefferson also said wherever firearms
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:45.520]  are they restrain evil there you go but you see everybody you know even the
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:50.960]  conversations I watched Jay Leno a few nights ago where he had a guest on there

[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.240]  is smart for people to get storeable foods and I guess that's the final
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:34.240]  equation food is key show us water show our firearms you'll never stand in a
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:37.320]  bread line if you have your own bread but other little tidbits and points
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:43.080]  you'd like to add about what we're seeing unfold well just very very
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:50.360]  quickly yeah yeah they were they were talking about this this testimony before
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:54.040]  the Senate subcommittees and talking about how people need to protect their
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:59.760]  homes and all that the message that people are afraid to announce is the
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:05.680]  reason for the Second Amendment is not hunting not for us to protect ourselves
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:12.440]  from other Americans very simply we had come from countries as immigrants that
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:18.880]  that established this country where the government always overpowered the
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:25.120]  population with armament and they determined that for this people to stay
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:30.760]  free they had to maintain enough power in the hands of the people so that the
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:34.400]  government couldn't overpower them with armament that's why the Second Amendment
[01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:39.280]  is there nobody wants to say it they want to sugarcoat it by saying well we
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:42.200]  need this for hunting well you don't need more than five rounds for honey and
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:47.360]  why do we need these assault rifles and exactly what the founders said a
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:51.320]  tyrannical government arming to the teeth while saying turn your guns in we
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:56.280]  just want to be friends there you go enough of that we got to talk about an
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:04.040]  interesting thing the people at this point what we're trying to do Alex is
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:09.720]  tell everybody very simply like you've been telling them for years if you are
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:14.120]  not independent if you don't have your own bread you will end up standing in a
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:19.280]  bread line you do not want to be exposed to that what we're doing you announced
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:24.640]  some some contact information for us what we've done is we've put together a

[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:58.500]  five nine nine two three one your calls straight ahead but Steve what was the
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:02.080]  point about some of the new offers you've got any foods direct comm for
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:08.120]  slash Alex it's just simply the fact that the the one thing that people must
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:15.400]  realize is if each family each individual takes care of themselves then
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:21.480]  the country will take care of itself if you are independent and never have to to
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:28.380]  go and riot and go and beg and become a victim then there isn't much that you
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:32.040]  can happen and so what we've done is we've put together some packages where
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:37.980]  people get oddly enough almost as much stuff free for their for their
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:42.080]  shipments but the main thing that I got to say I don't want to make this into an
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:48.640]  infomercial Alex you know that the fact is if people if good men don't act and
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:53.240]  the way you act is you can't go out and change what's happening out there but
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:58.840]  you can control what you do the way you act has become independent so you can
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:05.200]  live to influence to help to support to work another day if we stop shopping
[02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:09.520]  with globalist if we start shopping locally if we wake people up if we get
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:13.400]  prepared that will wreck the New World Order it's that simple now tell me about
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.160]  the new Patriot pack that you've got any foods direct calm forward slash Alex
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:22.800]  well this very simply is just a wonderful piece of equipment that has
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:29.280]  the stove and everything in it and also 72 servings of food but that comes free
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:34.720]  with every $400 worth of food oddly enough if an individual orders in a one
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:40.280]  year supply of the best food on the planet they get up to 20 of these things
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:44.000]  that go along with it that they can share with their their family or they
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.760]  can use for themselves that are just great grab and go with 72 servings in it
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:53.240]  and I'm actually on the side at 76 and the free stove and some other stuff
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.960]  these are these are great boogie packs infowars.com has links over to eat foods
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:02.440]  direct calm forward slash Alex and again when you go there that's where all the
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:09.360]  specials are give them a call 800 409 5 6 3 3 800 409 5 6 3 3 we're seeing
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:13.120]  massive increases in inflation all over the world I've got a stack of that in my
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:16.000]  news today you've been predicting this for about four or five years we've seen
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.880]  food prices go up 50% on average what's happening now the only hope that people
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:28.120]  have is to do two things first of all by getting their food supply in they freeze
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:33.040]  the price at today's prices so it won't go up to the point where it will price
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.440]  them out of the market right now 20,000 families or individuals that they are
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:40.800]  dropping below the poverty level that means they don't have enough to buy
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:46.600]  their own food let alone extra the other thing is by freezing the cost and
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.520]  acquiring the food you also freeze the availability why do you think that this
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:56.760]  food is going up so much we have where the last year a seven-year famine
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:02.860]  worldwide food prices food is short we had a terrible crop this last year we're
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:06.720]  going to have another terrible one this coming year what's happening is those
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:10.040]  food prices are going to price themselves out of the market but the
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:15.980]  availability for even people that have plenty of cash set aside or gold set
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:21.080]  aside literally at some point in time out here in Utah they talk about at some
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:25.160]  point in time we won't be able to buy a loaf of bread with a bushel of gold
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:31.920]  we're getting there it just you have I hope things turn around politically and
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.480]  people can you know get Congress to try to impeach there are things we can do

[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.880]  state of the Union yet where Obama says if Congress doesn't do what I want I'll
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:31.160]  just do it with executive power on carbon taxes you name it that's all
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:36.000]  coming up there's now four clips actually different clips of official

[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:45.440]  gas and people are spinning it on CNN going they meant tear gas just like Waco
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:49.840]  right where they set the fires and said tear gas did it I mean I predicted they'd
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:54.480]  burn it down I mean just don't be so naive it's a religion of being naive I'm
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:57.680]  gonna get into that everything look now let's go through your calls quickly here
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:00.920]  I want to get to everybody at least five or six of these callers that are on

[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:13.320]  Bobby in California you won't talk about the state of the Union what you think of
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:19.960]  that Obama Obama openly oh what do you say right now you're on the air sir
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:24.160]  what's your take on that okay Obama openly announced that he bypassed
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:27.480]  Congress and signed the executive order that enforces Homeland Security's role
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:32.640]  as all-powerful king in charge of cyber security do you see that yes sir yes he
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:36.240]  said he will bypass Congress as we predicted and have a cybersecurity bill
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:42.160]  that even seen at news says his Chinese style or Russian style censorship and he
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:45.200]  won't even let Congress see the cyber order he already did that already did it
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:49.040]  warrant was wiretapping you name it and he said he'll bypass them on carbon
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:53.440]  taxes he said he'll do it everything I mean it's happening it's happening and
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:57.600]  the government is preparing for war with us they want a civil war
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:05.400]  they're crazy Obama appointed Homeland Security civil liberties division to
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:09.160]  oversee all Homeland Security to make sure they don't abuse our power well
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:12.600]  that's right to get around states rights they create a ten-member governor board
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.080]  he appoints who says it's all right to run over the states the governor's you
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:19.400]  appointed said it was okay to take over all the rural areas under the Pentagon
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:22.200]  we have a Rural Affairs Commission see we don't need the Bill of Rights
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:27.480]  Constitution or courts anymore we have these new things that linen I mean
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:33.560]  excuse me Obama has created and on the quick thing on the daughter thing I
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:36.480]  remember on the frenzy yesterday I remember thinking just like if somebody
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:38.960]  wanted to take out your whole family all they'd have to do is just make a
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:42.760]  anonymous anonymous phone call to the LAPD and say that they saw Donna go in
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:46.960]  your house and you know they didn't they come it wouldn't even be news or they
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:50.440]  could kill people blame it on you have you dead in the house burn it down two
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:54.360]  weeks later and say and again I don't think that's what happened but that's
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:58.240]  the problem with burning down houses with people is you know his charred
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:01.640]  body supposedly and they're very suspicious and oh I have two articles I
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:04.520]  haven't gotten to yet let me show these thank you for the call sir if you're a
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:08.480]  TV viewer check these out radio listeners go check them out for yourself
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:13.680]  as well Dorner manhunt ex-cop may have had help
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:19.280]  court record show LA Times and then in the article it says after authorities
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:23.240]  not servants authorities interviewed the boat captain early Thursday they found
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:28.000]  donors wallet identification cards at the San Yashiro port of entry if I'm
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.160]  saying that right near the US Mexico Ysidro the same day I guard at the point
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:37.360]  Loma Naval Base told authorities he had spotted a man matching donors
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:42.440]  description trying to sneak onto the base according to court records I mean
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:46.680]  folks you can have false alarms but I mean this is like 9-11 they found
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:50.200]  multiple passports in the rubble that day that survived it I mean it turned
[02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.880]  out it was made up and I mean this is really bizarre I don't want to say this
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.680]  wasn't staged I mean it looks like it was real because it puts egg on their
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:04.240]  face it is something they want to stage it's a PR black eye a disaster but at
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:10.320]  the same time here's the other article donors wallet found in burned-out cabin
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:17.040]  with his driver's license that's USA today this is getting so ridiculous and
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:21.760]  they didn't know if he had hostages in that house in that cabin he'd had them
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:25.720]  at the other house he'd been at earlier in the day a few miles away or was it 20
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:32.360]  miles away I mean who knows there's such lying but they say they didn't burn it
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:37.080]  down he has an accidental fire Dorner probably started at that's now on CNN as
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:42.880]  we predicted I predict if they burn down his cabin it's like predicting that
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:49.160]  grizzly bears have brown fur or the moon you know orbits the planet or the Sun
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:51.720]  comes up in the morning I mean this is not hard okay I said I'd go to your
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:55.040]  calls let's go to your calls Mike in Tennessee former military and police
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:58.640]  wants to give his take on this Mike should we just have everybody in
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:04.520]  Southern California line up and be shot that way the police are safe it looks
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:07.800]  like it's that way doesn't it yeah unfortunately I can't say that's too far
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:14.000]  from the truth is it no the behavior of these guys is actually becoming
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:21.240]  nationwide as indicated to the fellow who answered the phone I told him that I'd
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:27.840]  actually tried to work with the Miami police force shortly after actually got
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.240]  back from you know serving a little bit of time in Iraq Afghanistan and some of
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:38.800]  the other fun areas that our government likes to abuse and unfortunately Miami I
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.600]  couldn't take the behavior it was identical this famous for like shooting
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:48.080]  peaceful protesters with signs in the face with rubber bullets and then the
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:51.560]  and then the captain laughing going I love how you shot that bleeping whore in
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:57.760]  the face yeah exactly hey cops the government's gonna take everything you
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:03.000]  got to when nobody has rights it means nobody has them go ahead I'm sorry no
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.400]  that's okay and in my opinion I don't really condone the shooting of innocent
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:14.280]  people and at the same time you can almost see how Dorner would be
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:19.680]  frustrated about this behavior because still he's warped I mean you go shoot
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:24.240]  somebody's daughter because they because because it was police brutality and then
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.360]  they fired you over it because you blew the whistle I mean that's not equal
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.920]  weights and measures is my point I mean you should never go after somebody's
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:35.520]  family you should know I mean you're gonna go after somebody go after them
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:40.160]  right exactly the thing is we might be being told the wrong thing also that
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:44.000]  might be a setup to make him look bad you're right you never know that's why
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  there could be multiple ones you're right I I you know I tend to you know I
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.880]  mean he's a big Obama supporter and all this other stuff and and we've gone back
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:54.920]  and found records before this happened that he was a big Obama supporter and a
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:59.600]  gun grabber so I've done a lot of research on it I'm about 90% this is
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:04.760]  real but surely there they are trying to doll it up and do some things what kind
[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:09.120]  of stuff did you see with the Miami police force I literally saw the same
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:14.400]  thing enormous amounts of racism in fact I've lost multiple friends who joined
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:17.840]  them I don't want to say you know they didn't die or anything but I lost them
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:22.480]  to personality changes where they were for example Hispanics themselves and
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:26.240]  they start calling you know using the n-word using whatever racist slang you
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:30.920]  could you could think of towards their own self I mean you know sort of their
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:35.200]  own race towards you know black folks and it was amazing I couldn't even
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:39.160]  associate with these people and just so you know I'm actually a former Green
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.560]  Beret so this type of behavior is extremely offensive to me and there is a
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:48.880]  gangsterism if you look at gang handbooks and gang psychology police
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:52.840]  more and more are behaving like a giant street gang god bless you I appreciate
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:56.960]  your call it's just terrible ladies and gentlemen and the TV just says worship
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:01.240]  police no matter what they do that gives cover to the bad guys in the system that
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.520]  are taken over you're not helping the police putting up with bad behavior
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:08.540]  folks and we obsess on the police because as the police goes so goes the
[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:12.920]  nation okay if the police are taken over by the globalist and turned into these
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:18.080]  crazy psychos it's gonna be a civil war and I'm the biggest friend of the police
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:21.520]  ever because I don't want to see my bunch of you dead I mean if you guys are
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:26.760]  hiding out because a dorner you start the gun confiscation I mean it's I've
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:31.080]  done the math on it I know history I've studied it the cops will stand down
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.400]  what's gonna happen but if the cops tried to engage the American people
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:41.000]  every cop in America would be killed basically very quickly very quickly very
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.680]  quickly you I mean it because there's again 1% stands up of gun owners that's
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:54.920]  1.6 million combatants now you do the math being on the offense is so much
[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:59.080]  more powerful and if people go on the offense against the police they're all
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:02.800]  dead ladies and gentlemen now I don't want to go there that's why I keep

[02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:13.000]  appear to be easy targets but fake TV can fool even professional burglars into
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.040]  thinking someone is home watching television as a recent widow living
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:21.880]  alone it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:25.760]  that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:31.600]  when I'm actually away from home fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a
[02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:35.880]  light on a timer and they're so easy to use you just plug them in and they're
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:38.480]  ready to go plus they're so affordable that we have

[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.680]  yeah this is they hired Marcus wolf the former head of the Stasi died a few
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:20.800]  years ago they hired him back in 2002 to about oh five I first heard this I didn't
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:24.460]  believe it I went looked at the federal funding purchases it was like 1.1
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:27.840]  million a year to pay him the former head of the Stasi to come here and help
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:34.480]  set that up and it's an intimidation and and I've had Secret Service in FBI come
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.800]  and say what do you mean about this I mean the Texas Ranger that was here
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:40.440]  yesterday was here for 15 minutes I didn't get to talk to him as I was on
[02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:43.960]  air they just told him to go and then he wouldn't come back is all we've got what
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:47.320]  we need now he's like so what goes on around here I need to check this I only
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:51.560]  believe mainstream media so I called him up and said the government's criminal
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:55.240]  government ships in the drugs don't come around here acting like we're bad just
[02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:59.360]  because you showed up you're wearing a cowboy hat let's see you get up there
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:03.720]  and break a horse right now son I mean I'm tired of all this that I'm bad and
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.160]  government's good that's what all this is about so I've been over there the
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:11.120]  domain really nice movie theater Shane's taking his wife I've taken mine over
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.120]  there you know if we watch Dinesh D'Souza's movie I think that was the
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.080]  night he's talking about when I had a chance to meet the chef over there is
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:20.760]  that really good gourmet food at that theater North Austin I need to go back
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:25.280]  over there's not an ad for it so so starting over tell people what happened
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:29.480]  okay so you're trying to help a TSA worker who part-time is a waitress that's
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:32.840]  gonna be a pretty good gig over there the average waitress makes 19 bucks an
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:36.580]  hour but she made me even more than that so she's over there and I guess we're
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:40.960]  talking political I mean they just arrested a guy he's facing a felony for
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:44.600]  peanut butter you know I mean they're crazy they want to put us all in camps
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:48.680]  where they're slaves so tell us what happened well I really wanted to get a
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:52.000]  mind the idea of the mindset of people that actually work there and you know
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.520]  what she what she's driving for what her what her goals are but another part of
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:02.880]  the what I asked her for was any kind of documents a handbook etc that you know
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:07.480]  might give me another better idea what what goes on and I made the off comment
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:12.920]  off the cuff comment hey I'll I'll give you a reward if you bring something in
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:17.920]  that's what prompted them to come by it was the assumption that I was going to
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:22.120]  bribe or you know pay for information yeah but see I wouldn't even have talked
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:25.200]  to him because they'll spin everything against you or claim you lied about
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:28.880]  something and try to put you in jail for that you know they put Martha Stewart in
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:32.440]  jail not for insider trading but they said she lied she didn't do anything I've
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:35.680]  looked at the case meanwhile the Congress is insider trading publicly I
[02:26:35.680 --> 02:26:39.520]  mean I would just say hold on a minute I mean obviously hey I'll make you have a
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.920]  nice pizza of you you know I want to understand the handbook you know like
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:47.200]  art does the handbook say there's radiation we're trying to help them it's
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.640]  a public service I don't like that stuff's quote classified about the
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:56.120]  scanners so how did this end I'm like look I wasn't looking for classified
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:59.640]  information I was looking for open information maybe from an insider
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:03.840]  perspective and they said well you know since you weren't looking for quote
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:07.320]  unquote classified information you know we're not going to pursue this any
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:12.080]  further and you're clear but you know and then the conversation shifted to
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:15.960]  well what do you think of Alex Jones so what are your you know what how do you
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:21.440]  feel about is you know his point of view and etc oh my god very nice very nice
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:26.160]  gentleman I gotta say but you know shifting the conversation back to you
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:32.640]  asking you know what my my views were on the subject at that point I'm like look
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:38.440]  guys you know it's all great points do I agree with everything he says you know
[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:42.840]  I'm an individual I create my own decisions based on the information I get
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:47.640]  I would have said what do you think of Alex Jones I did one of the FBI agents
[02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:51.400]  that he's a listener I'm like oh that's when I had the FBI here last time they
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:57.640]  were asking what what what's that poster and I'm going it's Obama deception it's
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:01.400]  a film it's been out for lucky you know I mean it doesn't even matter I mean
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:05.840]  it's like this implication that I'm doing something wrong I mean and it's
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:11.480]  just it's just not happening I'm sorry go ahead I went on the aggressive with
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.960]  them I look I believe I'm a staunch supporter in the Second Amendment I
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:20.600]  believe in the right of the people defend themselves from tyranny now look
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:26.280]  at the both I'm like look you two will be civilians when you retire and then
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:31.200]  you will want that right and that's the only thing keeping us from becoming any
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:34.700]  other and what did they say at the end of that with the big evil chef at the
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:40.200]  movie theater they agreed with me they go oh yeah I you know we're we're
[02:28:40.200 --> 02:28:44.560]  supporters of the Second Amendment also I'm like I'm formerly the homeland

[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:09.000]  we got a conversation about that holding back the tyranny is that most people in
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:12.440]  the military and the police are still common sense and are good men and women
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:17.240]  they're trying to warp them though right now and there's a battle right now going
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:21.800]  on and look they're not gonna worry about when they get out of the of the
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:25.300]  government and are quote civilians they're gonna have to worry now this is

[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:43.320]  understand what's happening chef max so the FBI visited because you had a
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:47.400]  waitress who was also TSA and you said hey I want to find out if their manual
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:50.760]  warns you about the radiation we really need to protect you and you know people
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:56.120]  try to bring in your manual and the FBI comes to talk to you how does the story
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:35:02.520]  end well they they basically say you know hey you know don't try and bribe
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:06.480]  officials you know if you would have offered you know actually given her
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:11.440]  money that have been we would have a case for pursuing this I said I you
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:14.560]  know I totally understand you know that's not my that wasn't my goal and my
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:18.840]  intentions you know just looking for intent is key you're like hey bring me
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:22.800]  a manual they're telling you about radiation or not I'll give you a pizza
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:26.440]  basically I think that was part of the conversation also I love taking care of
[02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:31.640]  people and you know I know you've given me a free pizza you're nice everybody
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:34.880]  needs to come up there but but but still you've got the FBI and Homeland Security
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:38.640]  up there at your work you know high-class place it's it's it's all
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:43.160]  part of I mean I can't believe though did she run and then talk about this to
[02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:48.200]  them like she's secret agent it was a conversation was started at work her
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:52.040]  supervisor got involved and then before you know I mean this took six months for
[02:35:52.040 --> 02:35:55.000]  them to get to me you know it wasn't like they knocked on my door you know
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:59.560]  the day after I had the conversation but still I mean I'm I'm a little person
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:07.240]  with a view and a point of view and I still had two agents with I mean the big
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:13.000]  salaries you know well I have the Texas Ranger here because you know Rob do you
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:17.360]  broke the whole thing down for me well the security system records everything
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:20.080]  and then that entrance so I wouldn't listen to it actually listen to him
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:22.720]  must be technical I don't listen the whole thing on the time for 20-minute
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:25.760]  tape but I was in the front the end the guy seemed pretty nice but he's still
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:30.320]  like you know well I need to know who these Marines are that gave you this
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:33.600]  info because we you know you know we don't think he's crazy either and we
[02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:37.440]  want to make sure and then I call him back okay I'll talk to the Marines see
[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:40.560]  if they want to talk to you but I said do not give me a subpoena I'm gonna fight
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:44.360]  it because I go you're not gonna be able to get that with freedom of the press I
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:47.620]  know things are changing but he goes no no no I talked my supervisors you're
[02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:50.760]  right Thank You mr. Jones I said what do you mean cuz we've already got to you
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:54.160]  know you know the info you've given us from some other Marines but but your
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:57.720]  article was helpful I gotta go my supervisor says you know hang up he hung
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:01.000]  up on me won't answer the phone and I'm like I want to talk to the Texas Ranger
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  you know I wanna I want to hear what's going on I mean I want to know about I
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:13.080]  want to interrogate him in a nice way about I don't buy this story that some
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:17.760]  guy who was you know a mechanic and the Marines has PTSD and goes out and shoots
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:21.660]  Chris Kyle and then it's an open-and-shut case and the stories change
[02:37:21.660 --> 02:37:25.560]  so much good to hear from you chef max I should have clicked when I cuz I met the
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:28.880]  guy twice really nice place folks I've been in movie theaters all over the
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:32.720]  country there's swanky so I'm you know in a city or something and got an
[02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:36.060]  evening I'll say oh where's the local movie theater we can eat dinner you know
[02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:39.160]  that's kind of the the end thing the last decade or so with Alamo Drafthouse
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:42.760]  I started here in Austin but they have other ones and I'll it's one of the
[02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:47.200]  nicest or the nicest I've ever been to very very nice little plug there I get
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:53.600]  my free tickets let's go to move quick here William says he works in
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:58.000]  intelligence in Virginia William what's your take on the Dorner case is that
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.600]  what you called in about multiple things sir I just I just want to take a second
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:06.120]  to kind of explain because I listen to what you're saying you're absolutely
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:09.640]  correct but it's almost like your viewers don't understand what's going
[02:38:09.640 --> 02:38:13.680]  on and when you say it's an in for you're absolutely right but it's
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:19.960]  multifaceted in the army we call this a basic flanking maneuver so the
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:25.320]  distraction is the main attack right in your face the flanking maneuver to the
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:29.880]  left or right what they're going behind the scenes so as the administration
[02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:35.320]  text-to-text-to-text with executive orders or proposed legislation around to
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:41.680]  the right side DHS is preparing for military action and it's very very
[02:38:41.680 --> 02:38:44.880]  obvious but if people don't understand what they're seeing they won't understand it
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:49.240]  yeah there's a giant arms buildup and now open admission they're preparing for
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:54.600]  giant war in all 50 states with the people I mean this is so depressing so
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.960]  horrible it means they're gonna totally collapse things and I want to stop it
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:07.320]  man I live here I mean this is crazy this is crazy we've got the FBI visiting
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:11.000]  chefs because they want to learn about the radiation manuals that if they're
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:14.920]  admitting they're dangerous trying to help people federal employees meanwhile
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:21.600]  the globalist are gutting the country I'm sorry go ahead make a point so the
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:25.640]  second thing I wanted to get to was in the army we have a saying about the
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:32.000]  planning for operations and it is no plan survives first contact so what you
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.400]  have to understand is these guys are planning for two outcomes they can
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:42.520]  slowly pick peccados until we just forfeit all right or they can push those
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.920]  until we fire and that's what DHS is there for that's right people people
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:51.200]  always say to me well which is it where's the martial law they're trying to
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:55.440]  ease us into it but if it causes too much resistance they may go all the way
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.200]  so you're right they've probably got five different plans running
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:03.920]  simultaneously that run from soft takeover to hard takeover and that means
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:09.080]  detonating nukes and saying the Patriots did it they've got five major plans for
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.120]  my study and watching their pre programming see the programming tells
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:15.280]  you where they're going with the public that's targeted towards unconscious
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:19.200]  people you're conscious you see it that gives you information awareness of what
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:23.400]  the battle plan is by the technotronic programming that's going on but I'm
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:27.240]  sorry you've got the floor go ahead and make your points oh yes sir you're
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:30.760]  absolutely right so it's just people need to understand that this is
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:34.200]  absolutely real and just because you don't feed in your particular
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:38.400]  neighborhood or area it doesn't mean it's not going on pay attention to the
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:45.320]  news and always remember always remember everyone is more radical the legislation
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:49.600]  and ideas come from the White House the distraction will become that much more
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:55.760]  ridiculous think about it all these things going on Hollywood stars and the
[02:40:55.760 --> 02:41:01.040]  shooter out in in California all these things to keep your attention on those
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:04.920]  things that are not necessarily that important so that the plan can be pushed
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:10.160]  forward you're saying Dornan may actually be staged no no sir I'm not
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:14.840]  saying that he's what I'm saying is if you notice there was national attention
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.640]  they decide to get attention that becomes the diversion yeah absolutely
[02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:23.120]  absolutely let me ask you this because it's now in the army time stars and
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:27.040]  stripes urban warfare drills I mean it's admitted they're preparing for total
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:31.560]  civil unrest takeover of the states that's all actually on the books public
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:34.800]  it's just the general public doesn't look it up so it becomes a rumor you
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:38.680]  know it's kind of like I hear there's a place called the South Pole called the
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:44.040]  Antarctic but I never saw it so it's a rumor no no it's down there okay and so
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:47.440]  it's the same thing like I heard there's a Niagara Falls but I ain't never saw it
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:50.360]  you know before there was television and stuff people had to go off what they
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:55.840]  were told or so it's the same thing but for people in quote intelligence I'd
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:58.040]  guess if you're in Virginia it's probably military something but I don't
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:02.640]  know I mean are they freaking out over the fact that it's now always been
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:05.920]  hidden they're preparing for domestic war for about 20 years now they're
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:09.320]  uncloaking and accelerating the programming which means they're getting
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:13.620]  ready to go hot or at least looking at going hot I mean are people realizing
[02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:19.480]  what this means some of them are sir but you also have to remember the beltway
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:23.560]  it's kind of immune to everything else going outside of that area it's in a
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:27.960]  bubble like Hitler's bunker absolutely so people here aren't really filling the
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:31.760]  financial crunch to everyone everywhere else's some people are living in a dream
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:35.580]  I work with some people who are completely aware what's going on but at
[02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:39.400]  the same time they say I have to make a paycheck a pool my table I gotta pay my
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:43.880]  house mortgage and I keep telling them well if you don't speak out against this
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:47.920]  you may not have a house to pay for you know you may not have a table to put
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:52.280]  food on see that's what scary is is is that the programs work from
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:56.760]  deindustrialization hardcore depression reorganization breaking of the American
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.560]  people on the on the light end to absolute Mao Zedong kill half America
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:06.320]  level crap and I've studied history so much folks I'm not saying that to scare
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:11.520]  you they're leaning towards Mao Zedong level stuff so once the gloves come off
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:15.920]  folks it's just gonna be hell on earth and I hope everybody understands they
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:21.880]  were warned go ahead yes sir and from my military experience I was in solution I
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:26.880]  was there and I saw that you know we were almost no holds bar there and I'm
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:30.420]  telling people you they need to listen and from my personal experience my
[02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:36.900]  personal opinion I believe that the main plan is to prepare for a military
[02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:41.520]  conflict within the United States of America DHS is openly ordering all these
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:47.280]  things you would need for an open conflict and people I'm telling a long
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:51.280]  war a long war where they're gonna be forced into certain regions I mean they
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:58.360]  plan a full-out long war and mr. Jones the only issue I've ever had for you had
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:02.560]  to have against you and this is the I've been looking for a long time is that you
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:06.720]  hesitate to tell people how bad things will get and it's because you don't want
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:10.360]  to scare people understand that but people need to hear it people understand
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:16.720]  how quickly you know their area can be cordoned off and forces can come in and
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:20.880]  blow through houses so fast they don't know what hit them they don't understand
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:25.360]  it you know their water and power can be shut off to a specific area and though
[02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:30.160]  you can be wait it out and the issue is at first they're gonna wipe people out
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:33.980]  put out PR on them to demonize them but then I know what's gonna happen the
[02:44:33.980 --> 02:44:38.040]  veterans and people are not that they're scared they're just been waiting they're
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:42.040]  gonna go completely ape against anybody in the government I mean from your
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:44.080]  research what do you think's gonna happen to people in the military and
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.700]  police once the Civil War kicks off I think a lot of you growing people will
[02:44:48.700 --> 02:44:53.380]  pick a side which also have to understand that as many arms as we may
[02:44:53.380 --> 02:44:57.440]  have on the civilian side and I own weapons on support of the Second
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:02.020]  Amendment you also have to remember during the invasion of Iraq you had
[02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:06.160]  Iraqis who believed because they were told by Saddam Hussein that if they put
[02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:10.040]  plastic wrap over RPGs they could destroy the Abrams invisible force field
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:15.100]  okay not that Americans believe things like that but if you think about what we
[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:20.000]  will go up against okay all the donor gun owners there are in America we don't
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:25.360]  make a difference against an Abrams or Bradley's or strikers or UAVs with
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:28.760]  health fire well what's gonna happen is but I mean but still they couldn't hold
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:33.040]  all of Baghdad what you're saying is true but it's the issue is it's gonna be
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:37.840]  like donors it's going to be people where they go out get one person and
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:41.800]  then never do anything again I mean it's it's it's I've studied the history of
[02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:45.160]  total resistance it's just gonna be horrible I just want to not have this
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:49.280]  happen I just want to have America wake up the problem is is that it looks like
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:54.840]  the system is just hammer down and if if libertarians and constitutionalists and
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:46:00.800]  conservatives and liberals don't wake up and say no to this tyranny it's over god
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:03.200]  bless you I appreciate your call anything else you want to add William
[02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:07.960]  yeah just real quick the whole donor thing people don't need to understand
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:13.240]  that that episode revealed the weakness and the lie behind terrorism in the
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.320]  United States of America one guy a reservist in the Navy he doesn't get
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:21.160]  specialized training like the Army or the Marine Corps he took very basic CI
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:27.400]  training and he almost defeated the LAPD the FBI the marshals and they had
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:31.680]  reapers or drones out there looking for him this will tell you if they were ever
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:36.800]  real terrorists in America we could not stop them we had all the assets we could
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:40.720]  have but that's what I'm saying if it goes to civil war the veterans are gonna
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:44.240]  go asymmetrical and there's gonna be no way to stop them because they're not
[02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:48.080]  gonna be popping up for the predator to get them it's gonna be a bunch of
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:52.200]  off-duty cops are at a bar and you know what happens I mean it's just and then
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:54.920]  that's what they're preparing for they're training police for five years
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:59.480]  you will face veterans with IEDs well you're going to kill veterans families
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:02.640]  before they come after you and they are they're planning to try to come arrest
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:07.240]  everybody I mean they're gonna force us into a civil war to wipe us all out
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:11.840]  that's the goal we've got to get that word out and stop it god bless you I
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:14.480]  appreciate the call but I just can't believe we're talking like this on air
[02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:19.320]  and the thing is I know I'm right I know that's where it's going and now it's all
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:25.760]  materializing but let me tell you why they could win they'll nuke a city or
[02:47:25.760 --> 02:47:30.320]  something they'll go that bad or say Patriots released a bio weapon and have
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.600]  the guy captured and have him confess to it and they'll use you know 20 million
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:39.520]  dead from some horrible mousepox as the thing of it was the gun owners that did
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:43.240]  it I mean folks you gotta understand they're confident for a reason they got
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:47.960]  nasty stuff up their sleeve and it's not our military it's a foreign global
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:53.160]  technocracy that's what they call it themselves a technotronic technocracy of
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:59.200]  scientific masterminds programming the US military and government programming
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:02.920]  us for self-destruction shutting everything down dumbing down the family
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:08.000]  injecting our troops with cancer virus shots I mean it's just it's total war
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:13.520]  the US is under attack this is a foreign New World Order takeover what you're
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:17.880]  saying people say well why are you still alive because they don't want to kill me
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:21.360]  because then that would add credibility to what I've done they don't want to
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:25.400]  martyr me yet okay and I'm not looking to die I don't want to die but I mean
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:28.960]  you know what I'm not worried about it folks because I know how real this is I
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:33.520]  want to beat these people man I want the good guys to win I don't I've studied
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:40.720]  this so I know how they work so we can beat them and you know I've talked to
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:46.080]  generals and people retired generals famous ones current people and you talk
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:48.840]  to them and they go wow how do you know this I never thought of that they're not
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:52.880]  even that something they're not smart they've never been uncompartmentalized
[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:57.720]  and I don't know I can't believe I know more than most people I just even in the
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:02.480]  government I'm not that special folks it's not a good feeling to know more
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:07.000]  than almost anybody else I mean I know what the globalists at the
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.360]  top know but I'm not with them I've reverse engineered their whole program
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:14.060]  and I've confirmed my analysis through their actions and I'm just like oh my

[02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:49.840]  way it's gonna be nice and I'm saying no it's not that last fella I was gonna
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:53.840]  talk to hung up but let's go to callers quickly Carl and Oregon you're on the
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:58.840]  air thanks for holding you're a trooper hello Alex good to talk to you again I
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:02.440]  have a friend in the fire department who works closely with the San Bernardino
[02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:07.840]  County Sheriff and this is called operation torque bad guy that's what
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:11.920]  this whole operation is about well I mean we got like four different tapes of
[02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:14.720]  them saying we're gonna burn him down and kill him we're gonna kill we're
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:18.000]  gonna burn down the house people like they don't mean burn down the house
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:23.760]  CNN's like burn down the house is code for ice cream cones so what did your
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:28.040]  source tell you they don't want this individual to be able to get his story
[02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:33.160]  out don't want them to be some type of a folk hero be able to write a book and be
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:36.120]  able to expose anything that could perhaps bring down their credibility
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:42.100]  well of course so they burned him up exactly yeah my friends work with them
[02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:45.080]  for years and that that's that's just normal protocol when you have a
[02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:47.760]  situation like that but a cop killer that's out there taking out one of
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:52.560]  their own you know all you know all bets off you know I wish the police would act
[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:58.240]  like this when citizens got killed oh yes yes but there's you know it's a
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:02.000]  brotherhood got understanding mentality it's a brotherhood among among each
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.880]  other there's a camaraderie that they you know if somebody that goes rogue in
[02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:08.640]  their system they're gonna have to cover this up immediately so that way nothing
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:11.880]  can go sideways on them no but they're so arrogant now with the cover-ups that
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:14.760]  they're all on the radio saying we're gonna burn it up and kill him and now
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:18.400]  they're going Oh burn down the house is code for something else they're actually
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:25.520]  saying that it's called it you know it's called wearing the house and then they
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:30.240]  cordoned him up and then they took him out he shot himself I don't know yeah
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:32.880]  they told the news cut the feed and I said oh looks like they're gonna burn
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:36.400]  him up and they burn him up be like well you've got four tapes of them saying
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:39.400]  they were gonna burn him up and burn down the house but that means something
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:42.720]  different conspiracy theorist you know it's like if you saw an elephant you're
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:45.240]  living and that's not an elephant that's a gray mouse you're like well it's
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:50.440]  gigantic you're not a crazy person are you good to hear from you Carl Chris in
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:55.440]  Missouri you're on the air go ahead military your take on this my take on
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:57:02.040]  this is actually pretty simple I served overseas and in both theaters and I've
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:06.360]  thrown flashbangs and all types of shit in all types of rooms and I'm an
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:09.440]  active-duty armed service member and I'm actually in a combat MOS which means I
[02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:14.320]  don't clean laundry or or work in a supply room or anything like that I go
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:18.400]  outside the wire and I actively look for roadside boxes what we do and in doing
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:22.200]  this a lot of times we actually raid homes and we'll throw flashbangs in I've
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:26.480]  done flashbangs in rooms full of HME homemade explosives and nothing's
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:30.560]  happened people hit the deck they drop they cover their heads that's that's
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:33.960]  pretty unstable so I don't see how you can throw a flashbang in a room and
[02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:38.240]  cause rounds to cook off and it's actually obviously they're like oh the
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:43.440]  flashbang has the rounds cooking off well okay it's on tape we said burn the
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:47.280]  mother effer down but that doesn't mean burn the burn the mother effing house
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:52.440]  down doesn't mean burn the house down now yeah I understand completely and and
[02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:56.240]  I want to touch on something else to you was talking about a lot of the urban
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:59.800]  warfare that's going on or the training that goes on at the mouth training which
[02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:03.400]  is really a big part of what we do combat an urban terrain oh yes are you
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:07.960]  trying to fight the American people I'm not gonna say that but what I will say
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:11.120]  is in the beginning when I joined in 2005 when we went to our mouth sites
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:15.240]  that's our training sites they were mock mock parts of the city like mock parts
[02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:18.900]  of the crit or Baghdad or Kirkuk and that was in the beginning and when you
[02:58:18.900 --> 02:58:21.620]  raided a building you walked into a building that pretty much looked like a
[02:58:21.620 --> 02:58:24.640]  mud hut but great because those cinder blocks because they want to be
[02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:29.280]  cost-efficient well now a lot of our training areas you go to it looks like
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:34.600]  downtown USA yeah I know I mean you're just now you're compartmentalized at the
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:37.160]  higher levels is declassified it's for the American people it's public
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:42.600]  incredible info wars calm the latest news folks will cover more tomorrow
