[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Mr. Jones, this is George Bush, the President of the United States.
[00:06.000 --> 00:16.000]  And I've heard many things that you have been saying on the Internet and other various
[00:16.000 --> 00:19.000]  mediums that are out there.
[00:19.000 --> 00:27.000]  I understand you have problems with the government and you believe in that.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  Many conspiracies.
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  But I believe that we can work this out.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  If you will take my phone call, we can speak about this stuff.
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  We will work this out.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  It's diplomacy.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  Diplomatic diplomacy is the way to go.
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.000]  And if the two of us can work this out, and I think we can,
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.000]  we will definitely have it worked out there.
[00:59.000 --> 01:03.000]  All right, well, we will try it back.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  You know, if you need to keep doing what you're doing, do it.
[01:06.000 --> 01:30.000]  But, uh, okay.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  That was Frank Hulliendo about a year and a half ago on the mancast show,
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  calling into my home answering machine.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  He's scheduled to join us coming up in Tex Marz and Studio.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  And Webster Tarpley in the last hour today.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  So that is the broadcast we have lined up for you.
[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000]  A lot of key financial news, geopolitical news happening around the world as well.
[02:01.000 --> 02:10.000]  But, uh, back when I got that call from Frank Hulliendo playing the part of George Bush,
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  I actually got another one later, but we never even put it on the air.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  I told people I thought it was Frank Hulliendo, and a few weeks later,
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  when I was back on the mancast show, both of them called me and I was on air with them.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  And they said, yeah, your, your, uh, guesstimation was correct.
[02:25.000 --> 02:27.000]  It was Frank Hulliendo.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  And so a lot of people still think on the internet that that's really George Bush.
[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  There's hundreds of thousands of views, uh, several videos.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  One of them's got about 250,000.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  Another one has about 100,000 views just on YouTube alone,
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  with these huge debates raging and people thinking that George Bush really called me
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  and that I'm somehow in league with George Bush.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's Frank Hulliendo who hosts multiple TV shows,
[02:52.000 --> 03:03.000]  currently has one on CBS and TBS, and, um, be on the show coming up here in just a little while.
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  We'll also have open phones today on any issue that you would like to discuss.
[03:10.000 --> 03:11.000]  I'll open the phones up a little bit later.
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  We're going to be taking calls right now.
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  On a more serious note, nuclear incident would make 9-11 insignificant,
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  nuclear commission says, John, did you just say something to me?
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  Oh, okay, good.
[03:29.000 --> 03:30.000]  I didn't hear you there.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  So we'll be covering that nuclear incident would make 9-11 insignificant.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  That's what a global commission on nukes is saying.
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  But right now let's go ahead and go to the guy who is, uh,
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.000]  well, pretty much the hottest comedian in the United States right now,
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  Frank Hulliendo, starting another TV show tonight.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  Frank, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  Hey, glad to talk to you.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  You bet.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  You know, a lot of people still think that George Bush really called me.
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  Hey, Alex, what's going on, man?
[03:56.000 --> 03:57.000]  Nothing much.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  Are you going to miss, uh, Bush leaving office?
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  Uh, yeah, I think in some ways, uh, you know, but I mean,
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  I don't think people are going to forget him.
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  So I think that there's definitely, uh, a legacy in many ways.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  I mean, it's interesting.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  Some people love the president.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  There's a lot of people that don't, uh, and he's a two-term president.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  So I think the one-term president gets forgotten pretty quickly.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  Two-term presidents usually have a scandal or two.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  So, uh, and people, uh, you know, people tend to blame a president,
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  even though there's things that are outside of that president's realm of blame sometimes.
[04:33.000 --> 04:38.000]  But, um, I think that, uh, you know, I think people will definitely know.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  I am working on the, you know, the McCain and Obama,
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  and more recently I've started working on Obama pretty hard.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Yeah.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.000]  You're one of the most prolific, I'm not the most prolific, uh,
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  imitators or somebody you can, uh, you know, basically copy to a T.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  What's your favorite impersonation right now?
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  Uh, Charles Barkley, because I can call somebody a knucklehead
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  and they don't complain about it.
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  Give us a Charles Barkley.
[05:03.000 --> 05:04.000]  Look at that guy with the knucklehead.
[05:04.000 --> 05:05.000]  I want to talk about it.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  It's a terrible, terrible, really bad knucklehead.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  And it's, he, uh, you know, he kind of speaks the truth in the real Charles Barkley.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  So what I do is I make him a little bit crazy and talk from that perspective.
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  You know, I got followed in by a couple of leprechauns,
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  and let me tell you something.
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  If you're at the end of the rainbow, run with that pot of gold,
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  because those leprechauns will not get rid of you.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  It's terrible.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  Have you ever seen that TV newscast where the people really think there's a leprechaun?
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  No.
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  Yeah.
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  Just Google, uh, leprechaun on the news and there's people going,
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  I think there's a leprechaun.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  There he is in the tree.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  Uh, what about a George Bush imitation?
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  He's leaving office here.
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  Can you tell us how George Bush is feeling about the economy
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  and the whole police state he's set up?
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  Well, I think it's, uh, I think it's, uh, it's, uh, difficult.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  I mean, we, uh, I think you're talking about the, uh,
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  like the, uh, the Patriot Act and whatnot that we're talking about there.
[05:58.000 --> 06:00.000]  We need to know what's going on.
[06:00.000 --> 06:03.000]  We need to, uh, we need to understand what, uh,
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  what's happening in this world and, uh,
[06:05.000 --> 06:09.000]  we need to know what's going on behind closed walls or doors or whatever.
[06:09.000 --> 06:10.000]  They're closed.
[06:10.000 --> 06:13.000]  So, uh, the next thing is, uh, this bailout.
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.000]  I think, uh, I think we have to do it.
[06:15.000 --> 06:19.000]  I think we have to, uh, we have to understand that something that's, uh,
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  a necessary necessity of necessity.
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  Yes.
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.000]  Well, you're the decider.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  Have you heard that some people think 9-11's an inside job that you did it, Mr. President?
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  Well, I've heard that.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  I think that's, uh, Charles, what do you think that is?
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  I think that's a bunch of knuckleheads.
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  Even Charles Barkley thinks that's crazy.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  But, uh, you know, if people can think what they want, think.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  I'm willing to, uh, I'm willing to be hated to protect this country.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  Where were the WMDs, Mr. President?
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  Well, they're invisible.
[06:51.000 --> 06:53.000]  That's what we found out.
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.000]  They're invisible. They're under a, uh, a scary thing called the cloak of invisibility.
[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  They're there. You just can't see them.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  That could be a new episode.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  Mr. President, this is Frank Colliendo.
[07:06.000 --> 07:12.000]  He's able to really, uh, mimic your mannerisms in your speech patterns and, and, and your tone.
[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  He's, he's starting another big TV show tonight.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  Uh, are you going to be tuning into that?
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.000]  Can you tell us what time it's on?
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  Uh, I believe it's 11 o'clock Eastern, 10 o'clock Central, uh, Frank TV on TBS.
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  Of course, I've got some bad mists, mists disinformation.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  That's happened before, but, uh, I think it's going to be pretty good.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  Uh, there's Katia Dondo-Fellick and, uh, Joe Capacate. What's the best of them?
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  Got two new guys.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  A guy who's actually from Austin, Texas.
[07:35.000 --> 07:38.000]  Uh, uh, we've been, we've been in Houston for a while.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  Uh, Mike, Mike McRae.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  And then there's Freddie Lockhart.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  Uh, there's a great job from, uh, Phoenix, Arizona.
[07:46.000 --> 07:53.000]  And these guys, uh, they're like a, uh, a troop of, uh, troopers.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  They're troop of troopers.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  Not like troop of troopers, which are from Super Mario Brothers.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  Hold on just a second, Mr. President.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  We've only got a few minutes left with you, and we're coming back to a couple of stations. Here we go.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've only got him for a few minutes. President George W. Bush is here.
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  He's very upset about Frank TV and Frank Colliendo imitating him.
[08:21.000 --> 08:28.000]  Mr. President should, I mean, is this identity theft to have Frank Colliendo being able to impersonate you to a T-shirt?
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  Well, I hadn't thought of it that way, but I'm glad you brought it up.
[08:33.000 --> 08:39.000]  I think he's okay. I think he's alright. He, uh, he says silly things, and I don't really say silly things.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  So I think people will know what the difference is.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  But you're the decider. Should he be allowed to imitate you?
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  I'm the decider, and these are the deciderhouse rules.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  That's what this is about, Alex. A.J., if you will.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  Uh, you know, I think everything's gonna be fine. I think I'll leave a little on this one and write it out.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  I'm getting pretty tired of just, uh, running the Earth stuff.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  Do you think you're gonna go down in history as the greatest president ever?
[09:05.000 --> 09:10.000]  Because you said in a press conference that in history we'll all be dead, or are you just not worried about it?
[09:10.000 --> 09:17.000]  Well, I think we're, uh, I think we're, uh, I think I've done a good job. I think I tried my best.
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  I think there's a lot of evil doers out there trying to get us, and I think we stopped them.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  Well, in closing, Mr. President, can you put Frank Calliando back on the line?
[09:25.000 --> 09:32.000]  Because I heard he was at the White House with you today, uh, you know, trying to learn how to be a great leader.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  Yeah, I would put him on. He took a nap here. Hey, how are you?
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  Hey, Frank, why are you hanging around with President Bush?
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  I just thought it would be cool. I mean, I met Carl Roeb a couple weeks ago. He introduced me to him. It was great.
[09:44.000 --> 09:53.000]  I mean, is it true that you've been, um, basically been hired on the side to do, uh, basically fake phone calls to foreign leaders
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  when President Bush is taking his three-hour naps?
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  No, that's not true, but I thank you for starting the rumor.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  Hey, to be serious, you know, people on the Internet just from those calls you made to my answering machine with, uh, ManCal,
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  they really think George Bush called me, and now they think I'm in league with him.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  That's your audience.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  No, that's my audience, though. It's Frank Gallendo. It's people on YouTube.
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  You gotta be careful of being too truthful to your own audience, Alex.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  Alright, Frank Gallendo again. Tell us about the new TV show tonight.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  Uh, Frank TV on at 11 o'clock Eastern, 10 o'clock Central, uh, you know, we start out with, uh, we start out,
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  I think, you know, W came out this weekend. By the way, on my website, if you want to take a look, there's FrankGallendo.com,
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  Josh Brolin and Oliver Stone talking about watching me to learn how to do the W for the W movie.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  You know, I saw that film. Brolin does an uncanny, George Bush.
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  Yeah, and, well, and apparently you watched me for some of it to learn how to do it, so, uh, that's it.
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  It's great to, you know, these guys know who I am. I thought that was pretty cool.
[10:56.000 --> 11:02.000]  FrankGallendo.com, uh, TBS nationwide tonight, uh, but showing different time zones.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  Uh, the final question here is what is your, we're saying your favorite one is, is, is Charles Barkley.
[11:09.000 --> 11:13.000]  Uh, how did you get into, uh, imitating people?
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  I just always had a little bit of a knack for it as a kid growing up my entire life.
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  I do impressions of friends and stuff, watching Living Color Center alive and do those impressions.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  And I figured out, you know, I went to school for broadcast journals and thought, hey, why not take a chance at this?
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  I didn't really like, uh, interviewing people, so I didn't want to be a newscaster or anything like that.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  That's what I think. Try this and it worked out.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  Did you know who I was whenever ManCal got you to call my home answering machine?
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  Uh, no, I did not at the time.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  Okay, oh, and you probably still don't do it.
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.000]  I'm still learning.
[11:41.000 --> 11:48.000]  Okay, well, uh, I, I'm actually, uh, the, the, uh, real George Bush and that's just a clone they have up there in Washington.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  Hey, FrankGallendo, thanks for the time. I hope to get you back up on the show.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Hey, appreciate it. Thanks very much.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  Take care. There he goes, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, that's what I figured.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  ManCal just told him to call him and say, hey, Mr. Jones and that's, uh, that was amazing.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  And then he called in a second time. I should have saved that and put that on the air as well.
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.000]  You know, we put it on air. We told people that it was, uh, obviously somebody, Frank calling me and I predicted it was Frank calling Endo.
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  I've only seen him a few times on TV due to the imitation, but it, it sounded like Frank calling Endo doing George Bush and it turned out I was correct.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, mystery completely solved.
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.000]  It was Frank, Collie Endo and ManCal that were doing that.
[12:30.000 --> 12:37.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have now, um, spent about 12 minutes screwing around here on the show today.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  If people just tuned in or wondering what I'm talking about, about the George Bush calls Alex Jones clip.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  That's what it's called on the web. I will play that for you one more time and get into all the serious news. Here it is.
[12:47.000 --> 13:07.000]  Mr. Jones, this is George Bush, the president of the United States, and I've heard many things that you have, you know, been saying on the internet and other various, you know, mediums that are out there.
[13:07.000 --> 13:18.000]  I understand you have problems with, you know, the government and you believe in many conspiracies.
[13:18.000 --> 13:27.000]  But I believe that we can work this out. If you will, if you will take my phone call, we can speak about this stuff.
[13:27.000 --> 13:46.000]  We will work this out, you know. It's diplomacy, you know. Diplomatic diplomacy is the way to go. And if the two of us can work this out, I mean, and I think we can, we will definitely have it worked out there.
[13:46.000 --> 13:58.000]  All right, well, we will try it back. You know, if you need to keep doing what you're doing, do it. But okay.
[13:58.000 --> 14:07.000]  You know, I said yesterday at the start of the show I was going to do a review of W. And since Frank Collindo brought up the new Oliver Stone film,
[14:07.000 --> 14:18.000]  I'm going to go ahead and spin the rest of this segment critiquing W. And then I hope that one of my writers will take the points I'm making, put a little blurb up on the site with my review of it.
[14:18.000 --> 14:28.000]  I think it's a horrible whitewash and a rehabilitation of George W. Bush and his father, George Herbert Walker Bush.
[14:28.000 --> 14:40.000]  It makes George Herbert Walker Bush look like some type of humanitarian angel who was a great intellectual and did a great job in the first Gulf War and a wonderful humanitarian.
[14:40.000 --> 15:01.000]  It frames George W. Bush as a moron hillbilly Texan at the front, but who was lovable, kind of an idiot, savant genius with campaigns, the real genius with Carl Rove teaching him more than Rove taught him, teaching his father when he ran an 88 how to win.
[15:01.000 --> 15:16.000]  Just absolutely disgusting on that front. The W.M.D.s in Iraq, it was all a mistake. They really believed that the W.M.D.s were there.
[15:16.000 --> 15:26.000]  They're all very upset and depressed that they were wrong when it's come out that they premeditatedly said fix the intelligence lie about it in the White House memo on the Downing Street memo.
[15:26.000 --> 15:44.000]  George Bush thought they were there. He is a holy rolling Christian energized by a TV preacher in Texas, a backwoodsy type. He has a born again conversion, which has been closely looked at and is not true.
[15:44.000 --> 15:58.000]  George Bush, of course, is a member of Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, constantly partying, stumbling, drunk off Air Force One, helicopter, Marine One, and Air Force One, the jet, routinely.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  I mean, really, all blame is heaped on Texans and all blame is heaped on Christians.
[16:03.000 --> 16:19.000]  And I'm not even here as a Christian defending Christians. I mean, if I was an atheist, knowing who George Bush is, knowing the military industrial complex and big banks and Carlisle Group, the controlling, I would come on here and say, well, as an atheist, if I wasn't even an atheist, I would say,
[16:19.000 --> 16:34.000]  you know, this is all blamed on Christians and he's a backwoodsy, folksy guy that worked in the oil fields and thought he was doing the Lord's work and that he prayed before each and every decision he made, just totally made up from what we know.
[16:34.000 --> 16:47.000]  He's also a real nice guy in the White House, not the vicious mean person that it's been confirmed that he is. It also puts forth a lie that Bush actually ran things and that was even above Cheney.
[16:47.000 --> 16:57.000]  And so it's all to be blamed on him. The whole Neural Order agenda, the loss of liberties, the freedoms, the torture. It makes the torture cute and funny and ripping fingernails out.
[16:57.000 --> 17:06.000]  Lovable. And, you know, he's just a funny guy who meant well and is a sports fan and he made all the decisions so now we can forget what government's done the last eight years.
[17:06.000 --> 17:15.000]  There's no global elite. There's no technocracy that used him as a front. You know, now that's a chapter that's closed and he's just a cute, funny dog-like person.
[17:15.000 --> 17:22.000]  I left the movie and I asked my wife, I said, what image of him did you get? She said an idiot savant who's like a lovable little dog.
[17:22.000 --> 17:33.000]  I was thinking the exact same words. I was thinking, idiot savant, lovable little dog. He's a dog-like mannerisms, you know, and the poster they use with him with his face down, you know, his chin down on the desk.
[17:33.000 --> 17:54.000]  She said exactly what I was thinking. So, I mean, it was just overwhelming. I went to see that Sunday night. He's all American. He's handsome. He's misunderstood.
[17:54.000 --> 18:03.000]  There's also this sick scene where they kind of sell the American people on, well, they're terrorists. They have WNDs and we need the oil and don't we need the oil? Don't we want the money as Americans?
[18:03.000 --> 18:10.000]  It's kind of like a sick inside deal with the American people, kind of like in on it. Don't you want the oil? And I was looking at people's faces in the theater.
[18:10.000 --> 18:18.000]  They were like smacking their lips and feeling powerful through it like they were in on the decision-making process in their delusional world.
[18:18.000 --> 18:26.000]  So, no discussion of skull and bones, although it shows fraternity life. No discussion of Bohemian Grove.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  The fable that, again, he was the leader and meant well and actually ran things.
[18:32.000 --> 18:49.000]  Just over and over again and there's a scene with the guy playing Colin Powell where they who they make like God in the film where he says, I'm paraphrasing as I wasn't writing notes in the theater, I should have.
[18:49.000 --> 18:56.000]  I just didn't think about doing it. It's advertised as something, you know, kind of discrediting Bush and it doesn't. It's totally opposite.
[18:56.000 --> 19:02.000]  Very sneaky. They couldn't have just come in with a ham-fisted propaganda pro-New World Order pro-Bush.
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  But by doing this, it's a beautiful propaganda.
[19:06.000 --> 19:12.000]  There's a scene where Colin Powell says, well, we can have a New World Order or we can have global chaos.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  No, New World Order is one thing. What George Bush Sr. was setting up, he says, but this is global chaos.
[19:17.000 --> 19:24.000]  So, see, we need a New World Order, but George Bush has been going against that when he's actually been for it.
[19:24.000 --> 19:33.000]  So the New World Order is a good thing. They do mention Bush with Blair going, you know, we could fly a plane over and try to get Saddam to shoot it down.
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  That's the one thing that's accurate. And then when we get back, I'll tell you from some Hollywood insiders.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  I've been told by two separate Hollywood insiders separately.
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  One who knows Oliver Stone, one that knows him well.
[19:49.000 --> 19:56.000]  And I'll tell you what separately. I was told two years ago about Flight 93 and why he was doing that.
[19:56.000 --> 19:59.000]  And then a few months ago, I was told about this dubbing move.
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  We'll give you the inside scoop when we get back.
[20:01.000 --> 20:05.000]  Attention, this is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[20:05.000 --> 20:12.000]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[20:12.000 --> 20:24.000]  Here is why. This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secret of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.

[20:59.000 --> 21:06.000]  That's now.
[21:29.000 --> 21:39.000]  The U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce. However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[22:16.000 --> 22:23.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[22:23.000 --> 22:30.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:34.000 --> 22:44.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[24:20.000 --> 24:25.000]  Radio review of W with Josh Brolin.
[24:25.000 --> 24:40.000]  Look, I have no desire to bash Josh Brolin. His dad is a 9-11 Truth or James Brolin, famous actor, award-winning actor of movies and TV in his own right, and stage.
[24:40.000 --> 24:48.000]  I had a chance to meet Josh Brolin at the DNC at a Ralph Nader event. He was with Sean Penn.
[24:48.000 --> 24:57.000]  He's very talented and did a great job. I would say that he does the best job and after that the lady that plays, the kind of Lisa Rice, it's just unbelievably spot on.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  Unbelievable character acting.
[25:01.000 --> 25:11.000]  And I want to like Oliver Stone. I mean his JFK is definitive. It's accurate. It's just a wonderful film.
[25:11.000 --> 25:22.000]  But I remember about two years ago being out in Los Angeles with a couple of big directors and there were several well-known movie stars there.
[25:22.000 --> 25:36.000]  And we're having a big discussion around dinner about why is he making this Flight 93 movie because the reviews were coming out that it was a pro-official story.
[25:36.000 --> 25:44.000]  When it's well-known that Oliver Stone knows what the government's up to, I mean he made JFK.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  And it was basically, well, he had that a hit in a while and he's afraid of not having a hit.
[25:50.000 --> 26:00.000]  And he's had a lot of drug convictions and it's well-known that of your anti-establishment and have, you know, three strikes you're out.
[26:00.000 --> 26:12.000]  You'll go to prison but if you're a minion of the system like Rush Limbaugh with all the synthetic heroin pills, OxyCot and other things, a hundred a day that would kill multiple horses,
[26:12.000 --> 26:16.000]  such a tolerance he built up that, you know, you're allowed to do whatever you want.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  And Richard Nixon was a drug addict.
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  And so he's basically playing ball because he didn't want to go to prison.
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  And I didn't think much of that and I saw Flight 93, incredible hoax in forcing the official fable.
[26:31.000 --> 26:50.000]  And then he comes out with W, which is a resuscitation, a rehabilitation of George W. Bush, his father, the whole stinking system, just legitimizing all the crimes.
[26:50.000 --> 26:58.000]  There were people crying in the audience and neocons in there, people going, oh, for the president, it was disgusting.
[26:58.000 --> 27:07.000]  Observing for two hours, the crowd just sucking up the propaganda.
[27:07.000 --> 27:17.000]  And it's the perfect Neural Order shill to have Oliver Stone supposedly anti-establishment, anti-Republican come out with this film.
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  Because that's the key propagandist to have is somebody who's been trusted.
[27:24.000 --> 27:28.000]  And so W is a travesty.
[27:28.000 --> 27:37.000]  W is a horrible misrepresentation of the coincidence theory.
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.000]  You know, A, the president really does run things, there's no power elite behind him, there's no special interest.
[27:43.000 --> 27:57.000]  He meant well, they didn't lie to us, they misunderstood about the WMDs, though it's admitted that they forged Niger documents, yellow cake, aluminum tube documents, paid thousands of members of the press to put out false reports.
[27:57.000 --> 28:00.000]  That's in Congressional Budget Office admits that.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  Every case of it's illegal, a felony.
[28:03.000 --> 28:13.000]  I mean, if I went on and on the crimes this administration, hundreds of visits by gay porn stars and male madams at the White House at all hours of the day and night, none of that in there.
[28:13.000 --> 28:23.000]  He's just a nice family man, a Christian, who's an idiot Christian, who's a moron Christian, who really thought he was doing the Lord's work in Iraq.
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  It wasn't about trillions in weapons sales, it wasn't about a domestic police state, and again, spying on people's gotta be done to keep us safe.
[28:30.000 --> 28:35.000]  He's like, I want to keep the American people safe, we've got a spy on them to do it.
[28:35.000 --> 28:44.000]  There's WMDs, we know there are, we know there are, just all lives.
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.000]  You know, they'll show him chewing with his mouth open, but then it's cute and funny, and it's just, I mean, that's about as much as they attack him.
[28:51.000 --> 29:01.000]  And it's kind of cool how he's drunk with his little brother, running over trash cans in the front lawn with the car, and they show the earlier fraternity he was in before he was a junior and got tapers culling bones.
[29:01.000 --> 29:06.000]  And he's the cool fraternity guy, he knew how to answer all the questions and do it just right.
[29:06.000 --> 29:20.000]  I mean, it is a load of bull, it wasn't Bush being mean and burning people with coat hangers or sticking firecrackers and frogs butts and blowing them to pieces, live frogs, live toads.
[29:20.000 --> 29:27.000]  He would stick firecrackers in there behind in and their mouths and blow them to pieces.
[29:27.000 --> 29:33.000]  Same stuff Jeffrey Dahmer did, none of that. Disgusting Oliver Stone.
[29:33.000 --> 29:40.000]  So now Oliver Stone admits he can have his two hookers a day, his cocaine, his acid, all his liquor.
[29:40.000 --> 29:46.000]  He can just go around frying his brain and now the CIA run LAPD, I'll leave him alone.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  Well that's just great Oliver Stone, you destroyed yourself forever, destroyed your name.
[29:51.000 --> 30:20.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:21.000 --> 30:26.000]  Mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue and more.
[30:26.000 --> 30:32.000]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and potentially deadly toxins.

[33:13.000 --> 33:35.000]  I think I covered all the points.
[33:35.000 --> 33:43.000]  I think I covered just about everything.
[33:43.000 --> 33:55.000]  Bush's family was mean to him. They treated him bad. They didn't believe in him, but he was the underdog who showed them because he was an idiot savant.
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.000]  I've made the idiot savant point. I just hadn't made the point that he's like the underdog and they're all mean to him and never believe in him.
[34:03.000 --> 34:13.000]  But he fights back. I mean the whole thing is just total and complete propaganda.
[34:13.000 --> 34:27.000]  If there was any doubt that Oliver Stone was a propagandist for the dark side, this ended all that debate.
[34:27.000 --> 34:33.000]  Maybe all that acid and all those drugs. He admits he takes drugs every day. He brags about it in commentaries on films.
[34:33.000 --> 34:42.000]  They took acid and ecstasy and cocaine and methamphetamine when they made natural-born killers basically the whole time.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  It's on the extra. They're all tripping on the set.
[34:46.000 --> 34:52.000]  I just think Oliver Stone's brain's fried. I don't even think he really even makes these movies.
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  I think he's got subdirectors. In fact, I've been told that he basically just sits back now because he made Alexander himself, which was unwatchable.
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.000]  I mean it was like an after-school show or something. I watched like 45 minutes of it and had to turn it off a few years ago.
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  I mean I never turned movies off. I had to turn it off.
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  And then now these new films come out that are better done.
[35:15.000 --> 35:22.000]  Semantic, cinematic-wise, and the semantics are better. The whole way it's written is better.
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  Oliver Stone, no doubt, is very talented. Conan the Barbarian is a classic film, very well done.
[35:28.000 --> 35:33.000]  Do not confuse it with the horrible film that Oliver Stone wasn't involved with.
[35:33.000 --> 35:43.000]  Conan the Destroyer, absolutely unwatchable, low-budget, ridiculous, stupid, two totally separate films.
[35:43.000 --> 35:48.000]  But Oliver Stone and that Italian director did Conan the Barbarian.
[35:48.000 --> 35:56.000]  He's a very talented guy. He wrote and consulted on for De Palma, Scarface, excellent film.
[35:56.000 --> 36:07.000]  But I'm now getting off into film review here. The point is that the last point is, I may have made it last second, but I don't remember making it.
[36:07.000 --> 36:16.000]  I was told by people in Hollywood about two years ago that he was selling out to a certain extent.
[36:16.000 --> 36:24.000]  Then I had somebody else separate from those guys in Hollywood saying, look, he's got at least three convictions in California for cocaine.
[36:24.000 --> 36:33.000]  He's got other drug convictions around the country. If he gets any more drug convictions or he doesn't play ball, he's going to go to prison.
[36:33.000 --> 36:42.000]  He's on a bunch of different probations, and so they got him by the hair.
[36:42.000 --> 36:49.000]  That said, he's compromised, but you could tell he was selling out with any given Sunday.
[36:49.000 --> 36:59.000]  Well, that came out eight, nine years ago. The whole thing is the Knights Templars and the Aztecs and all the football teams have occultic names,
[36:59.000 --> 37:05.000]  and the whole thing is Illuminati Symbolism.
[37:05.000 --> 37:17.000]  And I know people that know Oliver Stone, folks. He knows all about this stuff, and I guess made a conscious decision to sell out to it under threat of duress. I don't know.
[37:17.000 --> 37:25.000]  But I've been told by two separate groups of Hollywood people, high level.
[37:25.000 --> 37:34.000]  You know, the entertainment media system is rife with people claiming inside high level info. Most of it's baloney.
[37:34.000 --> 37:41.000]  If I tell you something, you can put it in the bank.
[37:41.000 --> 37:48.000]  And then Willie Nelson on tomorrow.
[37:48.000 --> 37:56.000]  He may be on right at the start of the show, but I know he has an appointment or maybe a little bit later. We'll see. He'll be on the first two hours of the show tomorrow, scheduled sometime in those first two hours.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  Probably right at the start of the show if this appointment doesn't go over that he has.
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  That should be interesting, and don't forget we're going to be streaming live on the internet.
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  My speech, Ventura speech, Willie's speech, and then Willie's performance.
[38:10.000 --> 38:20.000]  And we're calling it the Peaceful Solution, Peace Revolution event.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  But it's an all day thing. There's a bunch of other great bands out there.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  Jimmy Vaughan's playing with another group, and then I'm told he's going to be playing some with Willie.
[38:28.000 --> 38:37.000]  But that's what I was told by Willie's people separately.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  I even asked Willie when I talked to him on the phone a couple of days ago about that.
[38:41.000 --> 38:49.000]  There'll be a lot of surprises at that event. It's the last, the backyard's been there for something like almost 30 years.
[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  And they're moving to a bigger venue because it only holds like 6,000, 7,000 people.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  They're moving to a bigger one because it was out in the hill country overlooking the hills.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  Now it's got a big shopping mall around it. It's all built up out there.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  So they're moving on down the road to a bigger place. I think it holds like 20,000 or something.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  Willie actually started the backyard with a, just named Tim O'Connor.
[39:11.000 --> 39:21.000]  But I'm already digressing. The point is I need to get all that honed out, honed down with Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Kurt Nemo.
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  You guys are on call Saturday night from New Mexico and London and Sheffield because I need you to make sure,
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  when we give you the live link to post on the main page, that evening we're going to have two different feeds from the cameras
[39:34.000 --> 39:42.000]  there. Taste Murphy's Law knocks one of them out of their problems for everybody with that.
[39:42.000 --> 39:53.000]  Okay, I am done talking about all of that now.
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.000]  I want to give the phone number out and I want to take your phone calls and cover news in the rest of this hour
[40:00.000 --> 40:14.000]  for all of the next hour. And then in studio, we have Tex Mars joining us in studio for an hour.
[40:14.000 --> 40:28.000]  And then we have Webster Griffin Tarpley on to talk about the election and the things that are heating up there as well in the fourth hour today.
[40:28.000 --> 40:40.000]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us. Any issue you wish to discuss,
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.000]  we will put you at the front of the line if you disagree. We do not screen your calls. I want to be clear.
[40:46.000 --> 40:52.000]  Your first name, you can make that up. Say your name is Billy Bomb.
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.000]  Say your name is Turnip Greens. Say your name is Easter Bunny for all I care.
[40:58.000 --> 41:03.000]  And you can tell us your calling from Atlantis. You can tell us your calling from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[41:03.000 --> 41:10.000]  I don't care. We do not screen your calls here. 1-800-259-9231.
[41:10.000 --> 41:17.000]  But if you wish to volunteer that you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[41:17.000 --> 41:29.000]  Because unlike mainstream liberal and conservative fake talk radio establishment, spew, pablum, baby food for the mind,
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  we aren't afraid of people disagreeing with us.
[41:33.000 --> 41:40.000]  Now that doesn't mean if somebody calls in and asks me why I'm the right hand man to the Pope,
[41:40.000 --> 41:46.000]  that I'm going to even sit there and entertain it because I'm not. I'm not even Catholic.
[41:46.000 --> 41:54.000]  Or if somebody calls in and asking me why I'm a reptoid. I mean, I'm not going to sit there and even entertain it.
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  I mean, I'll just laugh at you.
[42:01.000 --> 42:08.000]  All right. There's a lot of news that I have here in front of me that I want to go over.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  But let's just go ahead and take calls right now. Just the mainstream media is hyping.
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.000]  Biden came out yesterday. The French government came out in the last two days.
[42:18.000 --> 42:26.000]  The British government last week. They're all singing unison. Al Qaeda, Al Ciaida, is going to strike as soon as Barack Obama is elected
[42:26.000 --> 42:34.000]  or as soon as he's inaugurated in late January, what January 22nd, 23rd of next year to quote, test him.
[42:34.000 --> 42:41.000]  Now, why would the Arabs in their right mind, Muslims in their right mind, precipitate a terror strike
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.000]  that would bring in more military and more attacks on them?
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  Well, they wouldn't. I mean, that's common sense and who stands to benefit? Motive.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  And then you actually look at the evidence and you know, it's fake and made up.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  It has created real resistance fighters.
[42:56.000 --> 43:03.000]  Shiite, Sunni, Kurd and others being occupied for six plus years.
[43:03.000 --> 43:11.000]  Iraq has been under siege since 1990. So that's almost 18 years.
[43:11.000 --> 43:19.000]  3 million Iraqis are dead over a million of those in the last five and a half years of liberation being liberated from their lives.
[43:19.000 --> 43:27.000]  Now, the 3 million are refugees. It's a great crime committed in our names.
[43:27.000 --> 43:34.000]  And we are hearing the theories going to be some type of nuclear incident.
[43:34.000 --> 43:45.000]  Remember, U.S. News and World Report and others put out that Dick Cheney was saying we would be nuked before the election in 2004.
[43:45.000 --> 43:52.000]  And I went on there and said, I don't believe that's going to happen, but we have to take this threat very, very seriously
[43:52.000 --> 43:58.000]  because they could stage something because they're threatening it.
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  And then I got accused of saying that we were going to be nuked and we weren't.
[44:02.000 --> 44:08.000]  No, I read U.S. News and World Report and other publications and Cheney said we will be nuked.
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  They're not saying that now. They're saying there's a chance it could happen. They could get it.
[44:12.000 --> 44:18.000]  England is saying there's some huge coordinated attack coming, but they can't have any specifics.
[44:18.000 --> 44:27.000]  We know they stage terror events. There are real people who go into fish markets in Japan and stab the death, you know, six people yesterday.
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  That's terror right there. It's a crazy person. They're always on Prozac-type drugs. Every case I've seen in Japan.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.000]  They don't have any guns. They have mass stabbings every few days there.
[44:37.000 --> 44:43.000]  You know, you got a woman, like I said, walks on an Israeli bus to have 14 people killing five, six of them. That's terrorism.
[44:43.000 --> 44:50.000]  It's like a U.S. Apache firing Hellfire missiles into a schoolyard or into a market and killing a couple hundred people.
[44:50.000 --> 44:58.000]  I mean, that's terrorism of a terrorist. News on a flying helicopter went into a military base and hijacked an Apache and loaded it up with Hellfire missiles
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.000]  and flew into a sports stadium and blew up Americans. We'd call it terror.
[45:02.000 --> 45:12.000]  How is it terror when the Israelis or NATO, U.S. back forces all over the world from Serbia to Afghanistan blow up wedding parties, you name it?
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  Oh, that's collateral damage, and that's funny. Ha, ha, ha. People laugh about it. People go online and they make videos laughing and giggling,
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  showing videos of children, dogs being killed.
[45:22.000 --> 45:30.000]  And we're so dehumanized that when a family, a woman, a carload of kids gets blown up and the troops are laughing while they shoot them,
[45:30.000 --> 45:37.000]  that's funny. And YouTube will remove it saying it's anti-American to post that, that we're anti-trips.
[45:37.000 --> 45:43.000]  But before they remove it, there'll be Marines and Army on there and you can link back to their own YouTube and MySpace accounts.
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  They link to it and it'll be them in uniform laughing.
[45:46.000 --> 45:52.000]  Going, you know, hell yeah, let's kill some of these people. They're all a bunch of animals.
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.000]  Now that's a minority of the troops, but they're the ones that get promoted.
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  Remember Private Gruckheimer in the Ethic of Times?
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  2002, he comes home, he says, yeah, my tour in Afghanistan, we just go in every village and just kill every man, woman and child, including babies.
[46:06.000 --> 46:13.000]  And then Fox News put the head of the Afghan operation of general on TV saying, well, let's clarify,
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.000]  we only kill everybody in certain villages that we consider hostile.
[46:17.000 --> 46:21.000]  They go into every tent and they, so even the clarification admitted that.
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.000]  So let's not lie and say that we are the good guys by saying, no, this isn't our government.
[46:27.000 --> 46:34.000]  No, we have fraudulent voting machines, we have a dictatorship of Northcom, the military industrial complex, which is now admitted.
[46:34.000 --> 46:45.000]  Then we can get that guilt, at least partially, we let it come to this, but get it off of us internationally into the world ourselves and say,
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  we're not part of this, not in our name.
[46:47.000 --> 46:55.000]  And then we can truly redeem ourselves by going out and resisting it and speaking out against it and saying no to it.
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  It's that simple.
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.000]  But tell me this later, they're busy fear mongering everywhere that terrorists are about to attack any minute.
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  Give up all of your rights in Obama.
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  There's going to be an attack in Europe of the U.S.
[47:09.000 --> 47:14.000]  And then he'll be strong and blow the enemy to pieces and then you'll have all the neocons suddenly say, I like him.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  I guess he ain't a Muslim.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  I guess he's all right.
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  He ain't going into another country.
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  I like it, I like it.
[47:22.000 --> 47:27.000]  They can sit back and watch their TV and drink liquor and feel powerful.
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  I've talked to liquor store owners.
[47:29.000 --> 47:33.000]  I know every time there's a war, record amounts of liquor sold for weeks.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  Just men feeling manly through the war.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  Just sit back and get drunk every day.
[47:38.000 --> 47:44.000]  Oh, just watching, watching the military news and feeling all manly and oh, yeah.
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  Oh, yeah.
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.000]  So disgusting.
[47:49.000 --> 47:58.000]  It's such an abomination, such an abhorrent behavior degenerate.
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  That's true degeneracy.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  I mean, you know, having sex with 100 sex partners a year, that's unhealthy.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  It's dangerous.
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  And so you can call it degenerate.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  We're not supposed to behave like that, but I don't even particularly judge those people or hate them.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  I mean, I can understand how they could want to do it.
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.000]  But what true degeneracy is, is loving death, loving destruction, laughing at dead Iraqi children.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  And the public has been so dehumanized themselves.
[48:31.000 --> 48:37.000]  Their souls have been so blackened and hardened, their hearts that they'll cry over a dead puppy being shot by Marines.
[48:37.000 --> 48:42.000]  They'll be outraged, but they will just love dead Iraqi children.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  Rush Limbaugh, say, oh, they're just blowing off steam and having a good time at Abu Ghraib.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  That's a quote, by the way.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  How about you ever just want to have some fun?
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  Blow off some steam.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  All right, let's go to John and Ohio.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  John, you're on the air.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  Yeah, Alex.
[48:58.000 --> 49:09.000]  After that, you said so many important things there about the calluses of these armchair war mongers that I almost feel ashamed and not bringing this up.
[49:09.000 --> 49:20.000]  I think periodically I stifled myself, but you know how much I think you're doing a great job on the 9-11 truth issues on the police state,
[49:20.000 --> 49:27.000]  on exposing the lies behind these wars and the dehumanization of killing people in countries around the world.
[49:27.000 --> 49:35.000]  But I do have to say that I think now that we're in this situation of a move towards depression,
[49:35.000 --> 49:43.000]  that we do have to see some real alternatives that don't have to be demonized because if we do that, we're going to make...
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  Hey, John, there's not going to be a real socialist solution.
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.000]  And again, I'm against having helicopters dump money out on people because down the road it will just devalue the currency.
[49:52.000 --> 49:53.000]  Absolutely.
[49:53.000 --> 49:54.000]  But let me stop.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  I am for that before we just give it to international banks who are then going to use it to buy up what's left of our economy.
[50:00.000 --> 50:07.000]  Absolutely. It has nothing to do with socialism. It's fascism. It's the exact opposite.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  That is what Ron Paul and every other real economist has said on this.
[50:11.000 --> 50:16.000]  This is fascism. The media keeps calling it socialism. It is not socialism.
[50:16.000 --> 50:24.000]  It is not socialism, but the problem with the libertarian idea, and I would ask people to get Google up,
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.000]  Mr. Anonymous, the not-so-spontaneous libertarian. Mr. Anonymous, the not-so-spontaneous libertarian,
[50:31.000 --> 50:38.000]  because I think this libertarianism around much of what is on GCN, the so-called conservative movement,
[50:38.000 --> 50:46.000]  is really the most establishment line of all to a cold-hearted elimination of even the slightest safety
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  that people over the decades have forced on this government.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  Hey, John, communism doesn't work. Look at what...
[50:53.000 --> 50:56.000]  I'm going to come back to you and let you finish up when I have the time.
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.000]  Then we'll talk to Garen, Gavin, excuse me, and many others. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[52:01.000 --> 52:08.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:24.000 --> 52:31.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:35.000 --> 52:42.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.
[52:46.000 --> 52:54.000]  Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:54.000 --> 53:01.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[53:01.000 --> 53:07.000]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.000]  who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[53:11.000 --> 53:16.000]  Her face was every face I've ever known. Her face was my own face.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.
[53:21.000 --> 53:27.000]  A political thriller ripped from today's headlines, domestic spying, wiretapping, government chipping, and more.

[54:25.000 --> 54:41.000]  Welcome back at Frank Coliando, one of the most popular comedians in the United States on the first 12 minutes of the show.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  Tex Mars is going to be on in about an hour and five minutes in studio with us, and then Webster Tarpley.
[54:47.000 --> 54:53.000]  Alright, we're going back to John, then Gavin, Rourke, Steve, Dan, and others.
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  John, finish up your point.
[54:55.000 --> 55:02.000]  Yeah, well, you know, you can't finish it up in a couple minutes, but I would say that I would hope that we could get, for instance,
[55:02.000 --> 55:10.000]  some kind of a shortwave station like GCN that emphasizes a socialist perspective just for consideration.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  We are not just a shortwave station, sir.
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  Well, I understand, but I'm just saying that if they would have equal access, they certainly don't.
[55:16.000 --> 55:25.000]  We've been marinated for generations with falsifications, distortions by all the enemies of various varieties of socialism.
[55:25.000 --> 55:32.000]  People don't even know what it is. I listened to Jack McClann last week, and he calls Brzezinski the number one anti-communist, anti-Soviet,
[55:32.000 --> 55:39.000]  rabid fanatic in the world, the top communist, and the top socialist in this country with that kind of...
[55:39.000 --> 55:47.000]  Well, Jack McClann, Brzezinski claims he's anti-Soviet, but in truth, he did support Paul Pot.
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  Well, he supported Paul Pot, and Paul Pot was anti-communist.
[55:51.000 --> 55:59.000]  The point I'm making is he's been a rabid anti-Soviet and anti-communist with this kind of incredible delusional and hallucinations
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.000]  about who is a communist and who isn't. There's no way that you can make any kind of a judgment.
[56:05.000 --> 56:15.000]  What I'm saying is that if we would have something like workersorg or wsws.org regularly, or having their own channels of communication,
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  I think people would begin to see that...
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.000]  Yeah, but the socialist, you know, if they don't have big foundation money, they don't know how to go out, I guess,
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  and get sponsors and actually be like the evil free market people.
[56:25.000 --> 56:31.000]  Look, this is not a free market that we have with private banks issuing and controlling the currency
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  and using government to go and basically shut down banks and brokerage houses that they don't control
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  and using government to pipe the people's money to it.
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  That's what I always say. Every time you get a big government, you get a tiny group, whether it's communism, fascism,
[56:44.000 --> 56:50.000]  it doesn't matter, that uses those levers to consolidate control. That's human nature.
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  It's not human nature. It's not a function of government. It's a function of capitalism.
[56:54.000 --> 57:01.000]  That is the inevitable result of the sharks of capitalism eating the smaller sharks over the decades of history.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  The answer is decentralization, local government, and true freedom, my friend.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  Well, decentralization is really a trick when you have the monopoly control of the credit.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  A really big government is what has allowed and fraudulent government is what allowed the banks to do this.
[57:15.000 --> 57:21.000]  All I'm saying is in a real world where the monopoly credit is controlled by Wall Street on a global basis,
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.000]  decentralization and the idea that you're going to have more power is going to absolutely trap you into being totally...
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  John, I'm talking real world here. Look at how the left has helped build up the structure for world government.
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.000]  And now, you know, the banks always financed it and they always financed the socialists at the UN.
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  Hold on. Hold on. And now, oh, you make your point.
[57:40.000 --> 57:47.000]  And now they're using that to set up world government of and for and by the crony robber barons.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  I don't even call them capitalists.
[57:49.000 --> 57:55.000]  In my reality, if you just look at the 50 years terrorism we've imposed against Cuba, the invasions,
[57:55.000 --> 58:00.000]  the use of germ warfare, the assassination attempts, operation Northwood to murder Americans,
[58:00.000 --> 58:06.000]  to frame them up and to say that we brought them to power, I mean, it's delusional.
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  And this kind of a britchide attitude, I think...
[58:09.000 --> 58:16.000]  No, it's not delusional that the military industrial complex builds enemies and then has wars with them.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  From the very beginning, they had this attempt to assassinate...
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.000]  Well, let's get something straight. I didn't learn what I know from the John Birch Society.
[58:24.000 --> 58:30.000]  I learned it from reading globalist documents and from going to college here locally and hearing the propaganda.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  Okay, so, you know, let's be straight about that.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  The Birchers don't even think 9-11 was an inside job.
[58:37.000 --> 58:47.000]  Thank you, John. We'll be right back.
[59:08.000 --> 59:17.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[59:17.000 --> 59:23.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[59:23.000 --> 59:30.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[59:34.000 --> 59:37.000]  Now it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  We're taking your phone calls in the shower and covering a ton of really important news that I'll be going over starting at the bottom of the hour, but continuing with calls.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Right now, let's go to Gavin in Texas.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  Gavin, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  Hey, thank you very much. I've been listening to your shows since 2001 before 9-11.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  I saw you propose the idea of attack and whatnot, and then I was convinced that you were on or something, but that's not why I'm calling.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  I'm calling to say to those that are listening, if you don't wake up, it doesn't really matter. Your family and many others will die, and that's going to cause a true awakening.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  I've got to go back to work. I love for y'all, and thank you very much, Alex.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Thank you, Gavin, for the call. Yes, the global elite running things created the fascists, the communists that killed 200 million people alone last century, and this is real.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  I mean, this is not a game. I'm sorry, the truth is so hardcore.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Rourke in Texas, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Hi, Alex. I have a spiel about communism I'd like to go over, and I hope you'll let me run with it.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Okay, go ahead.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  All right. When you think about the word commune, you think about hippies in Oregon or the Kibbutz in Israel.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  When you think about communism, you think about Stalin Mao and the Gulag Archipelago.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  When you have two opposite ideas about a single idea, and you're unaware of it, that's double-think, which is brainwash.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Lives become propaganda, become brainwash. So therefore, either commune being the root word of communism or communism must be a lie.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  I think it's easy to see that communism is the lie, and the exploit in the communist manifesto is in the first line.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Dictatorship of the proletariat. Dictatorship is fascism. It's not imperialism because it's pulled from a party.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  They always get the working class to claim that they're attacking the elite, but really it's the elite always directing the working class
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  against the middle class, the hereditary enemy of the elite.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I think it's more than that. How is it that the poor of a country can afford an army to defeat the imperial forces in their country?
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  They're funded by a foreign bank.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Yes, so the Queen of England has been getting rid of her competition on the Eurasian continent.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And you can't explain that to these dive-in-the-wool socialists.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Yeah, but see, that and central planning, which is also fascism because few control the entire manufacturing base, makes communism really fascism with a communist front.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  That's right. It's all command and control. It says, Carol quickly said, and again, that book internally was used by the State Department of Foreign Service and CIA
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  for their high-level people to know how the world really worked, and it's exactly what we say here.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  There was a far-reaching plan by the international banking families to fund communism and fascism to consolidate control and enslave the population.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  And then the public debates within that left-right paradigm.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  Never getting outside the box, never truly causing a real revolution against the tyrants.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  I found this Jordan Maxwell's basic slideshow, and in there he has a book called The California Legislature, 11th Report,
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  Senate Investigating Committee on Education, 1953, and it reads,
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  The communist conspirators thereupon conceived the plan for the future of the supplementing of the long-established secret conspiracy in existence since May 1, 1776,
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  with an unremitting public campaign for the victims among the ignorant of all nations and in an attempt to hide from the view the underlying hypocritical conspiracy
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  existing since May 1, 1776. It was decided that in such public campaign, the manifesto of 1848 should be heralded as the founding date of communism and Karl Marx falsely proclaimed as his author.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  And I think Karl Marx was a mason. The first Russian communist convention was in London in 1905.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  We're out of time for this call. Stay with us. More calls right ahead.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com. Or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  I know as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children, checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  But mostly providing for my family and knowing that they are secure, that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins. They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  I've always wanted to be a good provider. And I'm not going to change that now, just because the economy is in up evil.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  There's a lot of political and social uncertainty. And I hear about global famines, and I see the escalating prices in gas and food and oil. Electricity is going to go way up until this winter.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Hey, I'm not going to sweat it. I've done the right thing. I got rid of a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage. I converted that money into food.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  That food's out there. I've got a two or three year supply of food in the garage. My family's secure. I don't got to worry, okay?
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security. Call eFoodsDirect.com. That's eFoodsDirect.com, or 1-800-409-5633. That's 800-409-5633.

[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  Call 908-6912608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  All right, Steve, Dan, many others that are holding their calls are coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Then we'll get into nuclear incident with make 9-11 insignificant. That's what a worldwide commission is saying, getting us ready for that.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  DPB chief, Sir Kevin McDonald, attacks Big Brother State surveillance.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  London Times saying England is a total Big Brother control grid, and you may have seen nothing yet. World Wildlife Fund, which is a eugenics front, resorts to deception and climate fear mongering, caught red-handed.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  The PrisonPlanet.com article will be going over.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Interpol details plans for global biometric facial scan database.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  That's infowars.net. Steve Watson, London Guardian, others reporting on it. Big news there, what that'll mean to everybody.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  Obama's carbon ultimatum, the coming offer. You won't be able to refuse global taxes. Wall Street Journal.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Another great story from bluerockwell.com. Environmentalism is racism. That's what it was set up to do, is to freeze the third world so they can't industrialize.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  That's in mainline government documents.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Also, the financial news. Fed launching new effort to help out money funds. That means give money to their own companies.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  That includes the public treasury. That is just some of what is coming up today.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  But once a month he joins us and I always enjoy it because not only is it a great product, not only is he a great sponsor,
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  I believe in getting people outside of the box and outside of the system and just to briefly explain it.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  After Germany was captured, and this happened somewhat before, but they were the masters of chemistry and new systems.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  The pressures of Nazi Germany not having a lot of oil. They learned how to get it out of coal shales.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  They learned how to make soap, which is really a toxic detergent out of oil byproducts.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Procter and Gamble and others picked this up and so you end up paying more money for really toxic waste.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And then old fashioned soap and cleaning products were eradicated.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  And he's been around since 1947. That's quite a long time, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  1947. And he started with his father. He, of course, is in World War II in the Chemical Corp.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  He's Marty Shacker. And his son is also there. It's a Calben pure soap company.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  They're local in California. And because you go directly to the manufacturer, you get on average about 85% off supermarket prices.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Tough economy. This is a way to really save money. And it's real.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Been around again for 60 years. And they're just great folks. Marty, it's good to have you here with us.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  It's a pleasure talking to you and your listeners, Alex. It's once a month I look forward to it.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  It's so exciting to relate the information and the knowledge to save the consumers, to save the listeners a barrel full of money,
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  and giving them products twice as good as what they're using now.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  Yeah, we don't hear the big establishment environmentalists. Well, thank you that are grabbing all the property and destroying free market
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  and taxing people with phony environmentalism. You never hear them talk about going back to clean, healthy, real soap.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  I mean, I could ask a lot of questions, Marty, but what's most important for people to know?
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  Well, important to know they're interested in three things. Their health, their well-being, and their finances.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  And this is where we are on top of everyone in the whole country. I mean, we're talking about purchasing cleaning products.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  A one-to-two-year supply, which is 65 pounds, is equal to 1,000 pounds. That comes out to $3 per week.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Three-to-four-year supply, which is 145 pounds, equal to 2,000 pounds. That's a ton. 250 per week.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  Four-to-five-year supply, which is 210 pounds, that's 3,000 pounds, a ton and a half, that you don't have to buy $2 a week.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  What's it costing you now? It's costing you $20 a week. I can prove it. I got statistical evidence, $20 a week,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  where your money's going down the drain with nothing to show for it. We say, why don't you put your money up the drain for a change?
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  And that's what we do. That's our career, that's my life. This is what I've been doing, going on 61 years now.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Save money, save the environment, save your clothing, save your skin, save your machines, save, save, save. That's our model.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  That's right. Up on 5starsope.com, just the number 5starsope.com, or you can spell it out, 5starsope.com.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  You have your California organic certificates. That's the highest standard in the country.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  And so many problems with asthma, rashes, you name it. But instead of bashing the toxic waste that's sold as cleaning products,
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  let's talk about your products. Talk about being organic when organic wasn't even understood.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Kind of back to the future. Break down what's in your products.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  So basically the products of detergents sold by these billion dollar corporations are all made, as you say,
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  from waste petroleum products converted into a detergent. We don't believe in that. We don't use that word.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  It's a poison word for us. We make soap, old fashioned soap from the 18th, 19th and early 20th century
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  when it was absolutely gone from the marketplace. We're talking about soaps made from natural coconut oils, vegetable oils.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  We don't use perfumes which are toxic. We use natural oils from oranges, from honey, from lemons.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  This is what we do. This is our career. This is our life. And we decided to go factory direct, not to the corporations,
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  not to the hospitals, not to the schools, not to the convalescent homes, which was the base of our business
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  for decades. We decided four years ago, when I made my connection to Genesis Communication Network,
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  when I was called, it says, hey, why don't you sell to the families? Why don't you sell direct to our listeners?
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  And that really put the bulb on. I said, my God, I never thought of that. That's a great idea.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  This is what we're doing, going factory direct to Alex Jones listeners, giving them the best buy, the best products.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  Nothing can be compared to twice as good. And this we guarantee it unconditionally.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  Well, Marty, you just covered the key there. Big hospitals, nicer nursing homes, five-star hotels.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  They, for now 60-something years, buy from you because the establishment's smart. They're not stupid.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  They want to save money and have real soap. That's only for the idiot public to have the deadly detergents and the toxic poisons.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  So, I mean, again, I can't find words enough to sell people on the fact that they need to call and get a brochure.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  They need to check it out online. They need to get the sampler tote bag. Tell folks about the sampler tote bag.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  Well, first of all, free catalogs describes everything, plus being on the web describes everything.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  And we put together a one- to two-month supply of pure soap products.
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  It weighs out about six pounds. It's got four bars of our pure soap, nothing like it in the nation.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  It's got an 18-ounce jar of our granulated laundry soap, not detergent, with a little tiny scoop to measure it out.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  16 ounces, which is a pint in a dispenser bottle of our triple concentrated cocoa butter shampoo, nothing like it when you use it.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  You will rave. That's what we get. The problem with our products is they last too long. That's the complaints we get.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  You also get a 16-ounce pint dispenser bottle of our liquid cream dish soap for pots, for pans, for utensils, for mop and the floor,
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:48.000]  for doing the windows, for washing your hands. All purpose, doesn't hurt, doesn't harm, doesn't pollute, doesn't burn.
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  It contains, and this is basically whatever we do. The products contain no useless dyes, perfumes, chlorides, allos, glycerins, conditioners, foods, vitamins,
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  chemicals, antibacterials, paraffins, acids, lanolins, detergents, deodorants, doesn't contain any crap. Don't need it anymore.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  Are you tired of supporting these billion-dollar corporations? You come to me, we take care of you. We're family-owned, family-operated.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  By the way, you're not going to need your lint collector anymore in your prior because, explain to people, these detergents eat your clothes.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  What is it, you know, they say, stronger than dirt. That's the main commercial. It is strong. It's too strong. The products are too strong.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  When they go into a washing machine, they microscopically break down the soil, they also microscopically break down the fibers,
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  and they turn into lint when they go into the dryer. Lint is broken clothing. What is lint? Why do we have lint?
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Why does the newest dryers have a drawer to pull out to collect this lint, which is your clothing, which is only going to last you 60 or 90 days, diapers, baby clothes,
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  think of the past. No hand-me-downs because they deteriorate. The clothes are clean, too clean, and again, broken-down fibers, deterioration, not economically good for you.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  All right, give folks the toll-free number they want to call and get the sample tote bag or go ahead and get your supplier months ago.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  800-340-7091. We've got people here, my family's all waiting for your calls. 800-340-7091. You can put a 1 in front of it.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  Some places you don't need a 1, but that's what it is, and you can see it on the web. 5starstop.com. 5 the number. 5 the letter. We're there. We're waiting for you. We're guarantee everything.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  Give the number.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  You're satisfied. You'll never use anything else.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Give the number again.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  800-340-7091. 1-800-340-7091.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  Or 5starsub.com. We've got about 60 seconds. Give me a limerick.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  A cute little babe from St. Paul wore a newspaper dress to a ball, but the dress caught on fire and burned her entire front page, sporting section, and all.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Marty, again, 5starsub.com folks. It's great. I believe in an only push. If you hear me verbally endorse something, that means it's my sponsor and I believe in it.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  And I'm just glad that we found you. And again, they gave me a year supply of it. I just gave it to my wife and she's like, a year later. I want more of that.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  Man, that's great stuff. And I remember smelling the bar soap. Oh, that cherry essence and almond oil. Marty, thanks for coming on with us.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  Thank you, Alex. I appreciate that very much. And I look forward to hearing from you. Listen.

[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Hi, John Humner from Mitus Resources.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Are you tired of watching your hard earned assets dwindle away?
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of 20 billion a week,
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard earned money?
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  How much are you willing to lose?
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  Take action now. Call me at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.

[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.

[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  Steve and Dan and Paul and Anna and Rebecca and others.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  The toll free number to join us is 800-25 at 992-31.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  We're here trying to alert the public to the criminal world elite that are carrying out mass eugenics operations against free humanity.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  The time is running out, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  It is now time to activate, take action, and wake up as many people as you possibly can.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  This isn't some distant threat. This is here upon us now.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Steve and Feronto. You're on the air, Steve.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Hey Alex, you're the best. Thanks for taking my call.
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Yeah, I've been trying to wake up people up here since the 80s. I remember when this woman came up to my door in 1986,
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  knocking on the door, and she was trying to tell me that they're going to have microchips in her hands,
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  and she was giving me all these revelations from the Bible, and I was blown away.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  I was only nine years old, and ever since then I was trying to tell people there's something wrong,
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  even though I didn't know for sure what it was.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  But for years and years, I've been talking to people, and it just seems that people are just so passive,
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  appear and so brain dead.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  No, they are mesmerized by watching adults close to four hours, children more than four hours of television
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  that physically, scientifically, this is admitted, mesmerizes them and puts them into a dream state.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  So the public out there listening, if you're tuning through on the AM or FM dial laughing right now,
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  listen, Bobba, you've been put in a pacified position.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  It's true, and you know that's funny, right now there's this zombie culture going on with zombie movies,
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  and people up here will get together and dress like zombies and walk the streets, and I'm like,
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  are you, I'm like, it's so ironic.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  Yeah, that's a nice mascot for them, because they really are zombies, spiritually and mentally.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Exactly.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Hey, listen to this, every couple of weeks, I see an article or some high school junior or senior,
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  sometimes middle school, writes a story about zombies attacking a high school,
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  because that's in, you know, the scores of movies and culture.
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  I got an A plus for English in like seventh grade for a story about zombies attacking the school,
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  and me and my football buddies were defeating them, and of course we didn't have cars yet,
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  but in the story we had cars.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  And literally, I saw a story a few days ago in Kentucky, the senior, no criminal record, good guy,
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  his parents were divorced, so he lives with his grandparents, they were reading his journal,
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  and they admitted, it was in the news, that it was in his, that it was in his English, you know, folder,
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  where zombies attack a nondescript high school, separate from his, not even naming names,
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  and he has been arrested, and the police were in the news, I meant to get to it, saying,
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  we know it's not this high school, we know it's fictional, but still, he's going to jail,
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  and he's on $5,000 bond and facing all these years in prison for terroristic threats and planning terrorism.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  I mean, you can go pull the article up, just Google teen arrested for story in Kentucky,
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  and the police say, we know it's not real, so see, that's a thought crime now.
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  But see, his grandparents turned him in.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Wow.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Go ahead and make your point.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  It's just, I don't know, I'm just saying, it's a brain-dead culture now, and I feel like it's like,
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  I've been trying to wake people up, and it's very hard, like, I pass out copies of, you know,
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  your films, other people's films too, whatever, you know, I give them at least a variety,
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  and, you know, no one, people, oh, I partly wash it, you know, and whatever, I don't have time,
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  and then they'll come up to me and go, oh, dude, you got to see these guys, man, you got to see it.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  And I'm like, oh, God, no.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  You know, it's like, wait, you know, it's like, because he, I mean, even he used clips from your films
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  and other people, or Bill Hicks and whatever.
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  Meanwhile, like, he doesn't give their full view, just these little things that help, right?
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  And I try to-
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  But see, the key is, it's Delphi technique and others.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  I mean, they have corporate seminars on this, and I've been told by big broadcasting executives,
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  people I've run into that, Alex, you've got a distinctive voice, and it's really good,
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  but it actually wakes people up, and they say, well, it's really slick,
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  but that's not my voice, is this and a cadence.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  Everything's all right.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  It's the soothingness.
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  Everybody's designed to be soothed by TV, to be soothed into relaxing,
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  and so it's that soothing way.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  Have you noticed how politicians will talk to you?
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  How when a mayor's taking people's private property, they'll say it's for the earth.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  You'll be taken care of.
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  There's nothing to worry about.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  Everything's all right, okay?
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  Well, that's what most university students here in Canada have come out like,
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:26.000]  you know, taking philosophy and politics end up sounding like,
[1:29:26.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  I mean, and they're insulted when I tell them, you know, what's really going on
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  or what to refer to, and they're completely insulted,
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  and they actually come up with the same ideas that he has.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  And I think it's just the...
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  Yeah, it's just the talking universities.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  People are in a comfort bubble, and they don't want that comfort bubble violated.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  I'm going to explain this when we get back and take more calls.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  Stay with us. Great call.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Here's a startling fact.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  The New World Order wants you dead.
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  Chemicals and toxins are in the air.
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  Biowarfare, drugs and unknown substances.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  Foods with no vitamins.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  Fast food for obesity.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  Fluoride in our water.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  How do we fight back?
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  What do we do?
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  Make a life-change decision.

[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.000]  And for about a dollar a day, you can win the race.
[1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  GettheT.com.

[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  Don't be deceived by the bullies of the trade.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  But who is the enemy?
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  Bin Laden.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  This is his MO.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  The hijackers' ties to the FBI.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000]  The Israeli intelligence network.
[1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  Warnings in war games.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  The shadow government.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  And much, much more.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  What does humidity mean to you?
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  That's why I'd like you to visit

[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  He's calling the distance.
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  He's going for speed.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  She's all alone.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  What it's all about going the distance
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  year after year pounding the new world order.
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  Racing and racing and plodding the course.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  He's plodding and plodding and plodding on his horse.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  He's going the distance.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  Frontline to the info war.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  You found it.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  No trophy, no flowers, no flashballs, no line.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  He's haunted by something he cannot define.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  Bowl shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse.
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  Assail him, impale him with muscle truck force.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  In his mind he's still driving, still making the grade.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  She's hoping in time that her memories will fade.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Because he's racing and pacing and plodding the course.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  He's fighting and fighting and riding on his horse.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  The sun's gone down and the moon's come up.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  And long ago somebody left with a cup.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  But he's driving and driving and hugging the turns.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  And thinking of someone for whom he still burns.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  He's going the distance.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  What it's all about.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  Alright, we're back live.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  Look, humans are creatures of comfort and creatures of habit.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  We get comfortable in this nice grid.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  With the Madison Avenue billboards and radio and TV.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  The movies, the culture.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  We're immersed, or as a caller said in the last hour,
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  in Ohio, marinated in this system.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  And in subsystems of thought and propaganda.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  And I've noticed things.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  Going to films maybe once a month for most of my adult life.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  I don't watch a lot of TV, but I do go to a movie or so.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  At least once a month I enjoy the cinema.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  And I enjoy analyzing the crowds, the looks on their faces.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  More often than not, I'm not watching the screen.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  I'm not in suspended disbelief.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  I'm watching at them and seeing what their reactions are.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  And I've noticed that we're degenerating into a bunch of animals.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  People now will text message.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  They will talk on their cell phones.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  It doesn't matter if it's in a nice part of town or a poor part of town.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  People do not want to get up for you to go to the bathroom or to get more popcorn.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  They do not want to move their knees to even let you get into your seat.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  They will get angry at you.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  I went to see W and they were doing it to other people that were going past them.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  They just wouldn't move their knees.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  They just didn't look at you.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  It's a selfishness.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  More and more I grew up in Texas and people let you in in traffic.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  I still do it, but more and more they don't.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  I live in Mexico City or Moscow or something.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  Everybody honking at each other.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  The culture is changing and so people are so selfish.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  There's a million examples of this.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  People not taking care of their parents.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  It's not even going to visit them.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  Not working even an extra job to get them a better nursing home, even if you have to do that.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  They just deny it.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  They rationalize.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  They make excuses.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  A country that's had 50 million abortions.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Even if you're four abortions and aren't saying they're human beings, which they clearly are,
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  it's very lazy to have your form of birth control,
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  being murdering the unborn child and dehumanizing life itself and dehumanizing the Iraqis
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  and dehumanizing everybody else for that matter and euthanizing the elderly
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  and making it fashionable and cool and like it's some wonderful right.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  Now as the state pushes to euthanize people and has been caught doing it all over the world.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  And so people are so selfish that they don't want to hear about a new rule of order.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  They don't want to hear about police corruption.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  They don't want to hear about over taxation and regulation.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  Even if it's hurting them, they're so myopic, so focused on themselves for a host of reasons.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  But one of them is they don't want to admit there's an elite or corrupt establishment or scary powers that be.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  And they don't want to admit that they have personal power and could have a destiny
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  and be involved in engaging tyranny and resisting it.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  And a lot of them deep down know there's a tyranny and are scared to face it.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  And so they selfishly, as a coward does, rationalize and tell themselves it doesn't exist
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  because they are too afraid to even admit it's real to themselves.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  And they don't want to hear it's a hard fight against the new rule of order
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  and they're already in desperate straits.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  We have a chance of beating it, but it's diminishing.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  They want to live in denial.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  And so they like groups and people and Barack Obama or John McCain with their easy solutions
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  and the state loves you and the government likes you and good guys are running in.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  The government's just inept. There's no big problem.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  You know, shots aren't bad for you or your dog or cat.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  You know, they're not bad for your children.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  There's no poison in the water. They don't put it there on purpose.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  And they didn't know Prozac made people kill themselves. Of course, they did when they tested it in 82.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  But, you know, everything's all right.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Now, the flu shot protects you from the flu.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  It doesn't matter that it, well, in the last at least six years,
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  they haven't picked the right one the year before that would mutate, so it doesn't protect you.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  It doesn't matter. These experimental shots they give the troops are killing them.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  Just say it doesn't exist. Say it's okay.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  They'll say everything's all right because if you admitted that even 5% of what I'm saying and others are saying is true,
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  you'd have to do something about it. Well, I got news for you boys and girls.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  I'm about 95% accurate. And the 5% of the time I'm wrong, it's over just a number or a date or some minutia.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  We try to tell the truth. We have a great track record and a believable track record of being accurate.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  We are closer than anybody else out there I know of to the view of how the world really ticks and really operates
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  because we go off how the new world order in its even public global planning document states the world really works.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  I mean, when you get something the CIA and State Department used for its internal people to understand the true history of the United States and Europe,
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  and then it gets out into full publication, tragedy and hope, 900 and something pages,
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  and you better believe that's exactly how things work and that's exactly the world we're in, written in 68.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  And you read a Club of Rome document from 91 or a Royal Commission on Population from 1949.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  And it all came true. It all happened just like they said they were going to do it.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  And they tell the lazy public, oh, none of that exists. The government can't tie its shoelaces.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  We just have all the volumes where they say exactly what they're doing.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  Let me tell people that serve the system something. We have the documents they put cancer viruses in your shots, buddy.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  We have the documents they put sodium fluoride under toxins to hurt you and brain damage you and calcify your glands.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  It's a fact. You understand? It's a fact TV brain washes you and puts you into a lower brain state
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  and mesmerizes you in a sleep state, waking sleep state, like sleepwalking.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  It's a fact there's a world government. It's a fact 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  It's a fact Oklahoma City was an inside job. It's a fact the first World Trade Center bombing was provocateur.
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  It's a fact the Gulf of Tonkin was staged. It's a fact the USS Liberty was premeditatedly attacked,
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  to blame it on Egypt and start World War III. It's a fact that Georgia U.S. back-snuck attack Russia.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  It's a fact the Federal Security Bureau and Russia state bombings on their own buildings for a police state pretext.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  I said I'd take your calls. The point is don't blame me because I had the will that when I discovered real history
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  and discovered what was really going on in the world that I made a decision and a commitment 15 years ago
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  and for 13 years on air to become highly informed and highly motivated
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  and to try to spur others to become highly motivated to fight tyranny.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  Don't be mad at me because I tell you the truth. Don't be mad at me because I tell you there's bad people in the world.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  Don't be angry with me because I'm telling you that there's massive growing corruption in high places worldwide.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  Denying it doesn't protect you. Denying that there are those dangers doesn't protect you.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  Like an innocent two-year-old child riding in their car seat in a car.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  When another car has a blowout in front of it and turns sideways and flips
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  and that SUV or that car plows head on into it and that car flips killing everybody on board.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  That two-year-old didn't understand that. That two-year-old was a little toddler, a baby
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  and I don't blame a two-year-old for not knowing how dangerous the highways are.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  That's the same thing with government and tyranny and history.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  I don't blame two and three and four-year-olds and five-year-olds
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  but my six-year-old son now knows more about history and more about the nature of government
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  than most adults and that is shameful and you are like little babies who live in denial.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  A lot of people who are, quote, awake get sucked into the COINTELPRO and the infighting and the rest of it
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  and the reason they get sucked into it is because it's easier to infight and backseat quarterback
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  and complain than actually become leaders and try to actually go out and wake people up
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  on what we can prove and the basic issues that we know.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  I'm not really going to the calls quick.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Dan, Paula, and Rebecca at others.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Dan in New York, you're on the air.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  I was just going to say about the whole socialism and the bailout.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  That's not socialism. That's a form of corporatism.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  It is.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  I believe Benino Mussolini said it best.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  You know who he is but a lot of collars might not know.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  He's the fastest leader, came to power in the 20s.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  Mr. Hitler, well, he basically said corporatism and fascism are the same thing.
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  Even my global teacher who disagrees and says the Patriot Act is unconstitutional
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  says that this is a form of corporatism that we're coming to.
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  It is. It is a global corporate state where they socialize our wealth
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  but not to be redistributed to us.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  It never does. The elites always keep it under whatever name it is,
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.000]  but it's all transferred to them to the social engineer us.
[1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  Yeah, exactly. Right there, Alex.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  You got it right on the head, Bob.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  I mean, folks, they stage the 9-11 attacks.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  You don't think they won't put in voting machines to steal elections?
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  Of course they are. They're going for broke.
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  They're going the distance.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  And it's going to take a complete commitment against these people
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  to have any chance because their end game is killing everybody.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  Yeah, exactly. People say Barack Obama is going to help the economy.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  The only thing he's going to do is make guns illegal.
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  And even worse, probably make our economy more socialistic.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  I was in a gun shop about nine months ago and saw some flyers about Obama
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  and then I was in one again about a month ago buying some ammo to go shooting.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  And they had some literature there.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  And I knew he was anti-gun, but I hadn't fully believed the rhetoric
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  and I picked up the pamphlet.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  And when I got back to town, I was out in the countryside.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  I got back to town a few days later.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  I went and looked at the Senate record.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  I went and looked at his Senate record, not just in federally,
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  but in the state of Illinois.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  And he openly says ban all 308 and 223 rounds, rifles that fire it.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  Folks, 223 and 308, that's like 35, 40%.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  But if you can ban those main cartridge rounds, the NATO round,
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  you can, both those are a NATO round, well, the 308's the main NATO round,
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  you can ban it all.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  I mean, this guy really means it.
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  Oh man, we're in trouble.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  On the Second Amendment, he constantly says he's for the Second Amendment,
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  but then he voted for almost every gun ban that there has been.
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  Well, how the spin works is we're for the Second Amendment,
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  but the Second Amendment says only the National Guard,
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  which they call the militia, but that wasn't set up until 1906.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  And all the records show it's an individual right.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  Yeah, I mean, I can understand gun laws,
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  but I can't understand total gun bans.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  Well, you can't have gun laws.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  Criminals are always going to violate the law.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  Okay, we need more guns, less crime.
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  I mean, you know, 150 years ago, all over the country,
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  when you got out of prison, they gave you your guns back.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  And I believe in that.
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  I believe in that.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  I don't believe felons should be barred from owning guns.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  But you know what?
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  You engage in a violent crime with a gun.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  You need to go away forever.
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  I mean, I really want freedom.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  I really want the whole big fat enchilada.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  I want it all. I'm ready for it.
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  I want it.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  All right, Paul in California, go ahead.
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  Hey, Paul, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  Welcome.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  I would like to recommend that you make common cause
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  with those people whom you refer to as illegal aliens.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  Well, I do have a common cause.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  They're human beings. I'm against them having toxic waste
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  dumped on them all over Mexico from the U.S.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  I'm against eugenics, farms, euthanizing their babies
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  here in the U.S., targeting brown people for extermination,
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  which is all living the way it's sold.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  But look, in the new world orders for private federal banks,
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  with federal power, I'm against it.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  In the new world orders for open borders, I'm against it.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  In the new world orders for fluoridating water, I'm against it.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  If they were forced into inoculations, I'm against it.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  Because everything they do is bad.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  So the poor people in Mexico have their land stolen
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  by the United Nations, by the IMF, by the World Bank.
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  They've been forced off of it in the last 15 years.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  Off their ancestral land, they don't want to come here.
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  Then they're sent here to bankrupt the economy
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  and bankrupt the states.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  And I'm not against them individually,
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  but I understand they're being used.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  Yes, they are victims of the new world order,
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  more so than folks like you and I who are of the privileged group.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  But we're not going to be the privileged group long.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  That's the whole point.
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  They want world feudalism.
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  And so they flood first world nations with multi-tiered systems
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  with second class people, first to second to third class.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  They only want a giant slave class and then a first class.
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  So they're flooding the United States to bankrupt everything
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  and to drive down wages, brother.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  And it's not helping Mexico.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  If we would have let none of these illegal aliens in,
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  we'd have higher wages here.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  We'd have a higher standard of living,
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  and then they would have already had rebellions
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  and guaranteed they've exported their revolution here, sir.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  One thing, Alex, you should recognize though,
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  when you look at these people,
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  you should realize that they are descended from the Mayans,
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  the Aztecs, the indigenous peoples of Central and South America.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  They have more of a claim to this land than the Europeans do.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  Well, you see the whole already conquista Ford Foundation,
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  Annenberg Foundation, Liberation Theology,
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  pumped in in the 50s and 60s and 70s.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  They claim it's an Aztec kingdom all the way up into Canada,
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  and it's not.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  And they have horrible racism in Mexico
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  towards Native Americans in Central North America.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  So it's a Mesoamerican attitude, elite tribalism, sir.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  People think only whites are tribal, only Anglos are tribal.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  But that's not how it works.
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  And so the Liberation Theology has been pumped into these people.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  I can rise above it.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  And I don't dislike them personally because of their brainwashing,
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  but I'm not going to sit here and not report on what I read
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  in Mexican newspapers and Spanish papers in Texas
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  and what's on radio and TV.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  And if we're going to get you gringo, you're the devil,
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  we're going to take you down, it's over, pilgrim,
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  you're going to go back, we're going to get you.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  And that's all funded by the banks.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  And so I will report on that.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  And I think that's a really fascinating view.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  Well, when I hear you refer to Mexicans and illegal aliens,
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  you should realize that these are human beings
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  they want to survive just like anybody else.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  I know, and they would survive better if they took their country back.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  But they've got a culture of corruption,
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  so they probably will never be able to.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  And now we've got a corporate culture
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  and a private culture of corruption,
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  and we're probably done.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  You understand? We're done.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  We're going to get you into the business
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  and cowardly to the little punks and uniforms
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  and corrupt government, and it's over!
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  We're a third world cesspit.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  The New World Order basically got the job done.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  We have a small chance of turning it around.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  You understand that?
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Alex, would you...
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  Are you going to like paying more debt or...
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  Hey, hold on. Are you going to like having to pay cops off?
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  More debt has already started all over Texas.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  You like the fact in like 12 different South Texas towns,
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  they fly the Mexican flag,
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  and they watch aloud in the courthouses?
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  See, I know what's really going on.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  My wife speaks Spanish, brother.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  I don't care about the people with brown skin.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Being here.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  I care about the fact they've been brainwashed.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Okay?
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  I try to warn them to stop letting the New World Order euthanize them.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  But see, that doesn't feel good like the tribalism.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  I don't think you understand, my friend.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  You understand now?
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  I mean, do you know about the plan of San Diego?
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  I found out that Mexico has a plan to come in here
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  and kill all whites?
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  I'm sorry, I learned about it.
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  on your back for anyone to read?
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  Of course not.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  and debit cards in circulation in your wallet,
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  that's exactly what you're doing.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  I'm Wal Augustino.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  It's founder of Identity Stronghold,
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  and we think this is information you need to know.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  that look physically just like the old card.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  that makes radio communication with the card possible
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  without you ever removing the card.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  to get your information.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents,
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  and that's why we manufacture the SecureSleeve.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  The SecureSleeve is a patent pending card sleeve
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  that contains a radio frequency barrier,
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  To get more information and purchase the SecureSleeve
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  online at idstronghold.com,
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  that's idstronghold.com,
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:01.000]  or call us at 800-610-2770.
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  On September 11th, 2001,
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  I went to Grounds here and we knew what to do,
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  or at least we thought we did.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  to tell their story.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  And EPA director on the 18th made a statement
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  as brave souls throughout the world
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  take action against their global masters.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  He had his hand over the radio
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  while he was getting the countdown.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one,
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  and aggressively spread it worldwide,

[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  You invest, you buy insurance, you wear your seatbelt,
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  you do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  But why? Just in case?
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself,
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  am I ready? Preparation starts at survivalgearsource.com.

[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  Tex Mars is sitting right across from me
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  and coming up to T-minus five minutes
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  when we start the third hour.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  He'll be with us for a full hour.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  He'll be live at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Streaming out with video of Tex and my shelf
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  and some of the documents and articles he has
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  and some of your phone calls beginning to the economy.
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  The big picture regardless of John McCain
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  or Barack Obama wins.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  I think Obama is probably the more dangerous
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  because he can get more popular support
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  and sell people that he's different.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  He's on the surface because of skin color.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  I'm going to let Anna Rebecca at least in the calls right now.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  Anna and Idaho, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  Hi, did you say Anna?
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Is it Anna or Anna?
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  It's Anna.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  Okay, Anna, go ahead.
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  First of all, I wanted to say thank you. I'm a huge fan.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  I am a mother. You're welcome.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  I'm a mother and a wife of 14 years
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  and I have to get your radio show on info wars.com.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  And so I work during the day, so it's nice sometimes
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  if I can come home and just either push listen now
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  and I just wanted to say thank you.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Well, thank you. You can always get the free podcast too.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  Well, thank you.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  My question for you is that I need you
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  to kind of dumb down the gold and silver thing
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  because I don't understand what the purchasing power would be.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Okay, well, they can fully devalue a paper currency.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  And gold according to economists should be at $2,500 to $3,000
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  depending on 1980 inflation,
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  just governments admitted inflation,
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  which is really much lower than what it really is.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  And so the point is they decided to fully devalue the dollar
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  in the next few years,
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  but they're going to devalue all currencies they've now announced
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  basically at the same time to try to create the illusion
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  on the currency markets that the dollar isn't really falling.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  And so with gold, they can always in the paper markets
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  lower its price, but all the trends show
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  it should be radically increasing in the future.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  And it already has increased from about $280,
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  five, six years ago to right around $800 to $1,000
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  at gyrates back and forth between there.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  And so then if a new currency comes in
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  or something else happens, you can still cash in gold and silver
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  for whatever the new monetary unit is.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  Oh, I understand.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  I thought I purchased gold.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  Here I'd have these gold pieces and I'm thinking,
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  how am I going to pay for my groceries with this gold?
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  Well, you'll take those into a coin dealer or precious metal shop
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  and then you'll cash that in.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  So see, let's say you kept money in a shoebox, $1,000.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  Well, in two years, it'll be worth about half of what it is now
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  conservatively with purchasing power.
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  But if you kept gold in a shoebox, let's just say gold
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  stayed at the same price, but with inflation went up
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  but the same value, you would be able to go in and cash it in
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  for $2,000 in cash.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  So do you see what I'm saying?
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  Gold has intrinsic real value like anything else precious.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  I mean, you could collect art, the elite collect art,
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  famous art pieces because it intrinsically goes up in value
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  and they know where to cash it in later.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  But I don't recommend art as a storage of wealth for the average person
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  because it takes a lot of research to do that properly.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  But I mean, there's land.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  But see, they put a property tax on land which they can jack up
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  and then always take from you as well.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  So there's nothing like having some gold and silver or platinum
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  which is raw, which has intrinsic value since civilization
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  formed in the Tiger Shoe Freddy 6,000 years ago.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  Well, thank you for that.
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  You bet.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  But there's a lot of other things you can do.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  I mean, the best thing is having a rural piece of property
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  you can go to if you need to be having friends and family
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  you can trust, neighbors you can trust.
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  That's the most important thing.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  But I meant to get to Rebecca and we will with Text Mars later.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  I'll get to everybody that's holding, but we're going to come back
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  with Text Mars live at PrisonPlanet.tv
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  and on the info or screen, and of course in the M&M dial
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  we'll be doing some behind the scenes talking as well.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  bin Laden.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  This is his MO.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  warnings and war games, the shadow government,
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  and much, much more.
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVDs.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  You want answers?
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:57.000]  We're being told that as soon as John McCain or Barack Obama
[1:59:57.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  are elected and inaugurated coming up in late January
[2:00:01.000 --> 2:00:05.000]  when Al Qaeda is going to test America and Europe with a terror attack
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  or the government's going to state more terror attacks,
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  the shadow government, to give an excuse to the system to expand more wars,
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  take more liberties and freedoms.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  We'll be talking about that, the economy with Texmars and a lot more.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  And Texas also done some research.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  This is coming up at the end of the hour.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  On the Grand Puba, the guy that says that basically anybody
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  and everybody in the patriot movement except him is an agent of the Vatican.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  Now, that's pretty funny because you're, of course, a Protestant pastor.
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  My family helped found Texas.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:43.000]  The Heirs family raised Colonel Travis's son.
[2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  They brought in Bibles into Galveston and literally ran from the Jesuits
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  who were trying to kill them up to Nacodotius and then into Central Texas after that.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  So that's really funny as well.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  But we're not going to name any names today.
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  It's just what's been discovered is very interesting.
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  And, of course, it was obvious from the beginning,
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  but it's become even more obvious.
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:09.000]  So it's very important to understand that people want to undermine movements
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  and want to claim to people that are effectively exposing the New World Order
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  that we're all the agents.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  And notice, we are never out doing that.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  And then nine times out of ten, we find out those saying this about us, they are the agents.
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  No one's saying that the Vatican isn't very corrupt and part of the New World Order.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  Texas has written books on that and even been criticized by Catholic publications for that.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  It's just that this is a great wedge issue to try to somehow energize evangelical Christians
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  into attacking Christian leaders like Texmars and others.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  So it's just more infighting, more divide and conquer.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  It's been too much time on that, maybe five, ten minutes,
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  but it should very serious discovery that has been made.
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  But I don't want this individual's name uttered on my show because before I even knew who he was,
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:59.000]  he called me, oh no, emailed me a bunch like four or five years ago.
[2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  And the first email I saw was, how dare you?
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  You've refused my interviews.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  You're clearly a Vatican agent.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  If you don't interview me within one week, I will expose you.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  And I was like, well, I'm not going to do that.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  Though I would like you to expose the place of the Vatican in the whole New World Order with us today.
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  We're not bashing Catholics, folks.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  This thing has taken over everything.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  But I think it's important to also show that.
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  But then I learned this individual says I'm a white supremacist.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  No, it's not about me.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  He says he's a white supremacist.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  He says that blacks should be put in their own country.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  He says that Catholic priests do black magic rituals in aircraft
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  and fire power beams down that that's what nuclear bombs are.
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  And he's clearly trying to discredit the whole movement.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  I mean, only a two-year-old would not see this, but I've ignored it.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  And then the people that are his followers who are well-meaning idiots,
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  I go, but do Catholic priests do black magic?
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  I mean, is the earth on a string?
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  He says the earth is on a string in the center of the universe
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  and that they drop nukes on lay lines with Masonic power beams.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  I mean, you can't make this up, so that's coming up.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  But instead of myself babbling text, we're going to skip this break for the internet audience.
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  I'll be back for everybody else.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  Let's get into the economy first and the election and spend the lion's share of that.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  I don't like policing people.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  But this really is interesting when they try to police us.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  And they're clearly not crackpots. They're clearly there to discredit everybody.
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  Oh yeah, well, talking about the individual.
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  And by the way, there are a number of individuals seeking to discredit everything from the 9-11 truth movement
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  to really what we are, which is the overall truth movement,
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  exposing the global conspiracy of the elite.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  And of course, you know, from the CIA, the Israeli Mossad have a tremendous amount of money
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  and they've put into these people.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  There are many disinformation agents out there.
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  But you have to watch carefully what they're doing.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  Usually they go to the ridiculous, you know, and this is what they do to discredit the movement
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  because later you'll see them begin to be quoted.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  For example, the individual you're talking about went over to Israel and was on Israel National Radio.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  So he was chosen, you see.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  And it turns out, and by the way, he blast anybody, this person that you're talking about,
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  who supposedly has been exposing the Vatican Jesuits,
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  he will blast anyone who exposes Zionism.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  I'm always wondered about that.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  You know, it's one thing to expose the Catholic Church and the Vatican,
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  but why does he defend the Zionists so, so...
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Hold on, Tex, we just went to break.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  John, I'm going to skip this break so Tex can continue, as I was saying.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  Okay, please continue, Tex.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  This individual not only has supposedly written a book,
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  although it's a very mysterious publisher that never published a book before or after,
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  and he claims he's not related to this publisher.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  But he wrote this book, and it is going to be the end-all book to expose the Jesuits.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  Now, I've been busy exposing the Jesuits myself for about 20 years,
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  and I'm more than willing to welcome anyone that does this, but I got his book,
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  and it was absolutely ridiculous.
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  I mean, the Jesuits have done everything from killing JFK,
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  World War I, World War II, World War III.
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  I mean, it's almost incredible, but the big thing about this individual,
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  he goes from the Jesuits to start attacking anyone who says that 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  Oh, they're Vatican Jesuit priests in hiding.
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  Then he goes against, let's say, people like Constance Cumbie.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Now, Cumbie wrote a book long time ago exposing the New Age occult movement.
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  He says Cumbie is a Vatican Jesuit.
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  She's a Romish vixen, you know, and which sort of made me laugh a little bit,
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  Romish vixen.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  I think he took a picture of Connie about 40 years ago, you know,
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  and he still thinks she looks like that.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  That shows the depth of his research.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  But now this man is knocking the 9-11 truth movement,
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  and if you expose Zionism, he is really after you.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  Boy, you're the one.
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  You must be secretly a Vatican Jesuit, or you wouldn't be against Zionism.
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  So this is his game, and I've noticed as he has attacked you,
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  as he has attacked Alfred Weber, the guy that wants to have the 9-11 Tribunal to try Bush and Cheney.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  He's attacked him, called him a Vatican Jesuit, you know, covert agent.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  He's attacked me, of course.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  Even though I probably have more videos, more CDs in my ministry,
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  you can go there and just type in the word, Catholic or Vatican.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  I've probably done, you know, a dozen videos exposing the Vatican,
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  but now I'm a Vatican agent, and it's very interesting, too, though.
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  Well, that's because all evil can only flow from the Vatican.
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  Well, yeah, that's his theory.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  But, of course, the Vatican does have the evil, and that's what I've been exposing,
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  along with, by the way, the tele-evangelists and the others,
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  who are also paid by the Illuminati elite, and I've done that, too.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  So I've sort of looked at the whole range of faults.
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Yeah, they've taken it all over, basically.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  All the big institutions, but they don't want that.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  But, I mean, the craziest thing is saying that they do black magic rituals to make nuclear explosions.
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  I mean, I...
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  Well, what he does in his book, and the radio programs,
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  and he's been invited, unfortunately, on to a number of Patriot radio programs.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  And they're looking for the truth, so this man seems to have some truth, you see.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  But then, after he's gained a little notoriety, then he starts attacking...
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  Oh, everyone who goes against...
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  Hold on, hold on. We're going back to full audience. We're going back to full audience. Here we go.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  Jones show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  Now, again, folks, we're not even in fighting here.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  That means fighting people who are in the Patriot movement or the Awakening movement.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  And I wanted to get into this later, but Texas is just getting into it now,
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  so we can also get into the economy and your take on the election.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  But there are people out there, and the kingpin of this
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  literally says that nuclear weapons...
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  And I challenge people to counter me on this, they won't.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  Because he's got quite a following.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  They do black magic rituals in Foo Fighter flying saucers.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  I'm not joking.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  And that they drop these things on lay lines,
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  and they can only drop nukes on lay lines,
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  because that's where their black magic power works.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  Now, he also says the earth is on some type of meridian,
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  tropic of cancer, I don't know what that means,
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  and it's on a string, and the earth goes up and down on a string,
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  and the universe orbits it.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  And I mean, that's all...
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  He can't believe that.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  I mean, that's meant to discredit what he's saying.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  And then blacks need to all be sent to their own country.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  He says, I'm a white supremacist.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  And then he goes and says,
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  and we're Nazi Vatican agents who are working for the Nazis.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  And then again, we're neither one of us are Catholic.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  I mean, you actually married my wife,
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  and I know you're a Protestant.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  You're also a retired Air Force officer
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  and a space aeronautics professor.
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  And I just ignore this stuff.
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  But then I did start noticing that like the Israeli government
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  and people have this guy on,
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  and then you discovered that he's actually
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  in the pay of some of the Israeli folks,
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  and it kind of leads a double life.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  And that's really what I found,
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  because I've tried to stay out of the whole Zionist thing.
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  I've had guests unlike yourself to cover it.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  I'm against what Israel does when they murder innocent people.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  You know, I'm against, you know, some of the views there.
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  I'm against the infiltration of our government,
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  the spying, all that stuff.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  And we've made fabled enemies about it.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  But just because I'm trying to cover the general
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  New World Order stuff and not getting all the fighting,
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  you know, I've been a little light on it.
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  And I've tried to be more hardcore on it.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  But even before I got more serious on the issue,
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  I was attacked.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  I mean, if you say the Israel attack to U.S.S. Liberty,
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  which is now declassified and admitted,
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  that is a lie.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  You are working for the Pope.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  And I mean, it doesn't matter if it's now admitted,
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  mainstream news.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  So I don't want to spend all day on this text,
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  because, you know, you're a giant in this 20 years fighting
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  the New World Order.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  I've been doing it for 13 years.
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  And I know you've made some amazing discoveries.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Other have as well about this individual.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  But, you know, that's what I told people privately about it.
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  I just said, look, that's some kind of way to get to sick
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Protestants who've been conditioned, you know, through the churches
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  to worship Israel instead of Christ.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  That's a new religion.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  Absolutely.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  And Pastor Hage, now saying Jesus isn't even the Messiah.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  And people say, yes, he's not.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  You know, Israel, the real Messiah is about to come to Israel.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  The Bible says the fake Messiah is going to come to Israel.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  But the point is, this is classic stuff.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  And so I've just pulled back from it.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  And I keep expecting people to go, look,
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:33.000]  he says flying saucers drop nukes.
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  But they don't.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  Well, they fastened on the Vatican Jesuits.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:39.000]  And this is a very interesting subject.
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  You know, 20 years ago, I exposed the Vatican through the order of the Jesuit
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  infiltration of Washington, D.C.
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  And we can go all the way back to the founding of the United States
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  and the Jesuits had a hand.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  So, you know, it's okay to expose all these various secret societies,
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  the Knights of Malta, the Jesuits of the Vatican and everything.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  And I've been chief in doing that.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  And I welcome anyone else.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  There are many secret societies.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  As you know, from Freemasons.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  But you judge a tree by its fruits.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  You have been chief exposing that.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  And then someone comes out and says, you're an agent.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  Well, yeah, but you have to ask yourself, why do they do that?
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  Why did this individual, why did he say Jeff Rents of Rents.com is a Vatican agent?
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  Why does he say Constance Cumbie, who has exposed occultism,
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  why is she suddenly a Vatican co-agitor of the Jesuits?
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  Why is Alfred Weber from Canada, who has been exposing Dick Cheney and Bush
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  in the 9-11 movement, why is he suddenly a Vatican Jesuit?
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  Why is Pastor Butch Paul, a wonderful pastor of Aptus,
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  yeah, you know, who's been involved exposing the New World Order.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  The guy was indicted even because he had the temerity to say, you know,
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  people write this judge and tell him what he did, ABC was wrong.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  And then they come down and get this guy as a very brave patriot.
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:15.000]  Now, listen, listen, I'm going to tell you, I've exposed many people in my time.
[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  But I appreciate the patriot movement, the people who listen to this program, Alex Jones.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  I appreciate what you've done.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  And I've known you from the very, very beginning.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  I know your father, a great Christian man.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  Now, all this is nonsense.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  So I asked myself, who is this man?
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  And I've done some investigation.
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  But there is a website out there called ZionistChampions.com.
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  ZionistChampions.com.
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  And it has everything on this guy in his own words.
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  Here's what he, this man who says, all I'm doing is exposing Alex Jones
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  and Tex Morris and Alfred Weber and Constance Cumbie and Jeff Rentson, butch Paul.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  He's got a long list.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  Almost all the leaders of the 9-11 Truth Movement seem to be Vatican agents,
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  which is, of course, ridiculous.
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  But I said, and also he really seems to despise anyone who even mentions
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  the Israeli Mossad or the Zionist connection.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  Why is he so favorable and ardent toward the Zionist movement?
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  Turns out that he's a Israeli diamond merchant, okay?
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  Has his own website in which he brags that he's looking for the very wealthy
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  who want the finest diamonds and gems cut by Israeli diamond cutters and Tel Aviv.
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  Then it turns out he's been to Israel back and forth,
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  meeting with various unnamed people in Israel.
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  And as it turns out, the guy was even invited on the Tamara Yonah talk show
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  that interviews all the movers and shakers in Israel.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  This is Israel National Radio.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  I mean, this is run by the Zionist.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  And they invited this guy on.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  What was the subject of his message?
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  Well, he's blasting the Catholic Jesuits.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  They're the evil people of this world.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  They want to destroy Israel, et cetera.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  They want to take over Jerusalem.
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:12.000]  And of course, he doesn't believe in the 9-11 Truth Movement, these conspiracy theorists.
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  They're dangerous, too.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  And by the way, the guy has gotten so popular.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  He was invited to the University of Oklahoma, the Hasidic Jewish group.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  They invited him there also to talk to them.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  So the guy's got a great following.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  And of course, he's an Israeli diamond trader.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  Now, here's another thing this day.
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  I didn't talk about that on air, though.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  No, he didn't let anybody know.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  He says, you are anti-Semite.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  But he doesn't tell anybody that he's an Israeli diamond merchant who brags about it on his own website.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  Now, here's another dangerous thing.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Some of these people try to get you to commit crimes.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Go bomb something.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  Go do this.
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  Go do that.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  Kill these people.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  Watch out for those folks.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  Watch out.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  Here's one of the things he's done.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  He's got three different websites, by the way, this particular agent.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:06.000]  On one of them, he brags and says, for 25 years, I have not filed out, filled out my IRS tax forms.
[2:15:06.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  I do not pay taxes.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  Well, they've nailed you to the wall, gone after me, everybody, but not him.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  He says, I have never asked for a social security number, and I never will.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  Okay, now he's sort of inviting everybody.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Do like I do, you see.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  Don't pay taxes.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  Don't even fill out your...
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  And you notice when I get on there, I tell folks, be careful.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  You know, it's criminal.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  It's illegal.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  But you know...
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  Taxes, let's face it.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  Taxes are wasted.
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  It makes us angry and all that stuff.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  But you've got to be very careful, because the IRS is just waiting.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  The point is, I tell people, it is fraudulent.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  It is a scam, but you make your own decisions.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  Yeah, so he approaches it, I'm a Christian like you.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  I haven't paid taxes in 25 years.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  You don't need to pay taxes.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  I think he's inviting these people in.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  He gets a mailing list of these people.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  Well, I've noticed that whatever crowd it is...
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  He may be proud of this.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  Over to the IRS.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  You know, I mean, he'll come up and say, I'm a white nationalist.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  I'm a white supremacist.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  And then to another crowd, he says, I'm this, I'm that.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:01.000]  Exactly.
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  So it's different for every crowd.
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  Yeah, he flies to Israel, goes on Israel National Radio, and blasts Christians.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  Okay?
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  And that pleases the Jews, the Zionists over there.
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  But he comes back to America and says, I'm a white supremacist.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  He actually said that.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  He says, I'm a racist, but I'm a good racist.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  Okay?
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  And then he says, the black people are culturally, intellectually, and spiritually inferior.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  We shouldn't even be allowed to live in the white nation.
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  We should force them over and have, they can have their own country, push them out.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  Now, think about this.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  Here's a guy who's an Israeli diamond trader.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  Who's claiming to be a white, he says, I'm a white supremacist.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  I'm a racist, but a good racist.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  Well, that's like the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  I just want to put them in the wrong thing.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  That's like Southern Poverty Law Center, and it came out in government documents.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  It's mainstream news now.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  It's been in a whole bunch of newspapers.
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  The first one that broke it was Jesse trying to do the lawyer in the Salt Lake City Tribune
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  a couple years ago that it turned out the Southern Poverty Law Center was running Elohim City.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  Yeah.
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  What they do is they found many of these white supremacist groups, the Aryan Nations and
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  all the others.
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  And then it turns out that they want them to go out and be crazy, to dress up like Hitler
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  and wear little funny little mustaches and go sing a hyal.
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  So that they can say, see, everyone who wants to expose 911 is just like that.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  They're all a bunch of Hitler's.
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  They're Alex Jones.
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  They're Vatican agents.
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  They're Jesuits.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  They're anti-Semites.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  But see, that's why one man has all these things going at once.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  But see, Tex, that's why I try to talk about North American Union, the Federal Reserve being
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  private.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:39.000]  I don't like coming on here and having to talk about how the illegal aliens have been brainwashed
[2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  to hate America and want LaRica on Quista.
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  I know they're good people, so I try to stop the Planned Parenthood killing them.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  I don't like coming on here and bashing Catholics because the Pope's calling for a new world
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  order, but I have to talk about it, but I'm not trying to make it a hate thing.
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  And I don't like, and I know a lot of Jews in Israel hate what's happening and it's
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  diverse over there.
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  But I know the Zionists are part of the new world order and pushing it, so I have you
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  want to talk about it.
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  And then I get the crowd that thinks Israel is the center of all evil.
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  Look, it's mad that I don't go far enough.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  The point is, is that I'm just trying to get everybody to work together against tyranny.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  And there are these people who were just completely out of control.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  Yes.
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  Well, here's the whole thing.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  They won't.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  What you want is an America.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  You want to enforce immigration laws and you know that they're going to use these Mexican
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:30.000]  illegal aliens and the ones from Central America against America.
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  Okay.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  And this is what we despise and what we fight against, but we don't oppose the individuals
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  at all.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  You know, we're Christians.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:41.440]  I believe whosoever will may come.
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:46.500]  That means anyone of any race, but listen, they want a black, white race war.
[2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:52.600]  They want the Mexicans to try this Reconquista and to kill white people and to set up this
[2:18:52.600 --> 2:18:55.500]  Azzlan empire of the south.
[2:18:55.500 --> 2:18:56.500]  And they talk about it.
[2:18:56.500 --> 2:18:58.000]  I'm supposed to act like it doesn't exist.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  Yeah.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  Yeah, but you've got to.
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:03.300]  You've got to expose this because I'll tell you, many Mexicans, many black people and
[2:19:03.300 --> 2:19:05.880]  white people are going to be victim.
[2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:11.560]  They want us to fight amongst ourselves while the Illuminati elite grab everything.
[2:19:11.560 --> 2:19:17.040]  And they control all the major groups and their agents always want to make it only one
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:19.600]  group so we don't see the entire attack power.
[2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:20.600]  Oh, listen, listen.
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:21.600]  Stay there.
[2:19:21.600 --> 2:19:22.600]  We got a break.
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:23.600]  Yeah.
[2:19:23.600 --> 2:19:24.600]  We're going to skip this one too for the Internet audience.
[2:19:24.600 --> 2:19:27.600]  We'll be back for everybody else in four minutes with Tex Mars in FullWars.com is the
[2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:28.600]  website.
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:29.600]  We'll give you his websites as well.
[2:19:29.600 --> 2:19:33.600]  And Tex, I do want to get into the election, which he originally did and what's happening
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:34.600]  with the economy.
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:37.640]  And then in this wicked devil right here.
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:38.640]  King Henry Paulson.
[2:19:38.640 --> 2:19:39.640]  Yeah.
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:40.640]  I'll just mess you up here now.
[2:19:40.640 --> 2:19:44.680]  Because I want you to be able to run through all this, but I'm sorry for messing that
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:45.680]  up.
[2:19:45.680 --> 2:19:48.320]  But I mean, since we got into this early, go ahead and finish up with it.
[2:19:48.320 --> 2:19:51.520]  Well, I think we have to be very careful.
[2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:54.280]  We oppose illegal aliens coming to America.
[2:19:54.280 --> 2:19:57.160]  We oppose 40 or 50 million.
[2:19:57.160 --> 2:20:00.480]  And that's really what it is, even though they say it's only 12 million.
[2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:02.640]  They kept that figure for years and years.
[2:20:02.640 --> 2:20:06.200]  But Bear Stearns, which may be one of the reasons they went out of business, actually
[2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:12.320]  did a report two years ago in which they said there as many as 35 million needles in America.
[2:20:12.320 --> 2:20:15.800]  The banking and brokerage numbers were 35 million three years ago.
[2:20:15.800 --> 2:20:19.040]  So we want to keep America for Americans.
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:20.840]  There's nothing wrong with being America first.
[2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:21.840]  And by the way, if you live in Mexico...
[2:20:21.840 --> 2:20:25.680]  It's going to bankrupt all of the hospitals, all the city services.
[2:20:25.680 --> 2:20:26.680]  It's already happened.
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:27.680]  Absolutely.
[2:20:27.680 --> 2:20:30.800]  But see, if we made the revolution stay down there, they'd take their country back.
[2:20:30.800 --> 2:20:32.880]  We're being used as a steam valve that hurts them.
[2:20:32.880 --> 2:20:33.880]  It hurts us.
[2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:36.080]  Well, I hope we won't go in too much of this individual.
[2:20:36.080 --> 2:20:39.560]  See, it's very only one of many disinformation agents.
[2:20:39.560 --> 2:20:41.240]  No, but one of the most effective.
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:45.720]  But I mean, going back to what you just said about the illegal aliens, it hurts my heart
[2:20:45.720 --> 2:20:46.720]  because it's the same thing.
[2:20:46.720 --> 2:20:49.640]  I don't like going on air and talking about how the Vatican's calling for world government
[2:20:49.640 --> 2:20:52.680]  and new world order because I know unsophisticated people are her Catholics.
[2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:53.760]  I think I'm bashing them.
[2:20:53.760 --> 2:20:57.840]  I don't like coming on air and saying Pat Robertson said China's having to have abortion.
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:20:59.600]  I lost a couple of radio affiliates.
[2:20:59.600 --> 2:21:04.520]  He said it on CNN, and I said it's wrong for Pat Robertson to say abortion's good in China,
[2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:05.520]  which he did.
[2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:08.920]  And those affiliates said, hey, we don't like you talking about Pat Robertson, apologize
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:10.080]  you're off the air.
[2:21:10.080 --> 2:21:11.080]  That was in Florida.
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:13.760]  And I said, I'm sorry, I can't be for abortion.
[2:21:13.760 --> 2:21:17.880]  So you know, the point is I have to bash the Protestant leaders who are controlled.
[2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:19.920]  I have to bash the Catholic leaders who are controlled.
[2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:22.040]  I have to bash the Jewish leaders who are controlled.
[2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:26.000]  I mean, when I bash the British government is one of the top levels of this.
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:27.560]  I'm not bashing the British people.
[2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:28.560]  My name's Jones.
[2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:29.560]  Your name's Mars.
[2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:30.560]  You're Scottish.
[2:21:30.560 --> 2:21:32.600]  I mean, the point is, that's the key.
[2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:37.160]  They control through the round table grips, the governments and the major religions, and
[2:21:37.160 --> 2:21:38.760]  then they control it through that.
[2:21:38.760 --> 2:21:40.200]  You're giving them wide spectrum.
[2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:41.200]  The kingdom of the cults.
[2:21:41.200 --> 2:21:45.600]  You're showing them how it's happening, and that's what the agents never want that.
[2:21:45.600 --> 2:21:49.080]  They want to make it, and that isn't just on the Catholic side.
[2:21:49.080 --> 2:21:54.320]  They want to make it just about Zionist or just about, you know, and it's bigger than
[2:21:54.320 --> 2:21:55.320]  that.
[2:21:55.320 --> 2:21:59.440]  Alex, let's just look at the Council on Foreign Relations, which I believe is all
[2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:04.200]  almost an aristocracy of the elite in the political and economic worlds.
[2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:09.200]  All the top CEOs, all the banking investment of people, members of the Council on Foreign
[2:22:09.200 --> 2:22:10.200]  Relations.
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:15.360]  Now, the CFR itself, and this was in their Foreign Affairs Journal that comes out.
[2:22:15.360 --> 2:22:19.640]  They have established a religious round table.
[2:22:19.640 --> 2:22:23.560]  You have to understand this is political, economic and spiritual.
[2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:28.240]  Now guess who the head, the chairman of the religious round table is?
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:30.400]  One other than Henry Kissinger.
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:37.360]  Now, at the same time, Pope Benedict, believe it or not, has appointed Henry Kissinger as
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:38.360]  his advisor.
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:39.840]  As his political advisor.
[2:22:39.840 --> 2:22:43.120]  And Tony Blair has become Catholic, so he can be the future head of Europe, and that
[2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:44.120]  was admitted.
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:47.200]  And we said, if he's going to be the new EU chief in the future, he'll have to become
[2:22:47.200 --> 2:22:53.120]  Catholic, and he did that because they admit the EU is a, quote, Vatican political body.
[2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:54.840]  So it's definitely at the heart of it.
[2:22:54.840 --> 2:22:56.560]  You write books saying that.
[2:22:56.560 --> 2:22:57.560]  Absolutely.
[2:22:57.560 --> 2:22:59.200]  You're a wicked devil.
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:00.200]  Yeah.
[2:23:00.200 --> 2:23:03.880]  But wait, Henry Kissinger doesn't stop with a Vatican.
[2:23:03.880 --> 2:23:04.880]  That's not enough.
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:09.560]  I mean, we have several hundred million Protestants in this world, I should say ex-Protestants.
[2:23:09.560 --> 2:23:10.920]  They don't even say they're Protestants.
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:14.600]  Now they're Evangelicals, Christian Evangelicals.
[2:23:14.600 --> 2:23:19.200]  So the religious round table of the CFR has to reach out to them too, and bring them within
[2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:20.200]  its fold.
[2:23:20.200 --> 2:23:21.200]  Guess what?
[2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:26.680]  Rick Warren, who has been called America's pastor, is now a member of the Council on Foreign
[2:23:26.680 --> 2:23:32.480]  Relations and is a member of Henry Kissinger's religious round table.
[2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:34.480]  So they don't care if you're a Protestant, even if you're a Catholic.
[2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:35.480]  Hold on.
[2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:36.480]  We're going back live to the full audience.
[2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:37.480]  Full audience.
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:38.480]  Here we go.
[2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:46.640]  Tex, they've got several subgroups to control, Christian Republican groups.
[2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:48.600]  One of them is the Something Policy Center.
[2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:52.160]  You were just talking about the Nexus Points with Henry Kissinger, both the Catholic group,
[2:23:52.160 --> 2:23:55.840]  the religious round table group, over the Protestant group, how he's over all these
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:23:58.920]  groups together up at the top.
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:01.800]  What's the name of that big group that has a lot of the Christian conservative leaders
[2:24:01.800 --> 2:24:03.080]  they meet in secret every year?
[2:24:03.080 --> 2:24:05.360]  Well, there's a Council on National Policy.
[2:24:05.360 --> 2:24:06.360]  Yeah.
[2:24:06.360 --> 2:24:07.360]  Yeah.
[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:08.360]  Absolutely.
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:12.440]  And then that is weighted mostly to the Catholic side.
[2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:16.960]  You know, the head of Coors Brewing and all that, the beer company.
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:18.800]  All of those people are part of that group.
[2:24:18.800 --> 2:24:21.880]  James Dobson is also part of that.
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:27.240]  The old 700 club, you know, its leaders, Farnier and others, were all Catholic.
[2:24:27.240 --> 2:24:30.120]  So a lot of those people are part of that group.
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:34.560]  But what I was talking about now was the Council on Foreign Relations, the CFR, that
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:35.760]  it has a religious round table.
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:36.760]  Yeah.
[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:39.640]  People don't think of it as a spiritual organization.
[2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:45.120]  Now you have to understand, they take everybody into their fold who's part of this global
[2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:47.400]  and anti-American conspiracy.
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:50.360]  They have taken Lulac, okay, the Latin group.
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:57.760]  They have taken Maldef, okay, all of these anti-American pro-illegal immigration movements.
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:01.000]  They are now members of the CFR, but they've gone beyond that.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:06.680]  They have set up and they had an actual, a big issue, special edition of Foreign Affairs,
[2:25:06.680 --> 2:25:08.920]  their journal, the CFR.
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:13.760]  And they said, we have established a religious round table.
[2:25:13.760 --> 2:25:18.200]  And listen to who are members of it, Catholic Cardinals, but wait.
[2:25:18.200 --> 2:25:23.960]  So Rick Warren, okay, of Saddleback Community Church, who is supposedly a Christian evangelical.
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:27.000]  You know, the guy that wrote the Purpose Driven Church, that was number one on the New York
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:28.480]  Times best seller list.
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:35.320]  They even said in the Foreign Affairs Journal that John Hagee and the pro-Israel movement
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:37.160]  needs to be brought into our fold.
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:39.760]  We need to bring all of these people into, you see.
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:43.920]  So this is not a Catholic Protestant situation.
[2:25:43.920 --> 2:25:51.240]  They simply want to corrupt, bankrupt the morality of all the Christian establishment.
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:52.240]  That's what they've done.
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:53.240]  I want people to understand.
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:56.580]  There is a Christian church, but it's not the televangelist.
[2:25:56.580 --> 2:25:58.080]  It's not the Vatican.
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:00.280]  And I call it the mom and pop church.
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:06.720]  I mean, many of them have to meet in their homes now because the entire Christian establishment
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:08.400]  has been exposed as corrupt.
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:09.920]  This goes back a long time.
[2:26:09.920 --> 2:26:14.800]  Meanwhile, we have the movie W making it all the evil George Bush did was because he was
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:16.480]  a Christian.
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:17.760]  He's born again.
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:18.760]  Can you speak to that?
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:23.000]  I mean, all the gay prostitutes, skull and bones, Bohemian Grove, all the mean things
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:24.120]  Bush does.
[2:26:24.120 --> 2:26:26.160]  And then they act like he's this loving idiot, Savant.
[2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:29.400]  He just did it all because evil Christians got control of him.
[2:26:29.400 --> 2:26:34.400]  Well, let's look at the Illuminati elite standpoint in this election and you'll see what's going
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:35.400]  on.
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:40.560]  You say McCain and Palin have the Christian evangelicals and all of the traditionals.
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:42.520]  And you say, oh, thank God for them.
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:43.720]  Thank God for Sarah Palin.
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:44.720]  But hold on.
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:50.760]  Now, on the other side, you've got the liberal groups, maybe even all the way over to the
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:57.160]  Islamic secret agents of Obama and Biden and of course, Biden is Catholic.
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:00.240]  So there you have the Catholic, Muslim factions.
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:05.240]  So they seem to be putting these two great forces at odds with each other.
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:06.240]  But watch out.
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:09.160]  Let me tell your audience about something, okay?
[2:27:09.160 --> 2:27:14.360]  First of all, you have to understand that Sarah Palin was chosen by Zionist billionaires
[2:27:14.360 --> 2:27:18.160]  in Israel before McCain even knew her name.
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:22.680]  In fact, I can show you, we were talking about the Tamar Yonah show, one of the most popular
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:26.680]  talk shows on Israel National Radio.
[2:27:26.680 --> 2:27:27.680]  Guess what?
[2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:33.240]  They had a two-hour special on Sarah Palin right after she was made governor of Alaska.
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:39.800]  They said, we have a Zionist pro-Israel person as governor and they forecast a great future
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:40.800]  for her.
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:45.760]  Now, there are 50 states in America, probably 49 of the governors are pro-Israel, right?
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:48.720]  Because it pays to me because of the powerful Israeli lobby.
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:54.240]  Why did Israel National Radio, the Tamar Yonah show that interviews all the movers and shakers?
[2:27:54.240 --> 2:27:59.960]  Why do they have a two-hour special bringing Sarah Palin in?
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:05.280]  Sarah Palin herself said, I only have one flag in my office as governor of the state
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:08.920]  of Alaska, the flag of the nation of Israel.
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:15.760]  Why did she, when she had the debate with Palin say, I love Israel, Joe Biden?
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:18.000]  And I'm glad to know that you support Israel.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:24.040]  Why when Charlie Gibson asked Sarah Palin, what will you and McCain in Washington, DC
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:30.920]  do if Israel starts basically, he didn't say the word, but World War III by invading Iran?
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:34.040]  She says, we would not second guess our ally Israel.
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:37.080]  In other words, it's okay with us, whatever they do.
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:43.200]  Although it will bring America into World War III, it will probably mean gasoline at
[2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:45.680]  $25 a gallon.
[2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:48.600]  And of course, the rich of the world would love that.
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:50.000]  They're going to buy those oil futures.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:53.040]  They drove it up one time to $147 a barrel.
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:57.120]  Now they love to see it at $300, $400, $500 a gallon.
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:00.320]  It'll mean 20 or 30 million Americans out of work.
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:01.320]  What do they care?
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:06.760]  We're peons anyway, third world nation, and they will profit from our poverty.
[2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:10.560]  Wow, Tex Mars is fired up today.
[2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:12.560]  I tell you, stay there.
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:13.720]  We're going to take this break.
[2:29:13.720 --> 2:29:16.760]  We'll be back in three short minutes with Tex Mars.
[2:29:16.760 --> 2:29:19.880]  I want to talk some about your new book as well.
[2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:21.160]  We're on the march.
[2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:23.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:29.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:29.920 --> 2:29:31.720]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:36.360]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:38.760]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:43.560]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:47.240]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:51.760]  I wonder how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:52.760]  across America.
[2:29:52.760 --> 2:29:56.720]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:29:56.720 --> 2:30:00.440]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:30:00.440 --> 2:30:01.440]  healthier I feel.
[2:30:01.440 --> 2:30:04.120]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:30:04.120 --> 2:30:09.320]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:11.840]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:31.240]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:30:31.240 --> 2:30:34.240]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:36.520]  9-11 was an inside job.
[2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:37.680]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:39.240]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:30:39.240 --> 2:30:42.240]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[2:30:42.240 --> 2:30:46.240]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.?
[2:30:46.240 --> 2:30:53.680]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[2:30:53.680 --> 2:30:55.720]  to grow at our own door.
[2:30:55.720 --> 2:31:01.600]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:04.200]  An inside job?
[2:31:04.200 --> 2:31:05.200]  How dare you?
[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:11.760]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:11.760 --> 2:31:14.360]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:31:14.360 --> 2:31:18.840]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[2:31:18.840 --> 2:31:19.840]  anniversary of 9-11.
[2:31:19.840 --> 2:31:20.840]  Truth rising.

[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:33.360]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?

[2:33:23.920 --> 2:33:32.480]  Now, to see the New World Order try to get me to join one faction or the other by pushing
[2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:36.960]  me into it's all this group or it's all that group, they really hate it when we expose
[2:33:36.960 --> 2:33:41.560]  and know that all these major groups are being controlled and show those nexus points.
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:47.480]  They cannot stand that and they want to sell the public on, I'm saying four or five New
[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:50.440]  World Order guys are robbing the bank, four or five major groups.
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:54.800]  They're saying the same thing and they try to tell people, oh, they're giving aid and
[2:33:54.800 --> 2:33:56.480]  comfort to this group or that group.
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:00.560]  No, we're explaining that there's evil in high places all over the place and they're
[2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:07.160]  all co-equally guilty in all of this, but I think this individual didn't make it public,
[2:34:07.160 --> 2:34:12.400]  this particular disinfo agent, that they were basically this officer of Israel and so that's
[2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:15.360]  going to be, I think, a big problem for them.
[2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:16.360]  Absolutely.
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:21.520]  And listen, in mysterious monuments, I want to make it very plain here.
[2:34:21.520 --> 2:34:27.200]  If you want to see the broad range of this, let me tell people a secret.
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:31.480]  They haven't got this book and they may have even missed it, there's 875 photos and over
[2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:38.680]  600 pages here, but let me reveal something about the Illuminati Elite.
[2:34:38.680 --> 2:34:43.480]  There are two things that are very important to them, believe it or not, and that is death
[2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:44.960]  and money.
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:47.000]  Not their death, but your death.
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:52.920]  They actually believe in blood sacrifice and they believe it as a holy thing that gives
[2:34:52.920 --> 2:34:56.040]  them a great Luciferian energy power.
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:34:58.080]  Now, let me explain something to people.
[2:34:58.080 --> 2:34:59.760]  You say this is crazy text.
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:05.680]  Are you saying that people like Kissinger, the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and all
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:10.160]  of these other, the richest people in the world, you're saying they're interested in
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:11.160]  blood sacrifice?
[2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:13.400]  Yes, let me go a little further.
[2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:15.600]  Go to New York City.
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:18.800]  There are two buildings of interest that are pictured in this book.
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:22.560]  One is the Standard Oil Corporation Building.
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:28.880]  It was built by John D. Rockefeller who founded this incredible oil cartel that is now spiraled
[2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:33.680]  into Exxon, Mobile, Conoco, Phillips and so forth.
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:42.800]  With this vast power around the world, corporate and money power, this oil dictatorship almost.
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:44.680]  Think about this.
[2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:51.800]  It looks like a normal skyscraper, the Standard Oil Building, but on top of it they have built,
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:35:56.560]  get this, a great Greek temple pyramid.
[2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:05.240]  It is exactly the recreation of the mausoleum or the tomb of King Mausolus of ancient Greece.
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:06.880]  What is the meaning of it?
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:14.120]  You see, the very word mausoleum comes from King Mausus who built this fabulous pyramid
[2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:18.760]  shaped tomb for he and his wife in ancient Greece.
[2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:26.800]  It's in ruins today, but Rockefeller believed that he had to build this tomb on top of his
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:30.520]  skyscraper Standard Oil Building.
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:32.520]  But that's not all.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:38.560]  Build down the street to the financial district and there is another building, a huge skyscraper.
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:40.440]  It is a bank building.
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:45.560]  It is the Banker's Trust Building that's owned by the Reichmann family, one of the richest
[2:36:45.560 --> 2:36:49.560]  Illuminati dynasty families from out of Canada, but it's in the United States in New York
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:50.560]  City.
[2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:53.280]  And guess what is on top of the Banker's Trust Building?
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:54.480]  And I have a picture of it.
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:56.640]  The Tomb of Mausolus.
[2:36:56.640 --> 2:36:58.080]  They built it there too.
[2:36:58.080 --> 2:36:59.600]  But wait, I'm not finished.
[2:36:59.600 --> 2:37:05.400]  Let's go to the House of the Temple, the Scottish Rite, the largest Masonic group in the world,
[2:37:05.400 --> 2:37:11.720]  their headquarters, numerologically, according to a cult fact, you know, figuring, 13 blocks
[2:37:11.720 --> 2:37:16.840]  from the White House, and guess what the architect John Pope designed it as?
[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:19.960]  Of course, the Tomb of Mausolus.
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:21.400]  But wait, I'm not finished.
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:22.400]  The Tomb of Mausolus.
[2:37:22.400 --> 2:37:23.680]  I have a picture of it.
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:26.240]  Okay, and they worship the devil inside of it.
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:27.800]  Now, but I'm not finished.
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:34.120]  Go to North Vietnam and go to the, and say, I want to see where Ho Chi Minh, the great
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:38.240]  Communist leader who kicked out the French and the Americans, I want to go to his tomb.
[2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:40.320]  Guess what?
[2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:43.160]  They designed it as the Tomb of Mausolus.
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:44.160]  But I'm not finished.
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:45.160]  I'm not finished.
[2:37:45.160 --> 2:37:47.200]  Let's go to Russia.
[2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:49.640]  You think Lenin was just a Communist?
[2:37:49.640 --> 2:37:50.640]  No.
[2:37:50.640 --> 2:37:56.280]  He was a Marxist, Leninist, Freemason, member of the Illuminati Secret Societies.
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:37:58.000]  That's why he believed in blood.
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:02.440]  That's why he believed in killing millions of people through his gulags.
[2:38:02.440 --> 2:38:07.720]  And what, if you go and visit the great, you know, where his body lies in state, and they
[2:38:07.720 --> 2:38:12.240]  keep it with all kind of fancy olive oils and all kind of things to try to keep it,
[2:38:12.240 --> 2:38:15.320]  you know, still looking like him, under glass.
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:19.480]  I mean, he's a pickled dead man, okay, at the Wynn Museum.
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:20.480]  But guess what?
[2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:22.720]  You'll be surprised.
[2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:26.880]  It's the Tomb of Mausolus, recreated.
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:29.440]  Now, why is this important?
[2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:35.040]  Why then did Obama, when he was given the nomination in his acceptance speech at Denver's
[2:38:35.040 --> 2:38:41.840]  Mile High Stadium, they rebuilt, or they built, I should say, set up the backdrop so
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:51.520]  that it appeared as a Grecian Greek temple, New York Stock Exchange.
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:55.840]  What kind of building do you think that they run around and they're cheating and plundering
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:38:56.840]  the people of America?
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:38:58.000]  No, it's a temple.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:04.120]  It's a Greek temple with a great goddess and devil pedophile men reaching down to grab
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:05.720]  children on each side of her.
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:06.720]  You think I'm kidding you?
[2:39:06.720 --> 2:39:10.880]  I'm telling you, that's the New York Stock Exchange, but it's a Greek temple.
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:11.880]  It's all in Mysterious Monument.
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:12.880]  It's here as well.
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:16.940]  Tell them about the guy that built the stuff in Tennessee, and then there was these rumors
[2:39:16.940 --> 2:39:18.680]  about what was in the pyramid when they got into it.
[2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:19.680]  It really was there.
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:24.440]  Isaac Tigret was head of the founder, a multimillionaire, of Hard Rock Cafes.
[2:39:24.440 --> 2:39:28.240]  Now, you know these t-shirts that run around the kids wear, and they have a great big sun
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:33.840]  sign, just a big sun that says Hard Rock Cafe, because he worshiped the great sun god, or
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:35.360]  I believe Lucifer.
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:40.480]  Mr. Tigret went over to Egypt, and he bribed guards, this is by his own testimony, this
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:44.720]  was in the American Airlines In Flight Magazine, by the way, they had a picture of him, and
[2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:46.720]  I show that in this book.
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:52.160]  He went to Egypt, and he bribed the security guards to let him spend the night alone, deep
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:58.840]  inside the bowels of the pyramid, in the king's chamber, where the empty stone sarcophagus
[2:39:58.840 --> 2:40:00.280]  or coffin is.
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:03.120]  He said that in the deep of night, deep inside the bowels-
[2:40:03.120 --> 2:40:04.440]  Oh, that's what Crowley did that too.
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  Alistair Crowley, the great British Satanist, did the very same thing.
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:10.960]  The man to call himself the beast, 666.
[2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:17.200]  So Isaac Tigret did this, and he said at midnight, a great light came to him.
[2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:23.520]  Now I knew what this was, in the ancient mystery of religions, they call this the sun at midnight.
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:24.520]  It's an occult ritual.
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:25.520]  Black sunshine.
[2:40:25.520 --> 2:40:30.400]  Yeah, and this great light came and illuminated the king's chamber, and they've always told
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:38.400]  him, Isaac Tigret, you must go to the United States, to the city of Memphis, the sister
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:45.160]  city of Memphis in Egypt, and build a great American pyramid like this one.
[2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:46.160]  He did it.
[2:40:46.160 --> 2:40:47.280]  He went to Memphis.
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:51.480]  Here this multimillionaire went, and he teamed up with the head of the Denver basketball
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:56.840]  team, Sidney Schlenker, whose wife was arrested for drugs, that's all another cocaine and
[2:40:56.840 --> 2:40:57.840]  everything.
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:40:58.840]  That's another story.
[2:40:58.840 --> 2:41:03.400]  But they got together with the city fathers of Memphis, and they built the great American
[2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:04.920]  pyramid.
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:11.920]  Now many people began this rumor, this gossip, these crazy people, these conspiracy theorists
[2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:19.480]  said that at the very apex of that building, that Isaac Tigret had placed a small, a steel
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:25.840]  box, a secret little box, about the size of a cigar box, and in it was something that
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:29.600]  would prove that that building was dedicated to the devil.
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:32.080]  Well, everybody laughed about it.
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:36.680]  Even the mayor and the city council, but it got so bad, you know, because Memphis has
[2:41:36.680 --> 2:41:41.240]  a big history of voodoo and such there in Tennessee, that city of Memphis.
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:43.280]  They said, we've got to dispel the rumors.
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:47.600]  They took a huge crane in there, believe it or not, spent thousands of dollars, went all
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:52.600]  the way to the top to the apex, and said, look for a box that supposedly welded to the
[2:41:52.600 --> 2:41:55.840]  girders right at the top of the pyramid.
[2:41:55.840 --> 2:41:56.840]  They found it.
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:41:59.880]  He had paid work when there was a box.
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:04.680]  They took it now, this was in the commercial appeal, the Memphis news, you have that in
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:05.680]  the book.
[2:42:05.680 --> 2:42:06.680]  Absolutely.
[2:42:06.680 --> 2:42:11.080]  Have a picture of Tigret giving his Illuminati hand signs, secret sand signs, by the way,
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:13.800]  hand signs, and as above so below.
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:19.800]  But listen to this, when the city fathers with the cameras wearing opened it up, they found
[2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:28.480]  a velvet pouch, and they opened it up and there was a crystal skull, a crystal skull,
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:30.520]  there were some other artifacts in there too.
[2:42:30.520 --> 2:42:34.080]  So again, many buildings are dedicated to devils.
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:38.560]  Now I want to tell people something, they won't believe this, but it's true.
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:44.520]  Underneath the US Capitol building, and remember the great goddess of where, Greece, stands
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:46.120]  atop it.
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:53.040]  The great goddess of the ancients stands atop our capital, and she was placed there in 1860,
[2:42:53.040 --> 2:43:00.200]  because that is numerically coded as 666, and the occult numerological calculations.
[2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:08.400]  But underneath the rotunda of the US Capitol building, there is a crypt, and there is a
[2:43:08.400 --> 2:43:15.760]  wrought iron area and a recess, and there is a stone sarcophagus, just like deep in
[2:43:15.760 --> 2:43:17.800]  the bowels of the pyramid.
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:18.800]  It's underneath.
[2:43:18.800 --> 2:43:25.080]  So I've had secular academics on from Canada, their places where they talk about the Capitol
[2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:26.080]  buildings there.
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:27.080]  Oh yeah, and Winnipeg?
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:28.080]  Unbelievable.
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:34.160]  And 666 calculations, it's got a sarcophagus, and they admit they shut it down into rituals
[2:43:34.160 --> 2:43:35.160]  in there.
[2:43:35.160 --> 2:43:39.800]  Now Obama figures into this, you see, according to the Illuminati elite, they have two scenarios.
[2:43:39.800 --> 2:43:44.480]  Either one is workable, according to how they can rig the election, the voting machines
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:45.480]  and such.
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:50.920]  They have McCain and Palin on one side, and McCain will step down, if he becomes president,
[2:43:50.920 --> 2:43:56.280]  he will step down because of his illness, Palin will be the new esther of Israel.
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:44:00.200]  There's some ramifications there we won't talk about now, but she has been chosen for
[2:44:00.200 --> 2:44:02.160]  that very purpose, okay?
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:06.760]  Now on the other side, if Obama and Biden get in, they have things working out there.
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:11.680]  You know Joe Biden, and you quoted him earlier, Joe Biden gave a speech yesterday in which
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:17.400]  he talked about this great event that is going to occur, by the way, just up on prisonplanet.com,
[2:44:17.400 --> 2:44:18.400]  just broken.
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:22.640]  Colin Powell warns of coming crisis we don't even know about yet, European Union head,
[2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:23.640]  British head.
[2:44:23.640 --> 2:44:29.680]  They say a huge attack is coming as soon as he gets inaugurated to test them and to test
[2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:30.680]  us.
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:31.680]  Yeah.
[2:44:31.680 --> 2:44:34.120]  So they're, I mean, they're, I mean, these guys, just like 9-11, they said, get ready.
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:36.400]  That's why I went on errands that they'll probably attack the World Trade Center.
[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:38.480]  I mean, not even hard to predict.
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:40.500]  They are getting us ready, Tex.
[2:44:40.500 --> 2:44:41.500]  They are.
[2:44:41.500 --> 2:44:46.480]  They said, you know, not only they're going to attack, they're going to test Obama, but
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:54.280]  he said it for Obama, this task will be as if he is going to be forced or given the mission
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:44:59.040]  of cleaning out, now get this, the Aegean stables.
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:00.520]  What was that all about?
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:02.520]  The Aegean stables.
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:03.520]  Hercules.
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:04.520]  Hercules.
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:07.280]  He's going to be the new Hercules, the son of Zeus.
[2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:08.280]  That's the reason for his great thing.
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:11.640]  It's like they called the bombing thing in Iraq, shock and awe.
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:12.640]  Shock and awe.
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:15.880]  And, and, I mean, explain that.
[2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:17.880]  I mean, they are obsessed with religion.
[2:45:17.880 --> 2:45:23.720]  And then I notice all the newagers and stuff, they'll claim their atheists and attack me.
[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:24.720]  And they always attack Christianity.
[2:45:24.720 --> 2:45:28.880]  But then you find out very soon that most of the atheist groups, they're openly occultists.
[2:45:28.880 --> 2:45:29.880]  They don't even hide it.
[2:45:29.880 --> 2:45:33.520]  So they say, your stuff doesn't exist, but our God does.
[2:45:33.520 --> 2:45:35.240]  Well, think of communism.
[2:45:35.240 --> 2:45:38.840]  You think of them as the ultimate in atheism.
[2:45:38.840 --> 2:45:42.920]  And yet Marx's, Karl Marx's own, he's the father of it all, right?
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:49.320]  With his theology, his ideology of Marxism in his books, Das Kapital and the Communist
[2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:50.820]  Manifesto.
[2:45:50.820 --> 2:45:56.400]  But, but Marx, his own housekeeper said, had a, in his apartment, had a small room set
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:46:02.320]  aside and had black candles and would put one of these Jewish prophylactic things around
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:06.320]  his head and would worship the devil.
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:07.320]  He was a devil.
[2:46:07.320 --> 2:46:10.680]  They have a God all right, but it's not our God, it's the devil.
[2:46:10.680 --> 2:46:16.440]  And this devil is tied to all of these ancient mystery religions of Greece, Rome, Babylon,
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:18.480]  and so forth.
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:21.120]  But I want people to understand this.
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:27.200]  The Aegean stables that Biden says, Obama is going to be tested and have to clean out.
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:30.960]  This is from the labors, the 12 labors of Hercules.
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:36.880]  And one of them, he was so powerful, he diverted the waters and the great of this great river
[2:46:36.880 --> 2:46:41.000]  and the waters came forth and they cleaned out the stables.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:45.240]  So the great waters, the dangers, and of course this all relates.
[2:46:45.240 --> 2:46:49.480]  And it's also saying, and he's saying he's going to have carbon taxes.
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:54.440]  He's saying he's going to bring in regulating every facet of our lives, controlling us.
[2:46:54.440 --> 2:46:58.960]  I mean, we, people are thinking, oh, change, change, regardless of what happens, we're
[2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:03.600]  about to see, folks, all the craziness you've seen, this is nothing compared to what's going
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:04.600]  to happen now.
[2:47:04.600 --> 2:47:07.520]  I mean, from a secular perspective, it's bad enough.
[2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:09.680]  And these people are occultic nutcases.
[2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:10.680]  I mean, we're...
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:11.680]  Well, they are.
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:12.680]  You know, we're not there.
[2:47:12.680 --> 2:47:13.880]  They say, Alex, I'm not religious.
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:14.880]  I'm not spiritual.
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:15.880]  I don't lie.
[2:47:15.880 --> 2:47:18.240]  Why don't you just stick with politics and economics?
[2:47:18.240 --> 2:47:23.360]  Hey, hey, it's not us to set up the religious round table with Henry Kissinger and Rick
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:26.480]  Warren, America's so-called pastor, a number one...
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:30.920]  Hey, on the Bohemian Grove headquarters in San Francisco, on the Bohemian Grove headquarters
[2:47:30.920 --> 2:47:35.800]  in San Francisco, it's guys in hoods carved in stone with a baby throwing it in fire.
[2:47:35.800 --> 2:47:41.560]  Yeah, worshiping a great god, Moloch, who, by the way, was the great god of credit and
[2:47:41.560 --> 2:47:42.560]  money.
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:43.560]  Yeah.
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:44.560]  Back in the Canaanites.
[2:47:44.560 --> 2:47:45.560]  That was the big bull.
[2:47:45.560 --> 2:47:48.080]  And then occultists always have double and triple meanings.
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:52.920]  We know that it's not an owl, but they're calling it Moloch and saying it's an owl.
[2:47:52.920 --> 2:47:56.200]  You have to understand there's always a feminine and a masculine aspect.
[2:47:56.200 --> 2:48:00.600]  No, I know that, but then all the occultists get mad at me for talking about it, but being
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:05.360]  in the hidden, none of them ever attack me on criticizing it.
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:08.640]  They make up lies and say I'm wrong and don't understand the occult.
[2:48:08.640 --> 2:48:12.960]  Just like I had the Bohemian Grove Action Network and other people get real mad at me
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:13.960]  for talking about it.
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:14.960]  They were doing rituals there.
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:18.680]  They said, stick to the politics, and then we showed up and saw the local leaders with
[2:48:18.680 --> 2:48:19.680]  the witches pot.
[2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:25.360]  It's in order of death, doing their own spell with the state police guarding them.
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:31.960]  So they always say, oh, be an atheist, and then you show up and they're, well, they're
[2:48:31.960 --> 2:48:34.440]  opposed to Christianity.
[2:48:34.440 --> 2:48:37.040]  And actually they hate Islam.
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:38.800]  And let me go even one step further.
[2:48:38.800 --> 2:48:41.560]  They hate the Old Testament God of the Jews, too.
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:43.560]  So let's go to all the monotheistic religions.
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:45.280]  Let's try to be clear that they all be ended.
[2:48:45.280 --> 2:48:46.280]  Let's be clear.
[2:48:46.280 --> 2:48:48.040]  The Jews were captured and brought into Babylon.
[2:48:48.040 --> 2:48:54.080]  That's where they got the Talmud and the Zoroaster and all those other books.
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:48:57.520]  Yeah, and even brought in the worship of Moloch and all of these false gods.
[2:48:57.520 --> 2:48:58.520]  And that's why Jesus said...
[2:48:58.520 --> 2:48:59.520]  The Zohar.
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:00.520]  What's the other one, son?
[2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:03.960]  Well, there's the Zohar, which is the book of splendor.
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:07.040]  There's a number of a cabalistic books.
[2:49:07.040 --> 2:49:09.200]  But that's all post Old Testament.
[2:49:09.200 --> 2:49:10.200]  That's, yeah.
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:11.200]  But they brought it together.
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:17.040]  Albert Pike, who wrote the classic Masonic textbook, Morals and Dogma, said that Jewish
[2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:21.240]  cabalism is the very foundation of Freemasonry.
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:25.840]  So all of these things, and the ancient mystery religions, they all come together.
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:27.400]  You mentioned this nexus.
[2:49:27.400 --> 2:49:28.400]  There is a nexus.
[2:49:28.400 --> 2:49:33.040]  There is an intersection of evil in which all of these groups, political, economic and
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:35.240]  spiritual, come together.
[2:49:35.240 --> 2:49:37.640]  Now let's get back to this Obama.
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:44.280]  Is he going to be the great leader of Sparta, the great God of the Greeks?
[2:49:44.280 --> 2:49:50.200]  And is this the reason why, in Mysterious Monuments, I point out that the Greek...
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:52.400]  You know, I have Greek friends, I cannot...
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:56.760]  We have major newspapers now saying, he's like Jesus, Biden's saying he's worshiping
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:49:57.760]  him.
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:02.240]  When he was in Berlin, they gave that great speech before hundreds of thousands of Berliners.
[2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:08.120]  They made sure the backdrop was the great phallic pole with the great goddess, Victory.
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  Okay?
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:10.620]  On top of it.
[2:50:10.620 --> 2:50:12.400]  So this is very symbolic.
[2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:14.160]  Everything is symbolic.
[2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:18.680]  And we have to keep in mind that these people are deep into symbology.
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:20.960]  And these things have meaning for them.
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:24.040]  By the way, years ago, you said Madonna was doing rituals on stage.
[2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:25.040]  They laughed at you.
[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:27.560]  Now she admits it's been rituals for over a decade.
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:30.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:34.640]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[2:50:34.640 --> 2:50:38.440]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[2:50:38.440 --> 2:50:39.440]  Most of which are synthetic.
[2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:40.440]  Hi, folks.

[2:51:29.840 --> 2:51:35.000]  Today unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:36.520]  against this country.
[2:51:36.520 --> 2:51:39.360]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:51:39.360 --> 2:51:40.360]  Who is the enemy?
[2:51:40.360 --> 2:51:41.360]  Bin Laden.
[2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:42.360]  This is his M.O.
[2:51:42.360 --> 2:51:45.800]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:51:45.800 --> 2:51:50.480]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:53.080]  networks inside the United States.
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:57.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[2:51:57.560 --> 2:51:59.720]  in and on the U.S.
[2:51:59.720 --> 2:52:03.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:08.880]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:12.880]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much
[2:52:12.880 --> 2:52:13.880]  much more.
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:14.880]  Fabled Enemies.

[2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:34.960]  or worse.
[2:52:34.960 --> 2:52:38.360]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep
[2:52:38.360 --> 2:52:40.480]  these safety tips in mind.
[2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:42.760]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[2:52:42.760 --> 2:52:45.600]  Walk on well that pass with friends or students.
[2:52:45.600 --> 2:52:48.380]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[2:52:48.380 --> 2:52:50.480]  Know how to reach campus security.
[2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:53.920]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:56.720]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[2:53:31.240 --> 2:53:35.720]  The elite loves telling us big stuff's coming in the future, big terror attacks.
[2:53:35.720 --> 2:53:38.840]  It's a message to all their cronies that it's an inside job.
[2:53:38.840 --> 2:53:42.200]  They love to throw it in our face right now in PrisonPlanet.com.
[2:53:42.200 --> 2:53:43.200]  Very important article.
[2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:46.360]  Colin Powell warns of coming in crisis we don't even know about.
[2:53:46.360 --> 2:53:52.120]  Because now the public will see Obama as somebody new and then, oh, we've been hit again by
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:53.120]  terrorists.
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:55.520]  We've got to take even more freedoms and liberties.
[2:53:55.520 --> 2:53:56.520]  So incredible to see this.
[2:53:56.520 --> 2:54:01.720]  You were just showing me during the break, one of the mausoleums, a mausolus, one of the
[2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:06.640]  largest banks in the world is taking a new path to intercept the future.
[2:54:06.640 --> 2:54:13.120]  And there it is from their own ad, showing everyone, you were making a point about Greece
[2:54:13.120 --> 2:54:14.120]  when we went into the break.
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:20.880]  I think about this though, death and money, talk about a nexus, death and money.
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:24.440]  So here is an actual tomb atop the banker's trust bill.
[2:54:24.440 --> 2:54:27.360]  Actually, it's a Greek temple atop that.
[2:54:27.360 --> 2:54:32.600]  You know, in the Bible, it's interesting, the book of Daniel says the last day's world
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:42.040]  kingdom, okay, the last day's new world order and its leader will come out of not Egypt,
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:44.560]  not even Israel, but Greece.
[2:54:44.560 --> 2:54:49.160]  That sort of doesn't say that he will be racially Greece, but the kingdom will have sort of a
[2:54:49.160 --> 2:54:55.320]  Grecian theme, the way Obama had the Grecian backdrop when he accepted the nomination.
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:54:57.280]  And all the last monuments are like that.
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:55:02.400]  Yeah, so this Greek thing, one of the top occultists in the world is a man named Jeffrey
[2:55:02.400 --> 2:55:03.400]  Hodson.
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:06.600]  He wrote a book called The Brotherhood of Angels and Men.
[2:55:06.600 --> 2:55:11.200]  He's so much dark angels, of course, and how men should communicate with them.
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:17.280]  And his spirits, these demons told him, we are Greece reincarnate.
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:19.560]  I think that's sort of an interesting thing.
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:25.480]  But wait, the Zionist have brought back the mystery religions, because just as you well-stated,
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:31.280]  even Jesus said, he noted that they came from Babylon and the Babylonians and the Greeks
[2:55:31.280 --> 2:55:35.280]  and the Romans and the Egyptians all had basically the same religion.
[2:55:35.280 --> 2:55:39.360]  They worshiped the unholy trinity, the father, son, God.
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:42.040]  And that's how no matter what group it is, it's the same religion.
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:43.040]  Absolutely.
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:47.480]  And that's why Zeus is actually Neptune or Poseidon.
[2:55:47.480 --> 2:55:52.560]  That's why the goddess is not only in her guise as the Statue of Liberty, but the Statue
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:55.960]  of Freedom atop the U.S. Capitol building.
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:55:59.880]  And she has been called the goddess of a thousand names, by the way.
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:01.880]  So you see her statue ever.
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:04.600]  Mother Russia has a great goddess statue.
[2:56:04.600 --> 2:56:10.800]  There's a great goddess inside a rebuilt Greek temple to Athena called the Parthenon
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:13.200]  in Nashville, Tennessee.
[2:56:13.200 --> 2:56:16.920]  And you'll remember that the Vanderbilt family had a lot to do with that kind of thing.
[2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:19.000]  It's always the Rachelites that build these temples.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:20.000]  Absolutely.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  We go, oh, what a nice building.
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  They're just everywhere.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:24.640]  Well, Vanderbilt built the Grand Central Terminal.
[2:56:24.640 --> 2:56:26.240]  He was a railroad magnate.
[2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:31.960]  He built the Grand Central Terminal in New York City, which is a great Greek temple.
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:36.240]  And the great God Hermes is a top it.
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:42.600]  And by the way, he's holding, he was also called Mercury, and he's holding the Caduceus,
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:47.800]  the two serpents, Yin and the Yang, as above so below, with a phallic pole in his hand.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:54.000]  And that stands, this great statue of Hermes or Mercury, this great God from the Roman
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:57:01.080]  Egyptian pantheon of gods, stands atop the Grand Central Terminal, a railroad station,
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:04.320]  which has been made in sort of a museum now, in New York City.
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:09.920]  Overlooking the great city, just as the great temple and the great goddess overlook Wall
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:10.920]  Street.
[2:57:10.920 --> 2:57:15.960]  So we have to understand that these mystery religions are tied in with the Illuminati
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:18.720]  elite, and everything has been set out.
[2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:19.720]  There is an agenda.
[2:57:19.720 --> 2:57:24.840]  Now, this great event that's going to occur, I want people to understand something.
[2:57:24.840 --> 2:57:30.720]  Member Biden said, we're going to have to clean out the Aegean stables, okay?
[2:57:30.720 --> 2:57:36.160]  It's one of the labors of Hercules, the great God who was the son of Zeus.
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:44.200]  Now, in front of the Rockefeller Center in New York City is a great statue of the son
[2:57:44.200 --> 2:57:46.560]  of Zeus.
[2:57:46.560 --> 2:57:53.120]  And in stone on the wall of the Rockefeller Center, there in New York City, is a great
[2:57:53.120 --> 2:57:56.720]  image carved in stone of Zeus.
[2:57:56.720 --> 2:58:01.080]  And he's holding the Masonic compass in his hand, surveying the whole globe.
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:04.320]  So you find this Zeus, and you find his son.
[2:58:04.320 --> 2:58:05.320]  Stay there, Tex.
[2:58:05.320 --> 2:58:06.320]  Final segment.
[2:58:06.320 --> 2:58:08.400]  We're going to be back in one minute with Tex Mars.
[2:58:08.400 --> 2:58:11.080]  In fact, John, let's go ahead and skip this break.
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:13.960]  I want to talk to this one minute with Tex, and we'll come back to the full audience in
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:14.960]  70 seconds.
[2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:17.520]  Man, Tex, this went by too quick.
[2:58:17.520 --> 2:58:18.520]  Yeah, it did.
[2:58:18.520 --> 2:58:19.520]  Yeah.
[2:58:19.520 --> 2:58:20.520]  But it's fun.
[2:58:20.520 --> 2:58:21.520]  Well, I can do this.
[2:58:21.520 --> 2:58:25.240]  I can hold you to 15 after, and then I just won't be able to walk you out.
[2:58:25.240 --> 2:58:26.240]  I can just say bye to you.
[2:58:26.240 --> 2:58:27.240]  Sure.
[2:58:27.240 --> 2:58:28.240]  You want to do it that way?
[2:58:28.240 --> 2:58:29.240]  Let's do that.
[2:58:29.240 --> 2:58:30.240]  Okay.
[2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:31.240]  Do me a favor.
[2:58:31.240 --> 2:58:34.320]  John, call Webster Tarpley right now and just say we're going to call him about 10 after
[2:58:34.320 --> 2:58:35.320]  that we're behind.
[2:58:35.320 --> 2:58:37.320]  Will you do that for me, John?
[2:58:37.320 --> 2:58:38.320]  I sure will.
[2:58:38.320 --> 2:58:39.320]  Fantastic.
[2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:41.160]  Because I want to let Tex finish up.
[2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:44.920]  He's got all these notes we haven't even gotten to maybe just rapid fire.
[2:58:44.920 --> 2:58:48.320]  Go through those for everybody that is out there.
[2:58:48.320 --> 2:58:53.040]  You know, we need to talk about that, that great event that Colin Powell says is going
[2:58:53.040 --> 2:58:54.040]  to occur.
[2:58:54.040 --> 2:58:55.040]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[2:58:55.040 --> 2:59:02.320]  Here, remember that Colin Powell, this weekend, when he endorsed Obama for president, called
[2:59:02.320 --> 2:59:03.720]  him a transformational.
[2:59:03.720 --> 2:59:06.120]  No, that's what they're all saying.
[2:59:06.120 --> 2:59:12.920]  Yeah, we're going into the transformation, and they need to get the left, and the Hispanics,
[2:59:12.920 --> 2:59:17.760]  blacks, and others, you know, he's seen worldwide as all the racist Americans have got a black
[2:59:17.760 --> 2:59:18.760]  guy.
[2:59:18.760 --> 2:59:22.840]  You know, again, it's just a front or a cover, and then they believe that he'll be able to
[2:59:22.840 --> 2:59:26.760]  get by with much more than an old white guy would be able to.
[2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:28.240]  I really think it's going to be Obama.
[2:59:28.240 --> 2:59:29.480]  I may be proven wrong.
[2:59:29.480 --> 2:59:38.600]  Here we go.
[2:59:38.600 --> 2:59:44.040]  We are now into our number four Webster Tire Play, coming up in about 12, 14 minutes from
[2:59:44.040 --> 2:59:49.280]  now, continuing with the election discussion, whether you believe in this or not.
[2:59:49.280 --> 2:59:55.320]  We are secularly, Texans have to be Christians, but that doesn't, quote, taint our view as
[2:59:55.320 --> 2:59:56.320]  some would say.
[2:59:56.320 --> 3:00:01.880]  We are just analytically, like anthropologists, studying, like we were studying, say, ancient
[3:00:01.880 --> 3:00:02.880]  China.
[3:00:02.880 --> 3:00:04.600]  You know, what did the Ming dynasty worship?
[3:00:04.600 --> 3:00:10.000]  Well, they were these pantheists, or they were these animists, or they were Buddhists,
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  or whatever they were.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:15.240]  The point is, we are just reporting on the mindset of the elites.
[3:00:15.240 --> 3:00:18.160]  If you're tracking serial killers, you study what the serial killers' beliefs are.
[3:00:18.160 --> 3:00:21.280]  If you're tracking somebody else, we're studying this.
[3:00:21.280 --> 3:00:22.480]  They are depacultists.
[3:00:22.480 --> 3:00:23.920]  They're obsessed with it.
[3:00:23.920 --> 3:00:24.920]  It's all they do.
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:27.320]  It's all they spend time doing.
[3:00:27.320 --> 3:00:31.480]  Tex, this great event that Colin Powell and Joe Biden and the media and the British prime
[3:00:31.480 --> 3:00:34.880]  minister and the European leaders, they say something huge is coming.
[3:00:34.880 --> 3:00:36.760]  We know what it is, but we won't tell you.
[3:00:36.760 --> 3:00:41.880]  The media says, oh, gee, okay, we won't even ask what it is, because they all know how
[3:00:41.880 --> 3:00:43.440]  to be good little minions.
[3:00:43.440 --> 3:00:46.240]  Tex Mars, what is this big event, do you think?
[3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:50.960]  Well, we have to look at what Obama has been aiming for, okay?
[3:00:50.960 --> 3:00:54.000]  Now, Brzezinski is one of his handlers.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:58.440]  Brzezinski, of course, was head of the National Security Council under Jimmy Carter, remember
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:06.240]  the CFR, the trial, in fact, he co-founded the trial at all commission with Rockefeller,
[3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:08.640]  and he is a hater of Russia.
[3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:14.120]  Now, they have developed a new stable of enemies, okay?
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:15.640]  These are the new enemies.
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:21.000]  It's like 1984, ever so often they have a new stable, talk about the AG and stables.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:23.280]  Well, here's the new stable of enemies.
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:24.280]  It's Pakistan.
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:28.040]  Remember, this is an Islamic nation of 170 million people.
[3:01:28.040 --> 3:01:32.120]  This is the government that Israel, the U.S. and England gave nukes to.
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:33.120]  Oh, yes.
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:34.920]  Oh, and now, oh, a big problem.
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:40.120]  Well, the problem is that an Islamic nation, okay, has nukes.
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:46.800]  Now, Musharraf was basically kicked out, forced out, and now the husband of Benazir Bouto,
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:51.880]  he's a very weak man, but he's a good man, he is the new president of Pakistan.
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:56.000]  But he is not pro-America or pro-Israel or pro-Illuminati.
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  Enough.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  That's right.
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:00.440]  Now, Benazir Bouto, the lady who was assassinated.
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:02.920]  They machined under on TV and said she hit her head.
[3:02:02.920 --> 3:02:03.920]  Yeah.
[3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:04.920]  Just like Kennedy.
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:06.920]  They should have just said Kennedy hit his head.
[3:02:06.920 --> 3:02:10.280]  They had gone on the David Frost show just a couple of, several weeks ago.
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:11.280]  I said Ben Laden's been dead.
[3:02:11.280 --> 3:02:12.280]  It's all staged.
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:13.280]  Ben Laden is dead.
[3:02:13.280 --> 3:02:14.280]  Ben Laden is dead.
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:15.880]  The same people that kill him are now wanting to kill me.
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:21.000]  But Ben Laden is needed as to be the boogeyman, as Aukmanatajed is needed.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:22.840]  The excuse to go into Pakistan.
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:23.840]  That's right.
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:26.040]  Next year, Aukmanatajed is leaving office.
[3:02:26.040 --> 3:02:28.960]  He's very unpopular, and by the way, he is an elected leader.
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:33.520]  He's not a dictator, and it looks like he will be kicked out of office, but they need
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:37.720]  him as well as Ben Laden to be the two boogeymen of the world.
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:44.920]  So I believe that Pakistan, and Russia, and Iran are all going to figure in this great
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:46.560]  transformational event.
[3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:47.720]  And that's going to be war.
[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:50.360]  Oh, it's going to be World War III.
[3:02:50.360 --> 3:02:52.560]  And by the way, what we're going to see right now-
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:02:54.760]  And by the way, we kept saying they're going to attack Iraq.
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:55.760]  They're going to attack Iraq.
[3:02:55.760 --> 3:02:56.760]  And they said, oh, shut up.
[3:02:56.760 --> 3:02:58.040]  You keep saying it's this month or next month.
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:02:59.040]  No, we don't.
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:00.040]  We say they're gearing up.
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:01.040]  They've said they're going to do it.
[3:03:01.040 --> 3:03:02.040]  Yeah.
[3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:04.480]  And then we said Iraq, and they ended up doing it.
[3:03:04.480 --> 3:03:05.480]  And they're gearing up.
[3:03:05.480 --> 3:03:08.400]  I mean, they just snuck attack Russia through Georgia.
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:10.000]  So folks, this is serious.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  Well, the new prime minister of Israel has yet to take office, Zippy Livny, I think her
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  name is.
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:20.880]  She's the foreign minister, has been.
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:22.320]  She's a lacudnik all the way.
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:26.360]  She's for bomb, bomb, bomb Iran, you know, the Beach Boys.
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:29.680]  She could sing a little duet with McCain if he were in office.
[3:03:29.680 --> 3:03:32.100]  So she is a very deadly person.
[3:03:32.100 --> 3:03:36.120]  If she doesn't get it, of course, if Nate and Yahoo somehow slides in there, he again
[3:03:36.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  is a freemason.
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:38.120]  He is admitted.
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:43.720]  I was initiated in a freemasonry when he went to the university here in the United States.
[3:03:43.720 --> 3:03:47.200]  So we have these lacudniks who want to go to war right away.
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:52.080]  But more than that, we have the Kabbalistic rabbis behind this.
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:58.480]  And they have a great agenda of the ages to bring forth a new order of the ages.
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:02.920]  And remember the head rabbi said that Bush said that Bush told him privately, don't worry
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:04.200]  Iran will be attacked.
[3:04:04.200 --> 3:04:05.200]  Yes.
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:11.560]  Now they believe that the West, the leader of the West is the head of Gog and Magog.
[3:04:11.560 --> 3:04:12.680]  Now this may sound strange.
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:17.520]  These names Gog and Magog, but that's in the Bible in Ezekiel 38.
[3:04:17.520 --> 3:04:23.920]  They believe the role of the West, the role of the leaders of the West is to attack in
[3:04:23.920 --> 3:04:27.640]  the Middle East to smash all the enemies of Israel.
[3:04:27.640 --> 3:04:29.680]  Let them turn and be smashed themselves.
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:31.680]  We're going to skip this break too.
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:32.680]  Go ahead.
[3:04:32.680 --> 3:04:33.680]  I just have to skip breaks.
[3:04:33.680 --> 3:04:34.680]  We're going to have you continue.
[3:04:34.680 --> 3:04:35.680]  Okay.
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:36.680]  You don't have headphones on.
[3:04:36.680 --> 3:04:37.680]  Did you talk to Tarpley?
[3:04:37.680 --> 3:04:38.680]  John?
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:39.680]  He's waiting in the wings.
[3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:41.680]  He's going to hold till you're done with this.
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:42.680]  Okay.
[3:04:42.680 --> 3:04:45.000]  We're going to come back to him in the next break for Webster.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  Okay.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  Finish up with what you were saying.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  Well, we're going to see definitely a transformational event.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:52.880]  And certainly Obama will be tested.
[3:04:52.880 --> 3:04:57.480]  But it'll all be a staged event, okay?
[3:04:57.480 --> 3:04:59.160]  Everything is in place now.
[3:04:59.160 --> 3:05:03.160]  All the pieces of the puzzle, it's like a great Broadway production.
[3:05:03.160 --> 3:05:07.120]  And they bring in this actor and that actor and this backdrop and this backdrop and the
[3:05:07.120 --> 3:05:08.440]  curtains are ready.
[3:05:08.440 --> 3:05:11.360]  And of course, everything's set up to go.
[3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:15.700]  This is the deal with Obama and it'll happen even if McCain and Palin get in.
[3:05:15.700 --> 3:05:20.240]  But I agree with you, it'll probably be Obama because he's younger, he's more capable, he's
[3:05:20.240 --> 3:05:21.240]  ready to go.
[3:05:21.240 --> 3:05:22.400]  He can sucker the public.
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:24.280]  He can sucker the public better.
[3:05:24.280 --> 3:05:27.360]  And Americans are always on a honeymoon with the new president.
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:28.360]  They give him a certain amount of time.
[3:05:28.360 --> 3:05:30.800]  And McCain's kind of seen as a Bush 3.
[3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:31.800]  Yeah.
[3:05:31.800 --> 3:05:32.800]  McCain is a Bush 3.
[3:05:32.800 --> 3:05:33.800]  He's older.
[3:05:33.800 --> 3:05:34.800]  This guy's more vigorous.
[3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:37.120]  He is ready to go.
[3:05:37.120 --> 3:05:42.320]  And so when this transformational event that will catapult him into becoming a transformational
[3:05:42.320 --> 3:05:45.520]  president, this great event occurs.
[3:05:45.520 --> 3:05:50.640]  It will literally be something so amazing, it will make 9-11 look puny.
[3:05:50.640 --> 3:05:52.920]  Well, they're saying it's going to be nukes.
[3:05:52.920 --> 3:05:53.920]  That's an AFP today.
[3:05:53.920 --> 3:05:54.920]  Yeah.
[3:05:54.920 --> 3:05:55.920]  They're saying we're going to get hit by nukes.
[3:05:55.920 --> 3:05:57.320]  And I don't know if that's the case.
[3:05:57.320 --> 3:06:02.840]  It will probably, if they blame it on Hezbollah or the al-Qaeda and say that Iran and Syria
[3:06:02.840 --> 3:06:08.600]  masterminded it, masterminded it, it will be discovered by the intelligence agencies
[3:06:08.600 --> 3:06:15.840]  that Putin and Russia and somehow the ISI, the intelligence agency of Pakistan were involved.
[3:06:15.840 --> 3:06:19.400]  These are the new enemies of the new world order.
[3:06:19.400 --> 3:06:20.400]  But guess what?
[3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:21.400]  They have nukes.
[3:06:21.400 --> 3:06:27.200]  It will be World War III and it will end with horrible, horrible destruction.
[3:06:27.200 --> 3:06:29.120]  So don't even think about Wall Street.
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:30.920]  I see a little blip upward.
[3:06:30.920 --> 3:06:34.120]  I see a little sucker rally for people to get involved in it.
[3:06:34.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  Dead cat bounce.
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:36.120]  The dead cat bounce.
[3:06:36.120 --> 3:06:37.120]  That's right.
[3:06:37.120 --> 3:06:43.040]  They throw it off of the bankers trust building, the tomb of mausolus down on Wall Street below.
[3:06:43.040 --> 3:06:44.200]  And it bounces.
[3:06:44.200 --> 3:06:45.400]  One big bounce.
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:46.400]  People get in.
[3:06:46.400 --> 3:06:47.560]  They say everything is over.
[3:06:47.560 --> 3:06:49.480]  Everything is going to be great again.
[3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:54.720]  And by the way, one of the things that they're doing is driving the price of oil down now.
[3:06:54.720 --> 3:07:00.000]  They drove it up and now the same people, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, they're analysts
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  are putting out reports.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Oil is going to go down.
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:07.160]  I was reading that upwards of 90% of the oil speculation was driven by Goldman Sachs.
[3:07:07.160 --> 3:07:08.160]  Yeah.
[3:07:08.160 --> 3:07:09.160]  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
[3:07:09.160 --> 3:07:12.840]  They're the only two left standing, by the way, with the great big...
[3:07:12.840 --> 3:07:16.320]  So we also have this vertical integration happening.
[3:07:16.320 --> 3:07:17.320]  Yeah.
[3:07:17.320 --> 3:07:19.000]  And Goldman Sachs, you have Henry Paulson there.
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:23.720]  And by the way, before him, the Clinton administration had Robert Rubin, who came from what Wall
[3:07:23.720 --> 3:07:24.720]  Street firm?
[3:07:24.720 --> 3:07:25.720]  Goldman Sachs.
[3:07:25.720 --> 3:07:27.520]  Well, Goldman Sachs and Mr. Neil Kashkerry.
[3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:28.520]  Okay.
[3:07:28.520 --> 3:07:29.520]  Goldman Sachs.
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:30.520]  Goldman Sachs.
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:31.520]  Of course.
[3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:32.520]  There they are.
[3:07:32.520 --> 3:07:33.520]  Hold on.
[3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:34.520]  Final segment.
[3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:35.520]  We're going to Tarpley here in a moment.
[3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:36.520]  Here we go.
[3:07:36.520 --> 3:07:37.520]  On the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:37.520 --> 3:07:40.520]  In just a couple of minutes, we're going to Webster Tarpley for the rest of the hour.
[3:07:40.520 --> 3:07:43.600]  Really appreciate him joining us to track what's happening with the election.
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:50.080]  Wow, Texmars and Webster Tarpley agreeing that Obama is the New World Order's man.
[3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.880]  I tell you, it's getting crazier and crazier.
[3:07:52.880 --> 3:07:57.320]  Get his book, Mysterious Monuments, what these nuts are into, at infowars.com.
[3:07:57.320 --> 3:07:58.320]  Amazing.
[3:07:58.320 --> 3:08:06.920]  But we've been talking about her cultural free-to-get-a-day, 2-5-3, 3-1-3-9, triple-8-2-5-3, 3-1-3-9.
[3:08:06.920 --> 3:08:08.200]  And you'll be able to watch this video.
[3:08:08.200 --> 3:08:10.840]  We're doing live right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:08:10.840 --> 3:08:12.920]  That's posted for the members.
[3:08:12.920 --> 3:08:13.920]  There as well.
[3:08:13.920 --> 3:08:18.120]  Just in two minutes' closing, and for Tarpley, I want to get his comment on this as soon
[3:08:18.120 --> 3:08:25.720]  as you leave us, Colin Powell, Gordon Brown, we've got Nicholas Sarkozy, we've got the
[3:08:25.720 --> 3:08:33.080]  Israeli leaders, we've got Joe Biden all saying massive terror attack, probably nuclear.
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:38.040]  That's what AAP is reporting today, is going to happen to test Obama.
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:39.040]  They're testing us.
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:43.400]  They're going to get tough and have bigger wars, and we can sit here and smile about it
[3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:47.160]  because we've got good cheer, and I laugh because it's so crazy.
[3:08:47.160 --> 3:08:51.800]  But God help us because they need something to start World War III, and they need a global
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:54.040]  meltdown to bring in their new world order.
[3:08:54.040 --> 3:08:56.080]  So closing comments on that text, Marks.
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:09:01.920]  Well, I'm convinced this is a prophetic scenario right out of Ezekiel 38 and 39, but it's interesting
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:04.720]  that they're the ones playing out this scenario.
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:07.080]  It's almost like they're compelled.
[3:09:07.080 --> 3:09:11.000]  They have to, they're obsessed with this framework.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:13.640]  Well, look at how they're bringing in the implantable microchips.
[3:09:13.640 --> 3:09:18.400]  Look at how they, the mark to buy and sell, I mean, they just can't help it.
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:22.120]  No, they can't help it, and that's why it's going to occur.
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:27.120]  And by the way, I want to leave you with one thing, Gog and Magog, these mysterious devil
[3:09:27.120 --> 3:09:33.400]  demons that bring the whole world into catastrophe with war in the last days.
[3:09:33.400 --> 3:09:40.520]  In London, England, at Gil Hall, where the mayor of England is, they have erected statues
[3:09:40.520 --> 3:09:46.120]  inside this, they have actual chapel or sanctuary in London, England.
[3:09:46.120 --> 3:09:49.560]  And they have secret rituals there at Gil Hall.
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:54.760]  They have erected statues of the idols, Gog and Magog.
[3:09:54.760 --> 3:09:56.240]  You say that's, that's incredible.
[3:09:56.240 --> 3:10:01.640]  They're enrollment, the warrior uniforms, and they have been placed behind the, or next
[3:10:01.640 --> 3:10:05.160]  to the altar in the chapel of Gil Hall.
[3:10:05.160 --> 3:10:11.400]  People you don't believe it, go to Google and type in Gog, Magog, London, Gil Hall.
[3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:14.640]  They actually have idol statues of Gog and Magog.
[3:10:14.640 --> 3:10:15.640]  And it's ready to go.
[3:10:15.640 --> 3:10:19.080]  And the point is here, folks, just from a secular perspective, these nuts really are
[3:10:19.080 --> 3:10:20.080]  into the occult.
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:23.760]  They really do believe all of this, elites always go insane throughout history.
[3:10:23.760 --> 3:10:30.640]  It is now happening, and folks can get a copy of your gorgeous newsletter for free each month.
[3:10:30.640 --> 3:10:32.360]  Give folks the number to call and get that.
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:46.760]  Well, folks can go to powerofproxy.com, powerofproxy.com, or call us toll-free, 1-800-234-96, 96, oh, my goodness.
[3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:47.760]  I'm the same way.
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:48.960]  I've only been there 22 years.
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:54.040]  Listen, I've got so many computer codes and house codes and, and safe codes and gun safe
[3:10:54.040 --> 3:10:55.040]  codes.
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:10:56.040]  96701.
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:10:57.040]  Give it out.
[3:10:57.040 --> 3:10:58.040]  Give it out.
[3:10:58.040 --> 3:10:59.040]  I'm the same way.
[3:10:59.040 --> 3:11:00.040]  1-800-249.
[3:11:00.040 --> 3:11:02.720]  I had to call the guys because I got here first.
[3:11:02.720 --> 3:11:07.000]  I had to call and say, what's the code to the office?
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  So much.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:09.000]  I mean, it's kind of absent minded professor.
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  As long as you remember your wife's birthday and your anniversary, you're safe, Alex.
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:14.880]  Just remember that as a young man.
[3:11:14.880 --> 3:11:15.880]  I remember those two.
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:16.880]  No, but give them the number.
[3:11:16.880 --> 3:11:17.880]  1-800-234-96701.
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:26.880]  And as for the free edition, the newsletter, give it again, powerofproxy, 1-800-234-96701.
[3:11:26.880 --> 3:11:27.880]  Okay.
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:28.880]  Hey, Jack's sad.
[3:11:28.880 --> 3:11:29.880]  Awesome having you here.
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:34.600]  Thank you much for coming in and say hi to the whole crew and to Wanda for me.
[3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:35.600]  God bless you.
[3:11:35.600 --> 3:11:37.400]  And keep up your great work here.
[3:11:37.400 --> 3:11:41.800]  And these, these people are out there that are disinformation agents, paid operatives
[3:11:41.800 --> 3:11:43.800]  of Mossad and the CIA.
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:49.120]  Hey, they're there because they're worried because you're making an impact.
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:51.760]  That's why they've targeted folks like you and me.
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:56.840]  And this audience out there has to know, this is our time, talk about what Obama said.
[3:11:56.840 --> 3:12:01.040]  This is our opportunity to tell the absolute unvornished truth.
[3:12:01.040 --> 3:12:02.040]  Thanks.
[3:12:02.040 --> 3:12:03.040]  Thanks for coming in.
[3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:04.040]  All right, my friend.
[3:12:04.040 --> 3:12:05.040]  Bye-bye.
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:06.040]  Take care.
[3:12:06.040 --> 3:12:07.040]  All right.
[3:12:07.040 --> 3:12:08.040]  I appreciate Webster terribly finishing.
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:09.040]  I got Tex on a little bit late.
[3:12:09.040 --> 3:12:10.040]  We've got him for the rest of the hour.
[3:12:10.040 --> 3:12:13.320]  He's got two books out on Obama.
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:17.160]  And we really appreciate him coming on the show with us today.
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:23.280]  Out of the gates, Webster, I have AFP, I have Reuters, I have articles that we've done that
[3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:27.960]  condense it all, Colin Powell warns of coming crisis, we don't even know about right now,
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:32.920]  terror attacks, Joe Biden saying the same thing, Webster, what are they getting us ready
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:33.920]  for?
[3:12:33.920 --> 3:12:35.800]  This is, this is extremely cryptic.
[3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:39.560]  I think Alex, thank you, thank you for having me today.
[3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:45.600]  I think we have to look at this Seattle outburst by, by Biden is absolutely fundamental, right?
[3:12:45.600 --> 3:12:48.200]  That there's a generated crisis coming.
[3:12:48.200 --> 3:12:50.000]  It's going to involve Russia.
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:54.760]  The righteousness of the U.S. position will not be immediately apparent.
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:13:00.840]  And I, I do agree, he's talking about a return to false flag operations in grand style.
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:06.480]  Now, you'll remember one of the complaints coming from the Obama forces, the Atlantic
[3:13:06.480 --> 3:13:10.960]  Monthly in particular, a guy called Andrew Sullivan, who's one of the leading Kool-Aid
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:12.640]  drinkers for Obama.
[3:13:12.640 --> 3:13:18.720]  Back in December, and this is quoted in this book of mine, Obama the Postmodern Coup,
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:22.920]  he says, right now, it would be impossible to have a false flag.
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:27.000]  I'm, I'm, I'm sort of simplifying the language to get to the reality of it, but he says right
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  now our imperialism can no longer use false flag because Bush is so hated and so discredited
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:39.680]  that if we had a false flag event and Bush came forward blaming country X, no one would
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:42.160]  believe him, virtually nobody would believe him.
[3:13:42.160 --> 3:13:47.160]  And a significant majority, a minority at least, would say, you did it yourself, Bush,
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:49.080]  you are responsible.
[3:13:49.080 --> 3:13:56.080]  So Andrew Sullivan presented Obama as a way to refurbish the credibility of the US regime
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:14:02.400]  at home and abroad so that they could then proceed to a new round of false flag operations.
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:05.840]  And indeed, this is pretty much what I've been writing about all year.
[3:14:05.840 --> 3:14:10.480]  The kinds of targets though that you've got to look at would be in the first rank places
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:16.440]  like Pakistan and Sudan, where there is a great desire for, for operations.
[3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:24.000]  But I would have to disagree with Jim Mars, this guy, Zardari, is Mr. 15% he's corrupt
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  as can be.
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:30.520]  He's one of the greatest kleptocrats of the past 20 years, but the, the problem is not
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:36.080]  even for them Zardari or the Prime Minister Gilani of Pakistan, it is the desire for the
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:39.880]  partition of Pakistan to split it up.
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:43.040]  Brzezinski writes these books, Second Chance and others.
[3:14:43.040 --> 3:14:46.520]  Well, the British have already tried to do that once.
[3:14:46.520 --> 3:14:50.400]  Well they're, they're trying again and then the whole purpose of having these bloody attacks
[3:14:50.400 --> 3:14:56.400]  by the US into Northwest Pakistan has nothing to do with this crazy mythology of bin Laden
[3:14:56.400 --> 3:14:57.400]  and all that.
[3:14:57.400 --> 3:14:58.400]  No, I understand.
[3:14:58.400 --> 3:15:01.360]  But let's go back to the incredible bombshell you just dropped on us.
[3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:05.240]  And I agree with you, Obama's their new horse, Obama's fresh.
[3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:09.560]  He can reinvigorate things, McCain would be seen as Bush 3.
[3:15:09.560 --> 3:15:15.320]  And certainly the media's totally swung into favor of Barack Obama, it wasn't clear before,
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:16.320]  it certainly is.
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:21.720]  The Wall Street money's pouring in 100 to something million in one week, I mean it's
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:25.540]  just 150 million in one week, it's all off the charts.
[3:15:25.540 --> 3:15:29.800]  They're even suddenly all over ESPN running all these shows about black athletes and all
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:32.240]  they went through and tying it into Obama.
[3:15:32.240 --> 3:15:38.160]  I mean I've never seen a full court press like this going on.
[3:15:38.160 --> 3:15:42.680]  And if there's an attack stirring up something with Russia, you know this isn't Iraq, this
[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:46.600]  isn't Afghanistan, I mean where do you see them starting a new, they already tried in
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:54.760]  Georgia with Russia to, you know, and then what type of false flag would be used to somehow
[3:15:54.760 --> 3:15:56.760]  blame Russia?
[3:15:56.760 --> 3:16:00.240]  Well the countries that would be targeted again would be in the first rank, the most
[3:16:00.240 --> 3:16:05.840]  obvious ones, Sudan, Biden in other speeches has been constantly calling for an attack
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:06.840]  on Sudan.
[3:16:06.840 --> 3:16:11.680]  It's a smaller snack to embolden him to say look how well he handled Pakistan where Obama
[3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:12.680]  said he wants to go.
[3:16:12.680 --> 3:16:18.480]  Well wait, we have to think of a broad range of possibilities, the most obvious are Sudan
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:24.360]  and Pakistan, Obama is on record demanding the bombing and actually land invasion of
[3:16:24.360 --> 3:16:25.360]  Pakistan.
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:32.040]  When Obama said in his convention stadium speech, we've got to go and get Osama bin Laden
[3:16:32.040 --> 3:16:37.600]  in the cave where he lives, that means invade Pakistan in their language, Biden has been
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:42.800]  the big guy calling for an attack on Sudan, but of course behind this is the question
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:48.560]  of Russia and China and whether they would dare to try to do something to pin terrorism
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:53.800]  on Putin or the Chinese leadership or some other combination or it might be something
[3:16:53.800 --> 3:16:59.040]  reaching into a place like Kazakhstan, you just don't know, that would give a possibility
[3:16:59.040 --> 3:17:01.040]  of delving further into the soft.
[3:17:01.040 --> 3:17:05.600]  So to give him the name as a look, he's already won something up front to then build him up
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:08.600]  as a war leader for a larger confrontation with Russia?
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:13.080]  Well, I don't know if we can be so specific about the details right now, but it's clear
[3:17:13.080 --> 3:17:17.600]  that what he's talking about, where it's not going to be apparent that we're right,
[3:17:17.600 --> 3:17:23.520]  as Biden says in this famous outburst of yesterday, it's going to be in other words
[3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:27.880]  a hard sell because I think one of the benefits of the 9-11 truth movement, the one of the
[3:17:27.880 --> 3:17:32.840]  things that you and others and I have been able to accomplish is that there is a great
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:35.560]  deal more skepticism about false flag.
[3:17:35.560 --> 3:17:40.200]  I would add under McCain, this would be virtually hopeless, it would be virtually hopeless for
[3:17:40.200 --> 3:17:44.800]  McCain to come out and say some bomb went off, country X did it, this is now the new
[3:17:44.800 --> 3:17:49.440]  enemy, let's run to attack country X, very hard to do.
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:54.600]  With Obama, there is at least a fighting chance for these imperialists to get credibility
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:18:00.520]  because Obama has this hard core of dedicated fanatical supporters, the left liberals, the
[3:18:00.520 --> 3:18:06.640]  Kool-Aid drinkers, this personality cult that is coalesced around him, again with these
[3:18:06.640 --> 3:18:11.960]  strong fascistoid overtones, they will be out there, this is what Obama is saying, we
[3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:16.520]  will need you to stand with us because it's not going to be apparent that we're right.
[3:18:16.520 --> 3:18:22.680]  The other possibility of course is sort of on the lines of Georgia, we saw Georgia under
[3:18:22.680 --> 3:18:29.040]  Sakashvili, using proxies, using proxies and in the case of Georgia it was not apparent
[3:18:29.040 --> 3:18:34.600]  that the US NATO position was right, it was rather apparent that it was wrong, that Sakashvili
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:39.880]  and Georgia were clearly the aggressors, maybe there is some other situation like this, something
[3:18:39.880 --> 3:18:45.280]  involving Ukraine or Poland, you got to remember that the real strategic heart of the world
[3:18:45.280 --> 3:18:50.560]  is not the Persian Gulf by any stretch of the imagination, it's Eastern Europe, that's
[3:18:50.560 --> 3:18:56.000]  the house hopper, McKinder, Hartland, it more or less coincides with places like Poland
[3:18:56.000 --> 3:18:57.000]  and the Ukraine.
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  It's those crossroads.
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:03.880]  If you start something there then everything is at stake immediately because the ICBMs
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:04.880]  are on both sides.
[3:19:04.880 --> 3:19:10.880]  And then suddenly you'll have the left all behind it, just like the Vietnam War and LBJ.
[3:19:10.880 --> 3:19:16.400]  That is the advantage that Obama brings, he can mobilize 200,000 German lemmings in Berlin
[3:19:16.400 --> 3:19:21.040]  and he can mobilize his Kool-Aid legions and cult following here in the United States.
[3:19:21.040 --> 3:19:25.200]  And boy are they Kool-Aid legions, every time I have you on we get threatening phone calls
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:29.000]  from people saying we need to be arrested, I mean we are in big troubles.
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:30.000]  Skip this break.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:31.000]  Phase one.
[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:34.360]  Webster, I'm going to continue on the web here in prisonplanet.tv, skipping it's too
[3:19:34.360 --> 3:19:37.720]  important, sorry I got you on late, I was finishing up with text.
[3:19:37.720 --> 3:19:38.720]  I understand.
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:42.840]  Specifically though, they're going to, where do you see false flag in there, setting off
[3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:49.520]  a nuke at a U.S. base in Pakistan, setting off a nuke in Israel?
[3:19:49.520 --> 3:19:52.840]  The entire range of possibilities and I guess we've got to go up there.
[3:19:52.840 --> 3:19:57.000]  Yeah, but Powell loves to brag, Biden loves to brag, the French President, all of them
[3:19:57.000 --> 3:20:02.280]  are saying we know what it is, we can't tell you it's going to be big and AFP says it's
[3:20:02.280 --> 3:20:03.280]  nuke.
[3:20:03.280 --> 3:20:07.800]  A nuke incident would make 9-11 insignificant nuke commission, I mean they are really pouring
[3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:10.400]  the fear on again.
[3:20:10.400 --> 3:20:15.960]  The door is now reopening and again, this all depends on getting Obama elected.
[3:20:15.960 --> 3:20:22.800]  I would remind people, back in May of 2005, we had a similar situation in Europe and France,
[3:20:22.800 --> 3:20:29.440]  specifically there was this monstrous European constitution which was pure oligarchy, elitism,
[3:20:29.440 --> 3:20:32.040]  the rule of the bankers, horrendous kind of stuff.
[3:20:32.040 --> 3:20:34.280]  Now they got shot down in France and then other...
[3:20:34.280 --> 3:20:38.320]  And it was rejected and in that situation in France, you had all of the parties and
[3:20:38.320 --> 3:20:41.880]  all of the media, we're telling everybody you've got to vote for this, if you don't
[3:20:41.880 --> 3:20:45.520]  vote for it, you're a racist, you're a neo-Nazi, and all this...
[3:20:45.520 --> 3:20:50.520]  But they have integrity in their machines, we don't have integrity, Webster.
[3:20:50.520 --> 3:20:57.640]  Well, you know, vote fraud can manufacture 10-15%, I don't know, I think these polls
[3:20:57.640 --> 3:20:58.800]  are all faked.
[3:20:58.800 --> 3:21:03.480]  That is what we know for sure, in Obama the post-modern coup, I make this lengthy comparison
[3:21:03.480 --> 3:21:09.240]  between the Obama campaign and what went on in Ukraine or Georgia or these other places,
[3:21:09.240 --> 3:21:13.360]  and fake polling is absolutely fundamental, so I think right now you have to discount
[3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:15.560]  all polling, it's all a fake.
[3:21:15.560 --> 3:21:21.840]  I see a great wave of fear and loathing against Obama, which is now overpowering the residual
[3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:24.040]  hatred of Bush, Cheney and the Republicans.
[3:21:24.040 --> 3:21:27.800]  No, no, I agree with you, but I interrupt, and finish up your analogy with the treaty
[3:21:27.800 --> 3:21:31.360]  failing three years ago and then failing again in Ireland with the Lisbon.
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:38.160]  Yeah, and the Netherlands too, in other words, when you have an attempt to ram an oligarchical
[3:21:38.160 --> 3:21:44.240]  elitist banker's monstrosity down the head of a people that I think the American people
[3:21:44.240 --> 3:21:50.000]  are still anti-fascist at heart and the desire to be free, there's always the possibility
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  that you get this kind of a backlash against international financiers and the kinds of
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:21:59.800]  things that they, like Obama, recommend.
[3:21:59.800 --> 3:22:04.240]  But I think we may be headed into something like that, in other words, a stunning defeat
[3:22:04.240 --> 3:22:09.960]  for the oligarchical power machine, just based on the fact that you think Obama is going
[3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:10.960]  to lose.
[3:22:10.960 --> 3:22:13.320]  Yeah, sure, why not?
[3:22:13.320 --> 3:22:14.760]  Of course he can lose.
[3:22:14.760 --> 3:22:18.560]  Of course he can lose, because these are all fake polls.
[3:22:18.560 --> 3:22:20.960]  I don't see any reason to believe any of these.
[3:22:20.960 --> 3:22:21.960]  We'll see what happens.
[3:22:21.960 --> 3:22:22.960]  We'll see what happens.
[3:22:22.960 --> 3:22:25.800]  The polling situation is now so fake that Gallup has two polls.
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:30.680]  They have one poll, which is traditional, and another poll, which is expanded, and expanded
[3:22:30.680 --> 3:22:33.600]  means any freak can get on there.
[3:22:33.600 --> 3:22:36.320]  They ask you a question, have you ever voted before?
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:38.280]  No, but I'm going to vote for Obama.
[3:22:38.280 --> 3:22:41.680]  Normally that would disqualify you, because it means that you're not going to vote.
[3:22:41.680 --> 3:22:45.920]  But on the expanded poll, they'll put you on there as a percentage point for Obama,
[3:22:45.920 --> 3:22:48.040]  because they want to gin up a big poll.
[3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:52.040]  Now I understand the tricks with polls, I'm sure the listeners know about that as well.
[3:22:52.040 --> 3:22:57.200]  I mean, look, it's just horrible anyway you cut it, and I mean, Pailin is completely scary.
[3:22:57.200 --> 3:22:58.200]  I don't know.
[3:22:58.200 --> 3:22:59.200]  Well, wait.
[3:22:59.200 --> 3:23:02.440]  You know, Pailin, you don't really know who Pailin is at all.
[3:23:02.440 --> 3:23:06.400]  They've surrounded her with a bunch of unemployed neocons who have been brainwashing her.
[3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:10.440]  I think she's probably better, she's a little bit like Wagner's music.
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:15.400]  She's better than it sounds, but the main thing to put to look at is structure.
[3:23:15.400 --> 3:23:20.480]  In other words, do you want a one-party regime, Obama Pelosi read?
[3:23:20.480 --> 3:23:23.080]  That is the Mussolini fascist corporate state.
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:27.520]  If you have divided government, say McCain, you'll have a dead duck with McCain, totally
[3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:36.520]  lame, and here we go back to the full audience.
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:24:06.480]  I'm controlling myself, instead of singing, I was lip-singin'
[3:24:06.480 --> 3:24:12.480]  for prisonplanet.tv, eastboundin' down, loadin' up and truckin'.
[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:18.640]  That's Aaron's favorite song.
[3:24:18.640 --> 3:24:20.240]  You know, I'm trying to laugh and have fun.
[3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:24.680]  We have the banks completely raping us, setting up a world dictatorship of the banking elite.
[3:24:24.680 --> 3:24:30.720]  You get 95, 98, depending on the poll, thousand to one phone calls into Congress against the
[3:24:30.720 --> 3:24:31.720]  bank or takeover bill.
[3:24:31.720 --> 3:24:35.720]  They still just do it.
[3:24:35.720 --> 3:24:40.920]  Well the people are waking up, but the elite is just going ahead with it all.
[3:24:40.920 --> 3:24:45.200]  You got Colin Powell and Biden, all of them running around Fairmongering, saying everybody
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:49.160]  for massive events that will test us.
[3:24:49.160 --> 3:24:50.240]  It's Webster Tarbley.
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:52.720]  Where do you see all this going, my friend?
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:59.680]  Well, the main thing is to come out of this not having a one-party totalitarian state.
[3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:04.320]  In other words, the worst possible outcome is Obama, Pelosi, and Reid.
[3:25:04.320 --> 3:25:07.120]  That is the fascist corporate state.
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:13.440]  That will in particular trample on the First Amendment and free speech in a way that Bush
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:15.320]  and Cheney never dreamed of.
[3:25:15.320 --> 3:25:20.800]  And they will do this with the help of their mermidans, right, this fanatical cult following,
[3:25:20.800 --> 3:25:25.600]  the Squadristi or Sturmabteilung or whatever you want to call it, that they have going
[3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:30.920]  both on the internet and also in the streets and in the gutters.
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:34.560]  The minimum to come out of this with, I would say, is divided government.
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:38.920]  In other words, the president of one party and the Congress of another party.
[3:25:38.920 --> 3:25:40.920]  And let's have trench warfare between them.
[3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:42.600]  Let's have partisan gridlock.
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:44.040]  Let's have paralysis.
[3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:49.760]  Let's have the most extreme form of confrontation because the issues are huge.
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:50.920]  There is a depression now.
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:56.400]  We are descending into a new world economic and financial depression of tremendous severity.
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:25:58.080]  McCain has no answers.
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:01.080]  The Democratic side actually do have answers.
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:03.120]  Their answer is the fascist corporate state.
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:11.440]  We had this guy Kramer go on CNBC last Thursday saying that they want more bailouts, more
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:17.240]  trillions in effect for Wall Street and the derivatives, and Kramer even said under questioning,
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:22.960]  he wants to loot the Social Security Trust fund of $100 billion for starters to try to
[3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:25.280]  shore up toxic derivative paper.
[3:26:25.280 --> 3:26:27.280]  Now, this is impossible.
[3:26:27.280 --> 3:26:32.200]  It's a futile gesture because the derivatives are a quadrillion, $100 billion is gone in
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:33.600]  a matter of seconds.
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:34.960]  But this is what they would do.
[3:26:34.960 --> 3:26:39.280]  In order for them to do that in the full scope of what they have in mind, they've got to
[3:26:39.280 --> 3:26:40.720]  have the one party state.
[3:26:40.720 --> 3:26:42.120]  They've got to have Pelosi.
[3:26:42.120 --> 3:26:43.120]  I agree.
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:49.720]  But, Webster, how obvious is it that Obama's bad when you have the big Republican frontman
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:55.720]  who shook the vial of anthrax and said they had nukes to the UN and now he's the darling
[3:26:55.720 --> 3:27:00.320]  of the left and he says Obama's good and he said on Meet the Press it's going to be this
[3:27:00.320 --> 3:27:08.440]  transformative person of Obama and he went on to say because he knows what to do with
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:12.200]  the banker bailouts and McCain didn't want to do it.
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:16.360]  So, he said, my goodness, we're getting an endorsement from the good old boy club right
[3:27:16.360 --> 3:27:17.360]  there.
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:19.440]  Well, Colin Powell's an interesting story.
[3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:25.920]  I think the thing that motivates him most of all is his near-do-well, wasteful son, Michael
[3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:26.920]  Powell.
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:31.920]  Colin Powell's an nepotist and I think when he signed on as Secretary of State with Bush
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:38.560]  Cheney, he said, I'll take this job but I want a plum post for my idiot son, Michael
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:39.800]  Powell.
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:44.120]  And that was the Federal Communications Commission and you'll remember Michael Powell was on
[3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:49.160]  the one side a servant of the cartels and the monopolies and the oligopolies of the
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:50.760]  communications industry.
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:56.120]  On the other side, he had this vendetta against Howard Stern, clashed with Howard Stern and
[3:27:56.120 --> 3:28:01.840]  Howard Stern had the presence of mind to say, look, you're only here because of your father.
[3:28:01.840 --> 3:28:06.480]  You have no talent, you're simply a hanger on and you got your job because of your famous
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:07.480]  father.
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:12.960]  Now, Colin Powell now has to take care of Michael Powell for another 10 years in another
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:18.360]  administration, this time with Democrats, so he's trying to fix up his son.
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:21.800]  It parallel to this very interesting distant mirror.
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:26.960]  Field Marshal von Hindenburg, another soldier who became a politician, was of course the
[3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:32.800]  main German commander in World War I, then became, after 1925, the President of Germany,
[3:28:32.800 --> 3:28:35.200]  the President of the Weimar Republic.
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:42.160]  Up until 1933, Hindenburg had always said, I will never let this Bohemian corporal Hitler
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:44.040]  ever become President of Germany.
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:45.400]  This is unspeakable.
[3:28:45.400 --> 3:28:46.720]  The guy is a gutter snipe.
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:52.800]  Eventually, though, it turned out, his son, Oscar von Hindenburg, had gambling debts and
[3:28:52.800 --> 3:28:58.080]  problems with embezzlement and possible criminal charges, and at that point, the Nazis pulled
[3:28:58.080 --> 3:29:01.520]  that chain and Hindenburg caved in as his horse.
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:06.960]  Stay there, got a break, Webster, and it's the same thing with a lower level with Oliver
[3:29:06.960 --> 3:29:12.080]  Stone making these government worship films like W. I mean, he's got all these drug convictions
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:14.640]  and it's facing President if he doesn't sell out.
[3:29:14.640 --> 3:29:19.840]  Webster Tarbley's our guest, stay with us.
[3:29:19.840 --> 3:29:26.400]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:26.400 --> 3:29:30.760]  All right, bring me back to Webster and I'm skipping everything, this is too important.
[3:29:30.760 --> 3:29:33.560]  Webster, continue, you know, I hope you're right.
[3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:38.280]  It's disgusting and sick to say, I'm not even saying I'm voting for him, but there's so
[3:29:38.280 --> 3:29:42.720]  much election fraud, but I mean, voting one, one miserable little vote, no, I just can't
[3:29:42.720 --> 3:29:44.720]  bring myself for McCain.
[3:29:44.720 --> 3:29:48.040]  But you can move millions of votes, Alex, with your voice can move millions of votes
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:53.080]  and I think there are three considerations, stop Obama at all costs, punish those who
[3:29:53.080 --> 3:29:56.960]  supported the bailout, and come out of it with divided government.
[3:29:56.960 --> 3:30:02.680]  Now I understand that and I agree with you, it's just, I know Obama is vehemently, like
[3:30:02.680 --> 3:30:07.400]  no president ever, if he becomes an anti-gun, he says he's going to ban most guns, it's
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:12.080]  incredible, I mean, most rivals, 308, 223, everything, anything that, quote, it could
[3:30:12.080 --> 3:30:19.360]  be used in the military, he is for total open borders, he is for corporate fascism
[3:30:19.360 --> 3:30:24.600]  and he's got all these well-meaning idiots, just like all these well-meaning idiots supported
[3:30:24.600 --> 3:30:28.240]  George Bush over Bill Clinton, not knowing they're all puppets, but I agree, I mean,
[3:30:28.240 --> 3:30:36.400]  I've never seen such corporate support and the media spinning against, everywhere but
[3:30:36.400 --> 3:30:44.000]  Fox, against John McCain, and Fox is so cartoonish, no one takes it serious, and I agree that
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:48.680]  McCain will be absolutely a dead duck as president and won't be able to get anything
[3:30:48.680 --> 3:30:54.040]  done and will be hated, and then things will kind of just fall apart, versus Obama, I mean,
[3:30:54.040 --> 3:31:00.760]  he really wants to be the world ruler and he's got the backing to do it, but you really
[3:31:00.760 --> 3:31:02.920]  think that he can be beaten?
[3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:07.800]  Absolutely he can, because I think all of these polls are fake, I don't see any groundswell
[3:31:07.800 --> 3:31:12.640]  for Obama, I see fear and loathing, the other thing is let's go through who's fighting,
[3:31:12.640 --> 3:31:16.800]  Phil Berg is fighting with that lawsuit in Philadelphia, he just filed new court papers
[3:31:16.800 --> 3:31:21.840]  yesterday, these are now admissions and it says to the Obama campaign, if you don't respond
[3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:26.960]  to these statements within 30 days, you have admitted to them and out you go, now 30 days
[3:31:26.960 --> 3:31:31.040]  unfortunately is no longer enough, but that's another move by Berg and that may get him
[3:31:31.040 --> 3:31:37.480]  on to one of these cable TV networks, Larry Sinclair is still fighting, he's still touring,
[3:31:37.480 --> 3:31:43.400]  we've got a group called the Real Democrats who are organizing Democrats for McCain going
[3:31:43.400 --> 3:31:50.400]  into Pennsylvania and Virginia, and then you've got these wild cards, right?
[3:31:50.400 --> 3:31:56.600]  Sometime around now there's this famous tape by Michelle Obama who appears together with
[3:31:56.600 --> 3:32:03.360]  Madame Farrakhan and makes a racist tirade about a whole series of themes, this has now
[3:32:03.360 --> 3:32:09.120]  been expected, I mean today was a day when some people thought it would come out, I would
[3:32:09.120 --> 3:32:13.840]  say it's more likely in about a week, I would say Tuesday, Wednesday of next week, a more
[3:32:13.840 --> 3:32:14.840]  specific day.
[3:32:14.840 --> 3:32:15.840]  So it can have maximum effect?
[3:32:15.840 --> 3:32:20.720]  Yeah, maximum effect and you can't organize a counteroffensive against it because there's
[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:26.000]  not enough time, there are various types, there's also this question of the African
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:31.720]  press international interview with Michelle Obama which is also a, hold on we're going
[3:32:31.720 --> 3:32:53.640]  back to the full audience, going back to the full audience, here we go, what is that horrified
[3:32:53.640 --> 3:33:09.360]  look on your face out there Paul, oh okay, everything good, oh I think the TV guys down
[3:33:09.360 --> 3:33:20.480]  here want you to boost the audio John, crank it up, blow my air drums out, hey, you know
[3:33:20.480 --> 3:33:25.440]  what we do here, the network puts it up on the satellite uplinks, they're in Minnesota,
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:31.000]  we're in Austin, Texas and we send out our own feeds here and PrisonPlanet.TV feeds,
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  so it is quite a setup here and I appreciate John Harmon up in Minnesota, Ted Anderson,
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:43.600]  the whole crew up there and I appreciate Paul Hartman and everybody else that is down here
[3:33:43.600 --> 3:33:52.360]  in my office, Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson, Trey Kincaid, aka Eddie Bear and his dog is
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:56.120]  known as Pickle Bear, the Chihuahua and again it's in times like these when things are
[3:33:56.120 --> 3:34:00.600]  so dark that I try to have a little bit of fun but very thankful for all our M&F affiliates,
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:06.160]  global story affiliates, satellite affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners, everybody and
[3:34:06.160 --> 3:34:10.560]  my family and the good Lord above, okay well I'm sure I'm going to try to just sit back
[3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:14.080]  for the rest of the broadcast and try to give you the floor, I brought up a lot of points,
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:18.640]  you know, any way you slice it going into depression, any way you slice it, police state
[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:23.120]  grid, you have the same elite that backs Obama, backs McCain, they're in power regardless
[3:34:23.120 --> 3:34:27.040]  with either one of these guys, I agree they get more traction with the front man, the
[3:34:27.040 --> 3:34:31.840]  new birdcage liner, who's more clean than you know on the surface than the kind of half
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:38.480]  used birdcage liner of McCain with his Bush Association but what I see is the disgusting
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:43.840]  corporate foundation left, the Noam Chomsky's you know who sits there in his office with
[3:34:43.840 --> 3:34:47.880]  a million books behind him with that image of you know the genius of earth with this
[3:34:47.880 --> 3:34:57.440]  boiled down pap for children you know saying basically vote for Obama you know not because
[3:34:57.440 --> 3:35:02.520]  he's good because he's better than McCain and he's not stupid, he knows it means more
[3:35:02.520 --> 3:35:09.320]  warmongering, more control and so just to see the foundation left, they are just such
[3:35:09.320 --> 3:35:14.440]  a nasty little crew of ne'er-do-wells, can you comment on him and others and then get
[3:35:14.440 --> 3:35:16.280]  into whatever you like?
[3:35:16.280 --> 3:35:22.040]  I think they were extremely important during the phase of the Democratic primaries, the
[3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:30.440]  left liberal foundation funded gatekeeper or border guard left wing was used by Obama to
[3:35:30.440 --> 3:35:36.880]  overwhelm the Clinton machine and get the nomination, now since then a lot of these people have
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:41.640]  actually become disillusioned with Obama because of his betrayal, I mean take this
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:47.880]  Pfizer question at the wiretapping, Obama had pledged that he would filibuster any attempt
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:53.880]  to renew the Pfizer shenanigans of Bush and to give retroactive immunity to the telecom
[3:35:53.880 --> 3:35:59.000]  companies and instead Obama voted for it, he had said that he was against free trade
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:04.320]  and NAFTA or suggested he might be and then he actively embraced it and then even on the
[3:36:04.320 --> 3:36:09.320]  Iraq war he said I'll have a timetable and then his advisor said no no he's not going
[3:36:09.320 --> 3:36:16.200]  to be bound by any silly campaign promises, so some of these left liberals are in crisis
[3:36:16.200 --> 3:36:22.040]  but there are a lot of them that still remain on board, surely a night of the long knives
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:28.520]  is coming for them and I think if you get back to this remarkable statement by Biden
[3:36:28.520 --> 3:36:34.440]  in Seattle because he not only says apparently that they're going to go back to false flags
[3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:40.560]  to get the new enemies list established, he also talks about a systemic economic crisis
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:47.040]  where the measures that Obama will introduce will be so unpopular that the Obama regime
[3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:51.840]  will collapse in the polls, people who are going to say wait a minute what decisions
[3:36:51.840 --> 3:36:58.600]  are you making Obama and why are the polls so low and Biden has to appeal to them say
[3:36:58.600 --> 3:37:04.600]  you hard core of Richie Liedes because he's in Seattle, he might have Bill and Melinda
[3:37:04.600 --> 3:37:10.600]  Gates there for all we know or people of this type like Balmer, people who run Microsoft
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:15.120]  sitting there for Biden and he says we will have to make economic decisions that are going
[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:20.040]  to be extremely unpopular and if they're popular they won't be sound so we want them
[3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:25.040]  to be sound they're going to be extremely unpopular, this is an amazing document in
[3:37:25.040 --> 3:37:30.640]  other words I would urge people organized now for the next two weeks on the basis of
[3:37:30.640 --> 3:37:36.760]  the fact we have got the printout of the Obama regime, he's going to attack his own base
[3:37:36.760 --> 3:37:41.160]  including these left liberals, he's going to betray his own base, he's going to become
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:45.880]  unbelievably unpopular, this was something that I had in mind when I did Obama the postmodern
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:51.040]  coup, back in the springtime I went back and wrote a 40 page short history of the Carter
[3:37:51.040 --> 3:37:57.240]  regime, the last trilateral puppet with a real catastrophic presidency with Volcker
[3:37:57.240 --> 3:38:04.680]  and Brzezinski and what you see in Carter is that he began collapsing right after the
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:09.360]  hundred days were over, in other words three months into his first term, his only term
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:15.840]  he began collapsing and I said to myself well it took Carter about 12 months to become completely
[3:38:15.840 --> 3:38:21.680]  unpopular and basically hated, how long will it take for Obama, well certainly less than
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:28.720]  12 months because of the increased crisis that we face today, the situation much further
[3:38:28.720 --> 3:38:37.800]  far gone than with Carter, so that is what Obama, what Biden has now told us, Biden is
[3:38:37.800 --> 3:38:44.240]  a guy, he's got a mind like a rag bag, he deals in fragments of thought, he spews them
[3:38:44.240 --> 3:38:50.760]  out, he can't shut up, what he's obviously done is told some briefings that he's had,
[3:38:50.760 --> 3:38:57.200]  notice that the two campaigns, McCain and Obama-Biden were briefed last week at the
[3:38:57.200 --> 3:39:03.320]  White House, now a White House briefing these days does not mean a Bush-Cheney-Neocon briefing,
[3:39:03.320 --> 3:39:08.360]  it means a principal committee briefing, it means something that according to the policies
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:16.280]  expressed by Rice, by Robert Gates, the Brzezinski stooge from the Carter years, Admiral Mullen
[3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:20.560]  and of course Paulson, the most powerful of them all right now, the guy who actually runs
[3:39:20.560 --> 3:39:27.960]  the government in the economic and domestic policy, so what Biden seems to be regurgitating
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:32.880]  here is what he got out of that briefing that they got from the White House, which is that
[3:39:32.880 --> 3:39:39.400]  if Obama gets in the rogue network in the government, the establishment, the permanent
[3:39:39.400 --> 3:39:44.360]  Washington bureaucracy, this network that goes through there anyway, he's going to try
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:51.000]  to start something, again, it's time to say we don't want to go down that road, let's
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  reject Obama and if that means McCain, it's going to be so much harder to organize this
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:01.360]  stuff, you can't get anybody in Europe with McCain, you can't get European troops and
[3:40:01.360 --> 3:40:05.240]  European money, you can't get them with McCain any more than you could get them with Bush.
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:08.960]  Well I'm sure I want to focus in on what you were just saying because it's important
[3:40:08.960 --> 3:40:12.760]  and I want this to go over people's heads because they're halfway listening and taking
[3:40:12.760 --> 3:40:16.600]  groceries out of the car, riding somebody a ticket or whatever people are out there
[3:40:16.600 --> 3:40:24.680]  doing listening, they need a crisis, they need a military crisis so they can flex muscles
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:30.120]  and popularize him as a tough guy to get people to rally around the government and say we'll
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:34.840]  do whatever the commander-in-chief says in these tough economic times because the darn
[3:40:34.840 --> 3:40:41.680]  Ruskies or the Pakistanis, you know, they did something wrong and we've got the elite
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:47.360]  signaling that they're going to do something big for all those in the know, kind of like
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:55.080]  we had one of the CFR policy makers, Gary Hart, write a letter to Ahmed Denizide saying look,
[3:40:55.080 --> 3:40:59.280]  you better do what we say or we'll stage a terror attack on you pal and we're not above
[3:40:59.280 --> 3:41:01.000]  doing it.
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:07.440]  So that's a multifaceted threat because for the public, you know, they know the public's
[3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:13.400]  dumbed down, stuck on their thumbs watching football and so they openly discuss and thinly
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:15.320]  veiled discussions.
[3:41:15.320 --> 3:41:21.360]  The reason I brought up, so I want you to elaborate on that, A, and then B, the reason
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:28.120]  I brought up Noam Chomsky, he endorsed two days ago Barack Obama and I'm just so tired
[3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:34.200]  of because somebody talks with a lisp and says they're intellectual, we fall down like
[3:41:34.200 --> 3:41:35.480]  they're an idol at their feet.
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:39.360]  I mean, I don't claim to be an intellectual, but I mean, I have guests on who are light
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:43.160]  years, you know, ahead of this guy and really talking about real issues.
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:46.680]  I'm just, I'm so tired of the phony right and the phony left, it makes me want to throw
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:47.680]  up.
[3:41:47.680 --> 3:41:53.040]  Well, again, how can we, how can we express this at the polls because now there is this
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:42:00.040]  election, given the fact that we have the media whores outdoing themselves in unbelievable
[3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:09.600]  excesses of Obama-philia and groupie behavior, just the idea of defeating the media's favorite
[3:42:09.600 --> 3:42:11.800]  candidate would be a liberating experience.
[3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:16.880]  The American people, if they could pull themselves together and defeat Obama, that would be a
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:21.880]  crushing defeat to this mighty warlitzer that we've had going for all these years.
[3:42:21.880 --> 3:42:25.560]  That's right, because they're running a corpse against him, like Bob Dole against Clinton
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:29.280]  in 96, meaning for McCain to lose.
[3:42:29.280 --> 3:42:32.960]  And if we put the corpse in office instead of him, they're going to have a lot of trouble
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:34.440]  putting perfume on that pig.
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:39.440]  And again, you don't get the 200,000 German lemmings with McCain, you don't get anything
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:44.360]  with McCain, you don't get a facelift for imperialism, you get no credibility in Europe,
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:48.720]  no money, no troops, can't send any more people to Afghanistan.
[3:42:48.720 --> 3:42:53.520]  It just puts the whole imperialist operation in a much weaker condition, and again, think
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:43:00.680]  about this stuff about the economic policies, right, that he's saying, Biden says, I guarantee
[3:43:00.680 --> 3:43:06.840]  you, I promise you, in one year, we will be a collapsed regime, in other words, we will
[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:10.880]  have extreme unpopularity because of our economic decisions.
[3:43:10.880 --> 3:43:15.280]  I think it's what he's talking about even more, maybe, than the, uh, than the...
[3:43:15.280 --> 3:43:19.760]  Why can't Biden help it, he just loves to talk about what's really going on.
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:23.440]  He doesn't, he also, he's not quite aware of what he's talking to, in other words,
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:27.200]  I think he's got, he's got people, again, like Bill and Melinda Gates, or this guy
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:33.000]  Ballmer, or others, he's got the money bags people, it's a crowd that delivered about
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:40.280]  a million dollars in two meetings in the Sheraton in Seattle, Washington.
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:45.760]  So he thinks he's, it's a moment, a little bit like Obama talking to the San Francisco
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:50.280]  group with somebody like, uh, Gordon Getty, right, and he goes to...
[3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:54.920]  He thinks he's in a comfortable inner, inner sanctum, that they're playing the old game
[3:43:54.920 --> 3:43:58.200]  at 10, 20 years ago, when the media knew to shut up.
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:44:04.080]  The, the bitter clinger, right, the people who have no jobs and cling to guns, religion,
[3:44:04.080 --> 3:44:09.760]  and anti-trade, anti-trade, above all, uh, that, that has been, I think, the, the insight
[3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:14.320]  that a lot of people have into Obama comes from that particular, uh, tyrant, I think
[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:19.040]  Obama has done the same thing here, but also notice, he's appealing to them saying, we
[3:44:19.040 --> 3:44:26.880]  will require a hard core of fanatical determined support that will support us no matter what,
[3:44:26.880 --> 3:44:31.200]  and that is, again, an advantage of, of Obama, and Obama has a following, again, I'd call
[3:44:31.200 --> 3:44:33.240]  it basically verging on fascism.
[3:44:33.240 --> 3:44:37.560]  Well, you've been saying that for like, 10, 11 months, and I was like, eh, now I've run
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:38.560]  into him.
[3:44:38.560 --> 3:44:43.680]  I mean, people I've known for years are like zombies angry with me, and, uh, and I, I'm
[3:44:43.680 --> 3:44:47.480]  just like, man, what has come over years, just like the Bush supporters, we just cover
[3:44:47.480 --> 3:44:48.480]  the facts here.
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:49.480]  Uh, Webster-
[3:44:49.480 --> 3:44:52.400]  But notice with McCain, McCain has no base of support, really.
[3:44:52.400 --> 3:44:56.160]  He has, there's no group that is absolutely devoted to McCain.
[3:44:56.160 --> 3:44:57.160]  Nobody.
[3:44:57.160 --> 3:44:58.160]  Webster, what is the elite-
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:44:59.160]  That's another advantage.
[3:44:59.160 --> 3:45:00.160]  Yeah.
[3:45:00.160 --> 3:45:01.160]  Well, I understand.
[3:45:01.160 --> 3:45:05.840]  Uh, and the listeners, too, we, we, uh, Webster, what is the elite gonna do as it becomes
[3:45:05.840 --> 3:45:10.800]  even more apparent, more clear, that you have the military industrial complex, the shadow
[3:45:10.800 --> 3:45:16.200]  government run by Wall Street, the internationalists, the Anglo-American aristocracy, uh, oligarchs
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:20.360]  running everything, and everything they do is unpopular.
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:22.120]  Every issue they're on is unpopular.
[3:45:22.120 --> 3:45:28.320]  I mean, everything they do is 70 to 95 points, the bailout, you know, 99 points, 1,000 to
[3:45:28.320 --> 3:45:34.280]  one calls, or more, against what the people want, I mean, it's becoming so obvious down
[3:45:34.280 --> 3:45:36.440]  the road, regardless of who gets elected.
[3:45:36.440 --> 3:45:38.480]  How do you see this all playing out?
[3:45:38.480 --> 3:45:41.240]  I mean, here's a better way.
[3:45:41.240 --> 3:45:43.720]  With a McCain, how does it play out in 60 seconds?
[3:45:43.720 --> 3:45:45.880]  With an Obama, how does it play out in 60 seconds?
[3:45:45.880 --> 3:45:50.880]  Well, with McCain, I think it leads to an abortive defeat of the, uh, of the ruling
[3:45:50.880 --> 3:45:51.880]  elite.
[3:45:51.880 --> 3:45:57.280]  In other words, it leads to a period of prolonged political ferment and indecision and conflict
[3:45:57.280 --> 3:46:01.560]  and partisan gridlock and so forth, out of which a real alternative might come.
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:06.320]  It would be our job to intervene in that and try to bring out of it a viable alternative,
[3:46:06.320 --> 3:46:10.280]  where we'd have to have an economic program and a whole series of other things.
[3:46:10.280 --> 3:46:16.600]  The case of Obama, remember, the genius of fascism is you've got to destroy the institutional
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:18.200]  basis of resistance.
[3:46:18.200 --> 3:46:22.240]  You've got to destroy the Democratic Party, destroy the trade union movement.
[3:46:22.240 --> 3:46:27.360]  You do that, in part, by discrediting them, by making them the bringers of austerity,
[3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:34.240]  the savage, brutal, crushing economic regime, right, forced labor, all of this kind of stuff.
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:36.640]  You can destroy other institutions, too.
[3:46:36.640 --> 3:46:43.160]  The goal is to have a totally atomized population where you have what amounts then to a totalitarian
[3:46:43.160 --> 3:46:47.280]  police state confronting people who have no organizations.
[3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:51.960]  Right now, there's a tremendous backlash against the financiers, against the bailout, and it's
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:46:55.280]  looking for an institution that would express that.
[3:46:55.280 --> 3:46:57.480]  It could be all sorts of institutions.
[3:46:57.480 --> 3:47:00.000]  I mean, it turned out to be Joe the Plumber, right?
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:05.080]  This one guy comes out, and it expresses the fact that he doesn't like what Obama wants
[3:47:05.080 --> 3:47:09.200]  to do to him economically, and all of a sudden, this guy becomes a hero.
[3:47:09.200 --> 3:47:15.560]  If you had an organized institution, a party, a union, a club, I don't know what.
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:18.440]  It could be all sorts of things that are impossible to predict.
[3:47:18.440 --> 3:47:22.280]  That would then become the focus of leading an opposition.
[3:47:22.280 --> 3:47:27.560]  But the goal of Obama and his crew is to fix it so that all of these institutions will
[3:47:27.560 --> 3:47:33.480]  be so destroyed and so wrecked that they'll be unviable, and nobody can turn to them.
[3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:37.920]  So it's just total atomized population, and by atomize, you mean balkanized down to the
[3:47:37.920 --> 3:47:38.920]  smallest level.
[3:47:38.920 --> 3:47:45.640]  In other words, that the regime would confront simply individuals with no serious organizations
[3:47:45.640 --> 3:47:48.080]  of any kind, above all, not unions, and not-
[3:47:48.080 --> 3:47:52.720]  Well, you know what's going to happen, I mean, Obama is going to come after and try to ban
[3:47:52.720 --> 3:47:54.400]  a large portion.
[3:47:54.400 --> 3:47:59.800]  He said 2-3-3-0-8, he's going to try it, he's going to bring in a carbon tax.
[3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:05.920]  Let's talk about the enforced austerity, because, you know, I mean, I get so divorced from left
[3:48:05.920 --> 3:48:09.920]  and right, so divorced from both puppets that I kind of intellectually have my nose in the
[3:48:09.920 --> 3:48:13.440]  air and just wouldn't look at either one of them.
[3:48:13.440 --> 3:48:17.200]  And I got to tell you, Webster, you're right, I looked at Obama, and he couldn't be worse.
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:22.040]  I mean, this guy is so horrible, and I'm actually ashamed that I didn't look at him closely
[3:48:22.040 --> 3:48:23.040]  earlier.
[3:48:23.040 --> 3:48:26.280]  I'm not omnipresent, and some people seem to think, folks, he's a regular guy, and
[3:48:26.280 --> 3:48:28.680]  I can't believe how bad he is.
[3:48:28.680 --> 3:48:34.840]  I mean, it is, and he's supposedly liberal, he's black, it's totally fool's people.
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:35.840]  They have no idea.
[3:48:35.840 --> 3:48:40.680]  This is a Hitler, and people just can't see it because he's got a black skin.
[3:48:40.680 --> 3:48:46.240]  Yes, and that's one of the reasons that his career has been fostered, was to prepare him.
[3:48:46.240 --> 3:48:51.840]  I think over as many as 25 years, he has been indoctrinated and fostered and prepared for
[3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:52.840]  this.
[3:48:52.840 --> 3:48:53.840]  So tell us about the austerity.
[3:48:53.840 --> 3:48:54.840]  Tell us.
[3:48:54.840 --> 3:48:59.800]  Yeah, you have to remember that whatever he says is the nearest hint of what he will do,
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:00.800]  and that's what a...
[3:49:00.800 --> 3:49:05.640]  So when he says a million-man youth brigade arresting citizens and squads of tattletale
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:07.560]  children, it's worse.
[3:49:07.560 --> 3:49:08.560]  That's just for openers.
[3:49:08.560 --> 3:49:14.640]  In other words, if he says I'll cut 10% off your standard of living, he means 50 or 60%
[3:49:14.640 --> 3:49:16.920]  or whatever he can get.
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:18.280]  Think back to Carter.
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:22.680]  Carter campaign saying we have to do something about the problem of unemployment.
[3:49:22.680 --> 3:49:23.680]  We need jobs.
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:28.600]  As soon as he got elected, he completely reversed his field, and he said the main problem now
[3:49:28.600 --> 3:49:30.560]  is inflation.
[3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:34.360]  This led to Volcker at the Federal Reserve, the 22% prime rate.
[3:49:34.360 --> 3:49:38.520]  The destruction of the entire U.S. industrial base goes back to that.
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:41.440]  The other side of Carter was to say the energy crisis.
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:45.680]  We've got to have energy austerity, the moral equivalent of war.
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:47.720]  You guys have the malaise.
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:51.880]  Notice also, similar things between Obama and Carter.
[3:49:51.880 --> 3:49:56.520]  They want to blame the American people for their own incompetence.
[3:49:56.520 --> 3:50:03.760]  That was the famous malaise speech by Jimmy Carter in July of 1979, when his entire government
[3:50:03.760 --> 3:50:05.240]  basically imploded.
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:11.560]  So whatever Obama says he will do, he will do much, much worse, and that will be this
[3:50:11.560 --> 3:50:19.320]  carbon austerity, tax increases, service cuts, forced labor, forced volunteer work, and all
[3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:20.320]  the rest of it.
[3:50:20.320 --> 3:50:25.640]  Yeah, the National Compulsory Service Act, which they say isn't a draft, but it is.
[3:50:25.640 --> 3:50:27.320]  Webster, let's continue.
[3:50:27.320 --> 3:50:29.280]  Final segment is coming up here.
[3:50:29.280 --> 3:50:30.280]  Ionic zone.
[3:50:30.280 --> 3:50:31.280]  Let me go ahead and go back to Webster.
[3:50:31.280 --> 3:50:33.760]  I don't want to waste any time.
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:37.240]  Webster, I try not to get depressed when these shows.
[3:50:37.240 --> 3:50:42.240]  I know it's positive to admit the facts and really go over them.
[3:50:42.240 --> 3:50:47.200]  I just can't stand the Obamanoids, because I know they're a well-meaning idiot, just
[3:50:47.200 --> 3:50:50.840]  like mainline Republicans, and I don't understand why people are so dumb.
[3:50:50.840 --> 3:50:52.640]  I don't think of myself as that smart.
[3:50:52.640 --> 3:50:54.200]  I think of myself as average.
[3:50:54.200 --> 3:50:57.360]  How can the people not understand this or not see this?
[3:50:57.360 --> 3:50:58.760]  I just don't understand it.
[3:50:58.760 --> 3:50:59.760]  It's so obvious.
[3:50:59.760 --> 3:51:06.280]  People are blinded by hatred of Bush and Cheney, and you have to think back to the tremendous
[3:51:06.280 --> 3:51:09.280]  damage done by Bush and Cheney to this society.
[3:51:09.280 --> 3:51:13.360]  We have to realize it's really just the elite agenda continuing, which Obama's going to
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:16.800]  throw himself on the sword for the elites as well.
[3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:20.320]  Well, I mean, he is the vehicle of what they do.
[3:51:20.320 --> 3:51:25.320]  See, if you go through Bush and Cheney and you don't understand what's going on, you
[3:51:25.320 --> 3:51:31.280]  get out of this, the desire to be a leftist and the desire to create a left-wing alternative.
[3:51:31.280 --> 3:51:32.280]  Aha!
[3:51:32.280 --> 3:51:39.320]  Brzezinski, schooled in the service of Hegel and this Alfred Weber and Carl Riecker.
[3:51:39.320 --> 3:51:48.160]  He has a left-wing alternative for you now, an abortive phase of left cover, left sloganeering,
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:53.720]  Obama the left-wing messiah, and there's just such a hatred and resentment.
[3:51:53.720 --> 3:51:59.720]  I'm sure you know, I'm sure you know that they're now actually in major newspapers
[3:51:59.720 --> 3:52:01.520]  calling him Jesus.
[3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:08.800]  Yeah, look, the other thing is that the decomposition and collapse of society has gone much further.
[3:52:08.800 --> 3:52:13.720]  A lot of people who looked at the Mussolini movement or the German one later would say,
[3:52:13.720 --> 3:52:20.240]  this is the crazed petty bourgeoisie driven wild by the crisis, in other words, people
[3:52:20.240 --> 3:52:25.000]  who have lost everything and the stock market collapsed and that's coming now.
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:31.680]  People who feel threatened in every detail of their life, who live in fear of the financial
[3:52:31.680 --> 3:52:37.760]  crisis and they're looking for some kind of charismatic figure who promises to take
[3:52:37.760 --> 3:52:42.080]  them out of despair and into hope, and this is clearly Obama.
[3:52:42.080 --> 3:52:47.360]  And then national rebirth, right, that they've thought of, they've been ashamed of their
[3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:53.880]  country and they've been so full of resentment against their own government, but Obama promises
[3:52:53.880 --> 3:52:58.000]  somehow that in a magic process, a little bit like Carter, he'll give you a government
[3:52:58.000 --> 3:53:02.480]  as good and as decent and as hardworking as you think you are.
[3:53:02.480 --> 3:53:08.560]  So, this is essentially, it's the desire to deliver some version of paradise on earth,
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:09.560]  right, many people have.
[3:53:09.560 --> 3:53:10.560]  No, they love it.
[3:53:10.560 --> 3:53:14.640]  That's what you get from this new Utopia film that mixes a 9-11 truth in the monetary
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:15.640]  system.
[3:53:15.640 --> 3:53:20.440]  It's accurate, but then it offers this Valhalla of Angelen withering away of the state and
[3:53:20.440 --> 3:53:22.200]  no one working in heaven.
[3:53:22.200 --> 3:53:25.320]  And I mean, people love just simple bull.
[3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:28.640]  I want to comment on that in the final segment, Webster, and talk about...
[3:53:28.640 --> 3:53:29.640]  You need to be duped.
[3:53:29.640 --> 3:53:31.640]  The desire to be duped.
[3:53:31.640 --> 3:53:32.640]  Yeah, stay there.
[3:53:32.640 --> 3:53:33.640]  Let's talk about it.
[3:53:33.640 --> 3:53:34.640]  Here we go.
[3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:43.520]  Okay, that's Willie Nelson, you hear there in the music.
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:46.320]  He's scheduled to be on the show tomorrow, talk about a host of issues, he'll want to
[3:53:46.320 --> 3:53:47.320]  join us for that.
[3:53:47.320 --> 3:53:52.240]  We also have Naomi Wolfon, we'll have some serious questions for her, and another big
[3:53:52.240 --> 3:53:57.600]  guest who predicted all this oil information, and then of course it'll be Lindsay Williams,
[3:53:57.600 --> 3:53:59.240]  huge show tomorrow.
[3:53:59.240 --> 3:54:05.280]  Before I go back to Webster Tarpley, I want to tell you about a few sponsors.
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:08.800]  Well, number one, the books and video is sold at infowars.com.
[3:54:08.800 --> 3:54:12.200]  Makes so much of this show possible.
[3:54:12.200 --> 3:54:16.480]  Another one is newvitality, newvitality.com.
[3:54:16.480 --> 3:54:21.240]  You can call and get the Aloe Body Cleanse, Aloe Vera, and 29 other ingredients that
[3:54:21.240 --> 3:54:25.480]  are really known to detoxify and clean out your GI tract.
[3:54:25.480 --> 3:54:30.480]  New Vitality says all this well-documented, high-quality stuff, 1-800-569-4056.
[3:54:30.480 --> 3:54:32.960]  Here's the number, 1-800-569-4056.
[3:54:32.960 --> 3:54:36.600]  They have things like Superbeta Prostate, one of the best formulas out there, with
[3:54:36.600 --> 3:54:40.000]  the Solpalmetto and a bunch of other ingredients, scientifically proven to me, even mainline
[3:54:40.000 --> 3:54:47.800]  doctors prescribe it, to shrink the prostate and health of that, 1-800-569-4056, or newvitality.com.
[3:54:47.800 --> 3:54:53.320]  If you forget it, the banner's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[3:54:53.320 --> 3:54:56.840]  And then another wonderful sponsor.
[3:54:56.840 --> 3:55:01.880]  It's not just that we have a storeable foods sponsor, eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:55:01.880 --> 3:55:07.520]  There's ways to store food in your own home and do it inexpensively from the store, and
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:11.680]  they teach you the secrets of that at FoodShortageUSA.com.
[3:55:11.680 --> 3:55:15.880]  With all the craziness coming, it's smart to have some storeable food, firearms, things
[3:55:15.880 --> 3:55:16.880]  like that.
[3:55:16.880 --> 3:55:17.880]  FoodShortageUSA.com.
[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:20.720]  It's just FoodShortageUSA.com.
[3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:25.040]  You go there to learn how to make your own storeable foods for you and your family, prepare
[3:55:25.040 --> 3:55:26.040]  for the road ahead.
[3:55:26.040 --> 3:55:29.680]  This website reveals a step-by-step way for the average guy to get prepared for what's
[3:55:29.680 --> 3:55:30.680]  ahead.
[3:55:30.680 --> 3:55:33.360]  I think the best part about the system is it gets you off the food grid, even if you
[3:55:33.360 --> 3:55:37.720]  don't have a lot of money to spend, the site is FoodShortageUSA.com.
[3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:47.160]  Or here's the number, 877-327-0365-877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[3:55:47.160 --> 3:55:55.080]  The key here is being self-sufficient, not being dependent on the system.
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:55:56.720]  Re-broadcast starts in about three minutes.
[3:55:56.720 --> 3:56:00.040]  We're going to finish up with Webster Tire Pally, but Tex Marge was on the show, a lot
[3:56:00.040 --> 3:56:01.040]  of key news.
[3:56:01.040 --> 3:56:05.240]  I also had Frank Colliendo, the big, one of the top comedians in the country on doing
[3:56:05.240 --> 3:56:06.480]  George Bush imitations.
[3:56:06.480 --> 3:56:10.680]  The show starts with that, the very first minute of the show, so you'll want to tune
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:15.240]  in for that on the internet rebroadcast, and of course stations re-air this on MNFM Dial
[3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:16.480]  across the country.
[3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:21.600]  But before you close out with the eugenicist austerity carbon movement for the banks, paid
[3:56:21.600 --> 3:56:26.480]  to them in summation to the master plan that Obama is pushing, even more than McCain, which
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:31.240]  is more proof in the pudding, that has all the Wall Street funding, not McCain, more
[3:56:31.240 --> 3:56:32.240]  proof.
[3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:33.240]  Tell us about your two books.
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:37.320]  Well, one is Obama, the post-modern coup, the making of a Manchurian candidate.
[3:56:37.320 --> 3:56:41.480]  That I believe you have in stock, so I urge people to get it from you.
[3:56:41.480 --> 3:56:47.520]  That's essentially the parallels to Carter, the matrix of Obama, the trilateral Bilderberg
[3:56:47.520 --> 3:56:55.760]  Rand Corporation, and how the Obama campaign resembles nothing so much as the Orange Revolution
[3:56:55.760 --> 3:56:58.000]  in Ukraine back in 2004.
[3:56:58.000 --> 3:56:59.960]  And then the new book, quickly.
[3:56:59.960 --> 3:57:04.640]  Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography, the entire story.
[3:57:04.640 --> 3:57:11.360]  Foundation operative, poverty pimp, Resco, Alchi, Al-Samari, Ayers, Dorn, Wright.
[3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:13.400]  Amazon.com and many other places.
[3:57:13.400 --> 3:57:15.120]  You got about one minute left.
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:20.000]  Webster, again, the eugenicist, the carbon tax, explain to the left what this is.
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:25.360]  Well, the thing for the left, I think, if you're going to have Naomi there, you got
[3:57:25.360 --> 3:57:31.200]  to ask her, what is the difference between a police state that's only top down and a
[3:57:31.200 --> 3:57:32.200]  fascist regime?
[3:57:32.200 --> 3:57:34.960]  Because she's saying we're slipping into fascism.
[3:57:34.960 --> 3:57:39.640]  She talks about this as if this were purely a matter of the FBI and the National Security
[3:57:39.640 --> 3:57:40.640]  Agency.
[3:57:40.640 --> 3:57:45.360]  What about the hallmark of fascism, which is this movement that comes up from the gutter
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:51.240]  with left cover and radical cover and anti-authoritarian cover and pretends to be liberation from
[3:57:51.240 --> 3:57:52.240]  the old order?
[3:57:52.240 --> 3:57:53.240]  And that's fascism.
[3:57:53.240 --> 3:57:57.800]  Anacarbon tax, anacarbon tax, paid directly to the bankers.
[3:57:57.800 --> 3:58:01.480]  Webster, thank you so much for being on with us.
[3:58:01.480 --> 3:58:06.040]  Retransmission starts now at one place, prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[3:58:06.040 --> 3:58:07.200]  Listen to the streams there.
[3:58:07.200 --> 3:58:26.120]  Frank Colliendo in one minute, stay with us.
