[00:00.000 --> 00:06.960]  you have the power humanity has the power we have the power do you want to
[00:06.960 --> 00:11.320]  fight you better believe you got one
[00:11.320 --> 00:20.400]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[00:20.400 --> 00:31.080]  I got up here to the office about an hour ago and it was a Sunday I've been
[00:31.080 --> 00:34.120]  busy taking care of other work most of the day I was a bit lethargic I was a
[00:34.120 --> 00:38.040]  bit tired I shuffled through hundreds of news stories watched different video
[00:38.040 --> 00:43.720]  clips and was just exhausted but as I got ready to go live on air I became
[00:43.720 --> 00:50.360]  totally energized because I'm a fighter this is not my regular personality to
[00:50.360 --> 00:55.080]  get up here and get upset but when I sit here and I look at open-world
[00:55.080 --> 01:01.320]  government being set up by above-the-law mega banks whose ideology is eugenics
[01:01.320 --> 01:06.800]  and anti-human exterminism and I realized that my ancestors fought that
[01:06.800 --> 01:13.120]  that I would be free and be able to lead my own life today and I love humanity
[01:13.120 --> 01:18.960]  past present and future I inherently at a genetic and spiritual level want to pay
[01:18.960 --> 01:23.080]  that forward into the future because I am part of the great human experience I
[01:23.080 --> 01:29.120]  have true brotherly love and by the way that's really nothing special in any
[01:29.120 --> 01:33.320]  successful culture people are good they love each other on average they stand
[01:33.320 --> 01:37.120]  up for each other they have their optimistic they love trailblazers they
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.600]  love artists they love honor they love beauty they love decency they love
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.200]  family all of that is under attack and being made artificially harder and
[01:46.200 --> 01:51.240]  harder to have so that we're completely empty and go along with the system and
[01:51.240 --> 01:55.200]  go along with the globalist and that's why I'm so angry that's why I'm so
[01:55.200 --> 02:00.000]  focused that's why I'm so upset and trying to shake humanity out of this
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.840]  trance now can we come in in the next segment I should have told you guys this
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.640]  before the show but I love that intro for those about to rock because I think
[02:09.640 --> 02:14.600]  that intro basically will set the stage for what I'm going to cover but all of
[02:14.600 --> 02:18.320]  you who are about to stand against tyranny I salute you and I want to make
[02:18.320 --> 02:22.320]  that clear we're going to break in a few minutes the long segments are coming up
[02:22.320 --> 02:27.120]  we're going to be opening the phones up today to ask viewers and listeners where
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.800]  is too far is there too far is there any line in the sand that the global
[02:31.800 --> 02:36.400]  social engineers can cross where you will stand up to them economically
[02:36.400 --> 02:41.640]  culturally in the First Amendment in free speech or physically is there any
[02:41.640 --> 02:46.640]  line that isn't too far for them to pass because they're testing us and because
[02:46.640 --> 02:50.120]  we have so much entertainment and a false bubble we live in and they're still
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.600]  enough food to eat as all our basic freedoms are being dismantled as the
[02:54.600 --> 02:59.480]  lights are being turned off as tyranny spreads worldwide
[02:59.480 --> 03:05.240]  some people are upset and awake but many others are in a trance not aware of it
[03:05.240 --> 03:11.240]  so I'm here to try to break people out of their trances or maybe I'm wrong maybe
[03:11.240 --> 03:15.120]  having the RNC and DNC announced they're gonna steal the popular vote with the
[03:15.120 --> 03:20.240]  delegates from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders for the first time ever selling it
[03:20.240 --> 03:25.160]  like it's no big deal selling it like it's acceptable that's outrageous all
[03:25.160 --> 03:32.240]  the media coverage all the incredible hype all of them oh election night the
[03:32.240 --> 03:37.760]  primary your vote you voted you count this is your country we're gonna see what
[03:37.760 --> 03:41.480]  happens one man one vote then they go oh actually doesn't matter if Donald Trump
[03:41.480 --> 03:46.960]  has 12,000 or a 1220 something delegates or doesn't matter if he has double what
[03:46.960 --> 03:50.640]  Ted Cruz has it doesn't matter we're gonna go ahead and just change the rules
[03:50.640 --> 03:56.040]  however we want in the middle of the game to make sure he loses and they're
[03:56.040 --> 03:59.400]  throwing it in our face and acting like it's completely normal what is the other
[03:59.400 --> 04:05.480]  big shoe to drop after that what else is coming and what will you do when they
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.800]  do this the media is throwing a conniption fit the dinosaur media the
[04:09.800 --> 04:15.440]  prostitute media the sepicon media the predator media the collaborator media
[04:15.440 --> 04:21.600]  the trader media I don't know what you call them just absolute decepticons
[04:21.600 --> 04:27.240]  they're freaking out on the fact that Roger Stone who is one of Trump's top
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.400]  advisors his former business partners now becoming basically his new chief of
[04:31.400 --> 04:37.240]  staff they're freaking out he came on the show Thursday and said was it
[04:37.240 --> 04:42.440]  Wednesday took a few days to notice it and said hey if they steal the election
[04:42.440 --> 04:50.240]  in the RNC this year in Cleveland Ohio we need to have giant
[04:50.240 --> 04:53.360]  demonstrations pointing out it's happening and they try to imply that

[07:01.280 --> 07:11.960]  receive I have been studying the globalist for about 25 years I went on
[07:11.960 --> 07:20.680]  there more than 21 years and I've expected to see a lot of tyranny I've
[07:20.680 --> 07:24.840]  expected to see global government grow and take over the planet and put
[07:24.840 --> 07:28.680]  surveillance equipment in every major appliance and watch us and listen to us
[07:28.680 --> 07:35.720]  and track everything we do so that the social engineers can predict the future
[07:35.720 --> 07:41.080]  and predict trends and dominate the future and control the economic destiny
[07:41.080 --> 07:46.160]  and hence the physical destiny the cultural destiny of humans on this
[07:46.160 --> 07:52.040]  planet people think they're listening to you with AI computers over your smart
[07:52.040 --> 07:56.920]  TV and your smartphone 24-7 at all times because they want to know if you're a
[07:56.920 --> 08:02.200]  terrorist no they run and fund the real terrorist but the controllers the top
[08:02.200 --> 08:09.720]  dude they steer them they want all of your data so that they can actuary in
[08:09.720 --> 08:19.200]  algorithms everything you're going to do did do and we'll do into the future
[08:20.480 --> 08:24.560]  people say I don't care if they're spying on me I have nothing to hide really as if
[08:24.560 --> 08:29.640]  the people spying on you the big corporations the multinationals the
[08:29.640 --> 08:36.320]  foreign governments are so-called government as if they might not want to
[08:36.320 --> 08:40.720]  use your information against you as if they might not want to use it to
[08:40.720 --> 08:47.960]  manipulate the economy and say increase the price of natural gas or
[08:47.960 --> 08:54.040]  manipulate the price of a commodity or that's how this whole thing works and as
[08:54.040 --> 09:00.720]  everything gets wired in that allows these AI systems to totally game
[09:00.720 --> 09:06.840]  everything for the insiders we told you decades ago that the stock market was
[09:06.840 --> 09:12.440]  rigged they came out the last month and said that 98% of the trades the last
[09:12.440 --> 09:17.880]  decade the United States were basically controlled and artificial and
[09:17.880 --> 09:23.000]  manipulated by the private Federal Reserve for their shareholders game not
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.760]  yours the interest rates for decades have been completely rigged globally
[09:27.760 --> 09:35.160]  currency rates have been rigged it goes on and on it's a totally rigged system
[09:35.160 --> 09:46.600]  it's not capitalism it's not communism it is artificial synthetic AI fascism and
[09:46.600 --> 09:54.240]  they can give you a tiny slice of synthetic food bobbles games false
[09:54.240 --> 10:01.080]  culture reality TV that sucks you in so that while you sleep the social
[10:01.080 --> 10:06.160]  engineers live they don't want you in the real world they don't want you being
[10:06.160 --> 10:10.800]  informed they don't want you involved they want you to respond to their
[10:10.800 --> 10:19.600]  stimuli react to what they program you with so you cease to be a sentient
[10:19.600 --> 10:26.160]  conscious being and become a totally predictable programmable cog in their
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.560]  machine
[10:31.960 --> 10:36.320]  there was an article out in a big study earlier this week that children will put
[10:36.320 --> 10:44.440]  it on screen spend more time indoors in the Western world than prisoners do and
[10:44.440 --> 10:51.920]  now you see articles every few days were a 10 12 13 year old their parents don't
[10:51.920 --> 10:56.440]  get home till 5 30 or 6 they get home at 3 30 or 4 they forget their key that
[10:56.440 --> 10:59.960]  happened to me many times so they're caught in the backyard playing but
[10:59.960 --> 11:06.200]  basketball or caught across the street at the park and they're taken by CPS from
[11:06.200 --> 11:14.840]  their parents because they just label it neglect just like you can label any
[11:14.840 --> 11:19.280]  word or any phrase is hateful and then have quote government ban it this is
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.320]  the incredible oppression that's not coming it's here and I go back to that
[11:24.320 --> 11:28.360]  because if we don't understand how we're losing our physicality how we're
[11:28.360 --> 11:37.920]  losing our humanity we have no future here's the Financial Times of London
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.240]  technology slaves missing out on real experiences I'm gonna cover some of that
[11:43.240 --> 11:52.680]  article today because that's just the heart of what we face as a species but
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.800]  if you take time out to read the white papers to read the books written by the
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.840]  social engineers you'll understand this is a plan by design that they're very
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.720]  proud of and they think you're too stupid to go find out this has been a
[12:07.720 --> 12:19.080]  laid in the foundations of the global government operation to turn you into
[12:20.480 --> 12:25.520]  someone who isn't even conscious someone who is even alive someone who isn't
[12:25.520 --> 12:31.280]  even sentient and so someone who doesn't even have rights and their big joke is
[12:31.280 --> 12:35.280]  you have to be convinced to accept it and that you will sign away and write
[12:35.280 --> 12:40.280]  away by thousands of decisions on paper millions of little decisions but
[12:40.280 --> 12:46.760]  thousands of big decisions that you will submit to them and opt into their
[12:46.760 --> 12:53.480]  operation and opt in to losing your humanity and what's left of it and the
[12:53.480 --> 12:57.800]  social engineers believe that you have no right to consciousness because if you
[12:57.800 --> 13:02.000]  were ever conscious to begin with you couldn't have been induced to waive your
[13:02.000 --> 13:10.600]  rights and become a mind-wipe slave to begin with so we're cutting right to the
[13:10.600 --> 13:16.400]  chase here the foundation of where all this comes from what it's currently
[13:16.400 --> 13:21.560]  doing and where it's going I've got plenty of riveting powerful news today
[13:21.560 --> 13:25.320]  and we're going to get into it right now but I just need to relate to everybody
[13:25.320 --> 13:29.560]  that this is not a simulation this is not a drill this is not a game it's not a
[13:29.560 --> 13:32.800]  joke it's really happening
[13:36.920 --> 13:48.200]  now I'm going to get today into this big breaking story about offshore money
[13:48.200 --> 13:53.520]  that is flooding into Panama and other areas and the biggest data leak ever
[13:53.520 --> 13:57.120]  bigger than wiki leaks and oh my gosh it's going to destroy the elite they're
[13:57.120 --> 14:01.000]  in so much trouble just a first approximation of this because it broke
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.520]  last night is that this is the real elite burning smaller level low level
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.240]  elites to keep them in line and going after kind of the manager class of the
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.000]  establishment that's copied the big wigs above them this is just going to be a
[14:17.000 --> 14:24.960]  giant tax robbery from quote tax havens to claw that money back not into nation
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.800]  states or individuals but into the global power structure to not use the
[14:29.800 --> 14:34.320]  money to turn the economy on to use the money to further turn the economy off by
[14:34.320 --> 14:39.920]  simply destroying the digital money by assigning it to giant derivative black
[14:39.920 --> 14:45.680]  holes and I say that because I look at who they listed here the heads of the
[14:45.680 --> 14:53.520]  big global soccer federations movie stars people like that the type of folks
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.000]  the general public think of as rich powerful elites and the type of people
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.920]  leaving France by the thousands in England and Germany and just taking
[15:01.920 --> 15:06.840]  their money legally and lawfully and leaving the country the establishment
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.640]  wants to extinguish all of that because they want everyone so poor that only the
[15:12.640 --> 15:17.360]  establishment has currency and property and capital and so that everyone has to
[15:17.360 --> 15:22.840]  basically sell themselves even further to the establishment and fully have
[15:22.840 --> 15:28.160]  their backs broken so they will be forced to totally submit and at another
[15:28.160 --> 15:31.600]  level beyond just new vorice trying to hide some of their money that's why
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.720]  there's a war on lemonade stands a war on Amish a war on raw milk a war on
[15:35.720 --> 15:43.160]  smart swap meets a war on farmers markets they admit there's a war on them

[20:48.920 --> 20:53.320]  this week Joe Biggs is on the east coast he'll be joining us tomorrow a lot of

[20:58.520 --> 21:03.720]  will go interview one anti-trump person but then ignore hundreds of people for
[21:03.720 --> 21:09.240]  Trump we estimate is 50 to 1 in Wisconsin for Trump we have videos
[21:09.240 --> 21:15.760]  showing that up on info wars comm and I want to be clear I have issues with
[21:15.760 --> 21:20.400]  Trump on the Apple iPhone I have issues with Trump on torture I have issues with
[21:20.400 --> 21:23.960]  Trump on a lot of things but I think he genuinely really says what he thinks he
[21:23.960 --> 21:29.760]  has to say and the establishment is scared of him but regardless he's winning
[21:29.760 --> 21:36.600]  the popular vote by landslide in the primaries and already in multiple states
[21:36.600 --> 21:42.840]  they have taken the popular vote from him and given it to Ted Cruz I shot a
[21:42.840 --> 21:48.440]  special report on that yesterday in Tennessee in Louisiana and now other
[21:48.440 --> 21:53.040]  states he wins but they give the delegates to Cruz and then say he wins
[21:53.040 --> 21:57.400]  and then the Tennessean newspaper and others come out and act like Trump's
[21:57.400 --> 22:05.160]  the sore loser the media says oh Donald Trump didn't know what he's doing that's
[22:05.160 --> 22:09.320]  why he's losing his delegates the delegates are pledged in their
[22:09.320 --> 22:14.840]  precinct to whoever got the popular vote and then they're proportioned in most
[22:14.840 --> 22:22.160]  states some states are one or take all but very few that's why they're prized
[22:22.160 --> 22:26.040]  and coveted but most states like Texas in other areas it's apportioned and then
[22:26.040 --> 22:31.120]  so if someone in a district as a delegate is an apportion for those groups
[22:31.120 --> 22:34.240]  they represent those voters and they they pledge to do that that's the way
[22:34.240 --> 22:40.160]  it's always been but now they quote change the rules in 78 but we're never
[22:40.160 --> 22:43.560]  willing to actually overthrow an election they talked about it with Reagan in
[22:43.560 --> 22:49.320]  1980 Trump's now hired Roger Stone's former business partner Stone was
[22:49.320 --> 22:54.440]  involved as well with a firm that battled for Reagan in 1980 and defeated
[22:54.440 --> 23:03.800]  the move to do that and now Trump's former chief of staff has been somewhat
[23:03.800 --> 23:08.400]  sidelined and Stone's business partner is now being made according to the New
[23:08.400 --> 23:11.200]  York Times and of course I heard about it before it was in the New York Times
[23:11.200 --> 23:15.040]  but the point is now I can talk about it that really this is the face-saving you
[23:15.040 --> 23:20.080]  know shadow head of the campaign will just remain the shadow which is a
[23:20.080 --> 23:24.480]  consortium of people and they'll still have ladowski out there nothing against
[23:24.480 --> 23:27.680]  ladowski he's just not as sophisticated as some of these other people so that's
[23:27.680 --> 23:33.280]  a big plus for Trump but I just sit here watching the psychological warfare the
[23:33.280 --> 23:41.560]  Psyop of every channel I watch from MSNBC to Fox going what's the big deal
[23:41.560 --> 23:46.560]  previous on Fox previous on CNBC the head of the Republican Election Rules
[23:46.560 --> 23:56.320]  Committee Curly Huland replay clip of him in a moment saying hey media stop
[23:56.320 --> 23:59.840]  telling folks the popular votes you count it never has it's always been the
[23:59.840 --> 24:05.640]  party that's not true you have election money you have state election laws you
[24:05.640 --> 24:10.280]  have false advertising that they're saying your vote counts your election get
[24:10.280 --> 24:15.920]  out there go for your candidate this giant fraud the media making billions
[24:15.920 --> 24:20.320]  every election cycle every year covering your vote tonight what happened with
[24:20.320 --> 24:25.960]  you and now they say oh guess what it's all fake what if the author of the fix
[24:25.960 --> 24:30.640]  is in back on where he breaks down how the NFL tickets all the other major
[24:30.640 --> 24:36.480]  tickets say on them entertainment purposes only this is not really a game
[24:36.480 --> 24:41.360]  and then that's how they're allowed at key games and key events with the
[24:41.360 --> 24:45.280]  billions that are being gambled every game bigger than the whole profit of the
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.680]  sport for a whole year I'm just picking out the NFL they all do it and then when
[24:49.680 --> 24:55.600]  it comes time every team folks engages in fraud every major quarterback takes a
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.120]  dive every I mean it's just fraud up one side down the other because it's all
[25:01.120 --> 25:08.080]  entertainment now that's according to our sources and our experts and it's come
[25:08.080 --> 25:14.400]  out and the FBI's never been allowed to go after any big sports that's why you
[25:14.400 --> 25:19.400]  know Pete Rose gotten so much trouble gambling when he was a coach because he
[25:19.400 --> 25:24.520]  got caught and oh it's totally clean no one's ever gotten in trouble he was just
[25:24.520 --> 25:30.520]  so out in the open about it that's why he was punished so the corruption is
[25:30.520 --> 25:36.200]  coming out and Donald Trump says look they want to knock out the outsider they
[25:36.200 --> 25:42.200]  want to keep their little party going I'm gonna play that clip and then MSNBC
[25:42.200 --> 25:46.320]  saying Trump's losing delegates because he doesn't know what he's doing funny I
[25:46.320 --> 25:50.640]  thought he went I thought he ran I thought they were pledged to him and even
[25:50.640 --> 25:53.160]  if there was gonna be a fight over the delegates it would happen in Cleveland
[25:53.160 --> 25:57.760]  this summer no Ted Cruz and the RNC are getting them at the state level so they
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.840]  announced oh Trump won Tennessee Trump won Louisiana and then a week later
[26:01.840 --> 26:06.880]  sorry he lost it then the newspapers come out and say well the delegates
[26:06.880 --> 26:16.280]  didn't go to him they go to Ted Cruz now and Cooke's don't like it so I guess if
[26:16.280 --> 26:20.640]  a child molester grabs your five-year-old out of the backyard and a month
[26:20.640 --> 26:24.880]  later the cops pull them over and find your kid dead in the trunk all that
[26:24.880 --> 26:31.120]  killer's got to do is get out and say hey it's a conspiracy theory that what I
[26:31.120 --> 26:36.200]  did was wrong the serial killer won't even deny there's a dead kid in the back
[26:36.200 --> 26:41.120]  of the trunk and video cassettes of the serial killer torturing the serial
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.720]  killer will say you are a conspiracy theorist for thinking it's wrong I
[26:45.720 --> 26:48.840]  grabbed your five-year-old out of the backyard and tortured him for three
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.040]  weeks and let me tell you it was fun I have a right to grab your kid I have a
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.320]  right to torture him I have a right to kill him and have him beg for mommy and
[26:56.320 --> 27:01.880]  daddy for three weeks before I finally strangle him I killed him I'll kill more
[27:01.880 --> 27:06.720]  kids there's nothing you can do and the fact that you don't like it makes you a
[27:06.720 --> 27:10.720]  conspiracy theorist you see they've gone from if you question a known lying
[27:10.720 --> 27:17.640]  government saying you're a conspiracy theorist too if you don't like something
[27:17.640 --> 27:22.320]  I've had the TSA what I don't want to be searched say oh we got one of these
[27:22.320 --> 27:27.000]  conspiracy theorists see having an opinion knowing the three branches of
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.840]  government being able to tie your shoelaces being able to find your rear
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.820]  end with both hands that is now a conspiracy theory in a world of inept
[27:35.820 --> 27:39.960]  dumbed-down jellyfish let's play this clip of Donald Trump telling it like it
[27:39.960 --> 27:47.280]  is I'm speaking in front of thousands of people for a week I win and I get few
[27:47.280 --> 27:53.240]  delegates and he's got okay it's not fair folks it's not fair because I'm the
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.280]  outsider and what they do is they want to knock out the outsider because they
[27:57.280 --> 28:02.480]  want to keep their little party going and the reason our country owes 21 and
[28:02.480 --> 28:09.440]  soon 21 trillion not billion trillion dollars okay the reason we owe all of
[28:09.440 --> 28:13.520]  this money is because of the system so right is what we got to do we're gonna
[28:13.520 --> 28:18.680]  win so much what you have to do is go out and vote get everything I tell you
[28:18.680 --> 28:23.600]  I'm all in for Donald Trump folks and he may not be perfect I don't know where
[28:23.600 --> 28:25.920]  this is going but the whole establishments against him all these
[28:25.920 --> 28:29.280]  foreign governments are telling us we can't have him they're stealing states
[28:29.280 --> 28:35.120]  from in front of everybody and wait they're doing to Bernie Sanders too he
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.960]  wins all these states they just take the delegates I mean what is your line in
[28:39.960 --> 28:43.880]  the sand is there any level of garbage you won't put up with I'm gonna give the
[28:43.880 --> 28:47.160]  number out when we come back I want to ask you that question I mean where are
[28:47.160 --> 28:53.360]  they going next after this seriously info wars.com or slash show you can send

[28:58.360 --> 29:01.760]  see what the tolerant and loving anti-trump supporters have been up to
[29:01.760 --> 29:06.560]  this week in their quest to stomp out fascism after offending a German Jewish
[29:06.560 --> 29:11.200]  immigrant by waving a Trump equals Nazi sign right in his face a Bernie Sanders
[29:11.200 --> 29:14.840]  supporter told the man he needed to go back to Germany further demonstrating
[29:14.840 --> 29:18.280]  the excessive hypocrisy of social justice warriors who are completely
[29:18.280 --> 29:22.360]  intolerant and in this case xenophobic to anyone who disagrees with their
[29:22.360 --> 29:26.880]  worldviews and to counter the violent rhetoric of Donald Trump a supporter of
[29:26.880 --> 29:30.320]  the Never Trump movement advertised t-shirts for sale advocating the
[29:30.320 --> 29:34.400]  assassination of Donald Trump no reports of anyone getting beaten for wearing

[29:46.520 --> 29:50.880]  respond well they proceeded to mock the boy on Twitter just another week in the
[29:50.880 --> 29:57.240]  Orwellian world of the lefty hypocrisy Leanne McAdoo reporting for info wars.com

[33:01.160 --> 33:03.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:03.800 --> 33:29.960]  I'm awake. I'm informed. I don't want to be a slave. I'm upset about what's happening.
[33:29.960 --> 33:33.800]  I'm your host Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us. I want to open the phones up
[33:33.800 --> 33:41.080]  in the next segment and have open phones throughout the broadcast. Rob Duh and Krube are in Wisconsin
[33:41.080 --> 33:45.480]  and Illinois. They've been following Trump for a full week. They've had some of the most viral
[33:45.480 --> 33:52.280]  news videos out there garnering millions of views in just the last week. So I want to salute those
[33:52.280 --> 33:59.160]  guys. They will report to us on their findings. What they have been discovering is that 50 to 1
[33:59.160 --> 34:06.200]  conservatively more pro-Trump people in Wisconsin than there are protesters. But the media comes
[34:06.200 --> 34:10.840]  up and will put the cameras real close to the protesters to create the illusion that there's
[34:10.840 --> 34:17.320]  a bunch of anti-Trump people. Then they'll go find a small throng away from the main crowd
[34:17.320 --> 34:23.320]  of thousands of Trump supporters and show them. I learned this 20 years ago. I'd be at a pro-gun
[34:23.320 --> 34:27.720]  rally we'd have. We'd have like 2,000 people at the Capitol. Sometimes like 5,000 would show up.
[34:27.720 --> 34:34.360]  And they would go and show the corner of the crowd and say dozens showed up or
[34:34.360 --> 34:42.760]  a dozen showed up. Mainstream media relishes deceiving you. And the reason they're getting
[34:42.760 --> 34:48.040]  in so much trouble is there's YouTube. There's Facebook. There's all these video sites where
[34:48.040 --> 34:54.520]  people are going out and seeing what really happened versus what the media says what happened.
[34:54.520 --> 35:02.280]  But the mainstream media's tactic is start censoring the Internet, start going after
[35:02.280 --> 35:07.240]  new media, start shutting things down because if they can't beat us their answer is shut us down.
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.960]  So what is your line in the sand? Will they ever go too far? What are you doing to fight this
[35:13.960 --> 35:19.640]  tyranny? And if they're openly stealing the election from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders,
[35:19.640 --> 35:24.600]  but much worse with Trump, Sanders was winning the first state. So they sold Ohio,
[35:25.160 --> 35:27.720]  turned out, came out in court. He won. They still gave it to Hillary.
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.720]  He won 20 points in New Hampshire. They still gave most of the delegates to Hillary.
[35:35.480 --> 35:40.600]  And so it created a self-fulfilling prophecy because the Democrats were really smart. They
[35:40.600 --> 35:45.080]  started stealing the delegates the day after just saying, sorry, state doesn't go to you.
[35:45.080 --> 35:53.000]  The Republicans said, we're going to wait till we get to Cleveland in the summer. And then we're
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.720]  going to take, I mean, they said that on the news last few months. But then the perception was,
[35:59.720 --> 36:04.360]  well, wait, Trump has like double what Cruz does. This looks bad. We'll start stealing it at the
[36:04.360 --> 36:09.960]  state level. So they stole the election in Texas. That's come out very clear. Stole the delegates
[36:09.960 --> 36:15.880]  outright in Louisiana, Tennessee and other states. So that even though he wins that night,
[36:16.600 --> 36:23.080]  he doesn't win the next day or the next week. So I'm asking you, how much worse is this going
[36:23.080 --> 36:27.240]  to get? I mean, if they're going to start openly stealing elections, we know they've
[36:27.240 --> 36:33.160]  messed with them before. Some have been stolen. I say be involved to keep the system honest,
[36:33.160 --> 36:40.520]  to point out it's a fraud. You give up and say it's all over. Then the sky's the limit.
[36:40.520 --> 36:46.280]  That's my view. Maybe I'm wrong. But it is really getting crazy and never forget
[36:47.080 --> 36:52.440]  in Gallup and a bunch of other national polls, Congress has between an eight and 11% approval
[36:52.440 --> 37:00.920]  rating. Government in general has like a 15% approval rating. So the people know that we're
[37:00.920 --> 37:04.600]  in trouble and I don't want to just blame the government itself. We've let it get corrupt.
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.640]  We've let special interest come in, ignore the law, ignore the rules, do whatever they want.
[37:09.640 --> 37:18.840]  It's back in the news today. President Obama, the board patrol has reported their main union
[37:18.840 --> 37:24.200]  this weekend is increasing the amount of legals coming in and not even letting the board patrol
[37:24.200 --> 37:29.640]  stop anybody now, including drug smugglers. The border is wide open. Oh, but you've got to go to
[37:29.640 --> 37:34.280]  the TSA. You've got to go through a checkpoint. You've got to be spied on to make sure we're all
[37:34.280 --> 37:39.560]  safe. But the border is wide open. They're flying tens of thousands of refugees in with no vetting,
[37:39.560 --> 37:47.640]  no IDs, no passports, but that's okay. Board patrol counsel says catch and release policy
[37:47.640 --> 37:54.600]  continues fueling illegal immigration. No kidding. So this is a lawless takeover. Here's the toll
[37:54.600 --> 38:06.680]  free number to join us. 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX. All I ask is is that you have
[38:06.680 --> 38:13.400]  a good phone and not be too drunk. I know it's Sunday afternoon, but please. Let's go back to
[38:13.400 --> 38:17.000]  the original clip because it's so powerful. I'm going to play that first clip one more time and
[38:17.000 --> 38:23.480]  then MSNBC. But this is Trump. Republican party bosses want to knock out the outsider to keep
[38:23.480 --> 38:32.280]  their little party going. I'm speaking in front of thousands of people for a week. I win and I get
[38:32.280 --> 38:39.480]  fewer delegates than he's got. Okay, it's not fair, folks. It's not fair because I'm the outsider
[38:39.480 --> 38:43.560]  and what they do is they want to knock out the outsider because they want to keep their little
[38:43.560 --> 38:54.840]  party going. And the reason our country owes 21 trillion dollars. The reason we owe all of this
[38:54.840 --> 39:00.200]  money is because of the system. So here's what we got to do. We're going to win so much. What you
[39:00.200 --> 39:05.160]  have to do is go out and vote. That's right. And quite frankly, I know from inside baseball,
[39:05.720 --> 39:08.600]  Trump had to be encouraged to even talk about this because he doesn't want to be seen as a
[39:08.600 --> 39:14.760]  sore loser. But if you win the ND 500 by a mile and they give it to the guy that was a mile behind
[39:14.760 --> 39:20.680]  you, you don't just say, I've been robbed. You've been robbed. You go punch him in the face.
[39:21.960 --> 39:26.280]  The judges need to be tarred and feathered. And I don't mean literally. I'm saying if this was
[39:26.280 --> 39:31.160]  the ND 500, the judges say, you know, Dale Earnhardt didn't win it when he won it by a mile.
[39:31.160 --> 39:36.440]  Everybody sees it in front of God and man. I mean, you got to get angry, folks. And Trump
[39:36.440 --> 39:43.720]  isn't even angry enough because he knows how asleep the public is, by the way. You're being robbed
[39:43.720 --> 39:49.800]  nakedly. Sanders won't even talk about how he's being robbed because the mainstream media looks
[39:49.800 --> 39:57.960]  down on that and they're all busy making it normal. Let's play this MSNBC piece from last Thursday.
[39:57.960 --> 40:07.320]  There's a bunch of other ones and they have Buzzfeed and alternate and just scores of articles
[40:07.320 --> 40:13.080]  out today attacking Roger Stone and yours truly Alex Jones. Trump ally Roger Stone says he's
[40:13.080 --> 40:19.240]  planning days of rage at the convention. The former Trump advisor says he's planning protests
[40:19.240 --> 40:25.960]  with allies in Cleveland and street theater and won't let them quote steal the nomination.
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.400]  And they have other channels saying Alex Jones is called for riots. Alex Jones is called for.
[40:31.400 --> 40:36.680]  What I've called for is five billion people. Set it now. Go to Cleveland. I'm going to be there
[40:36.680 --> 40:41.560]  the whole time. Be there to promote freedom. Be there to promote liberty. Be there to outnumber
[40:41.560 --> 40:49.960]  the Soros bots 10 to one and be there so that if they steal it openly, we all just shout,
[40:49.960 --> 40:53.960]  you stole it. You are criminals. You are thieves because if we just don't show up
[40:53.960 --> 41:00.760]  and let them steal the election, it'll normalize it. This could really blow up in their faces.
[41:00.760 --> 41:04.440]  So they're trying to imply we're going there to burn things down and riot. Ladies and gentlemen,
[41:04.440 --> 41:08.200]  that'd be the dumbest thing in the world to do. That's what the Soros crowds and the Black Lives
[41:08.200 --> 41:14.360]  Matter people do. We're going to be there as citizen journalists documenting the criminal empire
[41:14.360 --> 41:20.200]  and what it's done and energizing the people to respond and say we're not buying it. We're not
[41:20.200 --> 41:25.160]  going along with previous and the rest of them stealing the election. Let's go ahead and go to
[41:25.160 --> 41:30.280]  this clip. Trump may not have the wherewithal to get enough votes on the convention floor.
[41:30.280 --> 41:35.160]  Supporters like Info Wars, Alex Jones are now preparing to revolt. Back in the beginning,
[41:35.160 --> 41:38.120]  again, Trump may not have the wherewithal
[41:41.400 --> 41:45.000]  because they're stealing it and have never done this before.
[41:45.000 --> 41:52.040]  It's his fault that he won the election. It's his fault he's way ahead in the leader,
[41:52.040 --> 41:57.000]  clearly the winner. It's his fault they're stealing it. See the spin? Let's go back to it.
[41:57.800 --> 42:02.440]  Find the pledge to get on the ballot in the first place. Amid growing signs that Trump may not
[42:02.440 --> 42:06.840]  have the wherewithal to get enough votes on the convention floor, supporters like Info Wars,
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.920]  Alex Jones, are now preparing to revolt. Be in Cleveland for the week of that convention.
[42:12.920 --> 42:20.120]  Be there and we are going to absolutely show the world the real power. We need five million
[42:21.240 --> 42:28.520]  constitutional Trumpians, Trumpist, to be there so that all the Soros trash and all the filth,
[42:28.520 --> 42:33.320]  the few hundred thousand they'll have there are totally dwarfed and the establishment does not
[42:33.320 --> 42:39.480]  dare steal the popular vote from the people. According to one party operative I spoke to
[42:39.480 --> 42:44.040]  a couple weeks ago, Republican National Committeeman named Curly Hogan, the popular vote doesn't
[42:44.040 --> 42:47.960]  matter at all. It's the delegates who really pick the nominee regardless of how the citizens
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.600]  in their states vote. Pause that we're gonna come back and play them openly saying oh your vote
[42:52.600 --> 42:58.680]  never counted and to see I'm the conspiracy theorist. Brainforce it's completely different,
[42:58.680 --> 43:05.480]  cry a bottle of it, Rob do joins us, you worked I guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brainforce
[43:05.480 --> 43:10.280]  did I've been working all day I took a couple hours off coaching basketball I get in here at
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.000]  8 30 I was kind of run down you know I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it and I really wanted
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.080]  to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of brainforce right there I popped two of them
[43:19.080 --> 43:23.880]  and about 20 minutes later it's like bing everything just kind of clears up it's got four
[43:23.880 --> 43:28.440]  and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third-party
[43:28.440 --> 43:33.240]  nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic
[43:33.240 --> 43:37.640]  based systems that will blow your socks off I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while
[43:37.640 --> 43:42.360]  but I probably could not have done it without brainforce I went home about 6 45 this morning
[43:42.360 --> 43:47.880]  took three hours of sleep got up took two more brainforce and came in you will find brainforce

[46:19.400 --> 46:25.720]  can't even keep up with it in our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than 7 000 feet
[46:25.720 --> 46:31.400]  to gather these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that we also screen

[46:37.160 --> 46:42.600]  i'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nason iodine that major brands and major

[47:34.040 --> 47:38.280]  all right the break cut off the clip the short clip i'm gonna play it all in its entirety right
[47:38.280 --> 47:40.600]  now i mean it's an eight-minute segment i'm gonna play about a minute and a half of it
[47:41.240 --> 47:46.040]  where uh rachel madow's twin chris hedges that's his name right
[47:48.920 --> 47:54.120]  he's on msnbc and he just calmly says it's trump's fault he didn't know what he's doing
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.440]  he's losing his delegates and uh you know we talked to officials this is the way it is your
[47:58.440 --> 48:02.040]  probably your vote doesn't matter and with a straight face for the next eight minutes they
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.800]  just sit there and go this is how it's always been you've never voted you people are crazy
[48:07.800 --> 48:15.880]  and i have him on cnbc and i have previs on on fox you've all seen it it's everywhere
[48:19.320 --> 48:23.240]  saying that the people really love this and this is the this is the way it's always been done
[48:24.120 --> 48:28.120]  now again the media acts like it's a popular vote they get up there in election night and
[48:28.120 --> 48:33.240]  watch the numbers and who are you voting for and it's your time to choose and i voted stickers and
[48:33.960 --> 48:41.000]  it's all a giant fraud state money and federal money is spent on elections it's racketeering
[48:41.000 --> 48:47.560]  to come out and say we've changed the rules and ignored you the parties go back to the
[48:47.560 --> 48:54.600]  time of the laws but they're only ceremonial as the body that's organized of the people to carry
[48:54.600 --> 49:01.320]  this out it won't stand up in court to say party officials who were never elected but were appointed
[49:01.320 --> 49:09.240]  by other party officials chose who would then be the nominee ignoring someone who has doubled the
[49:09.240 --> 49:18.920]  votes of their next competitor this is so fundamental it's like they have a contested school
[49:18.920 --> 49:25.720]  for whoever can do the most pull-ups in the fifth grade and one kid does 15 the next kid does seven
[49:25.720 --> 49:33.160]  and they go well the judge is the is the other kid's father so he'll we're gonna let the person
[49:33.160 --> 49:40.360]  that got seven pull-ups win i use the analogy of a child killer child molester grabbing a
[49:40.360 --> 49:43.800]  five-year-old out of the backyard being found the dead body a month later in the back of their car
[49:43.800 --> 49:49.640]  and the child molester killer doesn't deny that they killed the child they just say you're a
[49:49.640 --> 49:56.920]  conspiracy theorist i'm allowed to kill your kid and that's a brutal horrible sounding allegory
[49:56.920 --> 50:02.760]  but you know what stealing the election openly and telling you it's not a theft in some weird
[50:03.320 --> 50:13.000]  obi-wan Kenobi mind game mind you know what mind f i'm sorry that's what it is and then they look
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.240]  at everybody and go it's the conspiracy loon i've got articles right here in the media saying
[50:17.880 --> 50:22.840]  conspiracy theorist jones thinks it's wrong they're gonna ignore the popular vote
[50:24.520 --> 50:33.240]  that labels see trumps your vote literally trumps trump because they use the magic word like racism
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  you're against open borders you're against carbon taxes you're against obamacare
[50:39.000 --> 50:49.800]  because you found out it's a scam racist homophob sexist i'm gonna go to your phone calls but i
[50:49.800 --> 50:55.160]  want to play play this clip before we do it i'm really proud of the fact that we're listeners
[50:55.160 --> 51:00.600]  supported we have a new design of the hillary for prison t-shirt of the old design that was a
[51:00.600 --> 51:04.520]  collector's edition i do that every once in a while it was so popular everybody got mad
[51:04.520 --> 51:07.800]  that for four months i haven't been selling it so we've come out within the original
[51:07.800 --> 51:12.840]  but we've updated it so technically it's another collector's edition hillary for president 2016
[51:13.880 --> 51:20.680]  until the end of time it says underneath that and on the back we have changed the white to red
[51:20.680 --> 51:26.280]  where it says info wars dot com legalized freedom because everybody started cloning the shirt which
[51:26.280 --> 51:30.520]  is fine and and then folks were mad that we weren't making anymore and so this is the first time i've
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.600]  had a collector's shirt that i say is limited edition that i brought back technically it is a
[51:34.600 --> 51:40.120]  different shirt different colors different stuff but it's basically the same looks like an election
[51:40.120 --> 51:45.080]  shirt very very popular our second best-selling shirt ever the other one was a obama joker
[51:45.080 --> 51:48.520]  shirt that i did as a collector's edition i never brought that back because i promised i wouldn't
[51:48.520 --> 51:52.920]  but hillary could be indicted anytime the fbi says that they're probably about to call for her
[51:52.920 --> 51:58.120]  indictment if they don't the fbi director is reportedly gonna resign this is a perfect shirt
[51:58.120 --> 52:02.200]  because they try to intimidate people and say there's no free speech to talk about hillary well
[52:02.200 --> 52:09.560]  the shirt is available at infowarstore.com and your purchase makes the broadcast possible and i
[52:09.560 --> 52:13.160]  tell you going to all these trump rallies many of you've seen the live feeds or watch the youtube

[55:20.120 --> 55:24.360]  from the american people here it is find the pledge to get on the ballot in the first place
[55:24.920 --> 55:29.160]  amid growing signs that trump may not have the wherewithal to get enough votes on the convention

[55:56.760 --> 56:03.560]  does not dare steal the popular vote from the people according to one party operative i spoke
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.880]  to a couple weeks ago republican national committeeman named curly holgren the popular
[56:07.880 --> 56:11.800]  vote doesn't matter at all it's the delegates who really pick the nominee regardless of other
[56:11.800 --> 56:17.320]  citizens in their states voted the delegates are not bound they're free to vote their conscience
[56:17.320 --> 56:23.160]  on on all issues before the convention and on the nominations anything is possible because the
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.040]  convention of the republican party is the highest authority of the party and they can do anything
[56:28.040 --> 56:32.440]  they want nowhere is the party more in control than in holgren's home state in north dakota
[56:32.440 --> 56:36.280]  where the voters are cut out of the process altogether while some states hold primaries
[56:39.480 --> 56:48.680]  until the 70s i mean you never had delegates switching they changed the rules they tried
[56:48.680 --> 56:54.360]  it 1980 they failed now they're back openly saying no your vote doesn't count the party
[56:54.360 --> 56:59.000]  runs everything like in china where the communist party appoints itself because they had guns
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.760]  then they elect a president who they can remove anytime and then when they leave the bullet
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.160]  bureau they bring in usually their kids it's like north korea where it's a redditary
[57:07.160 --> 57:12.120]  dictatorship or the bushes or the clintons where they just pass the power down and that's where
[57:12.120 --> 57:18.280]  we're headed in this country with a huge con game with curly hueland up there with a carnival going

[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:31.880]  it's kind of nerve-racking and tearing your hair out because uh we've got a local election coming up
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:40.040]  for uh the state supreme court and the incumbent it's a republican and they have uh see ads on tv
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.560]  against her because of gay issues and then right after that they play the one of the one that's
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:56.200]  running against her from a lower court that um she uh let some guy off uh had raked an eight-year-old
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:08.440]  girl you know and it's just crazy um the um small line a little item here in leach and they got a
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:15.080]  flag issue out there they won't let the business play the american flag up front of her store
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.360]  because it's public property well let me expand on something for you here uh for a moment that's
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.880]  political correctness if you can make people take the flag down in public property you can take it
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.760]  down anywhere because quote someone's offended by it well it's our country specifically i was
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.000]  asking callers someone to refresh everybody's memory here what's your line in the sand is there
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.560]  any point at which you're gonna done you know you know be through peacefully putting up with this
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:45.080]  and if they're gonna seal elections openly and admit they're doing it and and act like it's no big
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:52.600]  deal what's coming next what does that signify that our climate has entered into john well i don't
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:57.240]  know it seems like that this is going to be the last i guess you call it an election because uh
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:04.120]  if Hillary gets in a globalist win then she'll be a polite i appreciate your call yeah
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.400]  i mean really they are suspending the election if they keep stealing delegates from sanders
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:16.040]  and if they keep stealing them from trump and then if they take the nominations away at
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:27.160]  cleveland where trump's clearly won already then they're suspending the election just because they
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:34.280]  have some farce dress rehearsal ceremonial fake deal doesn't mean it's an election obviously
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.280]  and so it is ceremonial that means they've canceled the real thing and they have a little
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:49.720]  ceremony where we pretend we elect a nominee for the nomination and so a lot of people say well
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.520]  look alex there's been fraud for a long time so what's the big deal yes but they've never been
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:05.720]  out in the open on it this is a huge huge huge huge deal and it's because the general public
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.080]  has been brought up in front of televisions and has their brain waves at a near sleep level
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:17.000]  the general public is in a trance and so even if somebody fell asleep as a patriot 30 years ago
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.880]  they're still not upset they know what's going on yeah global government's here yeah we're being
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.920]  taken over yeah they still the election yeah they're making us take shots yeah my son died from a
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:32.040]  shot yeah my neighbor died yeah our government's funding isis but what do we do because you're
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:40.840]  still asleep it's not real the public is in a trance that's what's happening and so a bigger
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:46.840]  question is how do you get the public out of their trance so they realize that there's even a line
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:52.600]  to be crossed we'll be back i'm alex jones them full wars dot com the backup sites prison planet
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:05:01.480]  dot com stay where the system strike at the root of dehumanization there's no doubt that our country
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:08.440]  is in serious trouble right now and if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:14.520]  well i'll tell you how when the democrats showed their true colors you got angry and you elected
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:19.800]  republicans and then when the republicans showed their true colors you got angry and
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:26.600]  elected democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:33.480]  side were looking out for your best interest you acted like they were crazy but the real definition
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:41.080]  of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results that's why
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:48.840]  it is vitally important that you wake up america and break the matrix info wars dot com prison
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:57.000]  planet dot tv and the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]  so
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:19.080]  you
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:48.720]  I win Louisiana, I'm speaking in front of thousands of people for a week, I win and
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.880]  I get fewer delegates than he's got.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:57.440]  It's not fair, folks, it's not fair because I'm the outsider and what they do is they
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:01.840]  want to knock out the outsider because they want to keep their little party going and
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:09.680]  the reason our country owes 21 trillion, not billion, trillion dollars.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.400]  The reason we owe all of this money is because of the system.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.600]  So here's what we've got to do, we're going to win so much.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.680]  What you have to do is go out and vote, get everybody.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:26.360]  Whether you love Donald Trump or hating, in the 241 years of U.S. history, there's never
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.920]  been an election where someone is way ahead and has doubled the delegates and they said
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920]  they're going to take it away from them.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920]  It's never been done.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.240]  They've had contested nominations where it's neck and neck, they've had contested nominations
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:45.740]  where they're pushing a Supreme Court nominee, like 1980, but to come out and do this in
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:52.440]  front of everyone and then take delegates from Bernie Sanders, they created super delegates
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:58.400]  that manage the delegates, take their votes and then cheat it.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.840]  And they think the public isn't smart enough to get it.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.160]  And I'll tell you, the public's somewhat upset, but not as upset as they should be.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.920]  How do we get the people out of a trance?
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.360]  How do we get them to get upset?
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.880]  Because even when they know this is going on, they just go, well, we have a corrupt government,
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880]  that's what they do.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.260]  The government's trying to gear up to see your kids belong to the state.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.260]  You never retire.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.920]  They can take your pension fund.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.640]  They can put you in forced labor camps.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.040]  They can, I mean, is there anything we won't put up with?
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.280]  That's the question.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:32.480]  And I asked that question and I went to the first caller and he was a nice guy and brought
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.800]  up some points, but wouldn't tell me.
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.880]  And I see the callers here.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.440]  And I'm not mad.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:45.160]  It's Trump and Ron Paul Feud, libertarians work together.
[01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.840]  Trump is getting the nomination, election fraud, that person's calling in.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:53.920]  Christopher, political correctness, Todd, how to connect with info wars, wants to put
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.920]  up a billboard?
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.920]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:56.920]  We'll talk to you, Todd.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:07.400]  Frank, North Carolina, is there really a choice, a lead is doing what they have to do?
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.160]  No one is calling in on the questions I had.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.280]  The fundamental, and that's fine.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.080]  I think that's cute.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.080]  No one ever does.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.720]  And that's kind of how the American people are.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.840]  It's just kind of wandering around and what, I mean, I don't screen your phone calls and
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840]  I'm glad you called in.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.440]  I'm going to you, but is there a line of the sand?
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.080]  Is there anything you won't put up with?
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.320]  Do you feel safe knowing the government's run by foreign interest that have hijacked
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:42.000]  the country and are signing us on to thousands of trillions, not 21 trillion, the national
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.640]  debt, thousands of trillions?
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.840]  These people make Bernie Madoff look like an angel.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:53.760]  Is anyone upset?
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.200]  Because I want to come up with the meme of, is it the big steal?
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.380]  Is it the elections been canceled?
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:04.160]  Is it America has been basically ended?
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.480]  Is it this, is the end of America?
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.200]  Is this the end of us voting and having our own government?
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.560]  Because that's where we've gotten here, folks.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.000]  And if we can't even recognize the fact that we're on our knees, we have no way of ever
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  standing back up again.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.760]  All right, I'm going to go to each caller, give you each of my Domenic, because I want
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:23.760]  to get to everybody.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.320]  Frank in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.320]  Go ahead.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.880]  Alex, I mean, do they really have a choice, these globalist as you call them, these leads?
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.280]  I mean, you've read the papers.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:40.280]  You know that there are limited resources, there's too many people, they're killing us
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.960]  because they have to, they don't want to, they're really not bad people, they're doing
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.880]  what they have to do for sustainability.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:54.040]  They've weaponized the food, the water, the media, education, everything against us to
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:11:00.240]  control us while they're afflicting us with all these ailments and whatnot to make us
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:03.120]  more controllable, more malleable.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:06.320]  And I mean, aren't they really just doing what they have to do?
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.960]  Trump, I mean, maybe the problem they have with Trump is maybe he is not signed on.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.960]  Maybe he's not aware of their agenda, the depopulation agenda, and maybe he's not signed
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.960]  on to it.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.960]  Well, maybe Donald Trump is.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.960]  Yep, it's very possible.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.600]  Well, let me just tell you, he is, he is, okay, and I'm not a liberty to get into it,
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.280]  but your kid takes a shot, things don't go too well, you start getting informed, I'll
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.800]  just stop right there.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.920]  Look, that is the rest of the story.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.880]  Once they're nakedly stealing the election, it's part of the global government.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.960]  They believe they're saving the earth, bringing in tyranny, and then doing an emergency operation
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.800]  to start culling the population.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:53.160]  It's the perfect excuse for them to take over and rule the whole planet and play God.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.160]  That's what they're doing.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:58.840]  And I don't agree with the fact that there are gods and they're the rulers and they have
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.600]  a right to do this by deception and by stealth.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.360]  I'm here trying to warn people.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.080]  But then I see a population that doesn't care and won't wake up even as they're being
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.600]  killed and I think, my God, they don't even want to be saved.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:21.720]  But then I realize they have been induced into a trance by television and by the culture.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.920]  They say in their own papers that they've engineered everything, the media, everything
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]  to her.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.880]  But if you're aware of the engineering, then it can't affect you anymore.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.800]  They haven't gone far enough to totally shut us down yet.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.320]  If people wake up to the full spectrum and admit it's there, then we can start changing
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.440]  course and have a real debate.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.040]  But people need to know there's sterilence in the plastic, in the money, in the food,
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.040]  in the water.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.040]  It's all declassified.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.320]  There's cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.120]  They are giving us shots to cause pancreatitis and cause diabetes.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120]  Type one.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.160]  I mean, they are attacking us, folks, and I'm not going to just sit here and sign on
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160]  to it.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.320]  I'm not going to go join the globalists, even if the public is so stupid that they don't
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.320]  wake up.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:13.320]  I cannot join this evil plan because I have a soul and I'm not going to be part of this.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.920]  Go ahead.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:21.200]  Yeah, well, I've not been asked to join.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.840]  So I've never had to make that decision.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  I don't.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:24.840]  It's not even they ask you to join.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.840]  They go, globalism is to help the poor and we're going to take our wealth and give it
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.360]  to the poor and industrialize them to stop their overpopulation.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.000]  And then you actually read their more internal documents like the Royal Commission.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.240]  It's like, no, we're causing overpopulation to ruin everything.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.200]  And then the public will call for extermination and we don't want to industrialize other countries
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.800]  because that'll make them have less of a population, but then they'll be independent.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.680]  So we actually want to hurt them.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.640]  It's just pure evil.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:54.640]  Do everything under the guise of helping the poor, the children, the innocent, the downtrodden,
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.120]  the minorities and to keep us safe.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:02.640]  And they control the terrorists and they're the ones who are making everybody sick.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:03.640]  And that's right.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:09.080]  And the gullible lottery ticket society wants to see the talking heads say, I love you.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.440]  The government loves you.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440]  We want to help you.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.560]  Just like black Americans love Obama on average, even though he doubled their taxes, even though
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.680]  Hillary calls them animals and says they should feel like dogs and says that they're
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.680]  super predators.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:26.520]  They love the woman, the protege of the Grand Dragon because they want to believe it's all
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.640]  going to be okay.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.040]  They're dreamers.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.040]  Just like everybody else.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040]  It's white black.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.040]  It doesn't matter.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:37.560]  Childlike arrested development brought up watching Sesame Street in front of a television.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.760]  They have no idea what hit them.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.880]  So those of us that don't want to sign up to being part of this mass operation, what
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.360]  do we do?
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:48.640]  By the way, most people who are even aware of it aren't going to be given entry into
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.920]  this moon raker, uh, Kingsman, uh, scenario.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.440]  Yeah, it's beyond moon raker.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  I mean, this is so, so sick.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:03.640]  I mean, I would have a lot more respect for them if they just would just kill us and just
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.640]  do it, uh, like, you know, you know, they want to use us in the final phases to build
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.600]  their technocracy, put in all their robots and then keep our best and brightest on small
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.560]  reservations, still not aware of the major plan, producing original ideas for them.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.320]  They farm us, right?
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:25.120]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.360]  Trump doesn't like the fact that we, that China has 30 plus percent tariffs on us and
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.360]  we don't.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360]  He says, get rid of it.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.320]  They hate him because he loves America.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.320]  He's not a globalist.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:41.720]  Why, frankly, he's an old fashioned, aggressive, right wing nationalist and he's dangerous,
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:48.480]  I'll take a dangerous, original man versus this synthetic globalist, whatever it is,
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.720]  break away civilization, mad scientist, crazy town.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:57.080]  We'll be back with more calls, Todd, Christopher, Terry, Jeremy and others.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:01.240]  Clean pure drinking water, you can't survive without it, but where do you get it?

[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.680]  Board.
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:05.680]  I use them all.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.680]  They're phenomenal.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.680]  They work.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.680]  Buy them, folks.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:09.680]  Thank you, brother.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.680]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.560]  I am a relatively short time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.560]  products.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560]  Welcome.
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560]  Welcome to the info war.

[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.920]  at the same time.

[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.720]  Right.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720]  That lady has a question.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.720]  Have they worked for you?
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.560]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560]  What products are you taking?
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.560]  Are you taking?
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:42.880]  Everything from SuperMail to Brain Force to Winter Sun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.600]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to auto-fill.

[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:29.600]  What in the wide, wide world is going on here?
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:37.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:49.840]  By the way, Friday I was eating a sub sandwich that had kind of hard white bread on it and
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:53.320]  I just chomped into my tongue a hole all the way through it.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.240]  So I have a bit of a list today.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.960]  Thank you for putting up with me.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:03.040]  The swelling should hopefully go down in the next few days, but that's why I'm talking
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.960]  a little bit more of a list than I normally do today.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.720]  So I apologize to the listeners for that.
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:12.280]  I almost didn't come in because of it, but there's so much news I wanted to.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:19.480]  I want to go back to your phone calls right now and try to hurry through them, but that
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:25.640]  last caller had so many powerful, powerful points to say, hey, guys, my phone system
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:29.440]  crashed and brought up another phone system.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.960]  So I'm not quite sure what to do on that, but if you guys just punch it up on another
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]  computer, there it is.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.520]  It just popped up for me.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.400]  These digital phone systems are great as you can take like 20 calls at a time, but sometimes
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.840]  they have little glitches.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.240]  I've asked the listeners, what's your line in the sand?
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.280]  And nobody was calling in with that, but but now we do have some folks that are calling
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.960]  in about what is your line in the sand and bigger than that when they openly said they're
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:59.960]  going to steal an election and go, your popular vote never counted and act like we're crazy.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:02.920]  Doesn't that telegraph to you and everybody else they're getting ready to really do a
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.720]  lot of other wild stuff and what do you think that is?
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:11.280]  So what's your line in the sand and what do you think the next shoe to drop is?
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:19.640]  And shouldn't we all go to Cleveland to be part of this history and meet fellow humans
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:25.480]  who don't just support Trump, but who support the electoral process and not having the party
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:31.480]  tell us they decide who wins and who loses.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:35.880]  Thank God we're forcing them out in the open to openly steal it like this.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.040]  In the past, they did it with voting machines and on the ground.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:44.760]  Now because there's so many eyes on the voting machines and so many audits and so many lawsuits,
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:48.720]  they're having to do it big in front of the whole world.
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.440]  So I shouldn't be negative about this.
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:54.560]  This is very, very positive.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.120]  Chris says he's gone past his line of the sand, going to the convention.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.520]  Flyboy says 9-11 was his line of the sand, we're going to him in a moment.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:05.400]  Jeremy in Texas was talking about Trump and Ron Paul Feud, libertarians work together,
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.400]  he says.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.920]  Terry says Trump is getting the nomination.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:15.680]  Okay, well, we'll see what he has to say and many, many others.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.320]  We got Corrine in Minnesota, she has a line of the sand.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:25.160]  Chris wants to talk about political correctness and then Todd wants to talk about connecting
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.960]  with them for worse.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:27.960]  Let me do this.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.280]  Let me just get Todd out of the way and then I'm going to go to folks who want to talk
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.280]  about their line of the sand here today.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.880]  Todd, you want to know how to get in contact with us to put up a billboard?
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.880]  Go ahead.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880]  Yeah.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.880]  How's everybody doing?
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:40.880]  Good brother.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:49.400]  Some of us are not much, man, a little starstruck, but real quick, not many of us have the same
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.400]  gift that you do.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.400]  I do not have a gift.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.360]  I have a list with a hole in my tongue, sound like an idiot.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.360]  No.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:01.320]  I try to do my best as far as spreading the word goes and I listen to you every day driving
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:08.560]  home and I'm trying to put, and I think, what can I do, what can I do, what can I do?
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:12.440]  Everybody I talk to just seems completely blind to what's going on and if I could get,
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.080]  you know, I've looked it up and I've called different companies and if I can get even
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:22.840]  10 people to contribute $100 a month with me, you know, in my area, we would have enough
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.080]  to put up a billboard, but the problem is connecting with.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.200]  You know, that's a great idea and I appreciate your call.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.640]  We should create an activism page.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.960]  It's real simple on InfoWars where people can meet to have a demonstration about the
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:40.320]  second amendment or property rights or homeschooling or whatever the case is, but also to pull resources
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:45.240]  to engage in different activities to warn the public.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:48.960]  But don't get down because half the public is in a trance.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.400]  They don't count their brain dead, their victims, their zombies.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.960]  They're pretty much dead already.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:58.000]  You might be able to wake them up down the road, but probably not.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.040]  It's the awake people that have to get organized and not go along with things.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:08.360]  It was Thomas Jefferson that I'm paraphrasing, said it doesn't take a majority to prevail,
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.480]  but only an irate, focused, tireless minority.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:18.000]  The problem is we've had a minority of globalists taking over with fraud and deception.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.480]  We have to have a minority of liberty lovers of every race, color, and creed who way out
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.760]  number the globalist 50 to one, but we're showing minority to stop submitting, stop
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:36.360]  going along with them, stop, stop following their ideas, exposing them, resisting them.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:41.400]  Now Rob do on the road has already seen two info wars billboards when he's been in Wisconsin
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  and Illinois.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.860]  They're all over the country.
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:48.040]  People are putting them up their own designs, their own graphics, whether it's white paint
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.240]  on the side of a barn or your grandma's got an old billboard that she doesn't lease anymore.
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.160]  Get her to let you get up there and paint something on it or whether you got money to
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:01.640]  put up your own, just do it and all the new voriche, all the new wealthy, all the upper
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  middle class.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.880]  If you don't start spending money and getting in the arena and having hope and getting involved,
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.400]  we're going to lose everything.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.800]  Laying down will absolutely devastate you.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:22.760]  Spend money and time and energy now like you did in the free market or lose the free market
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:29.160]  and what you've got left, you're going to have to defend your success now.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.680]  America was the least collectivist country in the world.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.080]  That's why all the collectivists came here because we had so much wealth.
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.440]  Now they've taken over.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:41.640]  They've gained everything and we're in trouble, but it's okay because that's the animating
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:43.840]  contest of Liberty.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.480]  Let's talk to Chris.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.480]  Chris is in Indiana.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.800]  Chris, what's your line of the scene?
[01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800]  Go ahead.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.280]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.280]  Go ahead.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.280]  Thank you.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.480]  Well, I've been around Paul Supporter for a long time.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.680]  That was my line of the stand when they stole that election from him in 2012.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.960]  I've just been handing out inforce signs, putting them on people's doorsteps here.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.720]  My apartment complex have been, I've been putting up inforce bumper stickers all around
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:17.360]  like I'm speeding the signs and everything.
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.840]  I'm just sick of it, man.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:24.120]  I got one thing to tell you though, I wanted to go a little bit over the... I think that
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:27.600]  Trump is easily going to get over 1,300 delegates.
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.520]  Like you've been talking about today about them stealing the election, I highly believe
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:37.240]  that he's not going to win Wisconsin, but that's going to be... It's not going to be
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.200]  very important because then you have a follow-up in New York, which is 95 delegates, winner
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:48.000]  take most, and then you've got a big Super Tuesday up in Northwest... Sorry, Northeast
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.280]  USA, and it's got Pennsylvania, which he's probably going to win.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:59.520]  All these... Then when it comes down to June 7th, he's got New Jersey and California.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:05.160]  California has 172 delegates, winner take all, New Jersey with him and that Chris Christie
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.520]  and Norseman 51 delegates, winner take all.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:16.480]  I think he'll easily get to 1,300, it's just the fact that then these Republican people
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.560]  like Ren's Previous and all that, they might change the rules and all that.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.560]  That's the problem.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.880]  They're already talking about changing the rules because it's their party.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880]  It's their country.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.120]  Your votes belong to them, not you.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]  Their votes count.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]  They have a magic wand.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.320]  They pulled out of, you know, where, and so they can wave that and ignore it, but also
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:39.240]  they're siopping, taking state C1 to make people think, oh, I can't vote for him now.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.640]  They're just going to steal it, so people don't vote for Trump.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:44.560]  So you're absolutely right, siop on top of siop.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.560]  Thank you, Chris.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.520]  Flyboy, Jeremy, Terry, Corrine, Christopher, and others.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.520]  Stay with us.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520]  We're coming right back to your calls.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.800]  This is InfoWars and our reporters are popping in from the Trump Trail.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.800]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:58.800]  Good, brother.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:28:59.800]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.800]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800]  Me and my wife both use them.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:06.000]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.400]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.480]  I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:17.280]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:19.280]  of using synthetic chemicals.

[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:28.960]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, they've got a ton of money there.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.640]  Just from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet, and then concentrated or
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640]  maximum potency.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:40.280]  They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that up for a
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.720]  while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.600]  going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting, and I love it.

[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:38.080]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:42.440]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:47.880]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.640]  quality lab standard.
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.200]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:55.160]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.640]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:01.560]  Secret 12, infowarslife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:06.880]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:07.880]  by the body.
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:12.680]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.400]  known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:20.120]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.280]  form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:31.000]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.240]  the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:38.640]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:40.720]  No needles, no injections.
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.240]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.720]  Try it for yourself.
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.720]  Discover the secret.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:45.720]  Secret 12.

[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:17.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  Crashing.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:27.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:34.640]  I have a lot of frustration, I'll be honest with you, because it's surreal.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.280]  World government's being announced, it's private, corporate, above the law, doesn't
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:43.200]  pay taxes, it's anti-family, it thinks it's God, it thinks it's going to merge with machines
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.840]  and become God, it says humans are a disease, we have to be exterminated, the perfect cover
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:54.320]  for the elite to basically run around and act like psychotic killers.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:58.920]  Because most elites turn into that in history without this God complex that they're saving
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.320]  the earth from overpopulation.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:06.400]  And then I have to sit here while it's all unfolding and try to convince the public why
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.120]  it's wrong that now the popular vote doesn't count because they have a straight face on
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:18.840]  TV saying it's no big deal trying to sell it.
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:23.200]  And then I look at how things have degenerated, I ask myself what's coming next, what's the
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.080]  next shoe to drop?
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:30.320]  I'm going to go to Christopher in North Carolina and Corrine and Terry and Devin and Jeremy
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.720]  and Flyboy before the broadcast ends, in fact Flyboy in New Orleans here in just a moment
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.920]  on what is your line in the sand?
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:43.560]  But he'll be with us for the next 25 minutes till the broadcast ends, on the ground following
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.960]  a Donald Trump rally, he'll tell us exactly where he is, he's somewhere different every
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.800]  few hours, Rob do with crew and he'll be taking calls with us as well, Rob do and we've also
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.920]  got Kit Daniels there, what have you been witnessing since I last talked to you Friday?
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.800]  Well we've gone to, we hit three Trump rallies Alex, this is Rob do reporting from West
[01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:08.880]  Alice, Wisconsin, this is Nathan Hale High School, Donald Trump is going to be speaking
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.240]  in the gymnasium, Trump supporters have been here since 9am, this is where the line was,
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.120]  Alex I have three amazing interviews from veterans talking about their horror stories
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:25.160]  working with the VA, one veteran because he was denied treatment, had to go to a hospital,
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:32.440]  over $4 million in debt now, another veteran, he's actually still active Navy, he is fighting
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:37.080]  to see his kids and he's basically talking about the secret war on the family, I've got
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.120]  12 minutes of him talking about that, so we got a lot of smiling faces here out to see
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.800]  Donald Trump alive now guys and everybody here is very nice, there is a small group
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.200]  of protesters which I'll go back to, what was that about Hilary?
[01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:57.720]  Hilary, yeah your big Hilary fan, yeah we're live right there, so a lot of Info Wars fans,
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:03.880]  a lot of people saying hi, how do we say hi to Alex, hi Alex, what's up Alex, hey guys,
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.000]  a lot of fans here Alex, it's amazing, I've never seen, never gone to a state like this
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.640]  where you can see so many people who know about Info Wars, who are supporters of it
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.640]  and buying the shirts, I talked to a young man at a Bernie Sanders rally who was wearing
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:25.400]  a Hilary Clinton, I gotta tell ya, I've been to the Midwest for business and things, Michigan,
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:32.160]  Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, our listeners are in the Midwest and they are just amazing.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:36.480]  Yeah, I totally agree and it's a little windy now so my hair is all over the place.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:43.120]  It's okay, your hair looks fine Rob do, plus we're mainly radio, but if they remake the
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.920]  Big Lebowski and the other guys too old, you've got the part.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:53.520]  Now seriously, it's a beverage man, a white Russian, seriously though, amazing interviews,
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.360]  what feeling are you getting here on Trump's support in Wisconsin?
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:03.200]  I'm very surprised that the polls are only, that Trump's down by 10 points because every
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:09.280]  rally I've been to is filled with capacity, there's people out the side, we went to Wasaw,
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.240]  Wisconsin yesterday, hey say that again, you're a trailblazer Alex Jones, keep doing what
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.240]  you're doing.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.480]  No, you're a trailblazer brother, what was that guy trying to point out to us just a
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.480]  minute ago?
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.080]  Oh, he was probably trying to point out the small group of protesters that is finally
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.480]  amassed, I think they woke up from their naps after, you know, a night of heavy partying.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.280]  They're being paid by George Soros probably?
[01:37:29.280 --> 01:37:32.680]  Yeah, and he is showing how the mainstream media is set up in front of the protesters
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:36.520]  that look, and this is something I pointed out yesterday, I put out a video, how the
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:40.840]  mainstream media had one protester in their shot, it was only one guy there standing at
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:47.120]  this huge rally where there were thousands, thousands of Trump supporters, at least 1700
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.840]  in the building Alex, and then another thousand, maybe 1200 filling up just listening to him
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:56.520]  inside this mall, okay, they braved the snow, it was, we got three inches of snow.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:01.400]  And they'll put one person in front of the crowd going in and imply that that is all
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.400]  protesters.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.000]  Yeah, and the local media was shooting photographs and they would stage these photographs where
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.760]  there would hardly be any Trump supporters in them, I mean, amazing.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.240]  And by the way, just to be clear, the enemies collapse, the enemy has no credibility, everybody
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:20.880]  hates them, they're just trying to keep the illusion up so us individually feel like we're
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.160]  still alone, Rob, I think the fact that they're having to steal the election publicly or they're
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:31.120]  trying to sell that idea shows just how weak they are, this is not a position of strength.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.760]  Look at this, look at this, you can't even see the back of the line and this line's been
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:38.400]  going in to the building for at least 30 minutes now, okay.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.320]  And let me stop here because a lot of people just tune in, we're mainly a radio show but
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.280]  we also simulcast TV and doing it for about 16, 17 years, we pioneered it so that folks
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:50.440]  can actually see this because in the past, I'd have a reporter on, they'd say there's
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.000]  thousands here for Trump and the media would just say we were liars.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.960]  Exactly, well, they can't say it anymore because we've been putting out massive amounts of
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.320]  videos every day, going to different cities, just exposing the fact-
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.720]  Rob, I want to go to calls and I want to keep you on and I want to talk to some of the Trump's
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.560]  enemies in the next segment to see if they're able to talk because most of them can't form
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:10.560]  syllables.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:14.200]  But first off, what is your line of the sand with the globalists?
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.360]  I mean, we're not calling for physical action but MSNBC implies we're terrorists because
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.200]  we say they'll protest in Cleveland so they don't steal the nomination from Trump or anybody
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.320]  else.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.080]  What is your personal line of the sand?
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.720]  Well, I'm definitely looking forward to going to Cleveland.
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:33.000]  I think the people have spoken that they want to see Trump as a Republican nominee and whether
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.960]  it's against Hillary or Bernie, that's for the Democrats to decide.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.160]  But we've seen this as gang-like activity we're up against at this point right now.
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:46.400]  We're facing gangs of Republicans and gangs of Democrats who aren't accepting the will
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.400]  of the people.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.920]  They're literally stealing it from both sides.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:55.440]  And I'm not a Bernie Sanders supporter by any means but he's having the election stolen
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  from him.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.440]  Absolutely.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.360]  And it's out in the open and they're trying to spin it like weird, weird, like you didn't,
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:03.720]  you always knew your vote didn't count.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:06.240]  Stop acting like it did, you conspiracies.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.080]  It is crazy.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.520]  I want to walk over in a moment to the anti-Trump two or three people.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:19.640]  But first off, Fly Boy in New Orleans, you're on the air with Alex Jones and Rob Do.
[01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.640]  Go ahead Fly Boy.
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:30.120]  Yes, sir, my line in the sand was 9-11 and I think every patriot out there who should
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:37.400]  have already crossed this line in the sand, both parties are corrupt, they're both criminal.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.680]  And if it looks like they're going to lose control, they will physically assault you.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:48.120]  My question to you is this, sometimes we have to think outside of the box in order to win.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:55.960]  The anti-establishment Republican is Trump, the anti-establishment Democrat is Sanders.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:01.440]  Now both of these two people can unify on two important issues.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:07.040]  Number one, the banks, Fractional Reserve Banking, the Federal Reserve Bank equals
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.040]  enslaved-
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.640]  And on the bad trade deals.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:10.640]  Exactly.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:11.640]  And also-
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:17.040]  And imagine if they both unified around, don't steal the election from us and started really
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.320]  bully pulpitting that, but Sanders isn't really talking about how he's been robbed,
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.680]  which makes me think he may be a ringer, but that is a great point, great idea.
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.040]  Rob Do, what about Fly Boy's idea?
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.160]  Well, you know, I was actually talking to people, but I liked his line in the sand.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:35.200]  I caught the first part of that where he said 9-11 was his line in the sand, and I guarantee
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.200]  you that's mine.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:39.480]  When I say line in the sand, though, is when the gloves come off.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.880]  Anybody tries forced inoculation, or any of this, or they announce they're arresting
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:48.200]  all the patriots, and we've got to go to a FEMA camp where potbellied socialists stomp
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:49.200]  our guts out.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.200]  It's game over.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.200]  Right.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:53.240]  And we're not going to let it get to that.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.280]  It's not going to get to that because there's too many people who are awake.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:01.320]  I mean, just looking at this crowd, you know, and I think there's, these people are on different
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.040]  levels of being awake, but they know they're being screwed by the current system.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.840]  They know their jobs were shipped overseas.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:09.400]  They know they're being told their vote doesn't count.
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.120]  They know the border's wide open.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:15.960]  Even all the way up in Wisconsin, one of the biggest issues is the border.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:18.880]  One of the biggest issues here is the border, all the way up here in Wisconsin.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:21.960]  We are thousands of miles away from the Mexican border.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.960]  That's right.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.760]  I want to know why we're losing our liberties in the middle of the country.
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:30.160]  They're taking our freedoms away and spying on us, but the borders are wide open and they're
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:32.600]  flying refugees in without IDs.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.720]  I mean, come on.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:34.720]  Great point, fly boy.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.280]  We're going to come back with Rob Dube, get him to pop in and talk to some of the anti-Trump
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.680]  people if they're able to talk.
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.000]  Man, I'm serious.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.720]  Some of them, I'm not sure they have opposable thumbs, and then we're going to also go to
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.400]  Christopher, Corrine, Terry, and Jeremy straight ahead.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:55.000]  I see Kit Daniels is there as well, reporting with great articles from FullWars.com.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  He may pop in as well.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  Yeah.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.960]  First of all, I want to say, Secret 12, that's two SuperMail, BrainForce, Prostagart, Silver
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:03.960]  Bullet.
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:04.960]  I use them all.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:05.960]  They're phenomenal.
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:06.960]  They work.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:07.960]  I am Paul.
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:08.960]  Thank you, brother.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:09.960]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.520]  I'm a relatively short-time listener, and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:17.520]  Welcome to the InfoWare.
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.320]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWare at
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:23.320]  the same time.

[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.320]  Why?
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.320]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.320]  Have they worked for you?
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.840]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840]  What products are you taking?
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840]  Are you taking?
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:40.280]  I'm a SuperMail to BrainForce, to Wintersun, X2.
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.200]  Even got a little DNA force, so when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Auto

[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.600]  Hey, everyone.
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:01.360]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.600]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.880]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:10.480]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.960]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:19.240]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:21.880]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.200]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:29.520]  vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional

[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.560]  capsines you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:35.200]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.000]  enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.480]  agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.800]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:56.160]  Now available at infowarsteam.com, that's infowarsteam.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:01.920]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:03.520]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.000]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.200]  devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.960]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.640]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:25.200]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:27.600]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:33.060]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:38.880]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.480]  ever concerning iodine.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.440]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:46.680]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.720]  any optimum health regimen.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:47:17.200]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:32.560]  I'll be back tomorrow, obviously, 11am to 3pm for the weekday show and we'll continue
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:33.560]  on.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.200]  But I'm trying to go back to your calls right now and have a Rob do finish up as well.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:46.280]  One sad thing, though, is if you go to these Trump rallies, not so much in Arizona or Texas
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.640]  where there's a higher Hispanic population, but when you go to these areas that are mainly
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.960]  60%, 70% white, there's almost no quote minorities.
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.360]  And that's because the media didn't make them feel welcome there, telling folks that
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.560]  Donald Trump hated them and wanted to kill them.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:04.880]  Gallup polls show as high as 70% or higher if Hispanics don't want the border open.
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:05.880]  They're not dumb.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.520]  But they act like what Trump called for was so hateful to create artificial separation.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.200]  Though Trump does pull double digits, what the last presidential candidate for the Republic
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:20.560]  of America has got with blacks and he got the majority of Hispanics in many states like
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:26.880]  Nevada and others in the primaries, still, the media is dividing this country while blaming
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.040]  Trump and his supporters for it.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:33.280]  So it's another sophisticated way they engage in deception.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:39.280]  Rob, I want to talk to some of these anti-Trump people briefly, then I want to go to Corrine
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.280]  and others.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.280]  Rob?
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.280]  Sure.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:47.640]  So I talked to this group right here earlier and I have a video that's gonna go up on YouTube.
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:52.080]  This young lady here seem to be the most articulate of the bunch and so I'll let her explain to
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:56.200]  you why she is here, I guess, against Trump, standing against Trump.
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:57.200]  Go ahead.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.200]  We're live on the air.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.200]  Hi.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.680]  I believe that Trump stands for bigotry and hate and I just don't want any part of that.
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:09.520]  So I'm standing here today because it is my right to have First Amendment speech.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.880]  So I'm standing out here, not necessarily even to change people's minds, but just to
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.880]  let them know that there is an opposition out there.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.600]  Ask her if she admires Rachel Maddow.
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.160]  Who's chanting or really trying to cause commotion, I just want to stand here peacefully
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:25.600]  and- Ask her if she wants to be Janet Reno or Rachel Maddow.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.280]  Where do you get your news from?
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:32.200]  I get it from NPR, almost exclusively the Wall Street Journal and then also the New
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:33.200]  York Times.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.800]  You know, the NPR is funded by the government?
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.800]  Yes, I did.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.800]  And the Rockefellers.
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:41.040]  There's no news source that is truly unbiased and I understand it's very hard to get truly
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.040]  unbiased news.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.040]  Except for Info Wars.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:47.160]  See, this guy said except for Info Wars, he's being truly unbiased.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.720]  Well we like to think for ourselves- Now we're totally biased to tell the truth and understanding
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:51.720]  the history.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:52.720]  We're definitely biased for freedom.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:53.720]  Definitely.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.720]  Definitely.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.720]  Alex, do you have any other questions?
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.000]  I mean, look, you say she's articulate, she just spewed racist bigot.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.400]  Mexico has a border, everybody else has a border.
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.800]  I can't go to China and have a baby for free.
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:06.800]  It's a load of bull.
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:07.800]  I'm sick of her white guilt.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.800]  Give me a break, lady.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:11.400]  What's your view on the wall?
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.800]  I believe that it is not practical.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:17.880]  It's not going to happen and if you- I mean, I know that a lot of Trump supporters are
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.080]  against frivolous spending.
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:22.080]  I believe that that would fall under- Why could Mexico have a wall?
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:24.080]  So you think we should keep our borders wide open?
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:28.520]  No, I believe that there should be progressive reform there as well.
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:32.680]  I don't think we should allow anybody to walk into our country because there are borders
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:33.680]  for a reason.
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:34.680]  Well that's what's happening.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:37.680]  Well, Obama ships them in, you idiot.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:43.880]  Well, Alex, I'm about to lose my voice here.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:44.880]  I understand, Rob.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:47.600]  Well, listen, listen, I know you've been yelling and talking for days.
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.600]  Great job.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.960]  We just heard the government NPR recording back at us.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:53.280]  We can hear that anytime.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.280]  Great job, dude.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:58.280]  Go get some more, you know, reports with some of the other crew, but you're done for the
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:50:59.280]  day.
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.280]  When are you coming back to Austin?
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.280]  I thought you were coming back yesterday.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:10.360]  Well, they scheduled two more Trump events, so the last one, the last one is tomorrow
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.360]  at seven.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.880]  All right, I'm sure your wife and kids want to see you.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.880]  Come on back.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:14.880]  Great job, the crew.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:15.880]  Great job.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:16.880]  That's good.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:17.880]  I'm glad.
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:18.880]  What?
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:19.880]  We're just live on the air.
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:20.880]  Bless you all.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:21.880]  Bless you all.
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:22.880]  Honesty.
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.200]  These people just want to feel good just as they went out and did what the media said.
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:31.480]  Are you aware of how many fabrics you are wearing as more than two and that's a sin?
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:34.640]  Reading the book cover to cover is important, right?
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:35.640]  This guy's just total.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.640]  These are the intents of people.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.640]  I'm going to call that a Bible talking point.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.640]  An amazing group of cooks.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.800]  Alex, I'm sorry I got choked up like that.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:44.920]  I've been staving off a cold being up here in Wisconsin.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:48.880]  Well, being in the presence of a Rachel Maddow clone, that may actually be a real clone,
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:51.280]  but would chuck me up, I mean.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:55.880]  She was surprised to learn that the IRS carries guns and has killed people.
[01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:56.880]  She did not know that.
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.280]  Well, the government loves us.
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:01.280]  Rob, do keep showing us some feeds till the show ends.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.200]  Great job and get some sleep and come on back to Austin, brother.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:05.200]  We miss you.
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.760]  I want to go back to Austin.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:07.760]  Trust me.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.680]  You have done an incredible job with the crew.
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:11.680]  You and Zimmerman and Kit Dales.
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.680]  Great job.
[01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.680]  In fact, let's talk to Kit for one minute and I'm going to go to these calls.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.680]  You have a kits around.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.680]  Kit.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.680]  Go, Kit.
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:18.680]  Kit, give us your quick take.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:19.680]  I want you to witness.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:20.680]  What's going on?
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.360]  Well, Alex, I just got confronted by hostile anti-Trump activists that got most of it on
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:30.400]  tape. I was having a little debate on the side of one of the protesters and trying to
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:37.640]  point out the fact that what they're pushing to be against Trump is collectivism, but racism
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:39.160]  is also collectivism.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:42.800]  And so the man's wife came by and started talking to the lady.
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:45.600]  So I asked her, I was like, well, ma'am, do you have anything to add?
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:52.840]  And he rushed over, almost pushed me, got him in my face, and then was like, no, no,
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:54.240]  she has nothing to say to you.
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:59.640]  I was like, well, sir, it's a public space and I didn't come up to you.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:03.120]  And then she finally agreed over his shoulder to talk to me and she did.
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:08.680]  But what was interesting was the fact that she claimed that Trump wants to ship African-Americans
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:09.680]  to Africa.
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:12.560]  And I asked her, I was like, when did Trump say that, ma'am?
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:15.400]  And she was like, well, it's one of his supporters that said that.
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.840]  And I was like, so how is that attributed to him?
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:20.040]  Oh, that's your headline.
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:26.760]  Trump thinks, thinks, thinks, less thinks, less thinks that Trump wants to ship Africans
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:27.760]  to Africa.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:28.760]  I mean, this shows the distortion.
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.560]  Well, Kit Daniels, great job.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.120]  Get those reports out.
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:33.120]  Wonderful job, gentlemen.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.120]  Thank you.
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:35.120]  All right.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.120]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:37.120]  Yeah.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.120]  He doesn't have an earpiece so he can't hear me.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.120]  Okay.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.120]  I want to go to these final calls.
[01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:41.120]  I appreciate people holding.
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:42.280]  It's a shorter show on Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:45.480]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:46.480]  Don't forget.
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.360]  We have new products and enforce life.com like the vitamin mineral fusion fruit punch
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:59.400]  flavor, totally high quality, organic, non GMO plant derived, simply amazing.

[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:21.680]  And then Hillary for President original shirt is back.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.040]  We've updated it so that it's a new collector's edition, but it basically looks like the old
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:28.480]  bestseller back by popular demand.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.640]  Hillary for President T-shirt back and your purchases funds the operation.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:36.600]  Let's go ahead and talk to Corrine in Minnesota.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:37.600]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:38.600]  Go ahead.
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.600]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:40.600]  Hi.
[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.600]  Thanks for your great show.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.600]  I love it.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:43.600]  I'm a pretty new listener.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  Thank you.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:49.760]  And regarding the line in the sand, I should I answer that or just ma'am, go ahead.
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:55.920]  I well, for me, it was Black Lives Matter when they came to Minnesota.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.080]  And that's my line in the sand.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:03.440]  But I think anything, any corruption and all of this is pure corruption is a line in the
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  sand for me.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:05.440]  I'm not walking.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  Excuse me.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:07.440]  I'm out of breath.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.440]  It's okay.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:09.440]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:12.920]  And on top of that, when we say line in the sand, we don't even mean violence.
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:17.200]  We mean waking up, getting involved, being fed up, maddened, angry, not going to take
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:18.200]  it anymore.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.200]  Right.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:23.400]  As soon as Black Lives Matter came to Minnesota, I wasn't going to take it anymore.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:24.400]  So what?
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:28.400]  And as far as this Republican party corruption, I mean, I'm there.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:32.360]  We're organizing in Minnesota already to head out there with your group.
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.680]  So put it together, build it.
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.760]  They will come.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:40.800]  And other than that, I think the answer is just, I think we can reach people.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:43.520]  We can't educate a lot of the...
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:44.520]  Absolutely.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.080]  The most important thing to do is to go out and find, quote, so-called minorities, educate
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:52.360]  them about the globalist operation and bring them in and bring them into the libertarian
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:54.640]  patriot movement and say, you're wanted.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.000]  And by the way, we found that with our crews all over the country.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.440]  It's a love fest between the Black Lives Matter people that are just paid off to be there
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:05.000]  but don't know why they're there and the Trump supporters who hug them, who explain
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.480]  things to them and say, look, we're not out to get you.
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:10.960]  And that people start crying when they realize it's all a big lie.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:14.320]  This is a small group of manipulators putting out this info.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.800]  Kareen, God bless you.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:17.480]  Christopher in North Carolina.
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.480]  Go ahead.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.080]  Christopher, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.080]  Welcome.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.760]  Hey, that college gone.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:27.600]  Let's go to Jeremy in Texas.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.440]  Jeremy in the great state of Texas.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  In FEMA region six.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:31.440]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:32.440]  Hi.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:35.040]  My mental line in the sand is in the Fed.
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.080]  My physical line in the sand would be foreign troops on the streets after a nuclear false
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.080]  flag.
[01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:44.840]  Well, I'm really worried about a nuclear false flag with Obama hyping nuclear attacks.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:46.840]  Have you been noticing that?
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.280]  I worry about it every day.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:52.560]  And the way the memes are showing on the news tells me it's brewing.
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:54.160]  It's on the table.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:59.400]  And what I, you know, I originally put that I want to discuss the wrong fall and Trump's
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:04.280]  feud because I feel like this has something to do with the nuclear false flag in the way
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:08.280]  that there's a majority large enough that support Ron Paul that could elect somebody
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:10.160]  like Ron Paul that would be in the Fed.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.160]  That's right.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:15.360]  If Ron Paul got behind Trump, he'd go over the top.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:17.520]  Rand Paul says he'll endorse him if he's the candidate.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:18.800]  Good job, Rand Paul.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:22.360]  The dad is such a purist, though, that he won't.
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:26.040]  And I mean, I need to get Ron Paul on and just, and Ron Paul's, look, he's always been
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:27.040]  a purist.
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.800]  That's why we like him better than Rand, but then Rand's like, hey, lesser or two evils.
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.440]  I get all that.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.840]  Trump is educatable.
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.480]  We can reach out to that's why I'm for Trump.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:39.440]  I'm sorry to Terry, Minnesota, calling back tomorrow.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.440]  I'm out of time.
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:41.440]  Great job, crew.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:58:06.200]  We kick off again tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central and full work.com.
