[00:00.000 --> 00:16.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.640 --> 00:24.760]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[00:24.760 --> 00:30.240]  it's illegal to possess the stolen documents it's different for the
[00:30.240 --> 00:33.080]  media so everything you learn about this you're learning from us remember it's
[00:33.080 --> 00:37.720]  illegal to possess these stolen documents it's different for the media
[00:37.720 --> 00:40.800]  it's different for the media it's different for the media
[00:40.800 --> 00:54.240]  remember it's illegal to possess the stolen documents ladies and gentlemen it is Friday
[00:54.240 --> 01:04.720]  November 8th 2019 why did I begin the broadcast with a clip from the fall of
[01:04.720 --> 01:10.680]  2016 just a month out from the election where 360 days out from the
[01:10.680 --> 01:17.760]  2020 election why because that's the theme of the deep state reading what
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.360]  investigative journalist release makes you a felon and you're gonna go to a
[01:22.360 --> 01:31.840]  forced labor camp I guess and now all over the news AP Reuters CNN they're
[01:31.840 --> 01:40.640]  saying arrest Don Jr send him to prison because when the news was reported
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.680]  on the identity of the fake whistleblower he magnified it so we would
[01:45.680 --> 01:51.320]  discover that the lawyer was a person pledged to run a quote coup against
[01:51.320 --> 01:59.200]  Trump you're supposed to know who a whistleblower is the federal statutes
[01:59.200 --> 02:06.360]  are for the inspector general if the whistleblower doesn't want to be known
[02:06.360 --> 02:12.720]  they don't release the name but a whistleblower on made-up garbage whose
[02:12.720 --> 02:18.040]  name is public who's been testifying to Congress can't face your accusers is
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.920]  totally legal and lawful just like the Supreme Court's ruled dozens of times
[02:23.920 --> 02:29.360]  the last big one in the 1980s that to release the names of jurors if there are
[02:29.360 --> 02:35.400]  especially conflicts of interest say if again John Gotti's son was on the jury
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.320]  you'd want that information that's completely protected and legal and
[02:39.320 --> 02:45.840]  lawful well guess what they're all over the news Washington Post CNN calling for
[02:45.840 --> 02:53.280]  my arrest there are Obama era prosecutors saying I am a criminal arrest me
[02:53.280 --> 03:00.080]  now and the judge reportedly has been talking about me in the courtroom and
[03:00.080 --> 03:03.560]  they're playing clips of me in the courtroom but the press has all been
[03:03.560 --> 03:10.200]  thrown out and they're all scared because this nation has been gilded we've
[03:10.200 --> 03:16.160]  had our testicles cut off and I intend to bring our wave owes back somebody's
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.000]  got to do it bowing down to these people it's got to stop but in the new
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.760]  America run by these people you read WikiLeaks you go to jail you report on a
[03:25.760 --> 03:29.240]  fake whistleblower his name's already out you go to jail you talk about them
[03:29.240 --> 03:34.440]  trying to appoint a Obama department head to the jury which was confirmed you
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.640]  go to jail they think we're so stupid they're gonna get away with this well
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.600]  they're not now we've got all the clips of this coming up but let me drop a
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.080]  bombshell bigger on you I'm not gonna leave the show when we come back not
[03:50.080 --> 03:53.760]  gonna leave the broadcast without it's all over the news that they are trying
[03:53.760 --> 03:57.680]  to arrest me or seeking indictments right now here's the headlines right
[03:57.680 --> 04:02.720]  here Alex Jones threatened to name a Roger Stone juror experts say that
[04:02.720 --> 04:07.000]  might be jury tampering Washington Post no ladies and gentlemen I'm not gonna
[04:07.000 --> 04:14.440]  lead with that because it's important but it's not as important as this I have
[04:14.440 --> 04:20.440]  investigative journalist on the payroll and you know I call this young lady
[04:20.440 --> 04:27.360]  around here the rabbits foot because she just keeps coming up with the gold

[05:00.360 --> 05:04.160]  ask me Alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's
[05:04.160 --> 05:09.280]  because different types of physiology different types of metabolic systems
[05:09.280 --> 05:15.480]  and people will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep
[05:15.480 --> 05:19.560]  earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[05:19.560 --> 05:25.040]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both
[05:25.040 --> 05:29.400]  great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or
[05:29.400 --> 05:34.760]  friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the globalist
[05:34.760 --> 05:39.720]  want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes you
[05:39.720 --> 05:43.400]  sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high-quality iodine
[05:43.400 --> 05:49.640]  info or store.com and help fund the info or info or store.com we've got a huge
[05:49.640 --> 05:53.680]  sale running right now but it's about the end it's the iodine challenge both
[05:53.680 --> 05:58.880]  types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together
[06:01.880 --> 06:10.480]  you are listening to an info wars.com frontline report if you are receiving
[06:10.480 --> 06:15.160]  this transmission you are the resistance
[06:20.040 --> 06:27.960]  from deep in the heart of FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's
[06:27.960 --> 06:31.240]  Alex Jones
[06:31.240 --> 06:46.120]  remember three years ago in a month before the 2016 election Chris Cuomo went
[06:46.120 --> 06:55.120]  on CNN to engage in masher fraud well just hear what he said for yourself
[06:55.120 --> 07:02.520]  remember it's illegal to possess these stolen documents it's different for the
[07:02.520 --> 07:05.400]  media so everything you learn about this you're learning from us remember it's
[07:05.400 --> 07:10.040]  illegal to possess these stolen documents it's different for the media
[07:10.040 --> 07:25.560]  it's different for the media it's different for the media so if you read
[07:25.560 --> 07:30.640]  what investigative journalists legally and lawfully releases protection of the
[07:30.640 --> 07:35.040]  First Amendment that's in all the Supreme Court rulings you're gonna go to
[07:35.040 --> 07:38.120]  prison not just duly an assange and they're showing us what happens to
[07:38.120 --> 07:41.200]  investigative journalists now what would have happened to Daniel Ellsberg
[07:41.200 --> 07:44.560]  exposing the Vietnam War today is being locked up to rot in solitary
[07:44.560 --> 07:51.640]  confinement and now they've come out all over the national news and they've
[07:51.640 --> 07:56.840]  said that they want Alex Jones arrested for pointing out that the judge
[07:56.840 --> 08:01.480]  selected as the first juror in the Roger Stone railroading kangaroo show
[08:01.480 --> 08:06.520]  trial star chamber event aren't afford to describe how fraudulent it is on its
[08:06.520 --> 08:13.760]  face they're all over the news Washington post CNN Alex Jones needs to be
[08:13.760 --> 08:19.720]  arrested Alex Jones is committed a crime says former Obama prosecutors US
[08:19.720 --> 08:27.400]  attorneys trot out on TV arrest him he's threatening the lives of jurors there
[08:27.400 --> 08:31.480]  was a grim reaper on his show yeah talking about Epstein we had a grim
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.680]  reaper on the show these people are unbelievable and what else they say Don
[08:36.680 --> 08:41.120]  jr. needs to go to jail while they're on the view and one host says I my law
[08:41.120 --> 08:48.440]  degree says you go to jail no such thing none of that's true quid pro clothes
[08:48.440 --> 08:53.160]  not illegal as the president talking to a head of a state unless he was
[08:53.160 --> 08:59.880]  personally making money which he wasn't off of it so they're just saying normal
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.960]  activity is illegal if they tried to put Bill Clinton on the jury or Hillary
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.320]  Clinton or Chelsea Clinton or let's say Bill and Hillary Clinton's made
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.280]  somebody they have power over they would be disqualified for the appearance of
[09:15.280 --> 09:22.920]  improperly that's the law but Judge Jackson and all her imperious hubris
[09:22.920 --> 09:32.960]  filled arrogance admonished everyone I guess on Tuesday or was it Wednesday
[09:32.960 --> 09:43.320]  it's Wednesday not to talk about the jury anyone and then they said Jones knew
[09:43.320 --> 09:49.320]  that when an hour later he talked about it no I didn't but she can't sit there
[09:49.320 --> 09:53.440]  and tell the media don't talk about these jurors that's not gonna stand up
[09:53.440 --> 09:57.000]  what if one of the jurors was Bill Clinton hi everybody don't talk about
[09:57.000 --> 10:05.480]  me being on the jury here Don jr. 100% cut and dry could say who the
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.360]  whistleblower is the person's not even a whistleblower but it has that dossier
[10:10.360 --> 10:19.920]  whistleblower intelligence community all royalty
[10:22.800 --> 10:30.720]  so they don't know what to do now they tried to put Politico and Reuters were
[10:30.720 --> 10:36.640]  in the room they said that the spokesperson for the office of budget
[10:36.640 --> 10:40.600]  management under Obama who they said husband works in the Justice Department
[10:40.600 --> 10:46.600]  on the Russia probe as a lawyer that was in the news confirmed we went looked
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.880]  at the only woman that ever headed up the PR there she later went on to head
[10:50.880 --> 10:57.320]  up health and human services as the cabinet head on the cabinet and her
[10:57.320 --> 11:01.600]  husband indeed matched up as a lawyer on Russia probe oh they go oh Jones isn't
[11:01.600 --> 11:04.400]  right we're not gonna tell you who it is we have no idea the whole thing's
[11:04.400 --> 11:09.240]  secret but they did say it is an Obama official and that's perfectly fine the
[11:09.240 --> 11:16.960]  judge said and now for daring to say wow that's terrible and that's reportedly
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.880]  who it is they won't deny it well Jones needs to be arrested and then I can't
[11:21.880 --> 11:26.360]  play all these clips but normally you hear oh Don jr. destroyed the view or no
[11:26.360 --> 11:34.760]  he destroyed them really I'm I'm bad to women whoopee you defend Norman Polanski
[11:34.760 --> 11:39.800]  drugging and raping 13-year-old girls in their rear end still they bleed
[11:39.800 --> 11:48.880]  everywhere shut her down real quick people started chanting and praising him
[11:48.880 --> 11:57.040]  because he called him on it so she said shut up Bayard said this isn't a Trump rally
[11:59.200 --> 12:05.760]  do you have fast their audience turned on them because junior was laughing at him
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.600]  with his good-looking girlfriend smart good-looking girlfriend they didn't know
[12:10.600 --> 12:21.280]  what to do they didn't know how to respond to the hot smart lawyer Latina
[12:21.280 --> 12:27.840]  and her European boyfriend and I'm gonna play some of these clips but it's not
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.360]  our top story wait till I do that next segment but this is who they are all over
[12:32.360 --> 12:38.680]  the news I have a stack of articles arrest him Fox News Bands host from using
[12:38.680 --> 12:47.800]  the name of alleged whistleblower Eric Harvey pronounced his name CIA
[12:47.800 --> 12:55.000]  Sarah Mella Twitter bands it they'll kick you off if you use it
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.560]  Dems fight to keep the name of whistleblowers name private he's already
[12:58.560 --> 13:04.480]  testified his lawyers a guy that swore to destroy Trump all over Twitter here
[13:04.480 --> 13:10.840]  he is Eric Sarah Mella five fat she didn't know oh it's okay for the heavy to
[13:10.840 --> 13:16.440]  have him before Don Jr. or anybody else mean drudge had it we had it but oh
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.200]  arrest him there he is with the first lady right there we're not supposed to
[13:21.200 --> 13:29.440]  talk about this guy that's a lapins crazy wife right there on a circus so
[13:29.440 --> 13:33.680]  that's the control because the media says it's illegal the rest of the media
[13:33.680 --> 13:38.160]  won't touch it to protect these people from exposure that their political hacks
[13:38.160 --> 13:45.280]  that work for Hillary Obama Brennan Clapper Coney Robert Mueller you know I
[13:45.280 --> 13:49.800]  had a former federal agent in the trial that they didn't know about who knew
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.760]  what to look for and he said it's totally rigged he said the feds they
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.960]  have on the stands have openly been paid off and then he felt dirty leaving it
[13:57.960 --> 14:03.640]  and had not seen mafia trials that would the mafia that corrupt he said he
[14:03.640 --> 14:09.040]  literally never felt dirty leaving a courthouse he said the whole top is
[14:09.040 --> 14:11.400]  rigged
[14:14.600 --> 14:20.920]  think about that I like that same source confirmed to me before it was news
[14:20.920 --> 14:26.320]  that Bloomberg is going to run he's already got a security detail set up
[14:26.320 --> 14:33.320]  it's on so when we come back I'll play Bayharr and others saying you're going to
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.520]  jail you're going to prison we'll finish up with this attack on free speech and
[14:37.520 --> 14:42.480]  then I'm gonna get into the big story and and and we're not gonna have the
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.360]  audio of this till the fourth hour I'm gonna go ahead and host the fourth hour
[14:46.360 --> 14:54.560]  today because I was on three-way phone calls this morning and recording phone
[14:54.560 --> 15:08.240]  calls this morning with the crew of the Kentucky state government and they were
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.640]  admitting on the phone how the Democrats stole the election in plain view and
[15:13.640 --> 15:17.040]  this is all in plain view and we have the documents we have the proof but we're
[15:17.040 --> 15:21.840]  putting it all together with the reports with Millie Weaver for the fourth
[15:21.840 --> 15:29.520]  hour and this is all hiding in plain view how the Democrats stole Kentucky how
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.280]  they stole the governor's ship now their their wave of fraud wasn't big enough to
[15:34.280 --> 15:38.440]  pick up the other seats but they got it there targeting the chief executive who
[15:38.440 --> 15:42.160]  can then pardon all the Democrats that have been indicted in the state and that
[15:42.160 --> 15:47.320]  was really their main plan so they had the focus illegal voting done there with
[15:47.320 --> 15:51.720]  the names of dead people and folks off the rolls and we even have the people
[15:51.720 --> 15:54.440]  who had their names stolen and put on the rolls they don't even live in the

[20:00.240 --> 20:21.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:21.840 --> 20:27.760]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who
[20:27.760 --> 20:33.760]  look on and do nothing if you are receiving this transmission you are
[20:33.760 --> 20:39.400]  the resistance we now take you live to the central texas command center it's
[20:39.400 --> 20:42.760]  alex jones
[20:43.760 --> 20:49.440]  you're a lawyer yes and we know each other you were a prosecutor I mean did you
[20:49.440 --> 20:55.600]  advise your boyfriend that it is a federal crime to out I didn't buy some
[20:55.600 --> 20:58.080]  that it was a federal crime but I did come out of the bathroom and say I left
[20:58.080 --> 21:01.920]  you learn for 10 minutes what happened when my mrs. got because it's only a
[21:01.920 --> 21:11.440]  third to do it that's in the statute so that's the line she's not everybody
[21:11.440 --> 21:17.960]  stop it seems it's hard to hear it is a crime it's not accurate just that's
[21:17.960 --> 21:21.720]  great all you want my law degree says it is but nevertheless but he's not the
[21:21.720 --> 21:28.680]  first you did speak to him about that I talked to him no not prior to after I
[21:28.680 --> 21:31.880]  said oh what happens well they're saying that I released this and I outed but if
[21:31.880 --> 21:35.600]  you look at the facts and the facts are that the name was out there I'm not
[21:35.600 --> 21:38.800]  saying okay I understand what you're saying that perhaps okay it wasn't the
[21:38.800 --> 21:42.560]  most prudent decision to retweet an article but I'm going to tell you
[21:42.560 --> 21:46.240]  something we talked about transparency the president of the United States
[21:46.240 --> 21:55.360]  released the transcript of exactly what happened in that phone call
[21:55.360 --> 22:00.920]  or her opinion of what transpired about that yeah that's out there to say he's
[22:00.920 --> 22:09.200]  not trying to hide I'd like to talk about that I don't think I should have to
[22:09.200 --> 22:13.560]  forego my first amendment but if I'm reading an article be like oh the
[22:13.560 --> 22:18.680]  names out there I didn't even realize I don't regret doing it no I don't think
[22:18.680 --> 22:21.800]  I should have to forego my first amendment rights it's out there I read it
[22:21.800 --> 22:25.000]  in an article I've been reading it for a week I saw it on the drug report like
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.280]  this is not some secret but then say because it's Donald Trump Jr. because
[22:29.280 --> 22:34.720]  he's an outspoken guy why was there no outrage when drug report which is a
[22:34.720 --> 22:39.960]  major website probably the largest aggregator of media news in America he
[22:39.960 --> 22:43.320]  puts it out there a few days ago and no crickets no no problem with that
[22:43.320 --> 22:47.440]  because probably not a lot of people knew that it was out there but once you
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.680]  put it out on drugs but here's the ends of people see right I'm saying to you
[22:51.680 --> 22:57.200]  listen man I don't know how many people here read the judge report I don't know
[22:57.200 --> 23:03.280]  but I'm so you got a bunch of arrogant hateful hearties who don't believe in
[23:03.280 --> 23:06.720]  freedom Joy Bay hard days before said we're gonna confiscate all your guns
[23:06.720 --> 23:12.280]  we're gonna lie to you about it once we get in we're taking them you understand
[23:12.280 --> 23:15.320]  we don't care about the freedoms that made this country so great we're gonna
[23:15.320 --> 23:21.680]  flush them down the toilet and then I love how his girlfriend Don Jr. is like
[23:21.680 --> 23:26.200]  well maybe it wasn't the best idea he did it the best idea great job doing it
[23:26.200 --> 23:32.720]  look at this here he is Eric Ceremella five facts you need to know here he is
[23:32.720 --> 23:38.720]  I knew this guy was days before it was the big news we're like oh look he's a
[23:38.720 --> 23:42.400]  little slimy Democrat his lawyer hates Trump and swore to remove him from
[23:42.400 --> 23:47.880]  office in a quote to in 2017 oh look he works for Brendan and under Hillary and
[23:47.880 --> 23:52.880]  Obama and he just repeats the same garbage we have the transcript we have
[23:52.880 --> 23:59.160]  the witnesses it's not true he's nothing but a deep stator and they turned that
[23:59.160 --> 24:05.400]  into it's bad what he's just supposed to testify secretly to Democrats only and
[24:05.400 --> 24:09.480]  then sit his written questions to the Republicans if they have any questions
[24:09.480 --> 24:14.720]  they can they can talk magically to a to his lawyer he doesn't have to face
[24:14.720 --> 24:18.320]  anybody he can just sit there and make this up it's a hundred percent legal
[24:18.320 --> 24:21.520]  and lawful so it's a hundred percent legal and lawful in the interest of the
[24:21.520 --> 24:26.360]  press that I exposed that they were trying to put high-level Obama
[24:26.360 --> 24:30.400]  administration officials on the jury and they were admitting it in the news like
[24:30.400 --> 24:36.760]  it was no big deal Reuters, Politico, Washington Post were reporting that
[24:36.760 --> 24:39.760]  older husband worked at the Justice Department in the Mueller probe as a
[24:39.760 --> 24:45.720]  lawyer what and I'm like who is this
[24:47.720 --> 24:53.040]  is it Robert Mueller he was a lawyer working at the Justice Department a
[24:53.040 --> 25:01.440]  Mueller report I mean that's how crazy this is but that's how dumb they think
[25:01.440 --> 25:05.080]  you are in Fox News and Twitter and all of them won't let their host say who it
[25:05.080 --> 25:13.680]  is because because Joy Behar and others say you need to go to jail if that is
[25:13.680 --> 25:18.000]  the case think about that don't read the WikiLeaks
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.200]  hip-toon to CNN Chris Cuomo's allowed to read it you're not you'll go to jail
[25:22.200 --> 25:29.200]  that's not true that's mafia threats from that goon from Fredo trying to

[34:14.320 --> 34:21.120]  the country to put people on the driver's license roles on to the voter
[34:21.120 --> 34:28.440]  roles and then have judges order those roles officially used then their
[34:28.440 --> 34:32.120]  operatives are given the names and go vote in their names they got caught in
[34:32.120 --> 34:40.800]  kentucky we have the state government admitting it on tape it's all coming up

[34:52.800 --> 34:58.680]  republican moved years ago to south dakota that's how we found out about this
[34:58.680 --> 35:04.840]  her husband is a legal immigrant never voted but when she moved she learned years
[35:04.840 --> 35:08.760]  later that they had been put back on the role she got herself removed she found
[35:08.760 --> 35:15.440]  she was back on and found out she and her husband had voted he never voted but
[35:15.440 --> 35:18.760]  because of the driver's license and then paired they put him back on made him
[35:18.760 --> 35:22.320]  registered democrats so they know when you leave because the state database
[35:22.320 --> 35:25.160]  through the federal database tells you when you're going so they fraudulently
[35:25.160 --> 35:29.440]  know you've left you won't notice they then will put your husband or your
[35:29.440 --> 35:35.560]  spouse on the list and then that's given out to go vote 175,000 were officially
[35:35.560 --> 35:39.560]  forced back on months before the election by the democrat who was in
[35:39.560 --> 35:48.720]  control of that that's coming up fourth hour that's how big this is and it's
[35:48.720 --> 35:51.080]  all going to be breaking huge work that's what they want to solve the year
[35:51.080 --> 35:54.840]  because what they want us arrested that's why the Washington post CNN are all
[35:54.840 --> 35:59.520]  calling Obama administration officials are calling for my arrest and on juniors

[39:51.320 --> 39:54.520]  here I was home having dinner with my family at about 8 o'clock last night
[39:54.520 --> 39:58.640]  they waited for me to get home having some delicious soup that my wife made
[39:58.640 --> 40:05.080]  minestrone and text message comes in and Barnes as well they're trying to get
[40:05.080 --> 40:10.160]  you arrested with federal prosecutors that are Obama appointees right now but
[40:10.160 --> 40:13.120]  it's all fraud and all the lawyers have already turned against him it's
[40:13.120 --> 40:16.360]  obviously a huge hoax but it's very dangerous we talked about 30 minutes
[40:16.360 --> 40:19.960]  about it and they want Don Jr. arrested they want me arrested and then it's a
[40:19.960 --> 40:25.200]  huge criminal hoax of racketeering to intimidate you but they got Fox News and
[40:25.200 --> 40:28.240]  Twitter to not let anybody say the name of the fake whistleblower that openly
[40:28.240 --> 40:31.680]  says he wants to destroy Trump and his lawyer wants to destroy Trump and they're
[40:31.680 --> 40:34.360]  trying to say that they can appoint Obama officials to the jury it turns out
[40:34.360 --> 40:37.800]  some more got appointed that's why the judge is so scared right now they're
[40:37.800 --> 40:40.760]  threatening to try to arrest anybody Barnes explain to people what's really
[40:40.760 --> 40:44.880]  going on here so the everyone has a constitutional right to monitor jury
[40:44.880 --> 40:49.080]  selection to make sure the jury selection process is not producing biased
[40:49.080 --> 40:55.200]  or partial or prejudiced jurors as is enshrined in the Constitution and so as
[40:55.200 --> 40:59.400]  part of that that was the goal in the objective and the what's happened is you
[40:59.400 --> 41:05.360]  have Obama prosecutors and the press and parts of the press labeling that as a
[41:05.360 --> 41:10.800]  criminal act to discuss jury selection to discuss who is being picked to discuss
[41:10.800 --> 41:14.560]  whether that person is prejudiced and biased or is likely to be prejudiced and
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.120]  biased in the jury trial of Roger Stone and it appears that there's an effort to
[41:19.120 --> 41:24.280]  suppress discussion and conversation about what appears to be extraordinary
[41:24.280 --> 41:29.240]  jury selection that is favoring people who have every reason to be hostile and
[41:29.240 --> 41:34.080]  have prejudice against Roger Stone and to be a railroad to give you an idea of
[41:34.080 --> 41:37.480]  the kind of people who have demanded jury selection information be publicly
[41:37.480 --> 41:41.640]  disclosed includes the New York Times who won that right back in the 1960s it
[41:41.640 --> 41:44.400]  includes major members of the press who won it in the Hinckley trial in the
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.560]  early 1980s this has been well established for a long time and yet you
[41:48.560 --> 41:52.960]  have prominent prosecutors Obama connected prosecutors still connected to
[41:52.960 --> 41:55.760]  members of the Department of Justice in the Washington Post saying it's a time
[41:55.760 --> 41:58.280]  to arrest me that that's what's happening I mean you have people saying
[41:58.280 --> 42:02.320]  let's criminalize this in fact what the tweet was from this prominent
[42:02.320 --> 42:06.680]  prosecutor was where is the DOJ expecting the DOJ to just come in
[42:06.680 --> 42:12.160]  Jones is in a criminal territory and is threatening the jurors and then they said like a mafia don't
[42:12.160 --> 42:15.560]  and there's several problems with it first you're always entitled to go into
[42:15.560 --> 42:19.280]  jury selection secondly you're always entitled to review whether the jury is
[42:19.280 --> 42:23.920]  being a fair jury imagine if you couldn't question in the 1960s whether a
[42:23.920 --> 42:27.000]  Klansman was sitting on a trial in a civil rights case or with an African
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.920]  American defendant that's that's effectively what the Obama prosecutors
[42:30.920 --> 42:34.400]  are saying it is dangerous it is precarious it is a threat to fundamental
[42:34.400 --> 42:37.480]  freedoms their attempts to suppress repress and free speech in this country
[42:37.480 --> 42:41.800]  to cover up what appears to be a bad trial that is not going according to
[42:41.800 --> 42:45.920]  constitutional plan and they're doing it in unison everywhere so it's bigger
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.200]  than Roger Stone better than Alex Jones better than Don Jr. what who's behind it
[42:50.200 --> 42:53.400]  how do we stop it and then we're going to get into all the other big news stay
[42:53.400 --> 42:55.560]  with us
[42:58.120 --> 43:02.960]  folks ask me Alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's
[43:02.960 --> 43:07.400]  because different types of physiologies different types of metabolic
[43:07.400 --> 43:14.120]  systems and people will like different formulas it's just that simple x3 is the
[43:14.120 --> 43:18.400]  deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[43:18.400 --> 43:23.880]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both
[43:23.880 --> 43:28.280]  great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.040]  friends bottom line iodine is essential that's why I harp on it the
[43:33.040 --> 43:38.400]  globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons lower IQ makes
[43:38.400 --> 43:42.240]  you sluggish you don't live as long it's simple get your high quality I don't

[43:59.280 --> 44:04.000]  different all of our metabolic systems are diverse some of us are deficient
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.240]  some things and not in others there's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm
[44:08.240 --> 44:13.360]  not telling you something you don't know but I'm here to tell you every time I

[44:58.160 --> 45:04.440]  the Alex Jones show a few days ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.600]  had her digital textbook she said dad they're teaching us about the periodic
[45:08.600 --> 45:13.280]  table and I clicked on iodine and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs
[45:13.280 --> 45:16.920]  are mentally retarded on the planet earth because they didn't get enough iodine
[45:16.920 --> 45:20.600]  that's what you say all the time but I've heard people say you're crazy and
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.600]  it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when I click it
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.000]  saying exactly what you said and I said I know honey that's why I have you take
[45:29.000 --> 45:34.240]  the high-quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so

[45:39.360 --> 45:43.000]  much healthier and smarter than most of the kids your age and it just really
[45:43.000 --> 45:48.160]  blew her away to read it there for herself they know that 2 billion people
[45:48.160 --> 45:52.000]  ladies and gentlemen 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face the

[47:34.600 --> 47:43.680]  Alex Jones it is a crime it's not accurate just ask for it all you went
[47:43.680 --> 47:50.800]  my law degree says it is but nevertheless so you've got Tyronella who's
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.560]  already testified why do they never want to tell you who the original whistle
[47:54.560 --> 47:58.640]  or is because there isn't one they all want to say they heard something that
[47:58.640 --> 48:02.080]  didn't happen they don't want the fact that they're all political hacks to come
[48:02.080 --> 48:05.760]  out that they're all deep staters appointed by Brennan and Clapper and
[48:05.760 --> 48:10.480]  Hillary and Obama and so when it does come out oh look it's this guy whose
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.680]  lawyer says we're gonna stop Trump says we're gonna have a coup on Trump one
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.200]  week after he's in office and then constantly attacks him and the client is
[48:20.200 --> 48:22.920]  constantly attacking him and all the evidence shows it's not true and the
[48:22.920 --> 48:28.320]  quick pro quo is not illegal and then you've got the Army Colonel the Lieutenant
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.080]  Colonel will roll some footage of him coming in to testify again at Congress
[48:32.080 --> 48:35.160]  and oh that's all got to remain secret but now they're getting ready to have
[48:35.160 --> 48:43.120]  some more public hearings of this it's just giant complete and total fraud to
[48:43.120 --> 48:46.680]  say that we should know who they are but again they don't want the scrutiny of
[48:46.680 --> 48:50.520]  who these people are part of our system is you get to face your accusers of
[48:50.520 --> 48:54.560]  people will make stuff up because they don't have to face the music we're
[48:54.560 --> 48:57.760]  being accused they want us in jail because we love America they're
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.880]  demonizing us they're coming after us so Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer
[49:01.880 --> 49:07.440]  shifting gears out of all the intimidation they just keep doing it
[49:07.440 --> 49:11.720]  they're obviously operating like a mafia but we keep hearing about the
[49:11.720 --> 49:15.240]  Inspector General report and the indictments and the fact that the
[49:15.240 --> 49:18.760]  Deputy Attorney General didn't kill the indictment so we know they're out there
[49:18.760 --> 49:23.440]  but why hasn't Trump in the Justice Department moved I mean I think that is
[49:23.440 --> 49:25.920]  a good question and I think it's a good question whether Barr is going to take
[49:25.920 --> 49:28.800]  action because it is problematic I mean there were different people talking to
[49:28.800 --> 49:32.720]  me today and yesterday saying when is this gonna end this weaponization of the
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.600]  law in ways that is dangerous and precarious for the country and political
[49:36.600 --> 49:40.880]  partisan ways intended to punish people for their dissident speech or
[49:40.880 --> 49:44.640]  different ideas about the Constitution and fundamental freedoms and liberties
[49:44.640 --> 49:48.320]  in the country so here for example like jury tampering has a very specific one
[49:48.320 --> 49:51.000]  of the most outrageous things in the Trump era has been the way the legal
[49:51.000 --> 49:55.880]  left has redefined basic criminal terms to mean things that never apply to so for
[49:55.880 --> 49:58.840]  example if you look up extortion there is a criminal definition within the US
[49:58.840 --> 50:02.440]  sentencing guidelines and the statutes for what extortion is it has nothing to
[50:02.440 --> 50:05.560]  do with what happened with Ukraine extortion requires a threat of physical
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.840]  injury to a person or kidnapping that's that's the statutory definition for
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.040]  good cause blackmail requires that you be doing something in exchange to not
[50:14.040 --> 50:17.840]  provide information about someone again that is absolutely nothing to do with
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.840]  what happened in Ukraine in terms of what what the president did and yet you
[50:21.840 --> 50:25.760]  have prominent legal leftist out there on the social media space out there in
[50:25.760 --> 50:28.960]  the media space saying that these crimes were committed now you have this
[50:28.960 --> 50:33.200]  attempts to redefine jury you can't tamper with the jury by questioning how
[50:33.200 --> 50:36.640]  jury selection goes because the jury's already been instructed to not be
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.040]  reading or listening to any media coverage so only if they're violating
[50:40.040 --> 50:44.560]  their oath that they even possibly be under any subject to it so these are
[50:44.560 --> 50:48.640]  just extraordinary interpretations and expansive interpretations intended to
[50:48.640 --> 50:52.280]  criminalize for first amendment activity because they don't want people
[50:52.280 --> 50:55.760]  exposing the degree to which there's corruption and but the just department
[50:55.760 --> 50:59.800]  and everyone allowing this you have the media you have these Obama era people
[50:59.800 --> 51:05.520]  saying arrest Jones arrest Trump Jr when that's a crime to be claiming that
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.880]  your normal first amendment is illegal these people are gangsters and the fact
[51:09.880 --> 51:12.760]  that none of them have gotten in trouble instead we see more and more
[51:12.760 --> 51:16.800]  indictments of Trump supporters as they cut all of his pillars of support out
[51:16.800 --> 51:21.280]  from under him yeah it's a political war unlike anything the United States has
[51:21.280 --> 51:25.000]  ever seen I mean you could go back maybe to the colonial times and the
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.160]  revolution but that's the closest you could get the king had kangaroo courts
[51:29.160 --> 51:31.400]  doing the same thing and that's the Declaration of Independence is one of
[51:31.400 --> 51:33.960]  the reasons we went to war precisely into one of the reasons why we have all
[51:33.960 --> 51:37.080]  these rights we have today to make sure this is done correctly and properly
[51:37.080 --> 51:40.280]  those are checks and balances to stop what they're trying now so they're
[51:40.280 --> 51:44.360]  trying to overturn jurisprudence and the basic rule of law and they're doing
[51:44.360 --> 51:49.040]  it consciously while the judge cackles and snorts well that we do not have
[51:49.040 --> 51:51.680]  start chamber trials in America even though that's what shift is trying to
[51:51.680 --> 51:54.960]  do with impeachment and that's what they're trying to recreate by the same
[51:54.960 --> 51:57.200]  day they're trying to make it like a grand jury where it's secret right
[51:57.200 --> 51:59.880]  exactly the grand jury is secret for different reasons but a grand jury cannot
[51:59.880 --> 52:02.720]  take away someone's freedom a grand jury can only initiate a criminal
[52:02.720 --> 52:06.440]  proceeding and engage in investigative proceedings that are mostly meant to be
[52:06.440 --> 52:10.320]  secret so that a person's privacy is not improperly invaded in terms of the
[52:10.320 --> 52:13.480]  person that's being investigated that's supposed yes and then in court it's
[52:13.480 --> 52:16.920]  public exactly when they're ready to pull the trigger it's great apps everything
[52:16.920 --> 52:20.080]  and that process is public so the particularly the decision-maker when
[52:20.080 --> 52:23.600]  you sit on a jury you're part of the decision-making process and your
[52:23.600 --> 52:26.680]  judgment whether you are biased is something that the public has a right
[52:26.680 --> 52:29.680]  to know whether here's what's happened the Democrats in the deep state all of
[52:29.680 --> 52:32.960]  the world have decided to totally get rid of any pretense that they're not the
[52:32.960 --> 52:37.640]  bad guys and they've always been the bad guys but they're just going rogue
[52:37.640 --> 52:41.600]  going tyrant on every front and you agree with that be how do you think it
[52:41.600 --> 52:45.680]  susses out it's extraordinarily dangerous and at some point both the US
[52:45.680 --> 52:48.400]  Supreme Court and other state Supreme Courts where as appropriate other
[52:48.400 --> 52:52.040]  courts of appeals have to step in and stop this nonsense I mean to see what's
[52:52.040 --> 52:55.960]  happening I mean what I said yesterday is here you have what appears to be an
[52:55.960 --> 53:00.960]  anonymous jury anonymous juries were rare only recent historically and or
[53:00.960 --> 53:05.400]  we're supposed to be for mob cases and terrorism cases not Roger Stone so you
[53:05.400 --> 53:09.400]  are just like we knew Homeland Security Patriot Act it's all being expanded
[53:09.400 --> 53:13.400]  down to everybody exactly it's what happens when you allow any crack in our
[53:13.400 --> 53:16.960]  constitutional liberties it will ultimately erode the foundation just like
[53:16.960 --> 53:20.800]  a damn no exact the whole thing will fall apart and you're seeing it so you're
[53:20.800 --> 53:23.840]  seeing expansion of definition of I mean you're seeing definitions of emoluments
[53:23.840 --> 53:27.000]  and all kinds of legal provisions where they're trying to weaponize the legal
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.560]  system recreate rewrite it's just like they're openly saying yeah we're getting
[53:30.560 --> 53:33.120]  rid of the first amendment for conservatives well that'll get rid of
[53:33.120 --> 53:36.160]  it for everybody exactly you can't do it for one side not do it for the other
[53:36.160 --> 53:39.800]  side and as an example here here you have someone telling Don Jr. and telling
[53:39.800 --> 53:43.640]  the world at the same time that it's a crime to disclose who a whistleblower is
[53:43.640 --> 53:47.000]  saying her law degree told her so well maybe she got her law degree out of a
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.480]  cereal box because that's not what any law requires it's only when they
[53:50.480 --> 53:55.480]  approach at the level of the inspector general that the inspector general is
[53:55.480 --> 53:59.680]  not to tell the public but it's never made there there's first amendment
[53:59.680 --> 54:03.440]  reasons why it can't be private because the example like a lot of court cases
[54:03.440 --> 54:07.520]  they seal the court file that is the courts not putting it out but the
[54:07.520 --> 54:10.760]  parties can't exactly I mean the reason why we have primitive information act
[54:10.760 --> 54:15.360]  laws sunshine laws privacy act laws all these laws are meant to protect people's
[54:15.360 --> 54:18.760]  rights to know and have transparency in government you don't get to try to stage
[54:18.760 --> 54:21.760]  a coup against the president of the United States and then say I get to stay a
[54:21.760 --> 54:25.200]  secret witness and let's have a star chamber proceeding well I mean I mean
[54:25.200 --> 54:28.600]  it's like what they did only Balazi forward come forward she was a CIA
[54:28.600 --> 54:33.400]  recruiter her dad was a high-level CIA at Baker Hostetler one of the most
[54:33.400 --> 54:37.080]  powerful law firms out there that we know well James Baker and all the rest of
[54:37.080 --> 54:40.480]  it and then almost all the other women have said I was threatened with my
[54:40.480 --> 54:44.000]  criminal record that they'd say I was this or that if I didn't go along with
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.560]  it than other women said I was never called I just saw my name on the news
[54:47.560 --> 54:51.200]  then they called and threatened me with my background which I'm not gonna tell
[54:51.200 --> 54:55.440]  you you know if I did this and some had been hookers some had been busted for
[54:55.440 --> 54:58.880]  drugs and so they go oh we've run your background they look at a whole
[54:58.880 --> 55:03.120]  university they call up women that never knew cabin on say he raped you didn't
[55:03.120 --> 55:06.160]  know well I'm gonna tell people you're a hooker how do you know that well we got
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.840]  an FBI scan on you okay I mean that but then the women later go I don't care he
[55:10.840 --> 55:14.640]  didn't do it even though they're threatening to put the women in jail or
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.520]  bring out that their prostitutes the all they did was a scan of prostitutes at
[55:18.520 --> 55:22.280]  the college you know people that were 30 years later were prostitutes decades
[55:22.280 --> 55:26.540]  before that is so damn evil but that's what the deep state does folks and they've
[55:26.540 --> 55:29.960]  gone around to everybody that knows me and they called him up and they've
[55:29.960 --> 55:33.400]  threatened him and they've got backgrounds and databases but luckily my
[55:33.400 --> 55:37.720]  circle of friends and family don't have any dirt but they go oh we'll make it up
[55:37.720 --> 55:40.400]  I've had the New York Times we're getting lawsuits and things ready folks
[55:40.400 --> 55:45.920]  literally call up pull it surprise winners okay mafia gangsters and literally
[55:45.920 --> 55:49.840]  start threatening people with data money they've done on them we're gonna do a
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.520]  story on you unless you tell us Alex Jones did this and I've got witnesses
[55:54.520 --> 55:57.320]  ladies and gentlemen witnesses from Hillary Clinton law firms that
[55:57.320 --> 56:01.160]  literally people recorded the phone calls oh yeah we've got this stuff where
[56:01.160 --> 56:05.160]  they're literally going well that isn't enough tell us Jones is a homosexual tell
[56:05.160 --> 56:09.040]  us Jones wanted to have sex with you we'll give you $10,000 more these
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.280]  people are lawless ladies and gentlemen because they go what will hurt him with
[56:13.280 --> 56:18.160]  his audience we'll say he's gay they're just this is all crap ladies and
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.840]  gentlemen with a degree to which they once you weaponize the legal system and
[56:21.840 --> 56:25.280]  once you start engaging in stasi style techniques and once you start doing
[56:25.280 --> 56:29.360]  Soviet style trials and once you start doing star chambers style you're over
[56:29.360 --> 56:33.160]  the edge of the cliff now that the the reason why we don't allow that in
[56:33.160 --> 56:37.600]  America is because also a bad mechanism of producing truth so it's not just a
[56:37.600 --> 56:40.600]  matter of it being problematic from a First Amendment perspective from a
[56:40.600 --> 56:43.960]  freedom perspective you fall into a banana republic real fast exactly and
[56:43.960 --> 56:47.760]  you often don't get the truth the you know like the famous movie that Henry
[56:47.760 --> 56:50.960]  Fonda was in about 12 angry men and the one juror that holds out because he
[56:50.960 --> 56:54.960]  recognizes the truth you in order to get you need confrontation you need
[56:54.960 --> 56:59.000]  cross-examination you need due process in order to get the truth you need
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.760]  investigation exactly you cannot get the truth if you're only hearing one side
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.280]  that can coerce its witnesses in in creative ways that can engage in secrecy
[57:07.280 --> 57:11.160]  that can prevent transparency that can prevent public review and public
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.280]  scrutiny that you have net effect of that is you're gonna create a lie either
[57:14.280 --> 57:17.920]  what the the outcome of that proceeding will not how long and then it
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.000]  discredits the whole system absolutely how long do you think the New York Times
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.440]  have been so bad they offer money for lies well I mean I think that you go to
[57:26.440 --> 57:29.560]  the sort of deep state modus operandi what caused that Snowden to become Ed
[57:29.560 --> 57:34.800]  Snowden was him witnessing how the high-ranking and well connected officials
[57:34.800 --> 57:38.120]  within the State Department and other aspects of defense contractor world would
[57:38.120 --> 57:41.360]  routinely try to extort people and they were watching him have sex with his wife
[57:41.360 --> 57:45.160]  over his laptop I mean people are sick of this yeah we'll be right back so stay
[57:45.160 --> 57:53.480]  with us the time has come to defy the thought police they are banning hundreds
[57:53.480 --> 57:57.520]  and hundreds of symbols every year they're waging war on communication
[57:57.520 --> 58:02.680]  itself as the Fabian socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago
[58:02.680 --> 58:08.120]  from their command base in England we've had Oxford come out in band clapping
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.680]  the ADL and others will literally bankrupt you kick you out of college
[58:12.680 --> 58:17.440]  destroy you have you arrested in some areas if you do the okay symbol that's
[58:17.440 --> 58:21.760]  the international sign language symbol for okay they know what they're doing
[58:21.760 --> 58:26.480]  these people are authoritarians and they're dangerous and the answer to their
[58:26.480 --> 58:31.200]  attack on speech is to exercise it in their face we have a it's okay to be
[58:31.200 --> 58:35.440]  okay politically incorrect ball cap it's black and white very nice as the okay

[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:17.760]  all right Barnes is gonna go get back as a busy little elf in his workshop and
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:21.400]  things we're doing I'm with each state he'll be back with Owen shroyer to get
[1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:24.680]  into the whole kangaroo trial up in DC the latest developments Owen will be in
[1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:29.640]  studio and then you are quite the expert on election fraud and voter fraud we
[1:00:29.640 --> 1:00:32.360]  were looking over the Kentucky reports that we're gonna be premiering in the
[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:37.360]  fourth hour good thing that the governor did not concede because we've caught
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:41.200]  them red-handed I mean this is red-freaking handed well it's there's
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:44.960]  all a wide range of ways to monitor and document this stuff whenever they've
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:48.320]  done any substantial or sophisticated survey they find millions of people
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:51.880]  registered in multiple states they find millions of dead people registered
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.360]  still in the voter rolls it reminds me the old Chicago joke where they're
[1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:58.640]  going around registering voters and at one point the young kid says do we have
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:02.600]  to keep going and the head guy looks around the cemetery and says would you
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:07.080]  dare deny these people the right to vote that's the nature I remember the Dallas
[1:01:07.080 --> 1:01:11.120]  Cowboys the whole roster was voting in Dallas in Vegas and they somehow in
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:14.040]  Vegas someone had registered the every single member of the Dallas Cowboys
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:17.480]  roster who obviously were not living in Las Vegas and bugs bunny bugs bunny was
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:20.760]  there in fact if you search most voter rolls you'll find a bugs bunny you'll
[1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:24.200]  find the rest where this gets exposed as I do a lot of representation of people
[1:01:24.200 --> 1:01:27.560]  who try to petition for a candidate independent third-party person to get on
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:31.560]  the ballot or a issue to get on the ballot and in that context you have to
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:35.400]  grind and get signatures you'll see the established parties that don't want that
[1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.240]  issue to be on the ballot or that candidate to be on the ballot all of a
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:41.160]  sudden they become very rigorous about all the problems with the voter
[1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:44.240]  registration oh yes they say oh by the way this name doesn't even match this
[1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:48.080]  address this signature doesn't matter oh yeah it's like but Donna Brazil who
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:51.560]  rigged the debates on record admits it and it's in the WikiLeaks rigging things
[1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:55.240]  oh she says don't worry about Kentucky yeah you just go back to sleep now
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:59.600]  exactly well the it's and in what they usually find in the in the petition
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:03.720]  context is half of the signatures are invalid so if half of the voter
[1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:07.600]  registration files are invalid for the purposes of a petition what percentage
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:11.080]  are invalid for the purposes of voter registration of people who never even
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:14.480]  bothered to sign a petition so the that's where there's concerns about the
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:18.040]  way we I mean people are shocked I was over in London and they were discussing
[1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:21.240]  voter rolls and whatnot and one of the Canadians who sort of tore the to the
[1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:25.440]  left was talking about voter ID and how that's discriminatory and this guy from
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:29.520]  India said well of course you have to have voter ID to vote right because what
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:33.640]  country would not allow you to not require voter ID to vote otherwise we'll
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:38.080]  have all kinds of voter fraud vote multiple times etc the and yet that is
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:42.000]  the United States for the most part so again conservatives myself included I
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.920]  know how to get the names of dead people and I know how to go in and vote
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:49.560]  illegally watch the Democrat I can't bring myself to do it but there's
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:54.280]  coming a point where okay sheet like they do or shooting war and I'm and I'm
[1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:58.520]  just being honest I've never been a cheat and I'm not gonna adopt cheating
[1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:02.760]  standards but we've got to beat them by sending them to jail I mean it's got to
[1:03:02.760 --> 1:03:05.760]  happen well what's fascinating is the absentee voter campaign issue that
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:09.760]  unseated a Republican congressman in North Carolina the main person who
[1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:13.040]  created those absentee ballots that turned out to be fake or fraudulent
[1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:16.760]  was someone who often worked for Democrats so the in California for they
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:21.840]  saw an unprecedented in 2018 number of ballots come in after the election was
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:24.280]  over we're gonna talk about that the fourth hour and they're putting that all
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:28.880]  off but judicial watch what just three months ago sued just in LA and got
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:32.280]  proved two million people were on the roll shouldn't be and most of them were
[1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:37.160]  voting dead people a lot of me that's two million just in a canvas of the of LA
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:41.200]  that's what like 10 million people well the biggest issue is if if people who
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:45.560]  are here illegally are allowed to get driver's licenses and these states are
[1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:48.400]  automatically putting them on the voter rolls as soon as they get driver's
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:51.720]  licenses then aren't there gonna be a lot of people who are well that's what
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:55.440]  I was telling Millie that's the issue because this this whistleblower of a
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:59.120]  slave that happened to them in South Dakota her husband is a legal immigrant
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:02.600]  he's never voted and then she just called to check if she'd already gotten off
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:05.600]  things and she's on there and he's on there and they both voted and they're
[1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:09.320]  scared like well wait he's not even a citizen we're gonna get arrested saying
[1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:12.520]  he voted no you're in South Dakota it's not your fault so now we've given the
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.440]  criminal investigators we've got recordings of that I mean it's just
[1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:19.200]  insane I mean it's it's it's just what you just said that's how they're doing it
[1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:23.600]  and of course this doesn't even get to the issue of having non paper ballots and
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:27.320]  having no paper ballot trail and that you have a lot of states that's purely
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:30.480]  digital and so the ability to they admitted this when they were trying to
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:33.120]  blame Russians for it it's like well hold on a second that means you've known
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:37.120]  all along that you can manipulate these computers to manufacture an outcome does
[1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:40.560]  this explain why sometimes election outcomes vary dramatically from polls
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:45.160]  yes it's incredible and the Democrats are the masters of voter level fraud
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:49.040]  organizing voters into large blocks to vote in the names of dead people or
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:51.280]  folks that have moved out of the area and we've got a huge report in the
[1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:59.400]  fourth hour it's game-changing stay with us thank you mom the witch queen of the
[1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:05.360]  deep state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant and the corporate
[1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:09.600]  whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile in blackmail
[1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:15.280]  raids thought that her victory was assured now that the enemy lost that
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:19.800]  election they are awake and throwing everything they've got at us and
[1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:23.280]  conservatives and nationalistic Christians and patriots many of them are
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:27.440]  asleep thinking 2020s in the bag ladies and gentlemen we just lost Kentucky
[1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:31.200]  government ship we just lost the Virginia State House the first time in 30
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:36.960]  years this is serious we can win again and secure the gains we've gotten or we
[1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:40.920]  can see it all washed down the drain whatever you do get more politically
[1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:44.920]  activated than you ever have and spread the live links at fan dot video and in
[1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:52.360]  four wars dot com for its last show if you want to defeat the deep state the globalist then get fired up
[1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:58.080]  fan dot video
[1:05:59.760 --> 1:06:06.600]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[1:06:06.600 --> 1:06:25.320]  of the info war all right ladies and gentlemen my head is spinning right now
[1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:30.600]  I've already covered a lot of news but I haven't even scratched the surface of
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:37.440]  what we're going to be breaking down here today but I'm gonna do my best to
[1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:43.640]  cover a lot of the news right now and then we're gonna have Owen shroyer who
[1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:47.760]  was up at the Roger Stone trial in studio just talk about the leftist their
[1:06:47.760 --> 1:06:51.400]  attacks on him what he witnessed what it's like to watch the judge let anti
[1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:57.200]  Trump protesters on the courthouse grounds he she gives them electricity for
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:03.600]  their blow up rats and blow up Trump baby dolls you know the baby blimp but
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:06.680]  then if they do anything or even pull a sign out she arrests them I mean it's
[1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:11.800]  just she ought to be building a physical railroad out of the courtroom to the
[1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:16.400]  federal prison that's where railroading obviously comes from and now they want
[1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:20.800]  me arrested and the judge has shot her mouth off about me a whole bunch and they
[1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:24.720]  played clips of me in there and they're doing it to scare the jury I'm not
[1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:28.760]  threatening the jury but they go Alex Jones is threatening you knowing that
[1:07:28.760 --> 1:07:32.160]  that will make them then think of Roger Stone is even more evil then they play
[1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:37.800]  clips of Roger Stone on the show so see I'm not threatening anybody I'm not
[1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:41.120]  going to the Sandy Hook parents houses I'm not doing any of the things they say
[1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:48.320]  I'm doing but they use my name to do it oh I'm the big juror tamper oh I'm the
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:53.200]  big criminal I need to be indicted and again it's not about Alex Jones it's
[1:07:53.200 --> 1:08:00.280]  about how they do it they use you as a puppet
[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:04.840]  that and Alex Jones puppet here and then somebody took it and put words in
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:10.000]  its mouth that wouldn't be Alex Jones but they they'll say Alex Jones had a
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  grim reaper on and threaten the jurors of course they don't show you a video
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:20.040]  because it didn't happen we had a grim reaper on the show about Epstein but
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:27.600]  they don't care because they're nasty dirty criminals and I just got to ask
[1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:32.360]  what are they gonna do next you imagine being Trump they got a big group of
[1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:36.240]  women lined up to say he raped him that's coming next watch they just
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:41.680]  recycle the same crap that's the next thing coming and then it's gonna be oh
[1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:47.040]  a black lady that worked heard him say the n-word just as sure as Christmas is
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:53.480]  coming up in a month and a half you can set your watch by what they're gonna do
[1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:57.800]  and I'm not just gonna sit here and take it but see they don't want me on air
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:04.320]  because this whistleblower was public he went and testified it came out that he
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:10.120]  wasn't a whistleblower the Ceremella guy and that his lawyer is a again got a
[1:09:10.120 --> 1:09:18.920]  pleasure to remove Trump and is a big globalist bootlicker and they're
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:23.320]  threatening to arrest Don Jr. and just off saying that's illegal the public's so
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:28.840]  ignorant Fox News don't say his name it's banned the press doesn't even know
[1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:36.520]  it's rights same thing with Twitter's banning saying the guy's name see first
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:41.160]  it's don't say Alex Jones five months ago or you'll be banned on Facebook now
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:45.720]  it's oh don't show yourself at an NRA shooting event we call that terrorist
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:48.400]  they're now banning people's channels for that oh and by the way don't promote
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:51.880]  pro-life and oh by the way don't criticize vaccines oh you took a vaccine
[1:09:51.880 --> 1:09:55.240]  almost killed you and the doctor told you was a vaccine don't complainer your
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:59.520]  band there's a big list of things and we're teaching you if you want to be
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:04.080]  able to communicate over these new systems that we're watching with AI wow
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:10.880]  and Congress does nothing and we do nothing now I said I would start the
[1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:20.880]  broadcast today with really what is the biggest story and the story's so big and
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:31.120]  I've done so much research on it that I get in a position where I feel like I'm
[1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:34.800]  not doing it justice like I just sit here at the regular broadcast desk it
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:38.000]  kind of gets lost in the background like oh that's just you know part of the
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:43.440]  important stuff he's covering no I'm going to do and I've got to do it and
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:45.960]  I've been getting more and more done than I say I'm gonna do it because you can
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:50.520]  feel the quickening and I may not be on air much longer I mean this country may
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:54.720]  not be here much longer you may not be here much longer this is serious you can
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:11:01.920]  feel it you can see it but I want to do a PowerPoint type presentation where I'm
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:06.440]  at a lectern probably in here with these big TV screens and where I walk
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:10.480]  through scientifically all of this but
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:20.280]  100% there is a process of incrementally engineering our diseased short lives
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:25.560]  and then the western life expectancy is plunging the birth rates plunging
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:29.960]  infant mortality is skyrocketing and then you've got white papers where they
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:34.560]  say that they are soft killing us and they see it as giving humanity
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:42.080]  radiation therapy but not to save us to kill us and so 5g and all of this the
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:47.120]  2g the 3g the 4g's been a test and now they're gonna put in millions of 5g
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:53.800]  that I've got major mainline scientific reports you know American Medical
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:59.000]  Journal you name it admitting that 5g worse than any other thing you've seen
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:05.120]  rattles your molecules like a microwave it is microwave and creates toxins in
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:10.920]  the body and kills you and makes you go insane while it does it and I was
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:16.880]  sitting there last night at about 11 o'clock reading a 70-something page and
[1:12:16.880 --> 1:12:19.560]  I read the whole thing
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:25.480]  three two different studies this one's 40 that was over 30 70 plus pages with
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:31.080]  with mainline studies of how it's killing you and your family and I just
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:36.520]  decided I've got to do something oh Los Angeles Times slight risk in tumors I
[1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:42.040]  don't know big deal well this is way above that and it's done by design you
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:45.160]  hear him say there's too many humans were bad get rid of our population save
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:51.720]  the earth this is all part of a diabolical plan and we've even discovered
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:56.760]  going off the maps of where 5g's going in that curiously even in maps from 10
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:12:59.960]  years from now they've got large zones it's not going to be in and you watch
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:03.400]  that's gonna be with the property values go up that's where the elite are
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:07.920]  moving we've already documented and I'm busier than a one-legged man in an
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:18.280]  ass-kicking contest okay and but I mean I want to go to West Virginia and show
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:23.240]  you a 9,000 square mile range by law where you can't have any frequencies and
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:26.920]  look at who lives there and the helicopter pads and the elites all there
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:31.280]  I mean they they've got something planned here and they can oscillate these
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:35.000]  things to really kill you quickly or fry you or make you go insane and I've got
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.760]  all the studies all the patents all the CIA stuff I mean I've got it all I've
[1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:44.880]  got total proofs just like I told you I've got total proof of the geo
[1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:48.920]  engineering and now they admit the whole thing while separately having Edward
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:53.160]  Snowden come out and say it doesn't exist when all he got was limited stuff
[1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:59.400]  and like he's like he knows everything so they do not want you discussing this
[1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:03.200]  they do not want you knowing about this and I don't trust snowed as far as you
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:14.600]  could throw him so we're gonna be laying all of that out as well but this is the
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:18.440]  takedown of humanity going on and I know I harp on that but I want to explain
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:24.400]  something I'm not exaggerating one bit in fact it's so horrible so multifaceted
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:32.000]  so huge that I can't even wrap my brain around it but it's run by a scientific
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.880]  group who are in on the plan and they've admitted a lot of it in public
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:40.880]  because they're about to externalize the hierarchy they're going full
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:48.560]  operational let me put it to you this way when a king arrives or something they
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:52.800]  blow trumpets and have fanfare well should I play Imperial Battle March
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:57.760]  should I cut a finger off to make people know it's important I mean I would have
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:00.600]  got your attention I'm out of self armor I've got my arm off right now with a
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:03.440]  saw just you know hey I'm really serious this is killing you and your family but
[1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:08.520]  that would do they just locked me up I mean a drumroll how do I do this they're
[1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:14.840]  moving out of the beta test of the soft kill the ambient silent weapons for
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:21.360]  quiet wars into operational phase and so you think cancer up 10,000% or you
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:27.000]  think all that's bad let me tell you get ready to die okay they're flipping the
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:35.200]  switches right now and this is it so the racism garbage the sexism all that
[1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:39.760]  stuff is just a distraction of quote you know fake little fights to distract
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:44.400]  you from this thing is not of this world it's made a deal with the so-called
[1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:49.040]  elite and the fallen one is making its move on us before we go to launch phase

[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:12.640]  voter rolls the woman is a republican hadn't lived in the state for years she
[1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:18.520]  got off the rolls she's conscientious she was put back on as a democrat and now
[1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:23.520]  they're looking at it investigating it and as of this morning when I was
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:26.560]  talking to him and listening to the tapes they were saying that they had voted
[1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:32.000]  even though they're in another state and did not vote so you want to see the
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:36.080]  proof 175,000 people that weren't on the rolls were put on and now we're
[1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:40.640]  confirming many of them never voted not even citizens and remember the current
[1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:47.280]  governor only lost by 4,000 votes and change they're doing a recount right
[1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:52.160]  now ladies and gentlemen let's just recount the same votes we need to go in
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:57.320]  and drill into who voted and that's where you'll find the fraud so get this
[1:22:57.320 --> 1:23:02.400]  report out it just went live on info wars calm breaking new evidence confirms
[1:23:02.400 --> 1:23:09.040]  Kentucky election fraud by the Democrats of course that was the individual at the
[1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:14.800]  state level that got the change made and got that done Kentucky Secretary of
[1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:20.920]  State Allison Lundgren whose daddy just gotten a lot of trouble but I'm sure now
[1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:24.400]  there's gonna be a governor they control everything will be okay this is a big
[1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:31.520]  deal here's the report recently we were in litigation we had through the course
[1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:39.720]  of this last what's called list maintenance where it deemed 175,000
[1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:45.960]  voters is inactive and then through litigation from different individual
[1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:54.640]  agencies and partners individuals that suit required us to add those 175,000
[1:23:54.640 --> 1:24:01.880]  back in again this video is on enforcing Kentucky State Board of Elections
[1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:11.120]  I was like speaking to my husband as well and I was trying to explain something
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:14.360]  to him and I think you're gonna be sending the email because like I told you
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:20.640]  you know we work with the AG and he took care of it in 2016 and what he doesn't
[1:24:20.640 --> 1:24:26.920]  understand is I said that we were accidentally like how were we off in 2018
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:32.480]  now I can't tell you I cannot tell you that that's how but the only reason that
[1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:39.680]  stands is recently we were in litigation we had through the course of this last
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:49.400]  what's called list maintenance where it deemed 175,000 voters is inactive and
[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:55.600]  then through litigation from different individual agencies and partners
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:25:04.080]  individuals that suit required us to add those 175,000 back in now you said the
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:08.640]  only way you knew that in 2018 as you checked and you weren't on the only way
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:12.880]  I can envision that that happened is through that process I can't tell you
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:16.640]  that for sure because that what I can see is not all of the activity record
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:22.080]  right low man here and I'm not one of the chiefs and one of the chiefs could
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:26.640]  probably tell you if it was the thing is and I work with Governor Bevin's
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:30.960]  office right when I when this came to my attention and like I said my concern
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:35.320]  in 2016 was because everyone was talking about all this election fraud I was
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:39.440]  like what if someone votes you know on behalf of my husband then he's gonna get
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:44.160]  automatically deported that's automatic deportation that was my first red flag
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:48.760]  when you called was how first and foremost how was he able to register when
[1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:54.600]  that first question is so there are cards and the cards have a permanent
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:58.960]  retention so if you like me to I'll be glad to call though they are extremely
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:03.280]  busy and this will not be an end one that will could take front burner I assure
[1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:07.760]  you the fact that it has me as a Democrat is insane as I stated and if I
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:12.600]  stated to you prior all I can do is try to help you in this endeavor I was here
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:18.120]  in 16 I worked in the same position and I and I would have kind of remembered
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:21.880]  this maybe I don't know that was a presidential election year with a lot
[1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:28.760]  going on right only activity I cheat I say is 2008 the original registration
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:36.840]  and then I see after that a change in 2010 and it looks like the change of back
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:43.600]  hand a for your husband however was in 2011 right see that's my thing
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:50.360]  November 2011 so each time they each time it updated his voter registration as
[1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:58.840]  well so that I can start investigation of this for you miss yeah again I
[1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:04.360]  would emphasize to you that the process for retention on any type of
[1:27:04.360 --> 1:27:11.040]  correspondence from 18 has passed right it wouldn't well we're right at that 22
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:16.200]  month period so I only thing I can do is right now ensure you the method for
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:20.400]  removal I have spoken to my executive director and we're in reference to the
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:25.000]  situation right and that's the best avenue I can find for you right now to
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:29.960]  ensure that you are not on these voter rolls right on that and you're and
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:34.160]  you're speaking to the AG's office and 18 that that's something is beyond my
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:37.720]  controls but it's not really funny when I see that we were removed and added back
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:42.480]  on is a little bit crazy right right and you're not the it's not the only time
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:47.440]  that I've seen that happen individuals who are in whole green card and are able
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:52.000]  to get driver's licenses unfortunately our erroneous really registered here and
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.120]  then when they go through the process of naturalization they find that out and
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:01.440]  they have to go through a lengthy process to ensure that that is denoted so
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.080]  they can re-register and unfortunately that error is on the part of the stop
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:10.880]  right there we have multiple calls to the governor's office that was the
[1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:17.120]  Secretary of State's office we have it all and we have the copies of this woman
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:21.440]  and her husband who's not a citizen on it and they're totally freaked out he's
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:24.920]  never voted he's not trying to vote he's trying to become a citizen she's a
[1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:31.520]  Republican left a long time ago and checked and found it out now that's
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:36.640]  what they did and the Democrats did this and they're putting this governor in
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:39.840]  and you know that's only tip of the iceberg and they need to be
[1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:44.160]  investigated and they need to not just recount the votes the same fake votes
[1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:47.640]  they need to burrow into those names and see how many are fake and you know
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:52.160]  they're gonna find the 4,000 something they need that's it they're done they
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:58.960]  lost they're getting caught we can all agree these are troubled times right so

[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:11.840]  going down going down now I want to be clear we've got so much huge developments
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:18.920]  happening around the world but why do I keep them harping on Roger Stone's show
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:21.840]  trial it's not just that I'm friends with Roger it's not just they're trying to put
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:28.040]  me in jail either it's that this is a move against the entire country and all
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:32.040]  our rights they're doing this everywhere the left in Europe and the United States
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:37.080]  has weaponized the judiciary and the legal system and Owen Troyer just got
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:42.640]  back from DC last night did a great job reporting there saw incredible
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:46.720]  circuses he's gonna break down and I just wanted to get his take on the sense
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:50.760]  of things and where he thinks this is going Robert Barnes is with us I just
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:55.960]  played recording from the Secretary of State's criminal investigation division
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:01.840]  talking to folks that we have documented our our friends of our
[1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:08.280]  investigative journalist who live in South Dakota and her son her husband is
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:13.440]  not a citizen yet he's never voted but they had him on the voter rolls and as
[1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:18.280]  voting so that's what's going on here and it's confirmed that the Democrats
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:23.720]  put 175,000 in just one move back on the rolls they've only won by a little more
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:27.720]  than 4,000 votes so that's being contested but you ask why are they so
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:31.720]  openly criminal because they get away with it they never get in trouble with
[1:38:31.720 --> 1:38:36.840]  fake whistleblowers and fake dossiers and Russia gate and fake lawsuits against
[1:38:36.840 --> 1:38:40.440]  me and the attacks on Trump and saying it's illegal for us to expose or put
[1:38:40.440 --> 1:38:44.280]  no Obama officials on the jury or it's illegal for Don Jr. to expose the fake
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:48.680]  whistleblower because he's a big Trump hating Democrat it's not illegal so oh
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:51.200]  and it's good to have you here aren't just good to have you pop it back in
[1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:53.680]  whether this will be covering election fraud in the fourth hour you and I was
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:57.120]  Millie Weaver with more on this huge story but that's at info wars.com
[1:38:57.120 --> 1:39:02.360]  exclusively and you notice time and time again we break it first that it's
[1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:09.560]  national news the next day but they usually say oh arrest Jones and then
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:13.240]  they'll change the subject he released voter roll info that's illegal or
[1:39:13.240 --> 1:39:17.840]  something like that to get to deflect away from what they're doing so when
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:21.920]  you were there you talked to Roger your former co-host you're in the middle of
[1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.200]  this what was it like well Alex I think the problem that we're all struggling
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:29.060]  with right now is to decide what is the biggest story you're gonna break down the
[1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:32.320]  5g threat to humanity you're gonna break down the illegal voting we just had
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:37.280]  go down in Kentucky we're breaking down the I mean it's not it's beyond a
[1:39:37.280 --> 1:39:41.740]  dereliction of justice this is a a sabotage of justice this is a a
[1:39:41.740 --> 1:39:46.360]  bastardization of justice what's going on with Roger Stone where now this judge
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:50.640]  who's not a judge she's a liberal activist on a bench she's a she's a
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:55.320]  revolutionary progressive liberal in a black robe that's what she is she's now
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:58.680]  intimidated people out of their free speech not just Roger who won't even
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.000]  say a word on a camera right now but all the Rogers associates now and they say
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:06.680]  oh you're in contempt of court because you dare to express your opinion on a
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:10.440]  roger stuff woman thinks she's got more power than an ancient emperor and
[1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:14.400]  sadly she does look at what she's getting away with well the fear does
[1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:18.200]  they're all over the news arrest Jones Washington Post federal prosecutors
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:23.640]  under Obama arrest him arrest him arrest him but it's the arrogance it's the
[1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:27.000]  arrogance of it it's the entitlement insolence have it to get away with it I
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:33.320]  mean I've never seen a judge and people get up and just have just total
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:37.360]  ubris like weird we know it's a damn you know it's Tim's former federal
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:40.480]  law enforcement and he says he's never been a trial like this he felt dirty
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:44.520]  leaving it and he said it's all totally rigged and yeah he said as well what
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:49.000]  Tucker Carlson said she's snorting cackling laughing like she's running
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:52.640]  yeah flying monkeys up there whether if she could she probably would maybe you
[1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:55.600]  know pick a couple guys eyes out because they didn't like what they say they
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:00.280]  are my pretties get them fly fly bring them to me but you can see it and I don't
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:04.480]  know you know obviously Bobby you you may hear things but I don't know what
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:08.800]  this lady's reputation is as a judge I know judges have reputations but we can
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:12.440]  talk about it all day but this is this is who Obama put in the swamp as that
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:16.720]  judge where they send cases to destroy people so a reputation is a guillotine
[1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:20.480]  operator right well my view was that the government manipulated the way they
[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:23.960]  brought the case in order to get it directly in front of her clearly they
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:27.680]  believed that she would rule in their favor that she would rule on their side
[1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:31.460]  of the aisle and my view was that she there should have been a motion to
[1:41:31.460 --> 1:41:34.960]  recuse filed because of the way in which they had the government had
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:41.560]  manipulated but it wasn't done and so this is a last gasp of the giant Russia
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:46.920]  gate host it's like the dinner dessert well the only federal the only person
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:51.400]  I've ever known to actually tamper with the jury to interfere or impair a jury
[1:41:51.400 --> 1:41:55.040]  during their deliberations process in any case I've ever been a part of was a
[1:41:55.040 --> 1:41:59.840]  federal judge a federal judge get engaged in ex parte communications the U.S.
[1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:04.240]  Marshall hit it the court clerks hit it the law clerks hit it everybody hit it
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:07.800]  everybody conspired with the judge to do what he did they only did the judge only
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:12.000]  volunteer only knew about it because the judge confessed it because apparently
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:16.080]  he was afraid that the jury was gonna tell me about it after the trial so
[1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:18.800]  sadly that's the way our system operates and there was no adverse
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  consequence that ever happened to that judge so there are they getting more
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:24.200]  bold because they're confident or because they're desperate because they're
[1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:27.040]  just like foaming at the mouth criminals it's both I think what's
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:30.040]  happening is you have a federal judiciary that believes in its it's very
[1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:34.040]  self-righteous and believes the ends justify the meat that's it left or a
[1:42:34.040 --> 1:42:37.960]  bunch of sanctimonious people and what what's frightening is that there's not
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:41.240]  enough limitation not enough introspection not enough looking back and
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:44.240]  saying hold on how does this appear to the world so let's predict what's gonna
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:47.960]  happen to Roger when we come back and we all know the jury's gonna convict him
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:58.200]  it's the whole things are hugs will be right back the time has come to defy the
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:03.480]  thought police they are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:08.680]  they're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian socialists promise
[1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:13.960]  they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England we've
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:19.480]  had Oxford come out in band clapping the ADL and others will literally bankrupt
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:23.480]  you kick you out of college destroy you have you arrested in some areas if you
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:27.440]  do the okay symbol that's the international sign language symbol for
[1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:32.400]  okay they know what they're doing these people are authoritarian and they're
[1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:37.000]  dangerous and the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.720]  face we have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap it's
[1:43:41.720 --> 1:43:45.400]  black and white very nice as the okay symbol on it it's a great way to start

[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:04.920]  different types of iodine well that's because different types of physiology
[1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.560]  different types of metabolic systems and people will like different formulas
[1:45:09.560 --> 1:45:15.120]  it's just that simple x3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:20.240]  types because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:25.440]  atomic iodine get both they're both great for you whichever one you like use
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:30.720]  that and give the other to family or friends bottom line iodine is essential
[1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:35.040]  that's why I harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a
[1:45:35.040 --> 1:45:39.600]  lot of reasons lower IQ makes you sluggish you don't live as long it's
[1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:44.320]  simple get your high-quality I don't info or store calm and help fund the info
[1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:49.280]  war info or store calm we've got a huge sale running right now but it's about the
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:54.600]  end it's the iodine challenge both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off
[1:45:54.600 --> 1:46:03.560]  together the witch queen of the deep state lost the 2016 election because she
[1:46:03.560 --> 1:46:07.880]  was arrogant and the corporate whores in the media busily covering up her
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:13.440]  giant pedophile in blackmail rings thought that her victory was assured now
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:18.600]  that the enemy lost that election they are awake and throwing everything they've
[1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:22.560]  got at us and conservatives and nationalists to christians and patriots
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:26.560]  many of them are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag ladies and gentlemen we just
[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:30.560]  lost Kentucky governor ship we just lost the Virginia State House the first
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:36.040]  time in 30 years this is serious we can win again and secure the gains we've
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:40.440]  gotten or we can see it all washed down the drain whatever you do get more
[1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:44.320]  politically activated than you ever have and spread the live links at bandot

[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:17.240]  from the front lines of the information war from the front lines of the
[1:47:17.240 --> 1:47:25.480]  information war it's Alex Jones patriots transform and roll out all right
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:29.040]  you were on fire during the break oh and about just everything how they let
[1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:32.600]  demonstrators that are anti-stone be there but not pro-stone totally illegal
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:38.760]  just total rigging setting the precedent flaunting it cackling laughing you
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:41.720]  were talking about it's like a girls party in there with these FBI agents
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:45.360]  everything it's just so much fun Roger being beaten up nobody's even allowed to
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:50.000]  tell the public everyone groveling and fear I mean get into it talk about what's
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.720]  happening Roger where this is going well I don't think I've ever seen or heard
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:58.280]  of anything quite like this I'm sure Bob maybe there's some other instance where
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:02.040]  someone has been so set up and and a court rigged like this where they rigged
[1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:05.320]  the judge they rigged the jury they rigged the witness I mean literally
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:09.440]  checkmate over the whole court case and yeah the judge is in there laughing
[1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:12.680]  cackling with her first you know witness that she gets the former FBI
[1:48:12.680 --> 1:48:16.480]  agent that's now a political operative this is all foreshadows of the
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:19.960]  impeachment oh yeah exactly I mean it puts me they can get away with it in an
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:23.400]  actual criminal trial if they can get away with star chamber try tight
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:29.280]  techniques I mean what about the comment I made yesterday was that you have not a
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:35.120]  mystery's threatened to press and you had and a gag defendant that's usually
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:38.480]  what people how people would describe a Russian trial not a just trial in the
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:41.160]  United States of America but they don't just gag the defendant they gag
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:45.880]  anybody associated with the defendant yes it's extraordinary it's it's all
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:50.440]  intimidation this judge is like shut up nobody talk about anything
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:55.640]  I'm in command bringing more Obama and Hillary people on appoint them and shut
[1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.480]  down that journalist down I mean Jacob Engels is a writer for the South
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:02.480]  Florida Post he's following the Roger Stone story he lives in Florida he's not
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:04.880]  allowed to talk he's being held in contempt of court now for his first
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:08.160]  amendment they want to go after Alex Jones because he dares say it on air and
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:10.600]  that's really what it is it's the fact that you're willing to say it on air well
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:15.480]  that's the new thing arrest on junior arrest Alex Jones and none of them see
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:19.320]  legal just like Cuomo you're a WikiLeaks you're going to jail I can read them you
[1:49:19.320 --> 1:49:24.720]  can't slaves I'm God I'm a Cuomo well it's sort of the the freight of the
[1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:28.840]  Fredo mindset that the political establishment the legal left has which
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:33.320]  is very just it's it's it's most parallel to communist states and communist
[1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:37.160]  governments is really what it is in the sense and it's really happening so what
[1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:41.480]  were your other observations well yeah they let the put the political operative
[1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:45.200]  from the Clinton administration Bill Clinton Claude Taylor out there with his
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:48.920]  rat he has a blow-up rat being powered off a government building that's nice
[1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:52.320]  is he the same guy that ate your microphone yes yes and video that's
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:56.000]  somewhere we have literally grabs your mic than each so he tried to eat he also
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:59.680]  wiped his nose with it his butt with it he shoved it in his tailpipe to not I
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:03.160]  mean literally in his car yeah there is right there that's Claude Taylor with
[1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:06.200]  his little Trump rat there he brought it out again for the stone trial so this is
[1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:10.840]  who Roger good it jumps out on him like the Spanish Inquisition but this guy's
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:15.400]  allowed to be out there set up his you know 10 20 foot blow-up rat doll or
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:18.680]  whatever the thing that is and that's perfectly fine if you're Jacob Engels
[1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:22.280]  and you want to organize people to support Roger because but again the left
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:26.080]  they threaten to arrest him to his face and then what happens it's like yeah it's
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:30.760]  worse the federal judge lets them plug into the courthouse power for the rat so
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:34.480]  Rogers walking in and there's people Russian flags saying oh thank you Russian
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:38.640]  comrade you know to set him up huge plastic rat saying he's a traitor and
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:43.000]  the judge is smiling with their flying monkeys you know doing circles around the
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:48.040]  castle it's the way the case is looking it does not look like a fair and impartial
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:51.120]  trial and that and that's the problem there has been an inadequate amount of
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:56.320]  concern by the judicial system and by the prosecution for cases at least should
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:50:59.800]  look fair you know I mean even if you're not going to have a fair trial at least
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:02.920]  try to try to have the appearance of fairness and there's a comp and it's a
[1:51:02.920 --> 1:51:07.360]  frightening the degree to which there is a cognizant awareness that this is a
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:11.520]  trial that doesn't look fair that anybody who comments on it about any
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:15.800]  unfair aspect of this trial is being threatened in some manner with either
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:21.520]  criminal prosecution by lawyers on social media or by members of the press who
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:26.200]  are described as quote-unquote experts I mean what makes someone an expert in
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:30.280]  the issues related to jury issues the prosecutor that they quoted as the
[1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:33.560]  expert in Washington Post who was calling for the Department of Justice to
[1:51:33.560 --> 1:51:36.680]  come after Alex Jones and anybody who was raising questions about the jury
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:41.160]  selection process the that same person what makes her an expert she didn't even
[1:51:41.160 --> 1:51:44.800]  she was not even aware of the First Amendment constitutional protection of
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:48.360]  that issue until other lawyers brought it to her attention so I mean it's all
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:52.120]  they are they're just assaulting it's a head on assault and if they can get away
[1:51:52.120 --> 1:51:55.560]  with this the reason why Roger Stone's case is much bigger than Roger Stone if
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:59.200]  they can get away with it in this case impeachment's gonna be a complete
[1:51:59.200 --> 1:52:03.000]  farce because if they can do this in an actual criminal trial that has a bunch
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:06.320]  of constitutional rules and statutory rules that limit what they can do
[1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:10.400]  imagine what a shift is gonna do they're gonna see this as a green light to
[1:52:10.400 --> 1:52:13.720]  complete a to create a complete start change well that's what they're doing
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:16.840]  to everybody and they've said that in fact the lawyer for the fake whistleblower
[1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:20.280]  I was a big fan of Epstein we've now found his tweets he literally says he
[1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:26.800]  would be honored to know that's the icing he is the same guy that you know
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:30.640]  was saying we're gonna use lawyers to take down Trump oh yes in a in a coup
[1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:34.520]  by the way we've got exclusive footage inside the courtroom of the judge and
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:36.960]  others here in mama we're gonna be rolling as soon as you have that footage
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:40.040]  just go ahead and roll it please keep going so yeah it's this case is much
[1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:44.280]  bigger than just what's happening in that courtroom so the the there's been
[1:52:44.280 --> 1:52:47.720]  an inadequate amount of concern for what's taking place for how it's taking
[1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:51.640]  place for the way it's going about it looks like you know in sort of 19th
[1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:54.920]  century Australia all railroads in kangaroos you know the judge has a good
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:52:58.040]  figure though look at her right there yeah he does look good in that black
[1:52:58.040 --> 1:53:01.920]  gown the whole nature of what's taking place makes it look like it's a
[1:53:01.920 --> 1:53:05.480]  political trial that's being done by the Politburo rather than a federal
[1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:09.120]  district court you tell that Washington Post I'll have him arrested and boiled
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:16.640]  alive get them tell the Americans to shut up CNN MSNBC fly fly actually have
[1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:21.000]  audio you guys back it up can we have audio come on guys back though in a
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:24.640]  minute I got audio in there too this is the courtroom roll it with audio please
[1:53:24.640 --> 1:53:34.360]  sorry keep going all right yeah okay please keep going guys well I think that
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:38.880]  all of America should just be appalled and stunned at witnessing what's
[1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:41.640]  happened to router stone and that's why they don't want people talking about it
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:44.680]  because they know that's the case they know that if people had an objective
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:49.880]  view of this I don't know what they're doing in there it's okay just keep
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:53.120]  going guys well we just had some some we're trying to get the audio from
[1:53:53.120 --> 1:53:55.880]  inside the political actor keep going with the with the wicked which are the
[1:53:55.880 --> 1:54:01.880]  rest so I think America should be appalled by this because it's like you
[1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:05.400]  said if they can do this to Roger Stone in this criminal trial there they can do
[1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:09.600]  it to anybody they want if they can intimidate the media from not reporting
[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:13.880]  on this because they're gonna threat you with a rest or something then you know
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:17.160]  where they gonna stop and the importance of high-profile trials is it
[1:54:17.160 --> 1:54:21.200]  educates the American public on their rights and so what happens when they
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:24.860]  those rights are not protected and not respected and either people inside the
[1:54:24.860 --> 1:54:28.440]  courtroom or in this context people outside the courtroom are threatening
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.800]  people if they talk about their rights and exercise those rights then those
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:37.000]  rights are gonna fade and it was the way in which you know institutions like
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:41.480]  slavery institutions like violating civil rights in the post 1865 South most
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:44.440]  of those things happened outside of the legal system the law the books on the
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:48.440]  laws did not allow what was taking place to take by the way when you had when you
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:53.560]  had people rigging courts racist people rigging courts against black people
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:59.040]  those were Democrats yes it was a Democrats did it imagine if you could
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:04.560]  not discuss jury selection and bias in the jury selection process these outside
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:08.060]  legal scholars and so-called experts according to the Washington Post would
[1:55:08.060 --> 1:55:10.960]  have made a crime for someone to identify that a Klansman was sitting on a
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:13.760]  civil rights jury or a jury involving an African-American defendant that's how
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:17.880]  ludicrous these applications are that's how dangerous these interpretations of
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:22.240]  the law are and that's how they're an imminent threat to democracy well I mean
[1:55:22.240 --> 1:55:26.040]  I got to tell you right now I'm proud of the right fact we have footage inside
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:29.720]  the courtroom and we're having some audio troubles it just got sent to us
[1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:32.440]  from inside the courtroom so for TV viewers and radio listeners this is an
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:37.080]  exclusive inside the Roger Stone courtroom of the judge holding court

[1:59:54.080 --> 2:00:24.000]  I want to apologize to her Lord and Highness Judge Jackson for showing footage inside the courtroom earlier of her giving orders the FBI and others so we're not going to show any more of that we're going to show footage they had the day out
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:27.640]  outside the courtroom when she let people in the media know don't talk about her
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:33.000]  trying to put Obama officials and others on the jury and all the little little
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:36.880]  people kind of ran away at this happening and the judge made an
[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:40.560]  incredible entrance and exit this is real footage from outside the federal
[2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:55.360]  courthouse in DC just a couple days ago exclusive from a surveillance camera here it is
[2:00:55.360 --> 2:01:17.360]  I thought you said she was dead that was her sister the wicked witch of the east this is the wicked witch of the west she's worse than the other one who killed my sister who killed the witch of the east
[2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:32.360]  was it you know no it was an accident I didn't mean to kill anybody well my little pretty I can cause accidents too aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers slippers yes slippers
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:49.360]  the ruby slippers what have you done with them give them back to me or I'll it's too late there they are and there they'll stay
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:02:04.360]  back my slippers I am the only one that knows how to use them there are no use to you give them back to me that's Cuomo so you can't read the wiggily
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:33.360]  she wouldn't want them so bad you say out of this blender or I'll fix you as well somebody drops the house on you very well I'll buy my time and as for you my fine lady it's true I can't attend you here and now as I'd like but just try to stay up in my way just try I'll get you my pretty little dog too
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:41.360]  she goes so get that first a minute she'll shut that down
[2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:53.360]  by the way I just realized how they project on everything we had a grim reaper on the show about Epstein did he kill himself or was he killed they said that was a threat I said play random clips of the witch that's the next one they found they'll say oh the house is on the
[2:02:53.360 --> 2:03:05.360]  witch it's a threat no that's called Wizard of Oz you crazy leftist like a town angle and they're renaming from white because the name white Siebel now yeah yeah that was not a threat on the judge either the more I think about it because they can project on
[2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:18.360]  anything yeah no doubt about it they can project a wide range of behaviors on to other people what they themselves would like to do and I think that there's a large aspects of what that what's taking place here is the willingness to weaponize the legal system against fundamental freedoms in the
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:28.360]  country and that you have prominent prosecutors and prominent members of the press urging the arrest of anyone who covers whether there's jury selection bias taking place effectively that's how the story comes across
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:41.360]  in dangerous freedoms for everybody moving forward and definitely means that the impeachment proceeding will not look like anything resembling an American legal system proceeding that protects and recognizes the rights that are enshrined into those institutions
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:50.360]  governing those methods of resolving truth and justice. You're back in the next hour and Owen's here and I want you guys to get back to important work you're working on but do half the next
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:04:02.360]  segment with me it's only a minute break we never got to it what do you think is really going to happen to Roger just from this point and then what could his lawyers do now to stop laying down why don't you get started now we got about a minute.
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:13.360]  Well it looks like a lynching so the question is how do they prevent a lynching and I think it's starting to expose it as such raised questions and challenge and contest any aspect of inadmissible evidence move from mistrials
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:24.360]  wherever possible that this is not a fair proceeding this is not an honest proceeding the I think what they they I think we're entitled to move from mistrial as soon as the prosecution got up and it clearly the court apparently believe that
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:33.360]  Trump was not going to be a central figure in the case I found it hard to believe but that apparently from the published reports of how she handled jury selection she really didn't think people's perceptions of Trump would matter that much in the case
[2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:44.360]  all the prosecutor talked about was Trump for the most part in the opening statement so the that right there was grounds for mistrial they're being totally political they have all their speech Roger has nothing they allow demonstrators that are anti stone
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:55.360]  none that are pro it is a classic discrimination total railroading from hell what is Trump going to do we'll be right back
[2:04:55.360 --> 2:05:14.360]  please support us as well and spread the word about the transmission and remember your financial support is what makes this possible plus we make it easy we have really great products at informer store dot com and we have the Alexa pure breeze that every year around this time we are able to offer at their cost and then we're given a
[2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:29.360]  rebate for the new year when we purchase these without to pay taxes on this is 147 is the cost with free shipping they've never done a deal that good it's a hot item they sell tens of thousands of these a year it's a four stage ion cluster other competing brands
[2:05:29.360 --> 2:05:45.360]  $400 $500 $600 $700 all the markup no ladies and gentlemen we usually sell these all day long for 250 they're a great deal 147 I almost told the guy like this cuts into the market so just low people don't appreciate it well this is what the informer's audience gets
[2:05:45.360 --> 2:06:00.360]  informer store dot com there's only a few hundred of these left at this price and then more to come in until next year
[2:06:00.360 --> 2:06:20.360]  so defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones I don't have a little too much fun here I was just paralleling the tyranny of this judge in my first minute view my evil American
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:35.360]  opinion member when we could have those we still do exercise them you have them trying to extinct that behavior but not not without a political fight but I said hey play something with the wicked wish and the flying monkeys and I said get her flying on her broom
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:52.360]  I didn't find that clip which is okay they had like 20 seconds they found her arriving at the Munchkin operation well I forgot there's a witch with a house on top so they say everything's a threat here you know which it's not a threat again I had the Grim Reaper on about Epstein on the show
[2:06:52.360 --> 2:07:07.360]  and they said that was a threat to the judge or jury or something and so now let's just get out ahead of that that I'm not planning would never want the harm of the judge and I'm not gonna drop a house on top of them so you don't have to confiscate my house from me but that's what the media does
[2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:23.360]  and I've never threatened the jury when they were trying to appoint a Obama official to it I guess she'd done it we talked about it that's under the law we did our job it's not like I did something bad it's not like Don Junior did something bad we're just the ones that have the courage to research what it is to be an American and to do it
[2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:38.360]  and thanks to you betting on us and supporting us and spreading the word we're here fighting and I gotta say we are the tip of the spear you are the tip of the spear viewers and listeners but Barnes you were explaining why they did this why the Washington Post CNN Obama officials calling for my arrest I mean this is insane
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:54.360]  anyone that was doing anyone that was calling for the criminalization of discussing jury selection bias is someone who was trying to silence suppress and chill speech related to the fact that this trial is not being handled in a manner that is consistent to the constitutional
[2:07:54.360 --> 2:08:09.360]  rights of Roger Stone or to the purposes of transparency and truth and justice that our criminal justice process supposed to be about I'm a big believer in the American criminal justice process and this doesn't look anything like it from the standard of what the Constitution requires and compels of that process
[2:08:09.360 --> 2:08:32.360]  and there's no one people talking about because most people would be disturbed and bothered by the idea that in a highly political case where Donald Trump is the centerpiece of the case that people who had a bias against Donald Trump and against Republicans were routinely being seated on the jury while people who had any kind of Republican connection were being removed from the jury
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:46.360]  and that's all on record the judge was saying this it was in Reuters it was in Politico the same word for word thing and we're like Obama official whose husband was on the Miller investigation that's a conflict of interest and their answer is arrest him
[2:08:46.360 --> 2:08:59.360]  what planet are we on thank God these it's like Lindsey Graham I'm not a big fan of but he said during the cabinet he said you people want power and thank God you don't have it I'd hate to see what would happen if you had all three branches of government I mean these people are frickin dangerous
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:10.360]  and by definition none of this can be jury tampering because the jury is not supposed to be watching any media at all they're specifically instructed and taken an oath that they're not watching it so this isn't communication to the jury this is communication to the court of public opinion
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:23.360]  saying look at this railroading absolutely which is exactly what the role of the press has been prominent legal scholars have been saying this for over half a century and as goes Roger Stone goes the president in the country as goes
[2:09:23.360 --> 2:09:37.360]  Kavanaugh was the better test of just people lying with no evidence this man raped me and later actually never happened never met the guy there was there were huge evidentiary flaws the reason why they want all these things to be secret is they don't want the evidentiary flaws to come out
[2:09:37.360 --> 2:09:47.360]  they don't want the reasons to realize that the you told me last night you said I bet there's there's the people even worse on that jury absolutely I mean that jury transcript should be released you know the if you want to tell folks what you're thinking about doing
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:56.360]  well the I may make an appearance in the case or have someone else make an appearance directly in the case to ask for the entire transcript of that jury selection process to be revealed
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:10:00.360]  because you're part of big national groups that do that mainly when you're fighting the KKK
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:02.360]  correct or all of those and explain how that works
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:15.360]  sure so the jury transcript is supposed to be released to the public and supposed to be available if they want to redact individual names then they can under certain circumstances of the person sits on the jury until seven days after the verdict is over
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:24.360]  but otherwise that information should be available to see one whether people lied to get on the jury the whether people that had political motivations against Roger Stoneman
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:38.360]  I mean that happened this night's case three different jurors lied to get on the jury and confessed to other jurors that they did that they had a bias about the case and hit it from the inception so this happens all the time sadly so this should be fully investigated fully vetted to make sure the jury selection process
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:43.360]  and they're telling you something that's a mainstay of America is not supposed to happen
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:51.360]  right I mean they're letting jurors on the jury by what has been published to date that would appear to have every reason to be prejudiced against Roger Stoneman
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:52.360]  have every reason to be prejudiced
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:55.360]  and even correct me wrong under law even the appearance they're supposed to be struck
[2:10:55.360 --> 2:11:09.360]  absolutely and only then here you have a prosecutor who somehow got the judge convinced that Donald Trump wasn't a critical role so they didn't have to even explore and questions what the jury thought about Donald Trump and then his whole opening statement is about Trump
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  I mean it's and the judge ruled that stone even though there's proof there was no Russia gates don't want to show they never had proof proof that there was a Russian hack and the judge said that doesn't matter Russia gate doesn't matter now they're making it all about Russia gate
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:31.360]  the second thing is Roger Stoneman should now be allowed to speak to the public about his own trial the jury cannot watch or participate or observe anything that's happening so nothing but they know full well they probably got big screen TVs rolled into them
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:37.360]  not unless they're violating the constitutional in my experience jurors usually abide by that obligation
[2:11:37.360 --> 2:11:47.360]  I'm talking about they're putting out that I'm threatening them in they're using the media saying I'm threatening jury so they can tell them we hear there's threats from Jones and they're playing clips of me in there
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:57.360]  they shouldn't relate any of that information because that's an attempt to bias and prejudice the jury so if somebody's doing I've had Marshalls do that sort of thing sadly in certain proceedings court officials try to do it and it has to be fully exposed
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:01.360]  because there should no communication like that should be going on to the jury
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:09.360]  all right well amazing gentlemen I've got a lot of other huge news to cover Owen's gonna be hosting the war room today 3 to 6pm he used to have a co-host but they arrested him he's facing trial
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:22.360]  we got a lot of other stuff to cover but other observations you made at this kangaroo event I mean the fact that she lets them right wing watch plug the giant rat in you know and they've got the floating rat in front of everybody
[2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:29.360]  the guy that ate our microphone and they can jump out at Roger every day but no one else that supports Roger can be anywhere I mean this is just sick
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:41.360]  well I think Alex this is their game plan for you now we see in other cases they just say that you're threatening people even though you never have and then that's what's used against you but that's kind of just a side issue that we see here
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:55.360]  but you know all of America here's why judge Jackson wants everybody silenced on this case because in a fair world in a just world there'd be hundreds of thousands of protesters outside of that courtroom every day saying this judge should be removed
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:13:07.360]  all of our freedoms are being raped that a lot of men paid for with blood and a lot of women and children's husbands never came home for these damn rights and these people are literally slipping this country's throat
[2:13:07.360 --> 2:13:33.360]  and so she knows that she can hold Roger Stone hostage essentially and threaten your first amendment right she's saying look I've got Roger your buddy over here on the news I'll hang him you better not talk about me Alex you better not talk about me you better not talk about my rigged jury you better not talk about the rigged prosecution you better not talk about my rigged courtroom I've got Roger's head in the news right here and I'll talk him to death
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:47.360]  the media sycophantically worship her and say how dare Jones call her a fraud she's like the left worships the intelligence agency and worships the black robes the real liberals used to fear that and have checks and balances now they love it
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:14:01.360]  and I think and for example none of this is calling and no one should communicate directly with the judge that doesn't have any effect at all and would backfire and would be bad idea what people should do is communicate in the court of public opinion whether what's happening in the judicial system is consistent
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:14.360]  oh we know she's that that woman that judges a slave of the deep state where we would never want to communicate with her it's like talking to the Satan I mean give me a bright no we're just exposed to America what a danger this authoritarian leftist judiciary is
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:28.360]  and the whole nature of the system in terms of weaponizing the law what the other thing is you see the left when a judge rules against them they then the left goes after them all entirely you look at what how the left treated Justice Khalia over 25 years so the left has no
[2:14:28.360 --> 2:14:40.360]  right it is death I mean oh you had lots of people on social media celebrating his death oh the left saw kill Trump kill Alex Jones destroy them go to their homes attack the members of Congress they kill stab the leader of the Senate in the heart
[2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:53.360]  they had that works for Scalia in the wiggly cut Trump's head off all that's good and then we have a grim reaper on the show and they say it's a threat when it has nothing to do with what we even talked about it just shows you how again they have people on CNN's
[2:14:53.360 --> 2:15:09.360]  NBC saying go to their houses flatten Trump supporters Scalice has been shot Rand Paul has his ribs broken lung punctured and members of Congress celebrate it the Hollywood bet middler says you know once he's dead oh but we're threatening them
[2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:23.360]  damn it that Alex Jones has millions of listeners and he's effective and they just got Trump in office shut him down and you know what now some of his listeners are getting active and now they've got thousands of audience members shut them down too
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:33.360]  shut up you Americans crawling your hole and shut up by the way you better let your loving child sit on this drag Queens lap with a full erection otherwise you're a bigot
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:40.360]  that town's called white what the hell will change the name run away yes sir
[2:15:40.360 --> 2:15:51.360]  the name Lynch was on the hall because it's an old name and oh no it's cancel Lynch cancel Lynchburg everything do everything first amendment put John Jackson in charge of everything

[2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:31.360]  nobody has I'll tell you about it at the end of the transmission today and things are so important on this whole 5g 60 thing I'm going to come in this weekend on just on top of the Sunday show we always do four to six I just I've got to do a
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:46.360]  whole report for you that's totally focused here I was quite a shot done with us because he's been heavy on the Epstein thing I wanted to get Leo Zagami investigative journalist bestselling author on four years before the Vatican brought in the new pope out of the
[2:22:46.360 --> 2:23:03.360]  Jesuit order he exposed it all and he is a political target Leo Zagami dot com he joins a Zagami blocked on Facebook after we're posting an old post of Epstein that predicted his murder by the royal family in the
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:19.360]  20s they went in and blocked him on Facebook as he's frozen out of it right now they may completely banned him for doing that and there's something else they do they admit this Facebook Twitter and Fox won't let you say the name of the fake whistleblower Eric
[2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:35.360]  Zagami the fake whistleblower you pronounce it right even though it's totally legal totally lawful they're calling for Don Junior's arrest even though it was already in the news so they want my arrest they want his arrest this is all going on you're not supposed to talk about this you're
[2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:48.360]  right it's really what it is so Leo Zagami I know you're an expert on the international pedophile rings how this giant satanic Ponzi scheme works how they corrupt people and it looks like with the deputy pope in trouble in a secret trial in
[2:23:48.360 --> 2:24:02.360]  Australia and all the things that the dominoes are falling that the House of Cards is beginning to implode they're striking back at Donald Trump at you at me and everybody trying to arrest you arrest me that's really a badge of honor what would you call the position the dark forces of
[2:24:02.360 --> 2:24:21.360]  satan are in right now it's a position of course of dominance still because they have the mainstream media in their hands they still have most of the intelligence community also on their side unfortunately but we are of course fighting them
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:37.360]  back and so they're very scared and that's why they are resorting to censorship which is in a democracy the worst thing you can ever do and and that's where we are at now unfortunately you literally pioneered all of this when I heard you 20 years ago
[2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:51.360]  first on air about the international crime rings using the pedophilia of British intelligence how they took control the Vatican I agree they're still in dominant position but that can end any day like Hitler was in a dominant position 1945 till he wasn't I mean I think they can see their
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:58.360]  foundations eroding quickly and much of the facade falling away with their evil face now exposed.
[2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:16.360]  Well they will resort to any means to stop us and so at the moment I have just published an article talking about John leccarelli this book which actually aims at Brexit and Trump and he's a very famous novelist is the most
[2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:34.360]  known in the spine gender together with Ian Fleming and he's been talking against Trump in this new novel in a way which is appalling at what at one point he says that the English are basically it's it's I can't even say it on the air they are
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:44.360]  sucking on basically on Trump's penis because the British government the British people are performing fellatio on Trump.
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:26:01.360]  On Trump and they are inviting of course Trump to have tea with the queen and they are doing Brexit which in the eyes of John leccarelli who used to be a master spy in the MI5 and MI6 is is of course wrong like all these
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:16.360]  well it shows how desperate they are they don't want us getting out of their corrupt world government let's get back to Epstein Facebook blocking your report when you called it all how are you able to call it all people can find the report on your site you should get it reposted and screenshots of them blocking you tell us
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:35.360]  what happened well in early July just after I came and visited you in Austin I of course heard of the rest of Epstein and my first thought was he's going to be a whack he's going to be killed by the British intelligence because of Prince
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:50.360]  Gabriel and and and the Clintons will help him out so I just made a post on the ninth of July regarding all this and let's remember that Jeffrey Epstein was well he was in prison but he was well and so nobody was thinking he would be
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:27:07.360]  killed but I wrote that and I posted there like you do when you are on social media and he got a few likes and so on but the day before yesterday I thought with all the new things that are all the new information coming out regarding the
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:25.360]  relationship imposed by Buckingham Palace on the Epstein case I wanted to repost so posted to just show the people that anybody everybody knew that Epstein will be killed but of course pointing also on the British intelligence as the main people that
[2:27:25.360 --> 2:27:41.360]  could do this kind of operation conduct this kind of operation so I posted it and after a few minutes I started to notice that my main account was having problems and then I was not allowed to post any longer but they were
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:55.360]  not even telling me why they just banned me from from posting and it's been like that since two days ago and then I have another emergency profile because you see I have been since for many years it's not the first time I've been
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:11.360]  since on social network networks I had five accounts by 2012 2013 I had already many accounts closed down so they were definitely after what I was saying on the international
[2:28:11.360 --> 2:28:25.360]  they're they're they're protecting fake whistleblowers they're protecting pedophile kingpins they're protecting evil and that's what Facebook Google and Twitter are is monstrous organizations and everybody should know it and if people support them in this you support protecting
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:35.360]  the pedophiles they know good and damn well what they're doing you should be getting a Pulitzer prize for your work Leo I mean it's ridiculous how accurate you've been when you come back I want to get more predictions from you and have

[2:32:12.360 --> 2:32:27.360]  we've had Oxford come out and banned clapping the ADL and others will literally bankrupt you kick you out of college destroy you have you arrested in some areas if you do the OK symbol that's the international sign language symbol for OK

[2:32:43.360 --> 2:32:56.360]  it's a great way to start conversations info wars dot com is on the back get yours today at info wars store dot com and support free speech by supporting info wars while having a great hat
[2:32:56.360 --> 2:33:06.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:33:06.360 --> 2:33:20.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover up you want to stop tyranny will so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones
[2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:33.360]  it's not a coming and I'm sure you're right to shotgun Owen Leo's right the globalist are still in the down position but as they're exposed they get weaker and weaker and they're trying to bring forward classical tyranny
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:43.360]  it's work some in Europe but that caused a big backlash I don't think it's going to work here I think it's going to be rough for those of us that are the leaders of the resistance
[2:33:43.360 --> 2:33:55.360]  it's not about taking one for the team but I'm not really taking one for the team letting evil take over folks is not something I'm going to let my children or your children go through so it's not like we're heroes fighting this this is what everybody should be doing
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:34:07.360]  well there should be a survival instinct to do this and I think that the problem is a lot of people don't have their survival instincts anymore and so this is the chemicals in the water this is the chemicals in the food
[2:34:07.360 --> 2:34:19.360]  and so they're just dumb they're docile the flicker rates at the TV they're they're attached to whatever is on their favorite social they're asleep on their cell phone and so they don't have their survival instincts anymore or they're it's like a chilling effect
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:30.360]  well I don't want to talk about that I'll get banned off Facebook oh I don't want to mention that my friends will think I'm weird oh I don't want to do that people will say I'm associated with a white supremacist group
[2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:38.360]  so so this is what they've done in the media to censor silence and chill free speech and then you don't have a survival instinct anymore
[2:34:38.360 --> 2:34:46.360]  but what happens your phone runs out of battery and all of a sudden like that's your survival instinct ticking in like oh my gosh what's going on here
[2:34:46.360 --> 2:35:01.360]  but you said Alex exposure is what we can see people that's why they're censoring it that's why when Leo Zagami shows hey look here I am you know a few years back like everybody else saying yeah Epstein is probably going to get
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:14.360]  banned on these top pedophile networks that involve royalty and you know top officials in the west to and then oh what do you know they kill them and then oh what do you know they ban Leo so it's pretty obvious to see what's going on this is the
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:28.360]  bad ABC and Brian Stelter saying ABC to the right thing we don't want to cover Epstein Epstein's not bad they're they're really out in the open right now Leo what do you think is coming next
[2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:42.360]  well what is coming next is even more coming out from the closet with all their evil let's see what has happened in the last few weeks in Rome since they have placed Moloch in in front of everybody right in the
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:53.360]  that's another reason I want to get you on that somewhere in my stack pull that up they put the deity of child sacrifice which wasn't even Roman in front of the Colosseum what the hell
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:36:11.360]  yes and they are of course justifying it by saying they are doing an exhibition on the Cartagena's on the Phoenicians and that this is just a cultural thing but we all know that to have the statue of Moloch placed in the Colosseum
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:27.360]  which is also used by the Pope each year on Easter Friday means you need to have approval from the Pope himself so I have been really talking with a lot of people in Italy who are completely shocked and appalled but also there is a growing
[2:36:27.360 --> 2:36:43.360]  number of tourists who are entering the Colosseum watching Moloch and saying what is this the statue by the way was picked up from a movie that came out over a hundred years ago and there was a movie written by a guy called
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:59.360]  Gabriele D'Annuncio who is one of the founders of fascism who to practice sexual magic on himself had even some a couple of ribs removed so he could have philatio on himself so it's not that
[2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:11.360]  let's go further I've seen some of that really scary old silent movie footage of children being thrown to Moloch that's the same one guys what's the name of the movie we'll pull it up it's on YouTube it's really scary
[2:37:11.360 --> 2:37:39.360]  let me describe you what you're seeing here you're seeing a ritualist from this cult it was the right of Moloch practice by the ancient Phoenicians and you have a hundred children ready to be sacrificed
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:59.360]  together with the protagonist of the film who are a couple of people who a young person who gets kidnapped from Sicily and brought down to North Africa what where it was of course the Cartagian had their city and that's what you're seeing
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:17.360]  the film is the statue of Moloch which basically represents this deity which we all know it's described often also in the Old Testament regarding child sacrifice so placing this in the Colosseum in the center of Christianity in a place so important for
[2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:27.360]  Christian martyrdom means really that we have reached the end times for sure there is no coming back from something like this
[2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:36.360]  this guy was a fascist founder a devil worshiper I remember reading about him who removed two of his ribs to perform basically black magic rituals and servicing himself
[2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:52.360]  and a member of secret societies that are part of the Illuminati Network like the Martinist he was also a 33rd degree Freemason but he was a guy obsessed into the occult side of Freemason which is not what all Freemasons follow
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:39:00.360]  I understand George Washington warned of that the satanic takeover we understand that we know it goes back to Solomon and beyond that and a lot of people don't understand that
[2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:11.360]  now Leo this is incredible I'm glad you mentioned this I'd forgotten this film that same statue has been brought in because the word is when I read about this is they actually did real rituals in and around this film
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:19.360]  and some reports were that they were killing real children later just like at Bohemian Grove they simulated but really do it for real later this is a big deal
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:34.360]  yeah because five years after this film came out Gabriel D'Annunzio managed to invade and conquer the city of Fiume and basically he placed there his own little government
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:48.360]  and it became the headquarters of all the deviant forces in the Illuminati in Europe for over a year you had Satanist occultists all kinds of people which is coming to this
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:58.360]  and wasn't this all going on during the takeover of Italy when they were taking everybody's land and murdering people en masse which later triggered Mussolini who came out of the movement to then resist it, correct?
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:11.360]  of course this was a fundamental part of the creation of the fascist myth when he arrived in Fiume together with his Arditi and then it became the basis of...
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:17.360]  Hitler, Hitler, Hitler came from literal devil worship and what viewers just saw
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:24.360]  yes because Hitler of course was inspired by all this for his own Nazi empire that he wanted
[2:40:24.360 --> 2:40:32.360]  I'd forgotten all this is what me and Leo can finish each other's sentences I've just read this in mainline history you read a real mainline book about Mussolini it's all in there
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:47.360]  yeah it's all in there and what happened is that in 1924 though Mussolini made a deal with the Jesuits and at that point he started to persecute the people who helped him going into power
[2:40:47.360 --> 2:40:51.360]  he switched sides first he was the leftist and then he switched on him
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:40:58.360]  yeah he switched and basically at that point started also the persecution of Freemasonry in Italy the lodges were destroyed
[2:40:58.360 --> 2:41:02.360]  which Hitler also did exactly
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:15.360]  and Mussolini became a tool of the Vatican he signed the Lateran Pax that became the basis for this new treaty between Italy and the Vatican because there was no treaty with the Vatican up until that point
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:22.360]  and see Leo that's why you gotta come up for like three hours sometime to do a whole special in history because you've lived it you've been involved in all of the different levels you've exposed the good parts the bad parts
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:32.360]  people don't get that whether it's the Vatican or whether it's Masonry or whether it's Jewry or whether it's any major movement there is the different factions and then really there's only two ancient factions fighting each other
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:40.360]  and all groups become manifestations of those two fighting and that's why to always oversimplify one group behind things is ignorance
[2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:45.360]  yes and also we had the SS which were inspired by the Jesuits
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:46.360]  absolutely
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:51.360]  the SS of him so I mean we have also that important faction in this occult war
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:54.360]  it's not inspired he fashioned them after the Jesuits
[2:41:54.360 --> 2:42:05.360]  yeah he fashioned them but then he was the SS got inspired by the most occult and deviant forces when they created the immeasurable castle this base
[2:42:05.360 --> 2:42:17.360]  which was used by the way again by pedophiles like Michael Aquino in the early 80s who went there and celebrated black masses in this castle
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:27.360]  that's why the SS castle they cut blonde or blue like children's head off believing they could take the psychic force and then port in in the future while gazing into the eyes of the child
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:30.360]  during the point of the spirit leaving the body they believed
[2:42:30.360 --> 2:42:37.360]  well come back and this is all mainline history by the way folks the Nazis the communists Lenin was a Satanist they're all coming for your children

[2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:18.360]  well I just want to make a final comment about some we're having in the break and then Leo can close us out here you know we played that clip from the old movie the Moloch child sacrifices they just put that Moloch statue in front of the Roman Coliseum I hadn't even heard about that
[2:53:18.360 --> 2:53:24.360]  it's just shocking as people just start asking after the one that real kids got killed at reportedly by these proto Nazi groups
[2:53:24.360 --> 2:53:33.360]  and it's just like well what the heck is going on here so but watching this ritual you know these are ancient rituals that used to take place all across the world I mean they're well documented in history
[2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:43.360]  but we don't have to go through something like that anymore that's too extreme I mean overall as humans we have more of a consciousness and a moral code I think they just celebrate abortion all over the news
[2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:57.360]  yeah so that's what it is so it's just like celebrate abortion and you know look for the average person that has an abortion that doesn't necessarily mean that you're evil or whatever you got your own problems but overall as a society as a civilization for us to be celebrating abortion like this freak here at a
[2:53:57.360 --> 2:54:11.360]  no you said it if you don't know and get tricked then the God judges the heart that's why in law we have intent but when you know it and the left now calls it a religion and they say on on on TV let's hurt that baby it's fine I like to bully my baby I like to kill my baby
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:20.360]  that is Satanism and you are damned to hell when you do that no we don't well we don't throw babies into a fiery effigy of Moe
[2:54:20.360 --> 2:54:28.360]  we just have big ugly disgusting men call themselves a woman and then they go don't don't speak out against a woman while she celebrates murdering a baby with a demon face
[2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:36.360]  we just bring out drag queen story time on good morning America to do a strip tease for adults we just have we just drool over you at nine year old boys
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:42.360]  a salute to abortion where they march into a parade and celebrate how they kill babies so that's the new modern day Molok exercise
[2:54:42.360 --> 2:54:47.360]  sorry you're just making me jump in because you're so right oh and Leo he's on fire
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:55:02.360]  yeah I mean it's completely right and at the same time we see the left increasing the rhetoric the anti Trump rhetoric and even if the son of Donald Trump post on Twitter something that has been post previously by
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:16.360]  drudge reported and it gets accused of having exposed the whistleblower I mean it's becoming really obvious that we are standing with the right side of history and they are not
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:29.360]  but the more it goes on and the more we're gonna see their rhetoric transforming in evil acts because they still have power and they're gonna grab to this power until they have it and they are becoming desperate
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:47.360]  so this is dangerous and of course the Vatican is in control but also the Queen of England is controlled Epstein has not killed himself but if there is one person in the world who knows who killed Jeffrey Epstein that person is called Queen Elizabeth the second
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:56:02.360]  oh British Royals never kill anybody there's sweet breakdown the relationship you think Epstein was Massad MI6 or CIA the word I've got is originally British intelligence and that's why he was hanging out with that Maxwell chick
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:22.360]  well and a lot of people don't know that the Clintons were enrolled in British intelligence during their time in London that's why their daughter is called Chelsea so I mean we have here the evil British emperor is now celebrating their Commonwealth
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:37.360]  better on day soon in charge of murdering somebody simply because they want to protect Prince Andrew because the mother says oh Prince Andrew has to be protected so let's just kill people like Epstein who cannot be
[2:56:37.360 --> 2:56:50.360]  you agree with me that Epstein I've never seen a zeitgeist this big it totally took the blinders off I walk down the street anywhere now it's like fight club they go Alex Jones you were right I apologize Epstein they killed him you're right they're all pedophiles Hillary can go I mean it's totally
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:57:01.360]  woke people up and I'm not saying oh they say I'm right now that's the bellwether I'm like a gauge out there a sensor people are really going you're right Alex Alex you're right you're right Alex you're right I mean it's crazy
[2:57:01.360 --> 2:57:20.360]  you're right Alex and we are right in having done all this work during these years to prove and to dig dirt on these people who are ruining the planet but now it's becoming obvious that this is gonna probably become a civil war on the long run if they impeach Trump
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:32.360]  Trump of course that was my next question back in two minutes to five more minutes with both of you civil war they wanted Trump admits it's happening the Democrats say they want to physical and how do we avert that if we can't how do you see that unfolding both of you'll have two and a half minutes

[2:58:46.360 --> 2:59:09.360]  the witch queen of the deep state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant and the corporate whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile in blackmail rings thought that her victory was assured now that the enemy lost that election they are awake and throwing everything they've got at us and conservatives
[2:59:09.360 --> 2:59:27.360]  to christians and patriots many of them are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag ladies and gentlemen we just lost Kentucky governorship we just lost the Virginia State House the first time in 30 years this is serious we can win again and secure the gains we've gotten or we can see it all washed down the drain
[2:59:27.360 --> 2:59:43.360]  whatever you do get more politically activated than you ever have and spread the live links at fan dot video and info wars dot com port slash show if you want to defeat the deep state the globalist then get fired up
[2:59:43.360 --> 3:00:09.360]  fan dot video you're listening to the alex jones show news analysis reports it's the alex jones show coming up i actually agree with pears morgan the planets have aligned
[3:00:09.360 --> 3:00:23.360]  thanks to the town is named white and it shouldn't be banned leo zegami you brought up civil war the globalist the left hand path they know they're losing the lost ones think they can control us they'll find the absolution which isn't not true
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:33.360]  obviously giving themselves over to God's wills the answer but you talk about revolution violence that's their admitted planets in the wiki leaks from four years ago now it's here what do you expect to happen
[3:00:33.360 --> 3:00:48.360]  well one of the pioneers one of the profits of the race for we all know was Charles Manson and we all know who was Charles Manson and what he did to arrive to that point in which he killed over he got his followers to kill all those people
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:01:09.360]  and so Charles Manson is the prophet of these lip tards and coming from california is a very suited the profit for what we are seeing here depicted on the screen with the dracoin impersonating an abortion just for fun on halloween
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:24.360]  day i mean we are really going towards a division in our society so also division in the united states of america that could become the divided states of america what does that mean means that parts of the united states of america
[3:01:24.360 --> 3:01:44.360]  will of course stand with these hypocrites with the satan with the enemy and they would like to persecute christians so the other part will have to defend themselves and that's why we are inevitably going if trump impeachment moves forward towards this civil war that will divide
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:02:00.360]  our country and in that case we have to be very careful because california northern california holds a silicon valley and holds a lot of the servers in this war which is also an information war we have seen them active in the
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:18.360]  censorship more and more and aside from my official profile being closed down because of the epstein thing the other emergency profile was closed down simply for posting an article regarding pacha mama this idol that was paraded in a procession by the

[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:20.360]  our free speech right well now they're taking away our free speech so what are we left to well first amendment second amendment you have election fraud going on on a massive level you have an illegal impeachment going on right now against
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:37.360]  the 45th president of the united states elected by this republic and what are they doing well they're removing alex jones from social media they're banning info wars they're getting ready to make their big moves and so basically alex is what it's come down to for us is like hey we wanted to take
[3:03:37.360 --> 3:03:52.360]  America back with our first amendment and we still want to take America back with our first amendment but when the first amendment fails you go to the second amendment that's not a threat and that's why they're going to stage false flags before we ever even do that and we
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:04:05.360]  don't you know they're coming for our kids and and they're not going to stop so i think you know i'll close it out with this alex donald trump controls donald trump's destiny if he wants to go down in history as orange man bad then that's on him

[3:11:51.360 --> 3:12:07.360]  something where we're having fun and you know Leo Zagami's on a big reporter from Italy and he's telling me about a mohawk in a famous 1920s film with child sacrifice run by the founder of the fascist movement that created Mussolini and Hitler
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:22.360]  and then doing satanic ceremonies with Hitler and I was finishing his sentences we weren't making that up to be scary that's where this comes from Lenin was a satanist he said he was Hitler was a satanist
[3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:44.360]  Mussolini was a satanist their devil worshipers do you understand why the hell would they put up electromagnetic radiation that gives everybody cancer because they want to kill everybody they want to do it slow they want to be able to turn it up and turn it down and watch what it does
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:13:01.360]  and they don't care if it hurts them they want to hurt their bodies take one look at one of their servants who they are this isn't a game of people we've all gotten punch drunk I'm proud they want me arrested all over the news

[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:23.360]  here's part of the piece we put together from the film a face in the crowd this is what the globalist media really thinks of you and they claim they love you and they care about you it's all a sick joke here it is

[3:19:53.360 --> 3:20:17.360]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:17.360 --> 3:20:27.360]  I know I've been wound up today folks and maybe the three cups of coffee I've had part of it but when they're all over the news saying you're a criminal and they want to put you in federal prison.
[3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:31.360]  They're all over the news dreaming of the destruction of your family.
[3:20:31.360 --> 3:20:47.360]  Let's just walk up to you and spit on you say after your family your face just gives you a lot of energy doesn't make me scared it makes me just have too much energy and want to fight too much and Millie Weaver called me this morning.
[3:20:47.360 --> 3:21:03.360]  And she began to put me on three way of these recordings at the Secretary of State's office in Kentucky and there's hours of this and she told me the whole case and I was looking it up at the time and confirming everything she was telling me from the news and this happened.
[3:21:03.360 --> 3:21:23.360]  Months ago, the Democrat suit and got 175,000 names put back on the voter rolls of people that were dead or living outside the state and they said oh it's just people that, you know, haven't voted in a while.
[3:21:23.360 --> 3:21:43.360]  And it turns out it was Republicans that had moved to other states or it was their husbands or wives that weren't even citizens but they use the DMV database just like they caught them in California with lawsuits and for your request by judicial watch they got the documents remember that.
[3:21:43.360 --> 3:21:49.360]  They found three plus million from California alone voted the names of dead people or folks that have moved out of the state.
[3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:54.360]  They have all these Democrat election heads over the years caught on video by Veritas and others admitting it.
[3:21:54.360 --> 3:21:57.360]  They can usually get one person to vote 10 times.
[3:21:57.360 --> 3:22:05.360]  So you wonder there's no crowds for the Democrats huge crowds for Trump because of election fraud and Republicans in the Justice Department won't do anything.
[3:22:05.360 --> 3:22:16.360]  So Millie's got a bigger video coming out she's got one up on info wars.com breaking new evidence confirms Kentucky election fraud.
[3:22:16.360 --> 3:22:25.360]  Immigrants taken from DMV database and enrolled as voters and then people vote magically in their names.
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:29.360]  Non-citizens being added to voter registration from DMV database there it is.
[3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:32.360]  Now that's the first interview she posted it's key.
[3:22:32.360 --> 3:22:41.360]  It's like seven minutes long she's got a big one going up Millie great job you and the team working so hard to tell us the latest and when this big reports coming out this is so huge.
[3:22:41.360 --> 3:22:46.360]  And of course it's bombshell that the people they put back on had never voted.
[3:22:46.360 --> 3:22:50.360]  I mean that that shows it's not people that they were told was inactive.
[3:22:50.360 --> 3:22:58.360]  They've gone and skimmed a bunch of names out of the DMV people that aren't even citizens and put them on there.
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:03.360]  And you just know the governor's only lost by close to 5000 votes.
[3:23:03.360 --> 3:23:06.360]  You know they stole it and you know he needs to get into this.
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:14.360]  This is huge Millie we could turn this around and defeat them and stop them from defrauding the voters of Kentucky Millie.
[3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:18.360]  Well you know Andy Beshear the attorney general of Kentucky.
[3:23:18.360 --> 3:23:27.360]  It was his office that was the one that actually did the lawsuit to get the 175,000 purged voters back on the rolls.
[3:23:27.360 --> 3:23:31.360]  So of course it seems a little bit like he had something to gain there don't you think Alex.
[3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:37.360]  And it is pretty suspicious that they just any immigrant who goes to the DMV and gets a driver's license.
[3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:40.360]  They just include them in the voter registration rolls.
[3:23:40.360 --> 3:23:46.360]  However there's a box they can check to exclude people who are under 18 from the voter rolls.
[3:23:46.360 --> 3:23:50.360]  So why aren't they doing that with the immigrants who are even ineligible to vote.
[3:23:50.360 --> 3:23:53.360]  They just say oh well it's just on them to choose not to vote.
[3:23:53.360 --> 3:24:02.360]  Well we're just going to blindly hope that nobody commits election fraud when half the time you go to these election polls
[3:24:02.360 --> 3:24:08.360]  and the Democrats or the people there are saying oh yeah yeah it doesn't matter if you're illegal immigrant or if you're an immigrant.
[3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:10.360]  You can vote yeah sure go ahead.
[3:24:10.360 --> 3:24:13.360]  Most of these uninformed citizens just walk in there.
[3:24:13.360 --> 3:24:20.360]  They vote and then they don't realize they're committing a crime which could actually get them deported if they're even legal immigrants.
[3:24:20.360 --> 3:24:23.360]  Well Millie so it's a major problem. Absolutely.
[3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:29.360]  I mean as soon as you were telling me this morning we're on the phone listening to the recordings and later live calling back to the governor's office
[3:24:29.360 --> 3:24:31.360]  and then the Secretary of State's office.
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:35.360]  I was searching this and confirming and people said hey these are people who moved out of the state.
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:36.360]  These are dead people.
[3:24:36.360 --> 3:24:43.360]  The judge just said do it and then now we learn it's your friends who's a citizen's husband who's not a citizen.
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:44.360]  He's never voted.
[3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:48.360]  He's saying to the investigator I'm scared and we've got the recordings.
[3:24:48.360 --> 3:24:51.360]  I'm scared if you vote illegally you can get kicked out of the country.
[3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:54.360]  I didn't vote but he's on there and they're saying they did vote.
[3:24:54.360 --> 3:24:57.360]  So this is you know this is it.
[3:24:57.360 --> 3:24:58.360]  We've got them.
[3:24:58.360 --> 3:25:02.360]  So the governor is recanvassing to see if the votes were cast.
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:03.360]  Well what about who cast them.
[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:04.360]  That's the investigation.
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:10.360]  They've got to go into that database and look at who's out of the state or who is in the citizen and it's over.
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:14.360]  That will disqualify the votes and the governor will win like he was supposed to.
[3:25:14.360 --> 3:25:24.360]  Well what's scary is in 2016 Tori she actually went through the process of trying to get herself removed from the voter rolls in Kentucky.
[3:25:24.360 --> 3:25:30.360]  She sent in a notarized form paper everything that she signed to have herself removed.
[3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:39.360]  And then when she went to go check it now recently they said she was put back on the rolls and she's like well why was I even put back on the rolls.
[3:25:39.360 --> 3:25:40.360]  This is ridiculous.
[3:25:40.360 --> 3:25:43.360]  I haven't lived in Kentucky for over eight years.
[3:25:43.360 --> 3:25:48.360]  They said oh it was because of this recent purge lawsuit that they brought everyone back onto the rolls.
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:49.360]  And then you called more.
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:51.360]  I got more investigators on from the state.
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:54.360]  They all told you the same thing which is confirmed.
[3:25:54.360 --> 3:25:55.360]  This is incredible.
[3:25:55.360 --> 3:25:57.360]  This is incredible.
[3:25:57.360 --> 3:26:08.360]  And they did say the Kentucky Board of Elections staffers said that they are going to be investigating and looking into why her immigrant husband was even registered to begin with.
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:19.360]  And it's important to note both her and her immigrant husband who's ineligible to vote were registered as Democrats and put on the rolls.
[3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:30.360]  Despite the fact that neither of them have lived in Kentucky for over eight years and they moved from OK so from Kentucky to then Oregon to North Dakota.
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:34.360]  She checked Oregon's records and Oregon had removed them.
[3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:39.360]  That's right. And again your friend is mad about the illegal voting. You told me I talked to her.
[3:26:39.360 --> 3:26:40.360]  She double checked.
[3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:42.360]  She wanted to make sure someone wasn't stealing her identity.
[3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:44.360]  We should all be like her.
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:45.360]  And then she caught him.
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:48.360]  She caught him and her husband's completely freaked out.
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:49.360]  He wants to stay here.
[3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:50.360]  Obviously he's law abiding.
[3:26:50.360 --> 3:26:52.360]  This is incredible.
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:27:02.360]  And again as you said right now because if they did commit voter fraud in her husband's name that could actually put his immigration status in jeopardy.
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:04.360]  He reported it but absolutely.
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:05.360]  This is a Democrat judge.
[3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:06.360]  They'll probably try to have him executed.
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:07.360]  Millie this is in.
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:10.360]  I mean this is a judicial watch when we come back.
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:11.360]  I'll show you all this.
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:13.360]  I know you already know they did lawsuits everywhere.
[3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:17.360]  They found three plus million just in a few canvass areas of California.
[3:27:17.360 --> 3:27:19.360]  There was a small part that were voting illegally.
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:22.360]  So Trump said hey Hillary stole about three million.
[3:27:22.360 --> 3:27:25.360]  That was only California Millie.
[3:27:25.360 --> 3:27:32.360]  Yeah you know Matt Blevins has only lost the race by a mere five thousand votes.
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:36.360]  And the Democrats and the rhinos are both saying oh you need to concede.
[3:27:36.360 --> 3:27:37.360]  You need to throw it in.
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:38.360]  Give it to the guy.
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:40.360]  What's wrong with you.
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:45.360]  You know Matt Blevins needs to demand that they investigate this last minute.
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:46.360]  Well let's not just investigate.
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:51.360]  They have a national ID database that tells who's in what state the Democrats knew.
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:52.360]  They go in.
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:53.360]  That's what they use it for.
[3:27:53.360 --> 3:27:54.360]  They've been caught doing this.
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:27:55.360]  They have a national ID database.
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:27:57.360]  They compare it and find out who's how to state who won't know.
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:28:00.360]  Who's been gone at least two years is the model.
[3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:01.360]  They do this.
[3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:02.360]  They have scientific firms do this.
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:04.360]  So they look at voter rolls in other states.
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:05.360]  They compare it.
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:06.360]  They find out who's moved out.
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:08.360]  Then they look at who's there.
[3:28:08.360 --> 3:28:10.360]  Then they hand out the people.
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:11.360]  Okay you're a woman.
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:13.360]  You go vote ten times as these women.
[3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:14.360]  You're a man.
[3:28:14.360 --> 3:28:15.360]  You go vote ten times.
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:17.360]  And so again it's not just dead people.
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:19.360]  That's a small part of it.
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:21.360]  It's having homeless, illegals and Democrat operatives.
[3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:23.360]  Hell they've got videos online with the Democrats saying go down.
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:24.360]  Go to Alabama.
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:25.360]  Go to Kentucky.
[3:28:25.360 --> 3:28:26.360]  Go to Michigan.
[3:28:26.360 --> 3:28:27.360]  Here's how you go and vote.
[3:28:27.360 --> 3:28:31.360]  And then they send in their voter registration cards like they live there using Democrat
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:32.360]  addresses as fraud.
[3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:36.360]  This is an organized criminal swarm that believes it will defeat us.
[3:28:36.360 --> 3:28:37.360]  It will not defeat us.
[3:28:37.360 --> 3:28:42.360]  The governor is the governor and he should not ever stand down.
[3:28:42.360 --> 3:28:47.360]  He needs to prove this, compare the databases from their state to the others and then remove
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:51.360]  the names that are improper and those votes and send the criminals to prison.
[3:28:51.360 --> 3:28:54.360]  We can all agree these are troubled times right?

[3:30:52.360 --> 3:30:55.360]  The Alex Jones Show.
[3:30:55.360 --> 3:31:00.360]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[3:31:00.360 --> 3:31:05.360]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine
[3:31:05.360 --> 3:31:10.360]  because the two billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[3:31:10.360 --> 3:31:11.360]  because they didn't get enough iodine.
[3:31:11.360 --> 3:31:15.360]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true,
[3:31:15.360 --> 3:31:20.360]  but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[3:31:20.360 --> 3:31:24.360]  And I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality,
[3:31:24.360 --> 3:31:30.360]  neuroceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[3:31:30.360 --> 3:31:35.360]  One of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids you're age
[3:31:35.360 --> 3:31:39.360]  and it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[3:31:39.360 --> 3:31:45.360]  They know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion are mentally retarded
[3:31:45.360 --> 3:31:48.360]  on the face of the Earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[3:31:48.360 --> 3:31:50.360]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[3:31:50.360 --> 3:31:53.360]  Infowars.com.
[3:31:53.360 --> 3:31:57.360]  Folks, ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[3:31:57.360 --> 3:32:03.360]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems
[3:32:03.360 --> 3:32:05.360]  and people will like different formulas.
[3:32:05.360 --> 3:32:07.360]  It's just that simple.
[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:11.360]  X3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types
[3:32:11.360 --> 3:32:17.360]  because some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine.
[3:32:17.360 --> 3:32:19.360]  Get both. They're both great for you.
[3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:24.360]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[3:32:24.360 --> 3:32:28.360]  Bottom line, iodine is essential. That's why I harp on it.
[3:32:28.360 --> 3:32:32.360]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[3:32:32.360 --> 3:32:35.360]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish. You don't live as long.
[3:32:35.360 --> 3:32:40.360]  It's simple. Get your high quality iodine at InfowarsTour.com and help fund the Infowar.

[3:32:42.360 --> 3:32:45.360]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[3:32:45.360 --> 3:32:47.360]  It's the iodine challenge.
[3:32:47.360 --> 3:32:54.360]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[3:33:17.360 --> 3:33:19.360]  Alex Jones.
[3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:50.360]  They're doing this. They're messing with these databases,
[3:33:50.360 --> 3:33:52.360]  and they're using the databases around the country
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:55.360]  because other states let illegals get driver's license
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:57.360]  and then let that get on the voter roll
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:01.360]  to find out states that don't to index them together and engage in the fraud.
[3:34:01.360 --> 3:34:04.360]  There's always been a concern from the beginning of motor voter legislation,
[3:34:04.360 --> 3:34:06.360]  which originally had some good intentions.
[3:34:06.360 --> 3:34:10.360]  It was to make it simpler and easier for more people to vote and participate in the electoral process.
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:15.360]  The problem or the risk is if they're not correctly making sure the lists are up to date
[3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:17.360]  and if they're not making sure...
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:19.360]  All of this could be easily solved by voter identification.
[3:34:19.360 --> 3:34:23.360]  95% of voter fraud concerns could be solved by requiring...
[3:34:23.360 --> 3:34:26.360]  Yeah, you've got to have an ID to match this.
[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:29.360]  Exactly, and that would deter a lot of bogus voting.
[3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:31.360]  Now, it wouldn't completely prevent it
[3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:36.360]  because local precincts could report certain people as voting who didn't show up to vote
[3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:38.360]  and then claim they voted a certain way.
[3:34:38.360 --> 3:34:43.360]  That's what happened when they did the examination in Detroit after 2016 in the recount
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:46.360]  where all of a sudden there was no further pursuit of it.
[3:34:46.360 --> 3:34:47.360]  They found...
[3:34:47.360 --> 3:34:49.360]  Now, of course, they're sort of lazy in this instance.
[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:51.360]  There were more ballots than people who voted.
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:53.360]  Yeah.
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:58.360]  Well, what should the current governor do when 175,000 people got put on two months ago
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:04.360]  and it turns out that Republicans in other states and immigrants that are legal but never voted?
[3:35:04.360 --> 3:35:07.360]  I mean, they ought to just index it, see who's in other states,
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:10.360]  see who is not a citizen, and boom, he wins.
[3:35:10.360 --> 3:35:13.360]  The other thing to do is always look for a turnout discrepancy.
[3:35:13.360 --> 3:35:19.360]  So people had been saying that after the more election in 2017 where Roy Moore lost the Alabama Senate seat,
[3:35:19.360 --> 3:35:20.360]  they thought there was voter fraud.
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:22.360]  I set out to prove that there was not voter fraud,
[3:35:22.360 --> 3:35:28.360]  but in the way to do so is to compare various turnout in demographically similar precincts
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:30.360]  compared to using presidential turnout as a baseline.
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:35.360]  Well, it turned out there were very unusual turnout trends in the 2017 Alabama race.
[3:35:35.360 --> 3:35:38.360]  You had the same demographic group two blocks apart.
[3:35:38.360 --> 3:35:41.360]  One of them turned out at 90% of presidential turnout.
[3:35:41.360 --> 3:35:44.360]  One of them would turn out at 65% of presidential turnout.
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:49.360]  And the way that can happen if the voter fraud is involved is people claim people voted who didn't,
[3:35:49.360 --> 3:35:52.360]  and they vote for them effectively and just stick it in the ballot box.
[3:35:52.360 --> 3:35:55.360]  And you have so much control at each individual precinct,
[3:35:55.360 --> 3:35:59.360]  particularly when you have precincts that are 90, 95%, 98% democratic.
[3:35:59.360 --> 3:36:03.360]  Oh, here in Austin, they have city council members electioneering at the door to the,
[3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:06.360]  it's a federal and state crime, but you still do.
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:08.360]  It has to be a certain amount of distance.
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:10.360]  And the reason for that is people, they don't want people feeling coercive pressure.
[3:36:10.360 --> 3:36:15.360]  You had the famous case in Philadelphia where people were armed and outside of the presence
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:18.360]  of various polling precincts that appeared to create intimidation.
[3:36:18.360 --> 3:36:19.360]  Black Panthers.
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:22.360]  The, that they called the new Black Panther Party was their self-identification.
[3:36:22.360 --> 3:36:26.360]  And there wasn't a meaningful real investigation into that one happened.
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:30.360]  So there's always risk when it comes to the ballot, to who's counting the ballot,
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:34.360]  how did the protocols happen to make sure that ballot was properly placed by a registered voter,
[3:36:34.360 --> 3:36:37.360]  how to make sure that particular person is who they claim to be.
[3:36:37.360 --> 3:36:38.360]  These are all the problems.
[3:36:38.360 --> 3:36:41.360]  And when you have an election that's so tight like Kentucky,
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:46.360]  you're talking about 5,000, 6,000 votes out of, out of hundreds of thousands of votes cast,
[3:36:46.360 --> 3:36:50.360]  then you can have realistic risk that voter fraud.
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:51.360]  But what about this case?
[3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:54.360]  I mean, this is stunning that a Republican who hadn't lived there in eight years
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:36:59.360]  was put on the rolls of Democrat and her husband, a legal immigrant, never voted is on it.
[3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:02.360]  I mean, that is just stunning, Millie.
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:08.360]  Yeah, she actually went through the process, like I said, of having herself removed in 2016.
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:11.360]  She sent in a notarized form and everything.
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:14.360]  And she was under the impression she was removed.
[3:37:14.360 --> 3:37:17.360]  And that's why they said it was when they did this litigation,
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:19.360]  they brought back all those purged voters.
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:22.360]  They put her back against her consent, essentially.
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:28.360]  And we should definitely look into this because Andy Bashir's office as attorney general,
[3:37:28.360 --> 3:37:31.360]  they participated in this lawsuit, this litigation.
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:34.360]  And yet he is now the one that won against Matt Blevin.
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:40.360]  He was the incumbent, the Democrat incumbent that won by a mere 5,000 votes.
[3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:45.360]  So we have to demand investigation immediately into the Kentucky election
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:49.360]  because if we're seeing it here, it means there's a lot more.
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:51.360]  It's like you see white cockroach.
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:52.360]  That means there's a lot more.
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:53.360]  Exactly.
[3:37:53.360 --> 3:37:54.360]  And you just said it.
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:55.360]  I mean, it's confirmed.
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:37:56.360]  I've got a big stack of articles.
[3:37:56.360 --> 3:38:03.360]  Dr. McHamshaw, please, where California 3.5 million more registered voters than live adults.
[3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:08.360]  You know, that's like investors.com study 1.8 million dead people still registered to vote.
[3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:09.360]  That's MP artist one area.
[3:38:09.360 --> 3:38:12.360]  The vote for all the Democrats refused to see New York Post.
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:16.360]  I've got dozens of these articles here and people do suits.
[3:38:16.360 --> 3:38:17.360]  They get the database.
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:23.360]  They check it and it's dead people or it's people that have moved out or it's illegals or it's immigrants.
[3:38:23.360 --> 3:38:24.360]  This is insane.
[3:38:24.360 --> 3:38:26.360]  People say the Democrats don't have crowds.
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:27.360]  They only have these blue cities.
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:29.360]  That's where they've got the election fraud in place.
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:32.360]  They never leave because it's fraud.
[3:38:32.360 --> 3:38:33.360]  No doubt.
[3:38:33.360 --> 3:38:39.360]  And there's such risk of fraud that it's amazing that the media is always so scared about a meaningful review.
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:43.360]  They weren't worried about it when the Georgia governor was claiming there was voter fraud.
[3:38:43.360 --> 3:38:46.360]  Then they were willing to let her continue to claim that the election was stolen from her.
[3:38:46.360 --> 3:38:50.360]  The Democratic candidate who lost the governor's race for years afterwards.
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:51.360]  With no evidence.
[3:38:51.360 --> 3:38:52.360]  Correct.
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:53.360]  Here's the deal.
[3:38:53.360 --> 3:38:54.360]  The Republican's cheating.
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:38:58.360]  Look, I saw some cheating on both sides back in 2000 between Gore and Bush.
[3:38:58.360 --> 3:38:59.360]  I don't know who won that.
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:04.360]  I mean, I know the Republican establishment will steal some stuff, but the Democrats are admitted.
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:11.360]  Well, I mean, I remember Obama on the eve of the election of his second election with Romney said vote often.
[3:39:11.360 --> 3:39:12.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:39:12.360 --> 3:39:17.360]  I actually bet on W in the 2000-2004 because I was trusting that he would make sure the
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:19.360]  votes got counted in a certain direction.
[3:39:19.360 --> 3:39:26.360]  I mean, there's a long history of voter manipulation and voter fraud taking place in all forms of government.
[3:39:26.360 --> 3:39:29.360]  That's not the reason they hate Roger Stone as he was involved in all that.
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:31.360]  Yeah, there's been, yeah, just that and the other about that.
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:34.360]  Well, he was definitely involved in everything that happened in Florida in 2000.
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:36.360]  And they've long believed.
[3:39:36.360 --> 3:39:37.360]  The Brooks Brother riot.
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:38.360]  Exactly.
[3:39:38.360 --> 3:39:41.360]  The Democrats and the media have been very selective when they highlight issues of voter fraud.
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:42.360]  It affects both parties.
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:44.360]  It affects both institutions.
[3:39:44.360 --> 3:39:45.360]  It's across the board.
[3:39:45.360 --> 3:39:47.360]  There should be full transparency about what happened.
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:48.360]  Precisely.
[3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:49.360]  They should be scared of it or afraid of it.
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:50.360]  They should welcome it.
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:53.360]  Mellie, when is your new, please, you're working super hard.
[3:39:53.360 --> 3:39:54.360]  I'm not cracking the whip here.
[3:39:54.360 --> 3:39:56.360]  When is your next big report coming out?
[3:39:56.360 --> 3:39:57.360]  What is it going to add to this?
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:39:59.360]  Because it's already the one you already put up is bombshell.
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:00.360]  Oh, yeah.
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:05.360]  We knew that this was imperative to get this information, the audio out to the public immediately.
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:10.360]  So we just dropped it pretty raw and we are going to be putting out another video and
[3:40:10.360 --> 3:40:15.360]  edited out report with more detail and kind of going in depth into the investigation that
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:16.360]  we did.
[3:40:16.360 --> 3:40:19.360]  But I'm also going to be doing a live stream on my channel, Millennial Mellie.
[3:40:19.360 --> 3:40:25.360]  And I'm going to be having the woman who recorded the audio on to talk about her whole situation.
[3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:26.360]  Okay.
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:27.360]  When is that?
[3:40:27.360 --> 3:40:29.360]  Because I would like to take that live tonight.
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:31.360]  We don't have a space now.
[3:40:31.360 --> 3:40:32.360]  We re-air my show six to seven.
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:34.360]  Maybe you did it then central.
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:38.360]  We would dial in and pick that up or just let us know and we'll take some of it live during
[3:40:38.360 --> 3:40:39.360]  the other shows.
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:40.360]  Yes.
[3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:41.360]  That's going to be this evening.
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:45.360]  I'm working with her on an exact time, but we're going to be sitting down and trying to
[3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:46.360]  do this as soon as we can.
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:47.360]  She's a very well spoken woman.
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:52.360]  All this information needs to... Oh yeah, she's extremely... I mean, this woman is very
[3:40:52.360 --> 3:40:53.360]  intelligent.
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:40:54.920]  She's on top of it.
[3:40:54.920 --> 3:40:59.360]  She's just the type of person that wants to have everything done right by the book and
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:00.360]  that's why she...
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:03.360]  And you've got the recordings of them checking the names and everything and the people on
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:04.360]  Wow.
[3:41:04.360 --> 3:41:06.960]  But I mean, again, you're going to find the things loaded with people.
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:10.360]  It's going to be loaded with people that aren't citizens and loaded with folks that moved
[3:41:10.360 --> 3:41:11.360]  away.
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:14.760]  Any time there's been any meaningful investigation or litigation, that's always been revealed
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:15.760]  for the most part.
[3:41:15.760 --> 3:41:16.760]  Pretty consistently.
[3:41:16.760 --> 3:41:17.760]  That's what Judicial Watch revealed.
[3:41:17.760 --> 3:41:21.760]  That's like an independent political scientist did a study back at, I believe, after the
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:23.320]  2012 election.
[3:41:23.320 --> 3:41:27.680]  And what he looked at was just looking at demographic data and other metrics.
[3:41:27.680 --> 3:41:31.880]  He could determine what percentage of illegal immigration likely participated in the electoral
[3:41:31.880 --> 3:41:32.880]  system.
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:36.400]  And he found the number to be very high and it shocked a lot of people in the millions.
[3:41:36.400 --> 3:41:39.360]  And he was just pointing out that... Well, Democrats now say they want the illegals
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:40.360]  voting.
[3:41:40.360 --> 3:41:42.360]  Well, yeah, there's been many Democrats that have said that unfortunately... Hell, they're
[3:41:42.360 --> 3:41:46.280]  passing laws in Chicago and in San Francisco where they do.
[3:41:46.280 --> 3:41:49.880]  Well, in the net effect of it, when... Oh, yes, they are, to allow them to officially
[3:41:49.880 --> 3:41:50.880]  participate.
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:53.840]  And the question becomes, once they're on their voter rolls and once they're participating
[3:41:53.840 --> 3:41:58.080]  in the election process for a local election, how are they going to preclude them from being
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:00.000]  participating in another election?
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  It's incredible.
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  Hell, I may become a legal alien.
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  You get more rights when you do.
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:05.040]  How do people follow you on Twitter?
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:06.520]  At Barnes Underscore Law.
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:09.360]  At Barnes Underscore Law and Millie.
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:11.080]  Millie Underscore Weaver on Twitter.
[3:42:11.080 --> 3:42:14.480]  All right, and give people your website.

[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:20.960]  as well or Millie Weaver on Facebook.
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:21.960]  All right.
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:22.960]  You're awesome.
[3:42:22.960 --> 3:42:24.840]  Gavin, your crew and everybody's awesome.
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:26.160]  And please pop on the other shows tonight.
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:29.400]  We'll be carrying a report as soon as it comes out.
[3:42:29.400 --> 3:42:31.000]  We'll post it to infowars.com folks.
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:33.240]  So first reports on infowars right now.
[3:42:33.240 --> 3:42:34.520]  Please get it out if you care.
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:37.280]  I mean, this is Cough and Nails the Globalist.
[3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:41.200]  I'm the current governor, Flood Fox News, Flood Tucker Carlson.
[3:42:41.200 --> 3:42:42.560]  I know I'm going to text it to him.
[3:42:42.560 --> 3:42:43.560]  Get it out.
[3:42:43.560 --> 3:42:44.560]  Thank you, Millie.
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:45.560]  Great job.
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:46.560]  I'm going to come back with that race report I talked about.
[3:42:46.560 --> 3:42:47.560]  Thanks, Bob.
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:55.800]  Please support us as well and spread the word about the transmission.
[3:42:55.800 --> 3:43:01.040]  And remember, your financial support is what makes this possible, plus we make it easy.
[3:43:01.040 --> 3:43:05.960]  We have really great products at infowars.com and we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:10.200]  year around this time, we are able to offer at their cost.
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:13.720]  And then we're given a rebate for the new year when we purchase these.
[3:43:13.720 --> 3:43:15.440]  This would have to pay taxes on them.
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:18.640]  This is $147 is the cost with free shipping.
[3:43:18.640 --> 3:43:19.840]  They've never done a deal that good.
[3:43:19.840 --> 3:43:20.840]  It's a hot item.
[3:43:20.840 --> 3:43:22.840]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:25.480]  It's a four-stage ion cluster.
[3:43:25.480 --> 3:43:28.760]  Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[3:43:28.760 --> 3:43:29.760]  All the markup.
[3:43:29.760 --> 3:43:33.200]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $250.
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:35.200]  They're a great deal.
[3:43:35.200 --> 3:43:37.440]  I'm gonna proceed to the 2012-2017.
[3:43:37.440 --> 3:43:40.240]  I almost told the guy, this cuts into the market, selling just slow.
[3:43:40.240 --> 3:43:41.440]  People don't appreciate it.
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:43.560]  Well, this is what the infowars audience gets.
[3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:47.680]  infowars.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at this price, and then more
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:52.720]  to come in until next year.
[3:43:52.720 --> 3:43:59.920]  The witch queen of the deep state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant, and
[3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:01.720]  A corporate whores in the media,
[3:44:01.720 --> 3:44:05.600]  busily covering up her giant pedophile in black mill rings,
[3:44:05.600 --> 3:44:08.400]  thought that her victory was assured.
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:11.000]  Now that the enemy lost that election,
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:15.040]  they are awake and throwing everything they've got at us.
[3:44:15.040 --> 3:44:16.600]  And conservatives and nationalists,
[3:44:16.600 --> 3:44:18.320]  Christians and patriots, many of them,
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:20.600]  are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[3:44:20.600 --> 3:44:23.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[3:44:23.200 --> 3:44:25.400]  We just lost the Virginia State House
[3:44:25.400 --> 3:44:27.040]  the first time in 30 years.
[3:44:27.040 --> 3:44:28.240]  This is serious.
[3:44:28.240 --> 3:44:31.760]  We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten,
[3:44:31.760 --> 3:44:34.280]  or we can see it all washed down the drain.
[3:44:34.280 --> 3:44:36.680]  Whatever you do, get more politically activated
[3:44:36.680 --> 3:44:38.880]  than you ever have, and spread the live links
[3:44:38.880 --> 3:44:42.000]  at band.video and infowars.com for its last show.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:44.280]  If you want to defeat the state and the globalist,
[3:44:44.280 --> 3:44:45.840]  then get fired up.
[3:44:45.840 --> 3:45:03.280]  And luckily, our break room at the infowars headquarters
[3:45:03.280 --> 3:45:06.640]  is stocked full of high quality infowars store,
[3:45:06.640 --> 3:45:08.900]  Patriot blend coffee.
[3:45:08.900 --> 3:45:11.600]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[3:45:11.600 --> 3:45:17.000]  the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:20.600]  at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[3:45:20.600 --> 3:45:25.760]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[3:45:25.760 --> 3:45:27.640]  There has never been a more important time
[3:45:27.640 --> 3:45:29.800]  to support infowars.
[3:45:29.800 --> 3:45:31.920]  So if you love coffee, and if you
[3:45:31.920 --> 3:45:36.640]  want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[3:45:36.640 --> 3:45:39.560]  Order now at the infowars store.

[3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:50.280]  at infowarsstore.com.
[3:45:53.080 --> 3:45:57.240]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[3:45:57.240 --> 3:46:00.720]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[3:46:00.720 --> 3:46:04.320]  They're waging war on communication itself.
[3:46:04.320 --> 3:46:05.960]  As the Fabian socialists promised,
[3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:08.760]  they would do more than 70 years ago from their command
[3:46:08.760 --> 3:46:11.040]  base in England.
[3:46:11.040 --> 3:46:13.960]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:16.920]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you,
[3:46:16.920 --> 3:46:18.680]  kick you out of college, destroy you,
[3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:20.360]  have you arrested in some areas.
[3:46:20.360 --> 3:46:23.800]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign
[3:46:23.800 --> 3:46:27.480]  language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[3:46:27.480 --> 3:46:30.680]  These people are authoritarians, and they're dangerous.
[3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:32.640]  And the answer to their attack on speech
[3:46:32.640 --> 3:46:34.920]  is to exercise it in their face.
[3:46:34.920 --> 3:46:38.720]  We have a it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap,
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:41.560]  it's black and white, very nice as the OK symbol on it.
[3:46:41.560 --> 3:46:43.440]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[3:46:43.440 --> 3:46:45.400]  infowars.com is on the back.
[3:46:45.400 --> 3:46:47.880]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com
[3:46:47.880 --> 3:46:50.240]  and support free speech by supporting infowars
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:51.560]  while having a great hat.
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:47:06.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:21.560 --> 3:47:37.360]  So, ladies and gentlemen, there are countless videos every day
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:40.920]  of white people being beaten up and being attacked and being
[3:47:40.920 --> 3:47:43.000]  stabbed and being robbed and being knocked out
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:44.400]  and being pushed on railroad tracks.
[3:47:44.400 --> 3:47:46.320]  And Islamists is doing it to them.
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:48.000]  And the media just says white people are bad,
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:49.760]  they deserve to die.
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:51.960]  And there's all these other articles just completely
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:56.480]  and totally celebrating it all over the world.
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:47:59.560]  And articles about how whites need to be gotten rid of
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:03.200]  and 125,000 retweets of a woman saying,
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:05.720]  oh, I just robbed this white woman's purse.
[3:48:05.720 --> 3:48:07.680]  She deserved it.
[3:48:07.680 --> 3:48:08.920]  There it is.
[3:48:08.920 --> 3:48:10.840]  Woman brags about stealing purse of money
[3:48:10.840 --> 3:48:14.520]  from homophobic white woman gets 126,000 likes on Twitter.
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:18.960]  That's the type of stuff we're talking about.
[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:22.400]  And then we've got this new video of a white teenager
[3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:24.080]  being robbed by black folks at gunpoint
[3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:26.400]  while they say racial epitaphs at them.
[3:48:26.400 --> 3:48:28.520]  And again, imagine if a white person did that,
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:32.040]  it'd be all over the news, it'd be nationwide race riots.
[3:48:32.040 --> 3:48:38.400]  But the media knows how to hype up just the certain things
[3:48:38.400 --> 3:48:39.520]  to get what they want.
[3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:42.240]  And that's in the Wiki Leaks, the Democrats are up to that.
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:44.400]  So here's some of the video.
[3:48:44.400 --> 3:48:48.780]  This is my phone, man.
[3:48:48.780 --> 3:48:49.220]  Where do you want it?
[3:48:49.220 --> 3:48:50.640]  What do you want?
[3:48:50.640 --> 3:48:55.160]  Hold it, everything, bro.
[3:48:55.160 --> 3:48:56.120]  Got that in the other?
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:00.440]  Hey, który shots the hair?
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:02.460]  Who the fuck do you think you is?
[3:49:02.460 --> 3:49:03.900]  Get this nigga phone, bro.
[3:49:03.900 --> 3:49:05.900]  Go, bro, please.
[3:49:05.900 --> 3:49:08.480]  I'm not playing with you.
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:09.820]  Give him your phone, bro.
[3:49:09.820 --> 3:49:10.640]  Sign here.
[3:49:10.640 --> 3:49:21.080]  Bro don't touch him bro. What do you want? I'll give you some. What do you want? What do you want? What you got?
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:26.680]  Hey, what you got? Now you got money? What you got? Now you got money? What's he got?
[3:49:26.680 --> 3:49:27.680]  What you got?
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:31.840]  30. Why is he thinking for his airpods bro?
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:32.340]  No.
[3:49:32.340 --> 3:49:34.760]  Ran out for his shoes bro. What are you actually shoes at?
[3:49:34.760 --> 3:49:35.260]  Hey.
[3:49:35.260 --> 3:49:37.640]  Ran his shoes bro. Ran all his ribs bro.
[3:49:37.640 --> 3:49:42.240]  Getting ass out here bro. Getting ass out here bro. Don't play with us bro.
[3:49:42.240 --> 3:49:44.640]  Fucking play with the gang bro.
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:56.640]  So, hunting white people is a big sport. And white people are so self-hating and so domesticated that that's just the way it is.
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:01.640]  You'll never see that on the national news though. It's just every day. It's just constant.
[3:50:01.640 --> 3:50:07.640]  But here's another example. Here's Pierce Morgan who doesn't believe we need guns to defend ourselves.
[3:50:07.640 --> 3:50:12.640]  He's got private bodyguards talking about UK Village known as Little White Town for over 500 years.
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:16.640]  It's had that name because of the shore. It's a port. It's got white rocks.
[3:50:16.640 --> 3:50:28.640]  Maybe forced to change its name over racism complaints. Because back in the old days they would name ports off of yellow cliffs or white rock or, you know, round rock or black rock.
[3:50:28.640 --> 3:50:32.640]  Or free port meant they didn't make you pay to pull into it.
[3:50:32.640 --> 3:50:37.640]  Sure nobody knows the names of ports. Well, oh, the word white is upsetting.
[3:50:37.640 --> 3:50:46.640]  Like white house or white rock lake is in Dallas because they have white rocks on the shore.
[3:50:46.640 --> 3:50:50.640]  It's the white rock lake, you know. That's how they have towns.
[3:50:50.640 --> 3:51:02.640]  Or like Brown Mountain or Greenfield. Well, people want that taken down. They want it gotten rid of.
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:08.640]  So that's what's unfolding, ladies and gentlemen. So let's go ahead and play Pierce Morgan. Here it is.
[3:51:08.640 --> 3:51:16.640]  You look, Mr. McGoff, I live in Biddiffin. I'm very concerned that I think everybody should be shot dead in the town.
[3:51:16.640 --> 3:51:20.640]  That's not a very nice comparison. Something extreme like, well, everyone's shot dead.
[3:51:20.640 --> 3:51:25.640]  Would you then propose a motion that you don't agree with saying I propose that everyone should be shot dead in this town?
[3:51:25.640 --> 3:51:30.640]  Well, I'm pretty set on air, so I'm not going to give any views. I'd say that to you.
[3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:34.640]  No, I think, Mr. McGoff, I'd give you quite a passionate view because I'm passionate about my town.
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:45.640]  You've just said the only reason you proposed a motion you completely disagree with is because some people complained and it was a parishioners had an idea they wanted to get rid of the signs.
[3:51:45.640 --> 3:51:53.640]  So I'm taking it to a logical extension and saying, if some parishioner came to you with some other mad idea, would you then propose a motion saying that that shouldn't happen?
[3:51:53.640 --> 3:51:54.640]  No, you wouldn't, would you?
[3:51:54.640 --> 3:51:59.640]  If I feel passionate about a town and trying to defend your town, at the end of the day, it's taking two months, but it's a motion to a table.
[3:51:59.640 --> 3:52:00.640]  How does that happen?
[3:52:00.640 --> 3:52:05.640]  I can't listen to this anymore. There are things called Lynch Hall in this country, an Irish name.
[3:52:05.640 --> 3:52:12.640]  People think it means Lynch Black people because there was a famous case of a Lynch guy who was, by the way, wasn't Black being lynched.
[3:52:12.640 --> 3:52:20.640]  It's mental illness, but the system empowers it because they want the media to hype things they want to cause a giant domino effect.
[3:52:20.640 --> 3:52:28.640]  So they're saying the OK symbol is racist and the left is banning it and prosecuting people in Europe to try to use it.
[3:52:28.640 --> 3:52:36.640]  Well, PewDiePie points out that now the brofist, which when somebody sends you a fist straight on, it means I want to bump fists with you.
[3:52:36.640 --> 3:52:40.640]  Now, you say, oh, the left's crazy saying that's white supremacist and wanting to get rid of it.
[3:52:40.640 --> 3:52:46.640]  No, they're not crazy. They want dominance over everything in the world.
[3:52:46.640 --> 3:52:53.640]  That's what they're doing. That's what they're establishing. They know damn well their operation.
[3:52:53.640 --> 3:53:02.640]  And you glorify groveling. Oh, men and women's bathrooms upset you because some people identify as a dog.
[3:53:02.640 --> 3:53:07.640]  Let's give in to that. Oh, big fat men want to dress up in clown makeup and come hang out with your kids.
[3:53:07.640 --> 3:53:14.640]  So Sweden just put hundreds of thousands of dollars to start it there to pay men to go and fondle children.
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:20.640]  It's about training you to be a slave. Here's PewDiePie breaking it down.
[3:53:20.640 --> 3:53:25.640]  Quick question. Which one of these is a hate symbol?
[3:53:25.640 --> 3:53:36.640]  Is it A, the bull haircut, B, the number 12, or C, the OK hand sign?
[3:53:36.640 --> 3:53:40.640]  All of them.
[3:53:40.640 --> 3:53:48.640]  The answer is, of course, all of them. Let's go through some more examples.
[3:53:48.640 --> 3:53:54.640]  Hey, remember this guy? I've actually never showed him properly on my channel.
[3:53:54.640 --> 3:53:57.640]  But most of you probably know it's Pepe the Frog.
[3:53:57.640 --> 3:54:02.640]  Pepe the Frog was a booming name from 2015 to 2016. Everyone loved this guy.
[3:54:02.640 --> 3:54:08.640]  From what started in just a pretty small comic book was adopted by the Internet to become the biggest meme of that time.
[3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:13.640]  Celebrities were posting him and what made Pepe so popular was that he could be made into anything.
[3:54:13.640 --> 3:54:17.640]  And the fact that there were so many different versions of Pepe became a meme in itself.
[3:54:17.640 --> 3:54:26.640]  Pepe practically became too popular and versions of Pepe that should never have been made was created, which changed things a lot.
[3:54:26.640 --> 3:54:32.640]  But they were all of them deceived for another reason is made.
[3:54:32.640 --> 3:54:37.640]  Pepe was made.
[3:54:52.640 --> 3:54:57.640]  Burging racist ideology known as the alt-right.
[3:54:57.640 --> 3:55:03.640]  Junior, for example, he put this image on his Instagram account. It's a meme of Pepe.
[3:55:03.640 --> 3:55:07.640]  And for those of you who don't know, Pepe is a white national symbol.
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:13.640]  They are essentially nihilists who do it for the law. Basically, that means for the heck of it.
[3:55:13.640 --> 3:55:18.640]  Racist, anti-Semitic and overall just offensive Pepe memes were spread across the Internet.
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:22.640]  And the future of Pepe looked bleak.
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:26.640]  But there were some who resisted.
[3:55:26.640 --> 3:55:28.640]  Some people fought back.
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:35.640]  A movement called hashtag save Pepe was created by Matt Fury, Pepe's creator, to try and bring Pepe back to something positive.
[3:55:35.640 --> 3:55:39.640]  The Internet tried to help. Even ADL tried to help.
[3:55:39.640 --> 3:55:42.640]  But it was too late.
[3:55:42.640 --> 3:55:45.640]  Alright, we'll air the whole thing coming up on the war.
[3:55:45.640 --> 3:55:47.640]  It's important. No, the ADL didn't try to help.
[3:55:47.640 --> 3:55:54.640]  Matt Fury, who said it was free and said the whole world should use it and who put it out there,
[3:55:54.640 --> 3:56:02.640]  figured out, oh, I can call it white supremacist and then take my copy right back by claiming everyone's white supremacist that have it.
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:06.640]  And then he sued me. But he didn't get the money he was looking for.
[3:56:06.640 --> 3:56:09.640]  The Democrat firms spent a million and a half dollars.
[3:56:09.640 --> 3:56:12.640]  They got $15,000 from us to what the judge said.
[3:56:12.640 --> 3:56:15.640]  You've won this case, but I'm not going to let it go to trial.
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:18.640]  Pay them $15,000.
[3:56:18.640 --> 3:56:24.640]  Incredible.
[3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:26.640]  Again, that's another one of the symbols they've taken away.
[3:56:26.640 --> 3:56:28.640]  Meanwhile, we'll go out to break.
[3:56:28.640 --> 3:56:32.640]  We'll go out to the end of the show here with Popeyes chaos is up on drugreport.com.
[3:56:32.640 --> 3:56:36.640]  Angry Americans fight over coveted chicken sandwich.
[3:56:36.640 --> 3:56:39.640]  And this is the hysteria where they say it's also coveted.
[3:56:39.640 --> 3:56:40.640]  Oh, you've got to have it.
[3:56:40.640 --> 3:56:43.640]  And it's just a chicken sandwich and people actually buy into it.
[3:56:43.640 --> 3:56:45.640]  Here it is. Just like they buy into Trump's evil in a racist.
[3:56:45.640 --> 3:56:48.640]  It's all just total high. Here it is.
[3:56:48.640 --> 3:56:52.640]  Holy shit!
[3:56:52.640 --> 3:56:56.640]  People stabbing each other to death over chicken sandwiches.
[3:56:56.640 --> 3:57:00.640]  Because the media, an Austin PR firm,
[3:57:00.640 --> 3:57:03.640]  says it is the ultimate thing in the universe.
[3:57:03.640 --> 3:57:06.640]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[3:57:06.640 --> 3:57:08.640]  Yes.
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:09.640]  Yeah, what the hell?
[3:57:09.640 --> 3:57:11.640]  Oh.
[3:57:11.640 --> 3:57:12.640]  Oh my God.
[3:57:12.640 --> 3:57:17.960]  They won't fight for freedom. The average American won't get involved. But boy, if it's over a hype and a sandwich
[3:57:18.720 --> 3:57:20.720]  Let's kill each other
[3:57:21.240 --> 3:57:26.960]  Or I'm a no destroyer at Band-Aid video and in full wars.com force my show on our radio TV affiliates coming up
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:32.920]  He's ready. He's locked and loaded. Thank you all for your support. Remember. They're all over the news calling for my arrest right now for no reason
