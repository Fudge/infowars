[00:00.000 --> 00:08.240]  College campuses across the country are being invaded by cowardly communist scum known as
[00:08.240 --> 00:15.360]  Antifa. In the microcosm of Austin, Texas, the University of Texas at Austin in particular,
[00:15.360 --> 00:22.920]  this growing threat is about to reach a breaking point. It is a subversive criminal organization
[00:22.920 --> 00:28.080]  using the University of Texas as a recruiting center, namely the Red Guards of Austin and
[00:28.080 --> 00:33.200]  the Revolutionary Student Front, and is the University of Texas aware of these developments.
[00:33.200 --> 00:44.480]  If our office, as the office responsible for student conduct, if we are able to identify an
[00:44.480 --> 00:51.080]  individual student or student who we are able to find responsible based on evidence, there would
[00:51.080 --> 00:57.600]  be administrative sanctions at the university level as well, separate from criminal responsibility.
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.960]  UT fraternities have been targeted with vandalism by the Red Guards of Austin. The Red Guards
[01:02.960 --> 01:09.120]  Facebook page claims that UT fraternities promote rape culture, a group simply labeling
[01:09.120 --> 01:15.720]  themselves as the vandals of UT Austin posted this quote, let us make racist frat brothers and the
[01:15.720 --> 01:21.640]  administration afraid again, afraid of students, afraid of the marginalized and harassed, afraid
[01:21.640 --> 01:28.600]  of the exploited and excluded. Some individuals claiming to be rogue actors and not connected
[01:28.600 --> 01:36.760]  with other organizations anonymously claimed responsibility for some of the vandalism on
[01:36.760 --> 01:42.040]  the private residences west of our campus. And that is certainly very frustrating. The
[01:42.040 --> 01:49.920]  Revolutionary Student Front is not a student organization. Our university does not have
[01:49.920 --> 01:57.360]  any rules against political or personal beliefs. Our institutional rules are in support of our
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.640]  educational mission. That is why our students are here is to learn and to grow. But our rules
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.760]  are also there about how our students treat each other and how they treat this campus and that
[02:08.760 --> 02:14.800]  those educational goals. And that's really what our mission is. The Revolutionary Student Front
[02:14.800 --> 02:20.960]  has even targeted the president of the University of Texas, Greg Fenves, stating your marginalized
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.400]  students don't feel welcome or safe here, Greg, and your white supremacist do. So don't be surprised
[02:26.400 --> 02:31.280]  when we boil over and start to take this into our own hands. And now these communist groups are
[02:31.280 --> 02:37.600]  bringing their message to the Austin public at large. On February 11, 2017, Antifa Red Guards
[02:37.600 --> 02:43.680]  Austin member Lisa Hogan was arrested for aggravated assault when she threw rocks at the patrons of
[02:43.680 --> 02:49.600]  East Side Tavern while marching in favor of the anti-gentrification movement in East Austin.
[02:49.600 --> 02:55.520]  Antifa members are now bringing loaded guns to protest rallies after publicly intending to use
[02:55.520 --> 03:01.440]  them. From their Facebook page, quote, there is nothing less desirable to and more hated by the
[03:01.440 --> 03:07.280]  state and powers that be than a Maoist Communist Party because unlike other so-called parties,
[03:07.280 --> 03:14.560]  it exists for one reason, the violent overthrow of the existing order. This means armed struggle,
[03:14.560 --> 03:19.600]  the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the continuation of revolution
[03:19.600 --> 03:24.960]  in the period of socialism. Recently, it became public knowledge that the George Soros-funded
[03:24.960 --> 03:30.560]  Antifa group is selling concealed knives on their website intended for, quote,
[03:30.560 --> 03:36.320]  slicing conservatives. But Antifa has a big problem. We don't want them here and they don't
[03:36.320 --> 03:42.960]  belong. 18 U.S. Code 2385, a U.S. Code against advocating the overthrow of the government states,
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.080]  whoever knowingly or willfully advocates a bet, advises or teaches the duty, necessity,
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.280]  desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States,
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.960]  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years or both. And of course,
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.920]  there's a long-standing 63-year act signed into law by President Eisenhower titled
[04:03.920 --> 04:10.560]  The Communist Control Act of 1954 that stated, the Communist Party was described as an instrumentality
[04:10.560 --> 04:15.920]  of a conspiracy to overthrow the government and a clear, present, and continuing danger to the
[04:15.920 --> 04:20.880]  security of the United States. The act made membership to the Communist Party a criminal
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.880]  act and stipulated that all party members would be sanctioned with up to a $10,000 fine or imprisonment
[04:26.880 --> 04:32.480]  for five years or both. Despite that, no administration or law enforcement has tried to
[04:32.480 --> 04:39.200]  enforce it. Law enforcement, Obama's socialist, communist, Islamic meanderings no longer hold
[04:39.200 --> 04:46.000]  a hypnotic sway over these United States of America. It's simple. Calling out for the overthrow of
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.920]  the United States government is not protected by free speech. In fact, it is illegal according to
[04:51.920 --> 05:03.600]  18 code 2385. So what are you waiting for? John Bounds, rifflewars.com. Police departments across
[05:03.600 --> 05:11.120]  the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called Stingrays, which use cell phone towers
[05:11.120 --> 05:18.720]  to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants. The technology comes courtesy of the
[05:18.720 --> 05:24.800]  FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing nondisclosure agreements,
[05:24.800 --> 05:30.480]  forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology. Needless to say, this is a direct
[05:30.480 --> 05:36.560]  violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless Stingray spying,
[05:36.560 --> 05:42.160]  where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people
[05:42.160 --> 05:48.160]  who are not even suspected of any crimes. Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't
[05:48.160 --> 05:56.240]  coming, it's already here. This is Darren McBreen, and I invite you to join the resistance, infowars.com.

[06:33.280 --> 06:37.920]  bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our

[08:13.280 --> 08:17.760]  happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[08:19.920 --> 08:25.760]  From the front lines of the information war is Alex Jones.
[08:25.760 --> 08:46.560]  If you got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made that happen.
[08:48.320 --> 08:50.240]  The internet didn't get invented on its own.
[08:50.240 --> 08:59.520]  On this Friday global edition of the Alex Jones show, David Knight is going to be hosting. I'll
[08:59.520 --> 09:04.480]  be popping in live as well. We've got a lot of special guests today. And also we're going to have
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.760]  excerpts from the 30 plus hour global transmission in defense of free speech and the defense of the
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.840]  West that started Wednesday and ran through yesterday evening. I want to commend the crew for
[09:13.840 --> 09:17.760]  the great job they've done. I want to thank God, of course, for all the blessings and support in
[09:17.760 --> 09:22.720]  the face of the enemy and his provision and his guidance and direction without which we would
[09:22.720 --> 09:27.680]  have nothing. And of course, I want to thank the amazing audience and supporters and our affiliates
[09:27.680 --> 09:33.120]  out there and sponsors without you. We could not be changing the world together. Trump has had a
[09:33.120 --> 09:39.440]  spectacular victory with the repeal and overhaul of Obamacare, but an even bigger victor is the
[09:39.440 --> 09:45.520]  American people and the freedom caucus that forced the first version of the bill that Paul Ryan and
[09:45.520 --> 09:51.760]  the Republican blue blood scum tried to sneak through. That monstrosity was only maybe 30-40%
[09:51.760 --> 09:56.640]  better than Obamacare, the Z-Kill Emanuel or the main architects, as well as Jonathan Gruber,
[09:56.640 --> 10:02.960]  another architect admitted was designed to bankrupt our healthcare system and bring in a single payer,
[10:02.960 --> 10:09.920]  fascist system, not socialist, that's bad enough, administered by the mega banks, forcing us to buy
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.840]  a product and raising the price as high as they wanted it to. So this new legislation I looked
[10:13.840 --> 10:19.120]  over yesterday and this morning has some major problems and hopefully those get cut out. The
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.080]  Senate, Senator Rand Paul has said, but regardless this is a big victory and it puts it into the
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.160]  Senate's hands and the Republicans there, Rand Paul, and of course Senator Cruz and others who
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.640]  have really good voting records, hopefully can make it even better. The problem is the Democrats
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.840]  want to make it worse. So the fight is intensifying. This is a huge victory. I took them two plus years
[10:39.840 --> 10:46.880]  to pass Obamacare. It's taken Trump 100 in what, six, seven days? That's about 106 days to get it
[10:46.880 --> 10:51.600]  out of the House and now it's up to the Senate. He has delivered and the Republicans have the
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.240]  House, the Senate, the legislative, the executive, they have the Trump Factor. So Trump's done some
[10:56.240 --> 11:00.880]  sideways stuff but overall we've got a good Supreme Court Justice in. The word is Kennedy
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.160]  stepping down as imminent. So a lot of good things happening because we fought back and took action.
[11:06.160 --> 11:11.920]  Do we expect instant gratification? No. Do we expect a bet of roses? No. But really, really
[11:11.920 --> 11:18.880]  exciting, powerful things are happening, things to you out there taking action, promoting Americana,
[11:18.880 --> 11:24.320]  promoting free market capitalism and open free society compared to Venezuela or Cuba or
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.280]  Soviet Russia or communist China or North Korea or these other authoritarian regimes. It's night
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.640]  and day. Our job is easy. We just don't want to intimidate us and shout out, stop and take action.
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.520]  But this is a big victory for the true constitutional, libertarian, proto-conservative
[11:39.520 --> 11:44.800]  Tea Party. This is a big, big deal we've taken over the Republican Party so far. There's a civil
[11:44.800 --> 11:49.840]  war inside the bureaucracy trying to stop this but we are crushing the Fourth of State, the mainstream
[11:49.840 --> 11:54.640]  media, they know it, they see it in full wars as the tip of the spear because we are, because you
[11:54.640 --> 12:00.560]  are and they're trying to get to us and demonize us and shut us up as an example to others to
[12:00.560 --> 12:06.080]  cower in fear. We're Americans. I'm a Texan. I'm not backing down. My ancestors didn't back down
[12:06.080 --> 12:11.920]  and why should I back down? When our victory is absolutely secured into the future, we are
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.520]  winning. InfoWars.com, spread that link together. Me absolutely hates it. In closing, I know Dave
[12:17.520 --> 12:21.520]  was going to play this clip coming up. Obama has come out, of course, a few years ago and said,
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.800]  if you have a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else did it. Total insane arrogance.
[12:26.800 --> 12:30.960]  If you have North Korea, you didn't build that. Some dictator did. No, America was built on just
[12:30.960 --> 12:35.440]  a little bit of free market and everybody wanted to come here. Imagine if we actually realized
[12:35.440 --> 12:39.200]  more of that, how great it would be. All the choices, all the innovations, all the freedoms will
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.160]  now, Obama has come out, the articles on infowars.com and said that he's scared, that he's frightened,
[12:44.160 --> 12:49.680]  that he's concerned, seeing a business he built over eight years being demolished, being torn down.
[12:50.480 --> 12:55.120]  Obama, you were tearing America down under globalism and selling off our industry and our ideas
[12:55.120 --> 12:59.360]  to special interests that you and others were profiting from in your global system.
[12:59.360 --> 13:03.360]  So to have you say, if you have a business, you didn't build it. Somebody else did.
[13:03.360 --> 13:08.160]  Now you're saying you built the last eight years when you were the one tearing things down. Now
[13:08.160 --> 13:12.240]  you accuse Trump of tearing things down. What all he's doing is tearing the face-sucking,
[13:12.240 --> 13:17.360]  globalist, parasitic system off the face of the American people and an example to other nation
[13:17.360 --> 13:22.720]  states about how to get out from under this fourth, fifth branch of government that's globalism,
[13:22.720 --> 13:28.080]  this crowning capitalist system that sits up on top of us like some perching vulture,
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.200]  parasite feeding on us. Just the incredible arrogance, the incredible overthrow of reality,
[13:33.200 --> 13:37.520]  the incredible in-your-face inversion of reality to then say that Trump is tearing
[13:37.520 --> 13:43.840]  down his beautiful work when his work was tearing us down. So this is a day long-remembered,
[13:43.840 --> 13:49.040]  May 5th, 2017 on the single to mile where we show a great single to mile. I always enjoy
[13:49.040 --> 13:53.120]  single to mile, great, great fun. And I just want everybody to understand that they're attacking
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.160]  true multiculturalism, all of us enjoying each other's cultures, saying it's cultural appropriation
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.320]  and trying to make us not have any melting pot culture, but to have a corporate culture
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.960]  of cult-like control of tackling free speech where Bill Nye, the science guy now bans saying
[14:06.960 --> 14:11.760]  the chromosomes make men and women. I mean, science is under attack. Science is real.
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.000]  These people claim science isn't real. You know, claiming that man-made global warming is going
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.120]  to kill us all with science shows. It's not that. They want man-made global carbon taxes to totally
[14:21.120 --> 14:26.880]  control all of us and in the darkness, rule us of the new dark aides are setting up. But again,
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.240]  back to David Knight and the amazing videos and articles we have coming up. A teacher in New Orleans
[14:32.240 --> 14:36.960]  and she wants to be dead. And the same with a guy who's upset about it is an animal. I want to get
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.240]  this guy on the show. He's been a guest before. He's amazing. Mr. Dabari, but I'm totally fired up
[14:42.240 --> 14:46.320]  right now. I'll be typing in live later. Again, if you're watching or listening to this transmission,
[14:46.320 --> 14:49.920]  they're counting on you laying down. They're counting on breaking your spirit because they
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.720]  know you are the spirit of resistance. So don't give in because you are the resistance. I salute
[14:54.720 --> 15:00.080]  you all and thank you all for your support. Amazing job. All right. And that was Alex Jones.
[15:00.080 --> 15:03.680]  I'm David Knight and we've got a lot of news today. We've got a lot of information about
[15:03.680 --> 15:07.840]  Obamacare that we're going to be talking about as Alex pointed out. We have Michael Dabari,
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.840]  a guy who, if you've been to New Orleans and the French Quarter, you've seen him there. He's got
[15:11.840 --> 15:17.040]  a booth set up there where he broadcasts our show. Very interesting encounters that he gets,
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.640]  and you'll see that on his YouTube channel. Of course, he had one teacher wants to kill Alex
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.680]  because he basically brainwashed her son. Her son agreed with us, but she didn't have anything to
[15:27.680 --> 15:32.800]  say. She just wanted to censor us, which is what we always see. Maybe if she had talked to her son,
[15:33.680 --> 15:38.480]  maybe there would be a discussion there. Maybe she would understand his position. Maybe she
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.400]  might have learned something or maybe she could have convinced him. Who knows? But that's not what
[15:42.400 --> 15:47.600]  the left wants to do. They just want to censor people. But I want to focus at this point on
[15:47.600 --> 15:53.120]  what Alex referenced earlier. This is the article on infowars.com by Steve Watson.
[15:53.120 --> 15:58.800]  Obama says the Trump presidency is like watching a business he had built for eight years being
[15:58.800 --> 16:07.200]  slowly ripped down. You know, Obama, many Americans understand exactly what that feels like because
[16:07.200 --> 16:14.480]  many people in America watched their businesses being slowly ripped down by you over those eight
[16:14.480 --> 16:20.000]  years. You really didn't build anything, okay? What you were doing was you're building a socialist
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.680]  wall, just like George Washington said. We walk about freely, but between high walls. You made
[16:25.680 --> 16:31.200]  the walls much higher. You made them much narrower with your socialism. You know, your big monument
[16:31.200 --> 16:37.200]  to yourself was Obamacare. You're seeing this coming down. Of course, it was terminally ill.
[16:37.200 --> 16:41.200]  It was going to die, and now the Republicans are just kind of hurrying this along, removing
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.000]  the life support. We really need to pull the plug on it and remove the life support that you're
[16:46.880 --> 16:52.240]  stealing from investors, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors. That's Jerome,
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.360]  of course, he's been pointing out for several months now. This whole subsidy scam that you've
[16:57.360 --> 17:02.480]  got going here, and really we ought to call it Venezuelan care because that's truly what it is.
[17:03.280 --> 17:09.920]  Just as Hugo Chavez and Maduro like to fund their failing government, their failing society
[17:09.920 --> 17:16.720]  by theft, by stealing automobile factories, by stealing oil companies, oil drilling companies,
[17:16.720 --> 17:20.320]  et cetera. They think they can keep this socialism going, but as Margaret Thatcher said,
[17:20.320 --> 17:24.640]  eventually you run out of other people's money. Well, you haven't run out of Fannie and Freddie
[17:24.640 --> 17:29.840]  investors. You've been robbing Fannie and Freddie to feed Hillary and Barry, and that's going to
[17:29.840 --> 17:36.160]  play out. That's what you built. You built it on borrowed money. You didn't pay for it.
[17:37.440 --> 17:42.800]  And we're going to take a look at this half a billion dollar presidential center that he's
[17:42.800 --> 17:48.480]  building to himself as Zero Hedge says, it's like something that would make the pharaohs jealous.
[17:50.560 --> 17:54.240]  Truly is amazing. We'll show some pictures of that on that article here, but let's see
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.560]  what he says. I said it's an article from Politico, cites Obama insiders describing how
[17:58.560 --> 18:03.040]  the former president feels about watching Donald Trump conduct affairs from the White House,
[18:03.040 --> 18:08.240]  and it will make satisfying readers for Trump supporters. Okay, because a little bit of
[18:08.240 --> 18:12.320]  shade and Freud here. The article says that Obama has displayed a range of emotions with
[18:12.320 --> 18:18.560]  regard to Trump, including stoicism, fear, and sad frustration. And of course, it's like washing
[18:18.560 --> 18:25.440]  his business. It's not a business. Okay, this is nothing but socialist theft that you have created
[18:25.440 --> 18:31.360]  here. And what he did was a monument to really the way America is. It is a mixture. Obamacare,
[18:31.360 --> 18:36.720]  like our current government, is a mixture of socialism where you steal from one group of people
[18:36.720 --> 18:43.120]  and then hand it off to other people. And also chronic capitalism, where you reward certain
[18:43.120 --> 18:48.800]  businesses or you require people to buy a certain product. And so what we have with Obamacare is
[18:48.800 --> 18:53.360]  a interesting mixture that reflects what American government currently is, a mixture of socialism
[18:53.360 --> 18:58.080]  and economic fascism or chronic capitalism, if you want to call it that way. And then he went on
[18:58.080 --> 19:02.480]  to say this, he said it's not in anyone's interest for President Obama to become the face of resistance.
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.760]  That's a former Obama aide Eric Schultz who's still his senior advisor. He said when the
[19:07.760 --> 19:12.320]  former president speaks, he consumes a lot of oxygen and he can suppress the next generation
[19:12.320 --> 19:17.280]  of leaders from rising. I thought it was interesting because he said it's not for Obama to become the
[19:17.280 --> 19:22.560]  face of the resistance. We just saw Hillary Clinton celebrating 100 years of Planned Parenthood
[19:23.200 --> 19:30.000]  saying I am the resistance now. Okay, I am joining the resistance. She's channeling Alex Jones.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.360]  She said in the past it's an info war and we're losing it. Now she says she's part of the resistance.
[19:35.360 --> 19:40.240]  Maybe it's Hillary Clinton who's copying Alex Jones and not Barack Obama. But this
[19:40.240 --> 19:45.520]  presidential center that they've got there is absolutely amazing. We're going to take a quick
[19:45.520 --> 19:49.760]  look at that. We're going to take a look at Obamacare and we're going to look at some of these
[19:49.760 --> 19:57.120]  insane videos of the entitled people who think that they can censor other people's speech. Stay
[19:57.120 --> 20:06.000]  with us, we'll be right back. Nearly one-third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involved refugees.

[23:58.480 --> 24:19.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. This Friday, May 5, 2017, I'm David Knight.
[24:19.920 --> 24:26.160]  We've been looking at this amazing statement from Politico. Barack Obama's advisors saying he's
[24:26.160 --> 24:30.800]  very disturbed watching what's happening. It's like watching the business that he built for
[24:30.800 --> 24:35.840]  eight years being ripped down slowly. And as I said before, many of us who had businesses
[24:36.640 --> 24:44.960]  watched and stunned silence as Obama from his throne gradually ripped down our businesses.
[24:44.960 --> 24:52.400]  And for him, he doesn't get the basic idea of business. Business is about sales, really.
[24:52.400 --> 24:57.680]  It's about convincing people that you've got a win-win situation. You offer them something,
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.720]  they agree to the deal. That's not the business that Obama is in. If you want to call it a business,
[25:02.720 --> 25:06.480]  his business is holding a gun to your head and mandating what you're going to do.
[25:07.200 --> 25:12.000]  And that's a big difference between just this Obamacare situation. With Obamacare,
[25:12.960 --> 25:17.440]  everything was a mandate. Everything was a tax. What they're trying to do now is give people
[25:17.440 --> 25:23.280]  incentives, give them tax credits. Did Obama do anything to really help us buy health insurance?
[25:23.280 --> 25:27.280]  No. He gave us a long list of mandates, forced us to buy things that we really didn't need
[25:27.280 --> 25:34.480]  at inflated prices from his friends. See, the people that he knows in business succeed because
[25:34.480 --> 25:40.400]  they use government to hold a gun to your head and force you to buy their product. People like
[25:40.400 --> 25:45.920]  Chobani Yogurt, where they get into the school lunch program and then taxpayers are subsidizing
[25:45.920 --> 25:51.280]  the stuff that's going through the school lunch program. But he makes his business plan by getting
[25:51.280 --> 25:56.320]  subsidies, tax subsidies from the government by this kind of crony capitalism. And so all the
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.520]  people that he knows, the big businesses, the connected individuals, they run their businesses
[26:01.520 --> 26:08.560]  by incorporating subsidies and incorporating mandates on you, taking your tax money.
[26:08.560 --> 26:14.080]  But what is the business that Obama is building right now? Well, he's building a massive monument
[26:14.080 --> 26:20.960]  to himself. Obama is selling himself. And of course, he's selling his brand of socialism. He's
[26:20.960 --> 26:27.600]  unveiling a half billion dollar Obama Presidential Center in Chicago. Pull up this article and show
[26:27.600 --> 26:31.360]  the people some of these pictures of what they're going to do. Now, of course, he's had a $60
[26:31.360 --> 26:38.240]  million book contract to sell himself. He's also rolling out of the speech circuit. He's got $400,000
[26:38.240 --> 26:45.040]  speeches of pop. This is coming from Zero Hedge. But now we've seen the first peak of the future
[26:45.040 --> 26:50.400]  Obama Presidential Center. It's not even a library. It's a center. Library is just part of that.
[26:50.400 --> 26:54.480]  And as they point out on Zero Hedge, it would make the Pharaohs jealous. And guess what? It's
[26:54.480 --> 27:00.640]  going to have a sledding hill. How appropriate? Because Obama's policies have always put us on
[27:00.640 --> 27:08.000]  this slippery slope going downhill. I think that's perfect. That's a perfect metaphor for Obama.
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.840]  A slippery slope. And they're going to feature that there. Of course, they say that it's a
[27:11.840 --> 27:16.480]  sledding hill because Michelle always complained there was nowhere to sled in Chicago when she
[27:16.480 --> 27:22.240]  was a kid. So now they've got it there. And everybody can go to the Obama Center and they
[27:22.240 --> 27:27.920]  can slide downhill, which is what the country did for eight years. Obama is expected to use
[27:27.920 --> 27:34.240]  a center as a platform to work on issues such as criminal justice reform. Is he going to push
[27:34.240 --> 27:40.720]  for the reform of the NDAA where we had indefinite detention without trial by the military? Or were
[27:40.720 --> 27:47.520]  you have assassination of Americans abroad without trial and conviction? That would be a good
[27:47.520 --> 27:51.760]  criminal justice reform, don't you think? No, he's not going to do that. And he's not going to have
[27:51.760 --> 27:56.960]  education for underprivileged children. Guess what kind of education they're going to be getting?
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.520]  They're going to be getting propaganda. There's an interesting article that came out today from
[28:01.520 --> 28:07.360]  phe.org said MIT is making kid-friendly communist propaganda. I would imagine you will be able
[28:07.360 --> 28:13.600]  to find this book in no time at the Obama Library, at the Obama Center in Chicago,
[28:13.600 --> 28:18.240]  you know, that half billion dollar center that they're building. They say that MIT Press is
[28:18.240 --> 28:25.440]  proposing, quote, a different kind of communism, one that is true to the ideals of communism and
[28:25.440 --> 28:31.760]  free from authoritarianism. Okay, so it's new and improved communism. It has 5% less theft,
[28:31.760 --> 28:38.560]  5% less starving, 5% less murder. But it would still be millions of people dying from starvation,
[28:38.560 --> 28:42.720]  murder and theft. As I point out, the death toll from communist regimes in the 20th century is
[28:42.720 --> 28:49.360]  well documented by the tens of millions that have died everywhere from the Russian Revolution to
[28:49.360 --> 28:54.880]  the starvation in China and elsewhere. And Obama may be getting his own comeuppance,
[28:54.880 --> 29:00.080]  because we see from the Daily Mail that Congress is planning to cancel his pension.
[29:00.800 --> 29:06.720]  Following news of his 60 plus million dollar book deal and his $400,000 speaking fees,
[29:06.720 --> 29:10.480]  say Republicans are going to introduce legislation that would cap presidential
[29:10.480 --> 29:16.160]  pensions. Now, Obama vetoed that legislation last year. Isn't that interesting? He didn't
[29:16.160 --> 29:21.360]  want to have his pension taken, but they may take it anyway. I think it would be a great point
[29:21.360 --> 29:25.760]  for Donald Trump and the Republicans to make. The law would reduce pensions by $1 for every
[29:25.760 --> 29:31.360]  dollar, over $400,000 a former president earns. And that would take him down real quickly. But
[29:31.360 --> 29:37.360]  of course, we should have welfare for the rich and privileged like Barack Obama, shouldn't we?
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.320]  Yeah, stay with us. We're going to come back. We got a message from Alex Jones, and we are also
[29:42.320 --> 29:47.520]  going to be looking at the details of the changes to Obamacare that the House passed yesterday.
[29:47.520 --> 29:53.600]  Stay with us. We'll be right back. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[29:54.480 --> 29:57.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.680 --> 30:05.440]  What exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[30:05.440 --> 30:10.320]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses
[30:10.320 --> 30:14.400]  to control public opinion. By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not
[30:14.400 --> 30:18.960]  only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government created viewpoint also
[30:18.960 --> 30:23.200]  influences others in ripple effect. And this is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[30:23.200 --> 30:27.760]  The use psychological manipulation, they turn the public into obedient sheeple. And over time,
[30:27.760 --> 30:32.400]  we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception. But how does political correctness
[30:32.400 --> 30:37.200]  and other deliberate deceptions work? Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their
[30:37.200 --> 30:42.160]  agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted
[30:42.160 --> 30:46.560]  as truth, such as global warming, for example. Then the establishment suppresses any counter
[30:46.560 --> 30:51.280]  arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of
[30:51.280 --> 30:55.200]  manmade climate change, climate deniers. You can learn more about this tyranny over the
[30:55.200 --> 31:00.320]  minds of men at infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, and our YouTube channel Resistance News. This is
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.640]  Kit Daniels reporting. It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that
[31:04.640 --> 31:09.120]  needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial
[31:09.120 --> 31:15.600]  particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based
[31:15.600 --> 31:21.040]  right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have

[31:31.040 --> 31:36.320]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or
[31:36.320 --> 31:42.480]  avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze
[31:42.480 --> 31:48.800]  will be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:48.800 --> 31:53.520]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters
[31:53.520 --> 31:58.400]  that didn't do as good a job. Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.

[34:17.360 --> 34:25.200]  children that are all under assault. We have the Bill Nye the science guy, a 1990s program cutting
[34:25.200 --> 34:31.040]  out where they break down the X and Y chromosomes and what makes us human men and women. Men and
[34:31.040 --> 34:37.280]  women now existing and science is hurtful to someone else. This is the globalist using our
[34:37.280 --> 34:44.000]  well-meaning openness and our tolerance to get us to hate our species and give up on our life force
[34:44.720 --> 34:50.000]  and the attacks calling us fake news by the fake news at CNN and others really show how sick these
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.560]  people are and how they're attempting to shut down free speech. So in the face of the Federal
[34:54.560 --> 35:00.400]  Reserve board members suing us and George Soros' law firm launching the suit and in the face of
[35:00.400 --> 35:07.440]  Google admittedly censoring us, it is we the people of every race, color and creed who bleed
[35:07.440 --> 35:13.040]  red blood the human race that are fighting back and saying no. So again during that 30 plus hour
[35:13.040 --> 35:18.880]  live transmission that kicked off Wednesday and ran right through Thursday, we saw massive massive
[35:18.880 --> 35:24.160]  support spreading the word, spreading the articles and our free newsletters. We can stay in contact
[35:24.160 --> 35:29.280]  infowar.com forward slash newsletter. It's been amazing and the financial support has been incredible
[35:29.280 --> 35:35.120]  as well. Again we're not funded by George Soros. We're actually sued by his law firm. We're not
[35:35.120 --> 35:42.000]  funded by the big Islamic groups. We're actually sued by them. We're not empowered by the establishment.
[35:42.000 --> 35:47.600]  We are empowered by you, your prayers, your support and your financial support. That's why I'm
[35:47.600 --> 35:52.400]  going to go ahead and extend some of the biggest sales we've had in six months right through this

[36:28.640 --> 36:33.040]  20% off winter sun, the vitamin D3 that I take also in the summer as well, but it's
[36:33.040 --> 36:36.800]  essential in the winter because that's how you produce vitamin D mainly, is through the sun

[38:04.560 --> 38:09.840]  three, one, three, nine. But regardless of whether you financially support us or not, pray for us,
[38:09.840 --> 38:16.800]  spread the word about info wars because we can overcome the bots, the Google sensors. We can
[38:16.800 --> 38:22.400]  overcome with human ingenuity their attempts to turn the US and European internet into something
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.720]  that resembles the communist Chinese censored internet. So again, thank you all for your
[38:26.720 --> 38:31.440]  support. Thank you to the crew that does such an amazing job during these marathon broadcasts
[38:32.320 --> 38:35.600]  and thank you to everyone out there who is spreading the word because what you're doing
[38:35.600 --> 38:40.560]  is changing the world. We've been growing, we've been changing the paradigm, we've been waking
[38:40.560 --> 38:46.640]  up millions of people. This is a animating contest of liberty and you're about to see more reporters,
[38:46.640 --> 38:53.680]  more crew, new studios, more field reporters, more action, more victory against the globalist.
[38:53.680 --> 38:59.920]  Their ideology is twisted, evil and weak. Our ideology is based in truth and honor and strength
[38:59.920 --> 39:05.920]  and when good men and women of every color and every creed take action, nothing on earth can
[39:05.920 --> 39:12.000]  stop human development and our long march to the stars in God's great plan. So for myself,
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.120]  Alex Jones and the info wars family, I want to thank you because you are family and I want to
[39:17.760 --> 39:23.680]  just again thank God for all the blessings of creation and all the blessings of consciousness
[39:23.680 --> 39:29.120]  and my children and my family and the amazing tribulations and persecutions that God has carried
[39:29.120 --> 39:35.040]  me personally through. Thank you, God. Thank you for Christ your Son. Thank you for the ultimate
[39:35.040 --> 39:39.840]  sacrifice. Thank you for humbling yourself and becoming one of us. You can experience
[39:39.840 --> 39:45.520]  what we're going through at our level and thank you for forgiving us for the trespasses we've
[39:45.520 --> 39:50.560]  engaged in and not recognizing the incredible gift of consciousness you've given us. So again,
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.360]  to God, thank you to my family. Thank you to the listeners. Thank you and to my crew. Thank you.
[39:55.360 --> 40:03.680]  I love you all. All right. And that was Alex Jones and we do thank you. We do appreciate
[40:03.680 --> 40:07.680]  your support. Thank you so much for supporting us through this time and to give you an idea
[40:08.320 --> 40:11.760]  of the kind of insanity and opposition that we're facing. We're going to play
[40:11.760 --> 40:15.120]  something from Michael Berry in a moment. But before we do, I want to play a quick
[40:15.680 --> 40:20.160]  clip. This is an article we have up on info wars.com. Lawrence Fishburne,
[40:20.160 --> 40:26.640]  you remember the actor who played in the Matrix, he was leader of the rebels in the Matrix.
[40:27.360 --> 40:33.840]  And his daughter had a very interesting drunk driving arrest, which in the middle of this,
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.640]  a lot of things were happening in this. One of the things she did was to blame all of this
[40:38.640 --> 40:44.160]  on Donald Trump. Her drunk driving arrest was the fault of Donald Trump. So let's play a
[40:44.160 --> 40:49.760]  short clip of this and you can see this in the comments on our article. And I want to show you
[40:49.760 --> 40:55.120]  also what they're trying to do in terms of removing Trump when we come back. But let's take a quick
[40:55.120 --> 41:24.480]  look at Lawrence Fishburne's daughter blaming the political situation under Donald Trump for her DUI.
[41:24.480 --> 41:29.840]  There you go. Yeah. And as part of that, it's a longer video, which we don't show there because
[41:30.880 --> 41:36.240]  she's engaged in public urination, showing her bare behind and Donald Trump rent.
[41:37.120 --> 41:43.120]  But you know, it's her entitlement because of this Nazi regime that we have going on. Now,
[41:44.400 --> 41:48.240]  the other day I was going back and forth between work, and I'm not sure which day it was because
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.280]  it's all kind of running together with this 30 hour marathon. We have a story up by Clifford
[41:53.280 --> 41:59.600]  Cunningham at infoworse.com talking about the secret conversations that are being held to impeach
[41:59.600 --> 42:03.760]  Donald Trump. And I, as I was driving, and like I said, I'm not sure which day it was,
[42:03.760 --> 42:10.560]  but I heard NPR talking about it. Of course, this individual, his name is Osnos, is making
[42:10.560 --> 42:16.560]  rounds. He's going, wrote an article on The New Yorker, he's going on MSNBC, he's going on NPR,
[42:16.560 --> 42:22.880]  Fresh Air, Terry Gross, all this stuff, all talking about how he's got all these experts who say that
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.200]  we're going to get Donald Trump impeached. He says he claims to have interviewed several dozen
[42:27.200 --> 42:32.160]  people about the prospects of cutting short Trump's presidency. He's talked to Trump's friends,
[42:32.160 --> 42:36.960]  advisors, to lawmakers, attorneys who have conducted impeachment. He's talked to physicians and
[42:36.960 --> 42:40.960]  historians because they're going to try to say he's crazy, not this lady who was drunk. No,
[42:40.960 --> 42:48.000]  she's not crazy. Donald Trump is crazy. And they point out in this article, and this is something
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.720]  that's very important to remember when we start just, I mean, they're not saying, you know, we
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.480]  look at politicians, they say that person is crazy. I mean, they're really trying to convince you
[42:57.200 --> 43:04.560]  that he has mental illness. And they point out in this article, after Fact Magazine asked
[43:04.560 --> 43:09.440]  psychiatrists during the campaign of Barry Goldwater, if he was psychologically fit to be
[43:09.440 --> 43:15.360]  president, they had a thousand of them say that he was warped, that he was impulsive,
[43:15.360 --> 43:19.840]  that he was paranoid and schizophrenic. You know how they smeared Barry Goldwater with that
[43:20.400 --> 43:24.880]  daisy ad, the nuclear ad and everything. And so he's successfully sued for libel.
[43:25.920 --> 43:31.920]  And we're going to go to Alex Jones in just a couple of minutes. There's breaking news and
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.680]  we got Alex Jones coming in. Let me just finish this paragraph here. What happened
[43:35.680 --> 43:41.680]  with Goldwater? Was he sued them successfully for libel? And then in 1973, and we've had Dr.
[43:41.680 --> 43:46.080]  Bochenik talk about this because he's a psychiatrist. The American Psychiatric Association created the
[43:46.080 --> 43:52.960]  so-called Goldwater Rule, which forbade making a diagnosis without an in-person examination
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.320]  and without permission to discuss their findings in public. So you have to actually do an examination.
[44:00.960 --> 44:05.600]  You know, not some kind of telepathic feeling that you get watching somebody on television.
[44:06.160 --> 44:11.440]  And you have to get your patient's permission to go public. So when we look at all this stuff,
[44:11.440 --> 44:17.600]  I think the key thing here, folks, is that there is a danger when we look at what's going on with
[44:17.600 --> 44:24.000]  his son-in-law Kushner. And this loan, the failure to disclose loans that he got from George Soros,
[44:24.000 --> 44:30.320]  it's not just a bad idea for his political base. It's not just an ethics issue. When you do something
[44:30.320 --> 44:37.600]  like that and you don't sign the paperwork, that is a very, very dangerous thing. And if Trump doesn't
[44:37.600 --> 44:42.000]  cut the ties to that, that could be used to impeach him. I think that's a very dangerous thing.
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.120]  Let's go to Alex. He's got breaking news. Alex.
[44:45.920 --> 44:49.360]  Absolutely, David. You're doing a fabulous job. We thank the crew, the working government,
[44:49.360 --> 44:54.240]  who support last 48 hours in the face of George Soros, who's found a law firm selling us. So
[44:54.240 --> 44:57.760]  remember, the Neutral Reserve is selling us. They're hoping that it is admittedly trying to
[44:57.760 --> 45:01.840]  take us down right now, but we're only expanding in the face of it. But it's incredible. We're so
[45:01.840 --> 45:08.000]  sink that this just broke on InfoWars.com 10 minutes ago. And so I wanted to call in and I
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.440]  asked him, I said, what's David Covery? No, he's Covery Lawrence, which is a great thing.
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.200]  But by the time, which is, I'm glad you did it, supporting Lawrence, his daughter,
[45:15.200 --> 45:18.640]  totally delusional and not taking responsibility for his health, peeing on the side of the road,
[45:18.640 --> 45:23.840]  whatever she was doing, but hanging out. I mean, obviously, if you're drunk, you'll remember.
[45:23.840 --> 45:27.200]  As soon as I go to you, and I'm on hold for a couple of minutes, you're talking about what I
[45:27.200 --> 45:33.280]  called in about this. So ultra massive that we should have it as the top Facebook story,
[45:33.280 --> 45:38.720]  top YouTube. We should really make a huge deal out of this because it's such a big deal,
[45:38.720 --> 45:43.040]  I'm going to actually be calm and I'll let myself get upset. I've studied how governments are
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.200]  taken down. I've studied how the Glogans operate. I've studied what they've done in
[45:47.200 --> 45:52.160]  more than 60 other towns since they've always found some non-repeated operation Ajax and
[45:52.160 --> 45:57.280]  Picky Tree, and I ran right through what happened with Kennedy in 63. It just goes on and on. Ladies
[45:57.280 --> 46:03.200]  and gentlemen, I have sources, but also more important than sources, I have history. And what
[46:03.200 --> 46:08.880]  David Knight was just covering is on informers.com, the Clifford Cunningham article, the New Yorker
[46:08.880 --> 46:12.880]  magazine, or most elite publications where they communicate with each other. He's like,
[46:12.880 --> 46:17.680]  it went out in a month. We were coming to Times of London. In that publication, they're saying,
[46:17.680 --> 46:24.080]  oh, how we could fire again, not the people, but the globalists, the Republican establishment,
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.160]  the Democratic establishment, people that don't like the fact he killed TPP and it was supposed
[46:28.160 --> 46:33.200]  to swallow our sovereignty, people that don't like. He's getting so observed, actually make banks,
[46:33.200 --> 46:38.480]  make loans to small businesses. The fact that they don't want him to actually turn the economy on,
[46:38.480 --> 46:42.400]  he is a real president. He is trying to bring power back to America. He's doing some things
[46:42.400 --> 46:47.680]  in our permanent compromises, but they will still try to destroy him because he is good. He is real.
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.080]  He's irrevocably hurting political correctness. He's making us feel good about ourselves again.
[46:52.080 --> 46:55.280]  He's getting on the roll of the stock market, all of it. We were supposed to already be in a
[46:55.280 --> 46:59.680]  controlled global depression by now that we're going to bring in social unrest, you name it,
[46:59.680 --> 47:05.520]  and consolidate. So understand, I said after he won on November 8th, I said, the real war is about
[47:05.520 --> 47:10.480]  to start. He's for real. They're going to use COG, the economy, the government system. And now
[47:10.480 --> 47:15.920]  they have shows out with you for several and to your buddy used to this called the all-trend or
[47:15.920 --> 47:21.520]  whatever, where some other term to the point is that he's part of the shadow government. And so
[47:21.520 --> 47:26.160]  he gets put in as the all-trend of the government. They're now preparing everyone. They start bringing
[47:26.160 --> 47:30.960]  out secret COG stuff, maybe one out of a thousand people. They're about academics,
[47:30.960 --> 47:36.400]  researchers 20 years ago, things we've been covering for 22 years. When they start saying,
[47:36.400 --> 47:40.640]  oh, COG's no big deal. Oh, group of psychologists and psychiatrists. Oh, secret members and
[47:40.640 --> 47:48.320]  toddlers. Oh, both parties. Oh, members of his own team, his own closest associates. Oh,
[47:48.320 --> 47:54.480]  the families see it and threaten it and everything. And then customers, the control of Soros and all
[47:54.480 --> 47:58.400]  the rest of it. And so they're saying, look, you just ruined your father-in-law, or we're going to
[47:58.400 --> 48:04.240]  bring you down basically. And so Trump is totally surrounded. In 106 days, they've already partially
[48:04.240 --> 48:08.640]  repealed Obamacare and they're devastating the globalist operation. Even though, let's say,
[48:08.640 --> 48:13.520]  he's a battleship with 12 guns, maybe eight of them are firing right now. And as every month goes
[48:13.520 --> 48:18.480]  by, more of his guns get knocked out. But still, still, we're taking them down at the same time as
[48:18.480 --> 48:22.400]  like a video game at the end of the level where you're fighting the boss and your energy's going
[48:22.400 --> 48:27.120]  down, but his energy's going down. We are bleeding the globalist out, but Penn's set to win. And
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.680]  like you were saying, the Nationalism Turbo is starting. So they're attacking with Penn, the
[48:31.680 --> 48:37.760]  Canadian forward. Trump, Nigel Farage, they try to kill him three times. That's, you know,
[48:37.760 --> 48:41.360]  was off the record in the news. Hey, Matt, I can report it that he definitely knows
[48:41.360 --> 48:46.240]  they're trying to kill him. He's been told, retired or dead. Well, he retired if they would
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.080]  actually follow their promise to get making on sovereign again, but they didn't. They backed off.
[48:50.080 --> 48:52.960]  Please get ready to run for prime minister. You know, they've said you're a dead man.
[48:52.960 --> 48:57.040]  So he has incredible courage. I've obviously been told the same things about very serious people.
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.480]  So post if there says, is it a game? Trump is in an arena death battle. I've used that term
[49:02.480 --> 49:06.320]  guest trouble death battle. A lot of Democrats use it because that is what this is. This is no
[49:06.320 --> 49:09.840]  quarter. We're not giving them quarter. We're not giving them quarter. We just want to restore
[49:09.840 --> 49:16.800]  the Republican prosperity. They want a North Korea meets TAX 11 free aid model and everybody
[49:16.800 --> 49:20.640]  out of the claims they're liberal or conservative to realize these fake crisis when Democrats
[49:20.640 --> 49:26.480]  and Republicans are totally in complete theater. They're not real. When you see real attacks,
[49:26.480 --> 49:30.880]  though, on Trump and all these attempts to promote killing him and stuff, that's because he is real.
[49:30.880 --> 49:35.280]  He is real. I've got a crew of 65 people. They're all great people, but still we have problems.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.920]  Directors get, you know, get, get messed up. I, I, a lot of it's my fault.
[49:40.560 --> 49:44.320]  Imagine having 4,000 people under you and then you're interfaced with over 2 million federal
[49:44.320 --> 49:48.880]  employees and then millions and millions of contractors and major corporations. They're
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.600]  doing whatever they want. They're running rampant. They're arrogant. They're sabotaging you. And
[49:53.600 --> 49:58.560]  now that they are openly in, now that they are openly in the New Yorker matters, he's saying
[49:58.560 --> 50:03.040]  behind the scenes are looking at his overthrow, not just his impeachment. And they're talking
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.800]  about using COG. Even if they don't have the votes, they are trying to get people ready and
[50:06.800 --> 50:14.080]  lined up to normalize this in the bureaucracy for an assassination or for an overthrow or you
[50:14.080 --> 50:17.920]  name it and believe me, the Democrats and the Republican leadership side, they're going to call
[50:17.920 --> 50:23.840]  everyone Russians who got elected from the freedom caucus. And the Republican freedom caucus are
[50:23.840 --> 50:27.760]  great people, by the way. Some of them are warmers rather than that. And when it comes to sovereign

[54:27.040 --> 54:33.360]  is done over and over and over and over again so we even have ultramassive crime taking place but
[54:33.360 --> 54:37.760]  the globalist and and in myself everybody else we just kind of halfway accepted the reason we've been
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.400]  so successful against them is i do raise the alarm David raise the alarm we really get upset about
[54:42.400 --> 54:46.240]  what's going on notice go quietly for the night but here's here's the headline of the whole show

[54:50.080 --> 54:55.920]  article which is excellent but it's very dry it's kind of like reporting you know hitler invaded

[55:02.320 --> 55:06.160]  not criticizing cutting down just saying he'd rather reported it as should the new yorker
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.560]  magazine the elites admit they're in congress they're everywhere this is the shadow government
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.000]  coming out and announcing plans to overthrow the president the elected president and their

[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:29.680]  to take a look at the house plan and the process ahead of us because you still got to get through
[1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:33.680]  the senate and the senate says well we're going to write our own bill we're not really going to pay
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:38.000]  any attention to that i think they're going to take a look at it but then there are senators on
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:43.440]  both sides of course when cnn looks at the seven republican senators they say we need to watch on
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:50.240]  this health care bill they look at the liberal ones like uh susan collins lisa murkowski and rob
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:56.880]  portman and this is true folks cnn says each of these less ideologically driven senators of our
[1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:03.760]  voice concerns no no these liberal senators these liberal republicans who are to the left of many
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:08.720]  democrats oh they're not ideological at all see that's same thing we see happening in france
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:16.560]  they always talk about macron is being centrist and he is moderate and anybody who takes a
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:22.240]  globalist establishment approach whether republicans here in this country or whether they're
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:28.400]  globalists abroad in france the mainstream media always calls them centrists they call them moderates
[1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:34.400]  the republicans who are opposing any changes at all to obama care were always talked about as being
[1:01:34.400 --> 1:01:42.720]  centrists and moderates they never call them hardline socialists they never call them socialist
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:50.000]  extremists okay or globalist extremists they never use the words extremism unless they say far right
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:56.800]  they never call these people far left globalists or extreme globalists they never use those types
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:02:00.720]  of languages or we're also going to take a look at some of the back and forth this going on in
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:06.080]  france it's actually kind of funny of the rhetoric going on there but i want to stay focused in this
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:10.560]  segment on the article that we were just talking about i was talking about it alex talked about
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:16.480]  it uh it's at info wars dot com congress is holding quote-unquote secret conversations
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:21.840]  about removing trump this is by cliford cunningham and of course it focuses on the new yorker magazine
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:28.880]  article written by a man named osnos and he's been making the liberal talk radio circuit going on ms mbc
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:34.160]  going on mpr and as i was reading from the article saying understand what they did to
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:41.840]  bury goldwater in 1964 you know that they smeared him as a crazy dr strange love character with his
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:48.800]  finger on the nuclear button hit they had the daisy ad that aired only once and then the media kept
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.880]  running it over and over again implying uh that he was going to uh put us into war what did lbj do
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:02.080]  he he escalated vietnam uh had absolutely no management of it whatsoever he was a very dangerous
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:08.480]  warmongering demagogue but of course goldwater who was really grounded he was rational and he was
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:14.320]  principled but he just wasn't a globalist okay they did everything they could to destroy him
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:18.800]  and so what they did back in 1964 they had a magazine go out and had a thousand psychiatrists
[1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:23.920]  call him warped impulsive paranoid schizophrenic he successfully sued them for libel and nine years
[1:03:23.920 --> 1:03:29.680]  later the american psychiatric association came up with the goldwater rule that said that you're
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:36.000]  not going to make a diagnosis from afar and you're not going to talk about it even if this person
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.160]  is your patient you're not going to diagnose people who aren't your patient that you're
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.520]  going to diagnose over the television okay and if they are your patient you're going to have to
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.480]  exercise doctor patient privileges you're going to have to get their permission to talk about it
[1:03:50.480 --> 1:03:56.080]  in public well they did it a thousand times had a thousand psychiatrists smear very goldwater because
[1:03:56.080 --> 1:04:01.920]  first they have to destroy your character so they can destroy you or assassinate your character so
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:09.600]  they can assassinate you and they've done it now with donald trump more than 50 000 times so 50
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:14.720]  times the number of people out there smearing donald trump with this signing a petition
[1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:19.040]  saying that he's too mentally ill to perform the duties of the presidency and then we have democrat
[1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:25.280]  senator mark warner of virginia quoted by osnos and others saying that this is a guy who is the
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:30.480]  ranking democrat on the intelligence committee hearing uh intelligence committee i should say
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:36.080]  privately told his friends that he puts the odds at two to one against trump completing a full term
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:44.240]  and bill crystal the always never trump or even after donald trump shot the missiles into syria
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:49.120]  and we had other people with his publication uh like elliot abrams come out say he's finally
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:53.200]  president bill crystal says no i think there's a pretty good chance he's going to get impeached
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:59.120]  they are going to stab him in the back this thing you cannot trust these establishment
[1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:04.560]  globalist never trump or neocons we'll be right back we all know that when the democratic party
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:11.440]  blamed hillary clinton's loss on the russians it was the biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:16.880]  but it seems now the vice president of the democratic political firm global strategy group
[1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:24.160]  said that according to their analysis two thirds of the voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up
[1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:30.960]  leaving the democratic party to vote for trump so 70 of the reason hillary clinton loss can be
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:37.600]  attributed to her failure to pick up these prior obama voters she claims to be part of the resistance
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:43.920]  but even antifa doesn't want her there have even been rumors circulating that she may try to run
[1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:51.520]  again in 2020 rob snider recently tweeted at this point i believe a judge should grant america

[1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:38.240]  have an article up on info wars dot com new york times smears lepen and french patriots as
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:43.360]  racist extremists and of course we had a very interesting debate the other night the election
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:49.360]  is going to be on sunday and we talked about this a little bit yesterday uh breitbart had a story
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:54.800]  macron's deplorables moment and as i said it's really probably more of a legniz robb you know
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.440]  where he's calling them hateful cowards he's going all this stuff and it kind of reminded me we read
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:04.240]  these insults it's kind of like uh monty python's holy grail if you remember where they go up and
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:13.280]  do a siege on the french castle and the french guy comes out and taunts them so you look at this
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:18.320]  macron the taunts that he has out here it's almost like you stupid nationalist types
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:24.400]  i fart in your general direction he goes they're here it's they it's they who are true enemies
[1:09:24.400 --> 1:09:29.920]  these nationalists they are powerful organized skillful determined you pass them in the streets
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:37.600]  the countryside the web most often well hidden hateful cowardly you know them there he is i think
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:43.120]  sounding as either the party of the agents of disaster fear mongers the french far right it's
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:50.720]  here they use anger they propagate lies for decades they have fan hatred fomented divisions
[1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:57.280]  impose their discourse on discrimination so then the hurling of the uh livestock begins
[1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:04.480]  that was the french debate okay very much like the umani python uh sieging of the castle
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:12.880]  marina penn came back and had a great uh reply she said the reality is you went to see merkel
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:18.480]  they're out the cows to throw you went to and here's where she throws her cow okay she says the
[1:10:18.480 --> 1:10:25.520]  reality is you have to see merkel and you asked her for her as for her blessing because you plan
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:30.400]  to do nothing without her agreement and it goes well of course i want friends to measure up to
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:37.360]  germany she said let me tell you what happened france will be led by a woman it'll be either me
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:43.840]  or it'll be miss merkel and that's the truth and that is the truth he is a globalist he has a
[1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:49.280]  globalist puppet this is a guy who is a ross child banker it's pretty amazing really when
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:57.760]  you look at it this guy does some uh uh he buys his way out of a government obligation to do some
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:02.960]  service there and he goes to work for the ross child for a couple years comes back fabulously
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:09.200]  wealthy they put him in a socialist regime and what he does there is he destroys the popularity of
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:14.800]  halan the guy who did not run for reelection first time a french socialist has not run for
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:20.960]  reelection he destroyed his credibility because he implemented austerity programs from a french
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:25.280]  socialist perspective it was a socialist party that was in power and they hired this ross child
[1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:32.080]  banker and he implemented these eu austerity programs that were antithetical to what the
[1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:38.320]  socialist party was about that's why there was a split in the socialist party that's why he had that
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:44.880]  one guy that that rapidly rose up finished third or fourth the first four people are very closely
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:52.160]  tied he's now thrown his support behind marina penn because he is not for the european union he
[1:11:52.160 --> 1:11:57.120]  wants to have these decisions decided in france so this is really split the socialist party
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:02.800]  bringing this banker into the socialist party and of course he he quit so that he could run for
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:11.120]  president and his party is called in march or just move on if you will okay yes it's the the youth
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:17.440]  the soros people it's the same pattern we see in every one of these countries the soros organizations
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:22.560]  coming in there march on right and then hillary clinton is of course creating another anti-trump
[1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:26.960]  uh group and it's going to be called onward together so this is the thing it's let's move on
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:31.680]  and it's like i wish you would move on and go back to the little rock that you crawled from under
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:36.320]  at least come back with a different slogan right well it just kind of shows you how globally they're
[1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:42.800]  all colluding together to move on and onward together uh but it's just incredible how the
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:48.720]  actual fake news is that they are trying to paint this guy as the outsider when he is totally an
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:54.800]  insider he's a globalist he was put in there and what we're seeing in the in the last debate that
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:59.680]  they had uh where le penne kind of gave him a little jab and she said well you know i hate to
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:06.080]  find out that you have some offshore uh account in the bahamas where you're evading taxes and so
[1:13:06.080 --> 1:13:11.520]  now he uh macron is actually suing le penne over these kremlin smears where have we heard all of
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:17.360]  this before yeah they're all onward together with the with the russian agents and russian in
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:22.800]  election interference but he's basically suing her accusing her of smearing him with these fake
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:29.440]  claims of tax evasion meanwhile the french media refuses to report on anything or doing any digging
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:36.400]  and forechan is actually posting images from macron's offshore bank account allegedly um and
[1:13:36.400 --> 1:13:42.240]  these images show this llc operating agreement it's not in the bahamas it's in the cayman island
[1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:47.840]  well there you go so it was fake news it doesn't have an offshore account in the bahamas it's in
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:52.240]  the cayman islands right because they cut him a better deal right and so that's just that's what
[1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:56.800]  i think but we're not going to hear about this in the french media as was watson's been pointing
[1:13:56.800 --> 1:14:01.920]  out you see all the magazines on all the newsstands it's all macron and he's just handsome and some
[1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:07.120]  of him has his shirt off and you can see his six pack and it's obvious what they're trying to do
[1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:11.680]  there it's almost like putting uh hillary clinton in all the halo photos well just look at the
[1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:18.400]  headlines from afp after the debate macron convinces the majority of french viewers in a tv in other
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:22.480]  words he's the winner he's convinced have you been convinced that's what they do with their
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:27.920]  push polling they tell everybody that uh he won the debate and people want him to win the election
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:32.560]  and so forth and so on they're saying that he's ahead 60 40 but then we have these other articles
[1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:36.800]  where you have people saying wait a minute are we going to make the same mistake we did with the
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:43.440]  american election are we going to ignore the fact that there's an energized base here that is going
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:48.000]  to show up that hasn't showed up in previous elections that maybe we're not even polling remember
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:55.200]  when some people in a democrat party said uh yeah you know the problem is we didn't even poll rural
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:14:59.760]  white america because we didn't think they were relevant anymore right and so that's one of the
[1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:06.080]  things is happening here so there's a lot of there isn't any enthusiasm for macron and there is a lot
[1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:12.160]  of enthusiasm for marine le pen and the rural areas it is breaking down very much like we see
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:17.040]  here in america and that's there's a reason for that folks you know we have a very different culture
[1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:21.600]  from the french people and we're not going to be promoting the kind of uh you know french word
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:26.880]  laissez-faire uh they have abandoned laissez-faire in france they're pretty much of a socialist
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:33.440]  government control orientation but nevertheless when we look at nationalism we all understand
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:37.840]  that we want the french to be able to be french we want the mexicans to be able to be mexicans
[1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:43.520]  the americans to be able to be americans of the british to be british so forth that is true
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:50.400]  multiculturalism it is the globalists who want to eradicate this rich tapestry of cultures
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:57.920]  and homogenize us down to the lowest level possible so they can control us from a one
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:03.840]  world government so we want to have this kind of variety this kind of true multiculturalism
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:07.440]  we just don't want to have it forced upon us in certain areas we want people to have freedom of
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:14.000]  association to have freedom of culture to have borders and laws of their own choosing rather
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.840]  than having it imposed upon us from a centralized position of control which is what the globalist
[1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:25.120]  hardline left extremists want okay let's call the globalists the extremists and the hardliners
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.800]  because that's what they are well david perfect example i was just reading a story this morning
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:33.760]  about how venice italy is actually just they're having such an issue with the massive amount of
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:39.920]  tourism that's coming in there and then with that there are a lot of kebab shops and and pizza by
[1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:44.000]  the slice they're popping up and so all these tourists are coming in and they're just grabbing
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:48.880]  their food to go and then taking it to the monuments and the sites and then leaving their trash
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:55.200]  everywhere but all the actual shops and the local produce and the local businesses that make up
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:17:00.960]  venice italy they're not getting any tourism flow because they're just going to these quick things
[1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:05.120]  and then getting back on their cruise ship or you know however they get in well it's the same thing
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:09.440]  they're making a law saying look you're you're deteriorating the very culture of venice italy
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:15.520]  that you've come here to see that's right i know that when we first went to britain london in the
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:20.160]  1980s my wife and i and and there were all these small individual shops just like there were in
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:24.720]  america at one point in time and then you have the big multinational hamburger places that come in
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:31.440]  and drive everybody out of business and so you lose what made an area unique and that's what
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:36.400]  you're talking about in venice the fact that the multinationals come in and they homogenize
[1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:41.840]  everything they take out what is unique in that area they drive the small businesses the mom and
[1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:48.240]  pops if you will britain was known as a nation of shopkeepers well no more because the shopkeepers
[1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:54.080]  are being driven out of business by centralized control by amazon or whatever but it's in the
[1:17:54.080 --> 1:18:00.640]  food areas it's the big multinational conglomerates that come in right well and then so kind of back
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:05.040]  to what's going on with the election there in france remember we reported on this back in
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:11.040]  february that facebook and google are actually joining to help fight the fake news ahead of the
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:16.880]  french elections after they saw what happened here they weren't able to curtail the rising tide of
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:20.880]  the alternative media and people getting their information from sources other than the mainstream
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:26.160]  news mainstream propaganda channels they said well we can't let this happen in france so facebook
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:32.880]  and google got ahead to help stop stories from spreading during france's election but that's
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:40.720]  there even this this latest news with macron's potential offshore account is spreading like
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:47.040]  wildfire to the point that prosecutors in paris are actually opening up investigations into people
[1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:53.120]  like jack posobic here in in the u.s because his name is huge on this on this internet algorithm
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:58.880]  saying look he is one of the main purveyors of this fake news we what can we do how can we stop him
[1:19:00.080 --> 1:19:05.040]  you know and so this is this is just what's so interesting to see will they be successful in
[1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:11.200]  shutting down these posts and stopping the free information from being able to spread so they
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:17.040]  can get in their establishment well i think what you're seeing kind of parallels in some respects
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:22.560]  the way that people are successfully competing against the bland multinationals you know they
[1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:29.680]  come in with their bleached out hamburgers and synthetic stuff and the way that people compete
[1:19:29.680 --> 1:19:38.400]  against that is to have authentic rich counter food to that and the trouble is that the tourists
[1:19:38.400 --> 1:19:42.640]  don't know where to go so they fall back on what they're familiar with but when you talk about the
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:47.440]  people who live there when you talk about information people want something that is authentic
[1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:52.560]  that's the key thing and so that's the struggle that they have they're offering us this bland fast
[1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:56.800]  food version of information and nobody's buying it stay with us to be right back good point

[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:22.880]  we've been talking about the upcoming french election that's coming up this sunday it's
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:28.480]  going to be very interesting it's a big test of nationalism versus globalism but it is even more
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:35.280]  than just a test this will truly be the death knell of the e you if france leaves in addition to
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:42.080]  britain that will be leaving essentially the germans by themselves with only themselves to
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:46.720]  boss around instead of other people so before we go to a video that we got which is really
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:52.400]  interesting because we look at the issues before the french people of course a big part of this
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:57.120]  is the open borders that's what the globalists want to do they want to homogenize societies
[1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:02.080]  they want to create chaos and conflict bring in terrorism and so this is a big part of the
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:10.000]  referendum and we have a video here of some pro migrant french being asked to house a refugee
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:14.560]  and you'll see what their answers are very interesting very revealing before we get

[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:42.560]  play this video here go ahead so this is the w9 television channel they sent a man out you know
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:47.600]  what do you think about this massive arrival of migrants in france and everyone's like it's great
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:57.440]  we're a welcoming country it's positive do we have to welcome them yes of course but they also
[1:26:57.440 --> 1:27:03.440]  deserve it and then it sort of says to as well would you be ready to welcome a migrant in your
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:10.640]  house of course yes i would love to do that my house is open for them oh we just so happen to
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:15.440]  have slobodan right here he needs a place to stay tonight he's been traveling for two weeks he's
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:21.200]  very hungry he needs a shower wait a minute you're kind of putting me on the spot here uh you know
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:27.840]  um uh for me tonight it's a little bit rude to ask me you know right in front of them so when you
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:34.560]  put them on the spot they're like uh no i can't no not tonight i'll put them up in a hotel someone
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:44.240]  gives them 20 bucks go go get a meal here's a shower and that's that's what it is i'd rather
[1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:48.080]  give them money for lunch that's not exactly possible so there you go yeah let's let them
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:52.800]  let them put their refugee where their mouth is they deserve to be here it's not just that we need
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:57.360]  to bring them in the country they deserve to be here and that's we you know we did this exact
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:03.040]  same video when we were having the um influx with all of these and unaccompanied minors from across
[1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:08.080]  the border and we did the same thing went out and said well here's this petition will you sign it to
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:11.920]  say that you'll allow them in your house we'll take your name your address and as soon as they arrive
[1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:16.400]  we'll send them over and then they were like whoa wait a minute i have to take care of them i mean
[1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.720]  that's the thing it's like yeah who who who where are they going to go who do you think is going to
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:25.120]  take care of them and let's play the video that we've got of the syrian refugees we had the same

[1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:14.480]  biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever but it seems now the vice president of the democratic
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:20.720]  political firm global strategy group said that according to their analysis two thirds of the
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:28.560]  voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the democratic party to vote for trump so 70%
[1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:34.800]  of the reason hillary clinton loss can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior obama
[1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:40.960]  voters she claims to be part of the resistance but even anti-fah doesn't want her there have even
[1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:48.480]  been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020 rob snider recently tweeted at this
[1:30:48.480 --> 1:30:54.800]  point i believe a judge should grant america a restraining order against hillary clinton

[1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:25.680]  joneshow i'm david night here with leanne macadoun as we were going to break you saw that video
[1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:31.280]  first in france where they said uh i'll talk to all these people and said yeah yeah we love
[1:33:31.280 --> 1:33:35.200]  refugees want them to come in well um we got one right here you're going to take them and they all
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:40.160]  demure then you had the one that was a little bit older talking about syrian refugees and
[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:44.080]  everybody said yeah we got the statue of liberty you really need to know what that's about certainly
[1:33:44.080 --> 1:33:48.400]  i want refugees to come in well will you give us your address and sign up for this and they all
[1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:51.680]  start demuring and many of them i thought was interesting because of course this is new york
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:58.720]  they have very small apartments and guess what you are going to have a smaller apartment you're
[1:33:58.720 --> 1:34:04.880]  going to have a smaller home you're going to lose your ability to own homes if we open up our borders
[1:34:04.880 --> 1:34:10.400]  to unlimited numbers of people coming in here that we say we're going to give them a free education
[1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:16.080]  just that alone will destroy your home your ability your american dream because we have to educate
[1:34:16.080 --> 1:34:22.080]  the dreamers so you can sacrifice the american dream so that you can provide a free education
[1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:26.240]  for anyone who wants to come here no matter the number we don't have any say about that that's
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:31.280]  going to be the globalist and the european union and the people at the un who are going to decide
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:35.680]  how many people we bring in here and of course we're going to have to educate them in the language
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:40.960]  of their choice we don't even want to try to create an american culture that's based on english
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:46.400]  as a matter of fact uh john claude yunker one of your u uh officials president i think is his
[1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:52.080]  official title there said uh we're going to stop speaking english altogether i do not like english
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.960]  okay so they're going to they don't like our cultures they don't like us we saw it from macron he
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:00.880]  doesn't like anybody who's nationalist it doesn't matter whether you're english or whether you're
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:04.960]  french it doesn't like the french these people want to destroy every culture that they're in but
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:10.000]  you're going to lose your home you're going to be put in a tiny shoebox and it's going to be far
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:15.520]  more expensive than it is now because one of the biggest costs of your home are the property taxes
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:21.120]  that you pay for education and that is exploding everywhere that we have this uncontrolled immigration
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:27.200]  i want to go to the other part of what we've been talking about of course in the last 30 hours
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:31.840]  we've been doing this uh well actually it ended yesterday uh it seems like it's still going
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:39.440]  but uh we had the 30 hour mega broadcast because there's so much attack on free speech in general
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:44.160]  and on info wars in particular and a good example of this is a gentleman his name is michael de barry
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:49.840]  you can find him on youtube you can also find him in new orleans uh my wife and i uh took a trip to
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:53.600]  new orleans and we saw him there in the corner of the french corner he's got a business that's set up
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:58.800]  there he's got a stand he sells t-shirts other things like that and he's got displays you can't
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:04.160]  miss it he's got displays about info wars and alex jones and donald trump uh he's dressed up like uncle
[1:36:04.160 --> 1:36:08.400]  sam most of the time and he engages people in conversations and he has some very interesting
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:12.720]  conversations he puts them up on his youtube channel here's one of the interesting conversations
[1:36:12.720 --> 1:36:18.320]  we did an article about it paul joseph watson a crazed leftist wants alex jones killed
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:22.960]  she says he brainwashes people he should be killed and we're going to play this video for you here
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:28.000]  she says um he says ma'am alex jones you're saying needs to be killed is that what you're
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:34.160]  saying she said yeah i am he says i want alex jones to be taken out taken out for brainwashing
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:40.960]  and she says she's a teacher but then like most teachers she doesn't brainwash she doesn't brainwash
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:45.760]  anybody right but she doesn't want to hear other opinions and she knows better than you
[1:36:45.760 --> 1:36:50.800]  and at one point she burst inexplicitly into tears before saying my son has been completely brainwashed
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:56.560]  by this a-hole and then uh they get into all of this and i want to i'll just let you uh watch
[1:36:56.560 --> 1:37:04.160]  this as it unfolds here's michael de bary talking to a teacher who doesn't like a conflict of ideas
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.880]  she doesn't want to marketplace of ideas she just wants to take out anybody that she disagrees with
[1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:13.680]  especially especially alex jones let's start with info wars we'll kill them first and then
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:20.000]  we'll come for the rest of you remember the pastor in germany okay let's play this uh clip of michael
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:26.080]  mary you're saying someone that gets up there and speaks you want to kill them is that what you're
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:33.840]  saying no no no no no no you're going to stay right i have nowhere to vent what i have to say
[1:37:33.840 --> 1:37:39.600]  let me do it here because it doesn't matter alex jones needs to be killed it doesn't matter
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:43.760]  famous last word so what do you got against free speech okay you know what do you got against free

[1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:16.880]  morning you want to get killed you want to basically you want to eliminate free speech
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:22.880]  how do you hold how do you say you support free speech and at the same time want to stop someone
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:28.480]  from practicing would you please tell me how you hold those two thoughts in your head and get
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:37.200]  justified when someone does something against my first amendment you better believe i'm going to

[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:15.920]  i'd rather than listen to what the man has to say maybe he's saying something that makes sense
[1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:21.520]  now maybe your son is right you want to kill free speech you don't even get your son credit
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:27.440]  to have his own mind you are that bad you don't give a about your son or anybody else lady

[1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:45.600]  not all affected it might be yourself i think you're the frame damage one lady you're the one
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:58.480]  that's pissing all over the first a minute let's go you better seek help see what he goes out what
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:04.160]  the free speech that you want to kill i suppose you're all for that berkeley riots but for them
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:10.160]  stopping in calter is she bad too should we tell her how about malo the comedian how about the
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:16.320]  comedian that they stopped in perfect you you want him killed how many people you want killed
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:22.960]  that you don't agree with lady tell me how much totalitarian nazi you got in you
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:30.480]  oh you don't get it all right that's good let's let's go back here you know and he's exactly
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:37.440]  right it is uh nazi the totalitarian bs you know was pastor martin emuler he was a christian he said
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:40.560]  you know first they came for this group i didn't do anything because i wasn't a member of that group
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:44.880]  and they came for another another another and then they came for me and there was nobody left
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:51.680]  to save me they're coming for alex every day there's another uh attack on alex jones attack on
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:56.800]  info wars and as you have seen even with fox news show first they single out this person or that
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:02.000]  person they they do it with the trump administration they isolate they attack they take down they move
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:08.800]  to the next one they don't stop and she stands there going on and on and on trying to convince him
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:13.440]  that it's a perfectly rational thing well she's take out alex jones well she starts crying too
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:19.520]  it's it's back it's my feelings i've been offended and i'm hurt and i feel like my child's been brain
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:23.840]  washed and so because it hurts my feelings and i don't agree with it he needs to be taken out
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:28.240]  they tell you where your kids are brainwashed when you send them to college i mean we talked
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:34.160]  about this over and over again we sent them to the university california system that has uh janet
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:41.680]  napolitano as the president of the entire university system they think they don't want any
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:46.560]  free speech and so these are the people and here she is as a teacher i'm i'm going to explain to
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:50.480]  you rationally and and you know she's very cold-blooded about it except for the point where
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.440]  she starts to cry about her son who listened to alex and was convinced she doesn't want to
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:41:59.680]  convince you that alex is wrong she wants to convince you that alex needs to be taken out of
[1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:05.120]  shock okay which is what you you see in the response to alex when he went on with pierce morgan you
[1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:09.520]  know let's let's just take him out and and uh shoot him wearing a uniform remember when they
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:13.280]  uh did that that's uh and that was perfectly okay to make those death threats just like it's been
[1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:19.120]  perfectly okay to make death threats against president trump and to have how many was it 50
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:24.400]  thousand mental health professionals signing a petition claiming trump is too seriously mentally
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:29.440]  ill to perform the duties of president and should be removed under the 25th amendment i think those
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:34.080]  medical i mean yeah those medical professionals we ought to take that list and turn it over to
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:38.720]  the american psychiatric psychiatric profession say yeah you need to look at these people's
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:43.840]  credentials and maybe disbar them because you've already set up your own rules saying you're not
[1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:49.120]  going to do this kind of witch hunt with very gold water so these people need to be the ones who
[1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:53.920]  are investigated because they're out there making pronouncements about somebody that they don't know
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:58.880]  anything about exactly they public persona exactly they haven't personally treated him
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:03.920]  or even probably spoken to him whatsoever but based on their political leanings and their
[1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:08.640]  perspective and the way they see the world they can determine that this man is crazy so do you
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:13.360]  think that they might perhaps do this in their own practice with someone else who's coming in
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.440]  thinking well here's the bottom line i disagree with your politics you're crazy what they're doing
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:21.840]  is they're using their credentials they're abusing their credentials they're saying because i'm a
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:27.840]  doctor and because as a doctor i don't follow any of the rules by the american psychiatric
[1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:34.080]  association for ethics i just diagnose people from afar if they were my my patient i would
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:38.400]  release their information without getting a clearance for them so because i don't follow any
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:45.040]  of these ethics rules because i don't really do a real examination but i went to school once and
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:49.600]  i got a degree and i have credentials so therefore you should listen to me even though everything
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:54.560]  that i'm doing is totally unprofessional totally unethical still pay attention to me because i
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:59.680]  signed my name as part of this petition those 50 000 people who did that need to be looked at
[1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:05.760]  by their respective professional associations because they are abusing their professional
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:10.960]  credentials and that's that's what needs to be investigated for political purposes and we see
[1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:15.200]  that with climate change we see that over and over again with climate change they don't argue the
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:22.960]  facts they argue that i'm an authority listen to me i'm telling you what's going on and i have seen
[1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:28.000]  this so many times of people making false pronouncements i've i've pulled us out many times the
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:33.520]  articles that we had from professionals uh 30 35 years ago talking about how we're going to be out
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:39.600]  of oil by the mid 1980s and we're going to be out of gas by the late 1980s and so forth and so on
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:43.440]  suit nonsense we're going to have global we're going to go into water yeah we're going to go
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:48.640]  into a new ice age now we're going to go on to to global warming and what we're going it was
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:54.080]  because of nitrogen now it's because of carbon dioxide it's just on and on and on these pronouncements
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:45:00.640]  these people make not backed up by any facts and dire projections that cannot be tested their models
[1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:05.680]  that cannot be tested and we know that they're rigging even their measurements so but you know
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:10.400]  their authorities and we need to listen to them because they've got a job somewhere in a university
[1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:15.120]  or there's somebody like al gore what does al gore know about science he doesn't know any more about
[1:45:15.120 --> 1:45:21.040]  it than the bill nye i mean exactly these people are scientists the inconvenient truth is that you
[1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.800]  got it all wrong that's the that's the and now they're going to have inconvenient truth 2.0 i mean
[1:45:28.320 --> 1:45:33.120]  really people are still going to buy your crap after you totally got everything wrong and that
[1:45:33.120 --> 1:45:37.360]  now we've got their updated data and then they don't explain to you that the hurt they say well
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:42.480]  the hurricane cycles are on the rise we're seeing more intense but what they don't tell you is that
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:48.080]  they stopped calculating the data prior to 1980 that showed that hurricanes were actually they
[1:45:48.080 --> 1:45:52.560]  had been declining so now they're naturally rising back up but they don't show you that they just want
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:57.920]  you to understand the data that fits into their political agenda and that's why when i see this
[1:45:57.920 --> 1:46:02.720]  thing about trump and these congress holding secret conversations and these doctors what a
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:08.240]  dangerous precedent for psychiatrists to be able to determine someone's crazy because they don't agree
[1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:12.640]  with your politics and they just want to observe you from the outside imagine how many people out
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:19.760]  there are on psychiatric drugs because of because some person is actually going beyond their
[1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:24.480]  professional capacity they're just making a judgment on them based on their own paradigm how
[1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:29.760]  dangerous is that yeah it's it's unethical it's unprofessional right let's talk about you know
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:34.800]  obama is out there saying that it's he's very concerned he's he's watching uh donald trump
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:40.560]  and the house republicans with this a restructuring of obama care and we're gonna talk about that i
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:45.600]  think they have made some good strides in it quite frankly um i'll i'll kind of tip my hand here and
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:52.560]  say that i want to see a real repeal i want to see the framework and i know that there's uh not
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:57.120]  support for that in the establishment republican party so at least we're moving in the right
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:47:02.400]  direction at least we're making some major movement in that respect by taking away the mandates
[1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:09.440]  taking away a trillion dollars worth of taxes and giving people incentives instead of beating them
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:13.520]  over the head with a stick and a mandate we're giving people tax credits and this is not a
[1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:20.560]  deduction understand a tax credit if you buy insurance and it's going to be a tax credit that
[1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:24.480]  is based on age and then they're also going to means test it as we pointed out before
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:29.920]  uh obama is saying his business is being deconstructed he didn't have a business
[1:47:29.920 --> 1:47:34.000]  he had a socialist model and we're going to look at what's happening in venezuela right now we need
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:39.680]  to call it venezuelan health care look at this article here armored car hits a crowd as venezuela
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:46.640]  riots leave over 300 injured this is what happens when you pretend that you're going to give people
[1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:51.680]  stuff for free it's incredible as i point out everybody is saying and we even have a GOP senator
[1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:57.680]  saying any change to the health care situation is going to have to pass the jimmy kimmel test
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:01.520]  that we're going to take care of little children look at that they got this is an armored car
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:07.040]  driving through the crowd going through a crowd holy smokes that's what it devolves into because
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:13.120]  it always when you look at communism it always devolves into that when you start stealing assets
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:17.840]  from people and just kicking the can down the road and this is basically what obama care is doing
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:21.280]  and we need to pull back from this we've got a lot of republicans who don't want to pull back from
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:26.240]  this and we got republican senators are saying it needs to pass the jimmy kimmel test as i pointed
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:34.640]  out before it this was a private charitable hospital in la that has a budget of 233 million
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:40.640]  dollars a year to provide care for poor children jimmy kimmel could have afforded to pay for that
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:48.400]  out of his pocket jimmy kimmel had insurance and so his child would not have been uncovered if it
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:53.600]  wasn't for obama care his child would not have had a pre-existing condition that was excluded that was
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:49:00.320]  the lie of jimmy kimmel but the true lie about all this is that the real pre-existing condition is
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:05.360]  socialism that's what we see in venezuela what is happening to the children in venezuela the
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:11.360]  children in venezuela are not getting even the most basic health care right they're not getting food
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:18.000]  because of their socialist policies you cannot run a country on social if you want more affordable
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.200]  health care then what you have to have is a market-based structure that will bring the
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:28.880]  cost down to the extent that the government subsidizes it we see that medical care goes up
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:35.360]  we see that tuition goes up at college universities at a very fast rate because it's subsidized they
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:40.880]  have no incentive to try to save money and eventually you run out of other people's money
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:45.840]  just like you're right now they're sweeping all this money out of fanny and freddy to pay for
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:50.800]  these subsidies and as mitch mccall pointed out he said well if your metric is getting universal
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:56.400]  coverage for everybody it's a failure because we still have tens of millions of people who don't
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:01.440]  have any health care coverage in spite of the fact that they are stealing there he is right there
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:07.920]  as a GOP senator saying it doesn't pass the jimmy kimmel test okay well we'll tell you about that
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:14.000]  jimmy the jimmy kimmel propaganda that he did the other day doesn't pass a sniff test and as I
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.320]  pointed out they they cannot the socialists cannot deliver on the goods they can't even deliver
[1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:23.520]  basic food to people in venezuela and you see those riots there's absolutely amazing you know leon
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:30.960]  when we were in china to adopt my daughter seeing that uh that armored car go through the crowd there
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:34.880]  in china there's so many people on the street it's kind of like the only thing i've ever seen like
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:40.720]  that before was uh going to new york city on st patrick's day and this armored car pulls up
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:46.480]  this crowded street it's like a parade it's just packed with people and a guy gets out with a loaded
[1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:51.600]  shotgun double barrel shotgun pointing it at the crowd and i said to my family let's get out of here
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:56.880]  this is insane load it down pointing at everybody to intimidate people it's like it's one person
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:01.200]  who says that it's going to go off this is absolutely insane and it's even worse in venezuela
[1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:05.280]  stay with us in these uncertain times it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:10.320]  food and boil water if your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open
[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:15.520]  fire then there's a much better way the minot man rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove

[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:28.080]  I just want to thank you for your support over our 30 hour broadcast we have sold out of
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:33.920]  supermail vitality we're about to sell out of survival x2 nascent iodine and about to sell
[1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:38.800]  out of dna force and of course it's a very expensive for us to produce dna force because of
[1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:46.960]  bio pqq a very rare very valuable ingredient in that you can look at the 175 clinical studies that
[1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:51.600]  support how effective that one particular ingredient is but of course that's not the only thing that's
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:57.680]  in dna force but that makes it very difficult for us to replace it so when it sells out it's out for
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:03.280]  a while and it's about to sell out again dna force we do have a lot of products that are still in

[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:41.120]  take advantage of that while the supplies last thank you so much for your support absolutely
[1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:45.520]  okay leon you've got a couple of uh this is a last segment that you're here with us just a
[1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:50.960]  little news blitz well uh there's an article i guess this is homeland security putting this out
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:57.680]  isis uh in their islamic state magazine they have published tutorials on vehicle knife and
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:02.240]  arson attacks in the past so we know in their past magazines they say this is the way that you can
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:07.040]  do these attacks and avoid any law enforcement figuring it out and just go ram trucks into
[1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:12.320]  people and we've seen that these jihadists have taken that on well now they've they're putting
[1:56:12.320 --> 1:56:19.600]  in their magazines use fake apartment and job listings in craigslist ads to lure hostages
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:26.720]  and then murder victims and so it's less about um they really just want to have as many assaults as
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:32.400]  humanly possible so this is i mean this is something that's pretty scary because we've
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:36.240]  we're seeing that they're going they're heating the call they're ramming the trucks into people
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:42.640]  they're using knife attacks rather than uh trying to detonate things or suicide bombs and things
[1:56:42.640 --> 1:56:47.440]  like that so this is interesting we already know people have to be very careful when they answer these
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:52.800]  craigslist ads or you want to go look and you know that we've seen women have had been murdered
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:57.200]  when they went to go pick up baby clothes off craigslist and someone would take their unborn
[1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:01.440]  child from them uh just really frightening things but now you're having to worry about
[1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:08.720]  isis as well so that's pretty scary and then ran paul is now said that he has requested info
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:13.680]  officially on whether obama surveilled him which we know that absolutely he's been under surveillance
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:18.800]  he's shakes the establishment he's not afraid to get out there but he has made now a formal request
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:24.640]  to see if he was indeed one of these americans that was inadvertently scooped up incidentally
[1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:30.800]  surveilled by the obama administration meanwhile we have huma abadine who the fbi knows
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:37.840]  did committed a crime she deserves a criminal investigation and he has been classified documents
[1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:45.040]  to her husband so we could print him out or um and she gets off because she didn't she didn't know
[1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:50.320]  she didn't mean to commit a crime i mean i didn't mean to drive speed officer you're talking about
[1:57:50.320 --> 1:57:56.400]  playing politics and saying you know what uh don't try this at home i know that hillary clinton
[1:57:56.400 --> 1:58:01.360]  committed multiple felonies and security violations i know that huma abadine did it but you know
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:06.160]  they're very well connected people in washington don't you try this and as a matter of fact they
[1:58:06.160 --> 1:58:12.320]  do send people after he made that disgusting statement talking about the double standard that
[1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:18.640]  he as fbi director upholds he ought to be impeached he ought to be put in jail he ought to be deposed
[1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:23.120]  this guy is worse than jagger hoover at least jagger hoover had the decency to lie to us
[1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:28.560]  about what he was doing james comey does it to our face you're disgrace comey you're
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:32.800]  absolute disgrace stay with us when we come back we're going to talk about more of this
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:38.800]  intel that was sought by the nsa on people and putting out unredacted names not just in the

[2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:34.320]  obama care but we're going to do it in the next segment we're going to take a look at the proposed
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:40.480]  changes what happens at this point we have some signals from the democrats they think they won
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:47.520]  they're taunting the republicans said oh wow na na na na hey hey goodbye well i'm not so sure about
[2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:54.240]  that we just had an election and they're in such denial that trump didn't win the election they
[2:00:54.240 --> 2:00:58.240]  think the republicans didn't win the election they think the russians rigged everything
[2:00:58.240 --> 2:01:05.040]  they're believing their own nonsense we have a majority of people in this country who want to
[2:01:05.040 --> 2:01:11.280]  see this gone and it is a win to even move in that direction we're going to talk about the
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:16.720]  the details of this and how far we have gone of course they have left the structure in place
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:22.000]  in many regards and we don't like that but it's a good beginning and at least they're getting
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.080]  some movement on that so we're going to talk about that when we come back we're also going to talk about
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:32.800]  uh the spying on americans let's talk about that now as a matter of fact we had and leon was talking
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:39.120]  about this uh rand paul wants to know uh what they collected on him and we have this article from
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:45.120]  circa president obama's team sought nsa intelligence on thousands of americans during the election
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:53.120]  they got thousands of intelligence reports with unredacted names of us residents during the 2016
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:59.520]  election understand this is political surveillance folks this is what makes this so insidious they
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:05.680]  are collecting information on us presidential candidates the nsa the national security agency
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:12.000]  this agency that was created by an executive order by president truman they don't even have a
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:18.640]  charter like the cia and it came out during the church committee hearings and during the pike
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:23.280]  house committee hearings they were looking at the nsa and the cia because they knew at the time
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:27.280]  that they were spying on americans in the 1970s this is when they had the hearing they had been
[2:02:27.280 --> 2:02:31.360]  spying on americans from the very beginning we were told we're going to create these spy agencies
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:35.360]  but don't worry they're going to be used abroad they're not going to be used on you so they had
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:40.320]  these hearings that's where you see the famous heart attack gun that they were passing around
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:44.160]  talking about their assassination attempts and of course there's some more news about that today i
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:48.960]  don't know if that's true or not nevertheless we do know the government does engage in assassinations
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:54.000]  that came out then but that was the salacious part that they focused on and they did that so that
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:58.640]  people wouldn't pay much attention to the fact that they were spying on americans but they were
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:02.960]  and so they said well we're going to create the foreign intelligence surveillance act that's going
[2:03:02.960 --> 2:03:08.560]  to prohibit you from surveilling american citizens unless they are engaged in activity with suspects
[2:03:08.560 --> 2:03:14.560]  abroad and they created a so-called court which is not a court at all it has a single judge
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:18.800]  and that's where they go to get their search warrants and they don't get a specific search
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:23.520]  warrant remember in the constitution there's this quaint little idea that you will go before
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:28.560]  judge and get a search warrant and you'll be specific about who you're looking at why you're
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:33.680]  looking at them where you're going to look what you expect to find and then the judge is supposed
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:38.560]  to protect your privacy and look at that and say okay i have enough reason all these different
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:44.240]  reasons and all these and i'll give you the ability to search for these particular things
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:49.120]  at this particular time and place on this particular person instead now they go to the
[2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:55.200]  so-called court that is part of the faiza act and they get a search warrant for mr mrs verizon
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:04:03.600]  and the secret court the star chamber court of one person one person puts out edicts that they say
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.080]  they are modifying our constitution as if there was anything left to the constitution but we're
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:12.480]  not allowed to know what these secret amendments to the constitution are this is the orwellian
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:17.360]  kafkesk world that they have created here but even when they were having the church and
[2:04:17.360 --> 2:04:22.320]  pike committee hearings when they called in the nsa they said would like to see your well it wasn't
[2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:26.400]  a charter but would like to see your executive order they create you and the head of the nsa said
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:31.520]  no i'm going to show it to you you're just the congress i work for the president as we saw michael
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:36.080]  hayden do so this is the arrogance of these people what they collect they collected intelligence
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:43.440]  on presidential candidates on members of congress on journalists on clergy on lawyers on federal
[2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:50.720]  judges on doctors and they did it as part of the election this is a political police state you have
[2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:54.800]  to understand where this is going to go they're going to come after the politicians first the
[2:04:54.800 --> 2:05:00.400]  politicians have the capability to stop this and expose this they will be the first ones up against
[2:05:00.400 --> 2:05:04.960]  the wall by this police state if they don't we all know that when the democratic party blamed
[2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:12.080]  hillary clinton's loss on the russians it was the biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever but it seems
[2:05:12.080 --> 2:05:18.080]  now the vice president of the democratic political firm global strategy group said that according to
[2:05:18.080 --> 2:05:25.840]  their analysis two-thirds of the voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the democratic party
[2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:32.800]  to vote for trump so 70 of the reason hillary clinton loss can be attributed to her failure to
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:39.440]  pick up these prior obama voters she claims to be part of the resistance but even antifa doesn't
[2:05:39.440 --> 2:05:46.720]  want her there have even been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020 rob snider
[2:05:46.720 --> 2:05:53.440]  recently tweeted at this point i believe a judge should grant america a restraining order against
[2:05:53.440 --> 2:05:59.680]  hillary clinton for stocking i'm millie weaver for more reports go to info wars.com

[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:11.040]  a stick and you start offering them carrots i think that's going to change things you know when
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:15.760]  people were being beaten with a stick of obama care they were demanding that it be repealed that
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:21.680]  it be ended in this mandate in these trillion dollars worth of taxes this is supposed to make
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:27.440]  things more affordable they put taxes on medical devices they put taxes on health insurance that
[2:09:27.440 --> 2:09:33.200]  doesn't make it more affordable it destroys things to tax them the democrats don't get it
[2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:37.680]  and you know they say well we've only got 17 percent support well i don't know that's going
[2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:43.360]  to really affect congress congress only has 17 percent support the latest real clear politics
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:49.920]  where they take averages of polls shows 18.9 percent support for congress in general and
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:57.520]  that ranges from 11 to 23 percent on the polls so there is no more support for congress as they are
[2:09:57.520 --> 2:10:03.200]  now than there is for obama care as they present it to people but we're going to take a look at it
[2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:09.360]  but of course joe biden who seems to be positioning himself to run in 2020 comes out says this was a
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:15.040]  day of shame and congress millions of americans will lose coverage it's up to the senate now
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:22.960]  hoping for courage to return okay they're it's not focused on making health care affordable
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:29.840]  it is focused on coverage and it was never they never had it they stole it we keep telling over
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:35.600]  and over again the way that they paid for these subsidies for people is to sweep it out of fanny
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:41.040]  and freddy they stole from investors you can't support something like eventually they're going
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:45.520]  to run out of the money from the fanny and freddy investors they run out of other people's money
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:49.680]  they can't have it when that happens and now we see that it's got to move to the senate what are
[2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:55.520]  they going to do in the senate it was passed by a very narrow margin in the house 217 to 213
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:11:02.080]  as they point out senate leaders now are saying well we don't know that we're really interested
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:06.080]  in doing this we've got our own bill that we're going to do and then it's going to come back as
[2:11:06.080 --> 2:11:12.320]  part of reconciliation and in one way that's good because as part of the reconciliation process
[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:19.280]  that immediately does not have to do the 60 vote test it only has to have 51 votes and they have
[2:11:19.280 --> 2:11:26.960]  52 republicans who could pass this on their own but they're going to have to agree to do something
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:31.360]  about it and there's some questions as to what they'll do anything about it we saw back in march
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:38.560]  we saw lindsay graham facing down a crowd after paul ryan's first attempt to do this if it really
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:43.840]  was an attempt failed and lindsay graham came back and there were he was being booed by the crowd
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:47.840]  and he says here's what i think should happen next i think president should reach out to democrats
[2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:53.520]  i'd reach out to democrats hey lindsay the democrats don't want anything changed with obama
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:12:00.160]  care they love taxes they love telling everybody what to do you have to understand and there were
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:04.640]  so many different things that were wrong with health care to start with even before obama
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:09.840]  started making it far worse 25 years ago when i was working with the lp and we were getting
[2:12:09.840 --> 2:12:15.840]  a slate of candidates to run in north carolina one of the candidates was a doctor and he explained
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:20.080]  something to me that i never knew about thing called certificate of need and you medical
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:24.880]  professionals professionals out there probably knew about this if you want to open a private
[2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:30.720]  hospital and competition to the government hospitals that are owned and subsidized by the
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:36.160]  counties and so forth if you want to do that or even if you have a private hospital or a practice
[2:12:36.160 --> 2:12:42.240]  and you wanted to add something like an mri machine at the time uh you had to get a certificate of
[2:12:42.240 --> 2:12:49.760]  need you had to apply to your competitor the government that was running the county hospitals
[2:12:49.760 --> 2:12:53.440]  and you had to say well i'd like to buy another x-ray machine or i'd like to buy this kind of
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:59.920]  machine or that i'd like to expand my hospital i would like to go into competition with you
[2:12:59.920 --> 2:13:05.200]  county hospital and they would say well i yeah you have to make a case that uh you're really needed
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:11.920]  because uh we don't want you going into competition with us and hillary clinton was telling everybody
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:16.240]  the time we've got to have a single payer because competition is making this too expensive no
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:21.200]  competition makes things less expensive all of us who've had a real business know that
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:26.080]  brock obama thinks that he's watching his business that he created eight years ago
[2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:32.640]  be dismantled before his eyes it wasn't a business it's not a business when you hold a gun to somebody's
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:39.600]  head and you force them to buy protection that's a racket that's what the mafia does to real
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:43.360]  business men they come into a neighborhood they come into a small italian neighborhood and they'd
[2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:48.400]  hold a gun to your head and say uh you need to pay us for insurance for protection insurance
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:53.680]  protection from what protection from me because i'm going to blow your head off if you don't give
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:59.360]  me money and everything that the government does is a protection racket so let's talk about some of
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:05.520]  the protection rackets that these people did here uh you know it's it's in a sense when you repeal
[2:14:05.520 --> 2:14:09.920]  some of this stuff again going back to experiences in north carolina one of the things that we talked
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:14.560]  about i thought well okay we we talked about getting rid of the income tax completely abolishing the
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:20.240]  income tax abolishing the irs that's where we want to go but let's come up with something that is
[2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:25.360]  along those lines and so we decided those of us who were putting together ads and putting together
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:31.680]  candidates uh we said let's do an ad we can run it on cable and we had a situation at the time
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:36.880]  that may still be the time situation in north carolina we had sales tax on everything including
[2:14:36.880 --> 2:14:44.000]  food and so we did a little commercial where we had a bag of groceries and we said the american
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:47.920]  revolution we had like some you know fife and drum corps music in the background so the american
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:53.200]  revolution was fought over three percent tax on t here in north carolina whatever the sales tax was
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:59.360]  at a time six seven eight percent i don't know we have a six percent tax on everything that you eat
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:05.520]  have you had enough vote for us we'll get rid of this just give them something give them something
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:09.520]  and you know the interesting thing was the democrats who owned that state of the time just
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:14.480]  took them 150 years getting republicans uh in a majority after reconstruction that's the other
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:18.960]  thing people don't want to talk about history you don't want to talk about why the democrats had a
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:25.200]  lock on the south for so long it was the horrible things that were done under reconstruction but
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:30.000]  let's not talk about that in the schools let's not ever talk about reconstruction let's keep that
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:34.160]  secret nevertheless they eventually did get republicans in there and they did cut taxes on
[2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:42.240]  things but um at the time the speaker of the house who was a democrat started talking he
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:46.320]  heard that and he started talking about how they were thinking about getting rid of the
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:50.560]  tax on food and so he thought oh that's good maybe we'll at least get something like that
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:55.600]  raise awareness of the public well we didn't win and the talk about getting rid of that tax
[2:15:55.600 --> 2:16:00.000]  evaporated they didn't do anything about that but let's look at some of the taxes that were
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:05.440]  appealed from obama care this is on the drudge report and this is from the americans for tax
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:10.640]  reform i believe as a site uh they had taxes they had the individual mandate tax you know you don't
[2:16:10.640 --> 2:16:16.560]  pay uh you don't buy this insurance from the people and the quantities and the things that they
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:21.360]  dictate to you then you're going to get taxed from the irs your employer will get taxed okay
[2:16:21.360 --> 2:16:26.160]  you had a tax on health savings account so if you're doing a responsible thing and trying to set
[2:16:26.160 --> 2:16:31.440]  money aside pay for emergencies they would tax it they would tax your flexible spending accounts
[2:16:31.440 --> 2:16:38.560]  they would tax the chronic care tax they would tax health insurance itself they had a surtax on
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:43.360]  investment income 3.8 percent and people talk about that but again they don't talk about the massive
[2:16:43.360 --> 2:16:49.680]  theft they call it a net asset sweep out of fanny and freddy taking all the money out of that and
[2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:53.760]  that's still being done that has not been repealed by the republicans or by donald trump they had
[2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:58.640]  a tax on medical devices because you know this is going to make health care more affordable
[2:16:58.640 --> 2:17:03.760]  so we do that by taxing health insurance by taxing medical devices by taxing prescription drugs
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:10.800]  by taxing retiree prescription drugs and coverage all together you told the stuff up it's about a
[2:17:10.800 --> 2:17:16.000]  trillion dollars worth of taxes so yes i would be happy to see the government cut a trillion
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:20.240]  dollars in taxes good for them i would like to see full repeal i would like to get rid of the
[2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:26.800]  income tax but if we can cut the tax rates i'm all for that as well so yes they still have
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:32.320]  the structure there and if we look at the different things that are being done we see the general
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:37.600]  pattern of things which you're not going to really find in the establishment coverage of this
[2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:42.800]  is that they're getting rid of the mandate they're repealing it they're saying yes so
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:49.120]  we're going to have the insurance companies do pre-existing conditions but if you let your
[2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:54.400]  coverage lapse for 63 days you've got to pay a 30 percent surcharge for a year things like that
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:18:00.400]  it's still not insurance don't call it insurance it is still some kind of an entitlement program
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:07.200]  they're trying to keep this thin veneer of marketplaces there but it is uh it's not but
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:13.040]  nevertheless they are moving this by taking away taxes on medical devices health insurance drug
[2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:19.440]  companies health insurance plans and so forth and so on and offering you a tax credit if you buy it so
[2:18:19.440 --> 2:18:25.120]  instead of forcing you to do this punishing you to do this they say if you will buy health insurance
[2:18:25.120 --> 2:18:29.680]  we're going to give you a tax credit understand not a deduction and here's the deal if they really
[2:18:29.680 --> 2:18:37.760]  wanted to help you to make to afford your health care they would have given you at least they would
[2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:43.200]  have taken away the restrictions that they have in terms of even taking a tax deduction first of all
[2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:46.560]  if you don't take the standard deduction you're not going to be able to deduct your medical expenses
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:52.480]  if you have a lot of medical expenses in a home mortgage then maybe you can get a a itemized deduction
[2:18:52.480 --> 2:18:56.000]  but then they're going to take away 10 percent of your adjusted gross income before you even get to
[2:18:56.000 --> 2:19:00.400]  deduct that then when you deduct that let's say that you're in a 30 percent tax bracket that means
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:06.080]  that if you had left a thousand dollars worth of medical expenses you're only going to get
[2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:11.760]  300 dollars of you know 300 of that so you know they're going to they keep cutting it cutting it
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:15.760]  cutting it if they really wanted you to be able to afford health care they would have let you pay
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:21.040]  for it before you send the taxes to them but instead they gave you more taxes they gave you
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:26.800]  more mandates they put taxes hidden taxes on medical devices and other things like that and drugs and
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:32.720]  insurance so they didn't want you to be able to afford taxes it was about controlling you making
[2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:39.040]  you dependent upon the government and at least in this basic format looking not knowing all the
[2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:45.360]  details and not knowing what the Senate is going to do at least what you have now is a tax credit
[2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:49.440]  of two thousand dollars if you're very young if you're older four thousand dollars because your
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:55.040]  rates are going to be high that's a credit the bottom line that's a dollar for dollar deduction

[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:38.320]  as a thanks but we are also running out of stock we have run out of supermail vitality or about to
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:44.640]  run out of x2 and dna force but we still have things like brain force heavily discounted 30
[2:24:44.640 --> 2:24:51.600]  percent off uh pro pure filters 30 off so take a look at the sales that are there we do have
[2:24:51.600 --> 2:24:57.280]  some items many items that are that are still available some items are about to sell out
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:03.520]  supermail has sold out but we've extended that sale there's many items on that list from 20
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:08.800]  to 30 plus percent off discount that has been extended throughout the weekend
[2:25:08.800 --> 2:25:15.760]  i want to play for you a clip a highlight of the 30 hour broadcast we had with alex jones
[2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:20.560]  and ron paul and we were just talking before about his son rand paul saying i want to know
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:25.440]  if i'm one of the people that you've been collecting information on because they relaxed
[2:25:25.440 --> 2:25:29.360]  obama relax the rules for the nsa and of course they had thousands of people
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:34.080]  who are involved in politics people who are journalists and others and this is politically
[2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:38.080]  based folks you have to understand this i got something that i thought was kind of funny
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:43.040]  uh from charlie skelton his reporter that covers bill deberg for the guardian and i met him in
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:47.040]  bill deberg and i'll read that to you when we come back later but let's play this
[2:25:47.040 --> 2:25:58.080]  uh clip here of alex jones and ron paul let me bring this up to you i don't know if you saw it
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:03.200]  but it was in national news um i got the secret documents through mike sernovich that google was
[2:26:03.200 --> 2:26:09.360]  spending millions of dollars to delist info wars and they listed because i played clips of ron paul
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:14.640]  saying this is probably a false flag in syria and because i played putin and because i played
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:21.280]  some army kernels and they said this is an example of fake news so delist alex jones uh and have an
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:25.520]  army of trolls go out and start voting him down now because we published the document two days
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:30.320]  later they said okay rogue contractors did that we're going to stop now but it wasn't because
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:36.640]  you were fake news they admitted in 2013 2016 that the rebels got caught launching fake attacks
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:41.520]  we had this rush to judgment the british ambassador says it's clearly the rebels it sets a precedent
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:46.080]  with the rebels can stage events and then we rush to judgment uh your son helped lead the move in
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:51.600]  the senate to not have a rush to judgment in 2013 and be al-qaeda slash isis is there for us so we've
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:56.240]  now gotten to the point where i have a member of the federal reserve board of new york suing me
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:01.360]  i've been told shut up i have george soros's firm suing me i have dr corey c breaking that
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:06.720]  obama looted 300 billion out of fanny may freddy mac for obama care i've been told shut up about
[2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:11.520]  that or we'll destroy you uh so so that's the type of stuff the type of messages that i've got now i
[2:27:11.520 --> 2:27:16.320]  know as a congressman you probably got threats too but i've never had it at this level what do you
[2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:22.720]  make of that and why do you think uh they were so scared of me they listed playing ron paul clips
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:29.600]  well they're protecting the uh the the state and they're protecting the deep state as well
[2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:37.440]  uh if you two individuals that went to prison uh that were in congress uh for for for one major
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:42.000]  reason they were both very very strong anti irs and wrote books against and i think that was their
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:48.480]  major problem and and the same the same way they uh they what we have developed here is sort of a
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:54.720]  fascist system you know uh the government doesn't own google and all this social media but they have
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:27:59.600]  a they have control over it and they've sold out to the government because they're collecting all the
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:04.480]  information and oh the government doesn't collect this but if we need it google will give it to us
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:09.440]  and all these ordinary facebook they'll give it to them because they're exempt from any liability
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:14.640]  the congress gave them the exemption that they can you can't go in this if if somebody in social
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:19.840]  media has turned over your information they're not liable but the congress gave them that so it's
[2:28:19.840 --> 2:28:25.440]  a mixture of big business and big government and uh it's a it's a terrible thing and there's big
[2:28:25.440 --> 2:28:31.040]  money involved that has nothing to do with helping the poor people or helping the middle class get
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:36.800]  medical care uh it's uh it's power and it's control and it's the protection of the state and that's
[2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:42.640]  why whistleblowers are the greatest enemies of this you know truth becomes treason when you have
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:48.080]  an empire we have an empire so anybody who tells the truth and it would be in relative levels
[2:28:48.080 --> 2:28:53.600]  they're going to go after those individuals so uh that's what we're up against i when i left the
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:59.520]  congress this past time uh i listed some of the concerns and my number one concern was the destruction
[2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:06.560]  of the first amendment to speak out believing sincerely if you and i still have the uh privileged
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:12.400]  the right to speak out without the government coming down on us that we could change the system
[2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:19.360]  because ideas have consequences and they're more powerful than armies but uh they are and our enemies
[2:29:19.360 --> 2:29:25.600]  the opposition understands this because if we can silence people uh you know we can silence those
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:34.480]  ideas i don't think they can ideas can't be so we know that so i think i think the idea ideology
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:40.000]  is where the battle has to be not with what trump is going to do tomorrow i agree let me just say
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:44.160]  this in closing i am very honored to be demonized like you have been over the years i'm very honored
[2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:56.960]  to join that exclusive club we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[2:29:56.960 --> 2:30:07.680]  network we all know that when the democratic party blamed hillary clinton's loss on the russians it
[2:30:07.680 --> 2:30:14.320]  was the biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever but it seems now the vice president of the democratic
[2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:20.560]  political firm global strategy group said that according to their analysis two thirds of the
[2:30:20.560 --> 2:30:28.400]  voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the democratic party to vote for trump so 70 percent
[2:30:28.400 --> 2:30:34.640]  of the reason hillary clinton loss can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior obama
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:40.800]  voters she claims to be part of the resistance but even antifa doesn't want her there have even
[2:30:40.800 --> 2:30:48.320]  been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020 rob snider recently tweeted at this
[2:30:48.320 --> 2:30:55.040]  point i believe a judge should grant america a restraining order against hillary clinton for
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:31:04.000]  stalking i'm millie weaver for more reports go to info wars dot com the reason info wars life has five

[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:33.120]  well-meaning openness and our tolerance to get us to hate our species and give up on our life force
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:38.800]  and the attacks calling us fake news by the fake news that's seen in others really show how sick

[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:45.360]  here's a bunch of people and he makes the decisions but clearly course changed is that because the
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:49.760]  whole government was just blocking in both parties he couldn't get people in there was a government
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:54.000]  revolt we know the deep state did that that's admitted uh and then now he's having to compromise
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:57.840]  is that's what's happening because i still see a lot of good he's doing but you can see now that
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:03.600]  it's not a purist movement i think he's being willfully misled alex here's what i know i've
[2:41:03.600 --> 2:41:10.480]  known down from for almost 40 years and when he has all the information he almost invariably makes
[2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:16.240]  the right decision it is only when he does not have all the information or the information that
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:23.680]  he's been given has been colored or altered or manipulated to give him a false impression
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:31.680]  that mistakes are made we know for a fact that every single one of his advisors urged him to send
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:38.240]  150 000 ground troops boots on the ground in syria unfortunately there was one man in the
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:43.680]  white house who didn't like that idea one man who said no that's that terrible public policy no we're
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:51.200]  not doing that that man was donald j trump so my confidence continues to be with the president
[2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:57.680]  and my opposition is to those who mislead him i picked up today's new york times today to read
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:42:06.480]  about avonka trump's agenda for the next four years avonka had an agenda who knew i saw her at
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:12.560]  the convention i thought she was terrific i like her i think she is terrific but now suddenly she's
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:22.000]  unveiling an agenda who voted for avonka trump who voted for jared kuschner who voted for any of
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:30.880]  these globalists and then we have news today that richard grinnell who no one uh i think fought
[2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:38.000]  harder and more effectively for donald trump grinnell a former diplomat under the bush administration
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:44.240]  but a guy who's come full circle who understands the danger of the globalists who has renounced
[2:42:44.240 --> 2:42:52.080]  the new world order uh he's openly gay he was one of the most effective surrogates for donald
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:58.800]  trump it was announced that he was the president's choice to be nato ambassador it would have been a
[2:42:58.800 --> 2:43:08.240]  superb nomination we learned today that he that appointment has been mixed by rex tillerson and
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:13.840]  i am told that it is because he objects to the fact that grinnell despite the fact that he is
[2:43:13.840 --> 2:43:20.080]  learned and distinguished and experienced is openly gay now that's not what i voted for
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:27.440]  not me i'm a libertarian i don't care about your sexual orientation i care about your philosophy
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:33.920]  and your experience in your qualifications this is very disappointing and making it even worse
[2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:41.440]  alex says the people surrounding secretary tillerson they're never trumpers the people
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:50.400]  tell you they can't hire grinnell a trump loyalist they're never trumpers this uh is a real blow
[2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:56.960]  to those who understand loyalty to those who understand the quality and the character of
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:05.920]  rex for now a man who has earned this job in my opinion all right that was an excerpt from our
[2:44:05.920 --> 2:44:10.560]  30 hour mega broadcast that was alex jones talking to roger stone roger is going to be taking over
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:14.720]  the broadcast for the fourth hour i want to go back to what i was talking about earlier in the hour
[2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:21.440]  about the surveillance that is now being released and of course we see this news coming out all
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:26.560]  the time are people getting inoculated against this we've had some war we could leaks documents
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:33.600]  coming out talking about today our comedies is the latest uh group of revelations that we've seen
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:38.880]  from wiki leaks is a tool used by the cia to attack a computer inside a local area network
[2:44:39.520 --> 2:44:43.360]  typically what you would have in your office for example allows redirecting of traffic from the
[2:44:43.360 --> 2:44:49.440]  target computer inside the land through a computer infected with the malware controlled by the cia
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:55.680]  this technique is used by the cia to redirect the target's computer's web browser to an exploitation
[2:44:55.680 --> 2:45:00.240]  server while appearing to be a normal browsing session so it doesn't matter whether it's your
[2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:05.600]  television set that they're taking over turning on your samsung so they can watch and record
[2:45:05.600 --> 2:45:09.680]  everything that you're doing or whether they're hacking into your computers or looking at these
[2:45:10.400 --> 2:45:14.720]  these hacking tools that are being exposed by wiki leaks are people being anesthetized to this
[2:45:15.280 --> 2:45:21.120]  certainly the cia isn't the cia is not being anesthetized to this the cia is
[2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:25.760]  angry and embarrassed but i guess they don't realize that the american public in general
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:29.200]  doesn't seem to care that we have a government that is looking at everything that we're doing
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:33.440]  you ought to care and the politicians who can stop this even if the public doesn't know
[2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:39.040]  enough to care about where this is all headed the people who need to stop this or the politicians
[2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:42.880]  i haven't heard anybody complain about this except for rand paul and of course what he's
[2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:48.000]  complaining about is this newest revelation and it was on drudge earlier today about circa
[2:45:48.000 --> 2:45:55.040]  exposing the fact that we have thousands of intelligence reports with unredacted names
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:45:59.520]  remember when it was a big deal and it was a big deal that members of the trump administration
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:02.960]  they were passing around information that they'd collected on people and they said you didn't
[2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:09.440]  redact those names you are supposed to redact those names if you incidentally collect information
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:15.440]  on american citizens as part of your foreign spying that we authorized you to do if you
[2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:19.200]  incidentally collect information on people and they're not part of a criminal investigation
[2:46:19.200 --> 2:46:23.840]  you have an obligation to keep that information private they don't care they passed around
[2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:29.200]  unredacted names of course this is the obama administration the same people who were out
[2:46:29.200 --> 2:46:34.800]  there trying to silence anybody who disagrees with them with censorship and as they're talking
[2:46:34.800 --> 2:46:39.440]  about this they they're asking they reveal this they talk about the program the fact that there's
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:43.760]  thousands of names out there that were unredacted it was made available this week by the office
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:47.200]  of the director of national intelligence this isn't something that was put out there by a
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:51.760]  whistleblower this isn't something that was put out there by wiki leaks for example this is
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:57.120]  actually a positive sign i think in the sense that it was put out by the office of national
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:02.560]  intelligence because perhaps and i'm just trying to read between the lines and being as optimistic
[2:47:02.560 --> 2:47:09.200]  as i can perhaps people in the trump administration realize that this is now a tool of political
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:13.920]  oppression this is the way that our intelligence agency is being used we know that the irs is
[2:47:13.920 --> 2:47:18.800]  being used that way irs has been designed to be used that way and was used that way for decades
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:22.880]  it wasn't one of the charges against richard nixon was that he wanted to use the irs against his
[2:47:22.880 --> 2:47:29.040]  political enemies the problem was for richard nixon that the then director of the irs had
[2:47:29.040 --> 2:47:32.960]  enough integrity to tell people about it or maybe just didn't like richard nixon exposed in that way
[2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:37.840]  but maybe he was spying on people for the democrats but he didn't want to do it for the
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:41.920]  republicans i don't know but whatever he didn't do it he turned the list over it was one of the
[2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:49.680]  articles of impeachment but for obama the guy who's still there uh was engaging in political
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:54.160]  activity against tea party groups and so forth and so on and but they're still there the people
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:47:58.000]  who did it for obama they did it they got away with it obama did get impeached those people are
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:03.280]  still there and the trump administration for the most part obama loosened privacy protections they
[2:48:03.280 --> 2:48:10.160]  say and uh of course a court affirmed his order at the baloney court the faiza is nothing to do with
[2:48:10.160 --> 2:48:15.520]  a court the only court that it resembles is the star chamber court that we had the bill of rights
[2:48:15.520 --> 2:48:19.600]  and the magna card at a stop from ever happening again but nobody knows their history so they
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:23.840]  don't care they allow this kind of stuff to happen and you have to understand that this is purely
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:31.360]  political when they're doing this too as i point out journalists clergy lawyers federal judge doctors
[2:48:31.360 --> 2:48:38.240]  presidential candidates and members of congress like ran paul it's political folks we all know
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:43.040]  that it's there and it has to be stopped and so they're asking uh this news organization that put
[2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:47.120]  these couple of articles out they're asking president trump to declassify this data to put
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:52.080]  this out there ran paul has asked for this as well we need to expose this so that we can stop it
[2:48:53.360 --> 2:48:57.920]  it's it's almost kind of a joke you know i i alluded to this earlier i got a uh communication
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:01.840]  from uh charlie skelton he's a reporter for the guardian i met him at uh bill deberg a couple
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:06.560]  of years ago my wife and i met him and so he said a nice note and then he put it the end of it
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:10.880]  then he's kind of a comedian actually he was a comedian for a while i realized it's a bit weird
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:15.280]  to say hi like this in a medium that's pathetically transparent to government and other surveillance
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:21.360]  but hey what can you do and to the people who are reading this really you need to get a life
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:25.840]  i'm just saying hello to a fellow journalist i met in copenhagen a couple of years ago and for
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:30.000]  what it's worth info wars isn't the problem but you already know that don't you you're just doing
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:36.320]  your job you got a sign to do this i know i know the thing is when you joined up is this what you
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:41.840]  imagined your job would be snooping in on private communications between two law fighting gentlemen
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:47.600]  it's not too late to quit you can become an artist a potter you can open a burger joint you know you
[2:49:47.600 --> 2:49:53.360]  got a flare with food your town needs a boutique burger restaurant come on follow your dreams i
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:57.920]  do stuff like that to my wife i'll talk to her and then i'll say i'll leave a little note there to
[2:49:57.920 --> 2:50:03.200]  the nsa or whoever whatever government government snoop is listening to that had alex has done
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:08.880]  stuff like that to me when he sent me messages we know you're listening we're journalists we cover
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:13.280]  these we're paying attention we're trying to get the american public to know that you're
[2:50:13.280 --> 2:50:17.520]  listening to us we're trying to get the american public to pay attention and we're trying to get
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:24.960]  the politicians to pay attention because as donald trump hopefully knows by now this is a political
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:31.120]  weapon this is a weapon to be used against the populace but it will be used first and foremost
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:37.360]  as we've always said against the politicians they will be the ones up against the wall first the
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:43.680]  people who have the power to change this the current congress the current president are the
[2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:49.200]  ones that are going to be the victims of this if they don't do it they need to do it for everybody
[2:50:49.200 --> 2:50:54.880]  you've seen it used against yourself you need to do this for yourself for everyone in america stand
[2:50:54.880 --> 2:50:58.000]  up for the bill of rights stand up for our privacy stay with us we'll be right back

[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:12.480]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night in the next segment we're going to be joined by
[2:54:12.480 --> 2:54:17.680]  roger stone he'll be doing the fourth hour for us today i'll take a look at where this change in
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:23.280]  obama care is headed after it passed the house of course donald trump has signaled his intention
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:30.240]  to sign it but the the hitch here is in the senate and as i said before i want to see this whole
[2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:34.400]  structure this framework of mandates taken down but i think they've made some good steps in that
[2:54:34.400 --> 2:54:41.440]  direction and like i said i want to see the income tax abolished but i would also applaud if somebody
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:50.080]  cuts the tax rates significantly so we have to be willing to take the changes as we can get them
[2:54:50.080 --> 2:54:55.360]  and continue to talk about where we really need to be and understand as i pointed out before
[2:54:55.360 --> 2:55:00.160]  that there's so many things like certificates of need that the government had put in place even
[2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:04.720]  before they got involved directly in health care with mandates with additional taxes you know to
[2:55:04.720 --> 2:55:08.560]  make it more affordable you know it always makes things more affordable when you put heavy taxes
[2:55:08.560 --> 2:55:14.320]  on it right that's the logic of the democrats so let's take those taxes off let's try to make a few
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:22.400]  moves towards a uh an open marketplace let's take away the powers of the hhs dictator we don't need a
[2:55:22.400 --> 2:55:26.720]  health czar in washington that's one of the things that's still there that really concerns me they're
[2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:32.480]  looking at that as a tool of reform but that's that's a very dangerous thing that's like boormir
[2:55:32.480 --> 2:55:35.680]  putting on the ring of power in the lord of the rings and thinking that's going to work out but
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:41.040]  let's take a look at what the senate is going to do now we've got uh article from politico saying
[2:55:41.040 --> 2:55:47.760]  the senate jp is rejecting the house obama care bill as uh we see from lindsay graham he says
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:54.400]  like y'all i'm still waiting to see if it's a boy or girl yeah lindsay we know we're still waiting
[2:55:54.400 --> 2:56:00.560]  to find out what you are or let us know when you make up your mind anyway uh we have another quote
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:08.400]  from bob corker who says i turned the volume off some time ago and i have no idea what the house
[2:56:08.400 --> 2:56:13.520]  is passing he really doesn't care and we know all about bob corker we've had Jerome course he talked
[2:56:13.520 --> 2:56:19.120]  about the way that this is funded stealing from investors and he did an article specifically
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:25.920]  about bob corker he did this back on april 19th he said a g.o.p senator gets rich blocking obama
[2:56:25.920 --> 2:56:31.280]  care repeals and he was talking about you bob corker and this is the same guy who says i have no
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:35.760]  idea what the house passed he says i turned off the volume a long time he just doesn't care he
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:40.400]  doesn't want it to pass he's making money off of this and uh that's the way it is with a lot of
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:44.800]  these people meanwhile we got another g.o.p senator and this is very important too because folks
[2:56:46.160 --> 2:56:52.880]  with a reconciliation process they can they need 51 votes there's only 52 republicans and if we got
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:57.680]  people like bob corker who's getting rich off of blocking obama care and if we got people like
[2:56:57.680 --> 2:57:04.320]  bill cassidy republican of louisiana saying the senate plan to repeal and replace obama care must
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:10.800]  pass the jimmy kimmel test does that mean it has to have a lot of bs added to it a lot of propaganda
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:15.120]  because that's what jimmy kimmel was doing and of course it's not just a g.o.p senator saying
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:19.360]  we got to have the jimmy kimmel test and of course he's referring to the fact that jimmy kimmel
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:25.280]  got on television carefully talked about the severe health issue the emergency open heart
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:32.320]  surgery that need to be performed on his newborn child and then tried to spin that into a case for
[2:57:32.320 --> 2:57:37.760]  obama care and of course obama jumped on that the next day obama turns jimmy kimmel's story about
[2:57:37.760 --> 2:57:44.960]  his 10 day old son's open heart surgery into an obama care plug yeah just getting on television
[2:57:44.960 --> 2:57:50.320]  this is this is where they are they have to get people that they can't win the narrative with
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:54.960]  facts and with debate so what they do is they get late night talk show comedians to push their
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:58:00.720]  agenda now people like cobear people like jimmy kimmel talking about the heart disease and
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:07.280]  the daily wire had a couple of good articles that came back some tweets and quotes from
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:14.480]  ben Shapiro who interestingly enough had a child he had a daughter who had to have the same
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:20.960]  surgery had it at the same hospital with the same doctor it was a private charity hospital
[2:58:20.960 --> 2:58:25.120]  that does pay for this if people don't have any insurance and if you had insurance it wouldn't
[2:58:25.120 --> 2:58:31.360]  have been excluded with a pre-existing condition they call total bs on what jimmy kimmel did but
[2:58:31.360 --> 2:58:35.440]  of course if you're in venezuela you can't even get food let alone open heart surgery that's where
[2:58:35.440 --> 2:58:42.400]  socialism leads stay with us roger stone is going to be joining us in the next hour thank you for

[3:01:10.240 --> 3:01:18.880]  alternative news organizations this is perhaps the greatest challenge that we face it is a
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:27.760]  fundamental fight over free speech and a free press a free press is crucial for the survival
[3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:34.240]  of our democracy joining us later on the show we have jacob engels the editor and publisher

[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:32.240]  sites down and put us out of business you see they would like to return to the days when abc
[3:02:32.240 --> 3:02:44.000]  and nbc and cbs and cnn and fox had an absolute stranglehold indeed a monopoly on political
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:50.800]  dissemination in this country if it didn't happen there it didn't happen but the technological
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:57.680]  advances of millions of americans now getting their political news from a handheld computer device

[3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:14.240]  biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever but it seems now the vice president of the democratic
[3:05:14.240 --> 3:05:20.480]  political firm global strategy group said that according to their analysis two-thirds of the
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:28.480]  voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the democratic party to vote for trump so 70% of
[3:05:28.480 --> 3:05:35.280]  the reason hillary clinton loss can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior obama voters
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:40.800]  she claims to be part of the resistance but even antifa doesn't want her there have even
[3:05:40.800 --> 3:05:48.320]  been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020 rob snider recently tweeted at this

[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:38.800]  here some breaking news uh as the washington post reported only minutes ago uh i have been
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:46.240]  contacted uh along with uh paul manifold general mike flinn and this fellow carter page who i
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:52.880]  don't know uh and we have been contacted by both the u.s senate and the house intelligence committees
[3:08:52.880 --> 3:09:02.880]  uh who appear to be prepared to negotiate the conditions for public testimony on the bogus
[3:09:02.880 --> 3:09:10.800]  question of russian interference in american elections and collusion between the trump campaign
[3:09:10.800 --> 3:09:19.040]  and the russian state let me say again for those of you who are just tuning in i am anxious indeed
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:28.320]  ready to testify in public senators feinstein and warner and franken have specifically lied
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:36.880]  about me but they seem to be confused yesterday senator feinstein repeated the canard that i
[3:09:36.880 --> 3:09:45.200]  knew about the hacking of john pedestas email in advance she repeated the lie that i had advanced
[3:09:45.200 --> 3:09:53.040]  notice of the contents of wikileaks disclosures against hillary and then hours later she gave
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:59.600]  an interview on cnn in which she admitted that there was no evidence whatsoever of russian
[3:09:59.600 --> 3:10:07.280]  collusion with the trump campaign so senator feinstein i know you're in um what your 80th term
[3:10:07.280 --> 3:10:15.120]  and perhaps you're slipping but which is it either there is evidence or there is not you see
[3:10:15.120 --> 3:10:23.840]  words matter senator and your words matter in any event we'll keep you updated on that i have
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:33.520]  requested no immunity i only require that my testimony be in public and i am anxious to take
[3:10:33.520 --> 3:10:43.440]  those senators on and take their exact words and parse them in a search for the truth now joining
[3:10:43.440 --> 3:10:51.840]  us is my colleague jake jake of angles of the central florida post which is a fledging libertarian
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:11:00.000]  oriented news site jake of angles welcome to info wars dot com and the alex joneshow thank you so
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.920]  much for having me on roger i try and support info wars as much as i can and it's great to be here
[3:11:05.920 --> 3:11:14.960]  as a guest so um jake up you have been really out there in the last couple weeks you've broken some
[3:11:14.960 --> 3:11:22.320]  major stories uh but what we're going to focus on today is not just the incredible stories you
[3:11:22.320 --> 3:11:31.440]  have broken but how immediately in the aftermath of those journalistic breakthroughs facebook google
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:39.520]  and the other internet giants have moved swiftly to snuff you to cut off your public access to
[3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:46.320]  bury the stories let's start with roland's college walk us through what you learned there
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:51.600]  and then what happened to you once you posted the fruits of your investigative journalism
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:59.840]  sure so at roland's college we had a radical islamic professor who proclaimed in class that the
[3:11:59.840 --> 3:12:06.320]  crucifixion was a hoax that uh jesus's disciples did not believe that he was divine in any event a
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:11.280]  christian student stood up to that professor she then issued a revenge grade and started a whole
[3:12:11.280 --> 3:12:16.320]  series of events which resulted in the student suspension her filing a false police report
[3:12:17.040 --> 3:12:22.320]  and that's ultimately what we reported on and as soon as we started to report on that the mainstream
[3:12:22.320 --> 3:12:28.480]  media the people who love to run around and say fake news about everything they don't like or agree
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:35.360]  with started labeling us fake news first the orlando sentinel then snopes then we saw a lot of
[3:12:35.360 --> 3:12:41.360]  media matters trolls and other people that have attacked info wars and stone cold truth and immediately
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:47.520]  our content started to disappear from the top top search results uh while we were having more shares
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:52.160]  than any other content so that's what happened at roland's college and it's still developing
[3:12:52.160 --> 3:13:00.240]  we're investigating protester but google facebook the mainstream media the globalist uh controllers
[3:13:00.240 --> 3:13:06.160]  who want to censor information took a shot at us on a local level so it's it's happening all across
[3:13:06.160 --> 3:13:14.800]  the board now incredibly you also broke up major story regarding george soros and as i recall it
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:22.960]  pertained to his funding of a local florida prosecutor who seems to be doing his dirty work and then
[3:13:22.960 --> 3:13:29.360]  what really amazed me is in the immediate aftermath of your breaking this carefully documented story
[3:13:30.160 --> 3:13:37.360]  you were threatened by soros's thugs yourself directly usually they kind of hide behind others
[3:13:37.360 --> 3:13:44.880]  their front organization of monkeys that media matters for america a a criminal enterprise
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:51.440]  which um whose finances should be examined for their tax cheating uh and their violation of
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:59.680]  their nonprofit status to do hardcore political work uh believe me if the shure on the other foot
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:06.960]  if media matters were a conservative or a pro-liberty organization the irs would be on them like a
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:14.720]  cheap suit but in this case uh lay out for us what you learned how you reported it
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:21.040]  and then what the results were so george soros funded this state attorney norton osceola county
[3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:26.640]  to the tune of 1.3 million dollars in the 2016 election she wins and then all of a sudden she
[3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:32.240]  announces that she's going to be anti-death penalty she's not going to charge death penalty
[3:14:32.240 --> 3:14:38.400]  and that's when we started investigating we found that soros uh had not stopped supporting her
[3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:45.120]  when the election ended but in fact funded a group that helped her expel and husband get a job
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:50.560]  funded a group that is providing the talking points to the state attorney for free and a very
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:57.440]  expensive service uh and company telling her how to skirt the issue about death penalty how to
[3:14:57.440 --> 3:15:03.040]  talk to the media so we exposed all of this and connected the dots and put it in a very clear
[3:15:03.040 --> 3:15:10.720]  timeline and to my surprise i began getting emails from george soros's pr people demanding it be taken
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:17.520]  down you will take this down you will issue a retraction and i said no you can answer a few
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:22.800]  questions or mr soros can submit not bad and that's that's how we're going to do it and they kept
[3:15:22.800 --> 3:15:29.120]  demanding demanding demanding and i finally got fed up with it i did a live video on facebook
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:33.840]  and said we will not retract we will not take it down because if you let him bully and if you let
[3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:39.040]  him do this to me just like when they're doing trying to do it to you to alex jones to a whole
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:45.600]  info wars audience we cannot let them do it because if they get one opportunity they're
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:51.840]  just going to keep going and going and going you know this is a really amazing to me the
[3:15:51.840 --> 3:16:00.560]  jacob's how old are you 25 so here you have a libertarian independent investigative journalist
[3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:08.400]  whose website the central florida post previously known as the east orlando post is a powerhouse
[3:16:08.400 --> 3:16:13.840]  and who over the last several years have broken some of the major stories in florida politics and
[3:16:13.840 --> 3:16:21.760]  now suddenly you have drawn the ire of george soros who instead of hiding behind one of his
[3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:31.440]  thugs is actually in this case threatening you directly this is a this is a what i would say
[3:16:31.440 --> 3:16:38.560]  a perfect case study of what we're up against this is why i have worked with others to form

[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:33.680]  or we will put together a class action suit by far a more expensive and difficult route but
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:40.560]  one we will pursue if that is what it takes but more importantly to educate the american people
[3:17:41.120 --> 3:17:48.800]  so that individual voters and individual viewers go to their congressmen go to their senators
[3:17:48.800 --> 3:17:55.600]  go to the white house with their messages to let them know that we are not going to stand

[3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:24.560]  welcome back to info wars dot com in the alex jones show i'm roger stone sitting in for my friend
[3:24:24.560 --> 3:24:32.800]  alex jones and our subject today our focus is internet censorship and the stranglehold that
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:40.560]  the tech giants are attempting to reassert unfree expression in this country now we have obtained
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:48.080]  the twitter shadow ban list for the time being this is only a partial list of the most notorious
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:56.240]  accounts that are being monitored on a daily basis and whose algorithms are being manipulated
[3:24:56.240 --> 3:25:04.560]  to limit our reach our reposts and our retweets the list appears to have been created more through
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:12.320]  an algorithm process using filters rather than using buzzwords and if a person on the list is
[3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:18.560]  low priority it will take 15 to 20 seconds once it runs through the programmed buzzwords
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:26.960]  and the person the twitter twitter is blocked if it's a high profile it may acquire manual
[3:25:27.520 --> 3:25:34.560]  approval from the national board of censors but the impressions are reduced with a limited
[3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:42.160]  capacity which is why you are seeing less and less likes and retweets from conservative accounts
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:48.480]  because limiting impression means less people seeing your tweets from their accounts in their
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:57.120]  regular news feeds wiki leaks and goose fur 2.0 are ironically not on the list but let's look at
[3:25:57.120 --> 3:26:06.720]  who is wanita broadrick the woman brutally raped by bill clinton she is among those who are shadow
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:14.720]  banned the actor john void an outspoken supporter of donald trump and the republican party banned
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:28.480]  info wars.com banned prison planet banned stone cold truth banned the stone zone banned roger j
[3:26:28.480 --> 3:26:42.880]  stone jr banned stefan malin you banned veritas banned james o'keith the third banned dr jaron
[3:26:42.880 --> 3:26:58.240]  coursey banned mike cernovich banned lionel media banned millie weaver banned joe rogan banned info
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:12.400]  wars reports banned info wars insider banned leon macadoo banned this is incredible folks this is
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:21.120]  this is a hit list for those who are out there telling the truth this is extraordinary steve
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:32.640]  pacinic joe farrah banned this takes away my breath it is extraordinary that anybody would be so
[3:27:32.640 --> 3:27:42.560]  brazen as to seek to end the free expression rights that we are our have used to open up political
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:49.680]  discourse and indeed to elect a donald trump jacob angles is still with us jacob so what do you make
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:57.760]  of this incredible list is it really shouldn't be a surprise they have been targeting the people
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:03.520]  who are on the front lines of the info war for a long time now i think now we can actually see
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:09.760]  this official list and understand it and it's going to become harder and harder to tell the truth
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:16.400]  and to share what is really going on and that's why it's so important i know we've talked about
[3:28:16.400 --> 3:28:22.960]  several times what people can do to support the info war i have broken a lot of stories taken on
[3:28:22.960 --> 3:28:29.760]  the establishment and i really firmly believe that without brain force plus i would not have
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:35.120]  been able to do that these stories these activities take so much out of you and it becomes harder
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:41.600]  to tell the truth and disseminate what is really happening you know that roger alex knows that everyone
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:46.480]  in info wars knows that so everyone that is listening that is upset about who is being banned
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:54.320]  and who is being taken down by the censorship police do your part go to info war store and
[3:28:54.320 --> 3:28:59.120]  buy something you know we don't all have a million dollars but whatever you can do to support the
[3:28:59.120 --> 3:29:04.960]  info war we have to do it well you're right about you're right about that jacob and let me say also
[3:29:04.960 --> 3:29:10.720]  anybody with a facebook feed anybody with a twitter feed if you're on instagram or snapshot

[3:30:02.320 --> 3:30:08.160]  we all know that when the democratic party blamed hillary clinton's loss on the russians it was the
[3:30:08.160 --> 3:30:14.320]  biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever but it seems now the vice president of the democratic
[3:30:14.320 --> 3:30:20.560]  political firm global strategy group said that according to their analysis two thirds of the
[3:30:20.560 --> 3:30:28.560]  voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the democratic party to vote for trump so 70% of
[3:30:28.560 --> 3:30:35.360]  the reason hillary clinton loss can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior obama voters
[3:30:35.360 --> 3:30:40.880]  she claims to be part of the resistance but even antifa doesn't want her there have even
[3:30:40.880 --> 3:30:48.400]  been rumors circulating that she may try to run again in 2020 rob snider recently tweeted at this
[3:30:48.400 --> 3:30:54.720]  point i believe a judge should grant america a restraining order against hillary clinton

[3:33:28.480 --> 3:33:35.200]  and our focus today has been on internet censorship because as i said earlier i believe this is the
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:33:43.280]  greatest single fight that we face you see we cannot win the war against globalism the war
[3:33:43.280 --> 3:33:50.640]  over american sovereignty fights over immigration or trade or taxation or the soundness of our money
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:34:01.040]  if we do not have equal access to the internet the internet is the underlying vehicle for the
[3:34:01.040 --> 3:34:08.080]  revolution that elected donald trump and though now those on the left have realized the enormous
[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:15.680]  mistake that they have made they seek to put the toothpaste again back into the tube i am
[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:24.480]  continuing to review this list of those who are subject to twitter's shadow band and it continues
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:36.720]  to blow my mind jack basobiak of rebel media a zero hedge dc leaks mike savage and a savage nation
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:45.840]  all banned this is uh this is an abomination this is an affront to our civil liberties and our rights
[3:34:45.840 --> 3:34:54.560]  to a free expression when the government and their uh enormous grants for the left-wing
[3:34:54.560 --> 3:35:02.640]  organizations who are doing the actual blocking uh actually are so brazen as to put out of list of
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:13.920]  those who must be silenced well then we know that this fight is on despite the fact that
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:23.120]  donald trump took a punitive action in syria a direct front to the russians despite the fact
[3:35:23.760 --> 3:35:32.000]  that the president nixed what would have been a very lucrative deal for exxon in russia the
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:39.920]  mainstream media and their running dog lackeys like senator feinstein and warner and that never
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:49.760]  funny al franken as well as lightweight congressman like adam schiff a man who's so full of schiff his
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:57.920]  eyes are brown they continue to promulgate this russian lie confident in the fact that their
[3:35:57.920 --> 3:36:06.480]  allies on the tech left can kneecap us when we seek to respond with the truth you see how it
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:14.000]  works now they utilize the mainstream media principally cnn which is almost unwatchable
[3:36:14.720 --> 3:36:23.200]  wolf blitzer no wolf you're not a journalist you're a hack you're a flak you're a bs artist
[3:36:23.200 --> 3:36:30.640]  you're anything but a journalist uh and they continue to promulgate the big lie
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:40.640]  confident that patriots viewers americans have no place else to go in order to get the counter
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:52.160]  story it's ingenious except it's not going to work we are programmed here to try to examine
[3:36:52.160 --> 3:37:01.280]  the exact technologies that are being used to throttle us to shut us down you can call it
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:10.240]  shadow banning you can call it search filtering you can call it fake news flagging you can call it
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:19.920]  throttling and you can examine the ubiquitous use of these computer bots but they are all being
[3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:31.840]  utilized to kneecap us they're all being utilized to stop us from reaching you and they unfortunately
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:40.000]  have thanks to their government patronage the tech giants have become extraordinarily wealthy
[3:37:41.040 --> 3:37:47.760]  they have an unlimited war chest with which to wage their war for censorship
[3:37:47.760 --> 3:37:57.280]  we unfortunately have no such riches which is why we need to count on you to go to the info wars
[3:37:57.280 --> 3:38:03.040]  store dot com and pick up many of the fine products now there's one there that i'm particularly fond

[3:38:10.960 --> 3:38:20.880]  revolution this book details the role of info wars dot com as the point of the spear as the
[3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:28.000]  cutting edge of the new revolution and it speaks of the time when donald trump appeared on this
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:36.480]  very program and patriots across the country learned that donald trump was the anti globalist
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:42.960]  candidate that donald trump believed in american sovereignty american exceptionalism american
[3:38:42.960 --> 3:38:49.440]  strength and the trump candidacy got the imprimatur of alex jones himself

[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:55.120]  and they're in the news saying we decided he's a failure so we're going to remove the quote how
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:41:00.960]  darrell front could be fired as the headline uh when we put that article up on screen so everybody's
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:05.920]  got to get serious for the camp he's having to compromise they want to scold the government
[3:41:05.920 --> 3:41:10.800]  and say it was his fault he's having to compromise to put this around it only has a few friends
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:14.800]  even his administration and you notice in this article it says they're talking to people high
[3:41:14.800 --> 3:41:20.640]  level in his administration that have decided themselves he needs to go losing the money and
[3:41:20.640 --> 3:41:25.840]  you know the debt basically the use of lilias the sort of sorrows people i'm sorry it's back
[3:41:26.400 --> 3:41:30.480]  they're the ones that have cleaned house have always ruled the court the court has over-delivered
[3:41:31.280 --> 3:41:36.480]  106 days he's over-delivered uh ragan didn't get this one done in three years we've done a
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:41.600]  repetitive little bit was it maxi did four took ragan three and a half years to get there you know
[3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:47.200]  we on some days we're trying to scold the economy but even the he uses spot market strong back up
[3:41:47.200 --> 3:41:52.960]  on the exuberance of the trump effect so again trump's not perfect folks but he's doing out of
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:58.160]  the storm he has the globalist backing him because he's the president now he's bringing
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:03.200]  power back to the executive back to the legislator back to the judicial and then back to the state
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:07.920]  we have to bring the swamp on our lives on every level down in the state federal international
[3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:12.880]  he's talking to you in front of our house these are the illegals coming in down forty three percent
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:17.680]  and just the first hundred days that's all confirmed and that's why they're panicking if he was selling
[3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:23.840]  out they wouldn't be openly trying to sell the idea of positive government martial law and floating
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:28.560]  it down in extreme news as if it's something to deal so i told people this three months ago
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:34.400]  i saw the movements now he's committed how they're on c and in saying that i hope isis blows them
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:39.840]  you know where he lives somebody gets arrested they're saying go out for me kill me kill stone
[3:42:39.840 --> 3:42:45.040]  tells the hitler colonia they're trying to destroy my family openly uh they're they are coming out
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:49.280]  for anybody they think there's an account word who will rally the american people against this
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:53.520]  global charity we have a great chance of winning but all of you guys spread the word and you pass
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:42:59.040]  the twitter you've got a hand to spread our links on twitter on facebook on google start your own
[3:42:59.040 --> 3:43:05.200]  websites not the final word don't start your own site close to expand call phone radio info wars.com
[3:43:05.200 --> 3:43:09.680]  is the forbidden site because it's the clearing house for all these great times so if they're
[3:43:09.680 --> 3:43:14.480]  openly in the news only one rocker in the seven of those guests i'm gonna get off here rocker but
[3:43:15.200 --> 3:43:21.120]  ladies and gentlemen they are moving up to everyone because they're kicking their ass our ideology
[3:43:21.120 --> 3:43:26.240]  pure success true amount of time they can't deal with it and club is like a lion with a hundred
[3:43:26.240 --> 3:43:31.600]  hyenas at him right now but some of us are bitching to shouldn't know this better i'm sorry we do a
[3:43:31.600 --> 3:43:37.600]  lot of right now but well the purpose for real going by is going to play for us we're going to
[3:43:37.600 --> 3:43:41.040]  get through the big ol impact or i'll just go on the level that's what i think i'll be talking about
[3:43:41.040 --> 3:43:48.320]  the study quarter 15 of central lord willing you know alex this is such incredibly important
[3:43:48.320 --> 3:43:53.920]  breaking news i'm going to ask our guest dr franklin brothers to come back and join us next week
[3:43:53.920 --> 3:44:00.000]  and we can continue the discussion of the censorship campaign because what you've just put on the table
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:08.320]  must be addressed i first sense that there would be a future move to remove trump when i was watching
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:16.640]  the cabinet selections as you know under the 25th amendment if a majority of the cabinet
[3:44:16.640 --> 3:44:26.560]  and the vice president decide that the president is incapacitated cannot fulfill the duties of
[3:44:26.560 --> 3:44:36.880]  his office that he is removed now he can challenge that decision but it would go to a vote of the
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:48.000]  us house controlled by paul ryan despite paul ryan's success in repealing obama care i don't
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:56.400]  think anyone on the anti-globalist right considers him anything but a quisling a spy in our midst
[3:44:57.120 --> 3:45:05.040]  after all he was mit romney's running mate for vice president and mit romney did a superb job
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:12.240]  of offering the american people the exact same thing that barack obama offered them an election
[3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:21.360]  of no choice my conscience is clear i voted for governor gary johnson this was four years ago
[3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:28.400]  so i think cabinet members in some cases have been carefully picked because they have an
[3:45:28.400 --> 3:45:38.400]  establishment background and when the signal came that donald trump's uh anti uh i would say
[3:45:38.400 --> 3:45:46.000]  donald trump's a kind of classic personal leadership style and the idiosyncrasies of his
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:52.880]  personality came to the forefront and they weren't the homogenized bullshit that we've
[3:45:52.880 --> 3:46:01.440]  gotten from your typical mainstream career politicians well we'll just declare him crazy
[3:46:01.440 --> 3:46:10.080]  and try to move him on make no mistake about it if this should fail the democrats and some
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:18.960]  establishment republicans have a an impeachment fallback position this is how much donald trump
[3:46:18.960 --> 3:46:27.040]  threatens the new world order this is how much of a crimp he puts in the plans of george seros
[3:46:27.040 --> 3:46:36.160]  and others for a one world globalist government in which we give up all of our american sovereignty
[3:46:36.160 --> 3:46:43.760]  and any claim to the constitutional rights that are guaranteed to us by that great document
[3:46:43.760 --> 3:46:52.400]  make no mistake about it the entrenched two-party duopoly in washington that has run this country
[3:46:52.400 --> 3:47:01.920]  into the ground will never come to terms with president donald trump first they tried to deny
[3:47:01.920 --> 3:47:10.720]  him the presidency when that failed they tried to destabilize his presidency and to delegitimize it
[3:47:10.720 --> 3:47:19.360]  and now that that has failed and particularly because he's making real progress on issues
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:27.440]  such as our economy and our economic well-being such as obama care well they have to get him out
[3:47:27.440 --> 3:47:35.600]  of there and in their view the sooner the better who's behind this effort the elites the power
[3:47:35.600 --> 3:47:43.120]  the power elites in new york and washington and london and paris and elsewhere those who would
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:54.240]  profit mightily for from future wars war in syria for example and they will give no quarter there is
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:48:02.240]  no limit to what they will attempt to do we've seen the effort to destroy alex jones the man
[3:48:02.240 --> 3:48:13.040]  and his family we have seen them seek to kill nigel forage i myself have been poisoned i have been
[3:48:13.040 --> 3:48:21.600]  the subject of a suspicious hit and run which totaled the car that i was riding in but thank
[3:48:21.600 --> 3:48:32.560]  my god i was not injured and i will not be silenced nor will alex jones nor will any of the other of
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:40.720]  those on the twitter ban list that i read only days ago they're going to try to take our president out
[3:48:41.280 --> 3:48:48.800]  and we are going to have to mobilize public opinion against this it was only a matter of time
[3:48:48.800 --> 3:48:56.640]  because they see in trump's individualism and his leadership style they see something far
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:06.240]  different far more dangerous to them he's not reading off a script written by the establishment
[3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:14.480]  he's not being handed talking points by some 25 year old who reports to ryan's prebis who sadly
[3:49:14.480 --> 3:49:23.040]  reports to paul ryan not the president of the united states yet we see patriots like
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:33.120]  anthony scaramucci or rick richard rick grannell true trumpites those who are in the front lines
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:39.520]  of the trump revolution how many hours did anthony scaramucci spend on mainstream media
[3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:47.120]  defending donald trump and attacking his competitors yet you won't find those gentlemen
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:56.720]  in the trump administration where they belong it's a disgrace yes the threat that our president
[3:49:57.280 --> 3:50:05.600]  faces is from within and from without i saw a t-shirt last night that inspired me i'm going to
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:13.600]  redesign it it says quite simply i love the donald but i didn't vote for jared kushner
[3:50:14.240 --> 3:50:24.000]  and that sums it up the jared kushner's the the ryan's prebis's the gary cone the former
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:32.000]  goldman head who is now uh donald trump's chief economic advisor despite his opposition to all
[3:50:32.000 --> 3:50:38.640]  of the economic philosophies of donald trump these men are not serving the president well
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:48.240]  my confidence my belief is in donald trump as i said in the 30 hour marathon when donald trump has
[3:50:48.240 --> 3:50:56.000]  all the information he will invariably make the right decision but virtually no one in this
[3:50:56.000 --> 3:51:03.680]  administration with outside of a handful can be trusted because sadly many of them do not share
[3:51:04.320 --> 3:51:13.120]  the president's vision or the president's agenda so strap yourself in you're going to need that
[3:51:13.120 --> 3:51:21.680]  seatbelt we are in for the fight of the century we won this election for the cause of americanism
[3:51:21.680 --> 3:51:29.120]  we put donald trump in the white house and we will not let him be removed by some crazy left
[3:51:29.120 --> 3:51:35.920]  wing globalist cabal that thinks they know better than we do what is good for america
[3:51:36.720 --> 3:51:43.760]  alex thanks for breaking in with that news it is timely next week we will bring dr franklin
[3:51:43.760 --> 3:51:50.160]  brothers back to tell us exactly technically how they are seeking to strangle our communications
[3:51:50.160 --> 3:51:58.640]  on the internet but more importantly what you can do to fight it you heard alex jones he is the
[3:52:00.560 --> 3:52:09.440]  the leader here if you ask me he's the mvp and that is why the personal campaign of
[3:52:09.440 --> 3:52:19.600]  vituporation against him that is why you see him parried on television shows which ironically
[3:52:20.240 --> 3:52:28.800]  showed the actual activities of the radical left but describe it to those of us who are here fighting
[3:52:28.800 --> 3:52:37.680]  for freedom of expression oh yes they are thousands of fake facebook and twitter posters
[3:52:37.680 --> 3:52:45.040]  there are the so-called computer bots but they're not working for us they're working for the criminal
[3:52:45.040 --> 3:52:53.680]  david brock they're working for the criminal enterprise media matters for america and therefore
[3:52:53.680 --> 3:53:03.200]  we see again the left accusing us of doing what they are doing they do it again and again
[3:53:03.200 --> 3:53:12.480]  so alex was right if you have a facebook tweet a feed if you have a twitter feed if you're on
[3:53:12.480 --> 3:53:22.000]  social media you are an army of one we need you in this fight this is not armchair activism in the
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:28.960]  modern day in the internet age you're on the front lines if you're out there spreading the good word
[3:53:28.960 --> 3:53:39.200]  we work very hard at places like stone cold truth stonezone.com the central florida post
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:48.160]  we work overtime to try to provide the content as they say in computer terms the news as it were
[3:53:48.720 --> 3:53:56.160]  the facts that you need to combat the globalist left but none of us none of it does us a good
[3:53:56.160 --> 3:54:05.280]  good if we are being stifled at the technical level you know it i think it was chairman mau
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:12.240]  who said let a thousand flowers bloom he's also the one who said political power flows
[3:54:12.960 --> 3:54:21.120]  from the barrel of a gun let's take his first quote if we may he's talking about you he's
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:26.800]  talking about your ability to get out there on the net you see something at info wars.com that
[3:54:26.800 --> 3:54:34.080]  you find compelling repost it if you have to shorten it to hide the buzzwords inside the
[3:54:34.080 --> 3:54:42.240]  address you can do that as well there's any number of shortening services online but get the news
[3:54:42.240 --> 3:54:49.760]  out there and as i like to say in my book speeches around the country tweet and retweet until your
[3:54:49.760 --> 3:54:59.920]  fingers hurt quantity matters as well as quality you as an individual can reach thousands of people
[3:54:59.920 --> 3:55:07.760]  you can tell them about the products at the info wars store.com and how those expenditures
[3:55:07.760 --> 3:55:15.760]  support the fight for liberty now it's probably a good time to tell you that the entire defense of
