[00:00.000 --> 00:11.800]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.800 --> 00:19.360]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.360 --> 00:23.360]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.360 --> 00:30.840]  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us it is the seventh day of May
[00:30.840 --> 00:37.120]  2013 I am your host Alex Jones we will be here for the next three hours live
[00:37.120 --> 00:44.200]  William Gean of AliPak one of the major pro sovereignty anti completely open
[00:44.200 --> 00:48.400]  border groups William Gean will be joining us for about 30 minutes in the
[00:48.400 --> 00:53.040]  next hour to really break down what is in the different versions of the amnesty
[00:53.040 --> 00:59.440]  bill that is really the North American Union trillion dollars every five
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.160]  years they're estimating conservatively program that will just complete this
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.400]  country's journey into Banana Republic they try to spin it like it's
[01:08.400 --> 01:15.000]  hospitality have open borders but you can't go to Mexico or Guatemala or
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.800]  Nigeria or Russia for that matter and just say I want to have my babies for
[01:21.800 --> 01:28.280]  free I want free welfare I want you know everything and I'm above the law but in
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.320]  the West the globalist use immigrant populations as a pro government group
[01:33.320 --> 01:38.760]  they don't fund the immigrant groups because they care about them they do it
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.160]  because they're using them to drive down wages and that's what NAFTA and GATT
[01:43.160 --> 01:46.680]  has done NAFTA has destroyed Mexico Mexico's standard of living has gone
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.680]  down look at all the numbers you want to help Mexico you end the drug war you
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.240]  end drug prohibition I don't end a lot of the organized crime and Mexico has
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.320]  more billionaires per capita than any other country in the world because it
[02:01.320 --> 02:07.040]  is totally centralized with a tiny group of filthy rich people who have gotten
[02:07.040 --> 02:11.320]  their money through monopolies from Carlos Slim the richest man in the
[02:11.320 --> 02:16.440]  world he's not really but he's one of the richest new money people in the
[02:16.440 --> 02:23.320]  world it's just unbelievable unbelievable I mean there's a state
[02:23.320 --> 02:26.480]  department warning not to travel to Mexico and we're supposed to just
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.600]  collapse the border completely I would rather Mexico have its own revolution of
[02:32.600 --> 02:39.000]  liberty for freedom revolution of ideas and I'd like to see them with a second
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.360]  amendment I liked it or whatever the free people of Mexico developed you know
[02:43.360 --> 02:48.280]  there was a there's a new NRA video out that I saw last night McBreen showed it
[02:48.280 --> 02:52.240]  to me were you guys or no it was Rob do you get Rob do to give you that I want
[02:52.240 --> 02:55.600]  to play that later he was showing to me in his office where they show all the
[02:55.600 --> 02:59.240]  numbers I already knew this so when I saw it I knew the NRA was telling the
[02:59.240 --> 03:02.480]  truth tell him just watch the NRA go oh they're telling the truth I already knew
[03:02.480 --> 03:05.480]  this I've seen the numbers a lot of you seen them but I want to do a maybe a
[03:05.480 --> 03:09.360]  nightly news report tonight on this I want to review their new ad and then
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.680]  show some of some more documentation that most of the guns the drug cartels
[03:14.680 --> 03:22.440]  are getting are full auto flown in by Wells Fargo Wacovia and others on record
[03:22.440 --> 03:29.360]  in giant cargo planes the Mexican cartels tend to like German weapons I
[03:29.360 --> 03:34.080]  saw a statistic like half of them are German full auto heckler and coke and
[03:34.080 --> 03:41.400]  things and so they've got grenade launchers tanks armored vehicles rocket
[03:41.400 --> 03:49.120]  launchers and full auto I mean Mexican drug cartels have heavy 50s folks full
[03:49.120 --> 03:57.200]  auto you can't buy that hand grenades they buy them from Europe they buy them
[03:57.200 --> 04:04.480]  the US military stuff gets down there full auto m16s full auto 308s reapers you
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.280]  name it and again I as a gun aficionado who studies all this I know this but
[04:09.280 --> 04:17.400]  thank God the NRA is on this they're now blaming the crime in Mexico on the
[04:17.400 --> 04:21.440]  Second Amendment but I did look up some members guess who is getting guns in
[04:21.440 --> 04:26.440]  America because they can't get them in Mexico and guess who is using them to
[04:26.440 --> 04:30.120]  defend themselves and there's now vigilante groups all over Mexico
[04:30.120 --> 04:35.000]  restoring law and order guess who Mexicans are coming here and getting
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.560]  shotguns and rifles and handguns to protect themselves even though they're
[04:39.560 --> 04:44.520]  outgunned with American guns so it's true when Obama doesn't want Mexicans to
[04:44.520 --> 04:49.280]  get guns it's just like he doesn't want Americans to have guns that's what's
[04:49.280 --> 04:53.200]  going on he's side with the drug cartels and that pig government down there
[04:53.200 --> 04:59.000]  against the Mexican people having a right to defend their families

[08:12.040 --> 08:35.280]  listening to Alex Jones this song touches my very soul
[08:42.040 --> 08:53.720]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central we're here live rebroadcast
[08:53.720 --> 09:01.200]  on many stations as well XM 166 I think tomorrow it goes to channel 244 the
[09:01.200 --> 09:09.440]  news websites are info wars.com and prisonplanner.com I had quite an
[09:09.440 --> 09:18.920]  epiphany this morning while hiking with my son in the lush spring morning and
[09:18.920 --> 09:25.120]  the epiphany is I thought I've had so many times but it hit me so hard and with
[09:25.120 --> 09:32.920]  such clarity that the reason I get so frustrated and so angry and almost
[09:32.920 --> 09:37.040]  described my disgust at tyranny and globalist and bullies like that of
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.560]  claustrophobia because that's what it is I want them off my back I want them out
[09:42.560 --> 09:49.040]  of my life I have so much love for beauty and innocence and goodness and
[09:49.040 --> 09:56.080]  that is what is all over the world that is what dominates creation but evil has
[09:56.080 --> 10:01.760]  a hunger to be in control and so this paradox historically is always there
[10:01.760 --> 10:09.400]  and I just cry out for justice I I resonate for truth and I'm not up here
[10:09.400 --> 10:15.160]  saying I'm a high and mighty moral person because of that I am just a natural
[10:15.160 --> 10:23.840]  man I'm a simple man but common sense and
[10:23.840 --> 10:33.200]  simpleness in this modern mad world is a revolutionary idea and when you study
[10:33.200 --> 10:38.360]  reality when you study governments and political systems like I do no
[10:38.360 --> 10:45.640]  exaggeration 18 hours a day I even dream about political situations in the
[10:45.640 --> 10:50.080]  New World Order as many people do things that you're focused on you dream about
[10:50.080 --> 10:54.000]  most coaches I know say they dream about coaching they dream about games
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.680]  whether it's basketball golf football baseball it's the same thing I eat drink
[10:59.680 --> 11:11.880]  and sleep veritas I want veritas and I just feel so incredibly empowered and
[11:11.880 --> 11:19.920]  and and and just so appreciative of consciousness and then I see people
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.080]  dumbed down I see people misled I see people who feel bad about themselves
[11:26.080 --> 11:33.840]  because Madison Avenue has taught them to feel inadequate so that Madison
[11:33.840 --> 11:40.440]  Avenue can then sell them lies in the name of making you complete when it
[11:40.440 --> 11:47.120]  actually makes you even more incomplete you were born complete I mean I was
[11:47.120 --> 11:51.920]  just thinking about how everything is incredible how driving down the highway
[11:51.920 --> 12:00.320]  and and seeing hawks on on light poles and police cars flashing lights and
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.880]  cars tail lights fading in and out through the hills at night what Robert
[12:05.880 --> 12:11.280]  Plant was just singing about and the breeze and how you'll catch the smell of
[12:11.280 --> 12:18.400]  flowers and just how magic everything is how incredible it all is how good it
[12:18.400 --> 12:27.680]  all is I was exercising yesterday evening and I looked up and whatever they
[12:27.680 --> 12:32.240]  called the official White House helicopter Marine 1 I think is the name
[12:32.240 --> 12:39.680]  of it and I guess Obama's here in two days so they had Marine 1 and yesterday
[12:39.680 --> 12:46.880]  I'm sitting there it's a pure blue sky totally gorgeous it's like six o'clock at
[12:46.880 --> 12:52.800]  nine I went and exercised and came back into the nightly news and I'm there
[12:52.800 --> 12:58.680]  jogging through the woods and I hear this big helicopter and I look up over
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.480]  the hills and here comes Marine 1 and it flies right over me and it was just
[13:05.480 --> 13:13.520]  such an assault it was an alien Skynet globalist craft serving and doing a
[13:13.520 --> 13:18.600]  test run for the Emperor's arrival and then the Emperor is nothing but the
[13:18.600 --> 13:25.000]  great Oz projection I am the great and powerful Oz yeah that's the old Marine
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.920]  1 we've got on screen for TV viewers it's the new Black Hawk Marine 1 type in
[13:29.920 --> 13:32.440]  the new Black Hawk Marine 1 because it was a big Black Hawk but with the white
[13:32.440 --> 13:35.400]  top and the green bottom
[13:39.360 --> 13:46.400]  and I just wanted to be away from it I and it brought to mind thousands of
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.800]  crystallized thoughts of just the stupid red carpets and the pageantry and how
[13:51.800 --> 13:56.440]  none of it means anything people say well Alex if Hollywood and all this
[13:56.440 --> 14:01.240]  means nothing then you know why have you gone and hung out with Hollywood stars
[14:01.240 --> 14:05.200]  and people well I'll tell you you know ten years ago I was still not really
[14:05.200 --> 14:09.720]  into it but it was interesting but I'm certainly not into it now unless I
[14:09.720 --> 14:15.160]  respect someone and I think they're an interesting creative person yes that's
[14:15.160 --> 14:19.680]  what I saw over Austin the Black Hawk Marine 1 United States of America I
[14:19.680 --> 14:23.000]  couldn't read the United States but I could see the white on the tail from
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.480]  seeing it and tell that it said United States of America it's kind of like a
[14:25.480 --> 14:28.760]  road sign you can read it before it comes into view perfectly just by the
[14:28.760 --> 14:37.600]  outline and it's all about how they're God it's all about how they're above the
[14:37.600 --> 14:45.360]  law I get these emails I see the comments about hey you know so we had
[14:45.360 --> 14:52.600]  martial law in Boston you people are nothing you don't count I read one of
[14:52.600 --> 14:57.720]  those YouTube comments yesterday you know the police are the professionals and
[14:57.720 --> 15:01.160]  that's been the attitude throughout history the government is up on a
[15:01.160 --> 15:05.600]  pedestal and it's sovereign and it has rights and it's God and you're scum
[15:05.600 --> 15:11.400]  that's how 98% of other governments conservatively you can count on one
[15:11.400 --> 15:23.080]  hand so quasi free societies quasi free and they were usually societies that
[15:23.080 --> 15:29.040]  came out of incredible tyranny that was so horrible people codified basic human
[15:29.040 --> 15:34.520]  rights that were in stone punishable by death if you violated them because it's
[15:34.520 --> 15:41.720]  so dangerous to turn the worst people loose in society in a tyranny that's a
[15:41.720 --> 15:45.440]  tyranny works you get rid of the checks and balances the worst in the society
[15:45.440 --> 15:51.160]  will take control and I started thinking about how they had the FBI counter
[15:51.160 --> 15:58.480]  terrorism deputy director on CNN I played the clip yesterday go and listen we
[15:58.480 --> 16:04.000]  record everything you do we can go back in time and hear everything the Zarnev
[16:04.000 --> 16:10.800]  brothers said the deadpatsy tamerlin and the other one and he smiled about it
[16:10.800 --> 16:18.040]  with pleasure in an egomaniac criminal energy hiking the leg urinating on us
[16:18.040 --> 16:23.760]  criminology display I mean I've seen the look in the serial killers in the dock
[16:23.760 --> 16:28.520]  at trials I've seen the look of criminals I've been in juvenile multiple times
[16:28.520 --> 16:34.400]  until I got out on trial in fights I've been around criminals ladies and gentlemen
[16:34.400 --> 16:39.520]  and I know the look in their eye the enjoyment in cheating people in lying
[16:39.520 --> 16:44.440]  to people in getting things over on them and I saw it in that FBI agent size the
[16:44.440 --> 16:48.880]  enjoyment how they can go back and pull up years of every phone call we made
[16:48.880 --> 16:54.760]  recordings of it not just the text and everything you do recorded on record
[16:54.760 --> 16:58.880]  that was known back in the telecommunications act of 96 that's how
[16:58.880 --> 17:02.960]  dumb they think you are and I'm the conspiracy theory person for telling you
[17:02.960 --> 17:08.000]  things that are admitted fact that is flaming criminality oh it's to keep us
[17:08.000 --> 17:19.440]  safe from Adam Gadon the grandson of the head of the ADL formally and then the
[17:19.440 --> 17:28.160]  other four leaders of al-Qaeda are all us born trained
[17:30.360 --> 17:36.120]  known CIA operatives I'm like if there's a drill if their own CIA payroll if they
[17:36.120 --> 17:39.720]  been protected if they've got a history of the FBI it's a staged event look at
[17:39.720 --> 17:44.040]  the drill they had which they admit they have but now won't talk about and then
[17:44.040 --> 17:49.840]  all and then oh how did I just guess minutes after it happened in overdrive
[17:49.840 --> 17:54.760]  Monday with Richard Belzer on the show that it'll be people connected to the
[17:54.760 --> 18:01.280]  CIA and FBI protected and there'll be a drill and there'll be a stand down and
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.480]  then they'll kill the patsy's or cut the other one's throat out I mean because
[18:05.480 --> 18:10.400]  they run the same blueprint by the way I've got to before I get into all this
[18:10.400 --> 18:16.720]  big news I've got to apologize I just read the Wikipedia entry on Iron Man and
[18:16.720 --> 18:20.160]  it turns out there was a last-minute re-edit which I confirmed through our
[18:20.160 --> 18:30.920]  reporters in LA and I went and saw Iron Man last night and it was it was very
[18:30.920 --> 18:42.600]  cartoonish very stupid at the end still entertaining and I went and saw the film
[18:42.600 --> 18:48.800]  and they openly tell you that defense contractors are staging the terror
[18:48.800 --> 18:53.440]  attacks and running the Pentagon program to counter the terrorist and they go
[18:53.440 --> 18:59.880]  it's supply and demand we run all sides it's full spectrum dominance now no one
[18:59.880 --> 19:05.560]  else has said that but me I mean sure we know governments for 200 300 years have
[19:05.560 --> 19:09.000]  been funding both sides the Rothschilds have been doing it big banks have been
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.680]  doing it that's a well-known system but they actually say in the movie it's
[19:15.680 --> 19:20.520]  full spectrum dominance we create the terrorism and then we also make the money
[19:20.520 --> 19:26.760]  off fighting it it's supply and demand and then there's a false flag and bin

[24:30.600 --> 24:36.760]  wars are malware Dan Pfeiffer senior advisor the White House told the public
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.360]  and the media do not visit the drudge report because it's helping expose the
[24:42.360 --> 24:45.400]  fact that they're overthrowing the Bill of Rights and Constitution putting our
[24:45.400 --> 24:51.520]  military under you and control buying billions of bullets and now Google is
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.920]  lying and saying that we have malware we scan the site this is not on our site
[24:55.920 --> 24:59.920]  they are liars they did this to drudge a few years ago it came out it was a
[24:59.920 --> 25:05.800]  line and Google is the ultimate hack worldwide they've been caught from
[25:05.800 --> 25:10.720]  France to the US from Canada to Australia with Google cars driving around
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.560]  with antennas on them jacking your computer and hard hacking it it's a
[25:15.560 --> 25:19.960]  felony each time if you're I did this you're talking years in jail breaking
[25:19.960 --> 25:23.520]  into your computer stealing everything on it stealing your passcodes
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.680]  everything in fact guys print me a bunch of articles on that I know Curt link to
[25:27.680 --> 25:37.800]  him but I want to I want to I want to show TV viewers actually articles just
[25:37.800 --> 25:42.640]  type in Google hacks computers Google broke into computers with Google car I
[25:42.640 --> 25:48.240]  mean this is the ultimate malware ultimate surveillance when you set when
[25:48.240 --> 25:51.200]  you're on Google and you set your settings it's not get me Catherine
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.600]  Albrecht back on about Google I want to do a whole show on there it is business
[25:54.600 --> 25:58.480]  insider Google caught secretly hacking Apple software to track people iPhone
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.520]  and Mac users yeah that's nothing print that to no no they hack your actual
[26:02.520 --> 26:06.720]  computer with Google cars Google cars caught hacking I'm already getting into
[26:06.720 --> 26:10.680]  this I said I get into it the next segment this is the ultimate hacking
[26:10.680 --> 26:17.600]  group and it turns out when they said drudge was hacking people or drudge had
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.520]  malware two years ago this is in Kurt's article linked to mainstream news turns
[26:22.520 --> 26:31.360]  out it was Google's own software in the ad packages run by a third party that
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.760]  they said was spying on people so I'm going to explain that again that's just
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.080]  like our government funds Al Qaeda to attack countries then they give them
[26:39.080 --> 26:42.480]  heat-seeking missiles and then we've got to give our rights up because Al Qaeda's
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.880]  got heat-seeking missiles and that's like Google is spying on you but then on
[26:48.880 --> 26:53.040]  its ad software that they buy up every we've used like three different companies
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.960]  to serve our ads Google's bought every one of them they just bought the last
[26:56.960 --> 27:02.360]  company we're now using so we've got to find another one so the only thing our
[27:02.360 --> 27:06.040]  IT people think this may be is that again because we've got some Google
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.360]  software running on one part of things that they're now blocking us because we
[27:10.360 --> 27:15.680]  because they have a freaking monopoly on ad software I mean I'm sorry ladies and
[27:15.680 --> 27:19.160]  gentlemen I have trouble dealing with this level of hypocrisy Google is
[27:19.160 --> 27:22.520]  sued by dozens of customers after snooping on 10 million iPads yeah that's
[27:22.520 --> 27:28.040]  just the latest guys print me all that two years ago they had to plead guilty I
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.360]  think it was in France but they've also got caught doing in here Google hacks
[27:32.360 --> 27:38.800]  computers steals passcodes with Google cars it's the gets the Google cars that
[27:38.800 --> 27:42.560]  go around taking the photos they got an antenna it is did Google get off easy
[27:42.560 --> 27:47.680]  with seven million for for why spy settlement yeah there it is you see a
[27:47.680 --> 27:52.960]  Google car driving around it ain't just taking photos jack of your house okay
[27:52.960 --> 28:02.000]  that is an NSA globalist imperial probe droid that's the same thing that's the
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.760]  same thing the the the smart meters are they bragged 15 years ago they were
[28:06.760 --> 28:10.280]  gonna put quote smart meters on your house you hear smart you better run and
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.160]  all the new all the new appliances from toasters to clock radios to washing
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.200]  machines all of them watch and listen and track everything you're doing and
[28:19.200 --> 28:23.320]  now they say oh we are gonna control the heat in your house I remember reading
[28:23.320 --> 28:25.760]  about that ten years ago and people like you cook they're not gonna control the
[28:25.760 --> 28:29.080]  temp then they come out to yours go and go we actually are gonna control your
[28:29.080 --> 28:36.960]  thermostat I mean if that isn't malware hacking and now I'm getting these
[28:36.960 --> 28:41.080]  reports everywhere and I've just been so busy I told IT to look into it and now
[28:41.080 --> 28:47.440]  Kurt finds about about it because it's in the news that Google is lying and
[28:47.440 --> 28:53.120]  saying we're putting malware on you so you don't go to info wars calm when
[28:53.120 --> 29:02.360]  they are if I'm a sinner they're Satan this is Satan saying I'm evil well get
[29:02.360 --> 29:08.720]  behind me Google get behind me Satan the Elsie Bob bathal met Leviathan in the
[29:08.720 --> 29:18.200]  name of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior get behind me Google NSA NSA who
[29:18.200 --> 29:22.960]  says don't be evil what a joke I'm gonna get to that more later I want to
[29:22.960 --> 29:26.200]  talk more about the universe and how these people are not God even though they
[29:26.200 --> 29:28.480]  want to act like it they just showed me one of the Google cars all these
[29:28.480 --> 29:33.040]  antennas and camera pods and wiring off of it but it's like Google oh they have
[29:33.040 --> 29:37.360]  beer and pinball they have a Google movie coming out they're not threatening

[37:09.760 --> 37:14.520]  putting on a uniform or putting on a suit and serving Mordor and imagining
[37:14.520 --> 37:19.920]  you're part of it all you are is a sucker when you do that and I'm gonna
[37:19.920 --> 37:23.480]  tell you none of you are gonna make it out of this new world order none of us
[37:23.480 --> 37:28.160]  if this thing comes in if this thing actually gets on its feet and it's
[37:28.160 --> 37:31.440]  starting to try to get up from a crouching position it's been crawling
[37:31.440 --> 37:36.920]  and let me tell you it's scary as a baby well it's now a little boy and it's now
[37:36.920 --> 37:40.760]  getting strong and it's now sucking a lot of blood out a lot of countries and a
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.800]  lot of ideas a lot of science out of people and it wants every one of us
[37:44.800 --> 37:53.080]  dead six feet under the New World Order is on a power trip and thinks it's God and
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.880]  I know I'm right I've read all their writings and I sit there and I talked to
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.400]  GQ writers and Esquire writers and all of them and they're just like you you
[38:02.400 --> 38:06.120]  can't really believe this is real you don't really believe they're doing this
[38:06.120 --> 38:16.280]  and I'm like I don't believe it I know it and in a world of universal deceit
[38:16.280 --> 38:20.120]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act as Orwell said and I forget who said in
[38:20.120 --> 38:27.240]  the it was a Dutch philosopher look it up for me in the land of the blind the
[38:27.240 --> 38:31.200]  one-eyed man is king when I say that I see comments on YouTube going how dare
[38:31.200 --> 38:34.760]  you bash blind people is that how politically correct to you are you have
[38:34.760 --> 38:38.840]  no thought process but to say any knowledge is politically correct like
[38:38.840 --> 38:42.680]  an idiocracy when the guy gets up and says I I want to put on a defense I'm
[38:42.680 --> 38:50.560]  not guilty and they go what are you a fag what are you gay you know that's the
[38:50.560 --> 38:54.840]  you know words they use when anybody I've seen it what are you doing reading a
[38:54.840 --> 39:00.720]  book you read too many books what are you a fag I've actually had people tell
[39:00.720 --> 39:06.240]  me that before it was put in aocracy and I bet you money we're gonna be able to
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.920]  ask him I was talking to him yesterday I should ask him that my judge I'll
[39:09.920 --> 39:14.120]  guarantee you he put that in that movie because he I'll bet money when I ask him
[39:14.120 --> 39:20.080]  because he's seen that happen a Rasmus and where was he
[39:20.080 --> 39:30.880]  he was Dutch right Rasmus in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king Dutch
[39:30.880 --> 39:36.600]  Dutch philosopher Rasmus Dutch Renaissance you want to know who I am New
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.800]  World Order I am Renaissance don't know who I am New World Order I am
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.600]  Enlightenment don't know who I am I am freedom you know who I am I am
[39:45.600 --> 39:52.560]  compassion I am justice I am honor I am duty I am will I am commitment I am
[39:52.560 --> 39:59.280]  love I am truthfulness does that mean I don't have my evil side I certainly got
[39:59.280 --> 40:03.880]  it I got a big good side and I got a big evil side but my my good side is a lot
[40:03.880 --> 40:08.160]  bigger than my evil side and you know what I'm a mile wide and a trillion miles
[40:08.160 --> 40:17.880]  deep and so are you so are you and you only live when you commit to good
[40:17.880 --> 40:22.520]  that's when the universe opens up to you all these people serving evil training
[40:22.520 --> 40:30.520]  and evil thinking you'll gain power from evil you will not gain power from evil
[40:30.520 --> 40:40.120]  because you are individually resonating with anything good you are tying into
[40:40.120 --> 40:55.600]  something destructive before there was the light there was darkness and you're
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.120]  going to see more of this this is how the globalists have said that they're
[40:59.120 --> 41:04.760]  going to censor the internet they have said they're going to censor the
[41:04.760 --> 41:12.280]  internet by claiming that all sites not affiliated with the globalist in sub
[41:12.280 --> 41:16.960]  domains are malware or scams they're going to block you from them and they're
[41:16.960 --> 41:20.240]  going to tax the web and they're going to form a new web Google's putting it in
[41:20.240 --> 41:24.200]  a hundred times faster than the rest and you will have no freedom when you're on
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.240]  that new web you will be in subdomains and waive your rights and they want
[41:28.240 --> 41:31.680]  everybody to be in that they want to be dominant that's why they've let you to be
[41:31.680 --> 41:36.280]  somewhat free and other platforms but they said that's all going away so we've
[41:36.280 --> 41:41.000]  built prison planet dot TV to fight the prison planet we're trying to build our
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.400]  own operations we're trying to build our own infrastructure we're putting out
[41:44.400 --> 41:50.920]  print media to begin that development they are going to try to shut us down
[41:50.920 --> 41:56.960]  but they can't do it if you know they want to shut us down and if you'll tell
[41:56.960 --> 42:00.680]  everybody about info wars.com I'm telling you folks they're scared of info
[42:00.680 --> 42:03.840]  wars.com and they're scared of drudgereport.com and I've told you this
[42:03.840 --> 42:07.360]  and now you're seeing them come out with it
[42:07.920 --> 42:16.120]  group calls for hearings into Google CIA ties and NSA Robert David Steele in
[42:16.120 --> 42:20.280]  2006 first told our broadcast they were CIA funded by Incutel it's since been
[42:20.280 --> 42:30.440]  declassified and to have them come out and say we have malware on our site when
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.160]  we don't let me read you the article they did this to drudge in 2010 two and a
[42:35.160 --> 42:42.760]  half years ago turned out it was Google's own software on an ad on a link he
[42:42.760 --> 42:49.880]  linked to and the last time they said this with us it never was that was even
[42:49.880 --> 42:53.760]  the news we looked at it was Google so we got away from Google and then Google
[42:53.760 --> 42:57.280]  bought the company we went with and then Google bought the next company and then
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.240]  Google just bought the other company you understand they've got a near monopoly
[43:01.240 --> 43:09.640]  over ad server systems. Drudge report accused of serving malware again seen at
[43:09.640 --> 43:18.200]  news the White House says don't go there let me let me read to you the article
[43:18.200 --> 43:24.880]  today danger Google warns drudge report and info wars.com are malware an effort
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.360]  to scare folks away from alternative media I don't know why he puts a question
[43:28.360 --> 43:33.520]  mark on it maybe we should change that sub headline to you know this is the
[43:33.520 --> 43:41.320]  ultimate in fraud because Google is the biggest hacker malware scamming criminal
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.040]  group in the internet history and that's conservative I mean it's like two
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.280]  or three times when anybody else is done I just computed it it's probably a
[43:51.280 --> 43:54.400]  hundred times I mean it's just that they are the king of it I'm gonna go over
[43:54.400 --> 44:00.040]  that and everybody should go over the fact of what they're doing. Facebook's a
[44:00.040 --> 44:05.280]  big CIA pump-a-dup scam where they call their users dumb efforts and and how
[44:05.280 --> 44:09.200]  they're scamming you and charging you to send messages and and people committing
[44:09.200 --> 44:16.040]  suicide over it I mean who cares use it like a toilet use Facebook to jack their

[47:45.200 --> 47:50.200]  the web's popularity millions of folks pursue the site daily back in March of
[47:50.200 --> 47:54.520]  2010 the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and an email stating
[47:54.520 --> 47:59.240]  drudge's website was responsible for many viruses popping up throughout the
[47:59.240 --> 48:03.760]  Senate CNET reported that turned out it wasn't true no appreciable drop in

[50:06.640 --> 50:13.880]  incredible it should be satire but it's not it's absurdist it goes on that the
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.520]  Federal Communications Commission documented disclosed that Google Street
[50:16.520 --> 50:18.840]  View an effort to photograph streets that was the cover around the world
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.640]  deliberately collected massive amounts of Wi-Fi payload data including breaking
[50:22.640 --> 50:25.840]  into bank accounts I should add and that information was illegally stored on
[50:25.840 --> 50:29.880]  Oregon storage facility Google attempted to hide the theft from the public and
[50:29.880 --> 50:35.840]  investigators did they go to jail for absconding like you or I would know and
[50:35.840 --> 50:41.320]  then we have a bunch of links to Google's criminal activity they've declared war on

[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:14.600]  document that most the guns that are bought by the cartels are full auto and
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.720]  are flown in by big banks that's come out of that you guys print me while covia

[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.280]  national sovereignty we're gonna be talking to him here in just a moment but
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:01.960]  other big stuff is happening obviously I'm gonna talk more after he leaves us
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:11.160]  today with the situation in the Benghazi gate we're gonna be looking at that
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:18.120]  they've got a credible whistleblowers to speak tomorrow in a hearing now folks
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.440]  I already told you what happened we know what happened it came out they stood
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.800]  down for eight hours while Al Qaeda killed everybody in the building the
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.680]  five regular people in the two seals sheep dipped into CIA who refused orders
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.280]  to stand down they had to fire the head of scent come over because he threw a
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:41.840]  fit they fired it's it's like 10 or more other top admirals in generals they
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.000]  had two predator drones and a C-130 surveillance craft out in the
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.520]  Mediterranean they had drones right above it they sat there and watched the
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.040]  Benghazi security force this is not blowback they went in there and they
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.720]  killed him so they could say the heat-seeking missiles they had a
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.640]  warehouse there full of heat-seeking missiles it's like 18,000 missiles 10,000
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.440]  of them heat-seeking a bunch of them were reportedly there we're into all our
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:14.120]  sources and that's now months later we told you this first by the way get we
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:19.360]  need to get all our sources back on the set all this it was Colonel Schaefer
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.880]  Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer said all that and the guy that was in Tripoli a
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:31.120]  bunch and in Benghazi a former NSA Wayne Madsen and others and they look we
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.760]  know eight-hour stand-down eight-hour stand-down while the CIA Al Qaeda
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:45.960]  security force people are like Al Qaeda CIA yes they run Al Qaeda the CIA is run
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:52.040]  by foreign banks I don't know how I explain this to you it'd be like if
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.920]  aliens landed and they had blue skin and they were commanding our military and
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.760]  our military had collaborated and I'm going hey the aliens are commanding our
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.600]  government the government so legitimate you're but they got their wear and
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.000]  uniforms but see there they don't have blue skin so it's not obvious it's
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.480]  foreign banks Benghazi stand-down denials don't stand up to reason that's
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.120]  Forbes I mean this is getting bigger and bigger and bigger so I'm gonna get into
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:23.680]  that a Senate passes internet sales tax bill and that opposition from
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.760]  conservatives I mean this is incredible it's a track the power to taxes the
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:35.680]  power to destroy it's a total control grid the cyber security bill is this is
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:44.800]  a internet sabotage system as the Google hundred times faster fiber optic goes
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:48.720]  in when that fiber optic is in a nationwide in about three years it's
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.880]  going in Austin it's been putting several other major cities we noticed
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.680]  they're taking over Midwest first why isn't it California why isn't New York
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.440]  they know everybody's fleeing to the middle of the country it's an enemy
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.760]  operation they're putting down their fiber in Austin other areas Austin they
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:08.000]  admit is the agenda 21 take they have maps big we've shown it on TV when we
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.680]  go to their meetings how they're gonna take over here they even describe it as
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:18.440]  their operations and their dominance opera I mean this is this is a
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:23.480]  technocratic takeover but they go oh we drink beer at the campus and act trendy
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.720]  yeah we have we have beards and where where you know rainbow socks they go
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.720]  behind closed doors general pair operations bring them down I mean you
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:40.040]  know this is a this is an enemy operation spies excuse me believe me
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.960]  folks you better look into this man they're sophisticated but if you're
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.640]  aware of their operations we can defeat them so you got that going on I'm gonna
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.560]  talk more about the arm March my thoughts are exactly what Mike Adams has
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:00.720]  said it's at info wars.com on our arm March on DC announced for July 4th is
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:05.520]  Adam Cook has crazy or courageous and he shows both sides of it why you have a
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.640]  right to do that the DC heller did rule you could have guns but they're still
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:14.320]  saying they'll arrest you they are the tyrants they are in the wrong but it but
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:20.160]  does this give them an opportunity well so so so I'm saying you know when I say
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.120]  be there with video cameras I'm not saying be there armed because I can't
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.840]  morally tell people to do something that's so dangerous that's the decision
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:32.120]  you've got to make some talk about that in the third hour because people of your
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:37.840]  spending it saying Jones is endorsing it I am not endorsing it I am I am I am
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.080]  studying it looking at it from both sides you understand that because I I
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:50.120]  respect a lot or a little Rockwell I respect Adam but Adam does pull you know
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.840]  pure stunts but his argument is he pulls stunts for liberty I get it fortune
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.240]  favors the bold there is a tide in the affairs of men when taking up the flood
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.760]  leads on to fortune our fortune is liberty I get it I get it but at the
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:10.360]  same time when people are like I hope you're men enough to be there with your
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:16.960]  gun bud see don't punch my buttons I'm man enough to play this smart I'm man
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.520]  enough for the long haul I'm man enough to go all the way and do what's really
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:29.360]  dangerous but I I I I I'm studying and it resonates with people and just the
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:34.080]  idea is is part of the animating contest of liberty now we've had multiple
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.520]  senators I'll show these articles while our guest speaks say it's going to cost
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.080]  trillions it is the North American Union it is the end of our country you can't
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.520]  go to Mexico how about Mexico is that's 80% roughly in the illegal immigration I
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.360]  can't go there and have free babies I can't go there and become a citizen
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.480]  Jesse Ventura has tried to become a citizen and they've told him no a former
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:58.680]  governor Jesse Ventura you know his his his his daughter can't come down there
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.480]  and have a baby free but see America has so much hospitality and the
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.600]  authoritarians guilt everybody not to save Mexico that's in horrible tyranny a
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:13.520]  collapsing failed state look at how that's hidden in plain view not to help
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.000]  them no to bring all of America down the globalist admit they want you poor so
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.920]  you can never stand up like Mexico that has more billionaires per capita than
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.400]  any other country in the world they have more billionaires in the US not per
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.960]  capita period because you've got one tenth of one tenth of one tenth of one
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.360]  percent I mean literally it's less than a dozen people that own the whole
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:40.280]  stinking thing and if you get up at a police in black uniforms drop by and
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.000]  line you up and shoot you I've seen the videos and so where they line people up
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.480]  and shoot them and it's not even in our news okay so that's what's coming to
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.240]  America and I want freedom for all those people but instead they've hyped up
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:01.000]  nationalism will reconquistila infosora the reconquering America's evil all the
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  problems of Mexico or America well it's the globalist are part of it but not me
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.360]  and this is the takeover and William Gean I appreciate him joining us of Allie
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:13.600]  Pack he's the leader of Americans for legal immigration pack or Allie pack
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.840]  which one of the largest grassroots organizations in America Allie pack dot
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:23.320]  com William Gean dot com as well William you you you've heard me going over this
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.880]  Obama's blaming the Second Amendment for what happens in Mexico and we know it's
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.240]  armored vehicles and full auto and grenade launchers they're getting guys
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:38.840]  you pull up Bloomberg Wacovia or I'll pull it up Wacovia Wells Fargo laundered
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.640]  376 billion dollars I mean they're running all this and then blaming us and
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.760]  now they want to fully split the country open William Gean what's happening
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.760]  Alex first of all thank you so much for having me on this very very critical time
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:56.440]  you know the Senate is about to consider the Sam's to Bill in 48 hours in front
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.960]  of the Judiciary Committee and I listened to your lead in you are so on the
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:04.640]  money you you're right on the mark maybe not on every detail but when you
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.160]  describe the United States as facing a form of treason from within or a type of
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.560]  warfare being practiced against the United States citizens I am so much in
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:17.000]  agreement with you there and it's a thing that as a leader of a national
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.600]  organization I've become more vocal about over the last several months I
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.040]  believe the United States faces a constellation of threats just like our
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.640]  bodies walking down the street every day face a constellation of risk from
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:35.640]  accident and disease and microbes the United States being what it is the most
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.960]  valued real estate on the planet faces a constellation of threats and the guns
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.560]  you know I've been on your program several times over the years and I've
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.120]  warned people across the country I said beware the three nation killers there
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.000]  are three things they want to do to the country which are partial political
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.160]  revolution of 2010 held back quite a bit okay but now that that hold up though
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.800]  that that time we bought the country has expired and they're back and the three
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:06.200]  nation killers are free speech they want people to live like they live in
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.320]  Canada and Mexico as part of this integration in Canada William Gean and
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.200]  Alex Jones would have already been yanked in front of a tribunal with the
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.440]  ability to imprison or fine us terribly if Alex Jones and William Gean were
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.080]  doing what we're doing in Mexico today we probably both be dead long ago and so
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.680]  they want the freedom of speech down they want the second amendment destroyed
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:32.360]  and the American gun laws brought into equilibrium with united with they're
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:37.320]  moving on every front this is the radical transformation Obama promised the
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:42.160]  corporations the media the globalist the communist this is the full move this is
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.320]  it this is the total attack this is the war this is the key jump point and they
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.680] 've got control of most of the most of the major networks they've even got
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:55.480]  Rupert Murdoch of News Corp and Fox News now on board with the Amnesty lobby so
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.280]  most you know I used to be on Fox News all the time I have not been back on
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:03.920]  Fox News in two years since I announced and announced correctly that the
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.960]  Democrats were going to use large-scale illegal immigrant voters in the Western
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.680]  States to stop the Tea Party revolution that was the last time you heard William
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.480]  Gean on a major national network because the doors closed the main and many
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.360]  others like me at Fox they've studied us for several years because they know
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.640]  that my organization Americans for legal immigration pack played a key role in
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:28.440]  the beating amnesty in 2006 2007 and in 2010 so now they're lying we're gonna
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.960]  break it when you come back get into this but what I've seen them is doing is
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.800]  Obama's angering immigrants with his tough new bill when it's total amnesty
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:40.920]  basically and then they call it an anti-immigrant bill is that correct no
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:44.640]  it's not anti-immigrant that's just that please don't throw me in that briar patch no
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.000]  I know that's what I'm saying I mean they're there remember what they did five
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.640]  years ago when they wouldn't let people read the bill we're gonna talk about
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.240]  what's really in the different versions you're up there on the hill this is
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:59.120]  coming up for a vote very soon in committee it's all happening internet

[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:17.800]  Lindsay Graham nasty little creature that he is is out whitewashing Benghazi
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.480]  while acting like he's exposing it Graham I think the dam is about to
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.200]  break on Benghazi and on his senate site on his Facebook he says I think the dam
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.320]  is about to break on Benghazi we're going to find a system failure before
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:40.200]  daring and after the attacks a stand down by the special forces they were ordered
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:45.600]  to stand down for eight hours done the sick we knew when it happened a week
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.280]  after it was the al-qaeda security force hired I'm gonna go back to William
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:54.560]  gain on the immigration thing it's all happening internet taxes open borders
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:00.040]  all of it but we can beat it why are they so desperate now why are they why
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.600]  are they able to get so many Republicans to go along with us now and how do we
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.040]  beat this and what is the immigration bill really do for why won't they let
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.840]  the public see a copy of it why a senator sessions saying if we can read it
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.040]  it will die why are they demonizing Ted Cruz for saying we should be able to
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.160]  read it well I'll answer each one of those in order but first I want to thank
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.680]  you again back when I encourage senator Graham to come forward about his
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:29.120]  homosexuality secret I came under a lot of heat across the country and your show
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:34.720]  was the first show to like you know give me a fair spin with what I had to say
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:38.080]  and I'll always be grateful to Alex Jones show for that because I believe
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.480]  that Lindsey Graham will sing and dance any tune the elites want him to to the
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:47.000]  detriment of the American public because they have the power to put his hidden
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.520]  lifestyle on every major network and destroy him at any moment whereas we do
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.440]  not have that a by the way two days after you did that I didn't know you were
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:56.640]  gonna do that on air but you're a respected guy and you're up there on the
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.960]  hill he suddenly reversed himself on the immigration issue back to the pro
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:06.040]  sovereignty policy he did he was well he withdrew from the negotiations with
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.320]  Janet and Polytana and Barack Obama and his popularity levels in South
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:15.440]  Carolina plummeted because that was part of my trap I knew that since I was a
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.320]  tea party guy that the press including comedy send what it would be comedy
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:23.440]  central specifically but I would take a lot of heat which washed over me it was
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.920]  like flames but I was untouched by the flames maybe a couple of singed eyebrows
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.920]  here and there from the calls that I received from angry people thinking I
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.160]  was just being mean to gay people which wasn't my intention at all but Lindsey
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.640]  Graham's approval ratings dropped to unelectable levels now since that time
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:44.360]  they've been rebuilding him slowly back up to try to save their brand save their
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.680]  guy because he's up for reelection this year but Lindsey Graham is a traitor
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.720]  against the people of the United States and him and people like Marco Rubio and
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.800]  John McCain I don't know what all the elites have on Rubio and McCain like I
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.000]  do Graham but they'll do and say anything because these people are just
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.720]  really good at controlling people now that brings us back to how we defeat
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.280]  these people again how do we stop s744 which is a nation killer it is an
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:14.760]  illegal immigration amnesty neutron bomb Alex senator Jeff Sessions who I wish so
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:18.880]  deeply was the president of the United States of America right now with a VP
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:25.560]  like Joe or Pio of Jeff Sessions office has been scrambling to read through this
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:30.160]  844 plus page bill and try to decipher and interpret what it means for the
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:33.280]  American public and they found a couple important things first of all between
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.640]  the illegal immigrants that it turns in the voters eventually and the increase
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:42.280]  in legal immigration by 50% when we're already as a nation at a hyper or
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:47.520]  historically high immigration level combined with the new visa programs 57
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:51.840]  million people predominantly from third world countries would be allowed to
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:55.080]  immigrate to the United States or enter with a visa in the next 10 years I'm
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:00.680]  going to repeat that 57 million Alex we've got a population of about 308
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.040]  million and the country so look around you if you're in traffic in your house
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.000]  look at your window and have the kids in the country right now people you say
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.600]  sure half the kids in the country I've seen the statistics are the children of
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.280]  immigrants this is a total rewrite of America and it's a rewrite towards
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:22.480]  third world police states I mean this is incredible well they're bringing in
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.440]  people that are not like the people that have governed America that founded
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.600]  America not like the people that have governed America for over 200 years not
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.900]  like the people that have paid all the taxes for over 200 years not like the
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:37.000]  people who have paid the ultimate sacrifice with their own or their
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.320]  children's blood in the wars to protect the US well they come from
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:45.240]  authoritarian countries and some of them do appreciate freedom because of it but
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:50.800]  the vast majority like 90% vote once they become citizens of to take my guns
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:54.680]  how would you leave a country where you couldn't have guns and then come here
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.240]  and take my guns I guess because they've never had guns they don't know well
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:02.040]  it's not that they're not even literate in their own languages they have no idea
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.120]  of the American principles and concepts what you stand for what I stand for what
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.560]  90% of the people out there in America that are indigenous to right now even
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.200]  the people who are liberal you know a lot of these a lot of these people on the
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:17.080]  left side of the Democrats they're gonna be smiling real big in the first ten
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.160]  years as Republicans lose everything except for a couple of enclaves and a
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.040]  couple of places but then their smiles are gonna be short-lived when they
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.760]  figured out that whatever their particular issue was be it the environment
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.600]  be it gay rights be it you know oh my god this country is gonna resemble China
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:37.880]  stay there I mean ladies and gentlemen that's agenda 21 they're gonna keep us

[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:15.200]  trying to pass it today on a committee just like California where the
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.840]  government can say your kid gave consent in a public school to have
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:23.360]  inoculations really can they give consent to drink liquor or have sex

[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:37.080]  Austin police chief wants to make it where illegal aliens basically don't get
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.240]  arrested he was on the news talking about that you know for crimes they
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:44.720]  commit and stuff I mean it's just or doesn't want them deported I mean it is
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:50.000]  just twilight zone because they want the magnet they want to bring the
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.920]  immigrants here not to come here and bust their butts and build the country
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.000]  not to come here and and and and and get into the free market become wealthy
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.320]  and the people that work hard go to the top no they say come here and just get
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:06.960]  on welfare just vote to take these guys guns hey you're used to being a slave
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:14.040]  and Africa or Mexico or Eastern Europe come to America the head of alley pack
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:19.720]  William Guinness here finishing up with this bill what it does I mean especially
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:22.280]  from what I've seen what you've written about and what sessions has said trying
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:25.520]  to read in the last few days it's kind of a repeat of what the bipartisan bill
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.880]  did before well it's it's that plus everything they've ever wanted you know
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.440]  and the main key here is first with you know information is important the
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.760]  people are almost oversaturated in information we've got to get people
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:41.120]  organized our main two key points for doing that is our primary website
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:47.720]  alley pack.us alipac.us and a petition site we have that against amnesty.com
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:51.720]  both of those websites are carrying the information to keep people up to date on
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:55.400]  this particular bill the problems with the bill the full talking points with
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:58.760]  the bill and we give people the phone numbers they need to call what they need
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:02.400]  to be saying how they need to be going about it and we need people to not be
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.280]  paralyzed here if you're if you can't donate time to make a call if you can't
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.080]  donate a dollar to an organization you're already neutralized if you like to
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.280]  hang on and listen in horror as things fall apart then that's up to you but
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.920]  we've got to take the people that can still stand you know last two months
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:20.960]  I've had people running the other direction past me screaming or laying
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:24.320]  there crying in front of me pretty much saying oh they've got us they've got us
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.800]  this time that we're beaten because the psychological operations the pciops of
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:33.960]  the globalists have already neutralized so many people that have immersed
[01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.400]  themselves in this information and I've been telling them look you don't know
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.640]  the outcome of the battle but the same thing happened in 2006 2007 and the
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:44.880]  first few weeks or months of the battle we had people running the other direction
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:50.320]  saying oh the enemy is so superior in finances with this George Soros money and
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.520]  all this stuff we can't beat them they've got us they've got us we need the
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.720]  people who are willing to march towards the disaster that are willing to put
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:00.600]  their hands on the tiger's tail put their hands around this ancient serpent's
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:04.560]  neck and to fight back when the outcome of the battle of whether the Lord is
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.800]  going to preserve the United States or not it's still undetermined at this
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.840]  point and to move forward on these people we're organized in the alley pack
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:16.120]  dot us and against amnesty.com today we've turned everybody loose calling
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.680]  the Senate Judiciary Committee which there are links to on our homepage for
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:23.880]  all the numbers for those members that's a battle we think it's most likely we're
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.000]  going to lose because that's that committee has been stacked with people
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.720]  like Lindsey Graham and Jeff Blake and the gang of they but what about stuff
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.600]  where they advertise to be legals come have free babies come get on food stamps
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:41.640]  I mean this is fraud and and and again I can't go to Mexico and get food stamps
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.080]  and a free birth and everything I mean it's and then it's like you're just not
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:51.200]  a nice person it's so incredible there's judicial watching covers USDA records
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.200]  sponsoring us food stamp program for illegal aliens and they advertise it in
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.160]  Mexico I mean this is treason and you know about the North American Union
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:03.520]  deal 2005 with Bush and Fox and the Prime Minister glad you mentioned that
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.720]  Alice because look just the other day when the president of the United States
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:13.040]  was in Mexico he told it was reported ABC News that he was there to increase
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:17.960]  economic integration on in the hemisphere or the continent now we never
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:20.600]  voted for that that would require a treaty by the Senate that's never been
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:25.480]  passed the American public has never agreed to further integrate our
[01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:30.000]  economies which means integrating our population but Bush signs the deal Bush
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:34.080]  signs the deal the first one that the well Clinton put the NAFTA into place
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.720]  and then Bush launched the SPP security and prosperity partnership and now
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:43.440]  Obama has continued I did a quick search right before coming on your show on
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.960]  Obama economic integration I found two very fresh things that I want to
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:55.240]  mention first of all from the Christian science monitor is praising this
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:58.720]  what Obama did it said President Obama's trip to Mexico will help better
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:02.600]  integrate the two economies and a piece of Senate immigration reform bill
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:07.080]  focuses on integrating the mainly Mexican population of undocumented
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:10.840]  immigrants each country must respect each other sensitivities on these two
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.240]  integrations then the article which just came out May 1st goes on to say very
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:22.440]  key here it says taken together the president's trip and the immigration
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.840]  reform bill are forcing Americans to come to grips with Mexico and Mexicans
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:31.080]  in a way not seen since the controversial passage of the North American trade
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:35.680]  and what does it mean come to grips it's not like Switzerland is bordering us I
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.960]  would want to border France it's going bankrupt this is like boring North Korea
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.160]  forcing Americans forcing Americans right there where where is that coming
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:51.120]  from forcing Americans who in the world is it that is forcing Americans but
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:55.040]  there it is written third paragraph of the Christian science model no they
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:59.480]  admit it's globalism they are merging the three countries and and we'll and
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:04.920]  taking our rights away and then telling Americans don't be nationalistic while
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.840]  the Ford Foundation for 60 years has funded the most radical anti-American
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:14.200]  nationalism the world has ever seen in Mexico let's just be honest about this
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:19.480]  and folks you think your taxes are high now you the guns everything it's gone
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:26.800]  we are going to collapse which is the plan I mean this is folks it is like it
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.840]  is like jumping into a sinking ship and again they love it they absolutely love
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:36.080]  it because the globalists are exempt from all of this how do we beat it because
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.800]  you know they said we couldn't beat the gun bill and they'll stage something
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.240]  else or you know there'll be some new shooting they're gonna come back but you
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.440]  know we have got to beat them now on this if here's our last shot and I mean our
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.520]  last shot at this okay if we can slow this build down which we've already
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:55.040]  done those of us already fighting through alley pack dot us and against
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.880]  damage.com we've helped slow this build down and every day that we can slow it
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.280]  down every day we can get another Alex Jones show out there on this topic
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:09.360]  every day people learn more about the national biometric ID in the bill the
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:16.160]  nine trillion dollar price tag on the bill the waivers for all of the the
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:21.200]  enforcement language yeah let me stop you let me stop you again the other bills
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.280]  had that before where we all get basically a North American ID and we've
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:29.600]  already seen the ads for five years they already issue a North American ID I
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:34.480]  mean this is the total to this is it this is the end of America we have one
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.240]  more chance if we can stop this bill now we stopped this bill I think there's
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.360]  probably a 70% plus chance that Obama will engage in further dictatorial
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:48.240]  unlawful unconstitutional activities unless our current lawsuit that the
[01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.040]  immigration and customer enforcement retired union is is showing some
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.440]  promise with the Texas judge Obama will probably just try to make it happen
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:02.480]  anyway our goal at alley pack is to kill this bill stop this bill educate more
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:06.400]  people and instead of letting them go to sleep take the energy of the gun fight
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.240]  that just happened take the energy of Benghazi gate that is built up take the
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:15.800]  energy of the resistance to the illegal alien amnesty overthrow of the American
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:21.120]  Republic and channel everything we've got into the 2014 elections the 2014
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:27.920]  elections will be our last shot to take civilian control of the United States
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.800]  government back over and we've got look US senator Lindsey Graham is on the
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.320]  chopping block if we get a good well-financed well organized candidates
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:38.520]  to run against Lindsey Graham and South Carolina and I go down there and stir
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:42.920]  things up enough you know hey we might be able to take him out the people of
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.960]  office the people in Arizona please people you did so great with the
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:52.280]  immigration legislation and now you sent us back John McCain and Jeff Blake and I
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.280]  know that John McCain and Jeff Blake not only lied to you guys in Arizona but
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.400]  they lied to you with over 30 million dollars spent on their campaigns and
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:03.760]  Rubio lied to you we got to go after the liars and let me tell you the main
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:07.240]  ones we need to go after are the Republican liars Alex now granted most
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:12.640]  Democrats are against this thing too but the poll numbers show us that ninety
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:16.640]  eighty two percent of Republicans are against and truth the truth be known
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:21.040]  what Lindsey Graham is doing what Marco Rubio is doing and since we're so
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.120]  disadvantaged with opposition having all these billionaires and millionaires
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.480]  like George Soros on their side I am targeting the Republicans and I'll tell
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:32.760]  you something else I got a little bit more respect for Democrat that I
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:37.640]  disagree with that's on lame globalist Star Trek new generation idea about all
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:41.240]  we just need to merge everything at least they're being more open about it I
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:45.640]  have more contempt for the Marco Rubio's of the world and the John McCain and the
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.920]  Jeff Blake to go around lying everybody their entire job is to sit there and a
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.760]  lot of people and to see people on the biggest scale of them all and so I have
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.200]  more contempt for them including in my home state of North Carolina I want to
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.560]  say this listen they are going to take the guns they've set up Homeland
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:04.800]  Security teamed up with all these foreigners who think they're part of
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:10.440]  the government to come after everybody and it is going to be a civil war because
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:14.200]  look they plan to have a war with us even if we lay down they're coming to get
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:19.800]  us so I hope people realize supply drain and the fact that they've got us
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:24.880]  cornered and things like that but my thing is it's politics okay there is
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:29.360]  still is a peaceful political hope here if enough American no I know I'm just
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:33.880]  saying we're not here trying to scare people I don't have words describe how
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:39.000]  dire our straights are well remember the part of the movie when John Connors and
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.640]  Crystal Peak and he figures out that it's going to happen and things are going
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.040]  to get terribly just going to do the best again with a little ham radio to keep
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:50.600]  people organized and do what he can you know that's what this feels like but
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:56.240]  we've got to do what we can because even you know politics failing to the degree
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:00.560]  they have that's unacceptable well by the way the good news is hundreds of
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.200]  millions of guns are getting bought 70 million plus just on record in the last
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.920]  few years built we're buying millions arounds people are awake and I mean
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:15.240]  across the board with the Liberty message to white black Hispanic Asian
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:20.840]  people that we can at least talk to you don't that can all be avoidable that can
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:25.240]  all be this no I know but that shows that I understand we need to beat the
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:29.160]  bill but what I'm saying is it shows that people fundamentally know we've got a
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:33.080]  crook government but I mean the government is crazy and people people
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.240]  fear this government and it goes back to Thomas Jefferson you know when people
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.560]  fear the government there's tyranny there is tyranny that's why Obama's
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.440]  talking about it to little student groups and saying but where the voices that
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:49.120]  preach about government tyranny what an anathema what an anathema to the
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:53.480]  intrinsic American experience his comments are and when he talks it's
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:58.040]  clear to those of us that they can see the matrix here that he doesn't talk
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:03.320]  like he's even one of us or a United States citizen at all he let teeth he
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.520]  talks about us and our second amendment rights as if it's something alien that he
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:12.040]  is disbursed into paying homage to because he's sworn oath and he's going
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:16.480]  to pretend like he well no no no that's the tactic Bloomberg says I'm the biggest
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.880]  supporter of the second amendment that's why it means you turn them in they do
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:26.320]  that to neutralize opposition it's like NDA I'm not going to sign it so there's
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.240]  no so there's no opposition then it turns out the White House wrote it and he
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:35.840]  did sign it I mean it's all deception and I believe and I know they're moving at
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:39.480]  mock speed now because they're behind about a decade even their own
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:45.080]  tacticians like Brzezinski say that and they can see that liberty is growing in
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:50.840]  the minds of Americans across the board when you ask why now why now is this but
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:56.360]  since the last election and this one year before the next election cycle really
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:00.600]  takes grip which is usually about January it will be about January 2004 if we
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:06.360]  can stop this bill from passing prior to January 1st of 2004 I predict it will
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:14.080]  not pass and that is giving us a hit in 2014 yeah right two five 2014 and that
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:17.360]  gives us the hit and what we've got to do to turn it off what we've got to do
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:21.880]  right now is locate all the traders all of the people pushing this invasion
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:26.800]  pushing this nation destroying amnesty invasion including Republicans like
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:31.040]  congressman Ted Poe from Texas who we thought was on our side who now
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.840]  suddenly pops up says he supports past citizenship for illegal aliens wow you
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:40.400]  know we've actually had three it's been embarrassing and shocking but after eight
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:45.120]  years of operations we've had to rescind three endorsements in the last no no
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:48.880]  you know why because it's look you see you're finding out who's real now the
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:56.000]  system is uncloking they are going for it all now and 2014 is everything ladies
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.560]  and gentlemen and we have I mean listen I've had I've had these rallies you know
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.400]  against the illegal alien rallies where they're saying America's bad you know
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:06.720]  Mexico Mexico and I've gone to those rallies and a lot of Hispanic Americans
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.080]  have shown up with me saying you know I get it I'm a truck driver and since the
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.720]  Mexican trucks have been let in my money's been cut in half no no I get it
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.280]  and it doesn't even help Mexico I mean why are the mega rich for this like
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:24.440]  Warren Buffett because he wants to bankrupt America the guy gets banker
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:29.360]  bailout money the guy is a crook I mean this guy shut down the keystone
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.240]  pipeline to Texas from Canada these people these people have invested in
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.000]  China they've invested in Mexico in the slave factories they're done they hate
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:45.480]  American freedom I mean it's so simple closing comments what do we do who do we
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.160]  call how do we stop this we get on board an alley pack dot us we call them on
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.360]  bar the Senate and Congress with calls against the bill but at the same time
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:57.120]  we need enough people volunteers and supporters to fully launch our candidate
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.960]  operations at 2014 now but these lawmakers like Lindsey Graham and Ted Poe
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.400]  and other people all of a sudden hear from people in their district hey
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:08.400]  Congressman Poe did you hear some guy named Danny Smith that's going to run
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:12.840]  against you because you now support MSP for legal members well what yeah he's
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.280]  already this is North American Union and and should they also call the committee
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:22.000]  should they call should they call the Judiciary Committee every member of
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.760]  Congress every member Senate and keep those calls rolling and intensify them
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:29.800]  spread the word on social media internet and talk radio and help us start
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.600]  finding candidates and yeah and I want to explain something to the gun lobby the
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.600]  NRA should be against amnesty because Mexico which is the main group of
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:43.480]  immigrants has no second amendment 90% the polls I've seen end up voting
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:47.480]  illegally or when they become citizens to take the guns well they will have
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.800]  trouble with some of their supporters if they try to dilute or change their
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.640]  issue alley pack Americans for legal immigration pack while we don't have the
[01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:58.800]  budget that the NRA does or the numbers just yet we are the NRA of illegal
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.240]  no no I know you are that's why you're on this but what I'm saying is is that we
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.840]  need NRA members to get it through their head folks this is yet this is North
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.960]  American Union they've done this in Europe they've done this in other areas
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.040]  they flood the country with people put them on welfare and then convert the
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.720]  country to socialism and the ultra-rich are then exempt from the taxes as is
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:24.000]  coming out in France and they they want authoritarianism this is a they're
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.440]  bringing in people that hate the predominant indigenous people of the
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.600]  United States of European and Christian descendancy types that are the type that
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:34.960]  have stopped the billionaires before stopped the banks before stopped the
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:38.920]  type of tyrannies before you're talking about the number one group of people that
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:42.960]  have enjoyed freedom and prosperity and world history here in the United States
[01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:47.840]  that are being targeted within well I'll say this I want to export liberty to all
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.800]  these countries and I found that we're able to wake people up but not if there's
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:55.640]  the language barrier and that's why the melting pot has been overloaded to do

[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:31.280]  Alex Jones here back live what William Gean which is talking about is true the
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:37.440]  real renaissance or Western Liberty coming out of Greece and then Rome and
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.680]  then of course Rome became corrupt no longer Republic and then in the dark
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:46.920]  ages than Europe has been the main driving force of liberty worldwide in
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:53.120]  the last 500 years but the ideas are what can be transferred but it's true
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.160]  these third world populations have been taught their own nationalism and by the
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.360]  media to racially identify while the United States has taught to be
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:07.160]  inclusive and not to identify but that was done not to create unity that was
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.720]  done to create Balkanization and compartmentalization you turn on NSNBC
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:18.200]  it is it is the total Democratic Party Ku Klux Klan hour but you know all whites
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:21.680]  are bad unless they submit to everything the new world order says that way you
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:26.320]  make political issues of open borders taking your guns socialist health care
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:31.560]  racial when it shouldn't be racial we're all human beings do you see that so
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:37.920]  they don't want to export freedom to other countries America now exports
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:42.600]  torture and corruption and government drug dealing to other countries and then
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.520]  they blame what's good about America for all of those problems when America has
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:52.240]  been captured why frankly the nano tech with genetic engineering all the
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:56.840]  craziness that's going on is gonna far outstrip this immigration issue in the
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:00.240]  future I mean they're gonna release bio weapons you name it they're gonna
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:05.960]  change things very very quickly I want freedom all over the world from Africa
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:11.800]  to Latin America to Europe to Asia to Australia to every Pacific Island I want
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:20.160]  humanity to you know have better goals and ideas of building a future but the
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:24.000]  globalists have an ugly view of humanity and they want to collectivize
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:29.080]  things not to even make you better but to dominate humanity and then reduce
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:37.160]  humanity's numbers sterilize the planet most the people bring in GMO I mean when
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.640]  I look at this plan it makes you believe in the devil because it's so wicked it's
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:47.560]  so destructive it's so bad even for the elite some kids and I don't see them
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:51.440]  getting away with it we're gonna start the next hour and I've got to get into

[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:22.920]  have a good time but you know what we need to pull back from this and just
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:26.360]  think we're alive one time are we really gonna let the worst elements of

[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.680]  I know you're all competing with each other and you're all scared to so you're
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:39.840]  just trying to jockey the operation so that you come out on top look you're
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:45.280]  not none of you are coming out on top and when something else I told a
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:50.000]  reporter about we go when everybody sells out there's there's not even any
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.560]  power in it even if you're a cynical bad person what do the devil say it's
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:02.960]  better to reign in hell than serve in heaven it's better to burn out than fade
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:05.640]  away
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:15.760]  but what if you're in hell what have you're in a system run by the devil it's
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:24.400]  better to reign in heaven than serve in hell that's another lie the devil you

[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:28.080]  issuance of money and credit that so they want to shut down production
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:33.920]  because that's what gives them real control it's not about money it's about
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:39.840]  power it's about domination it's about keeping us the little ants in line

[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:28.080]  classical stinking evil run rampant they're building FEMA camps they admit

[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:59.400]  those hydrogen bombs in the 60s in the upper atmosphere and then they had a
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:04.080]  plan to try to blow up the moon and then I have riders call me and go do you
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:08.240]  really believe they try to blow up the moon do you really believe that they
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:13.080]  that they detonated the US alone over a hundred hydrogen bombs in the upper
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:17.400]  atmosphere trying to blow up the Van Allen radiation belt to get spacecraft
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:21.200]  through it and I just go and I just I just look at the reporters down go no

[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:02.760]  story about it you got to see the video of your radio listener and and you know
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:05.980]  you go out to him and say we want Nazi Germany to take over America to take the
[02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:11.400]  guns for Obama. They go, oh, Nazis for Obama. Yeah, I'll sign that. Because, and then he
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.940]  talks to the guy and he goes, now you're sure about that. You want to ban the guns
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:19.200]  and put them, you know, arrest the gun owners and Nazi takeover. He goes, man, you don't
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:25.500]  have to convince me. I understand. He's like, he just looks at Mark like, because to that
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:30.260]  guy who has no power in his life, it sounds pretty powerful to lock people up in a camp.
[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:42.020]  I mean, that's sexy, man. I mean, these people are just pathetic begging to be overrun, begging.
[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:44.540]  Here's the problem, though. There are a large portion of us that are awake and know what's
[02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:48.660]  going on. And you can call us crazy all day. Yeah, we're crazy like a fox. We're crazy
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:52.900]  awake. Let's go to Mark Dyson's video. He's got one where they say, all of them say, ban
[02:15:52.900 --> 02:15:56.580]  the First Amendment. He goes, we're going to arrest the Tea Partyers and ban their First
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:16:00.620]  Amendment because they don't like Obama. And he used to be the boss and they go, yes, yes,
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:07.900]  I want to sign that. This is everyone in Southern California that he talks to, all of them.
[02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:13.420]  We go out in Austin. Let's ban water. Yes, ban water. Let's take everybody's guns. Yes,
[02:16:13.420 --> 02:16:20.260]  let's take everybody's guns because it's real simple. I'm trendy. We got to go out and say,
[02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:23.100]  hi. Well, I think we already did it. We got to edit it. I haven't seen the video yet.
[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:32.420]  I think they went out last week, did they? And shot a piece saying post birth abortion.
[02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:38.180]  For the earth, Obama wants to abort babies up to age three. I guarantee they're going
[02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:44.020]  to sign it. Oh, really? Abort babies for the earth? Let's go ahead now. You can't ever
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:51.500]  blame the Germans anymore, folks. People follow orders. You get a tyranny in, it's over. And
[02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:54.580]  they're trying to get it all in place right now. Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:59.580]  Take a quick look in your backpack, just checking for explosive materials in the wake of the
[02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:05.500]  Boston bombings. We're just making sure that nobody's carrying any harmful or potentially
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:12.140]  hazardous materials on campus. Okay, you're clear to go. Thank you so much for that. Take
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:15.820]  a quick look in your bag, make sure that you're not carrying any explosive materials in the
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:24.100]  wake of the Boston bombing. What is this for? Thank you for not being a sucker. Hey, sir,
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:27.660]  excuse me, sir, one second. Stop. Just need to take a quick look in your backpack, make
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:31.940]  sure we're not having any potentially hazardous or explosive materials in here. Are you serious?
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:37.180]  We're just part of the Obama citizen security volunteer force. Just in the wake of the Boston
[02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:41.260]  bombings, we can't be too sure this is a black backpack. Okay, you're clear to go, sir. Thank
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:47.860]  you. Wait, are you serious? No, we're just showing how suckers people are. They'll just
[02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:59.540]  sit and obey and willingly let their fourth amendment be violated. Excuse me, sir, just
[02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:03.060]  need to take a quick look in your bag for make sure there's no explosive material. Stop
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:06.940]  one second. Just need to make sure that there's no explosive materials in this bag or any
[02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:14.740]  explosive materials. That's enough. Full video up on info wars.com and Paul Watson's article.
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:19.940]  Californians let Obama domestic security force in quotes, search their bags. And then he
[02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:23.940]  goes out and does it on the boardwalk and the police come over and go, Well, I guess
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:30.100]  you're saying it's voluntary. So okay. But people don't like it when we do this. And
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:35.580]  again, they're in uniforms with a gun. And now in Austin, they are we're searching everybody's
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:42.260]  bags randomly on Lamar TSA feds out of their jurisdiction aren't even sworn police out
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:46.020]  there with Austin police searching and and then you say no to them. They're like, how
[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:53.700]  dare you say no to me? It's exactly the same deal. It's asinine. And we have another video
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:19:00.020]  I'll play some of coming up after the break where they sign petitions, every one of them
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:04.580]  to ban free speech. And they speak English. These are white guys, black guys, Hispanic
[02:19:04.580 --> 02:19:08.700]  you name it. I mean, they're like, Yeah, we're going to ban the Tea Party from their speech.
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:12.500]  Yeah. Yeah. And we're going to, you know, because you're not allowed to talk about Obama.
[02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:15.660]  I mean, he needs to totally run things. Now we're going to have authoritarianism. Now they're
[02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:20.940]  like, Oh, absolutely. They're like that. Yeah, people are causing a problem talking about
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:25.580]  Obama. Yeah, let's let's let's ban the First Amendment. Let's arrest them. And these are
[02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:31.820]  people having conversations, making eye contact, clearly audibly saying that they're going
[02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:38.620]  to do all of this. And California, they've they've won there. We're on the radio there.
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:46.180]  There's some good people up there. But California is going bankrupt. They love it. They're going
[02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:50.140]  to take the entire middle classes money and the ultra rich that are exempt are going to,
[02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:54.220]  of course, move out of California. And this is what they do everywhere. They're now got
[02:19:54.220 --> 02:20:00.220]  taxes above 75% in France. And the government on record is exempt. You heard me, they're
[02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:05.980]  exempt. Hey, there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item
[02:20:05.980 --> 02:20:11.180]  in a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun. But the
[02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:17.700]  correct answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals
[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:24.020]  a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:28.580]  this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth
[02:20:28.580 --> 02:20:33.820]  is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:37.620]  outside your door. But I have to tell you could literally make the difference between
[02:20:37.620 --> 02:20:43.820]  life and death for you and your family. Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the
[02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:49.120]  number one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video
[02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:53.060]  that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months. Go
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:59.220]  watch my video now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's

[02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:34.580]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:38.820]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:42.940]  to serve as debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:46.460]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:47.460]  country.
[02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:50.140]  Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary
[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:57.900]  system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.900 --> 02:22:58.900]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:04.420]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland? Did you know that mercury
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:08.620]  from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into
[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:13.460]  your body? Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally.
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:18.300]  Medical studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited
[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:22.060]  into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function. The number
[02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:26.260]  one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione. The number one
[02:23:26.260 --> 02:23:31.660]  superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione
[02:23:31.660 --> 02:23:37.180]  is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows. After investigating most high end whey
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:42.220]  proteins on the market, only one is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete
[02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:47.620]  and in our opinion the most powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey.
[02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:57.660]  It is One World Whey. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldwhey.com. That's

[02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:13.140]  Folks, I got a correction to make. I said Wells Fargo and McCovey have laundered 376 billion
[02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:18.020]  dollars in drug money over two years according to federal documents that Bloomberg covered.
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:23.780]  It's 378 billion. I always say 2 billion less for some reason. 378 billion. We're going
[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:28.060]  to show you that news article again in a moment. We showed it last hour. They were supplying
[02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:34.140]  the aircraft, the weapons, everything. We pulled up some of the news articles. I got
[02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:39.060]  an NRA piece that also gives it sources where the Mexican drug cartels get at least three
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:44.940]  quarters of their weapons they buy from the Mexican military or they buy that come in
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:51.820]  on international flights. A fully auto, grenade launchers, you name it. There it is. Banks
[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:58.820]  financing Mexico gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal. Who's Wells Fargo? It's Warren Buffett.
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:03.260]  Warren Buffett's the real gangster, folks. He makes Capone look like a schoolboy. Warren
[02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:09.980]  Buffett has gotten hundreds of billions of dollars. Look it up. Of bailout money. Just
[02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:17.260]  type Warren Buffett, biggest beneficiary of bailout. Now you've got to buy insurance
[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:24.940]  from him. That's why he's got record profits this year. He runs things. He's El Jefe. El
[02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:31.580]  Gordo. Warren Buffett, champion of bailout, also leading beneficiary, McClatchy News.
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:37.900]  So now you know. But document can please. Obama blames in Mexico days ago. We've been
[02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:48.780]  covering this. Obama blames U.S. gun owners. And I'll be honest with you. There are a lot
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:51.820]  of guns from the U.S. going into Mexico that weren't shipped there by Obama to blame the
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:55.300]  Second Amendment. And I say great. Criminals are going to have guns. Government's going
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:26:00.940]  to have guns anyways. I've seen the numbers. The semi-autos, the shotguns, the handguns.
[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:04.500]  Mexicans are getting them and taking them home to protect their families. And by the
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:09.700]  way, you can pull up the articles, Mexican vigilantes are restoring order in city after
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:15.620]  city. Vice News has covered it. You name it. So they hate it. Criminal Obama and the criminal
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:20.620]  drug cartels run by the CIA in many cases. That's come out in court. They hate it. So
[02:26:20.620 --> 02:26:24.620]  they hate the fact that the Mexicans are getting guns. I mean, what are they going to do if
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:29.260]  the Mexicans get guns to protect themselves? Then the cartels. See, the cartels will only
[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:33.700]  attack you most of the time if they think you're not armed. And they demand money off
[02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:38.980]  people to let their kids go to school safe. Even poor people, they're shaking down now.
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:44.340]  Mexico is totally imploded into a hell. And I say more power to the Mexican people to
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:50.100]  get guns and protect themselves. You know the answer to free Mexico? Give guns and firearms
[02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:55.620]  training to every family in Mexico, and the problems will be over very, very quickly.
[02:26:55.620 --> 02:26:58.500]  You look at China and places that are under hellish control, it's because they've taken
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:27:03.620]  the guns from the people. And only government has the guns. North Korea, you name it. Tyrants,
[02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:08.940]  hate guns. Let's go ahead. They hate guns in your hands. Let's go to this NRAP. It's
[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:10.820]  breaking it down. Here it is.
[02:27:10.820 --> 02:27:16.660]  You don't care about your laws here. We can get weapons anywhere. We get weapons from
[02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:19.460]  Honduras and El Salvador.
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:23.060]  Majority of the weapons are not coming from the U.S. Three quarters of the weapons that
[02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:29.220]  the cartel gets is supplied by the military.
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:35.340]  Training in Mexico is not a problem. It's an institution.
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:39.140]  It's a business for the government, for the military, and for the cartels. Why would you
[02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:44.780]  stop the business when it's working so well?
[02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:51.100]  The worst of their society coming here to America to prey upon our innocent citizens.
[02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:52.540]  And this isn't a problem.
[02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.460]  The federal government has abandoned this.
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:56.900]  Do I think the border is secure? Hell no.
[02:27:56.900 --> 02:28:00.220]  We've been driving down this border road here for about ten miles. Have you seen a
[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:03.460]  Border Patrol agent yet? The Border Patrol is not on the border.
[02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:06.900]  I know that border, I think, as well as anyone.
[02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:13.380]  We turn on the TV and Janet Napolitano says it is as secure now as it has ever been.
[02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:14.380]  Not my question.
[02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:15.500]  Senator, please.
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:18.260]  In my opinion, it's borderline treason.
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:23.020]  This traffic through here unstoppable. The agents, we don't have enough.
[02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:27.620]  Oh, absolutely. I carry a gun everywhere I go.
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:31.540]  We're looking at human smuggling, drugs, terrorists coming across our property.
[02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:35.300]  From Syria, from Iran, from Turkey, from China.
[02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:39.460]  My wife comes home from the grocery store and a woman's head is in the front yard.
[02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:42.980]  Is this America or is this Iraq?
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:48.340]  National security should not be a political game and these jokers make it just that.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:55.100]  For us and my family, our safe haven has been destroyed and that is unforgivable and I don't
[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:58.260]  know how this government is ever going to give that back to you.
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:02.060]  To slap in the face of the citizens of this great country of ours, to slap in the face
[02:29:02.060 --> 02:29:04.740]  of the people that have fought for this flag that we represent.
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:10.420]  I fear for my grandchildren what they are going to be left with. It's our right to being
[02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:13.260]  stripped on a day-to-day basis.
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:21.500]  Angry? You betcha. Surprise? No. No president who has the best interest of this nation as
[02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:27.140]  a nation as it was created with effort, effort to do something like this.
[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:34.220]  These guys ought to be criminally tried for what they're doing in this nation.
[02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:40.140]  Everything we love about America, all the freedoms our forefathers fought for, all of
[02:29:40.140 --> 02:29:42.460]  it is under attack by Barack Obama.
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:43.460]  No kidding.
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.100]  So pass this story along, then join the NRA.
[02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:50.820]  Absolutely. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:54.540]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:06.540]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:11.180]  good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:15.420]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:20.820]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:25.900]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:31.140]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and
[02:32:31.140 --> 02:32:35.620]  discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real

[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:32.700]  Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:08.700]  Ministry bringing us in. Oh yeah. Man, I tell you, anybody who says they're bored because
[02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:13.020]  they watch TV all day in the false culture, if you're awake folks, you're not bored.
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:20.500]  The world, the technological developments, the good, the bad, the incredible things unfolding,
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:24.820]  the unspeakable things going on. I haven't even gotten into Benghazi and I really should.
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:28.940]  The hearings are amara. The indication we're getting from the Republicans is they're going
[02:34:28.940 --> 02:34:35.540]  to try to score some political points but actually not do anything because they're the ones with
[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:42.380]  Obama saying attack Syria, use al-Qaeda against them. They're all up to it in their eyeballs.
[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:47.860]  So they'll criticize Obama for not giving support to the ambassador and letting al-Qaeda
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:54.500]  kill them when the State Department hired the al-Qaeda group, brought them in to overthrow
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:58.980]  Libya and that was the group they hired for security at the safe house and the weapons
[02:34:58.980 --> 02:35:04.300]  cache down the street. They had a big military torture center. Again, Obama's continuing
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:10.420]  the torture and it's just an example of there is no Democratic Party. There is no Republican
[02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:15.460]  Party at the top. There are a bunch of crooks but the mainline Republicans and the Democrats
[02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:20.340]  are all attacking the proto Tea Party that came out of Ron Paul, myself and others. That's
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:26.220]  the group they're going after. Constitutionalist because the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
[02:35:26.220 --> 02:35:32.980]  the Declaration of Independence, common sense and not laying down to tyranny, being uppity
[02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:39.580]  sits incontrovertibly against them. There aren't many populations that won't put up
[02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:46.900]  with being slaves. The Afghans won't do it. There are areas of Africa where people never
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:52.300]  really been totally taken over. There are a few areas of Mexico where nobody's been
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:58.220]  able to take over. Areas of Chiapas and things because it's really just natives down there.
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:03.500]  It's like Native Americans who are still down there. Pretty much the same thing as the Comanches
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:07.820]  or something. Everybody else is being assimilated and taken over by the globalist corporate
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:14.540]  board and bottom line here, ladies and gentlemen, is the new world order is not taking us over
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:18.100]  to make us civilized and bring us into the future. They're doing exactly what was done
[02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:23.820]  to natives in this country. Put you on a reservation, use bioweapons against you. Use cultural
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:29.180]  death against you. Overwrite and destroy your culture. This is what the globalists are doing.
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:34.060]  The globalists have their culture. It's psychopathic control of society, the destruction of the
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:43.780]  family, medical tyranny. So we're going to get into eyewitness the Zarnab brother, the
[02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:48.220]  one still alive did not shoot Boston cough. It was friendly fire and Watson goes into
[02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:51.540]  all the other examples of where they've done friendly fire and tried to frame people for
[02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:58.980]  it. Very powerful. That's in mainstream news. Cop must have known a little too much and
[02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:02.420]  our cops knew too much and then can, I mean, the whole thing's a cover up. It's not just
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:07.980]  that. You add it all together. Also, West providing chemical weapons is Syria. That's
[02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:12.580]  coming out mainstream news. We're getting to that. We've got a little bit on the Benghazi,
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:17.420]  but, but, but Lindsey Graham and others are like, this is really the damn breaking. That's
[02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:23.580]  how you lie to somebody. You know, it's like, um, you bust in with some guy in bed with
[02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:27.940]  your wife and he says, Oh, this is the damn breaking. You've really, I'm going to, I'm
[02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:32.180]  going to come clean for you right now. I'm going to admit everything. You're like, Oh,
[02:37:32.180 --> 02:37:39.660]  really? You are? Yes. I was, I'm a, I'm a gynecologist tonight. I dropped by here tonight to do a
[02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:44.140]  medical checkup on it for free. Cause I just want to be a friend. I mean, I mean, I mean,
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:48.780]  that's what Lindsey Graham's doing. He's like, now I got the dams breaking here. There was
[02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:54.340]  total systematic failure and stand down for eight hours on accident. Obama, you did a
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:57.940]  terrible job. We're going to give the state department more diplomatic funding and more
[02:37:57.940 --> 02:38:03.380]  security funding. How dare you? And Obama will say, I could have done a better job.
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:09.180]  You're right. Not. Well, we hired all kind of to run security and we ordered to stand
[02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:12.860]  down for eight hours while they killed everybody inside. So there wouldn't be any witnesses
[02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:18.540]  that we gave them 10,000 heat seeking missiles. Cause we're planning to use those on the West
[02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:23.900]  to bring in martial law. And so yeah, we killed the ambassador. You bet we did. And we'll do
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:28.980]  it again if we need to. No, no, you don't want the public to know that. And it may have
[02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:33.020]  been a neocon double cross. Some of my experts think that might have even happened. And there
[02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:37.980]  was a group was in there that told Obama just keeps sleeping. I don't know. Cause all these
[02:38:37.980 --> 02:38:42.020]  Democrats making about Obama, there's no way he do that. There's no way he. Oh, really,
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:45.740]  when they bomb a couple of hundred people and kill them to kill one bad guy, they call
[02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:51.620]  it collateral damage. They will kill people all day, including each other. Don't you people
[02:38:51.620 --> 02:38:56.380]  get it? Charity isn't sexy. It's not cool. It's not fun. I want to go to our guest, Judy
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:00.940]  Powell. And they're, they're voting on this today in the committee. And this is being
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:06.580]  passed all over the country. Ladies and gentlemen, she's the co-founder communications director.
[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:11.180]  You should get her on sometime in studio on CPS, the battles she's been through with parents
[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:14.700]  because it's mainly middle class people. They haunt your kids because they get top dollar
[02:39:14.700 --> 02:39:20.660]  from them, um, from the, uh, adoption houses. Just like in China, the fall on gong that only
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:26.380]  eat organic at exercise have the best organs. And so they, they type, they, they blood type
[02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:30.140]  them, genetic type them and keep them there in their prison cell, exercise them, feed
[02:39:30.140 --> 02:39:34.900]  them well until an American wants an organ or say you don't ask where it's coming from.
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:39.780]  I'm, I'm so, so, so they're warehousing our kids. That's a separate issue. But, uh, here
[02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:53.300]  is the bill document can please, uh, the bill, uh, is HB 1340. The bill is HB 1340 and Judy
[02:39:53.300 --> 02:40:00.220]  Powell, uh, joins us. She heads up parent guidance center.org. And they're trying to
[02:40:00.220 --> 02:40:05.100]  pass it in the Texas house. Uh, here is the bill right here. The bill will allow minors,
[02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:10.380]  14 age or older to consent to their own immunization. Unless the medical provider has knowledge
[02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:14.500]  that child's parent or guardian has expressly refused to give consent to see all over the
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:17.780]  country. They're giving kids shots as young as five without parental consent and saying
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:22.820]  it's an accident. They didn't know California made it down to age 11. Now, can you, can
[02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:26.620]  your 14 year old give consent to have sex with maybe the principal principal was like,
[02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:31.660]  hey, your 14 year old wanted it, you know, uh, one of the drugs, you know, uh, you know,
[02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:34.340]  that's why they sell drugs to kids or give it to them free to get them addicted. And
[02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:39.060]  then say, now go take money out of your mom's purse and bring it to me. And then nobody
[02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:43.820]  bust them cause he's paying the cops off. Uh, and so there you go. And the bill gets
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:47.580]  even worse in its language. And the next, they're also trying to get abortion without
[02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:51.900]  parental consent. Hey, you know, you're, you're, you're in California, you're 11 year
[02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:57.820]  old needs a, uh, letter to go to the planetarium or the zoo, but not to get an abortion or
[02:40:57.820 --> 02:41:02.900]  get shot up with deadly vaccines that the insert says can kill them. So Judy pal fighting
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:07.140]  this valiantly as a citizen activist right down there at the Capitol right now as he
[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:11.540]  joins us from the Capitol, uh, Judy, uh, thank you for joining us. Uh, tell us the latest
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:15.100]  on this bill and the phone numbers and who we need to call and what we need to do right
[02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:16.100]  now.
[02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:20.500]  Uh, well, the latest is going to the house for today. We're thinking maybe in a couple
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:23.780]  hours. Oh, it's already out of committee. Oh my God. It's out of committee. Yeah. It's
[02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:29.380]  going to a four vote right now today. It's on the calendar for today. So we need people
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:35.260]  to call their local representative and, and in the house side and tell them vote against
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:40.620]  HD 1340. That would be the best thing for everyone to do. Doesn't it show how criminal
[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:43.900]  the government is? They're shooting kids up everywhere and telling them it's the law
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:48.660]  and don't tell your parents and then they're being caught doing this all over the place.
[02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:52.420]  And so now their answer is just say no more parental consent. I mean, this is, this is
[02:41:52.420 --> 02:41:57.460]  unprecedented. Right. Exactly. And we feel like this bill is usurping parental authority
[02:41:57.460 --> 02:42:01.980]  and kind of going around the normal medical process. And it's really about probably the
[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:07.100]  HPV vaccine because a lot of these vaccines are required to get into school and children
[02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:12.580]  know that. So say they're sitting at the doctor's office on a sick visit and the doctor introduces
[02:42:12.580 --> 02:42:16.820]  some vaccine that's not required to get into school. They're not going to know the difference.
[02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:20.420]  And so they're going to say, sure, yeah, I want to be saved from cancer or whatever,
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:24.100]  you know, the doctor is talking at the time. Oh, yeah. It's like, hey, we don't have to
[02:42:24.100 --> 02:42:28.820]  even go grab kids from CPS now and test stuff on them. We can just do it with your kids.
[02:42:28.820 --> 02:42:32.820]  Exactly. And like you said earlier, you know, they're not capable of consent with the specs.
[02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:36.820]  They're not capable. We don't let a 14 year old, you know, drink alcohol. They can't
[02:42:36.820 --> 02:42:40.620]  even go to the school nurse without oversight. You know, they have a headache. They can't
[02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:44.420]  even take an aspirin without the nurse looking over their shoulders. Yeah, we're going to
[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:48.380]  have them consent to be immunization. We'll see that's the that's the next phase of parents
[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:54.060]  can't even give their kids a Tylenol. It's only the school only they can only they have
[02:42:54.060 --> 02:43:00.740]  the power. Sorry, go ahead. And so I mean, it's just expanding government authority
[02:43:00.740 --> 02:43:05.500]  over, of course, with the federal healthcare act going through, we think it has a lot to
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:12.260]  do with that. And so they're trying to get more and more kids into these hospital homes
[02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:17.620]  or the medical home, whatever they want to call it, and you serve the parental authority.
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:23.620]  And then this bill is specifically the most disturbing part is if your child does consent,
[02:43:23.620 --> 02:43:27.900]  it has a clause that says the health care provider or facility is not liable for the
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:32.580]  immunization of the child under this section, except for the providers or facilities own
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:37.620]  acts of negligence, which we already know in the vaccine industry that pharmaceutical
[02:43:37.620 --> 02:43:42.620]  companies are immune from prosecution. And so we have a bill here that says if we go
[02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:47.060]  ahead without your parental authority and vaccinate your kid and something happens,
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:53.060]  gee, I'm sorry, Johnny died. We're not responsible. And so that's the most disturbing part of
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:58.700]  the bill, I think. If I, you know, putting a 14 year old consent, how they try to cover
[02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:05.220]  themselves in the bill by saying that they already have on file that a parent has consented
[02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:11.820]  to medical treatment. But medical treatment, in our opinion, is very different than immunization.
[02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:17.140]  And immunization is a choice. Medical treatment says, you know, sure, if your arm is broken,
[02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:21.580]  reset it. If you're in an emergency situation, resuscitate. I can't think of any instance
[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:26.580]  that we have an immunization that's going to save a kid's life. So they say that if
[02:44:26.580 --> 02:44:30.340]  you've consented to this medical treatment, then you've already consented. But that's
[02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:34.940]  a very different thing in the immunization world because so far, many states, we still
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:39.020]  have a choice for religious exemptions or philosophical.
[02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:42.420]  Absolutely. Now, is there a general number? Because every time I try to find numbers,
[02:44:42.420 --> 02:44:45.660]  there's numbers for each person. I'll put them back on screen. Should we call the speaker
[02:44:45.660 --> 02:44:50.340]  of the house or who was most, because people will say, give us a number. If people are
[02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:54.900]  so lazy, they won't even find the number or type in Texas State House contacts. You can
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:59.860]  find out, email them. Because again, I should have dug these numbers up before you got here.
[02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:03.340]  Do you have those numbers in front of you? Or do you have a general switchboard number?
[02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:04.980]  Unfortunately, I don't.
[02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:10.300]  I go through this every year. So when I end up going over the Texas State House, I never,
[02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:14.460]  I'm going to hang on the wall next time. Of course, they change numbers sometimes too,
[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:18.140]  so that we can do that. But of course, they try to hide the numbers as well. When you put
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:22.180]  it back on screen, I'll just hand give these out individually to everybody out there on
[02:45:22.180 --> 02:45:23.900]  the radio. We'll punch that back up.
[02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:28.540]  The best thing to do is find your address. Like if you go to the regular site and you
[02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:33.320]  type in your address and you find your representative, because representatives listen to their constituent
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:39.860]  specifically. So if you go to the main site, it has an area that says, who is my representative?
[02:45:39.860 --> 02:45:44.020]  And you can click on that and you put in your home address and that, I don't keep track
[02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:45.660]  of that. I mean, as far as we know, right?
[02:45:45.660 --> 02:45:51.460]  Sure. You go to TexasDirectory.com and they've got all the up-to-date numbers for each member.
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:55.500]  But again, and if you're listening in New Mexico, you're listening in Maine, they are
[02:45:55.500 --> 02:46:00.580]  trying to pass this and are passing this everywhere. In some cases, children as young
[02:46:00.580 --> 02:46:08.220]  as 11 and it overthrows common law, common sense. Did you see MSNBC officially in ads
[02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:11.340]  now say that the state basically owns your children?
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:14.660]  No, no, I didn't see that.
[02:46:14.660 --> 02:46:16.660]  I'm sorry, your phone's breaking up.
[02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:20.860]  I've been up at the Capitol 24-7, so I have not seen NBC.
[02:46:20.860 --> 02:46:25.300]  Well, no, no, I mean, this happened a while back. It's just that they're getting more
[02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:26.300]  bold.
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:27.300]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:31.300]  So, so do you know how many votes they have? I mean, is it a close voter? What's going
[02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:32.300]  on?
[02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:37.340]  We don't know yet. I mean, it's just going to be a general vote. We are working with
[02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:42.260]  some other groups that have blanketed the Capitol with some fliers at some possible
[02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:47.700]  point, like the Home School Coalition, the Texas Home School Coalition, also the National
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:55.020]  Vaccine Information Center. A local Texas vaccine group is parents requesting open
[02:46:55.020 --> 02:47:03.700]  vaccine education, P-R-O-V-E proof. They've been working hard on it. But the other side
[02:47:03.700 --> 02:47:07.460]  is very strong. They've got more money. All of us are working, you know, we're volunteers.
[02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:11.020]  And so the other side is coming from, you know, the doctors and the hospitals and the
[02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:15.020]  pharmaceutical companies. They have a lot of money that they put into these vaccination
[02:47:15.020 --> 02:47:16.020]  campaigns.
[02:47:16.020 --> 02:47:20.620]  So, and they skew out a lot of, you know, dangerous, scary statistics to these representatives.
[02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:24.500]  And I think that the representatives, they have a good heart a lot of times and want
[02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:31.100]  to do the right thing. But I think that they're kind of wild and, and lose, you know, bamboozled
[02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:37.260]  by the statistics. We don't have an HPV epidemic going on in our state where, you know, girls
[02:47:37.260 --> 02:47:41.780]  are just dropping dead from cancer because they didn't get their HPV vaccine. We have
[02:47:41.780 --> 02:47:46.700]  no numbers like that proving that we have people dying, you know, by the millions of
[02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:48.700]  from the flu or any of these other vaccines.
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:53.620]  They give people 20 times the vaccines they did in the 50s. They're filled with every
[02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:58.220]  horrible thing. The UN's been caught adding steroids to it on record. Anybody can look
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:03.580]  it up. This government with its history of secret experimentation cannot be trusted to
[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:04.580]  do anything.
[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:09.540]  So everybody in Texas who doesn't want to have their kids forcibly inoculated because
[02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:14.020]  that's what they do. They convince them, oh, you want the shot. You want the lollipop.
[02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:15.020]  I mean, this is just amazing.
[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:20.020]  And I was afraid of my doctor. Kids are like, okay, this is the doctor. He must know best.
[02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:25.020]  So you're going to do whatever the doctor, I mean, it's a sorority problem here. You're
[02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:30.020]  going to put this kid under his sorority that they don't understand that they have a choice.
[02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:36.100]  No, exactly. It lets the government bully your child into doing whatever they want. I
[02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:40.620]  mean, government, government sets up checkpoints now and searches everyone's bags illegally
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:46.140]  with guys in uniforms and guns. Now, have you seen the force inoculations they've done
[02:48:46.140 --> 02:48:50.380]  in like Maryland where they have the police and riot gear and barking dogs and say it's
[02:48:50.380 --> 02:48:57.140]  the law when it's not. And in a giant exercise of brute fraud, they give them the injections.
[02:48:57.140 --> 02:49:02.740]  And this is the level that they start at. They start with kind of a low level coercion
[02:49:02.740 --> 02:49:06.620]  kind of under people's noses. It's for your own good. And then they're just going to work
[02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:12.980]  up from there. The next step would be requiring these vaccines and then taking away our choice.
[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:19.020]  A bunch of states are doing that now. Yes. Right. We don't want Texas to be one of them.
[02:49:19.020 --> 02:49:24.340]  And so if we fight back now, see the law that passed in California that let children consent
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:29.260]  to immunizations was specifically for STD. Now, of course, we're opposed to that as well.
[02:49:29.260 --> 02:49:35.900]  But this law in Texas, 1340 is more expensive. It does not say just for STD. It just says
[02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:40.380]  for immunization period. So that's going to be any immunization they want to give our
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:46.180]  kids. We need to stop it. And I think people have the power to stop it. They don't know
[02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:51.660]  that they have the power. The representative is listening. When you start barting their
[02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:57.580]  offices with phone calls, they listen and they get afraid to vote for something that's
[02:49:57.580 --> 02:50:02.300]  bad. And they pull back on it. And that's what we need today.
[02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:06.660]  But the American people are so passive now. That's why we become so enslaved. Texas is
[02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:11.740]  still free to a great extent because people are instinctively wary of government. But
[02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:16.380]  Austin has been colonized by Californians. A lot of them are my friends, but people fling
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:21.060]  California. But now the second wave are here saying this is California. I've actually had
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:26.380]  Californians tell me that, oh, you're one of those Texans. We're going to show you and
[02:50:26.380 --> 02:50:29.500]  it's like, oh, my God, you're going to show me. I mean, it's just bizarre.
[02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:35.580]  Yes, please don't bring your California law. We're all in trouble.
[02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:39.460]  It's just it's like a cult, man. It's a cult. All right. Well, you're doing great work over
[02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:44.220]  there at parent guidance center dot org. Everybody should check it out. Judy Powell will get you
[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:48.140]  in studio sometime with good audio. Great job down there at the Capitol. We'll see what
[02:50:48.140 --> 02:50:52.020]  happens with this fight. Anything else? Thanks a lot for doing what you do, Alex.
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:55.860]  Thank you. That's one of my wife's friends. Great lady. All right, we'll be right back.

[02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:11.180]  Outside the Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald
[02:52:11.180 --> 02:52:15.620]  Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[02:52:15.620 --> 02:52:21.220]  president could obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:25.740]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved

[02:53:03.180 --> 02:53:07.760]  change? Do you lose sleep over what could happen to your assets and hard-earned money?
[02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:11.980]  Are you looking for a better way of life with more freedom, security, and asset protection?
[02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:16.060]  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you should consider investing in the country
[02:53:16.060 --> 02:53:21.780]  of Belize. Belize is an independent English-speaking country only hours from the U.S. with strong
[02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:26.920]  banking and asset protection laws. In fact, Belize is one of the last tax havens left

[02:53:52.980 --> 02:53:59.980]  That's 800-793-2600. Again, 800-793-2600.
[02:53:59.980 --> 02:54:06.980]  You know what I'm doing? I'm just desperately trying to get you to think, get you to take
[02:54:17.980 --> 02:54:22.980]  action, get you to stand up and say no to the new world order. And I'm asking our listeners
[02:54:22.980 --> 02:54:29.980]  who are great active people that love liberty to reach out to their friends and family and
[02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:35.740]  really alert people. And I am seeing more and more signs that people are getting awake,
[02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:41.980]  are getting involved, but now is the time to be as aggressive as possible. I mean, if
[02:54:41.980 --> 02:54:47.540]  the government can publicly use al-Qaeda against Libya and Syria while taking our rights because
[02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:52.460]  of the al-Qaeda threat, you know you're in trouble. If Congress can be having hearings
[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:56.100]  about, they've already begun to take federal pension funds, they've already spent them.
[02:54:56.100 --> 02:54:59.860]  You're still getting fiat checks, but the money's gone. That's been given to foreign
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:06.860]  banks. If they can take pension funds, I mean, my God, you're talking about the end of society
[02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:13.020]  as we know it, the end of confidence in the system. I have so many reporters say to me,
[02:55:13.020 --> 02:55:17.500]  Alex, you're going to destroy confidence in America. America's being destroyed by the
[02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:24.140]  globalists, they're destroying the confidence. My confidence, my reliance is on common sense
[02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:28.820]  because history has shown any government big enough to give you anything you want will
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:35.820]  take everything you've got. That's just the way the world works. Look how jealous and
[02:55:36.220 --> 02:55:41.220]  envious and non-sharing the average person is, even if they're not a bad person. People
[02:55:41.220 --> 02:55:47.900]  just cannot share. I have done probably 10 different media deals with people over the
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:54.900]  years, financing films, you name it, and in no case did they ever pay unless I controlled
[02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:01.500]  the money. Everyone that's done business with me has been paid exactly what they were owed
[02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:08.500]  or more. Every other person I've worked with would not pay me and would destroy a relationship
[02:56:08.500 --> 02:56:15.500]  because they couldn't give people the money. Hollywood, even big shows like Doomsday Preppers,
[02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:19.580]  they don't have paid crew now on them. They have all these Hollywood people and camera
[02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:24.460]  folks who will work for free. It's the same thing with a lot of the people that do roadie
[02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:28.300]  work and stuff. Used to get paid a lot, then it was paid a little, then it's okay, we'll
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:31.940]  work for free for a while to prove you'll do it. I'm going to talk about some college,
[02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:37.500]  yeah, work for a t-shirt. I'm not talking about people that have never been a roadie
[02:56:37.500 --> 02:56:42.460]  that don't know sound, that don't know light. I mean good people. That's a race to the bottom.
[02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:47.420]  That's not building a culture. That's not building a civilization. The globalists are
[02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:51.780]  totally cutthroat, folks. You can build a true free market of excellence where people
[02:56:51.780 --> 02:56:58.780]  demand better and better and you build a civilization. We're going the opposite direction and everyone
[02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:05.420]  knows this and then I think about secret geoengineering programs partially declassified and just
[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:12.420]  the sci-fi-ness of what we're in and who knows what we don't know about. The average bureaucrat,
[02:57:12.780 --> 02:57:17.060]  the average even billionaire, the average senator doesn't even know what's going on.
[02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:22.500]  This, because it's so complex, even though it's all public, most of it, no one even
[02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:26.700]  in power will look at it because they're too busy doing their specialized job to go have
[02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:32.700]  sex with their mistress or go play golf or go to a gala and be a narcissist and wave
[02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:38.100]  at people. I mean that's what they're into. I am into how the world really works. I am
[02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:43.500]  immersed in what's going on and I have the quasi-photographic memory of the years to
[02:57:43.500 --> 02:57:50.500]  be able to integrate it and the historical lens and now I can report to you that it wasn't
[02:57:50.740 --> 02:57:57.420]  hard. This stuff is hiding in plain view at point blank range. We'll cover the Benghazi
[02:57:57.420 --> 02:58:01.100]  hearings tomorrow and we'll get into everything the police have confirmed in England that
[02:58:01.100 --> 02:58:05.860]  yes, Bilderberg is there this year. I'm going. Everybody needs to be there. There's incredible
