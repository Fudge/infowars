[00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:52.038]  We're about to go to our guest, Ray McGovern, a 26-year senior analyst
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:11.632]  Uh, at the Central Intelligence Agency, personally advised Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and others, and, uh, he's part of an organization that's trying to bring some sanity to all of this, and I found his, his, his research, his, his historical understanding, uh, to be very, very, uh, accurate from my research.
[00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:12.893]  That's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:19.557]  I've got quite a few questions for him, and I know we've got a bunch of callers on this subject of Saddam and the rest of it, so we'll get to you, too.
[00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:20.798]  Before I go to Mr. McGovern,
[00:01:21.622 --> 00:01:23.423]  I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:24.464]  I've made ten films.
[00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:26.846]  My tenth film, Matrix of Evil, is out.

[00:02:58.714 --> 00:02:59.715]  Take action.
[00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:10.062]  Ray McGovern, I was going to join him yesterday, he did briefly, he had to go as part of an emergency meeting or something, something he had to take care of with a program he does for inner-city kids.
[00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:14.805]  He does join us today here for the next 25 minutes or so.
[00:03:14.805 --> 00:03:19.068]  Mr. McGovern, just in a nutshell,
[00:03:19.588 --> 00:03:21.689]  Well, it's good to be back, Alex.
[00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:22.350]  Thank you for inviting me.
[00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.653]  It's a complex story, and I'll try to be brief.
[00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:55.397]  Back in the 80s, of course, we had just escaped from the trauma of having all those U.S.
[00:03:55.397 --> 00:03:58.520]  diplomats and others hold up in the U.S.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.341]  Embassy in Iran.
[00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:11.549]  And so the Iranians were our primary, quote, enemy, end quote, in those days, and certainly we didn't want any of the Iranians to be expanding their power still more.
[00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:15.594]  And so Saddam Hussein was seen as a counterweight to that.
[00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:20.416]  And so he became a bad guy, but he became our bad guy.
[00:04:20.416 --> 00:04:22.257]  Sort of like Noriega and Panama.
[00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:26.500]  There's a difference between other guys, bad guys, and our bad guys, okay?
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:38.006]  So we supported Saddam Hussein during his war with Iran to the point of exchanging very sensitive intelligence with him, which gave him the upper hand.
[00:04:39.484 --> 00:04:49.733]  We also did all kinds of things in terms of allowing sensitive materials to get to Iraq.
[00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:56.659]  Those materials later criticized as being precursors to chemical and biological weapons.
[00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.685]  Well, the 1994 Senate report says anthrax, botulism, West Nile as well.
[00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:03.686]  That's exactly right.
[00:05:04.463 --> 00:05:12.755]  And so it's quite hypocritical, since we knew that he was using nerve gas, for example, against the Iranians.
[00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:19.886]  And those years, all of a sudden, we turn around after supporting him in that, after saying nothing about it, essentially.
[00:05:20.938 --> 00:05:27.003]  Then all of a sudden he becomes an imminent danger, not only to his neighbors, but to us.
[00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:29.945]  And that's after his real capability has been blown to bits.
[00:05:29.945 --> 00:05:33.327]  I mean, they could say he was dangerous in 90, but not after 91.
[00:05:33.327 --> 00:05:42.314]  I mean, I hear him on the news going, he attacked Iran, he came to power in 79, he's a vicious killer.
[00:05:42.314 --> 00:05:47.698]  Didn't our government, basically back in 54, use him as a CIA assassin?
[00:05:48.436 --> 00:05:59.118]  Well, I'm told, I don't know this officially, but I'm told that our government did support his consolidation of power, and that seems pretty clear from the historical record.
[00:05:59.918 --> 00:06:13.166]  But the whole thing is the background here, and it relates to your other question, Alex, when you question how we can possibly allow a free and unfettered trial of this fellow.
[00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:24.053]  And that's going to be a real problem for our administration, because if Saddam Hussein is allowed to say all the things he could say, it will be very damning to U.S.
[00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:25.234]  policy going back
[00:06:26.034 --> 00:06:31.036]  Going back into the 80s, and it will show that it's been a very two-faced policy.
[00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:40.241]  Well, the Israelis at the Debka file, mainly Mossad folks, say he looked like he'd been held for weeks, if not months, and that he'd been worked over pretty bad.
[00:06:40.241 --> 00:06:45.843]  And then we have Congressman McDermott saying that, and that he's attacked as partisan.
[00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:51.186]  But then I have another congressman here, LaHood, Ray LaHood, on December 2nd,
[00:06:52.827 --> 00:07:00.274]  I know something you don't know, we're about to give you Saddam, so what do you think is really going on here?
[00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:04.618]  Yeah, I found LaHood's comments really intriguing.
[00:07:04.618 --> 00:07:11.205]  He sits on the Intelligence Committee in the Congress, and so he has access to some of this information.
[00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:17.668]  I don't have a definitive judgment on this, but it is intriguing indeed.
[00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:30.331]  Well, how can they say that McDermott is an evil communist traitor, as the neocons are now saying, for saying something that Frank said in Cigar Aficionado in the December issue, the head of CENTCOM, saying something that LaHood said?
[00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:31.111]  Yeah.
[00:07:31.111 --> 00:07:33.432]  Well, you know, this business of name-calling,
[00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:53.309]  When people call General Vinnie, for example, who headed the CENTCOM troops, when they call him a Marine General, highly decorated, when they call him a traitor of some kind, and now they call other people traitors, I mean, that just shows the depths to which the discussion has degenerated.
[00:07:53.309 --> 00:08:00.111]  Now, take Congressman, the one from Washington you just mentioned.
[00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:00.491]  McDermott.
[00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:01.251]  McDermott, yeah.
[00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:08.824]  He was over there, you may recall, he was over there in the fall of 2002, okay?
[00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:20.815]  And I remember Joyce Stephanopoulos asking him live on his program, Congressman McDermott, do you think that the President would deceive the American people?
[00:08:22.086 --> 00:08:26.530]  And Congressman McDermott smiled and he said, of course I do.
[00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:35.897]  And George Stephanopoulos sort of gulped, and I could hear the TV rooms in my rather affluent neighborhood, I could hear the gasps going off, like that.
[00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:38.079]  And of course then McDermott said, you know,
[00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:43.790]  Deceiving the American people is a bipartisan activity.
[00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.354]  Think of how Lyndon Johnson deceived the American people.
[00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:50.116]  And so don't be surprised.
[00:08:50.116 --> 00:09:00.545]  Just be aware that any time a president decides to go to war, which Bush had already decided three months previous, any time a US president decides to go to war,
[00:09:01.317 --> 00:09:04.660]  Then you cannot really expect that you'll get the full story.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:21.572]  Well, look at all the lies we've seen about fake news articles posted by the Pentagon, signed by troops that never saw it, Jessica Lynch fables, Niger uranium deals that didn't exist, mobile weapons trucks they knew day one were British sold trucks for pumping up hot air balloons.
[00:09:21.572 --> 00:09:23.574]  I mean, they knew all this.
[00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:25.956]  And how can we believe anything they say?
[00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:28.499]  I've never seen lies at this level.
[00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:32.984]  And I cut my teeth, Mr. McGovern, exposing Bill Clinton.
[00:09:32.984 --> 00:09:34.987]  I have never seen a wall of lies.
[00:09:34.987 --> 00:09:35.607]  Have you?
[00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:36.008]  Like this?
[00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:37.730]  Well, I have not.
[00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.732]  And let me just add to that, Alex.
[00:09:39.732 --> 00:09:41.734]  And I go back a ways.
[00:09:41.734 --> 00:09:44.738]  I came on in government when John F. Kennedy was president.
[00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.792]  So I saw LBJ and I saw Nixon and I saw all the rest of them.
[00:09:49.792 --> 00:09:53.333]  And there was a lot of duplicity and there were a lot of lies.
[00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:54.773]  And why are you now speaking up?
[00:09:54.773 --> 00:10:05.697]  I saw you on a British interview saying, saying compared to Scowcroft and Bush and the senior, the people running the White House now are quote, crazies.
[00:10:05.697 --> 00:10:10.279]  Yeah, well now that's a different, that phrase goes back to the 80s.
[00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:15.084]  Let me just tell you the difference between now and then with respect to the lies.
[00:10:15.084 --> 00:10:30.741]  I have never seen such a well-orchestrated, the epitome of PR proficiency, campaign going for 18 months as they prepared for this war.
[00:10:31.602 --> 00:10:38.745]  You see, the other lies, the lie about the Gulf of Tonkin, well that was sort of a spur of the moment opportunity as LBJ saw it.
[00:10:38.745 --> 00:10:43.407]  I don't excuse that, but it's a different kind of concern.
[00:10:43.407 --> 00:10:53.150]  What we had over the last 18 months was a concerted campaign, extremely well planned, to deceive the representatives of the American people, namely our congressmen and senators.
[00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.991]  A program!
[00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:57.132]  Yeah, into thinking that Saddam Hussein possessed
[00:10:57.853 --> 00:11:08.178]  Weapons of mass destruction, tricking them into giving their power and constitution to the President, and then allowing him to wage this unprovoked war.
[00:11:08.178 --> 00:11:16.602]  First time in our history that our country has ever, on such a scale, waged a deliberate, unprovoked war.
[00:11:16.602 --> 00:11:19.343]  Now, the other thing is, you mentioned the crazies.
[00:11:19.343 --> 00:11:25.126]  Well, you know, this is really an interesting situation because, as I think you mentioned yesterday, I used to
[00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:35.997]  Brief George Herbert Walker Bush when he was vice president every other morning and I worked directly for him when he was the director of the CIA.
[00:11:35.997 --> 00:11:41.542]  I think very highly of the man that we have a good personal relationship still.
[00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:53.712]  And, you know, when I think of the differences here between his son and him that just very striking, but getting back to the crazies during the mid 80s, early 80s,
[00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.431]  These fellows were all around.
[00:11:56.431 --> 00:12:00.393]  I mean, Wolfowitz, Weiss, Wormser, Bolton, Cheney, they were all around.
[00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:02.614]  They called Pearl the Prince of Darkness.
[00:12:02.614 --> 00:12:03.575]  Yeah, right.
[00:12:03.575 --> 00:12:05.095]  I should have mentioned him first.
[00:12:05.095 --> 00:12:17.061]  Now, they were all in the Pentagon or somewhere, but they were kept at a sort of innocuous middle level until Wolfowitz wrote that defense posture statement in early 92.
[00:12:17.061 --> 00:12:19.843]  Somebody leaked that, it went to the Times, and what did it say?
[00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:23.148]  It said all the things that we have now implemented.
[00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:36.099]  It said, for example, that when we see a situation where we have a chance to assert our strength in an area where we can, a strategic area like Iraq, as well as oil, we damn well better do that because that's our responsibility.
[00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:37.681]  That's manifest destiny for our
[00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:45.727]  And that was repeated by the PNAC documents, and the neocons will say, it's never about oil when we have signed confessions from it!
[00:12:45.727 --> 00:12:46.628]  Exactly.
[00:12:46.628 --> 00:13:03.602]  So, what I'm saying is here, that when that document came out, the Wolfowitz Defense Posture document, George Bush I was still in power, and he called his chief advisor, General Scowcroft, and Jim Baker, who was Secretary of State,
[00:13:04.162 --> 00:13:06.363]  And they discussed, what do you do about this?
[00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:07.924]  How did this guy get on the loose?
[00:13:07.924 --> 00:13:10.945]  You know, we're supposed to keep those people in their place.
[00:13:10.945 --> 00:13:16.608]  Well, they decided the only thing to do is to disavow it and put it in the circular file, which they did.
[00:13:16.608 --> 00:13:24.191]  And so, those of us who knew that story, when we saw what George Bush II started to do when he came into power here in Washington,
[00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:28.288]  And giving top jobs to Cheney.
[00:13:28.288 --> 00:13:33.669]  Well, Cheney, of course, was elected, but Rumsfeld and Faith and Wolfowitz and those folks.
[00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:36.529]  And we said, my God, the crazies are back.
[00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:37.970]  And why would we call them the crazies?
[00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.650]  Well, because that's how they were widely known in the 80s.
[00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.731]  If somebody said, whoops, something has to do with the crazies, everyone knew precisely who those folks were.
[00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:48.052]  And I submit to you, Alex,
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:59.125]  But if you look at the decisions that have been made with respect to Iraq over the last year or so, I mean, crazy is the only possible explanation.
[00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:06.788]  Well, we've had Marine Corps generals go public, we've had admirals, we've had CIA people, we've even had Skrovkov.
[00:14:06.788 --> 00:14:13.791]  But then they get called traitors by the media, and there is no so-called leftist media, and they claim all the leftists are against the war.
[00:14:16.641 --> 00:14:27.624]  Well, Alex, I hope this doesn't happen to you, but I had an interviewer on an ABC affiliate here in Washington who had me on maybe seven or eight times.
[00:14:27.624 --> 00:14:31.725]  There was another fellow in WOR up in New York that had me on twice.
[00:14:31.725 --> 00:14:33.525]  Both of them got canned.
[00:14:33.525 --> 00:14:36.586]  Both of them were told, we no longer need your services.
[00:14:37.245 --> 00:14:39.446]  When people called up and said, what happened?
[00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:42.648]  They said, well, the audience reaction wasn't all that good.
[00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:44.489]  Yeah, that's not true.
[00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:52.573]  They purposely, all over the country, censor calls now, Clare Channel and others do, where you can't even get on the air if you disagree.
[00:14:52.573 --> 00:14:59.796]  And then people hear the shows like it's the First Amendment and there's a discussion going on.
[00:14:59.796 --> 00:15:00.297]  It's not.
[00:15:00.297 --> 00:15:01.057]  It's staged.
[00:15:01.898 --> 00:15:04.980]  And it's very scary to see this happening.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.842]  Let's briefly, and then I'll take a few calls here, nerve gas.
[00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:18.328]  On the show you talked about what really happened with the nerve gas, who really nerve gassed the Kurds, and you talked about the cyanide-based nerve gas with the Iranians.
[00:15:18.328 --> 00:15:20.069]  You were there in the White House at the time.
[00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:21.549]  What really happened?
[00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:25.792]  Well, you know, Alex, that's still not altogether clear.
[00:15:27.046 --> 00:15:33.696]  One of my colleagues has written extensively suggesting that it was Iranian gas that was used there.
[00:15:34.412 --> 00:15:36.693]  But I am no expert on this.
[00:15:36.693 --> 00:16:01.068]  I have checked with many experts, and most of the others feel that it was indeed the Iraqis that gassed the folks in Khalajpah, but that it was, you know, it was not an extenuating circumstance, certainly, but it was during the war, it was in a pitched battle going on, and both sides were using nerve gas at the time, so it's not really
[00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:03.109]  Nothing is.
[00:16:03.109 --> 00:16:10.873]  Well, last time you were on, I read the articles about how when they tested the dead bodies, it was the Soviet variant of gas the Iranians were using.
[00:16:10.873 --> 00:16:16.996]  Yeah, I know, Alex, and I know I said that last time, but I've gone more deeply into it with more and more experts.
[00:16:17.694 --> 00:16:20.636]  And all I can say is that it's not conclusive.
[00:16:20.636 --> 00:16:21.717]  Well, no, I respect that.
[00:16:21.717 --> 00:16:23.739]  And understand, I'm not here defending Saddam Hussein.
[00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:24.860]  He's a horrible thug.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:40.352]  But compared to Bush saying, Taiwan, we're going to change our policy, or compared to giving reactors to North Korea, I just see this as an excuse to grab oil and sell weapons and to have a private cash machine for Dick Cheney and Halliburton.
[00:16:40.352 --> 00:16:41.413]  Your comments on that?
[00:16:41.957 --> 00:16:44.940]  Well, these are all true.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:54.089]  There's an overriding rationale for this, though, and that rationale appears in the documents to which you referred, the PNAC documents.
[00:16:54.089 --> 00:17:01.797]  For those of you who are listeners, just go on the web and type in, Project for a New American Century.
[00:17:02.876 --> 00:17:13.960]  And the documents that will appear there are the ideological, the strategic justification for the policies that are now being implemented by the crazies.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.500]  The war against Iraq and so forth.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.022]  And you'll see in those documents the equivalent of Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:27.664]  Now, Mein Kampf was the strategic document that if anybody took it seriously, they could have seen what was happening.
[00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:33.694]  And people have not taken very seriously the documents of the Project for a New American Century.
[00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:42.718]  Well, in the Rebuilding America's Defense of September 2000, Cheney says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:17:42.718 --> 00:17:45.680]  I mean, that is so insane, I can't believe I just said it.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.181]  I read it off their website.
[00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:50.382]  Legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:54.084]  They're talking about killing certain races, folks.
[00:17:54.084 --> 00:17:55.625]  Now, he wrote that.
[00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:15.806]  We'll be back with Ray McGovern and take some calls.
[00:18:15.806 --> 00:18:18.188]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:18:18.188 --> 00:18:20.931]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:18:22.646 --> 00:18:30.031]  I was talking to Ray McGovern during the break and we're not sure who used the nerve gas on who.
[00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:33.173]  They've got army documents that say it was the Iranians.
[00:18:33.173 --> 00:18:35.315]  They've got CIA that say it was Saddam.
[00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:38.076]  The point is they're all a bunch of thugs over there killing each other.
[00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.557]  We were backing Saddam.
[00:18:39.557 --> 00:18:42.119]  It's very hypocritical now to go, oh look how evil he is.
[00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:48.303]  America's cleaned him up for, you know, for everybody when we helped put this monster in power and backed up what he was doing.
[00:18:48.303 --> 00:18:49.964]  We're going to try to jam a few calls in here.
[00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:56.446]  For Ray McGovern, who I really appreciate coming on the show.
[00:18:56.446 --> 00:19:03.211]  Ray, and I know you can only speculate here, but using your analyst mind, do you think they'll assassinate Saddam?
[00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:07.174]  Will he get a Lee Harvey, Oswald, Jack Ruby type killing?
[00:19:07.174 --> 00:19:09.075]  Or will he get a fast developing cancer?
[00:19:09.075 --> 00:19:11.417]  Or will they torture him and roll him out?
[00:19:11.417 --> 00:19:17.641]  Or will he make a deal and blow the whistle on Iran or Syria with false info?
[00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:18.742]  What do you think is going to happen?
[00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:35.835]  Well Alex, it's a difficult situation for the administration because they need to get an international, objective, non-partisan presence in there as they deal with Saddam Hussein.
[00:19:37.101 --> 00:19:48.627]  Unfortunately, the arrogance and the disrespect for the opinion of humankind that has been illustrated by this regime in Washington would suggest that they're not going to do that.
[00:19:48.627 --> 00:19:55.211]  Now, if they don't do that, if they don't have somebody watching them, then all bets are off.
[00:19:55.211 --> 00:20:00.474]  Number one, they will never let Saddam Hussein say all he knows about the U.S.-Iraqi relationship.
[00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:08.118]  And number two, they will always disparage what he says if it doesn't accord with what they have said.
[00:20:08.118 --> 00:20:10.480]  For example, the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.660]  Well, where are they?
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.121]  Okay, where are they?
[00:20:13.121 --> 00:20:18.984]  I've been accused of having my tongue in cheek when I said the first thing they should ask him is, where are the weapons of mass destruction?
[00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:20.105]  And they did!
[00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:21.206]  Well, they did, yeah.
[00:20:21.206 --> 00:20:24.528]  But now, he says, there aren't any, okay?
[00:20:24.528 --> 00:20:26.309]  And people say, or the mass media says,
[00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:28.587]  Well, how are you going to trust him?
[00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:29.348]  He's lying.
[00:20:29.348 --> 00:20:31.770]  Well, is David Kaye, the U.S.
[00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.070]  U.N.
[00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.332]  Inspector, lying when he says it?
[00:20:34.332 --> 00:20:37.674]  Well, the point is, is that they didn't have that many weapons before the war.
[00:20:37.674 --> 00:20:38.835]  They had a lot less after.
[00:20:38.835 --> 00:20:40.877]  They're nothing compared to their other neighbors.
[00:20:40.877 --> 00:20:47.002]  You can't have one policy for Iraq and ten other policies for other countries that are a hundred times more dangerous.
[00:20:47.002 --> 00:20:49.444]  Mike in Ohio, you're on the air with our guest, Ray McGovern.
[00:20:49.444 --> 00:20:50.465]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:51.425]  Hi, Mike.
[00:20:51.425 --> 00:20:52.907]  Yeah, my name's Mark.
[00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:54.949]  That's okay.
[00:20:54.949 --> 00:21:03.251]  Mr. McGovern, what was your cabinet post there at the Bush-Reagan administration?
[00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:05.151]  Mark, it wasn't a cabinet post.
[00:21:05.151 --> 00:21:14.153]  I was one of the CIA briefers that took the President's daily briefs down in the morning and briefed the highest advisors to the President.
[00:21:14.153 --> 00:21:14.613]  Okay.
[00:21:14.613 --> 00:21:20.074]  I'm also familiar with the Wolfowitz document.
[00:21:20.074 --> 00:21:21.334]  Is there some way I can actually
[00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:26.091]  I believe so.
[00:21:26.091 --> 00:21:29.192]  Try first with the Project for a New American Century.
[00:21:29.192 --> 00:21:31.032]  Project for a New American Century?
[00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:33.133]  Yeah, and I'm sure that they would have links to it.
[00:21:33.133 --> 00:21:34.573]  Yeah, that's their website, too.
[00:21:34.573 --> 00:21:36.233]  It's not us saying this.
[00:21:36.233 --> 00:21:37.314]  Oh, it is?
[00:21:37.314 --> 00:21:46.836]  Yeah, and you know, for example, one of those documents, the one that Alex just referred to, talks about the ability of our military has to be able to
[00:21:47.826 --> 00:21:57.114]  Uh, wage two wars, uh, at the same time, and also conduct what they call constabulatory, uh, duties.
[00:21:57.114 --> 00:22:00.276]  In other words, be constables in the countries that we occupy.
[00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:01.697]  Yeah, occupy countries in material.
[00:22:01.697 --> 00:22:05.880]  Actually, I'm familiar with that document a little bit, because I saw a PBS special.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.102]  Mark, I've got to let you go.
[00:22:08.102 --> 00:22:12.986]  I just want to also tell you that, uh, your signal's being jammed here in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:22:12.986 --> 00:22:15.888]  So, apparently, your guest right now... Okay, thank you for the call.
[00:22:15.888 --> 00:22:16.649]  I've got to let you go.
[00:22:17.429 --> 00:22:19.931]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:19.931 --> 00:22:21.692]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[00:22:21.692 --> 00:22:22.773]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[00:22:22.773 --> 00:22:24.094]  Ray McGovern, thanks for coming on.
[00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:25.895]  Not at all, Alex.
[00:22:25.895 --> 00:22:28.597]  Hope they don't jam your signal.
[00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:30.419]  Thank you.
[00:22:30.419 --> 00:22:33.021]  Sorry to Ed and everybody else.
[00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:34.602]  Bunch of callers we didn't have time to get to.
[00:22:34.602 --> 00:22:36.483]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[00:22:36.483 --> 00:22:37.604]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[00:22:37.604 --> 00:22:41.287]  Thanks to all the affiliates, the sponsors, number one, the listeners, and God.
[00:22:42.353 --> 00:22:46.455]  But on this earth, thanks to the listeners, and in heaven, thanks to God.
[00:22:46.455 --> 00:22:53.778]  Pray for America, and pray for the people's minds and souls, that their eyes be open for the hypocritical corruption all around us.
[00:22:53.778 --> 00:22:57.360]  Because while they're dealing with Saddam, they're creating ten more just like him.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.901]  We'll be back tonight, back tomorrow.
