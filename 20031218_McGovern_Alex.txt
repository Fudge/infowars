[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central back from 9 to midnight.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  Going out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California to Providence, Rhode Island from Denver, Colorado to Austin, Texas.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 9320 and at night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000]  And on the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and we're fighting Earth being turned into a fascistic prison planet right now.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  We're about to go to our guest, Ray McGovern, a 26-year senior analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  He personally advised Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush and others.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]  And he's part of an organization that's trying to bring some sanity to all of this.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  And I found his research, his historical understanding to be very, very accurate from my research.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]  That's coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  I've got quite a few questions for him.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  And I know we've got a bunch of callers on this subject of Saddam and the rest of it.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  So we'll get to you too.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  Before I go to Mr. McGovern, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  I've made ten films.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  My tenth film, Matrix of Evil, is out.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  It's got Congressman Ron Paul talking about the follyness of this war and PNAC and the neo-cons.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney talking about prior knowledge of 9-11, Dine Corps and the U.N. caught kidnapping children.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  This is mainstream news, folks.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]  Frank Morales, police state expert.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  Colonel Craig Roberts on the globalists and the gun control and the rest of it.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  Myself throwing the Patriot Act out in Austin.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]  It's full of solutions.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  Two hours, ten minutes, $25.95.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  Order three or more of any of the ten films I've made.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  Whether it's 9-11, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  When I infiltrated that for the British media.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  You need to get all these videos.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  They're all over two hours, $25.95.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  Order three or more.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]  They drop down to $20.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  There's Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, a lead-sponsored terror in the New World Order.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  We have Eric Huffman's video about 9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  You need to have all of these.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]  We have the video on the USS Liberty, Loss of Liberty.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  Get the films.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  Get them on Access Television.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  Get them out to opinion makers.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  They're changing people's minds.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  Or PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com to order.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000]  And I'm at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  Take action.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  Ray McGovern was going to join us yesterday.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  He did briefly.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  He had to go as part of an emergency meeting or something.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  Something he had to take care of with a program he does for inner-city kids.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  He does join us today here for the next 25 minutes or so.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000]  Mr. McGovern, just in a nutshell, a brief history of who Saddam really works for,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  what really happened in the 80s, what this capture means.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  Of course, none of us are fans of Saddam, but what this really means and how can they allow him to be tried
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  if he's going to blow the whistle on who sold him the chemicals and biologicals.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  You have the floor.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  Go ahead.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  Well, it's good to be back, Alex.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  You bet.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  Thank you for inviting me.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  It's a complex story and I'll try to be brief.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  Back in the 80s, of course, we had just escaped from the trauma of having all those U.S. diplomats
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  and others holed up in the U.S. Embassy in Iran.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  So, Iranians were our primary, quote, enemy in those days.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  Certainly, we didn't want any of the Iranians to be expanding their power still more.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  So, Saddam Hussein was seen as a counterweight to that.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  So, he became a bad guy, but he became our bad guy, sort of like Noriega in Panama.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  There's a difference between other guys' bad guys and our bad guys.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  Okay, so we supported Saddam Hussein during his war with Iran to the point of exchanging
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  very sensitive intelligence with him, which gave him the upper hand.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  We also did all kinds of things in terms of allowing sensitive materials to get to Iraq.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  Those materials later criticized as being precursors to chemical and biological weapons.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]  Well, the 1994 Senate report says anthrax, botulism, West Nile as well.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  That's exactly right.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  And so, it's quite hypocritical since we knew that he was using nerve gas, for example,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  against the Iranians.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  In those years, all of a sudden, we turned around after supporting him in that,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]  after saying nothing about it, essentially.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  Then, all of a sudden, he becomes an imminent danger, not only to his neighbors, but to us.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  And that's after his real capability has been blown to bits.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  I mean, they could say he was dangerous in 1990, but not after 1991.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  I mean, I hear him on the news going, he attacked Iran.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  He came to power in 1979.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  He's a vicious killer.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  Didn't our government basically back in 1954 use him as a CIA assassin?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  Well, I'm told.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]  I don't know this officially, but I'm told that our government did support his consolidation of power.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]  And that seems pretty clear from the historical record.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]  But the whole thing is the background here, and it relates to your other question, Alex,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000]  when you question how we can possibly allow a free and unfettered trial of this fellow.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  And that's going to be a real problem for our administration,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]  because if Saddam Hussein is allowed to say all the things he could say,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]  it will be very damning to U.S. policy going back into the 80s.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  And it will show that it's been a very two-faced policy.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]  Well, the Israelis at the Debco file, mainly Mossad folks, say he looked like he'd been held for weeks,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  if not months, and that he'd been worked over pretty bad.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  And then we have Congressman McDermott saying that.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  And then he's attacked as partisan.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  But then I have another congressman here, LaHood, Ray LaHood, on December the 2nd,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  told the Associated Press that, I know something you don't know.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  We're about to give you Saddam.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]  So what do you think is really going on here?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  Yeah, I found LaHood's comments really intriguing.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  And he sits on the intelligence committee in the Congress,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  and so he has access to some of this information.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  I don't have a definitive judgment on this, but it is intriguing indeed.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]  Well, how can they say that McDermott is an evil communist traitor, as the neocons are now saying,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]  for saying something that Frank said in Cigar Aficionado in the December issue, the head of CENTCOM,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  saying something that LaHood said?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  Yeah. Well, you know, this business of name-calling, when people call General Zinni, for example,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  who headed the CENTCOM troops, when they call him a Marine general, highly decorated,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  when they call him a traitor of some kind, and now they call other people traitors,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  I mean, that just shows the depths to which the discussion has degenerated.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  Now, take Congressman, the one from Washington you just mentioned.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  McDermott.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  McDermott, yeah.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  He was over there, you may recall, he was over there in the fall of 02, okay?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  And I remember George Stephanopoulos asking him live on his program,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  Congressman McDermott, do you think that the President would deceive the American people?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  And Congressman McDermott smiled and he said, of course I do.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  And George Stephanopoulos sort of gulped,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  and I could hear the TV rooms in my rather affluent neighborhood,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  I could hear the gasps going off, like that.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  And of course then McDermott said, you know,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]  deceiving the American people is a bipartisan activity.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  He said, think of how Lyndon Johnson deceived the American people.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  And so don't be surprised,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]  just to be aware that any time a President decides to go to war,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  which Bush had already decided three months previous,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  any time a U.S. President decides to go to war,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  then you cannot really expect that you'll get the full story.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  Look at all the lies we've seen about fake news articles posted by the Pentagon,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  signed by troops that never saw it,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  Jessica Lynch fables,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  Niger uranium deals that didn't exist,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  mobile weapons trucks.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  They knew day one were British sold trucks for pumping up hot air balloons.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  I mean, they knew all this.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  And how can we believe anything they say?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  I've never seen lies at this level.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  And I cut my teeth, Mr. McGovern, exposing Bill Clinton.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  I have never seen a wall of lies.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  Have you like this?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  I have not.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  And let me just add to that, Alex.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  And I go back a ways.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  I came on in government when John F. Kennedy was President.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  And so I saw LBJ and I saw Nixon and so all the rest of them.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]  And there was a lot of duplicity and there were a lot of lies.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  And why are you now speaking up?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  I saw you on a British interview saying,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  compared to Scowcroft and Bush and the senior,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  the people running the White House now are, quote, crazies.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]  Yeah.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  Well, now, that phrase goes back to the 80s.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  But let me just tell you the difference between now and then with respect to the lies.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  Okay.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]  I have never seen such a well-orchestrated,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  the epitome of PR proficiency campaign going for 18 months as they prepared for this war.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  You see, the other lies, the lie about the Gulf of Tonkin,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  well, that was sort of a spur-of-the-moment opportunity as LBJ saw it.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  I don't excuse that, but it's a different kind of concern.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  What we had over the last 18 months was a concerted campaign,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  extremely well planned, to deceive the representatives of the American people,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  namely our congressmen and senators.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  A program.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]  Yeah, into thinking that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  tricking them into giving their power and constitution to the President
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  and then allowing him to wage this unprovoked war.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  First time in our history that our country has ever on such a scale waged a deliberate unprovoked war.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  Now, the other thing is, you mentioned the crazies.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  Well, you know, this is really an interesting situation because,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  as I think you mentioned yesterday,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  I used to brief George Herbert Walker Bush when he was Vice President every other morning,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  and I worked directly for him when he was the Director of the CIA.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]  I think very highly of the man and we have a good personal relationship still.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  And, you know, when I think of the differences here between his son and him,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  it's just very striking.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  But getting back to the crazies, during the mid-'80s, the early-'80s,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  these fellows were all around.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  I mean, Wolfowitz, Vice, Wormser, Bolton, Cheney, they were all around.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]  Michael Pearl, the Prince of Darkness.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  Yeah, right.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  I should have mentioned him first.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  Now, they were all in the Pentagon or somewhere,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  but they were kept at a sort of innocuous middle level.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]  Until Wolfowitz wrote that defense posture statement in early'92,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  somebody leaked that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  It went to the Times.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  And what did it say?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  It said all the things that we have now implemented.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  It said, for example, that when we see a situation where we have a chance to assert our strength
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  in an area where we can, a strategic area like Iraq has all that oil,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  we damn well better do that because that's our responsibility.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]  That's the name for our country.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  And that was repeated by the PNAC documents.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  And the neocons will say it's never about oil when we have signed confessions from them.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  So what I'm saying is here that when that document came out,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  the Wolfowitz defense posture document, George Bush I was still in power.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  And he called his chief advisor, General Scowcroft, and Jim Baker, who was Secretary of State,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  and they discussed, what do you do about this?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  How did this guy get on the loose?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  We're supposed to keep those people in their place.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]  Well, they decided the only thing to do is to disavow it and put it in the circular file,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  which they did.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  And so those of us who knew that story,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  when we saw what George Bush II started to do when he came into power here in Washington
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  and giving top jobs to Cheney.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  Well, Cheney, of course, was elected, but Rumsfeld and Feith and Wolfowitz and those folks.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  And we said, my God, the crazies are back.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  And why would we call them the crazies?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  Well, because that's how they were widely known in the 80s.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  If somebody said, whoops, something to do with the crazies,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]  everyone knew precisely who those folks were.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  And I submit to you, Alex, that if you look at the decisions that have been made with respect to Iraq
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  over the last year or so, I mean, crazies is the only possible explanation.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  Well, we've had Marine Corps generals go public.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  We've had admirals.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  We've had CIA people.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  We've even had Scowcroft.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]  But then they get called traitors by the media.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]  And there is no so-called leftist media.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  And they claim all the leftists are against the war.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  Well, Alex, I hope this doesn't happen to you.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  I had an interviewer on an ABC affiliate here in Washington who had me on maybe seven or eight times.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  There was another fellow in WOR up in New York that had me on twice.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  Both of them got canned.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  Both of them were told, we know we only need your services.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  And when people called up and said, what happened?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]  They said, well, the audience reaction wasn't all that good.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  Yeah, and that's not true.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  They purposely all over the country censor calls now, Clare Channel and others do,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  where you can't even get on the air if you disagree.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  And then people hear the shows like it's the First Amendment and there's a discussion going on.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  It's not.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  It's staged.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  And it's very scary to see this happening.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  Let's briefly, and then I want to take a few calls here, nerve gas.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  On this show you talked about what really happened with the nerve gas,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  who really nerve gassed the Kurds, and you talked about the cyanide-based nerve gas of the Iranians.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  You were there in the White House at the time.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  What really happened?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  Well, you know, Alex, that's still not altogether clear.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  One of my colleagues has written extensively suggesting that it was Iranian gas that was used there.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  But I am no expert on this.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  I have checked with many experts, and most of the others feel that it was indeed the Iraqis that gassed the folks in Khalajba.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  But it was not an extenuating circumstance, certainly.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  But it was during the war.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  It was in a pitched battle going on.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  And both sides were using nerve gas at the time.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  So it's not really, nothing is...
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  Well, last time you were on, I read the articles about how when they tested the dead bodies,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  it was the Soviet variant of gas the Iranians were using.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  Yeah, I know, Alex, and I know I said that last time,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  but I've gone more deeply into it with more and more experts.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  And all I can say is that it's not conclusive.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  Well, no, I respect that and understand I'm not here defending Saddam Hussein.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  He's a horrible thug.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  But compared to Bush saying, Taiwan, you know, we're going to change your policy,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  or compared to giving reactors in North Korea, I just see this as an excuse to grab oil and sell weapons
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]  and to have a private cash machine for Dick Cheney.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  And Halliburton, your comments on that?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  Well, these are all true.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  There's an overriding rationale for this, though,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  and that rationale appears in the documents to which you referred, the PNAC documents.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  And for those of you who are listeners, just go on the web and type in project for a new American century.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  And the documents that will appear there are the ideological, the strategic justification
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  for the policies that are now being implemented by the crazies, the war against Iraq and so forth.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  And you'll see in those documents the equivalent of Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  You know, Mein Kampf was the strategic document that if anybody took it seriously,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  they could have seen what was happening.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]  And people have not taken very seriously the documents of the project for a new American century.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  Well, in the Rebuilding America's Defense of September 2000,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  Faney says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  I mean, that is so insane, I can't believe I just said it.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  I read it off their website, legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  They're talking about killing certain races, folks.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  Now, he wrote that.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  We'll be back with Ray McGovern and take some calls.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:28.700]  I was talking to Ray McGovern during the break and we're not sure who used the nerve
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.900]  guess on who. They've got army documents that say it was the Iranians. They've got CIA that
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.820]  say it was Saddam. The point is they're all a bunch of thugs over there killing each other.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.380]  We were backing Saddam. It's very hypocritical now to go oh look how evil he is. America's
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.100]  cleaning him up for you know for everybody when we helped put this monster in power and
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.820]  backed up what he was doing. We're going to try to jam a few calls in here
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:56.540]  up for Ray McGovern. I really appreciate coming on the show. Ray,
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.620]  and I know you can only speculate here but using your analyst mind you think they'll assassinate
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:08.460]  Saddam? Will he get a Lee Harvey Oswald Jack Ruby type killing or will he get a fast developing
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:14.620]  cancer or will they torture him and roll him out or will he make a deal and blow the whistle on
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:22.140]  Iran or Syria with false info? What do you think is going to happen? Well Alex it's a difficult
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:31.580]  situation for the administration because they need to get an international objective non-partisan
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:39.020]  presence in there as they deal with Saddam Hussein. Unfortunately the arrogance and the
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:46.220]  disrespect for the opinion of humankind that has been illustrated by this regime in Washington
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.140]  would suggest that they're not going to do that. Now if they don't do that if they don't have
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:57.580]  somebody watching them then all the bets are off. Number one they will never let Saddam Hussein say
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:05.420]  all he knows about the U.S. Iraqi relationship and number two they will always disparage what
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.300]  he says if it doesn't accord with what they have said. For example the weapons of mass destruction,
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.580]  well where are they? Okay where are they? I've been accused of having my tongue in cheek when
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.940]  I said the first thing they should ask him is where are the weapons of mass destruction? And
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:25.660]  they did. Well they did yeah but now now he says there aren't any okay and people say or the mass
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:31.900]  media says aha well how are you going to trust him he's lying. Well is David Kay the U.S. U.N.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.860]  inspector lying when he says it? Well the point is is that they didn't have that many weapons
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.860]  before the war they had a lot less after. They're nothing compared to their other neighbors. You
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.180]  can't have one policy for Iraq and ten other policies for other countries that are a hundred
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:50.220]  times more dangerous. Mike in Ohio you're on the air with our guest Ray McGovern go ahead Mike.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:58.620]  Hi Mike. Yeah my name is Mark but that's okay. Mr. McGovern when was your cabinet
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:04.220]  post there at the at the Bush-Reagan administration? Mark it wasn't a cabinet
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.420]  post. I was one of the CIA briefers that took the president's daily briefs down in the morning and
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:16.140]  briefed the the highest advisors to the president. Okay I'm very familiar I'm also familiar with
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:23.180]  Wolfowitz with the document. Is there some way I can actually buy that defense
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.540]  posture document on the internet? I believe so try first with the project for a new American
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.940]  century. Project for new American century? Yeah and I'm sure that they would have links to it.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:39.340]  Yeah that's their website too it's not us saying this. Yeah oh it is? Yeah and you know for example
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.260]  one of those documents the one that Alex just referred to talks about the ability of our
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:52.860]  military has to be able to wage two wars at the same time and also conduct what they call
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:22:00.780]  constabulary duties in other words be constables in the countries that we occupy. Occupied
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.660]  countries. Yeah actually I'm familiar with that document a little bit because I saw a PBS special.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.340]  Mark I gotta let you go. Oh sir I just want to also tell you that your your signal's being jammed
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:16.140]  here in Cincinnati Ohio so apparently your guest right now. Okay thank you for the call gotta let
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.980]  you go. We're out of time ladies and gentlemen. I'll be back tonight nine to midnight back tomorrow
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.940]  eleven to two. Ray McGovern thanks for coming on. Not at all Alex. Hope they don't jam your signal.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.540]  Thank you. Sorry to Ed and everybody else bunch of crawlers we didn't have time to get to. Back
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.580]  tonight nine to midnight back tomorrow eleven to two. Thanks to all the affiliates with sponsors
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:45.340]  number one the listeners in God but on this earth thanks to the listeners in heaven thanks to God
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.940]  and pray for America and pray for the people's minds and souls that their eyes be open for the
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.420]  hypocritical corruption all around us because while they're dealing with Saddam they're creating
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.620]  ten more just like him. We'll be back tonight back tomorrow.
