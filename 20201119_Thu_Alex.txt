[00:00.000 --> 00:16.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us in these very, very dark times.
[00:16.840 --> 00:17.840]  That is the bad news.
[00:17.840 --> 00:20.120]  The good news is humanity is awakening.
[00:20.120 --> 00:27.160]  Again, thank you for joining us on this Thursday, October 19th, 2020 transmission.
[00:27.160 --> 00:32.880]  We have right-side broadcastings live feed, and as soon as Giuliani launches this press
[00:32.880 --> 00:37.400]  conference, Rudolph Giuliani, Trump's main lawyer, we will go right to it.
[00:37.400 --> 00:40.040]  It's called the path to victory press conference.
[00:40.040 --> 00:41.280]  We have a path to victory.
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.280]  It's comparing the signatures and all these states that the states did not look at under
[00:46.280 --> 00:47.280]  law.
[00:47.280 --> 00:48.280]  They have to.
[00:48.280 --> 00:52.600]  It's also the dissent decrees where they authorized outside of legislative law and all
[00:52.600 --> 00:58.920]  these key battleground states under the Clinton's directives working for Biden and this whole
[00:58.920 --> 01:06.440]  globalist operation to allow mail-in ballots outside of law and to flood 80 million of
[01:06.440 --> 01:13.080]  them so they can engage in this fraud, totally different from, of course, the classic absentee
[01:13.080 --> 01:18.040]  ballot where you're a registered voter, so you get it, you request it.
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.800]  So Owen Schroyer is in Austin, Texas, he's monitoring the press conference, and so Owen,
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.640]  break in and take over as soon as that press conference goes up, we're going to be carrying
[01:26.640 --> 01:27.640]  that.
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.360]  I've done a lot of preparation here, though, on how to stop the great reset and how to stop
[01:32.360 --> 01:37.360]  a new dark age, that once they've got it in place, it's very hard to reverse.
[01:37.360 --> 01:43.480]  So I've really thought about this, I've focused on it, and I have a plan that we the people
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.640]  could implement, even if Trump is not in office, through the state legislatures and through
[01:47.640 --> 01:52.840]  other governments around the world, particularly Eastern Europe and African countries, they're
[01:52.840 --> 01:57.640]  aware of what the IMF and World Bank are doing, this is all an IMF World Bank mega-banker
[01:57.640 --> 02:02.680]  takeover, I've already researched it, already read the books written by these people, but
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.160]  now they've made even more statements admitting it is a banking takeover where they're going
[02:07.160 --> 02:12.480]  to have the government nationalize all businesses and come into your life and control you.
[02:12.480 --> 02:19.920]  This is a corporate fascist takeover, but using, again, communism at the grassroots level,
[02:19.920 --> 02:26.000]  and these very bankers that bankrupt us, they are then above the law and can do whatever
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.280]  they want, whatever they want and are totally tax-exempt.
[02:30.280 --> 02:35.240]  Some of the headlines that tie all this together that I'm going to be covering are South Australia
[02:35.240 --> 02:40.360]  enters another lockdown after just 36 new coronavirus infections, and this is the key,
[02:40.360 --> 02:45.400]  they say, no one can ever come out again until no one ever has it again.
[02:45.400 --> 02:49.800]  That's totally impossible, once a new flu virus or cold virus is out there, it never
[02:49.800 --> 02:50.800]  goes away.
[02:50.800 --> 02:54.960]  And now, of course, there's new mutations, this is just the end of civilization teaching
[02:54.960 --> 02:58.400]  you've got to hide in your house like chicken little.
[02:58.400 --> 03:03.240]  New strains of COVID could render vaccines completely useless and two dangerous new strains
[03:03.240 --> 03:04.520]  are already spreading.
[03:04.520 --> 03:08.400]  That's all being reported because it's a problem they never want to be fixed, and I found a
[03:08.400 --> 03:13.560]  clip of Klaus Schwab in June of this year who's running this whole operation for Bill
[03:13.560 --> 03:19.320]  Gates out of the Davos group saying, we can never come back to normal and we can never
[03:19.320 --> 03:22.560]  open back up again until it is all eradicated.
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.200]  We don't know the solution, so life as you know it is over, there will be major poverty
[03:27.200 --> 03:30.400]  and war and people will be very angry.
[03:30.400 --> 03:35.080]  So to save a million people, if you count all the COVID deaths worldwide, will kill tens
[03:35.080 --> 03:37.000]  of millions of starvation and have a global collapse.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.400]  I mean, for them, and they go, don't worry, we're going to loan you money out of nowhere
[03:42.400 --> 03:46.520]  and own everything you've got is a very good idea.
[03:46.520 --> 03:53.440]  Meanwhile, top pathologist claims coronavirus is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on us
[03:53.440 --> 03:54.440]  expecting public.
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.760]  He's the most respected pathologist in Canada.
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.640]  He was in a parliamentary Zoom meeting between the state governments, the provinces, and
[04:03.640 --> 04:07.200]  the federal government and just said, look, it's the biggest hoax ever.
[04:07.200 --> 04:08.200]  Guess what?
[04:08.200 --> 04:12.440]  YouTube and Facebook and Twitter are now blocking his video.
[04:12.440 --> 04:18.240]  Even the top government advisor has a soul, says greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.520]  unsuspecting public and just totally abusing people's confidence in the medical system.
[04:23.520 --> 04:26.520]  Trust the scientist, that means Fauci and Bill Gates.
[04:26.520 --> 04:33.000]  Look at this one, New York Times says great reset is a conspiracy theory on same day world
[04:33.000 --> 04:34.800]  economic forum celebrates it.
[04:34.800 --> 04:38.880]  So that's always the tactic is, world government's good for you.
[04:38.880 --> 04:39.880]  We don't want it.
[04:39.880 --> 04:40.880]  Okay, it doesn't exist.
[04:40.880 --> 04:42.800]  And it goes on and on and on.
[04:42.800 --> 04:47.120]  Man dies and for falling 10 feet from ladder, Dr. Zickler COVID-19 killed him.
[04:47.120 --> 04:50.800]  And now they're raiding medical doctors that speak out against the tyranny in Germany with
[04:50.800 --> 04:51.800]  SWAT teams.
[04:51.800 --> 04:54.480]  We have video of that dramatic video coming up.
[04:54.480 --> 04:55.480]  Stay with us.
[04:55.480 --> 04:56.480]  We are live.
[04:56.480 --> 05:03.720]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired, even worshiped for thousands
[05:03.720 --> 05:06.920]  of years by ancient civilizations with modern science.
[05:06.920 --> 05:09.400]  We know why turmeric is so popular.
[05:09.400 --> 05:11.240]  It's antioxidant effect.
[05:11.240 --> 05:14.200]  It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[05:14.200 --> 05:16.400]  Everything it does is simply amazing.
[05:16.400 --> 05:20.000]  And most tumorics out there are simply food products.
[05:20.000 --> 05:29.720]  They're 3 to 5% curcuminoid, but we have bodies ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid
[05:29.720 --> 05:30.720]  level.
[05:30.720 --> 05:34.520]  And we have other organic products in there that accelerated and bring it into the cells
[05:34.520 --> 05:35.520]  of the body.
[05:35.520 --> 05:36.760]  It's been sold out for months.
[05:36.760 --> 05:37.760]  It's back in stock.
[05:37.760 --> 05:44.240]  And despite that, bodies ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50% off with
[05:44.240 --> 05:48.400]  free shipping and triple patriot points and infowarstore.com.
[05:48.400 --> 05:50.600]  Most bodies ultimate turmeric formula.
[05:50.600 --> 05:56.160]  If you haven't tried it, learn why it's got thousands of 5 star reviews at infowarstore.com
[05:56.160 --> 05:57.160]  and you can't lose it.
[05:57.160 --> 06:27.080]  Funds the infowar.
[06:27.080 --> 06:47.960]  And
[06:47.960 --> 06:55.920]  as soon as that begins to take place, we will go live to it with Owen shroyer.
[06:55.920 --> 07:01.680]  but I want listeners to understand something. We have some particularly massive news here.
[07:02.480 --> 07:07.840]  Folks know that we're next year's news today, tomorrow's news today. I've really been focusing
[07:07.840 --> 07:14.080]  historically and currently and looking into the future on what needs to be done and I have a plan
[07:14.640 --> 07:18.560]  and if you want to get out of the strength jacket, if you want to get out of being a slave,
[07:19.200 --> 07:23.920]  it needs to be done right now. We have to start resisting and speaking
[07:23.920 --> 07:27.760]  on getting very, very aggressive right now. We have to call out the people behind this and the
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.120]  people who orchestrated this, the fact that it's an organized criminal fraud to put the whole world
[07:33.120 --> 07:37.840]  into more debt and to put the middle class into debt to the IMF and World Bank, that the very
[07:37.840 --> 07:42.400]  central banks are bragging and putting out business perspectives on how much money they're
[07:42.400 --> 07:46.240]  going to make out of this. Just like when they would put in a government in Greece and plunge
[07:46.240 --> 07:50.160]  their economy, all the private jets would land coming in buying up the private islands.
[07:50.160 --> 07:54.880]  For themselves, we are being put into cardiac arrest financially
[07:56.640 --> 08:01.440]  so they can buy everything up, depending on the dollar, bringing a castle society,
[08:01.440 --> 08:07.200]  a medical tyranny, tracking system, social credit score. This is the big move. Everything from this
[08:07.200 --> 08:13.600]  point on just accelerates at like speed. I likened it last night on a very successful Twitter
[08:14.480 --> 08:18.720]  periscope feed I did with Ali Alexander had a couple hundred thousand people on it watching
[08:18.720 --> 08:23.040]  as of last night, who knows what it is today, about climbing a mountain and you get to a
[08:23.040 --> 08:27.600]  mountain peak and it's a cliff. It took you a long time, you know, days to climb it,
[08:27.600 --> 08:32.400]  but when you jump off it and fall 10,000 feet, it just takes a minute or so to hit the bottom.
[08:32.400 --> 08:36.960]  We are in free fall now. Now we have a parachute that's called God and it's called us getting
[08:36.960 --> 08:41.280]  active and it's called us declaring our own independence and not complying, but we're about
[08:41.280 --> 08:46.480]  a third of the way falling right now and we're falling fast. So this is very, very serious.
[08:46.480 --> 08:50.880]  Oh, and Shroyer, everything coming to a head, everything out in the open now.
[08:51.600 --> 08:54.880]  The enemy had to emerge at a certain point. Boy, are they not making their move on.
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.080]  And Alex, it's so hard to decide what to have your focus on, what to keep your eye on,
[09:02.080 --> 09:08.320]  you know, what ball to follow, the bouncing balls. Is it the COVID hoax worldwide to establish a
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.840]  world government? Is it the complete theft, the complete rig of our elections that we have to
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.880]  fight to? And we're trying to fight both of these beasts and the average American doesn't even see
[09:18.880 --> 09:23.280]  them. They don't even know that it's going on. And so we're here trying to get them to engage in
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.240]  this battle with us and they can't even see the elephant in the room. It does appear that Trump's
[09:28.240 --> 09:33.280]  lawyers are now entering the press conference right now. Alex, the cameras have turned around.
[09:33.280 --> 09:41.120]  So let's go live in Washington, DC, the Republican National Committee Center there as Trump's legal
[09:41.120 --> 09:45.840]  team is coming out. You can see Alex, they have a little board there. You have Rudy Giuliani,
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.160]  you have Sidney Powell, you have Jenna Ellis, and Rudy Giuliani looks like he is going to lead us off.
[09:52.960 --> 09:59.120]  And thank you very much for coming. This is representative of our legal team.
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.160]  We're representing President Trump and we're representing the Trump campaign.
[10:04.160 --> 10:14.240]  When I finish, Sidney Powell and then Jenna Ellis will follow me and we will present
[10:14.800 --> 10:19.920]  in brief the evidence that we've collected over the last, I guess it is two weeks.
[10:20.800 --> 10:27.600]  Also, Joseph Genever, Victoria Tenzing here with me. There are more lawyers working on this, but
[10:27.600 --> 10:38.000]  we're the, I guess we're the, we're the senior lawyers and Boris Epstein. So I guess the best
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.640]  way to describe this is when we began our representation of the president, we certainly
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.400]  were confronted with a very anomalous set of results. The president way ahead on election night,
[10:50.400 --> 10:58.960]  7 or 800,000 in Pennsylvania, somehow he lost Pennsylvania. We have statisticians willing
[10:58.960 --> 11:03.600]  to testify that that's almost statistically impossible to have happened in the period of
[11:03.600 --> 11:09.280]  time that it happened. But of course, that's just speculation. As we started investigating,
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.960]  both our investigations and the very patriotic and brave American citizens that have come forward
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.920]  are extraordinary, extraordinary number of people, extraordinary number of witnesses.
[11:22.560 --> 11:27.920]  And what emerged very quickly is, is it's not a singular voter fraud in one state.
[11:28.800 --> 11:36.880]  This pattern repeats itself in a number of states, almost exactly the same pattern, which to any
[11:37.520 --> 11:45.200]  experienced investigator, prosecutor would suggest that there was a plan from a centralized place
[11:45.200 --> 11:53.920]  to execute these various acts of voter fraud specifically focused on big cities. And specifically
[11:53.920 --> 12:01.680]  focused on, as you would imagine, big cities controlled by Democrats. And particularly focused
[12:01.680 --> 12:08.240]  on big cities that have a long history of corruption. The number of voter fraud cases in
[12:08.240 --> 12:15.600]  Philadelphia could fill a library. Just a few weeks ago, there was a conviction for voter fraud
[12:15.600 --> 12:24.000]  and one, two weeks before that. And I've often said, I guess, sarcastically, but it's true,
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.760]  the only surprise I would have found in this is if Philadelphia hadn't cheated in this election.
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.520]  Because for the last 60 years, they've cheated in just about every single election.
[12:35.520 --> 12:40.240]  You could say the same thing about Detroit. Each one of these cities are cities that are
[12:40.240 --> 12:43.520]  controlled by Democrats, which means they can get away with anything they want to do.
[12:44.320 --> 12:50.000]  It means they have a certain degree of control over, certainly control the election board completely,
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.840]  and they control law enforcement. And unfortunately, they have some friendly judges
[12:56.320 --> 13:02.880]  that will issue ridiculously irrational opinions just to come out in their favor.
[13:02.880 --> 13:11.600]  So let's start with the specifics. Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, the margin of victory now
[13:11.600 --> 13:24.480]  for Biden, which is a not a victory, it's a fraud, is 69,140 votes. The reality is that we are now
[13:24.480 --> 13:33.520]  at a count of 682,770 ballots, for which we have affidavits, that there was no inspection of that
[13:33.520 --> 13:41.040]  ballot at the time that it was entered in the vote. It was a mail ballot. Mail ballots are
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.800]  particularly prone to fraud. We were warned about that by Jimmy Carter, President Jimmy Carter,
[13:46.800 --> 13:54.000]  and Secretary Baker, in a report about a dozen years ago in which they said that mail ballots
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.200]  and mail balloting is particularly susceptible of fraud, that we should very carefully consider
[14:01.200 --> 14:06.480]  ever doing it, and that it can be taken advantage of. Justice Souter warned us of the same thing
[14:07.040 --> 14:14.080]  in a comment in an election law case. And even the New York Times wrote articles
[14:15.120 --> 14:22.320]  about how dangerous mail voting, mail-in voting was. And this is the first time we ever did it
[14:22.320 --> 14:29.360]  en masse. And I think we proved that all three are profits. It's not only susceptible to fraud,
[14:30.080 --> 14:37.200]  it is easily susceptible to fraud, particularly if you have a plan or scheme which sounds eerily
[14:37.200 --> 14:43.520]  similar to what Joe Biden told us a few days before the election, that he had the best voter
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.920]  fraud team in the world. Well, they were good. I don't know that they were that good because
[14:49.920 --> 14:57.840]  they made significant mistakes, like all crooks do, and we caught them. One of them was pushing out
[14:57.840 --> 15:08.320]  Republican inspectors. Every state, almost every civilized country, even Tanzania and places
[15:08.320 --> 15:15.600]  you wouldn't think of, have rules about inspectors, particularly from mail-in ballots. And why
[15:15.600 --> 15:20.400]  particularly from mail-in ballots? Because they can more easily be defrauded and you can't check
[15:20.400 --> 15:25.520]  them. I don't want to give radio stations and TV stations a chance to either break away or carry
[15:25.520 --> 15:28.800]  this because we're going to go ahead and go commercial-free during this press conference,
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.680]  but we'll still fire tones for radio stations to play their ads. But M4's network is going
[15:33.680 --> 15:39.360]  commercial-free right now, back to Rudolph Giuliani. And the precinct in which you're voting.
[15:39.360 --> 15:46.240]  You fill out your name and your address, and you sign it. You then use an inner envelope,
[15:46.240 --> 15:52.160]  and you put the ballot inside the inner envelope. You seal it all, and you send it in. When it's
[15:52.160 --> 16:00.480]  being counted, almost invariably in the United States, up until the mass cheating that went on
[16:00.480 --> 16:06.160]  in this election, a Republican and a Democrat inspector, as well as others, if there are other
[16:06.160 --> 16:14.800]  parties, is allowed to watch the unsealing of this ballot. Used to go on all over America
[16:14.800 --> 16:21.600]  when we conducted an honest elections. Because the only time you can ever find out if it's a
[16:21.600 --> 16:28.640]  fraudulent ballot is when it is looked at, the minute you approve this, it's thrown away,
[16:29.520 --> 16:35.760]  gone for eternity. The only thing left is to vote. That could have been Mickey Mouse.
[16:35.760 --> 16:41.120]  That could have been a dead person. That could have been not filled out properly. That could have
[16:41.120 --> 16:47.040]  been the same person 30 times. That could have been, and all these things have happened, by the way,
[16:47.920 --> 16:55.600]  that could have been nothing filled out. We never know. So, for example, the recount being
[16:55.600 --> 17:02.080]  done in Georgia will tell us nothing, because these fraudulent ballots will just be counted again,
[17:02.080 --> 17:08.320]  because they wouldn't supply the signatures to match the ballots. So it means nothing to have
[17:08.320 --> 17:14.320]  counted these ballots, because, for example, in Pennsylvania, where we have probably our most
[17:14.320 --> 17:22.880]  precise evidence, 682,770 of these ballots were cast, put in, and they weren't inspected,
[17:24.320 --> 17:30.640]  which renders them ballots that are null and void, cannot be counted, have to be removed from the
[17:30.640 --> 17:41.520]  vote. Why? For several reasons, not the least of which is, that was basically only one of two
[17:41.520 --> 17:47.760]  places in the state where it was done. So in the other parts of the state, there was a legitimate
[17:47.760 --> 17:52.480]  inspection of the ballots. So if you have two different standards in different parts of the
[17:52.480 --> 17:58.240]  state, one favoring one part of the state, the other disfavoring the other part of the state,
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.080]  that's a classic violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution,
[18:03.200 --> 18:08.720]  Bush v. Gore being the most recent case that teaches that.
[18:11.040 --> 18:16.240]  That's not the only fraud that went on in Pennsylvania. All of the other frauds carried
[18:16.240 --> 18:23.920]  out in the other states by the Democrat bosses happen there as well. For example,
[18:23.920 --> 18:32.880]  if you've made a mistake in that ballot and you lived in Philadelphia or in Pittsburgh,
[18:34.480 --> 18:40.880]  you were allowed to fix the mistake. But if you lived in what would be considered more
[18:42.000 --> 18:47.040]  Republican or Trump parts of the state, you were given no such a right.
[18:47.040 --> 18:56.720]  And one of our plaintiffs, Mr. Henry, cast a absentee ballot and he failed to put it in the
[18:58.400 --> 19:07.920]  secure envelope inside. He just put it in open, naked. That ballot was cast aside because it
[19:07.920 --> 19:19.440]  was invalid because that breaks the privacy of the vote. In Pittsburgh and in Philadelphia,
[19:20.320 --> 19:24.480]  if they noticed that there wasn't an inner envelope, they'd contact the voter and allow
[19:24.480 --> 19:29.360]  him to vote again. Or if he didn't fill it out completely, or if he made a mistake and didn't
[19:29.360 --> 19:34.880]  sign his full name, he was allowed to cure it. There is no such provision under the law of
[19:34.880 --> 19:41.440]  Pennsylvania. The Democrat Secretary of State made that up in order to maximize the votes in
[19:41.440 --> 19:46.240]  Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and to minimize the votes in the other parts of the state.
[19:46.240 --> 19:53.440]  Clearly illegal, clearly voter fraud, easily provable, hundreds of witnesses, maybe thousands.
[19:54.560 --> 20:01.600]  We have, to give you another example, we have 17,000 provisional ballots cast in Pittsburgh.
[20:01.600 --> 20:07.840]  Do you know what a provisional ballot is? A provisional ballot usually happens this way and
[20:07.840 --> 20:14.000]  about 15 of the 17,000 happen this way. You walk in and you say, I'm here to vote today.
[20:16.720 --> 20:23.920]  Oh, Mr. Giuliani, you already voted. I did. I don't remember voting. Oh, yes, yes,
[20:23.920 --> 20:28.880]  you cast an absentee ballot. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. Yes, you did.
[20:28.880 --> 20:36.560]  But so why does that happen 17,000 times in Pittsburgh? People walked in thinking
[20:37.920 --> 20:44.160]  they actually 15,000 to be precise. Why did it happen 15,000 times that people in Pittsburgh
[20:44.160 --> 20:53.200]  walked in to vote and they had already voted according to the Democrat election machine?
[20:53.200 --> 21:01.120]  Did they forget? By the way, ladies and gentlemen, this happened to Republican voters in our office
[21:01.680 --> 21:05.280]  when they would try to vote. Oh, sorry, you can't. A lot of times they didn't tell you
[21:05.280 --> 21:08.560]  it's because somebody voted in their name. That happened to people I personally know in Austin
[21:08.560 --> 21:12.320]  as well that had moved from California. They went look on the secretary of state. They voted for
[21:12.320 --> 21:17.040]  Hillary. They voted for Biden email. They never voted for them and they live in Texas. I mean,
[21:17.040 --> 21:23.120]  this is just massive. My brother-in-law was in Austin at the major post office on Congress
[21:23.120 --> 21:27.360]  he came on the show about it and saw a guy with 50 ballots there at the election with his name
[21:27.360 --> 21:31.840]  with them accepting each one from him and taking a picture of himself to get paid. I mean, this
[21:31.840 --> 21:36.880]  was industrial fraud and I'm sure this president is going to go for hours. He's still in one state
[21:36.880 --> 21:45.280]  right now. Let's continue. The 50 to 60 witnesses we have for the way they were treated and not
[21:45.280 --> 21:52.000]  allowed to inspect the ballots. They weren't just not allowed to do it. They were pushed
[21:52.000 --> 22:01.120]  a few cases. They were assaulted in all cases. They were put in a corral so far away. Probably
[22:01.120 --> 22:07.760]  the closest they got is from here to the back of that room. We could do like a, did you all
[22:07.760 --> 22:13.440]  watch my cousin Vinnie? Do you know the movie? It's one of my favorite movies because he comes
[22:13.440 --> 22:20.000]  from Brooklyn. And when the nice lady who said she saw and then he, he says to her,
[22:20.000 --> 22:28.000]  how many fingers do I have? How many fingers do I got up? And she says three. Well, she was too far
[22:28.000 --> 22:34.400]  away to see it was only two. These people were further away than my cousin Vinnie was from the
[22:34.400 --> 22:40.240]  witness. They couldn't see a thing. Now, I don't know. You're going to tell me that 60 people are
[22:40.240 --> 22:46.800]  lying. They didn't just tell me this. They swore on the penalty of perjury, which is something
[22:46.800 --> 22:54.640]  no Democrats have ever done. You don't even ask Biden about this. You don't put them under penalty
[22:54.640 --> 23:00.080]  of perjury. He doesn't even get asked questions about. He doesn't get asked questions about
[23:00.880 --> 23:07.040]  all the evidence of the crime city commit. These people are under penalty of perjury.
[23:07.040 --> 23:14.720]  Their names are on NASA David. They swear that they weren't allowed to carry out their function
[23:14.720 --> 23:20.080]  as inspectors. And it's not just a technical thing. There's a reason they did it. And again,
[23:20.080 --> 23:25.040]  folks, it's not just that they swear it. We have video in Michigan, video in Wisconsin, video in
[23:25.040 --> 23:30.320]  Georgia, video in Pennsylvania, of them boarding up the windows and assaulting people and throwing
[23:30.320 --> 23:37.440]  a mountain violation of law. Continue. You were going to use those ballots to catch Biden up.
[23:37.440 --> 23:43.840]  And you had a big road ahead of you. You had to catch him up for 700,000 to 800,000 votes that he
[23:43.840 --> 23:50.560]  was behind. And the only way you were going to do it were with the mail-in ballots. You couldn't
[23:50.560 --> 23:55.920]  have a Democrat and Republican inspector around. They don't even have Democrats watching
[23:55.920 --> 23:59.920]  because they'd be afraid that they'd be honest Democrats who would say, you're cheating.
[23:59.920 --> 24:07.840]  So that takes us to Michigan, where there was an honest Democrat who said they were cheating.
[24:07.840 --> 24:18.400]  And we'll show you her affidavit because I know you keep reporting falsely that we have no evidence,
[24:18.400 --> 24:24.240]  that we have no specific acts of fraud. That's because the coverage of this has been almost
[24:24.240 --> 24:30.160]  as dishonest as the scheme itself. The American people are entitled to know this. You don't have
[24:30.160 --> 24:36.160]  a right to keep it from them. You don't have a right to lie about it. And you are. I mean,
[24:36.160 --> 24:42.960]  you don't report to them that a citizen of this country, a very fine woman who is willing to allow
[24:42.960 --> 24:51.440]  me to give you her name. I can't give you all these affidavits because if I do, these people
[24:51.440 --> 24:59.120]  will be harassed. They'll be threatened. They may lose their job. They will lose their friends.
[24:59.120 --> 25:03.360]  We've lost lawyers in this case because they've been threatened. We've had lawyers that need
[25:03.360 --> 25:10.400]  protection. What's going on in this country is horrible. And the censorship that you're imposing
[25:10.400 --> 25:18.320]  is making it worse. But Jesse Jacob is an adult citizen and a resident of the state of Michigan.
[25:18.320 --> 25:24.160]  She's been an employee of the city of Detroit for decades. I know her age, but
[25:26.800 --> 25:36.000]  she can tell you her age. She was assigned to voting duties in September. And she was trained
[25:36.000 --> 25:43.200]  by the city of Detroit and the state of Michigan. She's basically trained to cheat. She said that
[25:43.200 --> 25:49.840]  I was instructed by my supervisor to adjust the mailing date of these absentee ballot packages
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.960]  to be dated earlier than when they were actually sent in. The supervisor made that announcement
[25:56.960 --> 26:04.640]  for all workers to engage in that fraudulent practice. That's not me saying that. That's
[26:04.640 --> 26:11.040]  just American citizens saying that. Same thing to Georgia. I don't know. Maybe you could say
[26:11.040 --> 26:17.360]  she's lying. But you can't say there's no evidence. This is what we call evidence. This is direct
[26:17.360 --> 26:23.520]  evidence. That's circumstantial. I tried many, many cases, as did all my colleagues here.
[26:23.520 --> 26:27.600]  You put a witness on a witness stand. A witness is testifying to their own knowledge.
[26:27.600 --> 26:33.600]  That's boosting to a witness stand. And she will say, I was told to adjust the date on the
[26:33.600 --> 26:42.880]  absentee ballots. I witnessed election workers and employees going over to the voting booths
[26:42.880 --> 26:50.960]  with voters in order to watch them vote and coach them for whom to vote. Completely.
[26:52.160 --> 26:58.320]  She will testify to that. I don't know. Biden's people can cross examiner. But you can't just
[26:58.320 --> 27:04.240]  throw it away. Gee, there's no evidence. Next time you say that, you'll be lying.
[27:04.240 --> 27:11.440]  In Michigan, in Detroit, them teaching a class on how to not let people watch and how to take
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.360]  ballots that came in late and say that they came in on time. It's all on damn video.
[27:17.360 --> 27:21.040]  And then the Democrats that run the state call up threatening the journalists that cover it with
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.200]  jail time. These are criminals, folks. We've caught them red-handed. I'm just backing up Giuliani
[27:25.200 --> 27:29.920]  here. We have the frickin' video of this continue. When a person was trying to vote,
[27:32.880 --> 27:38.560]  don't ask for identification. Why would you not ask for identification? Because you knew
[27:39.280 --> 27:42.880]  that a lot of people not entitled to vote were going to come in an early vote.
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.600]  Because you knew that illegal immigrants were going to be allowed to vote. You knew if you lived
[27:49.600 --> 27:55.760]  in Philadelphia, unless you're Stunard, that's an Italian expression for stupid. Unless you're stupid,
[27:55.760 --> 27:59.600]  you knew that a lot of people were coming over from Camden to vote. They do every year.
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.640]  Happens all the time in Philly. It's about as frequent as getting beaten up at a
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.040]  Philadelphia Eagle basketball, football game. Happens all the time. All the time.
[28:10.080 --> 28:16.800]  And it's allowed to happen because it is a Democrat corrupt city and has been for years.
[28:16.800 --> 28:23.200]  Many, many years. And they carried it out in places they could get away with it.
[28:24.400 --> 28:29.040]  They didn't carry it out in neutral places. They didn't carry it out in Republican places.
[28:29.040 --> 28:33.440]  They didn't carry it out where the law is respected. They carried it out in corrupt,
[28:33.440 --> 28:38.640]  a corrupt city where the District Attorney releases criminals on mass, which is why it has
[28:38.640 --> 28:45.040]  so much crime. She also said, I observed a large number of people who came to the
[28:45.040 --> 28:51.040]  satellite location of voting person, but they had already applied for and submitted an absentee
[28:51.040 --> 29:03.680]  ballot. So she observed a lot of people voting twice. Again, this is Jesse Jacob, not me.
[29:03.680 --> 29:13.360]  I was instructed not to invalidate any ballots and not to look for any deficiency in the ballots.
[29:16.240 --> 29:21.680]  Why would you do that? Because you're cheating. On purpose, cheating. Intentionally,
[29:21.680 --> 29:28.560]  cheating. You're cheating as an institution. This is an instruction from the election
[29:28.560 --> 29:35.760]  commissioner or the employer to the worker. Don't look for any deficiencies in the ballots.
[29:36.480 --> 29:41.440]  I was instructed not to look in any of the signatures of the absentee ballots.
[29:42.880 --> 29:47.600]  If she was instructed not to look for any of the signatures on the absentee ballots,
[29:48.800 --> 29:54.480]  why the heck do you sign it in the first place in order to identify it? She was instructed not
[29:54.480 --> 29:59.920]  to do that because many of the absentee ballots were fraudulent and they knew that and they didn't
[29:59.920 --> 30:07.360]  want to have a count of that. On November 4, 2020, I was instructed to improperly pre-date
[30:08.160 --> 30:16.960]  the absentee ballots when the receipt date was actually November, was after November 3, 2020.
[30:16.960 --> 30:24.320]  Now, this is really significant because Justice Delito of the Supreme Court instructed Pennsylvania
[30:25.840 --> 30:33.120]  that any ballot that comes in after 8 o'clock on November 3, 2020 had to be put aside and not
[30:33.120 --> 30:39.280]  opened because there's a question as to its legality and its constitutionality. What she's
[30:39.280 --> 30:45.760]  telling you is that they blatantly disregarded that order, that they took ballots that were marked the
[30:45.760 --> 30:52.160]  fourth and the fifth and the sixth and they marked it down for the third in blatant disregard
[30:52.160 --> 30:57.920]  of the order of the United States Supreme Court. I don't know if she's a Democrat or Republican.
[30:58.960 --> 31:05.840]  I assume if she's working for the, I assume if she's working for the city of Detroit,
[31:05.840 --> 31:12.800]  that she's a Democrat, I assume but I may be wrong. She's a citizen. I've never met her, never
[31:12.800 --> 31:22.160]  coached her and I'd like you to note that it's signed under penalties of perjury.
[31:25.040 --> 31:31.200]  We have a hundred more of these. I can't show them to you because those people don't want to be
[31:31.200 --> 31:38.080]  harassed. They don't want to have their lives torn apart by the goons on the other side.
[31:38.080 --> 31:44.640]  We don't do that to them. They've done that to a lot of our people. They've done it for four years
[31:45.840 --> 31:52.800]  and it's outrageous that it's tolerated and it's tolerated because you condone it in the press
[31:52.800 --> 31:57.680]  and you don't cover it and you don't condemn it and it shouldn't happen to a Republican or a Democrat.
[31:57.680 --> 32:02.080]  A lawyer shouldn't have to withdraw from a case because he's representing the president of the
[32:02.080 --> 32:10.160]  United States. There were many more affidavits here. I'd like to read them all to you but I don't
[32:10.160 --> 32:15.760]  have the time. You should have had the time in and that you to go look for them. That's your job.
[32:16.960 --> 32:21.600]  Like it's my job to defend the president and to represent the president. It's your job to read
[32:21.600 --> 32:27.040]  these things and not falsely report that there's no evidence. Do you know how many affidavits we
[32:27.040 --> 32:34.560]  have in the Michigan case? 220 affidavits. They're not all public but eight of them are. Four affiants
[32:34.560 --> 32:41.520]  here. Those are people who give affidavits. Report an incident that under any other circumstances
[32:41.520 --> 32:45.920]  would have been on the front page of all your newspapers if it didn't involve the hatred that
[32:45.920 --> 32:53.760]  you have, irrational pathological hatred that you have for the president. What they swear to
[32:53.760 --> 33:00.240]  is that at 4 30 in the morning a truck pulled up to the Detroit center where they were counting
[33:00.240 --> 33:08.560]  ballots. The people thought it was food so they all ran to the truck. It wasn't food. It was thousands
[33:08.560 --> 33:16.400]  and thousands of ballots and the ballots were in garbage cans. They were in paper bags. They were
[33:16.400 --> 33:22.000]  in cardboard boxes and they were taken into the center. They were put on a number of tables.
[33:22.000 --> 33:28.240]  At that time they thought all the Republican inspectors had left, all but two had,
[33:29.600 --> 33:37.200]  and an employee of Dominion who we'll address a little bit later, Dominion.
[33:37.200 --> 33:42.000]  Now remember folks, this is live coverage of the Giuliani path to victory Trump 2020
[33:42.960 --> 33:46.960]  powerful press conference. We're commercial free but some stations need to carry their ads
[33:46.960 --> 33:51.600]  because they're automated stations so we're firing the brakes and so some stations are not getting
[33:51.600 --> 33:56.240]  all this. The last three minutes was incredibly powerful. Giuliani just annihilating them with
[33:56.240 --> 34:00.480]  proof. We're going to continue on with live coverage as long as this goes. I'm in Georgia,
[34:00.480 --> 34:07.200]  stop the steal, I was back in the ATX. Let's continue. Very swiftly and they're estimated to be
[34:07.760 --> 34:16.080]  a minimum of 60,000 maximum of 100,000. Many of them were triple counted which means they were
[34:16.080 --> 34:22.240]  put into the counting machine this way. Once, twice, three times.
[34:24.160 --> 34:29.760]  I didn't see that. I don't know that but for the fact that three American citizens are willing to
[34:29.760 --> 34:36.160]  swear to it and we're not going to let them go to court and do that. We're going to let this
[34:36.160 --> 34:45.120]  election go by when there are in this case 60 witnesses that can prove what I'm saying to you
[34:45.120 --> 34:52.240]  and other acts of fraud in Michigan. What's happened to this country if we're going to let
[34:52.240 --> 34:58.160]  that happen? What happened to this country if we're going to cover that up? We let Al Gore carry on
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.920]  an election dispute longer than this one has been going on for one state and for Chad's.
[35:05.440 --> 35:12.320]  This happened in Pennsylvania. It happened in Michigan. Michigan probably right now.
[35:12.320 --> 35:19.360]  If I count up the affidavits, just one case alone, Trump v. Benson, a case that we dismissed today
[35:19.360 --> 35:27.280]  because that case was attempting to get the Wayne County Board of Supervisors to decertify.
[35:27.280 --> 35:36.960]  Well, they did. They decertify. That case has 100 affidavits and the 100 affidavits show essentially
[35:36.960 --> 35:44.320]  what I've talked to you about. Counting ballots improperly, counting them three and four times.
[35:44.320 --> 35:48.080]  A witness like an old lady with no criminal record that sees the neighbor kill his wife
[35:48.080 --> 35:51.840]  in the backyard. The guy goes to the gas chamber where he goes to lethal injection.
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.680]  Imagine per county, they have like hundreds of witnesses. I mean, this of like total complete
[35:57.680 --> 36:03.760]  fraud. I mean, I've had family witnesses in Austin. This is incredible. Trump won by a gigantic
[36:03.760 --> 36:11.520]  landslide. Continue. It's basically in Detroit that Biden won 80-20. So you see a change as a
[36:11.520 --> 36:17.920]  result of the election in Michigan if you take out Wayne County. So it's a very significant case.
[36:18.800 --> 36:24.640]  That is being raised in the case of Constantino versus the city of Detroit. Not by us, but by
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.800]  an individual plaintiff. We are helping and assisting in that case, however. And you can find all the
[36:30.800 --> 36:36.880]  affidavits that you want filed in that case. And you can find out they're not just allegations,
[36:36.880 --> 36:43.120]  they're allegations supported by sworn testimony, which is a lot better than Joe Biden has ever
[36:43.120 --> 36:49.120]  done on anything. He doesn't answer questions, much less giving a sworn affidavits. Wisconsin.
[36:50.240 --> 36:59.200]  Wisconsin had a very small margin, 20,544 last time I looked. In Wisconsin, without going into
[36:59.200 --> 37:06.800]  great detail, very similar plan. Republicans shut out in the city of Milwaukee and also in Madison.
[37:07.440 --> 37:13.920]  Republicans almost uniformly shut out from the absentee process, not allowed to inspect,
[37:13.920 --> 37:21.520]  not allowed to look at the ballots. We have in Milwaukee and in the state of Wisconsin
[37:21.520 --> 37:28.240]  a much stricter law. Wisconsin doesn't allow mail-in ballots. They didn't buy into the big mail-in
[37:28.240 --> 37:35.600]  ballot situation. Wisconsin, when you look at their constitution, almost seems to not like absentee
[37:35.600 --> 37:42.000]  ballots. They state it's not a right, a privilege. And they have very, very strict procedures.
[37:42.960 --> 37:48.960]  And the strict procedure says that you can't be given an absentee ballot. You have to personally
[37:48.960 --> 37:55.120]  apply for it. It's illegal, basically, to solicit a vote. And they have actually
[37:55.120 --> 38:02.800]  many reasons for it that probably goes back to their progressive days. When I say progressive,
[38:02.800 --> 38:08.960]  I mean late 19th century, early 20th century progressive, when that really meant progressive,
[38:08.960 --> 38:19.440]  not retrogressive. So there are 60,000 ballots in Milwaukee County and 40,000 ballots in Madison
[38:19.440 --> 38:27.360]  that, as far as we can tell, and this is why we're auditing because we have very good information
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.640]  that the numbers are going to come out about here that don't have applications,
[38:32.000 --> 38:38.880]  under the law of the state of Wisconsin already decided. If there's no application for an absentee
[38:38.880 --> 38:47.520]  ballot, the absentee ballot is thrown away. This all happened in two places in Wisconsin. Didn't
[38:47.520 --> 38:53.360]  happen in northern Wisconsin. Didn't happen in Republican Wisconsin. Didn't happen in neutral
[38:53.360 --> 38:58.560]  Wisconsin, where there are equal number of Republicans and Democrats. It happened in a
[38:58.560 --> 39:08.000]  place where the vote was 75, 80% for the Democrat. You take away any number of those and that 20,000
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.840]  lead disappears. In other words, if you count the lawful votes, Trump won Wisconsin by a good margin.
[39:15.840 --> 39:21.360]  Indeed, if you count the lawful votes in Pennsylvania, he won it by about 300,000 votes.
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.960]  Also, in the lawsuit filed in Wisconsin, which is really a petition because of their
[39:32.400 --> 39:37.040]  procedures, there were no inspectors provided for the count of the illegal ballots.
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.720]  You've got live, basically, commercial free coverage here of the Pats of Victory,
[39:42.720 --> 39:46.640]  Rudolf Giuliani press conference. This is going to go for hours. I made a lot of preparation.
[39:46.640 --> 39:51.600]  I'm not complaining of how to stop the great reset and just how draconian it is. And I went
[39:51.600 --> 39:57.520]  and pulled Klaus Schwab admitting to lockdown as nothing to do with COVID-19, but it's about,
[39:57.520 --> 40:02.240]  quote, ending inequity, which means bankrupting everybody making us poor and putting us under
[40:02.240 --> 40:07.680]  IMF World Bank Control. I'm going to come back with Nick Foyntes, J. Dyer, and Ali Alexander
[40:07.680 --> 40:13.440]  in the fourth hour and cover this. But I'm going to come back even earlier by myself with Owen and
[40:13.440 --> 40:17.520]  at least two 30 minutes on this because this is all unfolding now. And this is just as serious
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.400]  as the election theft. It's all the same globalist takeover of America. Trump was blocking all of
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.080]  this, but we got some good news as well. But I got to just say this where we won't be here.
[40:27.040 --> 40:31.760]  I'm not funded by the new world order. I'm not funded by any of these big globalist organizations.
[40:31.760 --> 40:37.360]  I'm funded by you. And I'm just asking you for your help. We have a big sale that I wasn't
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.240]  going to end Wednesday. It's got to be extended through the weekend because I'm just, I don't
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.280]  have a new sale to do. So much stuff is about to be sold out. It is to stop the steal in the
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.080]  criminal lockdown to super sale up to 60% off. Triple Patriot points, free shipping.

[41:49.680 --> 41:53.200]  And please keep praying for us in your word of mouth as paramount. Here's the good news.
[41:53.200 --> 41:56.880]  America's putting up a big fight. We're not letting Trump quit. We're not quitting regardless,
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.400]  even if he quits, which we don't think is going to happen, because the evidence is coming out.
[42:00.400 --> 42:03.760]  But most of Trump's campaigns quit. Most of the White House's quit and a selling amount.
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.000]  Giuliani isn't. Say what you want about Giuliani. He's not a coward. Here's Pompeo.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.560]  So we salute both of them. And I salute you all, because this is a firing global's takeover,
[42:12.560 --> 42:16.240]  but we need money to fight a war. These are great products. So it's a win-win.
[42:16.240 --> 42:21.520]  Infowarsstore.com, take action now and fund this operation. The Second American Revolution,
[42:21.520 --> 42:26.000]  so we can stay on air. Your support is critical. Back to Rudolph Giuliani.
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.120]  And then I will try to be taking over in between here into the next hour.
[42:32.400 --> 42:37.840]  Arizona is a state that we're looking at very, very carefully. I would say we're probably going
[42:37.840 --> 42:42.560]  to bring a lawsuit in Arizona more than probably. I think we are going to bring a lawsuit in Arizona.
[42:42.560 --> 42:46.960]  We're still collecting that evidence. And the state that we're looking at that would surprise
[42:46.960 --> 42:53.840]  you is we have very, very significant amount of fraud allegations in the state of New Mexico,
[42:53.840 --> 43:03.040]  which is. And we have a significant number of allegations in the state of Virginia. I don't
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.000]  know yet whether the number in Virginia will reach the number that can turn the election.
[43:08.560 --> 43:15.120]  In the states that we have indicated in red, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada,
[43:15.120 --> 43:22.160]  and Arizona, we more than double the number of votes needed to overturn the election in terms of
[43:22.160 --> 43:30.160]  provable, illegal ballots. All you got to do to find out if I'm misleading you at all is to look
[43:30.160 --> 43:37.040]  at the lawsuits. Look what's alleged. Look at the affidavits. Maybe we can supply more affidavits
[43:37.040 --> 43:41.040]  in order to do it. I have to get permission from the people. But in the materials I have here,
[43:41.040 --> 43:48.960]  there are at least 10 that come from citizens. We have a thousand at least. And we're getting
[43:48.960 --> 43:55.120]  more every day. And there are other aspects of this fraud that at this point, I really can't
[43:55.120 --> 44:01.600]  reveal. This is really enough. It's enough to overturn any election. It's disgraceful what
[44:01.600 --> 44:07.600]  happened. And I'll conclude by asking you to just think about this for a minute. What happened on
[44:07.600 --> 44:14.720]  the morning of November 3rd when they were going to count this new kind of ballot, this mail-in
[44:14.720 --> 44:24.800]  ballot? Did every Democrat leader in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and in Georgia
[44:25.680 --> 44:32.000]  and in Nevada and in Arizona, they all wake up and all separately have the same idea?
[44:33.040 --> 44:39.600]  Did they all separately have the idea that we are going to put public and systematically
[44:39.600 --> 44:46.160]  everywhere? We're not going to let them look at mail-in or absentee ballots. They all independently
[44:46.160 --> 44:52.080]  come up with that. Like just by coincidence. They say, hey, you know, we're going to put,
[44:53.280 --> 44:57.680]  we're going to put the Republicans in pens and corrals. We're going to do it in Pittsburgh,
[44:57.680 --> 45:02.000]  we're going to do it in Philadelphia. We're going to do it in Detroit. We're going to do it in
[45:02.000 --> 45:08.960]  Milwaukee. We're going to do it in Las Vegas. We're going to do it in Phoenix. What did I miss?
[45:08.960 --> 45:18.240]  Oh, we can do it in Atlanta. Or isn't the logical conclusion that I think any jury would accept
[45:18.240 --> 45:23.680]  as they heard this evidence that somebody had this plan? Maybe that was always the plan
[45:24.880 --> 45:29.920]  to do these, this very, very questionable form of voting, which has been criticized.
[45:29.920 --> 45:34.000]  Yes, this is an organized, concerted fraud. It's the same everywhere. That's why Pelosi said
[45:34.000 --> 45:38.160]  Trump will not win. We don't care about what's happening next week. Biden will be put in.
[45:38.160 --> 45:42.480]  It's why we have the inside of Antibio folks at Dominion saying it doesn't matter. He will win.
[45:42.480 --> 45:47.520]  It was organized like all the other organized fraud and the media not letting anybody question
[45:47.520 --> 45:52.800]  and blocking witnesses, even including official poll watchers who came out. They were all censored
[45:52.800 --> 45:56.720]  by the internet. They were all censored by big tech. That's an organized criminal syndicate.
[45:56.720 --> 46:00.880]  And mainstream media and big tech have been complicit in trying to overthrow our country.
[46:00.880 --> 46:04.800]  This is our country fighting for its damn life. This is war. Back to Giuliani.
[46:04.800 --> 46:11.360]  This is why he probably didn't have to go out and campaign. He had to have known what they
[46:11.360 --> 46:17.200]  were going to do. This had to be planned in advance. I'm kind of checking. Did they go,
[46:17.200 --> 46:21.920]  you know, to the same contractor to get the corrals to put the Republicans in?
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.440]  And this is a disgraceful thing that was done in this country. Probably not much more.
[46:28.640 --> 46:32.800]  You hear with Giuliani how he's finishing my sentences. We didn't talk. It's the truth.
[46:32.800 --> 46:37.680]  This is organized fraud. Biden didn't even need a campaign. He even said in a speech,
[46:37.680 --> 46:40.560]  I don't need your votes. I'm going to win. Remember that? I don't need your votes.
[46:40.560 --> 46:44.640]  In fact, find that clip. Oh, and play that next hour a bunch. Back to Giuliani. We got to get
[46:44.640 --> 46:48.240]  this whole press conference up. This is powerful. Continue. We're going to become Venezuela.
[46:49.280 --> 46:55.360]  We cannot let this happen to us. We cannot allow these crooks, because that's what they are,
[46:56.080 --> 46:59.840]  to steal an election from the American people. They elected Donald Trump.
[46:59.840 --> 47:08.720]  They didn't elect Joe Biden. Joe Biden is in the lead because of the fraudulent ballots,
[47:09.520 --> 47:17.040]  the illegal ballots that were produced and that were allowed to be used after the election was
[47:17.040 --> 47:24.400]  over. That's right. Give us an opportunity to prove it in court, and we will. Now I'm going to ask
[47:24.400 --> 47:34.320]  Cindy Powell to describe to you what we can describe about another totally outrageous situation.
[47:34.880 --> 47:39.840]  I don't think most Americans know that our ballots get calculated, many of them outside
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.640]  the United States, and are completely open to hacking, completely open to change,
[47:44.640 --> 47:54.560]  and it's being done by a company that specializes in voter fraud. I'll let Cindy describe that to
[47:54.560 --> 48:07.200]  you. Thank you, Rudy. What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day is the
[48:07.200 --> 48:15.920]  massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China in the
[48:15.920 --> 48:22.880]  interference with our elections here in the United States. The Dominion voting systems,
[48:22.880 --> 48:29.600]  the smartmatic technology software, and the software that goes in other computerized voting
[48:29.600 --> 48:37.840]  systems here as well, not just Dominion, were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo
[48:37.840 --> 48:44.160]  Chavez to make sure he never lost an election after one constitutional referendum came out the way
[48:44.160 --> 48:52.720]  he did not want it to come out. This is all true. This is a communist Chinese, globalist takeover
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.520]  with criminals in our government. China, Joe, this is the truth. It's a fact that it was tabulated
[48:57.520 --> 49:02.720]  in Venezuela and in Germany, and it's all coming out. We cannot give up because this is a foreign
[49:02.720 --> 49:07.040]  takeover. This is war, and they can't take us down with a frontal attack. They can only take
[49:07.040 --> 49:11.520]  us down from within, and this is it. And right now, we're getting taken down, folks. We're getting
[49:11.520 --> 49:16.080]  taken down, and they're saying the economy will never be turned on again, will be totally bankrupt
[49:16.080 --> 49:21.680]  forever, and have communism and own nothing, but the bankers will be offshore in jumbo jets with
[49:21.680 --> 49:26.240]  private islands. I mean, this is a James Bond movie for real. I'm going to hand this over to Owen
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.600]  Schreuer. We'll do as much commercial free as we can into the next hour, then I'll be back later
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.080]  right now on how we fight back at the heart of this and start calling for the arrest of the
[49:36.080 --> 49:40.560]  Davos globalist on top that are doing this, so the public knows who's behind this. Because our
[49:40.560 --> 49:44.240]  real power is we can predict what's coming next. We'll go back to the rest of the press conference
[49:44.240 --> 49:48.720]  with Owen Schreuer, and I'll be back later here in the next few hours. Please stay with us and
[49:48.720 --> 49:53.440]  send the links out to band.video and infowars.com and newswars.com. That's the chain reaction,
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.680]  say America's fighting back. We discovered the fraud, find out what's censored, find out what
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.760]  MSN doesn't want you to see, find out how we saved the country and ourselves, and send that link on
[50:01.760 --> 50:06.400]  your email, text message word of mouth now, send the live feed out back to the live feed.
[50:07.040 --> 50:12.880]  So overwhelming in so many of these states that it broke the algorithm that had been
[50:12.880 --> 50:18.240]  plugged into the system, and that's what caused them to have to shut down in the states they
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.880]  shut down in. That's when they came in the back door with all the mail-in, mail-in ballots,
[50:24.880 --> 50:31.360]  many of which they had actually fabricated. Some were on pristine paper with identically matching
[50:32.240 --> 50:40.480]  perfect circle dots for Mr. Biden. Others were shoved in in batches. They're always put in a
[50:40.480 --> 50:46.960]  certain number of batches and people would rerun the same batch. This corresponds to our statistical
[50:46.960 --> 50:53.680]  evidence that shows incredible spikes in the vote counts at particular times, and that corresponds
[50:53.680 --> 50:59.600]  to eyewitness testimony of numerous people who have come forward and said they saw the ballots
[50:59.600 --> 51:07.680]  come in the back door at that time. Notably, the Dominion executives are nowhere to be found now.
[51:07.680 --> 51:13.440]  They are moving their offices overnight to different places. Their office in Toronto was
[51:13.440 --> 51:20.000]  shared with one of the Soros entities. One of the leaders of the Dominion project in
[51:20.960 --> 51:30.080]  overall is Lord Malik Brown, Mr. Soros number two person in the UK and part of his organization.
[51:30.080 --> 51:36.160]  There are ties of the Dominion leadership to the Clinton Foundation and to other
[51:36.160 --> 51:42.720]  known politicians in this country. Just to give you a brief description of how this worked,
[51:42.720 --> 51:50.640]  I'm going to quote from a letter that was written and I will read that to make sure I get the
[51:50.640 --> 51:57.040]  quotes right. This person was objecting to the United States acquisition of Sequoia Voting Systems
[51:57.040 --> 52:02.720]  by Smartmatic, a foreign-owned company. I believe this transaction raises exactly the
[52:02.720 --> 52:07.840]  sort of foreign ownership issues that SIFIUS is best positioned to examine for national
[52:07.840 --> 52:13.840]  security purposes. It's undisputed that Smartmatic is foreign-owned and it is acquired Sequoia.
[52:13.840 --> 52:18.240]  They keep changing the names as they go along. Different times when a problem comes up,
[52:18.240 --> 52:23.760]  they just create another corporation and call it a different name. But it was a voting machine
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.120]  company doing business in the United States. Sequoia Voting Machines were used to record
[52:29.120 --> 52:34.960]  over 125 million votes during the 2004 presidential election in the United States.
[52:34.960 --> 52:42.800]  Smartmatic now acknowledges that Antonio Mujica, a Venezuelan businessman, has controlling interest
[52:42.800 --> 52:48.320]  in Smartmatic, but the company has not revealed who all the Smartmatic owners are. According to
[52:48.320 --> 52:54.000]  the press, Smartmatic's owners are hidden through a web of offshore private entities, and that is
[52:54.000 --> 53:00.240]  in fact true. Smartmatic has been associated with the Venezuelan government led by Hugo Chavez,
[53:00.240 --> 53:05.760]  which is openly hostile to the United States, and of course, as we all know, communistic and
[53:06.560 --> 53:13.440]  really brutalizing its own people. The system has been continued there by Mr. Maduro and ensured
[53:13.440 --> 53:19.120]  his election. Smartmatic's possible connection to the Venezuelan government poses a potential
[53:19.120 --> 53:24.400]  national security concern in the context of its acquisition of Sequoia because electronic voting
[53:24.400 --> 53:30.560]  machines are susceptible to tampering, and insiders are in the best position to engage in such tampering.
[53:30.560 --> 53:38.240]  This letter expresses concern of the Chicago 2006 primary election, and it ends by saying the
[53:38.240 --> 53:43.200]  products and services that are of Venezuelan origin and evaluate Smartmatic's ownership to
[53:43.200 --> 53:48.800]  determine who could have influence and control over these and other Sequoia products and services
[53:48.800 --> 53:53.920]  are important to the national security of the United States. This letter was written to Hank
[53:53.920 --> 54:07.200]  Paulson on October 6, 2006 by Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney. Senators Klobuchar and Warren
[54:07.200 --> 54:13.520]  have raised these concerns as recently as December 2019. Why our government has not taken them
[54:13.520 --> 54:19.600]  seriously is beyond my comprehension unless they have some of the three letter agencies have used
[54:19.600 --> 54:25.040]  them themselves in other parts of the world. We know that the technology was exported to
[54:25.040 --> 54:31.280]  affect an election in Argentina that's admitted by our friend who wrote the affidavit about Hugo
[54:31.280 --> 54:40.800]  Chavez and his interest in Smartmatic. Again, in 2006, Carolyn Maloney wrote The Honorable John
[54:40.800 --> 54:50.400]  No, the Secretary of the Treasury about the issues. Speaking of Smartmatic's leadership, one of the
[54:50.400 --> 54:58.240]  Smartmatic patent holders, Eric Kumer, I believe his name is, is on the web as being recorded in
[54:58.240 --> 55:06.960]  a conversation with Antifa members saying that he had the election rigged for Mr. Biden, nothing to
[55:06.960 --> 55:14.640]  worry about here and he was going to, they were going to F Trump. His social media is filled with
[55:14.640 --> 55:20.560]  hatred for the president and for the United States of America as a whole, as are the social media
[55:20.560 --> 55:28.240]  accounts of many other Smartmatic people. There has been widespread use of this. Dominion itself
[55:28.240 --> 55:35.200]  is utilized in 2,000 jurisdictions in 30 states. It has been uncertifiable in multiple states who
[55:35.200 --> 55:41.440]  realized all the problems that it had, including Texas. Experts have described it across the board
[55:41.440 --> 55:49.440]  from a Princeton group of three professors to experts that we have talked to about its end-user
[55:49.440 --> 55:55.760]  vulnerabilities. People can admittedly go in and change whatever they want. They can set the ratio
[55:55.760 --> 56:02.960]  of votes from one thing to another. They can say that a Biden vote counts as 1.25 and a Trump vote
[56:02.960 --> 56:09.840]  counts as 0.75. And those may be the numbers that were actually used here. It's not just the swing
[56:09.840 --> 56:15.680]  states that were affected. The algorithm was likely run across the country to affect the entire
[56:15.680 --> 56:22.560]  election. Like I said, we only discovered it this year because of the overwhelming number of votes
[56:22.560 --> 56:28.160]  for President Trump in the swing states that caused the machines to have to shut down for them to
[56:28.160 --> 56:35.360]  backfill for adding votes. We have evidence of different numbers of votes being injected into
[56:35.360 --> 56:42.800]  the system, the same identical unique six-digit number multiple times in at least two states
[56:42.800 --> 56:51.920]  that we've analyzed so far. And I'm talking about like 341,542 votes for Biden and 100,012 for Trump.
[56:51.920 --> 56:57.840]  There's no explanation, no logical explanation for the same numbers being injected 20 minutes
[56:57.840 --> 57:05.520]  apart into the machine. The software manual itself, you can download it from the internet.
[57:05.520 --> 57:10.640]  And I would encourage you all to read it because it specifically advertises some of these things as
[57:10.640 --> 57:17.600]  features of the system. Why it was ever allowed into this country is beyond my comprehension.
[57:17.600 --> 57:23.760]  And why nobody has dealt with it is absolutely appalling. The machines were easily accessible
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.920]  to hackers. There's video on the net that it will explain to you how a kid with a cell phone can
[57:29.920 --> 57:35.600]  hack one of these voting machines. There's been no oversight of Dominion or its software.
[57:35.600 --> 57:38.720]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to continue this uninterrupted coverage of this
[57:38.720 --> 57:42.960]  historic press conference. We have to take this top of the hour break, though. It's two minutes
[57:42.960 --> 57:48.960]  and we'll be right back live with Sidney Powell. Alex Jones here with an important message. All
[57:48.960 --> 57:51.760]  of our listeners and viewers, I want to thank you for your support over the years. I want to thank
[57:51.760 --> 57:57.360]  you for having skin in the game and no one has had more skin in the game than our president. And he
[57:57.360 --> 58:02.720]  needs our prayers. He needs our support. He is the president. Secretary of State Pompeo understands
[58:02.720 --> 58:07.760]  that's why he said yesterday there will be a smooth transition from this Trump administration
[58:07.760 --> 58:13.520]  into the next administration because in all the major states where they're still counting,
[58:13.520 --> 58:18.160]  they are gaining ground. That is President Trump, Republican Party, the American people,
[58:18.160 --> 58:23.440]  the populace, the patriots, the enemy, the Democrats, backed by the chai comms, backed by the European
[58:23.440 --> 58:27.920]  Union, backed by Hollywood, backed by the left, the blue cities, the blue states. They are in a
[58:27.920 --> 58:33.840]  rage trying to gaslight us, keep calling Biden president elect. He's not. President has to concede
[58:33.840 --> 58:38.480]  and or all of the states have to certify the vote, which hasn't happened yet. And then you have to
[58:38.480 --> 58:43.360]  have the electors to seek who is going to be the president. And this may be a dispute that goes
[58:43.360 --> 58:46.960]  back to the states. That's why it's in the Constitution and the Constitution's kicking in.
[58:48.480 --> 58:53.440]  Communist China has been fully open for business for more than six months. But the European Union
[58:53.440 --> 58:58.240]  and every other major Western nation is still under some form of lockdown. And the lockdowns are
[58:58.240 --> 59:02.320]  getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested and they leave their
[59:02.320 --> 59:08.720]  houses just like we've seen in Australia. You see, the authoritarians want total control.
[59:08.720 --> 59:13.120]  And because they don't respect this, because the general public puts up with so much abuse,
[59:13.120 --> 59:17.840]  they're going for broke. Why shouldn't they? They never get in trouble for the big illegal wars,
[59:17.840 --> 59:21.760]  they never get in trouble for the Chinese slave camps, they never get in trouble for all the
[59:21.760 --> 59:26.400]  terrible exploitation in Africa. They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly
[59:26.400 --> 59:32.800]  drugs into our country. And so why shouldn't they go for broke? Because so many people are domesticated
[59:32.800 --> 59:37.440]  and they're soft. And they have Stockholm syndrome. They love their abusers. They can't
[59:37.440 --> 59:42.160]  believe they're being lied to. They can't believe they're being conned. And so they're going into
[59:42.160 --> 59:57.440]  bondage. You see, there's always a minority that says no. An infomerse is that minority.
[1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:08.960]  Sidney Powell is live. Rudy Giuliani eviscerated the Democrat voter fraud for an hour. I had to
[1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:14.480]  stand and applause. Sidney Powell is up to bat now and she's doing the same thing. Let's go back
[1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:22.320]  live to this historic press conference. We know specifically that Venezuela exported it for that
[1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:27.680]  purpose to Argentina and other Latin American companies to make sure that the corrupt rulers
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:34.320]  who were willing to pay the highest price for being in office were allowed to rig their elections.
[1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:48.480]  This is stunning, heartbreaking, infuriating, and the most unpatriotic acts I can even imagine for
[1:00:48.480 --> 1:00:54.640]  people in this country to have participated in in any way, shape, or form. And I want the American
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:01:01.040]  public to know right now that we will not be intimidated. American patriots are fed up with
[1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:07.600]  the corruption from the local level to the highest level of our government. And we are going to take
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:13.280]  this country back. We are not going to be intimidated. We are not going to back down. We are
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:20.640]  going to clean this mess up now. President Trump won by a landslide. We are going to prove it. And
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:25.840]  we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:35.200]  How come you are not suing in the Wisconsin county that uses it? Why are you only doing a
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:38.800]  excuse me that we are not out to the questions at this point?
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:43.760]  So excuse me, we are not at the questions at this point. My name is Jenna Ellis and I am the
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:48.480]  senior legal advisor to the Trump campaign. So a Democrat hack obviously in the audience
[1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:53.120]  trying to scuttle this. It is not going to work. Where we are at and what you can expect from this
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:59.280]  process. So what you have heard, I am sure, in the fake newspapers tomorrow will be one of two
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:04.960]  things. Either there was not sufficient evidence that we have presented or we spoke too long.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:12.640]  So what you have heard now is basically an opening statement. This is what you can expect to see
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:19.440]  when we get to court to actually have a full trial on the merits to actually show this evidence
[1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:25.200]  in court and prove our case. This is not a law and order episode where everything is neatly
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:31.760]  wrapped up in 60 minutes. For those of you who are here in this room or have maybe tuned out
[1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:37.680]  in other networks, clearly you have never been court reporters. Trials take time. Putting on
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:42.960]  evidence takes time. This is basically an opening statement so the American people can understand
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:48.400]  what the networks have been hiding and what they refuse to cover because all of your fake news
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:55.040]  headlines are dancing around the merits of this case and are trying to delegitimize what we are
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:03:01.600]  doing here. Let me be very clear that our objective is to make sure to preserve and protect election
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:08.080]  integrity. President Trump has been saying from day one that this is about maintaining free and
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:14.000]  fair elections in this country. It is not about overturning an outcome. It is about making sure
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.840]  that election integrity is preserved and every American should want that. If every American
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:25.520]  is not on board with that, you have to ask yourself why. If your fake news network is not
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:31.280]  covering this or allowing you to cover it fairly and accurately, you should ask yourself why.
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:39.440]  This is absolutely a legitimate legal basis. We have been asked to provide an entire case
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:45.200]  that generally would take years in civil litigation. I have been a prosecutor. I have tried cases
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:51.040]  with far simpler facts. One thing happened in a matter of minutes and it still takes days
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:57.840]  and we go through a jury process. This is the court of public opinion right now. We are not
[1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:02.800]  trying our case in the court of public opinion because if we were, we would get unbiased jurors.
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:09.040]  I would strike 99% of you from the jury and I would be allowed to because of the fake news
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:16.320]  coverage you provide. You are not unbiased jurors. Until you step out of your role as a journalist
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:23.280]  and actually go into a courtroom and you are a judge on a bench that has sworn an oath to be
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:29.600]  unbiased in our separation of powers, then your opinion does not matter. The facts matter.
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:35.760]  The truth matters. If you are fair reporters, you will cover that fairly and appropriately and
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:41.600]  you will allow coverage of our media. This is Jenna Ellis, one of Trump's great legal team members.
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:46.400]  I mean, what an absolute champion. This is incredible, folks. We are skipping these breaks.
[1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:51.840]  This is historic. Wow. What a moment here. American patriots are rising and fighting back.
[1:04:51.840 --> 1:04:55.040]  This is only the beginning. We have only begun to fight. Let's go back to this historic press
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:03.120]  conference. Then that is absolutely unacceptable for journalistic standards. This is an opening
[1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:08.720]  statement. This is something where we have told you what the evidence will show and we have given
[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:14.640]  you a brief description. That happens in a courtroom all the time where that's not the fact
[1:05:14.640 --> 1:05:19.920]  finding process. That is just an overview. That is what we have given you today because the American
[1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:25.520]  people deserve to know what we have uncovered in the last couple of weeks. Remember, this is such a
[1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:32.240]  short time frame and this is an elite strike force team that is working on behalf of the president
[1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:38.960]  and the campaign to make sure that our Constitution is protected. We are a nation of rules, not a
[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:44.800]  nation of rulers. There is not someone that just gets to pick who the next president is outside
[1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:50.560]  the will of the American people. That is our task because when we talk about voter fraud,
[1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:58.080]  it's actually election official fraud. That cannot stand. The Constitution requires that the state
[1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:03.520]  legislatures are the ones that make a election. Once again, this is in for war's live coverage
[1:06:03.520 --> 1:06:08.400]  of the historic stop the steel press conference is what we'll call it. Rudy Giuliani,
[1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:13.040]  Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis speaking now. Joseph DeGeneva looks like is in the background. Maybe
[1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:18.320]  he'll speak too. Jenna Ellis is just laying it all out right now. No holds barred. Let's go back
[1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:24.720]  to this live coverage. Our American system. Our founders were so brilliant that they anticipated
[1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:29.040]  this, that there would be corruption. There would be foreign influence. There would be attempts to
[1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:34.320]  manipulate the outcome of the election, especially with who they called our chief magistrate. I
[1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:40.080]  would encourage all of you to go home and actually read Alexander Hamilton's Federalist 68 and see
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:49.520]  what he described as an advocacy position to adopt and ratify the electoral college and the
[1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:55.040]  process by which we select our president. We select our president through the electoral college,
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:07:00.960]  not because it disenfranchises voters, but because it is a security mechanism for exactly the type
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:06.400]  of corruption that we are uncovering. And every American should be grateful and thankful that
[1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:11.760]  our founders had the foresight to put in those protections and provisions to make sure that
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:19.200]  your legitimate legal vote is not disenfranchised. That is what we are advocating for. We want to
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:25.040]  make sure to protect election integrity and your president, President Trump, we are so proud that
[1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:31.760]  he is in this fight because he understands that when he swore his oath of office, he swore an oath
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:38.160]  to uphold and defend the United States Constitution. That is what he is doing. And that is what we
[1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:43.440]  are doing. We are confident that through this multiple pathway to victory, we will get to the
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:50.320]  actual outcome that the evidence shows. But this is not about overturning an election on our part.
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:54.720]  It is about making sure that we protect and preserve free and fair elections
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:01.360]  for all future American elections. If the United States caves to corruption or this type of election
[1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:12.400]  integrity disaster, then no election will be secure from here on out. And we all need to be
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:19.680]  keenly aware of that. We are the representatives here that are standing in this gap and defending
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:26.080]  President Trump and defending you, the American people, at the end of the day. This is ultimately
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:30.640]  about the United States of America. And we want to make sure to protect and defend that. And as
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:35.200]  my colleagues have said, we will not back down. We won't be intimidated. President Trump will not
[1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:39.920]  be intimidated. You, the American people, should not be intimidated. You, the press, should cover
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:46.480]  this fairly and should know that this matters to election integrity and it matters to the future
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:52.320]  of our nation. So we have given you an overview, but recognize this is not a court of law. We will
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:58.640]  get there and we have time and we have constitutional provisions that will step in when we show the
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:07.520]  corruption and the irredeemably challenged and overturned votes that are absolutely corrupt
[1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:12.880]  in all of these counties. It is irredeemably compromised. We will show that, but you have to
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:17.840]  give us that opportunity. This has been just our opening statement and we have an opportunity to
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:22.960]  get there and we have time and we will do that. This is the United States of America and we stand
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:31.440]  proudly for President Donald J. Trump. Thank you. That was incredible. Let's go back to Sidney Powell.
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:37.760]  It's watching this. I have gotten multiple emails from people in other countries who watch the same
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:44.560]  pattern happen there. We have witnessed testimony that the same things were done in those countries
[1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:52.880]  as this was exported from Venezuela and by Maduro and by Mr. Chavez and by Cuba and of course we
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:58.640]  know China also has a substantial presence in Venezuela and substantial interest in making
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:06.160]  sure that President Trump does not continue in office. This is the consummate foreign interference
[1:10:06.160 --> 1:10:12.800]  in our election in the most criminal way you can possibly imagine. It must be shut down.
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:19.040]  We know for example that one of the Dominion's highest level employees or officers went to
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:25.200]  Detroit himself to man the Detroit Operations Center where he could watch the votes coming in
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:32.720]  real time and decide what file folder in the system to put those votes into. That's why you see
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:37.840]  massive spikes after hours when people were told that all the votes were in and all the votes were
[1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:43.280]  counted. Many Dominion employees have already reached out to us to tell us the truth. They are
[1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:48.560]  Americans who want to ensure election integrity like we do. I would encourage every Dominion,
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:53.840]  our smartmatic employee, who is fed up with the corruption in this country to come forward as
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:58.960]  soon as possible because these are serious federal offenses that I am confident the Department of
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:03.680]  Justice will be in pursuit of in very short order if they are not already.
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:14.640]  All right, a few questions. Yeah, Mayor Giuliani, this sort of reminds of 30 years ago they had
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:18.880]  federal judges doing consent decrees over elections. They had a federal judge overseeing
[1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:26.240]  the election. Well, you'd be asking that in Georgia where you have two Senate races that have
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:33.280]  the U.S. District Court judges and federal authorities monitoring elections. I can't say
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:45.840]  what's going to be done about it. I'm sorry, in what county? Yes. I know about it. I really
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:51.840]  can't give you an opinion on that. I think obviously every election official should learn
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:56.880]  something from this and be very, very careful with the next election. I know this is a lot
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:05.360]  of information that we've given you, probably because we're frustrated with what we keep reading
[1:12:05.360 --> 1:12:11.680]  and hearing in the censored press, which is that we have no evidence, we have no specifics,
[1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:17.760]  we have no backup of what we're saying, and you largely ignore the affidavits that are filed,
[1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:25.520]  whether you agree or disagree with an affidavit. It's evidence. You can't say, I mean,
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:32.320]  you're just lying to the American people when you say there's no evidence. Sydney was giving you
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:39.760]  information that come from affidavits from other people that are given under oath. I was explaining
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:46.880]  things to you from affidavits that come from other people, American citizens who swear under oath
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:53.040]  that they saw 100,000 ballots come in and that they were all for Joe Biden,
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:13:01.440]  and that I should point out now that Sydney has spoken that those happened just around the time
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:10.800]  that the Dominion or Smartmatic people call the hall to the election, and then you can also trace
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:19.520]  it with a very big spike in the vote count at exactly that time. Right up. So what we're telling
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:27.840]  you is supported by evidence, and we're going to have to present these because of the procedures
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:32.400]  that exist according to the different voting laws of the different states. For example,
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:40.400]  you asked us about Wisconsin. We have to first create a contest in Wisconsin before we can move
[1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:49.520]  to bringing a fulsome federal lawsuit. The contest from everything I can see is going to overturn
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:56.240]  the vote because it's going to show somewhere around 100,000 illegal ballots in two counties
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:03.680]  that Biden carried by 75, 80 percent. And you know how close Wisconsin is. And what I'm talking
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:10.240]  about is the absentee ballots for which there were no applications. And that's not just a small
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:16.640]  matter. The reason for the application and the reason to keep all these things together is precisely
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:25.440]  to avoid what the Democrats did in this election, which is to misuse the absentee ballot process
[1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:30.960]  and the mail-in ballot process in order to cheat. So they really cheated in two respects.
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:42.400]  They cheated with the machines. Instead of asking me, are we going to bring a lawsuit in Wisconsin,
[1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:48.080]  which we will if we have to, you should have asked me and you should be more astounded by the fact
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:57.360]  that our votes are counted in Germany and in Spain by a company owned by affiliates
[1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:03.200]  of Chavez and Maduro. Did you ever believe that was true? Did any of you here believe
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:07.440]  that that was possible? Of course it's not. Of course it shouldn't be possible.
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:15.280]  I don't know if we're going to have time to develop all that in time to fill the requirements
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:20.480]  of all these cases. We have enough evidence without that to overturn this election. We have it from
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:25.200]  the affidavits of American citizens, but that's a matter of national security that we're talking
[1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:31.600]  about now. Very, very serious matter of national security. Please don't make light of it. And
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:36.640]  don't act like you knew it. Don't act like it isn't a surprise right now to cover the historic press
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:41.040]  conference. But in case anybody in that room is listening, please for the love of God, give Rudy
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:47.760]  Giuliani a towel to wipe his shoe polish sweat sideburns off the side of his face. I'm begging you
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:56.000]  guys, please. Let's go back to Rudy Giuliani. That the company counting our vote with control
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:04.560]  over our vote is owned by two Venezuelans who were allies of Chavez, are present allies of
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:13.280]  Maduro with a company whose chairman is a close associate and business partner of George Soros,
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:19.360]  the biggest donor to the Democrat Party, the biggest donor to Antifa, and the biggest donor
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:27.600]  to Black Lives Matter. My goodness, what do we have to do to get you to give our people the truth?
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:33.840]  Yes. Thank you, Giuliani, as well as with RSVN. Do you feel that heat?
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:39.840]  You have mentioned before that people close to the Trump campaign are pressuring them to drop
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:44.640]  the investigation into dominion. Can you go further into detail and just tell us specifically who
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:50.000]  those people are? Also, if it's possible, can you tell us if they work with some of our powerful
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:57.520]  defense groups in the United States, such as the CIA? The last part was, do they work with defense
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:17:05.440]  groups and the CIA? First, I'm in charge of this investigation with Sydney and the people you see
[1:17:05.440 --> 1:17:15.760]  here. There's been no pressure to stop investigating dominion. In fact, there's no pressure to go as
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:21.840]  fast as we can. I mean, I think there was uniform shock when we first heard it. I think when I first
[1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:27.040]  heard it, I didn't believe it until Sydney showed me the documents. And in fact, I feel kind of
[1:17:27.040 --> 1:17:32.000]  stupid in your wall should because all you had to do is go online and find out that Smartmatic
[1:17:32.800 --> 1:17:39.200]  is owned by Venezuelans close to Chavez. You can Google it. Well, unless they take it down,
[1:17:39.200 --> 1:17:46.560]  I preserved it. So you can find it. And by the way, the Kuhmer character who is close to Antifa.
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:50.880]  We're covering this live. We're skipping breaks. This is so historic. I'm getting a lot of people
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:54.960]  reaching out to me. In fact, let me just say that when we come back live because this is important.
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:59.040]  So let's go back to this live. We're skipping a break right now. But when we come back and
[1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:03.200]  satellite feeds pick us back up on the terrestrial radio and other things, I'm going to make a
[1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:06.400]  statement here. But let's go back and I'm going to make a statement in two seconds here.
[1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:10.880]  That they're going to fix this election. I don't know what you need to wake you up
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:19.200]  to do your job and inform the American people, whether you like it or not of the things they
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:26.080]  need to know. This is real. It is not made up. It is not. There's nobody here that engages in
[1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:31.840]  fantasies. I've tried 100 cases. I prosecuted some of the most dangerous criminals in the world.
[1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:37.600]  I know crimes. I can smell them. You don't have to smell this one. I can prove it to you 18 different
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:45.680]  ways. I can prove to you that he won Pennsylvania by 300,000 votes. I can prove to you that he won
[1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:54.000]  Michigan by probably 50,000 votes. When I went to bed on election night, he was ahead in all those
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:59.600]  states, every single one of those states. How is it they all turned around? Every single one of
[1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:03.520]  them turned around? Or is it more consistent that there was a plan to turn them around?
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.520]  And since there are witnesses who say there was a plan to turn them around,
[1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:14.320]  and it's kind of begs credulity to say that it all happened in every single state,
[1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:17.760]  my goodness, this is how you win cases in a courtroom.
[1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:28.560]  Yes, he wiped it. Thank God, Giuliani wiped it.
[1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:34.800]  What are the headlines going to say about Giuliani's shoe polish on the burn sweat?
[1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:42.000]  Our goal here is to go around the iron curtain of censorship. What publication are you with?
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:52.800]  Yeah, then. It's to go around the outrageous iron curtain of censorship and get facts to the
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:57.680]  American people. This is beautiful. We just had a public laughing stock at CNN here. You've
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:04.320]  been reporting for the last two weeks. These are facts. These are things that actually happen.
[1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:08.800]  These people really wrote these after David's. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back from
[1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:14.240]  what is a skipped break as we're covering this historic landmark press conference here. But
[1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:19.680]  I'm having a lot of people sending me messages, giving me feedback so far from today. I hosted
[1:20:19.680 --> 1:20:25.040]  the Alex Jones show yesterday with Alex. I hosted the War Room. I guess you could say I was kind of
[1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:30.480]  on edge. We'll just leave it at that. And people are sending me messages today saying, oh, and you
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:34.640]  sound a lot better today. You sound more confident. You sound a little more cool and collected and
[1:20:34.640 --> 1:20:40.240]  calm. What's going on? Folks, you have no idea what a big relief this is for me. Okay.
[1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:49.200]  I just went around the country last week and laid all this information out, literally to a T.
[1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:54.480]  It's almost like they studied my rallies, my Stop the Steel Caravan rallies, took notes,
[1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:57.520]  and then just went and investigated. And now we're showing all the evidence and getting
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:05.520]  ready to present it in a legal case. So yeah, I'm feeling pretty damn good because it makes me
[1:21:05.520 --> 1:21:12.160]  irrelevant. The fact that we have patriots, the fact that we have lawyers and state representatives
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:17.680]  and legislators and people in the media. And finally, we're coming back. People are fighting.
[1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:21.440]  They're ready to fight this corruption. They're ready to call it out. They're not cowering.
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:27.200]  They're not living in fear. We're publicly laughing at CNN journalists at this press conference.
[1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:33.360]  Thank God. So yeah, I'm feeling pretty damn good. I'm feeling pretty damn good right now
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:42.160]  when this historic landmark press conference to save our republic, to save our rigged elections,
[1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:48.400]  stop the banana republic, stop communist corruption. The fact that this sounds like exactly like
[1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:55.360]  what Infowars has been saying for months now. Yeah, feels pretty damn good. Not gonna lie.
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:58.880]  Let's go back live now as they're taking questions. Sidney Powell at the mic.
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:06.960]  Republican or Democratic candidates in any state across the country paid to have the system rigged
[1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:13.040]  to work for them. These people didn't do this just to take control. They make one heck of a lot of
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:19.280]  money off of it. Think about the global interests behind your own news organizations. Think about
[1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:26.240]  the pressure being brought to bear on from the social media companies to shut down free speech
[1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:33.440]  on any challenge to the election. This is a massive, well funded coordinated effort to deprive
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:39.040]  we the people of the United States of our most fundamental right under the Constitution to
[1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:48.160]  preserve this republic that we all cherish. It is of the greatest concern. It is the it is the 1775
[1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:57.440]  of of our generation and beyond. Yes, I know it's being held in Congress tabulated overseas.
[1:22:57.440 --> 1:23:02.240]  There's reports that there was a piece of hardware, possibly a server picked up in Germany.
[1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:08.400]  Is that true? And is it related to this? That is true. It is somehow related to this,
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:12.480]  but I do not know whether good guys got it or bad guys got it. We don't know who picked that.
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:22.640]  I can only hear one person at the time. I'm going to take the one with the hands raised.
[1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:24.160]  Yes.
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:33.200]  First on the issue of the machine, do you plan to have are you seeking a court order to either
[1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:38.560]  speed or container just to gain access to any of these machines in any of these contested districts?
[1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:43.840]  Have you begun that process and when to expect a timeline on that? And then for you, Mr. Mayor,
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:50.400]  you mentioned in Wisconsin and in Michigan, these issues of over-moting. Where can we learn more
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:56.880]  about that? You're saying 150, 200 percent? Up to 350 percent in some places. Where where would
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:02.960]  we get access to that data? And then to what extent were those people who showed up to vote
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:09.760]  in person because in Michigan, for example, they did allow same-day registration? Yes. Well,
[1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:15.920]  the same-day registration causes problems with the vote signature and the registration itself.
[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:21.680]  That's a whole different system that makes it impossible really to validate the signature.
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:27.840]  I mean, one person could sign the same name. I mean, I could sign John Smith. I could sign
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:34.880]  Kay Smith. I could sign on both things and run 50 ballots that way. And we've got some evidence of
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:39.120]  that being done as well. Rudy, do you want to speak to the other part of it? Sure.
[1:24:42.720 --> 1:24:50.720]  We have now three overvote analysis is done. One for Pennsylvania, one for Michigan,
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:55.440]  and one for Wisconsin. We're in the process, oh, I'm sorry, Georgia,
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:03.600]  when the process of doing the others. I'll check to see if it's appropriate for us to make it public.
[1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:08.720]  Well, I imagine it is, but you could actually do it. Yeah. You could do it yourself.
[1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:14.000]  A lot of the analysis comes from the real-time data that came through to the news medias,
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:20.960]  the night and following the election. And some entrepreneurs out there have started crunching
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:26.000]  data. That's the wild thing. That's what I'm saying. This information is publicly available.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  You can't go into the archives and basically see how they're obtaining it. That's what they're
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:35.440]  saying they're in the process of doing. But you can see how they have 350% vote turnout.
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:40.640]  You can see how there's 200,000 votes magically for Biden at 3 a.m. in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:46.080]  Again, I just did a whole tour on the southeast coast explaining all this. So yeah, I'm feeling
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:54.080]  kind of good that these freedom-loving monsters of law are taking on the deep state,
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:57.520]  taking on the globalists, trying to save our country. Yeah, this is very relieving.
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:04.880]  And the vote tallies in the middle of the night after they supposedly stopped counting.
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:11.120]  And that's when the Dominion operators went in and injected votes and changed the whole system.
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:18.000]  And it affects votes around the country, around the world, and all kinds of massive
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:26.080]  interests of globalist dictators, corporations. You name it. Everybody's against us except
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:31.680]  President Trump and we the people of the United States. You spoke of unleashing the
[1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:36.080]  cracking. Is the country ready for this? I mean, Americans should be astonished
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:39.760]  what you're saying here today. Is the country on the verge of an electoral breakdown?
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:45.600]  We've already had it. We have already had that electoral breakdown. But the Constitution,
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:51.360]  as Jenna explains, has provisions in it for how you fix this. And there should never be
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:56.000]  another election conducted in this country. I don't care if it's for local dog catcher
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:03.120]  using a Dominion machine and smartmatic software. We have got to have an American company that uses
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:09.600]  paper ballots that we can all verify so every one of us can see that our vote is our vote.
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:13.760]  Why are you not requesting recounts in Wisconsin counties that use Dominion software?
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:18.240]  You're requesting recounts in two counties that don't use the software all the time.
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:22.240]  This case is not only about, remember, this case didn't begin with Dominion.
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:28.080]  This case began and this case can be proven the old fashioned way. It can be proven based on just
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:35.440]  good old fashioned Democratic tactics to go back to Mayor Daly in the 1960s when he held the vote
[1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:42.720]  back in Chicago so that he could elect John F. Kennedy or as recently as last year when they
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:48.080]  held the vote back in Palm Beach County and Broward County in order to see if they could steal
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:52.720]  that election for the Senate and Governor and then got caught manufacturing ballots.
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:28:00.480]  Democrats have been doing this for years on a small scale. When they passed a mail-in voter
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:08.000]  statute which all of a sudden multiplied by 10 times the number of mail-in votes,
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:12.800]  they realized they could have a field day. They could do precisely what Jimmy Carter
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:20.800]  and Secretary Baker warned us about. All you have to do is own an election board
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:25.040]  and you can get away with it and unlike what Sydney is talking about where you can have a paper
[1:28:25.040 --> 1:28:31.200]  trail, a paper ballot, I tried to point out to you the minute that you separate the outer envelope
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:36.640]  from the ballot you can no longer trace it which is why the count whatever the count in Georgia
[1:28:36.640 --> 1:28:41.520]  today is it's totally ridiculous. They're counting the same fraudulent ballot. All right ladies and
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:48.400]  gentlemen our network feed, the infowars network feed is skipping breaks. Local radio or satellite
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:52.720]  stations may still be going to those breaks so we may be breaking. We'll be right back but for
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:56.160]  the infowars network feeds we're skipping breaks and sticking with this historic press conference.
[1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:09.760]  It is about something. Let's go from the big picture to the smaller picture. The most important
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:16.640]  thing here is that this has been a massive attack on the integrity of the voting system in the greatest
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:23.120]  democracy on earth. The people who did this have committed one of the worst crimes that I've ever
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  that I've ever seen or observed. One of the things we're the most proud of in this country
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:34.080]  is that we've been such a long-standing democracy based on the right to vote. They have
[1:29:34.880 --> 1:29:39.360]  trashed the right to vote. They've dishonored the right to vote. They've destroyed the right to vote
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:46.320]  and they agreed for power and money and there's no doubt about it. This was not an individual idea
[1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:52.720]  of 10 or 12 Democrat bosses. This is a plan. You would have to be a fool not to realize that.
[1:29:53.360 --> 1:30:00.320]  They do the same thing in exactly the same way in 10 big Democrat controlled in most cases
[1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:06.240]  crooked city and when I say crooked city go look at how many of their officials have gone to jail
[1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:13.360]  in the last 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 years that they have dominated and destroyed those cities.
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:18.800]  They picked the places where they could get away with it. They picked the places where whether or
[1:30:18.800 --> 1:30:24.640]  not Republicans testified to something. Judges would just dismiss it because judges are appointed
[1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:31.040]  politically and too many of them are hacks. They picked places where they could get a sheriff
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:40.240]  that refused to enforce a court order. When we got a court order that we could be 10 feet closer,
[1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:45.200]  10 feet closer, our representatives were told if you try to do it, I'll arrest you.
[1:30:53.200 --> 1:31:00.720]  Part one, it began as a national conspiracy. Clearly that evidence emerged very, very quickly.
[1:31:01.280 --> 1:31:04.880]  The minute I saw that it was the same thing in 10 states,
[1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:12.960]  just using logic, I said this can't be an accident and then what I was surprised about
[1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:20.240]  is the dimension of it. I mean, not inspecting almost 700,000 ballots is astounding.
[1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:29.600]  Honestly, I don't know what Joe Biden is aware of or not aware of and I mean that
[1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:35.760]  that as a lawyer, not trying to be, not trying to be cute. I've watched him. I've observed him.
[1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:42.960]  I honestly don't know how much he's aware. I don't know how much he decides
[1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:45.680]  and how much things are decided for him. So I...
[1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:50.960]  Let me address one other thing to your question about the process. Your question is fundamentally
[1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:55.680]  flawed when you're asking where is the evidence. You clearly don't understand the legal process.
[1:31:55.680 --> 1:32:02.720]  What we have asked for in the court is to not have the certification of false results.
[1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:09.600]  And so to say, hold on a minute, we have evidence that we will present to the court. We haven't had
[1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:14.720]  the opportunity yet to present that to the court. We're giving you an overview and a preview of
[1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:22.000]  what we've discovered, but no court yet has had, we've had that opportunity. So when we have a,
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:26.080]  we've had, and we have fraud allegations pending. So what we've asked for are temporary straining
[1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:31.760]  orders or injunctions to not certify false results. We're very happy that Michigan, why the reason
[1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:37.280]  we dismissed that lawsuit today, is because the Michigan county in Wayne County, they're not going
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:43.760]  to certify that because 71% of counties have inconsistent data. No person in this room or in
[1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:50.480]  this country should want states to rush through and coronate a president with false results.
[1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:54.160]  We have to make sure that the results are accurate. That's what we will prove.
[1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:54.800]  Two more questions.
[1:32:54.800 --> 1:32:58.000]  The Secretary of State says that, that, that can actually happen, that those votes
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:01.360]  can't be rescinded and as a certification in Michigan's county stands.
[1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:02.320]  Secretary of State, where?
[1:33:02.320 --> 1:33:03.440]  In Michigan.
[1:33:03.440 --> 1:33:07.360]  Yeah. Well, there are problems in Michigan. Follow the money.
[1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:12.720]  Follow the political party, man. I mean, you're actually serious. Rudy Giuliani,
[1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:16.800]  Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, and others, they say they're going to take two more questions.
[1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:21.760]  When Michigan, when the Secretary of State of Michigan never bothered to find out
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:28.880]  that the votes in her state were being counted, being counted in Germany by a Venezuelan company
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:35.040]  and you want me to take her seriously or him seriously? I mean, I was, I was in government.
[1:33:36.880 --> 1:33:40.720]  If I were the governor of that state, I'd fire everybody that was involved in this election.
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:46.480]  They didn't come and tell me that my state was going to be embarrassed, made a fool of
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:52.320]  because I'm sending my votes of people in Michigan over to Germany to be counted by a company
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:58.640]  that is owned by people who are allies of Maduro and Chavez. By the way,
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:03.440]  Carolyn Maloney, who wrote that is my congresswoman. Democrat pointed that out.
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:10.720]  They didn't do the darkest bit of, of due diligence. If you bought a 10 million dollar
[1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:15.920]  company, you would have done more due diligence due diligence or that maybe they're incompetent
[1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:20.240]  or maybe they didn't want to know. But you're not going to have me take seriously
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:24.880]  anything that comes from anyone involved in the election the way it was conducted in Michigan.
[1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:34.240]  The Secretary of State can say whatever she wants to say. Of course she's going to say that.
[1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:39.200]  She's a Democrat. She could also credit the affidavits of the two people
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.200]  and say that the board is tied and therefore the vote hasn't been certified.
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:49.280]  So because she's a Democrat, she's saying that. Do you think she has any credibility?
[1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:54.160]  Having run the kind of election they ran in Michigan? You think anyone in that government
[1:34:54.160 --> 1:35:00.480]  has credibility after using a machine and fooling their citizens? That can't be a person in Michigan
[1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:04.480]  who thought their vote was being sent outside the United States so somebody could play with it.
[1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:10.400]  I mean, it's by the way, the Gateway Pundit has now published the numbers they've been reporting.
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:15.840]  Folks, in all these counties, the vote comes back from overseas and it's the exact same ratio split,
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:20.240]  the exact same percentage split, a literal zero percent possibility.
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:28.400]  Are you going to be able to see what we are? We're not, we are limited in what we can do. We're not
[1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:34.000]  the FBI. We're not the government. We don't have that kind of subpoena power. We don't have the
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  power to just go subpoena anything we want. The government does. We would have to subpoena
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:48.080]  in line with a case. Our first case, we're asking for that authority in Pennsylvania and in Michigan.
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:52.720]  But you have to get that authority from the court. We're private citizens. We're not the government.
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:58.880]  If I were the government, like I used to be, they'd probably be a lot of people arrested by now.
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:09.200]  Because there's plenty of probable cause. Plenty of probable cause.
[1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:20.080]  We've seen that a lot of your law students and in fact the lawyers have been kind of
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:25.200]  dropping like flies. What do you say to those people who call this a refugee 2.0 just on the
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:30.880]  other side? Why didn't this and also why didn't this. What what what what a fake network do you
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:36.320]  come from? I don't have a fake network. In fact, I am completely independent. I've known about my
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:42.880]  head. Oh my goodness. Well, first of all, first of all, our cases haven't been dismissed. We only have.
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:49.280]  Look at the plaintiffs who are involved in this. It's not our case, ma'am. Don't lie to people.
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:56.400]  I'm saying what do you say ma'am ma'am ma'am. You are lying. You're lying. You're lying.
[1:36:57.760 --> 1:37:05.280]  Well, continue to lie. I'm not going to play over their head. Ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am.
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:10.480]  Okay. Let me answer the question. Let me answer the question. The answer to the question is
[1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:16.880]  we don't have a lot of lawsuits. We only have three. Our lawsuits have not been dropped all over
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:24.880]  the place. Okay. Well, you're a totally discourteous person. I'm going to finish my answer. So
[1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:30.560]  I'm going to finish my answer. The fact is we have very, very few lawsuits. The lawsuits
[1:37:30.560 --> 1:37:35.280]  you're talking about have been brought by private individuals and groups. Most of them were dismissed
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:40.480]  for lack of standing. Probably correctly because they were brought before the election took place.
[1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:45.600]  The election is now over. The only lawsuit we have withdrawn is the one where we got the
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:50.240]  relief that we wanted. And that's the one in Michigan. We also have another lawsuit in Michigan
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:54.320]  that will accomplish the other objectives of what we want to do in Michigan. So it's silly to have
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:38:00.400]  two competing lawsuits. The only lawyer that left a case left because he was threatened.
[1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:05.760]  His family was threatened. His children were threatened. And so was the other lawyer. Yeah,
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:10.160]  that's true. We have a little difficulty getting lawyers because our lawyers get threatened with
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:16.240]  being killed because of the ridiculous way in which you cover this and the ridiculous way in
[1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:21.760]  which you cover. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about everybody, but I get a pretty
[1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:26.480]  good sense from the way you handle yourself, how you cover it. All right, we're finished with you
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:36.640]  now. One last question. One last question from a one last question. One last question. One last
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:44.560]  question from a reasonable civil person. Yeah, you are not. Yes. No, she isn't. Well, we'll find out.
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:04.720]  We're not going to drag it out. I mean, this is ridiculous for you to say we're dragging it out.
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:12.240]  Well, Al Gore, Al Gore had a lot more time than we've had, and we've had two weeks to investigate.
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:17.360]  So that's also completely unfair to say we're dragging it out. Also, if we're going to present
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:22.320]  things in court, if we present it to you, judges are not going to be very happy with us. And finally,
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:28.240]  I have to tell you, our witnesses don't want to be exposed to the tender mercies of a vicious
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:34.560]  press. I have great difficulty getting those witnesses that I did reveal to allow me to do it.
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:38.960]  They don't trust you. They don't like you. They think you put their lives in jeopardy with the
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:43.200]  spin that you put on what's going on here and with the unfairness in which you cover it.
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:48.960]  It's not easy to reveal the things that they tell me. The answer is no. The answer is I can't do it
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:54.080]  because I can't. I can't put up witnesses life in jeopardy or a person who thinks there's life
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:59.040]  in jeopardy. This woman tells me we have lawyers dropping out of the case. We have lawyers dropping
[1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:04.000]  out of the case because they're being threatened with destruction of their careers, destruction of
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.080]  their livelihood, and in some cases, destruction of their lives. That comes about because of the
[1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:13.520]  hysterical way in which you have covered Donald Trump and his administration. But we're going to
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:18.000]  change all that. We're going to go to courts. We're going to prove it in court. I would love to
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:22.960]  release all the information that I have. I would love to give it to you all, except most of you
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:28.160]  wouldn't cover it. A few of you would. And then we'd have half the American people probably inform
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:35.840]  the censorship that is going on in this country right now by big tech and by big media is almost
[1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:40.880]  as dangerous as the election fraud that we're revealing. Maybe just as dangerous. We're headed
[1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:47.600]  to a very bad place and it is not inappropriate that a Venezuelan company counter our votes. Thank you.
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:41:02.080]  Wow. Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, that was incredible. That was historic. That is going to resonate
[1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:12.880]  worldwide. That was a meteor impact level on the American body politic and the world.
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:21.840]  And this is just the beginning. Here's what we're going to do. We've skipped all of our
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:30.400]  breaks. We need to pay the bills. When we come back, I'm going to go through all of the notes here
[1:41:30.400 --> 1:41:35.680]  that I took listening to that press conference and lay it all out and what it means and what's
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:41.920]  coming next. But we got to take the first break that we've taken today because we've just been
[1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:45.760]  covering this historic press conference with Trump's legal team and wow.
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:55.840]  I mean, I even need a minute to just kind of gather my feet here. But folks,
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:04.160]  that's just incredible. I can't even. Ladies, gentlemen, we have any unplugged today? We've
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:10.000]  been skipping breaks. We've now funded and launched this whole stop steel caravan that's
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.160]  been going on for two weeks now with with Jones rallying people in Atlanta are going to be out
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:18.000]  there again Saturday. I think I'm going to be rallying again Saturday here in Austin. In fact,
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:21.360]  I might as well just admit just come out and say it. We're going to be doing it again Saturday here
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:25.920]  at the State Capitol in Austin. They did it last Saturday. It was huge. We didn't even do it or
[1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:30.720]  promote it. I'll be out there Saturday. Come out and join me. State Capitol here in Austin at noon.

[1:42:51.680 --> 1:42:57.360]  air that press conference. We have to air it. You know, something very sad is happening. It's
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:01.520]  very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when info wars got banned off of more
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:07.680]  than 60 major platforms. I warned everybody there was a precedent for the upcoming presidential
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:13.520]  election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until
[1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:18.320]  effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives,
[1:43:18.320 --> 1:43:22.640]  nationals, and populists. And now that's happened. And then I told everybody that they would then
[1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:29.280]  start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate in protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown
[1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:34.080]  and that Trump knew to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 is basically an overblown
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:39.280]  hoax. He started to do that the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that
[1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:43.760]  that's the pincer attack they're going to use. They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:47.680]  war to stir up the American people and divide us. And they're going to use economic warfare
[1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:52.880]  shutting down the economy to try to control us. I hope people will listen now to my warnings
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:57.440]  because I'm on air telling people what's coming next. Remember Hillary Clinton. Remember Pelosi.
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:03.280]  Remember Bill Clinton. Remember Obama. All of them said we are not going to concede if there's
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:07.040]  a red mirage. We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win a landslide because they
[1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:13.120]  had the internal polls. And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:20.160]  margin and he was set to win the other ones. They froze the seven states on election night and then
[1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:24.000]  they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had. This is completely transparent. So when they
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.800]  say that he is president elect, he's not. Trump is not conceded. None of the states have certified
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:33.600]  the vote. And now all these investigations have been opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:39.280]  of election fraud has come out and already been documented. And in Georgia, officials are on
[1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:44.080]  record saying we've already found fraud. So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in. They've run bigger
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:49.200]  and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax failed. But now this is the mother of all hoaxes.
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:53.600]  And if they get away with this, it's the end of America. As we know it, we will be Venezuela
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:45:00.880]  in full wars.com. Big tech is in league with the globalist and the chai cops as attempting
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:07.680]  an information to against America. And when we take this country back, they must be held accountable.
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:16.160]  The games are over. The waiting is over. The fight is now out in the open. World government is here
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:20.800]  in the latter part of 2020 is attempting to collapse the world economy, set up the global
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:26.640]  digital currency and AI surveillance system and info wars is on the front lines, fighting harder

[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:36.320]  in response to that landmark historic press conference that we just witnessed. But folks,

[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:45.840]  wars store.com. We just skipped, I think five or six breaks. That's money that's not coming in.

[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:31.280]  shopping at info wars store.com today. We just skipped like six or seven breaks. That's money
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:37.200]  not coming in. So please we're relying on you to make up for that by going to info wars store.com
[1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:45.840]  today and doing some shopping. Now, I've got a ton of news here to cover. I got a ton of more news
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:57.360]  coming in, but let me go through my notes here. What we just heard saw and witnessed there at
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:04.480]  that press conference nearly went two hours. Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis doing the
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:09.120]  speaking. I mean, Jenna Ellis talk about a rising star.
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:16.480]  But I said this before and I'm going to say it again because
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:22.800]  kind of the easiest bellwether the most organic bellwether for me to just see if I'm engaging
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:28.160]  or what people are thinking about is just my incoming messages. And from yesterday to today
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:33.120]  with my coverage, people are saying, hey, you sound a little more relaxed today. You sound more
[1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:38.800]  confident. What's going on? That's good. You're not as upset as you were yesterday or whatever
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:43.280]  words they're using. I'm saying, yeah, well, I'm sitting here listening to this press conference
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:49.680]  and I've got Rudy Giuliani. I've got Sidney Powell. I've got Jenna Ellis on Trump's legal team
[1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:54.480]  having this press conference that's being watched worldwide. Right side broadcasting is streaming
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:59.760]  it as well. We had millions of people tuning into it live. I'm sure right side broadcasting has had
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:04.080]  hundreds of thousands like they normally do. So people are getting this information and it sounds
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:11.600]  exactly like info wars. It sounds like they just took bullet points from my stop to steal caravan
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:16.320]  rallies, wrote them down, went and did the actual legal investigation to find the proof,
[1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:22.400]  get the affidavits and now they have it all. So yeah, there's a bit of a relief factor there folks
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:27.520]  when you're in the arena fighting feeling like you're alone in the arena and then all of a sudden
[1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:31.920]  the troops come in and you get a little, you know, chance to catch your wind in the middle of the
[1:50:32.560 --> 1:50:38.000]  ring. Yeah, that's a pretty relieving factor there. So that's incredible.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:49.040]  That's incredible. Jenna Ellis used a phrase multiple times that I think is key. The election
[1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:58.240]  results, the process of our election is irredeemable. Irredeemable. It's fake folks. We haven't had
[1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:05.600]  elections in this country for a long time. We've had selections and just by sheer will and voter
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:13.760]  turnout alone, we've been able to keep some actual patriotic people in government. We were actually
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:18.800]  able to get Donald Trump in there. That's with all their theft, with all their stealing, with the
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:24.640]  rigged voting machines. But see, they knew they had to go 10 times as much as they had in 2016
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:28.000]  to rig this election against Trump. So they did it and they got caught. It was so obvious.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:37.760]  But irredeemable. The way we have been electing our officials and the process and the technology
[1:51:37.760 --> 1:51:44.400]  we've been using is irredeemable. It must be ended forever if we're going to save this republic
[1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:50.160]  and we're going to save our elections. Irredeemable. Very choice word by Jenna Ellis.
[1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:56.400]  Sidney Powell. Again, it's like they were taking notes from the stop to steal caravan rallies.
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:01.600]  I'm not even saying that's the case. We're just speaking the truth. So it's like, wow,
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:07.920]  someone else with a bigger platform, with a lot more power and pull, is speaking the truth and
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:13.440]  seeking the truth and telling the American people, thank God, it's like a glass of ice water in the
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:23.040]  desert. So Sidney Powell says, the world is watching. And she's right. The world is watching.
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:27.440]  And the world is waiting to see if America can defeat this tyranny and then they will get the
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:33.520]  clarion call and they will fight as well. And we will expose the rigged voting machines so that
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:40.320]  other countries can have fair elections again as well too. Sidney Powell said, we should never
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:48.800]  have another election with Dominion or Smartmatic voting machines. Bingo. Bingo. They're irredeemable.
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:56.480]  They rig elections. Every American should be up in arms about this.
[1:52:56.480 --> 1:53:03.200]  Rudy Giuliani said our elections were hacked. They were hacked. They were hacked. These are
[1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:09.040]  electronic voting machines. They get hacked remotely. And this is why this is going to be such a tough
[1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:14.480]  legal fight because folks, they can't do recounts. They don't even have ballots to recount it. Rudy
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:19.040]  Giuliani even showed you. They throw out the ballots. They input into a machine. And then all
[1:53:19.040 --> 1:53:24.560]  you have is that machine data that can be rigged remotely, changed remotely, deleted remotely,
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:29.440]  inputted remotely. So it's all about exposing these rigged voting machines, folks. That is the
[1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:33.920]  number one key. And for all the people in the media that cried Russian collusion for four years,
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:42.640]  you disingenuous dirtbag liberals better be just as upset with the foreign interference
[1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:49.840]  in 2020 from China, from Germany, from Spain, from Venezuela. Now, they probably won't be,
[1:53:50.880 --> 1:53:58.240]  but again, that shows you their giant fraud. Rudy Giuliani described this election theft
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:08.320]  as one of the biggest crimes in history. Citi Pal echoed that behind him saying in world history.
[1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:13.520]  Giuliani said if he was still in government, people would be arrested. I'd like to nominate Rudy
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:21.440]  Giuliani to head of the Department of Justice. Rudy Giuliani said that his legal team and people
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:25.520]  involved in this, including the people signing affidavits that end up going public, are receiving
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:31.600]  death threats. Yes, folks, we are dealing with a criminal cabal, a worldwide gangster mafia
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:39.920]  at which Joe Biden sits at the head table. I believe they want this to go to the Supreme
[1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:46.160]  Court. Rudy Giuliani has said, hinted at that, as has Citi Pal. And I think that's because their
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:50.960]  goal here, folks, is to expose these rigged elections and then cement that we will never
[1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:55.920]  have anything like this again in our country with a Supreme Court decision. It's a big risk,
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:01.680]  but it's going for the home run. It's going for broke. And if that's their mentality, then I understand
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:07.040]  it and I'm behind it. And I just hope that there are people of the nine Supreme Court judges that
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:11.760]  have enough integrity and wherewithal to realize how important this is. They shouldn't be politicized,
[1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:20.240]  but we know they are to put their politics aside and realize this is all about our election system
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:26.560]  and fair elections worldwide and exposing corruption. And I do think it will ultimately end
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:30.400]  up there and that will ultimately end up being the case and it may take a few months for us to get
[1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:36.560]  to that point. So it's going to be long and drawn out. Now, I expect, and the crew is already telling
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:44.240]  me that Fox News is already spinning this, but CNN and MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, Washington Post,
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:50.240]  New York Times, get ready. They're all going to say no evidence, no evidence, no evidence, no evidence.
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:55.760]  Big tech is going to censor that press conference, censor any clips, censor anything and say no evidence,
[1:55:55.760 --> 1:56:00.480]  no evidence, no evidence. That's their big move is no evidence, no evidence, no evidence, even though we
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:06.880]  have all the evidence. It's the biggest gaslight in history. It's the biggest lie in history. And
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:11.920]  you say, well, what about all the other lies? Every big lie they tell is stacked on top of that lie
[1:56:11.920 --> 1:56:18.400]  and therefore bigger than that lie. There's so much evidence you're swimming in it. And they'll say no
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:27.920]  evidence. So get ready for that narrative. And so they called out Michigan hard, the governor, the
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:35.920]  secretary of state. They should be arrested for what they've done. But ladies and gentlemen, what is
[1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:43.920]  this crushing defeat of the left and the Democrats and the moron liberals going to look like in two
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:52.960]  months? This is going to be worse than 2016 now 100 times. It's going to be worse when they had no
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:59.920]  Russian collusion and no evidence and no witnesses. It's going to be worse than their two-time failed
[1:56:59.920 --> 1:57:03.920]  impeachment. It's going to be worse than us getting Kavanaugh in, Coney Barrett in. It's going to be
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:09.920]  all of it combined times 10 folks. They are really celebrating this cheat over us because it feels even
[1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:17.920]  better that they cheated and got away with it because that's even more empowering. So and there's
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:21.920]  going to be rallies all across the nation this Saturday at every state Capitol. In fact, I announced
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:25.920]  it last segment. We don't even have to really the crew to properly do this. I don't give a damn
[1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:31.920]  organic grassroots. Come out to the Austin State Capitol building on Saturday at noon. Okay. Come
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:37.920]  out. Wave your flag. Let's just dominate this culturally. Let's dominate this in the streets.
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:43.920]  Let's dominate this in the courtroom. We all must be activated now. The future of the Republic depends on it.
[1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:51.920]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist
[1:57:51.920 --> 1:57:57.920]  Chinese and the United Nations. And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient,
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:03.520]  models of complete lockdowns, you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:09.040]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women,
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:13.920]  and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator has put them under her control.
[1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:19.360]  That's right. She's been rigging elections for years and years. And the same thing is coming here to
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:23.920]  the United States. This is world government in Philadelphia. They've announced four people or
[1:58:23.920 --> 1:58:28.720]  more seen together will be arrested. They're announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is
[1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:34.080]  what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you, to take red of all your due process and
[1:58:34.080 --> 1:58:40.400]  absolutely transform the world into a prison planet. How long have we warned you about this?
[1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:44.560]  But you can fight back. America is the last bastion. Stop submitting.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:51.920]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different
[1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:56.160]  mixes of the two. One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[1:58:56.160 --> 1:59:01.360]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture
[1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:07.920]  and ingenuity, art and skill and strength. The other is based on the massive number of slaves
[1:59:07.920 --> 1:59:15.200]  it controls with a tiny elite above it. America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos
[1:59:15.200 --> 1:59:20.720]  of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high tech slavery. That's why the globalists
[1:59:20.720 --> 1:59:25.120]  tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't. They point out one of our evils,
[1:59:25.120 --> 1:59:29.600]  so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters. A global permanent lockdown
[1:59:29.600 --> 1:59:33.920]  is here. It is already causing millions and millions of starved to death. When they're done,
[1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:38.080]  billions will starve to death. Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England,
[1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:41.920]  Antitope General, have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger
[1:59:41.920 --> 1:59:46.240]  a giant new world war. That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:22.720]  These developments are so historic. They're so impactful. And we're right here at the core of it all.
[2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:34.400]  And America in the next two months, Americans in the next two months
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:42.160]  have a decision to make. It's very simple. The issues are complex. The data is complex. The
[2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:46.240]  analysis is complex. The history is complex. But the decision is simple.
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:52.560]  Either the United States of America, the Republic,
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:59.760]  the will for independence and self government lives on as a worldwide example for human freedom
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:06.960]  and liberty in a free market capitalist system in a democratic republic. And we go on as free Americans
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:17.200]  and we continue our manifest destiny of prosperity and private ownership of land and business
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:22.800]  and in a free market with no government interference. And we continue that prosperity
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:30.880]  into the future as a worldwide example or it's done. It's over. Your freedoms are gone. Your
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:38.640]  self government is gone. Your will will be arrested. You will no longer have elections. You
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:43.120]  will no longer have private property. You will no longer have a free market. You will no longer
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:48.080]  have a business. You'll have nothing. You'll have whatever the government gives you. And that's it.
[2:01:50.080 --> 2:01:55.440]  And that's it. That's your choice. Freedom or tyranny? Freedom or tyranny?
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:02:02.320]  It's all in the balance in the next two months, all of it.
[2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:09.040]  And I'm still so perplexed and stunned
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:18.640]  at the modern day left as we view it, whether it's Antifa or BLM or all of these other suckers
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:27.440]  that fall for fake news and hate Trump. It's not even about Trump. And I've always held out
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:32.720]  this weird hope, even if it's a tiny little fraction of a percentage like the chances you'll
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:44.000]  die of COVID like 0.001%. Maybe these people will finally get it, how they've been screwed over,
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:47.920]  how they've been fooled, how they've been duped, and they'll stop being mad at the people that
[2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:52.080]  are trying to expose it and instead turn and be mad at the people that duped them, fooled them,
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:56.320]  and then wanted to enslave them. I still have a small smattering of hope that's possible, but
[2:02:58.240 --> 2:03:03.600]  they're full in, man. They're full in. They love the Biden steal. They love the Biden child molest.
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:08.480]  They love the Biden collusion with foreign countries. They love it all. They love the mainstream
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.920]  media. They love the mask. They love their servitude. They love their slavery because at a
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:18.560]  psychological level, you have to understand there's a will in people. There's a will to be free
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:26.560]  or a will not to be free. So when you have a will to be free, you have a spirit of liberty.
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:32.960]  You have a spirit of freedom. When you have the will to control, you're willing to sacrifice anything
[2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:42.400]  in order to achieve that control over your fellow man. So for the low level street liberal Democrat,
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:48.000]  the mask is enough for them. If they can just tell you to wear a mask, they feel fulfilled,
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  and that's good for them. They don't want to own any property. They don't want to run a small
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:55.200]  business. They don't want to have a family. They don't want to learn for themselves. They don't
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:59.040]  want to think for themselves. They just want to control you and tell you what to do. So if it's
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:03.680]  as simple as a tiny little thing, like making you wear a mask, that's all they need for the rest of
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:10.880]  their life. And that's all they'll have. We, on the other hand, the freedom loving individuals,
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:16.000]  we want a free market. We want private property. We want a family. We want a church. We want a
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:22.880]  business. We want prosperity. And these are the two diametrically opposed forces right now,
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:30.320]  and it's all hanging in the balance in the next two months. And I thank God. I thank God people
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:34.960]  are finally willing to stand up against this monster, this deep state, this globalism, this
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:44.240]  global criminal cabal, this global criminal mafia. I'm so glad Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell,
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:48.480]  Jenna Ellis, the others, more will rise up too. That's the beauty of it. When you see something
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:56.560]  like this, that means that means the backup forces are coming. The great moment of truth this year,
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:02.080]  America discovered the last five, six years that you were under globalist control,
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:06.960]  and the traitors of both parties have sold us out to communist China and multinational corporations,
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:11.360]  and we're establishing an authoritarian anti-American system. Well, now they've launched their
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:16.560]  counter assault and through fraud are trying to steal the election right now and complete the
[2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:22.160]  police state takeover by bankrupting the people of the United States, but also the entire world
[2:05:22.160 --> 2:05:27.520]  to bring us to our knees under the great reset. Info wars has never been more valuable or more
[2:05:27.520 --> 2:05:31.360]  important, and I'm honored for the position that you've put me in and for God's blessing.
[2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:36.240]  But I'm asking all listeners to understand that info wars is spending more money. We've ever
[2:05:36.240 --> 2:05:42.400]  spent in the fight to expose the stolen election agenda 21, the great reset, and the globalist
[2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:47.280]  takeover. So please visit infowarstore.com today. We have the big stop to steal sale that I've
[2:05:47.280 --> 2:05:50.800]  extended through the weekend, but then it will end because so many products are about to sell out.
[2:05:50.800 --> 2:06:06.720]  Pre ship and triple pay to get points at 60% off infowarstore.com
[2:06:06.720 --> 2:06:29.920]  Come and take it. And they're trying. They're trying to take it all, but America is rising up,
[2:06:29.920 --> 2:06:39.040]  ladies and gentlemen, the disingenuous hypocrisy, fraudulent, phony nature of the liberal left has
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:44.480]  been fully exposed and America is done with it. neutral Americans are being kicked into high
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:50.800]  gear. The fear that people had to stand up against this deep state, this global criminal cabal is
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:07:00.480]  starting to wane as they realize the entire future is in the balance. And so I predict from the
[2:07:00.480 --> 2:07:06.640]  leadership of Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Linwood and others, more Americans are going
[2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:13.040]  to join this fight and we are going to be roaring in the next two months, roaring our way to victory,
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:17.360]  roaring our way, exposing the deep state election fraud that we've been dealing with in this country
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:25.120]  for decades. And then roaring our way to a free market prosperity into the 2020s,
[2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:31.120]  unlike anything we've ever seen. Since maybe the 50s, maybe the original roaring 20s, but probably
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:41.680]  beyond that. But only can we manifest that destiny if we fight now. And so that's why I've decided,
[2:07:41.680 --> 2:07:47.120]  I mean, I haven't even organized this with anybody because I was thinking what's happening in Atlanta
[2:07:47.120 --> 2:07:52.160]  is so historic. You know, maybe I just try to fly out there. I have in studio duties tomorrow,
[2:07:52.160 --> 2:07:58.160]  so it'd be quite a relenting travel feat. But then I decided, you know what, the people are already
[2:07:58.160 --> 2:08:02.000]  in Atlanta, it's already going to be massive. Why don't I mobilize and activate here in Austin
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.720]  again, where for the last two weekends, there have been thousands of people turned up. So
[2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:10.640]  I'm going to be back out at the state Capitol this Saturday at noon.
[2:08:10.640 --> 2:08:17.600]  And if you want to continue to show our support for President Trump here in Texas,
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:23.280]  show up with me this Saturday at noon. If you want to be a part of the massive rally,
[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:26.000]  head down to Georgia, Atlanta, it's going to be huge.
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:31.760]  If you just want to be a part locally, find the state Capitol near you,
[2:08:31.760 --> 2:08:35.840]  I'd head that way this Saturday at noon. There'll probably be other people out there.
[2:08:35.840 --> 2:08:41.600]  And this is the easiest level of fighting this. If we have victory at this level,
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:49.200]  then we are lucky. We are fortunate. Because if we can't fight this battle and win in this
[2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:53.120]  next two months, folks, the only way out of this is a physical fight.
[2:08:55.280 --> 2:09:03.520]  And none of us want to turn that switch. None of us want to turn our country into that,
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:15.280]  what that would look like. But we're right in the threshold. I mean, we are in that time period.
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:22.000]  And whatever we do here in the next two months determines what we do for the next 10, 20 years.
[2:09:25.680 --> 2:09:31.600]  But this is going to be quite a struggle here legally for Trump's legal team.
[2:09:31.600 --> 2:09:36.560]  And then for we, the American people to remain steadfast
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:44.160]  and keep our will strong because it's going to be a knockdown drag out fight.
[2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:49.040]  And we have the entire media against us. We have big tech against us. Hollywood against us.
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:57.280]  Most establishment politicians against us. But we've got us. We've got Trump.
[2:09:57.280 --> 2:10:05.760]  And we've got more coming to Trump's aid. And so it's on. It's on. Now,
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:14.480]  I need to cover this news here. Alex Jones is going to be hosting the fourth hour. I'm going to
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:20.720]  host the first hour of the war room with some other breaking news with Harrison Smith and Patrick
[2:10:20.720 --> 2:10:27.280]  Howley. Then Harrison Smith has other great guests after that. But let me,
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:32.240]  let me just try to get through all of this news here.
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:39.920]  But I've only got five minutes here. So let me just go through some of these other lighter stories
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:46.400]  before we get to the major stories on the fake pandemic of COVID and then the voter fraud. But
[2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:59.200]  right now, the great reset is trending worldwide on big tech. And people are starting to realize what
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:07.520]  this is. And so now the Micey's Institute has a whole essay, the United Nations and the origins
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:13.200]  of the great reset. And it's all in there. Fake climate change, eugenics, population control,
[2:11:13.200 --> 2:11:21.280]  fake news. It's all part of the world government. So how do they bring in the world government using
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:28.960]  fear, using manipulations of trade markets and financial markets, bringing them to their knees.
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:38.400]  Then you beg for the world government stopping the food chain. This is the process they're
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:43.200]  undertaking. And so that's why America can't shut down again, folks. That's why they want to shut
[2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:50.320]  America down. And in fact, here's what they're trying to do. They're going for the third wave
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:56.880]  of shutdowns and lockdowns because, I mean, folks, the whole COVID thing is over. I mean,
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:00.880]  nobody buys it. Nobody's really scared of it. Either you wear the mask for a virtue signal,
[2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:05.360]  or you hate wearing the mask. Nobody's really afraid of COVID. The whole thing's a big joke.
[2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:11.760]  But they're going to have, it's just all about TV graphics. So they'll start seeing the graphics of
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:15.440]  spikes and cases and all this stuff. They're always, oh, Texas, more cases than ever. It's all
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:23.600]  testing. It's all BS. The tests don't even work. They're all fake. And so what they want to do is
[2:12:23.600 --> 2:12:28.240]  they want to have the third lockdown. They want to have the fake pandemic back on TV, show you
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:34.800]  the charts, get you scared again, make you wear the mask forever. And we now have major studies
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:38.240]  that show the mask doesn't work. New studies, by the way, these are brand new studies. There's
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:44.880]  dozens of them now. We'll cover that coming up. So that you go into the third wave of lockdown,
[2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:50.560]  you're pissed off. You're sick of it. You have to be wearing the mask all day. Now they say,
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:54.400]  in your home, they now have mask mandates in your home. I'm not even kidding. I mean,
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:58.240]  total tyranny, folks. Like somebody comes and does that. I mean, that's total tyranny. What do
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:11.120]  you do to tyrants? Death to tyrants. Death to tyrants. Death to tyrants. And they want to come,
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:17.200]  make you wear a mask in your home. So you're going to be so sick of it. You're going to be
[2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:22.720]  struggling financially so much. But that's when Biden comes to the rescue. And so they're going
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:27.280]  to give Biden the big victory right out of this, kind of like how they gave Obama the Nobel Peace
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:32.080]  Prize when he didn't deserve it. He was a murderous president. He ran guns.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:41.600]  They're going to give Biden the huge victory of we beat COVID. And they'll just say it. It's
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:47.680]  all TV run anyway. So the TV will just say, COVID's done. Finally, thank you, Biden. You can take
[2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:54.720]  off the mask. You can reopen the business. We have the vaccine. Biden did it. Give him the huge
[2:13:54.720 --> 2:14:03.200]  victory and then shuffle him out in a ceremony and then hand it to Kamala Harris, who was the
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:09.280]  least popular Democrat during the primaries, the least polled, the lowest. Nobody likes that
[2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:22.480]  disingenuous, fake, phony, dirty cop fraud. Nobody likes her. But see, that's the big plan. Oh,
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:27.440]  Biden saved us from COVID. But you know what? He's done his duty. He's an old man. He can shuffle
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:34.800]  off into the sunset. And then here comes dirty corrupt Kamala Harris, a dirtbag commie. The
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:40.000]  fakest laugh like a wicked witch or the West's cackle you've ever seen. And she's bringing in
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:45.200]  this, the communist government wicker than you can even blink an eye. So that's their plan.
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:52.160]  Bring in Biden saves the world from COVID. Totally fake. He gets celebrated, bring in grandiose
[2:14:52.160 --> 2:15:00.320]  ceremony and then shoehorn in Kamala Harris, the commie dictator, which to roll you up into a
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:08.880]  communist global system and sell you out like a slave. So that's their big plan. And now everyone's
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:12.800]  aware of it. And that's why everyone's talking about the great reset. And that's what COVID was
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:16.720]  what COVID was all about. And that's why they're stealing all these elections. And now the left
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:21.760]  knows this is coming, by the way, folks. See, they are really stupid, but most of it is actually an
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:26.080]  act. They know Trump's not racist. They know Trump won the election. They're pretending all of that
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:30.240]  just because they're total frauds. But now they know what's coming. And so the headline of Info
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:37.120]  Wars, the story is there. Leftists suggest reeducation camps, firing squads, banning talk radio,
[2:15:37.120 --> 2:15:41.920]  and deprogramming 75 million Trump supporters. Folks, they know they've lost. They know they're
[2:15:41.920 --> 2:15:47.360]  done. And so this is all they have left is a total election theft in plant Biden. And then they hope
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:51.840]  to put us in jail and kill us because they know we're the freedom fighters. World saved the world
[2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:56.080]  from slavery that they're bringing in. Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United
[2:15:56.080 --> 2:16:01.120]  Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Coleman Sacks. They're saying that the
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:06.000]  COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to start the death.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:11.680]  Incredible. They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:17.200]  the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus. That is a fact.
[2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:22.800]  And all the hero sheep, where the masks to go along with this are signing on to mass murder
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:27.840]  bigger than what Hitler did. That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[2:16:27.840 --> 2:16:34.000]  This is a medical world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:39.840]  IDs and coming with forced inoculations. And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to
[2:16:39.840 --> 2:16:44.560]  trigger an even bigger depression. That's the reason in FullWars.com. That's why it's vital
[2:16:44.560 --> 2:16:49.280]  for all of you to be public and to say you're not stand for this or the mass global genocide
[2:16:49.280 --> 2:16:55.200]  being caused by the planetary great reset. When President Trump said that the mainstream
[2:16:55.200 --> 2:16:59.360]  corporate media was the enemy of America, he really was telling the truth. They don't just
[2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:03.760]  work for the Communist Chinese and the globalists and the EU and the whole Hollywood, America hating,
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:09.440]  God hating crew. They literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe that they
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:15.360]  do own us and tell us who the president is, even though that's not in law. And they're just gas
[2:17:15.360 --> 2:17:20.560]  sliding the whole public over and over again saying, Joe Biden is president-elect, repeating it over
[2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:24.960]  and over again like a brainwashing mantra when it's up again to the state government to certify
[2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:30.000]  those votes. Most votes are being challenged. There's massive evidence of fraud. Again, this is so
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:34.640]  incredibly clear. Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're
[2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:39.440]  going to challenge the vote, no matter what, until every vote's counted. Well, a lot of those have
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:43.360]  been counted and there's massive fraud being discovered. So we're going to hold the course here
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:47.760]  because Joe Biden is a Communist Chinese agent. He's a globalist. He wants carbon taxes. He will
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:52.480]  destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us. This is war.
[2:17:52.480 --> 2:18:02.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:14.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Owen Schroyer sitting in for Alex in the Info Wars,
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:18.480]  World Headquarters in Austin, Texas. Alex Jones is joining us in the next hour.
[2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:25.280]  What would you do if you were a global criminal cabal
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:32.400]  bent on collapsing powerful nation states into a world government that you control?
[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:40.560]  Well, you would identify the biggest threats to that criminal cabal and the execution of your
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:50.080]  global criminal plans. That would be the United States of America. You would then identify the
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:57.680]  threat within that country against your criminal enterprise. Well, that would be Trump supporters.
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:04.240]  Well, then what would you do? You would activate your propaganda agents in the media and in the
[2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:11.840]  government and in Hollywood to indoctrinate and brainwash as many subjects as you could
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:18.880]  to make them your foot soldiers against the freedom fighters that stand in your way of your
[2:19:18.880 --> 2:19:26.560]  global criminal enterprise. So that's what's going on. And so you're going to see AOC and
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:33.040]  other leftist liberals call for jailing and reprogramming and yes, killing of Trump supporters
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:42.480]  in the next two weeks because they've been brainwashed and they have been labeled as the
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:48.480]  New World Order globalist criminal cabal foot soldiers to come in and wipe us out because they
[2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:55.120]  realize info wars. It's kind of like, well, what would you do? Well, you'd censor info wars. You'd
[2:19:55.120 --> 2:20:02.240]  censor citizen zero. You'd censor K zero. Well, we're K zero. We're citizen zero for the American
[2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:08.000]  Revolution 2.0. We're citizen zero for supporting Donald Trump, getting him over the hump of the
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:14.080]  Republican primary process. So they targeted us, censored us. Now they're targeting all the Trump
[2:20:14.080 --> 2:20:20.560]  supporters so that they can come in and mop up America and the brainwash liberal left dumbasses
[2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:25.200]  will have no idea what's going on till they're put in a cage. But that's how this always goes.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:31.360]  So they activate them as foot soldiers against us, tell them to put us in jail, tell them to kill us.
[2:20:31.360 --> 2:20:36.480]  So then when the global criminal cabal comes in, they have no resistance. We're the resistance.
[2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:42.080]  We're the freedom fighters. We are the dam that stands in the way of worldwide tyranny.
[2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:55.040]  And this next two months, we'll determine all of it. Now let's look at some of the latest headlines
[2:20:55.040 --> 2:21:00.560]  when it comes to the steal that the Democrats are currently engaged in.
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:08.960]  The Gateway Pundit, Lin Wood on Mark Levin Show. Trump won a 70% plus landslide election. He
[2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:17.600]  probably had 400 electoral votes. Lin Wood usually sells things high, but delivers high.
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:22.320]  Like when he sued CNN, I think for like 500 million or something, and he ended up getting
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:26.640]  like 200 million. So you're like, well, he went high, but it's doing about pretty big. So
[2:21:27.600 --> 2:21:32.480]  will Trump get 400 electoral votes? Probably not. Did the Democrats steal California and New York?
[2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:39.360]  Chances are probably actually. But no, Trump will get at least 300 electoral votes.
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:48.000]  I think this is a quote from Sidney Powell. I think we'll find that Trump had at least 80 million
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:54.720]  votes. Sidney Powell and the magnitude of President Trump's 2020 win. And then in this story, ladies
[2:21:54.720 --> 2:22:02.640]  and gentlemen, the Gateway Pundit has published the returns in these counties at given times.
[2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:13.440]  And look at the ratios here. They come in at a clip of 50% 0.51 for Biden, 49% 0.949 for Trump.
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:20.640]  In every time, folks, that is a statistical impossibility. That's called an algorithm that
[2:22:20.640 --> 2:22:26.560]  you put into the electronic voting machines to give the results you want. We've had Bev Harris on
[2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:35.200]  the air about this dozens of times for decades. Now it's all coming up. Patrick Halley says this
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:22:38.400]  today, and he's going to have the story at NationalFile.com and he's going to come on the
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:46.240]  war room with me at 3.30 to discuss this. Busted this internal email from Maricopa County, Arizona
[2:22:46.240 --> 2:22:50.720]  talks about issues and concerns with markers, but says they have to give voters markers anyway
[2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:57.120]  instead of ballpoint pens on election day. And we have the email. And so we're going to talk
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:01.520]  about that with Patrick Halley on the war room today and he's going to publish that at NationalFile.com.
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:09.200]  The Federalist, in Nevada, a corrupt cash for votes sheen is hiding in plain sight. And then they
[2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:13.760]  even have photos where they pull up and they give people gas cards, they give people gifts,
[2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:16.720]  and then they stand there with their ballot, and then they stand there with their gift,
[2:23:16.720 --> 2:23:21.040]  and it's all happens, all exchanged, all documented, just like what we caught in Texas
[2:23:21.040 --> 2:23:31.280]  with Project Veritas. And it's always Democrats. Every time it's the same psychological analysis.
[2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:37.840]  Why don't Trump supporters, when they organize by the millions in DC,
[2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:42.000]  or hundreds of thousands in Richmond, Virginia, or thousands in Austin, Texas, or Atlanta,
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:47.440]  or any other state capital, why don't Trump supporters loot and burn and assault and flip
[2:23:47.440 --> 2:23:51.760]  cars and engage in rioting and violence? Because we don't do it. It's not in our makeup. We're
[2:23:51.760 --> 2:23:56.800]  not criminal scum. But what happens when the Democrats organize, like Black Lives Matter,
[2:23:56.800 --> 2:24:02.000]  what happens when the Democrats organize, like Antifa? They assault, they get violent,
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:08.160]  they riot, they burn, they loot, they steal, they assault people. Same thing happens with voters,
[2:24:08.160 --> 2:24:12.720]  voter fraud. Why don't you see the stories in the affidavits and the eyewitness evidence of
[2:24:13.440 --> 2:24:17.040]  Republican, where actually you do, but they go for Biden?
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:24.480]  But you never see this with Trump people. Trump people aren't going around mailing in 30 ballots.
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:30.720]  Trump people aren't voting under their maiden name and then their married name. It's always
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:35.840]  Democrats. Every time it's the same psychology, folks, they've already done the massive psychological
[2:24:35.840 --> 2:24:41.360]  studies. We just covered it in Osium. Democrats are 10 times more likely to steal and rob.
[2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:45.600]  Conservatives are 10 times more likely to give to charity. These are mainline psychological studies.
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:49.600]  So it's the same thing. Why don't Trump supporters loot and steal? They're good people.
[2:24:49.600 --> 2:24:54.480]  Why do Democrats loot and steal? They're bad people. Why don't Trump supporters cheat to vote?
[2:24:54.480 --> 2:24:58.880]  They're good people. Why do Democrats cheat to vote? They're bad people. That's what it comes down to.
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:04.720]  Simple as that. More statistical anomalies coming. This is in the New York Times. They
[2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:08.240]  celebrate this right in front of your face, like the vote Viagra for Biden.
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:15.200]  Voters turned out in record numbers in 2020, even during a pandemic.
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:21.440]  Both major parties gained millions more votes compared with 2016. Our analysis found that
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:25.920]  votes were up in nearly every county. Actually, that's not true. It was only in four specific
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:34.000]  counties that I covered first. Now everybody's realizing it. Yeah, it's Detroit. Yeah, it's
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:41.920]  Milwaukee. It's Madison. It's Philadelphia. Duh. But here's the statistical anomalies.
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:46.720]  President Trump received 10 million more votes across the U.S. than he did four years ago,
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:52.320]  including minority areas. Wait, so how would President Trump gain 10 million votes? Well,
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:57.280]  he gained popularity. Actually, pretty simple. We saw it at his rallies. He continued to deliver.
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:00.240]  People realized that all the fake news was lying about him, the Russian collusion,
[2:26:00.240 --> 2:26:05.920]  all of it. So they voted for Trump. But then somehow magically, Joe Biden added 12 and a
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:10.320]  half million more votes over Hillary Clinton from years ago. Well, where's any evidence of that?
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:16.080]  How would that happen? Joe Biden had no rally turnout. Joe Biden didn't even have rallies.
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:21.920]  Joe Biden was completely exposed as a criminal fraud. So how is it that Biden gets more support
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:30.000]  than Trump or Hillary? And how is it that Trump gained support from 2016, even though he lost
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:34.080]  the election? Well, folks, the answer is obvious. We all know it. The Democrats cheated.
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:41.200]  Millions of illegal mail-in votes for Biden. And then millions more votes switched on the
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:46.240]  electronic voting machines from Trump to Biden. The Democrats have been caught.
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:50.400]  This is massive criminal behavior. They all need to be locked up in jail. And any Democrat voter
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:55.200]  ought to be ashamed of themselves. I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media,
[2:26:55.200 --> 2:27:00.240]  what am I most proud of when it comes to the show? And it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:04.960]  ago, doing basic research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying,
[2:27:05.520 --> 2:27:11.040]  developed the hypothesis that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transform to
[2:27:11.040 --> 2:27:16.160]  China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt. Well, now China owns the
[2:27:16.160 --> 2:27:21.440]  debt. Now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals. It turns out our analysis was
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:26.720]  absolutely dead on. But again, it wasn't that hard. The CFR and others admitted what they were doing.
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:33.520]  But still others didn't want to focus on that issue. We did. And you focused on it by supporting us
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:38.000]  at info wars. So when you go to info wars store.com and get all the great supplements, books,
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:42.960]  t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that

[2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:54.720]  all of you. I want to thank you for your support. Big tech is in league with the globalist and the
[2:27:54.720 --> 2:28:00.800]  China cops as attempting an information to against America. And when we take this country back,
[2:28:00.800 --> 2:28:08.880]  they must be held accountable. The games are over. The waiting is over. The fight is now
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:14.400]  out in the open. World government is here in the latter part of 2020 is attempting to collapse
[2:28:14.400 --> 2:28:20.080]  the world economy, set up the global digital currency and AI surveillance system and info wars

[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:30.400]  never give up in the face of this evil because we know God is watching and God is in charge and God

[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:58.240]  It really is simple. The left are into being deviant and I don't mean sexual deviant. That
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:03.200]  goes the territory. I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors deviant against their own
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:08.560]  species deviant against the order of nature. Even though that deviance is destructive and
[2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:13.760]  poisonous they still do it because they want to play God. Everything they touch they destroy.
[2:29:13.760 --> 2:29:20.240]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts. Their religion is not
[2:29:20.240 --> 2:29:24.880]  taking care of the old but euthanizing them. Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep
[2:29:24.880 --> 2:29:29.760]  their world countries in serious poverty and poor ballooning populations and then watching
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:35.840]  all that new fruit down the vine to continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over
[2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:39.520]  and over again. They truly are the children of Satan. They are the children of the devil.
[2:29:39.520 --> 2:29:44.240]  If you look at the slaves that serve them Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifested
[2:29:44.240 --> 2:30:08.640]  being a slave of Satan is not profitable. Sin is not profitable. I'm Alex Jones and this is the info war.
[2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:27.200]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Owens Royer here sitting in for Alex. We are about to have an

[2:31:39.280 --> 2:31:46.160]  go into the fake COVID pandemic news that is breaking now as well.
[2:31:49.760 --> 2:31:55.520]  You know, I hear Rudy Giuliani sound more like Trump. I hear Trump's legal team sound more like
[2:31:55.520 --> 2:32:08.240]  info wars and it is a such a relief. I really can't even put it into words because I don't really,
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:15.280]  I don't even know how to explain it. It's like knowing, you know, it's like no or like sitting
[2:32:15.280 --> 2:32:20.000]  and watching Jeopardy or something and knowing what the answer is and like screaming at the TV
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:24.480]  what the answer is or Wheel of Fortune or whatever some game show or who wants to be a millionaire
[2:32:24.480 --> 2:32:27.600]  and you know the answer and you're sitting there screaming, oh, that's the answer. That's the answer.
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:30.400]  But obviously the TV is not hearing you and then the person gets the answer wrong.
[2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:40.080]  I sat here for months, Alex Jones sat here for months and we broke down the oncoming election
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:32:48.160]  fraud so much to a T that the exact counties, the exact counties that we highlighted here at info
[2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:52.800]  wars are the ones that are investigating right now for massive fraud. Now it doesn't take a genius
[2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:58.080]  to do this. It takes a little will and so it's shocking. You think, wow, we're the only people
[2:32:58.080 --> 2:33:02.400]  that have the will not anymore. That's the beautiful thing. So it's now coming out
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:09.280]  in the exact two counties in the exact two counties I highlighted on the war room that
[2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:15.840]  they were going to steal in Wisconsin. It's now coming out. Wisconsin election will recount in
[2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:23.760]  two counties to go ahead and it's the two counties that are strong held by Democrats in Milwaukee
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:32.960]  and Madison. Duh. Duh. Duh. The Democrats going to cheat and pitch in Philadelphia. Duh. It's like
[2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:38.480]  Rudy Giuliani. What did he say? Democrats cheating in elections in Philadelphia is like getting in
[2:33:38.480 --> 2:33:46.960]  a drunken fight at a Philadelphia Eagles game. It's Garon Kied. It's all coming out.
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:52.560]  And I do think it'll go to the Supreme Court, which has me worried.
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:58.720]  But that's going for it all, folks. That's going for the homerun. That's swinging for the fences. So
[2:33:58.720 --> 2:34:04.240]  I admire that from Trump's legal team. They've obviously weighed the risk, but they realize
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:12.800]  a small victory outside of the Supreme Court is not going to be impactful enough. And trust me,
[2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:19.360]  it's not necessarily a bad thing that the Supreme Court is taking these measurements,
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:23.360]  but they don't have the spine to do it. It just comes with a territory where
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:29.520]  they don't want to decide a presidential election, okay? But they're basically in the
[2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:33.200]  position now to decide. They're going to be in the position to decide a presidential election. A
[2:34:33.200 --> 2:34:37.760]  lot of them are going to bulk at it. Unless the evidence is so overwhelming that it's not just
[2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:42.880]  this election, but it's the voting machines that are going after, then they'd be more willing to
[2:34:42.880 --> 2:34:46.320]  make a decision. But believe me, they're already saying how they, they're already discussing behind
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:50.000]  closed doors. They don't want a decision. They don't want it on their bench. They don't even want
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:56.240]  to see it. But Trump's legal team is like, no, you will see this. You will rule. You will see
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:35:03.440]  the evidence and you will stop these rigged elections from taking place. That's their pitch.
[2:35:03.440 --> 2:35:06.400]  That's their swing. That's where we're at.
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:14.160]  And it is going to be an epic battle, ladies and gentlemen. Now, oddly enough, on a different
[2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:24.720]  angle of the last elections, it's going uncovered, you have new, fresh blood into the Republican
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:31.920]  party as highlighted by Gabriela Hoffman here. There are two new GOP members who grew up under
[2:35:31.920 --> 2:35:41.040]  socialism, Cuban born Carlos Jimenez and Ukrainian born Victoria Sparts. So they're calling it the
[2:35:41.040 --> 2:35:48.000]  anti-communist squad, you know, against the, the communist squad of AOC and the like two children
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:57.760]  of Cuban immigrants, million AOC and Elvira Salazar, descendants of folks who fled socialism
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:01.920]  have much to rejoice. So now we're going to have the anti-communist squad of all these
[2:36:01.920 --> 2:36:06.080]  young Republicans in there who, by the way, folks, it's incredible. I looked at it. Most
[2:36:06.080 --> 2:36:12.240]  the new Democrats elected to Congress are white men. Most the new Republicans elected to Congress
[2:36:12.240 --> 2:36:20.560]  are women or black and Latino men. Now, one of the freshly elected Democrats who,
[2:36:20.560 --> 2:36:26.320]  my guess, has got in with a cheat in St. Louis, because I talked to people in St. Louis,
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:31.440]  nobody likes this. And they know she's an Antifa Black Lives Matter goon, Cory Bush,
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:38.800]  but she's already going full bore with her communist tactics. And she says, we want to cancel student
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:43.520]  debt and medical debt because we believe education and healthcare are human rights.
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:51.440]  Very complex stuff there. Real issues. But here's what they've already said they want to do. They
[2:36:51.440 --> 2:36:59.440]  only want to relieve medical debt and student debt for African American or Latino American
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:04.720]  Americans who happen to be in debt. And my guess is they'll, they'll, they'll strike Latino out of
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:09.280]  that too and probably just end up giving it to black Americans because they're already making
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:16.720]  statements and putting it into, I guess, whatever you want to call it, where they no longer consider
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:24.880]  Asian Americans to be minorities. Or they'll say, oh, these are not oppressed groups. And then they'll
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:33.040]  say, oh, only black Americans are oppressed groups to fully really try to empower Black Lives Matter
[2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:38.640]  and to fully indoctrinate these black people into thinking that, okay, you run America now
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:43.920]  because you're black. And so whatever you say goes because you're black. And that's what they get
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:51.760]  these people to believe. And so that's what people like Cory Bush and the Democrats are about to bring
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:58.480]  to this next Congress. I think it'll be the 117th Congress, guys. Check me on that. I think that
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:03.920]  the Congress that'll be sworn in on January 21st, I believe is what it is, or somewhere in January
[2:38:03.920 --> 2:38:18.400]  will be the 117th Congress. So that's all coming up. Also, another tech giant is leaving Silicon
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:26.400]  Valley. Keith Rayboyce is leaving Silicon Valley. He's been involved with Square, LinkedIn, Yelp,
[2:38:26.400 --> 2:38:34.640]  PayPal. He says he's moving from Silicon Valley. Whoa, I think San Francisco is just so massively
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:42.720]  improperly run and managed that it's impossible to stay here. He notes as well COVID sort of masks
[2:38:42.720 --> 2:38:47.840]  this stuff. It's not quite as obvious where people are moving to and if they've actually moved since
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:53.520]  everybody's working remotely. So basically, the Democrats have destroyed California, the Democrats
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:59.200]  have destroyed the great cities of California. Anybody with any wherewithal who wants to live in
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:04.000]  an actual functioning free society has realized that and is moving the hell out of California.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:10.080]  In fact, you now have Californians signing and forming petitions to secede from California and
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:15.600]  start now they call it the Greater Idaho and they're linking up with people in Oregon. So basically
[2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:21.040]  saying, all right, we'll give the Democrats and the commie Democrats Portland to destroy, Seattle
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:26.400]  to destroy, San Francisco to destroy, Los Angeles to destroy, Oakland to destroy, they've already
[2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:31.520]  destroyed all of it. But they're saying, here, Democrats, you keep your hell holes, you keep your
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:36.080]  crap pits of San Francisco and Portland and the rest. We're just going to secede and join the
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:40.800]  Greater Idaho. I'm not saying that's going to happen. The point is, Democrats have destroyed
[2:39:41.360 --> 2:39:46.560]  every major city they run. Everybody knows it and they're moving the hell out and it's happening
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:51.520]  right now in California. Alex Jones in an all star cast coming up. Don't go anywhere. It's time to

[2:40:50.560 --> 2:40:56.640]  Remember Hillary Clinton? Remember Pelosi? Remember Bill Clinton? Remember Obama? All of them said
[2:40:56.640 --> 2:41:01.040]  we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage. We believe it's going to look like Trump's
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:06.400]  going to win in landslides. They had the internal polls and indeed Trump won most of the states he
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:11.120]  won last time by an even bigger margin and when he was set to win the other ones they froze
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:17.600]  the seven states on election night and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:21.840]  This is completely transparent. So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not. Trump
[2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:25.920]  is not conceded. None of the states have certified the vote and now all these investigations have
[2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:31.840]  been opened up and avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been
[2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:36.800]  documented in Georgia. Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud. So ladies and
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:41.760]  gentlemen, the fix is in. They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time because the last hoax
[2:41:41.760 --> 2:41:46.240]  failed but now this is the mother of all hoaxes and if they get away with this it's the end of

[2:43:17.680 --> 2:43:22.880]  could go along with this are signing on to mass murder bigger than what hitler did that's when

[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:39.200]  mansion about 10 minutes away for a protest there we had even bigger crowd out today amazing folks
[2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:44.080]  thank you for coming out i'll be out tomorrow at high noon there at the capital i wasn't there
[2:44:44.080 --> 2:44:48.400]  today i was holding on the floor here hit a bunch of them but alexander and the rest of these other
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:52.240]  great patriots who are again they don't work for them for people think it's their own show they must
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:56.000]  work for them for us or with us no they're just other great patriots that we've coordinated with
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:45:00.800]  like all the other citizens that are here and i promised you today that they had the press conference
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:06.160]  that i was going to talk about the way to stop the great lockdown the great reset the great
[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:14.480]  end of civilization the great corporate economic siege weapon and and and lay out how to do it i'll
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:19.040]  do that tomorrow in fact i think today i'll just take probably 30 minutes where i really get down
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:22.720]  to brass tacks and and lay it out because it's really scientific it's also historical and it's
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:27.280]  a way to feed it the bottom line you've got to start talking about how this is a crime against
[2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:33.200]  humanity nuremberg trial trial Geneva convention violation how it is organized crime and how they
[2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:38.000]  are the ones behind it and how diabolical it is to create a world depression and solid a control
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  in their own words and so that's all coming up but i mean let's start with jay dyer because jay
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:47.760]  and then the next hour we're going to hit in great detail this big press conference by
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:53.600]  trumps lawyers that i i i had a chance to watch you guys were downtown we basically carried that
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:58.720]  the first two hours you guys were at the capital you were getting a lot of tweets though people were
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:04.080]  saying nine out of ten stars pretty powerful evidence being put on the media trying to cover
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:08.640]  that up that's the next hour but right now this little segment a little extra segment coming up
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:12.960]  and then most the next hour we'll get the other subject what is the great reset why is it such a
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:19.520]  big deal and how do we resist it and energize humanity understand this is 21st century warfare jay
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:25.600]  dyer this is an at least 100 year old technocratic plan you've got people like hd wells you've got
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:30.160]  people like birch and russell they said a hundred plus years ago that what they would bring in
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:36.240]  eventually was a plan to integrate every continent every nation into a global government under a
[2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:42.560]  technocratic bureaucracy unelected you don't have any say so in it and so this plan has continuity
[2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:48.880]  and it's global it's not located in one place and now we know from 2018 it's explicitly through the
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:53.120]  fourth industrial revolution claus wab's book he lays it all out he says the beginning of the book
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:58.400]  that we're going to inculcate a new ethic because of the new covenant using religious language it's
[2:46:58.400 --> 2:47:03.760]  a new covenant that will brainwash the youth mainly and so then when they come into you know
[2:47:03.760 --> 2:47:09.200]  their flourishing period they're going to accept this and it includes every aspect of society it's
[2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:15.280]  a rewrite it's a synthetic rewrite of biology it's a integration of all the economies into one
[2:47:15.280 --> 2:47:20.720]  global economy it's a cashless society it's a track and trace society and claus even goes to the
[2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:24.880]  point of mentioning microchips he says everybody's going to take a microchip it's going to be integrated
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:29.120]  into a satellite network that's what the great great he said we're going to merge humans with
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  machines and and then now you with the british prime minister saying yeah trudos says that trudos says
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:39.920]  this is the opportunity right now we've been looking for that's why claus wrote his book 2018
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:44.640]  and then he writes another book saying this is the excuse now bring it in and he says covet
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:50.000]  isn't even a threat we're using it for that why are they being honest about it uh externalization
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.400]  of the hierarchy this is the idea that once you've gotten the population to a certain point they
[2:47:54.400 --> 2:47:58.320]  think they can just say it outright and it's a gaslighting it's like a kind of we're going to
[2:47:58.320 --> 2:48:01.920]  throw this in your face by the way it doesn't exist but by the way it does that's why i think
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:06.800]  absolutely nick point as you've been laying this out what's your perspective on how we stop it
[2:48:07.680 --> 2:48:13.520]  well i think that this is basically the last stand here i think that what jay is saying is true and
[2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:18.640]  if you read the book that claus wab wrote about covet this is the excuse that they're using and
[2:48:18.640 --> 2:48:23.360]  this is the pretext this is the transition when they're going to make their move here so the
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:29.120]  way that we have to stop it is there needs to be a unity among everybody that is basically pro
[2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:34.720]  humanity this isn't even really in some sense a right-wing thing it's really more about defending
[2:48:34.720 --> 2:48:41.280]  our biological spiritual and cultural integrity as the people against you could say transhumanism
[2:48:41.280 --> 2:48:46.480]  globalism whatever you want to call it and i i really do believe that's what president trump did
[2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:52.720]  in a more implicit way in 2016 it was a lot of obama voters it went for trump in 2016 and
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:57.360]  trump was announcing it's about you the people a human world a world for humans he was directly
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:03.040]  challenging it exactly it wasn't the typical beltway conservatism articulated by people like
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:07.200]  william f buckley or even ronald reagan or something like that it was something i think
[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:12.320]  there was a little bit more with the universal appeal a universal call and a cry out against
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:17.360]  what i think everybody's been witnessing happening which is a society that is not human and the
[2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:23.280]  total homogenization of the entire planet the destruction of culture the destruction of humanity
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:27.200]  it is really an alien takeover whatever's behind it it seems like human ollie alexander
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:32.560]  you want to comment on this yeah i think that the reason i think all of us are participating in
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:38.240]  stop appeal isn't just for stop appeal it's not for trump it's not about this election
[2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:42.560]  it's that they've been dogging us for six months seven months eight months and they're trying to
[2:49:42.560 --> 2:49:47.280]  break the human spirit so you know if i were to answer the question that you asked nick it was well
[2:49:47.280 --> 2:49:54.320]  how do we win we build them around we build a strange alliance between pro-human people and say
[2:49:54.320 --> 2:49:59.600]  we're not going to cooperate with your lockdowns we don't believe your stupid media we're not going
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:05.200]  to take your stupid vaccine we are going to survive what we've survived as a species rough and
[2:50:05.200 --> 2:50:10.800]  intolerant and we believe in self-government and i just i i'm not going to do anything else so
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:16.880]  stop the steel lockdowns prevent the great reset uh what we need is actually reset in the social
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:22.640]  contract and and that's what we're i think all pushing for absolutely because the imf the world
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:26.960]  bank the big central banks are the most ruthless people that go in and try to bankrupt third world
[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:30.560]  countries try to dehumanize people try to get people in debt and now they're trying to destroy
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:36.320]  the economy to put us in debt calling that helping the poor it is the most cynical sickening evil
[2:50:36.320 --> 2:50:43.600]  by claus schwaab and justin trodo and all of them and the weird new age cult like heaven's you know
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:49.920]  gate hellbop type way they say it is really freaking people out and they're going wait a
[2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:54.000]  minute i heard this from decades from alex shones and others now what's happening i was on the
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:58.400]  drawing board now and they got everything lined up all the army set up everything prepared and
[2:50:58.400 --> 2:51:04.240]  they've now launched it so nothing gets better by complying it only gets better by resisting
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:08.160]  and they want to bankrupt things to make you poor so they can give you a universal income
[2:51:08.720 --> 2:51:14.160]  at a subsistence level to dictate the terms of your surrender which means the destruction of you
[2:51:14.160 --> 2:51:20.480]  and your family yeah and and it's the terms of your survival you know if you don't take the ubi
[2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:25.200]  you don't eat you can't take the train you can't take a plane you can't sit your kids to college
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:29.920]  it's not just this peer pressure the psychological thing they want to kill you if you don't take
[2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:33.840]  the mark and they're going to sell it to you as enlightenment you see what big tech does
[2:51:33.840 --> 2:51:40.000]  with just the the the proto version of this j it's all about control all about intimidation all
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:45.360]  about social credit score all about censorship all about starving you this is just the first wave
[2:51:46.480 --> 2:51:52.480]  we had facebook rolled out to us ultimately as the beginning stages of this social media was
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:58.240]  the preparation for the social credit system so the same people that do that they roll it out in
[2:51:58.240 --> 2:52:06.160]  china it's the same yeah yeah and so what that's going to be is again this integrated system and
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:10.960]  if you go all the way back to play dough go back to the ancient world play dough said control the
[2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:15.920]  lower part of the pyramid by making it communal making sure they don't have private property
[2:52:15.920 --> 2:52:19.680]  claus says you're not going to own anything you're going to be happy you will be happy
[2:52:19.680 --> 2:52:24.000]  right he's sitting there in his blow fell outfit literally looking like blow where's the actual
[2:52:24.000 --> 2:52:27.600]  costume of hollywood people right and he's sitting up there saying you will be happy
[2:52:27.600 --> 2:52:31.840]  you're not going to own anything you're going to have a circular economy where you rent everything
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:36.080]  you rent everything from jeff basil an amazon drum is going to deliver it to your door everything's
[2:52:36.080 --> 2:52:40.800]  rented you don't own anything and that's for that lower class so it's a and then they can direct
[2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:45.920]  for every move yeah it's a it's a communism at the bottom and then there's this uh upper class
[2:52:45.920 --> 2:52:51.040]  of the bureaucrat elite that are totally free from any laws that's literally the system so it's a mix
[2:52:51.040 --> 2:52:57.760]  and that's what nick rockefeller famously told um erin russo before he died is that that was a plan
[2:52:58.400 --> 2:53:03.680]  right yeah to uh feminism plays into that he said that uh to get the women into the workforce and
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:08.320]  then there's a whole other bundle of people attacks right then also in the long run destroys the family
[2:53:08.320 --> 2:53:13.040]  you have that berylson memo the the Planned Parenthood memo from the night that late 60s 6869
[2:53:13.040 --> 2:53:19.280]  uh where they state that the jaffy memo that they will bring all of this in as a social plan
[2:53:19.280 --> 2:53:23.680]  ultimately to get rid of the family that's the goal and then what they said we're going to have a
[2:53:23.680 --> 2:53:27.520]  global government using the threadable virus and the rockefeller plans and all of it yeah
[2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:33.280]  well and i think what people have to realize when you ask about what we could do to stop this
[2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:37.840]  in my opinion one of the biggest things that's keeping people from getting out in the streets
[2:53:37.840 --> 2:53:43.120]  and taking action is the fear of repercussions of opposing the system and what people have to
[2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:48.880]  begin to realize is that if we lose this battle and if this transition is allowed to take place
[2:53:48.880 --> 2:53:54.640]  that's it that's the end there is nothing worse than what's coming when they talk about no private
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:54:00.160]  property circular economy mass surveillance that's another aspect and the article that we're all
[2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:05.920]  talking about i think from 2016 at the closing part of the article it's very interesting there's
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:11.440]  sort of some foreshadowing in the end they say well the elites have all my information they know
[2:54:11.440 --> 2:54:15.600]  everything about me i hope that no one will use that against me and it's sort of like
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:22.480]  exactly exactly right the implicit thread that at any moment in time we can be crushed by the elites
[2:54:22.480 --> 2:54:29.040]  the point is this the repercussions now are maybe lose your job maybe get called racist get called
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:33.120]  some kind of standard tell us what the future repercussions are submitting now will destroy
[2:54:33.120 --> 2:54:37.200]  you forever hour number four with all of our great guests i'm alex john stay with us
[2:54:40.880 --> 2:54:46.320]  most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist
[2:54:46.320 --> 2:54:52.160]  chinese and the united nations and now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient
[2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:57.280]  the worst australian models of complete lockdown so you can't even leave your house for months and
[2:54:57.280 --> 2:55:02.720]  months are being announced and in germany the police are using giant armored tanks with water
[2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:07.840]  cannons to blast men women and children that protest the fact that merkel the dictator has
[2:55:07.840 --> 2:55:13.120]  put them under her control that's right she's been rigging elections for years and years and the same
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:18.480]  thing is coming here to the united states this is world government in philadelphia they've announced
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:23.760]  four people or more seen together will be arrested they're announcing the christmas is cancelled
[2:55:23.760 --> 2:55:29.280]  this is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you to take red of all your due process
[2:55:29.280 --> 2:55:35.840]  and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet how long have we warned you about this
[2:55:35.840 --> 2:55:40.000]  but you can fight back america is the last bastion stop submitting
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:50.160]  it's all on record yale harvard princeton stanford they were all hired a year ago
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:55.920]  and then against six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:56:00.960]  pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations and they talk about calling people
[2:56:00.960 --> 2:56:06.560]  heroes that do it they talk about shaming those that don't this is all been psychologically tested
[2:56:07.680 --> 2:56:12.240]  it's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days you notice
[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:17.520]  now they say it's permanent that's how it works oh just put these handcuffs on the serial killer
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:23.280]  says the woman in the parking lot everything will be all right no now we've already put the handcuffs
[2:56:23.280 --> 2:56:29.520]  on and we're in the serial killer's van he's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:34.880]  torture us to death that's the allegory we got to bust out of this thing now we got to say no now
[2:56:34.880 --> 2:56:39.280]  we got to make a run for it now but we still can't once he gets us in that basement it's going to
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:56.960]  get a lot a lot worse folks so stop submitting you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:01.440]  i'll be very very clear with listeners we as those that are informed and understand what's
[2:57:01.440 --> 2:57:06.160]  happening we need to go out and warn everybody so getting back to what you were saying nick
[2:57:06.160 --> 2:57:12.080]  pointes about what's coming next what they've taken now the social credit score what comes next
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:16.240]  once they get full power in control they want to get jay dyer and ollie alexander's taking on
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:22.320]  yeah go for oh you want me first no no you were saying what's coming next that's right yeah well
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:26.560]  what's coming next is far worse than what's happening right now that's the point people are
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:32.080]  afraid to speak out right now people are afraid to stand up and each day is only only going to be
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:37.440]  worse than the previous day as far as consequences go 20 years ago was easier than 10 years ago 10
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:43.040]  years ago easier than today and people have to start to consider that each day into the future
[2:57:43.040 --> 2:57:47.760]  it will become more difficult to challenge this afterwards and look at what's happening right now
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:53.520]  with big tech it wasn't nearly as bad on big tech as far as censorship goes even just four years ago
[2:57:53.520 --> 2:57:58.720]  i remember a time when there were three people he could name them on one hand that had been banned
[2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:04.320]  from twitter there's speech by nine percent right yeah exactly and now in the past just four to five
[2:58:04.320 --> 2:58:09.520]  years there's nobody remaining on youtube there's virtually nobody remaining on twitter or facebook
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:15.120]  facebook now passes rules and regulations that are explicitly editorial in nature they say if
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:20.000]  you support q anon you can't have a facebook account if you're a white separatist you can't
[2:58:20.000 --> 2:58:25.360]  have a facebook account and people that are afraid of standing up now must realize that this trend
[2:58:25.360 --> 2:58:30.960]  will not reverse unless we begin to resist there is no natural pushback there is nothing that we
[2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:36.880]  can expect to create a vacuum by exactly exactly right so it's it's terrible and people have to
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:42.960]  start rising up i think this in in the sense that the president winning outright this election
[2:58:42.960 --> 2:58:47.680]  might have been the best outcome i think the next best outcome is what's happening right now
[2:58:47.680 --> 2:58:52.880]  because the widespread fraud is galvanizing people finally to take action when they hadn't been doing
[2:58:52.880 --> 2:59:02.320]  so before jager holly yeah i think the the next phase we saw in the last year a a an attack on
[2:59:02.320 --> 2:59:06.240]  the economy i think a lot of people are overlooking the fact that this is about the consolidation
[2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:11.280]  removal of cash consolidation of middle class wealth transferring it to the big box stores the
[2:59:11.280 --> 2:59:17.280]  elite that was a big part of covet and what's next is the next phase of that i literally think
[2:59:17.280 --> 2:59:21.920]  that what they want to do is tank the economy and when they do that everybody's going to be
[2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:27.680]  begging for the salvation that will come from oh grant me the the ubi grant me this uh you know
[2:59:27.680 --> 2:59:32.160]  capitalism oh they say that's the plan we're gonna bankrupt the old system to fix it everybody
[2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:36.400]  gets things free but it's really consolidation of wealth and making us poor this is what they do
[2:59:36.400 --> 2:59:40.400]  they will they will bring the problems they'll blame everyone else for the problems that they
[2:59:40.400 --> 2:59:45.360]  bring and then let's say oh by the way we have a fix for this and our fix by the way is worse than
[2:59:45.360 --> 2:59:52.160]  what you had before so it's intentionally destroying the existing system uh popping it basically big
[2:59:52.160 --> 2:59:55.360]  debt bubble i think they're eventually going to pop that and then that's right they're popping the
[2:59:55.360 --> 3:00:00.080]  bubble they created and then blaming it on covet and then using the bubble collapse to give them
[3:00:00.080 --> 3:00:05.680]  the created more power exactly yeah i mean just think about this when we normalized china and that
[3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:11.120]  was a republican problem with nixon and kissinger when we normalized china for their products and
[3:00:11.120 --> 3:00:15.760]  their manufacturing you might have said well there was pent up american demand and it may have made
[3:00:15.760 --> 3:00:22.720]  sense but stealth wise china came in with their funny money and their currency and we need them
[3:00:22.720 --> 3:00:27.440]  for products so we can't call them out on their currency knowing damn well that they are going
[3:00:27.440 --> 3:00:33.520]  to pop the dollar one day and then oh this magic chinese you know social credit score digital dollar
[3:00:33.520 --> 3:00:37.920]  is going to be what you buy oil and it's going to be how you transport your kids to the country that
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:43.200]  doesn't have the riots it's a real sick me problem i think everybody's waking up what's inspiring to
[3:00:43.200 --> 3:00:48.720]  me though you know nick talked about this uh at our rally outside the georgia state capitol today
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:54.640]  was that you know if you look at it we should be losing but somehow god is waking up patriots
[3:00:54.640 --> 3:01:00.480]  godfaring people and saying stand up and resist and i think everyone's resisting and coalescing
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:05.520]  around this central planning they're bad central planners they mean to kill the poor they mean to
[3:01:05.520 --> 3:01:10.080]  kill the sick and then they mean to rule over the rest of us and i think that you know i'm just not
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:13.440]  going to go into that world and i think that's where everybody else is too exactly yeah we're
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:17.680]  going to 60 second break and come back and get into the big picture and then focus back in on the
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:24.240]  election which is all a microcosm of this globalist takeover but they are bad planners on purpose they
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:28.480]  want us out of the way they got power because they want to wipe us out they believe in a post
[3:01:28.480 --> 3:01:33.520]  industrial post human future and so it's just going to get worse from here on out until we finally
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:38.240]  push back we'll be right back on the other side in full wars dot com and news wars dot com are the
[3:01:38.240 --> 3:01:43.760]  sites and on video you're sharing those links folks record traffic the sites big tech is pissed

[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:26.800]  conference today but i wanted to get your take if you got a chance to watch it all i i i got a chance
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:31.840]  to see the first three quarters or so but i was working behind the scenes on some big big things
[3:03:31.840 --> 3:03:35.920]  that are about to happen what was your take on the press conference i thought from what i saw
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:41.360]  they really brought the proof as they'd say arby's has got the meats i mean they they brought the
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:49.280]  meat here well alex i think as far as what we wanted to see in here it pretty much was a full
[3:03:49.280 --> 3:03:53.680]  delivery outside of just having these victories and courts which will just have to you know be
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:04:01.040]  patient wait for the process to play out but hearing and seeing sydney powell and rudy juliani
[3:04:01.040 --> 3:04:06.960]  and jenna ellis step up to the plate have this historical two hour press conference and say
[3:04:06.960 --> 3:04:12.400]  hey everything that we've been saying for the longest time to try to expose our rigged elections
[3:04:12.400 --> 3:04:17.200]  has been such a relief alex i had so many people that reach out to me yesterday saying oh and you're
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:20.960]  on edge you sound frustrated you know you're you're contankerous what's going on i'm saying hey man
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:25.520]  they're stealing our election i'm in the arena nobody's coming to fight but then you had that
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:32.880]  meteoric crash landing into our political system today with that press conference and i mean my
[3:04:32.880 --> 3:04:37.280]  goodness i mean i i'm just afraid of what's going to happen with the left just embracing this fake
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:41.920]  presidential election of joe biden and dancing and slobbering all over themselves over it and then
[3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:45.920]  it's all taken away from them oh and shroy are amazing job or i'm coming up three p.m. and fours
[3:04:45.920 --> 3:04:49.920]  dot com we also got ali elexander here on his own amazing twitter we had hundreds of thousands
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:54.000]  watching last night when he was streaming it was great to be there with you we're here in georgia
[3:04:54.000 --> 3:04:59.600]  here in Atlanta georgia would stop the steel we've had big victories in in places like michigan big
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:05.200]  things happening up in pennsylvania we have this big press conference with juliani where most folks
[3:05:05.200 --> 3:05:10.720]  are saying nine out of ten stars deliver massive proof affidavits witnesses of systemic fraud the
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:16.640]  same fraud nationwide we've got jay dyer here we've also got nick fointes no one needs any
[3:05:16.640 --> 3:05:21.440]  introduction let's just go down the line with your take on where this fight is and the feedback
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:26.480]  you've got jay dyer i think i think we're going to see a lot of victory here i think we're seeing
[3:05:26.480 --> 3:05:31.680]  people wake up to the fact that we have been lied to consistently for a long time by the media we
[3:05:31.680 --> 3:05:36.240]  were told for the last four years that russia stole the election they hacked the election they gave
[3:05:36.240 --> 3:05:40.880]  it to donald trump it all collapsed actually like ten times the last four years it collapsed it was
[3:05:40.880 --> 3:05:45.840]  shown to be a fraud uh and now we're being told that there is no election for that doesn't exist
[3:05:45.840 --> 3:05:50.800]  no such thing it's never happened what that's crazy but no people aren't buying that right 70
[3:05:50.800 --> 3:05:55.840]  million people plus vote for trump they know what's going on they know that this is a fraud it's a lie
[3:05:55.840 --> 3:06:00.960]  and it's obvious there are there's mountains of of fraud the idea that it doesn't exist is ludicrous
[3:06:00.960 --> 3:06:07.760]  and i think the the delusion is starting to break on on the masses right yeah i basically have the
[3:06:07.760 --> 3:06:12.560]  same opinion i think probably the worst case scenario is if the democrats tried to steal this
[3:06:12.560 --> 3:06:18.880]  election and then people didn't even know about it because there was probably a plausible scenario
[3:06:18.880 --> 3:06:24.480]  where widespread and mass voter fraud was committed and the only people that were calling it out were
[3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:30.160]  called conspiracy theorists it was a fringe sort of opinion to have that the election was stolen
[3:06:30.160 --> 3:06:36.000]  but you see that most republicans think that the election was stolen and it was widespread it was
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:40.320]  massive it was blatant and they really made a big mistake with that because it's not like this was
[3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:45.840]  a subtle voter fraud this was massive voter fraud hundreds of thousands of fake ballots and just
[3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:52.000]  about every single swing state this was a huge operation and it's unignorable and it's indefensible
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:56.320]  and it's gotten to the point where people are waking up the masses are talking about it on
[3:06:56.320 --> 3:07:00.560]  twitter they're taking to the streets and whereas even the republicans were content to ignore it
[3:07:00.560 --> 3:07:05.120]  for a time now even they are being dragged into this fight like we're trying to do in george
[3:07:05.120 --> 3:07:09.600]  with brian kemp they're being dragged in kicking and screaming and i think this is maybe the best
[3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:15.280]  thing that can happen because it's destroying the legitimacy of the system well that's right nobody
[3:07:15.280 --> 3:07:19.840]  wants to be robbed but once you're robbed you start fighting back we're being robbed there's a
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:25.440]  globalist takeover happen yes right and and people can see that now and and for a long time you've
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:32.080]  been talking about this for for decades for years and it was for many years people thought that that
[3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:35.600]  was something that was out there they thought that was some kind of a radical thing i was just
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:39.200]  reading the books they wrote and you know like jay's doing now and he's reading their new books
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:44.640]  i mean they admit all this that's okay right well the problem is they control the media they control
[3:07:44.640 --> 3:07:48.880]  the media so if all people are watching is network television they're not going to talk about what
[3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:54.640]  they're right your time said uh the great reset doesn't exist i mean what what is the psychology
[3:07:54.640 --> 3:07:59.360]  there where they they say we're going to take over y'all don't more money it's going to cut your
[3:07:59.360 --> 3:08:03.600]  carbon we're going to starve you that it's good but it doesn't exist well and they do that with
[3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:08.480]  so many different narratives and once they deny that it's happening great for well they say it
[3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:12.880]  about the great replacement the reset is a conspiracy theory but at the same time world
[3:08:12.880 --> 3:08:18.080]  economic forum says same day this is what we're undertaking with the coronavirus and and i
[3:08:18.080 --> 3:08:22.240]  mentioned it a second ago they say that with the great replacement as well when you talk about mass
[3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:27.280]  immigration you talk about the globalization of the population through people pouring into europe
[3:08:27.280 --> 3:08:32.560]  and america they say that is some kind of horrible conspiracy theory and then they turn around a few
[3:08:32.560 --> 3:08:38.000]  days later and they'll write in the la times the hill new york times a lannick that demographic
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:43.040]  change is turning america blue demographic change is saving the democratic party is is is
[3:08:43.040 --> 3:08:48.000]  quote the replacement migration and then they get the folks here and don't condition them in a loving
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:53.120]  way about freedom and justice of capitalism but instead it's about radical environmentalism racism
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:59.920]  post-industrial systems olly olexander what do you make right now of of this press conference the
[3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:04.320]  feedback you're getting what's happening because you know at first it was kind of uphill battle
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:07.920]  and it's still an uphill battle but as more evidence comes out people are getting more optimistic
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:13.040]  of the democrats admit they're getting scared well the first week uh losses should say the first four
[3:09:13.040 --> 3:09:19.040]  days we had 30 000 people turn out around the united states then that led us to a week later
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:25.920]  where we're in washington dc so we're looking at about 220 to 240 000 that turned out across the
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:31.360]  nation if you know you take the dc numbers and you you put them low and hopefully this weekend
[3:09:31.360 --> 3:09:35.440]  we'll have even more across the united states but i want everybody to understand this if there was no
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:41.200]  stop the steel if people did not take the streets under different hashtags different groups who cares
[3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:46.480]  from their work you would have conceded there wouldn't have been room there's all these traders
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:51.760]  in the administration and the uh and the campaign and we needed time for those people to leave for
[3:09:51.760 --> 3:09:56.880]  the new legal team to come in there was no sydney pal there was no rudy and guess what you know rudy
[3:09:56.880 --> 3:10:02.400]  is a little weird not the best but we're doing what we can for this country all the insiders
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:06.080]  bailing has actually given us a chance to right and you know the bible says out of the mouth of
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:11.840]  babes so here we are we are the misfits we are the crazy ones rushing the gate but we are the ones
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:17.760]  winning last night in in in michigan you and i actually broke news people could tell you know i
[3:10:17.760 --> 3:10:21.840]  said hey you're gonna have news in the morning coming out of michigan with these two brave people
[3:10:21.840 --> 3:10:26.720]  they're gonna hold the line it was then announced uh late that night after the periscope that you
[3:10:26.720 --> 3:10:31.760]  and i did that they did hold the line was scots in this morning held the line and so they're not
[3:10:31.760 --> 3:10:36.480]  going to certify their election and here we are in georgia telling brian camp that you're going to
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:41.280]  get a primary or you're going to call a special session to relieve yourself of duty so the state
[3:10:41.280 --> 3:10:45.200]  legislator can choose the electors we're winning alex we're winning the tide is turning and and
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:49.360]  again we're pessimistic when things are pessimistic but just we're going to talk more about the
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:55.040]  internals of this and the externals of this but again this is an amazing time to be alive this
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:11:00.240]  is amazing behind the scenes everybody uses the word surreal because we've all been talking about
[3:11:00.240 --> 3:11:06.240]  this on our platforms different aspects of it but no one thought we'd live it now right well yeah
[3:11:06.240 --> 3:11:10.560]  it's a world historical moment and we're living through it and the thing that we had been talking
[3:11:10.560 --> 3:11:16.080]  about for years and people all to the me talking about this for decades we're now seeing them make
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:21.760]  their move the move that we talked about for so long and people said it was a conspiracy theory
[3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:27.360]  that's crazy they could never do something like this we're seeing it happen the coronavirus the
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:33.040]  mass riots the huge election fraud the lockdowns you know if you had said five years ago that the
[3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:37.840]  globalists are going to tell us you know the world economic forum the un would tell us it's not
[3:11:37.840 --> 3:11:43.360]  legal to go to a church it's not legal to open your business nobody would believe it oh but you
[3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:48.640]  can go riot i mean it's it's right well and if people told you years ago that there would be
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:52.960]  giant riots in the cities and the media would never cover it that in fact actually they would call
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:57.520]  them peaceful protests that they would make up out of thin air they talk about right wing militias
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:02.400]  going to these things i see the looting going on at the liquor stores and the targets it is definitely
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:07.360]  not right wing militia is a multinational globalist attack to overthrow civilization of mega slaves
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:11.040]  and they never get in trouble so that's why they keep trying it that's what i was going to stay on
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:15.280]  my own show today in the main rock body and we'll come back from breaking into this how do we punish
[3:12:15.280 --> 3:12:20.080]  these globalists how do we make people know that this is modern warfare and criminal and a violation
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:26.400]  of the nirnberg uh code here how do we well we do that by continuing to do what we're doing right now
[3:12:26.400 --> 3:12:33.600]  so we are getting uh you know mass numbers mass awakening ipad explosive growth you know you
[3:12:33.600 --> 3:12:37.920]  let me come on and talk about the great reset this stuff i mean this is everybody's making
[3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:43.200]  these flow it's eight hours together when we come back let's talk about your ideas of how we fight
[3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:52.000]  now during this crazy time because resistance is the key we'll be right back on the other side
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:05.760]  now it's easier than ever to have band dot video on your iphone simply go to band dot video with

[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:54.320]  cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:14:00.000]  facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:06.560]  condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:12.880]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride
[3:14:12.880 --> 3:14:18.640]  levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:26.320]  responses in joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:33.280]  oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:39.920]  it worked for my family and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:46.240]  that pertain to reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info
[3:14:46.240 --> 3:15:07.200]  wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show and we are back i'm alex jones with
[3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:13.040]  olly alexander nick pointe as of course j dire and j you are getting into their end game where
[3:15:13.040 --> 3:15:17.680]  they'll take us if we don't submit and then how do we identify these folks in the war they're waging
[3:15:17.680 --> 3:15:20.640]  actually let them know they're going to be punished there's gonna be retribution because
[3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:25.920]  they feel like we're just animals and it doesn't matter how they test on us is getting pigs well
[3:15:25.920 --> 3:15:30.480]  if you look at history every time empires have tried to do this they crumble they don't they're
[3:15:30.480 --> 3:15:35.280]  not able to sustain what they try to do because to run this gigantic of an empire it requires a
[3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:41.040]  whole lot of lies it's a constantly profitable lies and this lie is especially unique because
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:45.760]  it's global and it's it's including all this tech stuff so what i was saying is that it's a spiritual
[3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:50.640]  delusion that's the main problem is that people think that if i go along for this amount of time
[3:15:50.640 --> 3:15:55.440]  if i go along for a little longer oh it's gonna go away oh if we if biden goes it comes to hill
[3:15:55.440 --> 3:16:01.200]  eventually get rid of this lot no it's not going away it's sucking you in yes it's a it's a it's a
[3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:05.840]  getting in the creeper van with with the child molester doesn't save you you know buying buying
[3:16:05.840 --> 3:16:10.640]  the lottery ticket doesn't save you going with a scam only gets you deeper yeah it's it's a psychic
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:16.000]  vampirism they get off on the the you buying into the delusion and if you if you stop buying into
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:20.240]  delusion it goes away like that's the only way to fight it's to stop buying into and that's what
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:27.200]  trump said just get used to it uh dr atlas said it's basically a giant hoax uh you have to resist
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:32.400]  this and rise up i mean finally trump gets it yeah exactly and and he's been saying for a long time
[3:16:32.400 --> 3:16:37.840]  he's been saying in speeches that this is a bunch of nonsense it's ridiculous i mean how absurd is
[3:16:37.840 --> 3:16:44.480]  it that the same cnn scientists that say that this is not going to attack a rally that involves
[3:16:44.480 --> 3:16:49.680]  prototype looting and rioting and a study saying study show black lives matter helps stop
[3:16:49.680 --> 3:16:55.520]  corona maris but trump rallies aren't it yeah it actually gets even dumber we we predicted this too
[3:16:55.520 --> 3:17:01.440]  that they would declare racism a health crisis so the health directors of major cities decided
[3:17:01.440 --> 3:17:08.800]  to give black lives matter and antifa thugs a a pass by declaring racism a health emergency so
[3:17:08.800 --> 3:17:13.440]  they're like well even if there is a corona virus bump this was more of a health emergency
[3:17:13.440 --> 3:17:18.960]  we are living in a world where you have dark skin you get bill gates's vaccine first we really care
[3:17:18.960 --> 3:17:25.680]  about you and why didn't anthony fouchy give every black american vitamin d that cost 25
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:30.800]  dollars a year to give everyone a year supply of vitamin d black folks need a lot more sun
[3:17:30.800 --> 3:17:37.520]  and so any more vitamin oh oh no s at the end the black folk uh no but um look white people
[3:17:37.520 --> 3:17:42.000]  they can go out on the sun they need a half hour of vitamin d uh from the sun a day black people
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:47.920]  need an average of uh three hours oprah actually says that she's fat because she lives in chicago
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:53.040]  and and it's too cloudy so there's a whole big controversy about that well maybe um it could
[3:17:53.040 --> 3:17:58.880]  be that she eats a lot but um so so that's what's going on is they don't actually care about our
[3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:03.920]  immune system people have to remember in february late february they came out and said that you cannot
[3:18:03.920 --> 3:18:08.720]  boost your immune system go look at it and so what we do know is that you need to be taking zinc
[3:18:08.720 --> 3:18:13.360]  you need to be taking vitamin d uh you can take some magnesium and some other stuff but look i've
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:17.520]  traveled this whole pandemic and i'm glad you brought this up they always go my god they're not
[3:18:17.520 --> 3:18:22.800]  wearing masks 500 000 or more at the capital where are we i'm at hundreds of these rallies i'm great
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:28.160]  because i'm taking zinc vitamin c yeah totally well and it's a war against our bodies it's a war
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:33.360]  against our minds it always has been and you know you talk about psychic vampirism it's also
[3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:38.960]  a form of biological vampirism i think the end game for them is really it's about immortality
[3:18:38.960 --> 3:18:44.480]  when you start to get into transhumanism and what they want to do integrating the biological with
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:50.880]  the machine i think it's on us they do and we are all supposed to be fed into this great big
[3:18:50.880 --> 3:18:56.400]  societal machine like twilight green basically so that they can live forever i think that people
[3:18:56.400 --> 3:19:02.720]  like george soros and uh the head of expendable that's right and and we are all going to die
[3:19:02.720 --> 3:19:07.440]  essentially they will steal our life force so that they can perpetuate themselves this like
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:12.160]  technocratic elite it's disgusting what they're doing and they say that themselves they do they
[3:19:12.160 --> 3:19:16.560]  and and they're not even hiding it that's the scariest thing people don't know about it because
[3:19:16.560 --> 3:19:20.240]  it's those people that control all the media if they don't tell us i want to get into the election
[3:19:20.240 --> 3:19:24.880]  but the election is just an expression of this takeover and they were arrogant before we were
[3:19:24.880 --> 3:19:29.600]  exposing them and beavering and and getting the word out many millions were they've got to be freaked
[3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:34.240]  out now because we already told everybody it's coming now they've launched the attack it's not
[3:19:34.240 --> 3:19:38.720]  going to go the way they thought j dire what do you think well yeah i mean you're able to have what
[3:19:38.720 --> 3:19:45.440]  within a week a gigantic crowd a million in dc this is insane right so this is a message to the media
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:50.560]  that no matter how many lies and no matter how much bs you clamp on everybody's mind we're becoming
[3:19:50.560 --> 3:19:55.760]  immune to your horseman it's not working it's falling apart and within no time people can show
[3:19:55.760 --> 3:20:01.520]  up at a rally right i can drive six hours we're here people are here uh that is i think a threat
[3:20:01.520 --> 3:20:06.240]  to the media the media knows that they are losing uh they've been they've been doubling down right they
[3:20:06.240 --> 3:20:10.880]  won't back off they double down and it only hurts them so they're destroying themselves that's our
[3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:15.920]  great i remember gave us like five years ago they said they should not it was slob it was they should
[3:20:15.920 --> 3:20:20.960]  not have money to be able to come here and protest us we must to make them poor that's a quote i got
[3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:25.360]  to pull up he said we want to make them poor so they can't protest us that's all this is they stole
[3:20:25.360 --> 3:20:30.480]  all the wealth now they want to bankrupt us so we're like literally can't even get food it's it's
[3:20:30.480 --> 3:20:35.920]  a good i'm going to do it for you he's like you said a blow felled little bellies out he's a little
[3:20:35.920 --> 3:20:42.080]  suit on he's like i'm going to love you by killing you he's wearing like space medallions like he's
[3:20:42.080 --> 3:20:46.160]  from from space you're talking about aliens uh in that video that they put out that actually
[3:20:46.160 --> 3:20:50.880]  twitter deleted that did you see that had over a million views from 2016 the world economic form
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:56.160]  with their eight point plan yeah and they had to delete that but one of those was about maybe we'll
[3:20:56.160 --> 3:21:02.160]  find alien life and you'll submit to this kind of new et mythology of pants we want to take ships
[3:21:02.160 --> 3:21:08.000]  and humans are bad and there's an alien going to help you obviously are is it interdimensional is
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:12.400]  it spiritual how are they they or they want to be the aliens like Ray Kurzweil said i don't believe
[3:21:12.400 --> 3:21:16.880]  in god i'm gonna be gone well if you watch a bunch of alien movies what are the aliens always doing
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:22.800]  the very thing that the elites do so i think in movies aliens represent our elite because they
[3:21:22.800 --> 3:21:27.360]  always want to depopulate where they're the warlocks we're the eloy yeah you're you're not
[3:21:27.360 --> 3:21:32.800]  involved right uh you don't have gigantic heads like the aliens have uh you you need to uh be
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:40.320]  experimented on by the way yourself you had a big face i don't know about a big head
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:45.600]  no but it's interesting too because these aliens usually are naked right and they're not
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:51.040]  ashamed of their nakedness and uh they're without sin they're you know these these pre-human
[3:21:51.040 --> 3:21:55.440]  creatures pre-garden creatures it's just it's all stupid it's that it's really kind of interesting
[3:21:55.440 --> 3:21:59.840]  that we're all talking about uh something the same thing but yes they want they believe in
[3:21:59.840 --> 3:22:04.720]  internal life and we believe in internal life but they believe that heaven must be manifested
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:10.000]  here and we know to give our free will to make heaven god says we have free will and then choose
[3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:15.600]  freedom and we get out right and so this is the last fight and it's amazing what everyone has
[3:22:15.600 --> 3:22:20.160]  been able to accomplish together when i'm on the phone i mean you you watched me i take about 150
[3:22:20.160 --> 3:22:26.640]  calls now a day and it's there's no ego everyone's just put bodies in the streets no staging no permits
[3:22:26.640 --> 3:22:32.400]  no lights don't ask me to make a speech candidate it's all about just fighting the system and what
[3:22:32.400 --> 3:22:38.080]  i'm telling you is i think this i think we were at the 99 out of 100 we were about to die and they
[3:22:38.080 --> 3:22:42.240]  need us to be their slaves so the good thing is that we can't lose if we stay in the streets we
[3:22:42.240 --> 3:22:48.400]  cannot lose because they need slaves to build the pyramids and i'm not building their damn pyramid
[3:22:48.400 --> 3:22:52.720]  well they were building a pyramid and i was and we were all free i'd build pyramids but they're
[3:22:52.720 --> 3:22:57.920]  a metaphor i know it's a metaphor but they're is that really a metaphor i didn't get that
[3:22:57.920 --> 3:23:02.000]  it could be an analogy i don't know if i understand the difference no no no you're right it's a
[3:23:02.000 --> 3:23:07.440]  hierarchical up-down situation but but they're doing it to end us they have they have cynicism
[3:23:07.440 --> 3:23:12.080]  for us and when we act like idiots and aren't informed and don't resist they say we deserve it
[3:23:12.080 --> 3:23:16.800]  so that's why what we're doing is key metaphysically we'll be right back on the other side with all
[3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:32.720]  of my great guests in studio stay with us
[3:23:32.720 --> 3:23:53.360]  morning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover

[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:30.080]  and claim that only a new lockdown will stop covid then of course when that new lockdown
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:34.400]  doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and
[3:24:34.400 --> 3:24:39.360]  that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year this is a permanent

[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:04.880]  the death incredible they're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing
[3:26:04.880 --> 3:26:10.400]  the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation not the covid virus that is a fact
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:16.080]  and all the hero's sheep where the mass could go along with this are signing on to mass murder
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:21.680]  bigger than what hitler did that's when we got the geneva convention and the nuremberg code this

[3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:52.240]  greatly set you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:26:58.240]  so
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:08.640]  so we've got quite the crew here with ali alexander nick pointe's jay dyer
[3:27:08.640 --> 3:27:14.560]  here's truly alex jones and we're streaming out on ali's periscope right now so so let's get into
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:17.680]  the meat potatoes you guys didn't see the press conference you got a lot of feedback but just
[3:27:17.680 --> 3:27:22.960]  overall the victories recap starting with nick pointe's i mean the good news coming out i mean
[3:27:22.960 --> 3:27:26.400]  because the more we fight the more we prove the fraud we're supposed to just give up and not
[3:27:26.400 --> 3:27:31.520]  investigate we know the frauds there are thousands of affidavits eyewitnesses all the veritas videos
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:36.160]  the left starting to really get that pucker factor because all their previous frauds have failed
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:42.160]  yeah well bill crystal tweeted earlier at this afternoon he said i'm alarmed so that was actually
[3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:47.520]  a really good feeling and and he's nervous because in each state state by state we're getting really
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:52.160]  good news like last night for example and i think it was yesterday evening yesterday night
[3:27:52.880 --> 3:27:58.160]  in wane county in michigan which is so important all these votes are coming in in detroit for
[3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:03.680]  joe biden almost his entire lead in michigan is contained in detroit specifically and a lot of
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:10.240]  that is in wane county a couple of days ago they initially wanted to resist certifying the results
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:15.360]  from wane county because of all the fraud going on to detroit eventually they relented because the
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:19.760]  republicans that were on the committee were receiving death threats and being harassed
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:25.520]  we got the word yesterday or might have been earlier today that they rescinded their certification
[3:28:25.520 --> 3:28:30.320]  of the results in wane county the meaning basically that joe biden's margin in detroit
[3:28:30.320 --> 3:28:35.680]  is basically in question now if they'll certify those results either way it stalls the process
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:40.080]  which is a win for us additionally in the press conference i didn't see the whole thing but i saw
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:45.600]  that rudy juliani said that they have enough provably illegitimate votes that it would flip
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:50.480]  the election and that is a huge deal because rudy juliani is the main and maybe one of the only
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:55.600]  lawyers working out of the whole trump team on this i've heard some news from the campaign that's
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:29:00.080]  not so good i guess there are some people that are giving up on the inside but rudy juliani has
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:05.120]  come out and said that we have the proof oh let's be clear sunshine page rates they're all looking
[3:29:05.120 --> 3:29:10.240]  for the next job oh absolutely and i'm so glad that john macinty is working in the white house
[3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:15.280]  he's the head of their ppo this guy is a real patriot he said the lady that won't allow the
[3:29:15.280 --> 3:29:21.760]  transfer uh yeah that's right yeah yeah and macinty said if you're looking for another job
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:25.200]  you're fired and that's how it should be that's how it should have been from the beginning
[3:29:25.200 --> 3:29:29.120]  they should have kept the people from the trump campaign and put him in the white house a lot of
[3:29:29.120 --> 3:29:34.480]  the problem is they filled it up with republican committee people and rubio alum and so on today
[3:29:34.480 --> 3:29:40.880]  60 days 59 days my god countdown is incredible it's moving very rapidly yeah and we're we're
[3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:45.760]  getting very close i think the good thing is and this is maybe the most encouraging fact is if we
[3:29:45.760 --> 3:29:50.880]  pull this off can you imagine how pissed off president trump will be when he gets inaugurated
[3:29:50.880 --> 3:29:56.320]  and at all the right people he'll have a white house full of loyalists no more games no games
[3:29:56.320 --> 3:30:03.520]  no saboteurs no fakers no sunshine gop people it will turn into the permanent revolution that
[3:30:03.520 --> 3:30:08.960]  will turn into the war presidency that it should have been in 2016 overseas awarding a republic
[3:30:08.960 --> 3:30:14.000]  back that's right yeah not a war in iraq or in afghanistan a war right here and specifically in
[3:30:14.000 --> 3:30:20.320]  dc against the swamp all you take on this uh what do you want me to answer well go back
[3:30:20.320 --> 3:30:25.120]  through people turn in all the time about the big wins that are happening in georgia in michigan
[3:30:25.120 --> 3:30:32.800]  some big stuff's going down so in wisconsin uh today uh two republicans uh decided on the uh
[3:30:32.800 --> 3:30:38.880]  on the elections board to not certify the election so wisconsin is holding its own um late late last
[3:30:38.880 --> 3:30:47.120]  night the two original dissenters in wane county decided that uh they they did pass a vote for a
[3:30:47.120 --> 3:30:52.400]  conditional certification they're now retracting that that that and saying we were under duress we
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:58.800]  were threatened and they do have 24 7 security so that's all taken care of folks we got good
[3:30:58.800 --> 3:31:03.840]  patriots watching over any brave patriot who's in the system and wants to follow the phone you're
[3:31:03.840 --> 3:31:08.000]  trying to get him security and all that so this this is all just grassroots doing it all folks yeah
[3:31:08.000 --> 3:31:14.000]  well you know uh i'm not going to take credit publicly but uh thank you and um and so if we
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:18.960]  keep that certifications at the county level then the michigan secretary of state cannot
[3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:25.200]  certify she is a b word and she is a democrat and so that's good because then it makes the
[3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:30.560]  michigan state houses say well we need to take our proper and constitutional role here in georgia
[3:31:30.560 --> 3:31:34.560]  we're waiting for governor there's a bunch of followers in the legislations we have to be the
[3:31:34.560 --> 3:31:40.800]  leaders right and here in georgia uh we're petitioning the governor to call a special session that is
[3:31:40.800 --> 3:31:46.720]  the chant that we are using here and what i got last night was a flurry dozens of members of the
[3:31:46.720 --> 3:31:51.200]  state house and state senate were texting each other saying oh my gosh do we need to come in
[3:31:51.200 --> 3:31:55.760]  our careers could go down with brats and down with brands so that was good i used to live here for
[3:31:55.760 --> 3:32:00.400]  three years so we've got our our ear to the ground and again that vernon jones guy's amazing he's
[3:32:00.400 --> 3:32:05.040]  been a democrat he's now a republicans he has a great speech yesterday so so we heard days ago
[3:32:05.040 --> 3:32:09.200]  the governor's gonna make this announcement internally what is the announcement the the
[3:32:09.200 --> 3:32:13.920]  announcement should have been yesterday so this is either really i was telling alexis uh yesterday
[3:32:13.920 --> 3:32:18.080]  this is either really good or i was telling roger this this is either really good news
[3:32:18.080 --> 3:32:21.840]  because it means that we've actually made him have more of a spine he was already going to
[3:32:21.840 --> 3:32:26.000]  come our way a little bit but now he might have to come our way all the way or it's really bad
[3:32:26.000 --> 3:32:32.080]  and he's going to just dig his nasty heels in but i told him primary or special session you
[3:32:32.080 --> 3:32:37.760]  choose jay i have a question for you with it all the way down the line here if just to the nutshell
[3:32:37.760 --> 3:32:44.160]  if they're able to put their little crypt keeper puppet creature in there what does that do to america
[3:32:44.160 --> 3:32:52.560]  just just halt versus if we prove it's a fraud and put trump in then they go really crazy right so
[3:32:52.560 --> 3:32:59.440]  one thing that reminded me of uh if you remember you know quigley biden uh clinton that nexus is
[3:32:59.440 --> 3:33:05.840]  all about the third way and the third way idea was to merge the west and its capitalism with the
[3:33:05.840 --> 3:33:10.640]  communism of eurasia to have this synthesis that they called the third way and that was something
[3:33:10.640 --> 3:33:16.080]  that uh uh clinton was a big proponent of and and you've got you're getting i think with biden
[3:33:16.080 --> 3:33:21.520]  that that nexus that uh that merging that's the admitted plan yes i wish they tell the
[3:33:21.520 --> 3:33:26.320]  minions oh we're gonna merge capitalism we really just all pick up slice well if if that's if biden
[3:33:26.320 --> 3:33:32.240]  is in that's the track that we're gonna take um if if it's reversed and if trump is elected uh
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:36.720]  which i think he was i think he won i don't think there's any question about it i think it's so
[3:33:36.720 --> 3:33:41.040]  obvious that there was so much wrong i mean the mere fact that they stopped the states
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:46.880]  they stopped count has ever happened before you're stopping no it's incredibly obvious
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:50.240]  preposterous and had it all the states do it together it was coordinated exactly it was coordinated
[3:33:50.240 --> 3:33:56.320]  it had to be coordinated and so that means that what we will get is a i mean people are gonna write
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:34:02.080]  in the streets now i would rather face people mad in the streets with trump elected than a global
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:07.280]  economy takeover and endless lockdown i agree but but think about that it's the key is juliani said
[3:34:07.280 --> 3:34:13.200]  it's all coordinated i think you're doing a great job look at that all those five states at the same
[3:34:13.200 --> 3:34:19.600]  time shut down and stop counting but then secretly kept counting that jen are you getting more well
[3:34:19.600 --> 3:34:23.840]  how would they say how could they say that there's no evidence of fraud when that is the most obvious
[3:34:23.840 --> 3:34:31.280]  fact of of fraud and chicane yeah who made that call it's ludicrous yeah look folks what this is
[3:34:31.280 --> 3:34:37.040]  what i think has been missing from from people well you know fox news forget them but what
[3:34:37.040 --> 3:34:42.480]  tucker carlson's show should be is to get a political science up there for an hour and describe
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:49.360]  demographics because people like me are dying to tell the public you can't win florida and ohio by
[3:34:49.360 --> 3:34:54.800]  larger margins and then suddenly lose white people in the rust belt where trump is strong i know they
[3:34:54.800 --> 3:35:00.560]  stole what's not i know oh and then that blacks hispanics and women but not white men because those
[3:35:00.560 --> 3:35:06.480]  white men are dead folks yeah well there's a lot of that and then there's a white news or voting
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:11.840]  biden in right right so remember if you guys don't remember the headlines trump loses seniors
[3:35:11.840 --> 3:35:17.920]  co vid response inadequate well then why weren't we 20 points behind in florida we were never going
[3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:22.160]  to lose florida trump won all those states with bigger margins was winning the disputed ones
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:26.720]  with bigger margins till they shut it down right and so people like me who have worked a hundred
[3:35:26.720 --> 3:35:32.400]  federal campaigns want to say south carolina's first congressional district arizona and florida
[3:35:32.400 --> 3:35:37.440]  will tell you what white retirees are doing and we knew that they weren't abandoning us we know
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:42.400]  that we had a small dip in them but we knew we weren't losing them i don't know what you're
[3:35:42.400 --> 3:35:49.680]  watching a nascar race and there's a car a whole lap ahead they turn the lights off for five minutes
[3:35:49.680 --> 3:35:53.760]  and that car's crashed and the other cars are out of it you're like you're like this is a fraud
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:36:01.280]  it's a scam it's a total scam well and what's amazing if you pointed this out a moment ago
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:06.400]  they literally i think you pointed out to just stop counting the votes and it just so happened to
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:11.680]  occur in literally every single swing state and i remember because i did marathon coverage of the
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:16.800]  election and at a certain point they said well the people counting the ballots in pennsylvania
[3:36:16.800 --> 3:36:21.120]  are going home because they're tired really it's election night and they're tired and they're going
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:26.240]  home in some states they were saying i think in nevada well it's taking much longer to count
[3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:32.400]  the waterman's burst too oh that's right yeah in atlanta well the water main burst it only took
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:37.920]  them two hours to repair yeah it took them two hours to repair but they had to resume counting
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:44.640]  the votes 24 hours later it took them 24 hours to be counted again that's right in cnn center
[3:36:44.640 --> 3:36:50.560]  and this most of the world submitted the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by
[3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:55.760]  the communist chinese and the united nations and now because the slaves have proven themselves to
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:37:01.440]  be subservient the worst australian models of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your house
[3:37:01.440 --> 3:37:06.640]  for months and months are being announced and in germany the police are using giant armored
[3:37:06.640 --> 3:37:11.760]  tanks with water cannons to blast men women and children that protest the fact that merkel the
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:17.360]  dictator has put them under her control that's right she's been rigging elections for years and years
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:22.560]  and the same thing is coming here to the united states this is world government in philadelphia
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:27.760]  they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested they're announcing the christmas
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:33.040]  is cancelled this is what the communist takeover looks like to bankrupt you to take rid of all your

[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:57.840]  if there's a red mirage we believe it's gonna look like trumps gonna win a landslide because they
[3:37:57.840 --> 3:38:03.840]  had the internal polls and indeed trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:10.640]  margin and when he was set to win the other ones they froze these seven states on election night
[3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:14.320]  and then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had this is completely transparent
[3:38:14.320 --> 3:38:19.120]  so when they say that he is president elect he's not trump is not conceded none of the states have
[3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:23.920]  certified the vote and now all these investigations have been opened up and avalanches mountains
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:30.080]  oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented in georgia officials are on

[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:10.080]  here we go take me live
[3:41:12.480 --> 3:41:17.920]  all right ollie alexander is bouncing off the wall so am i we got j dire of course we've
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:21.760]  got nick pointe so closing comments from all you guys want to appreciate on the show today
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:24.960]  we're about to get in the car in a little wall and drive up the governor's mansion here in
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:31.120]  Atlanta crazy things happening who's the star first i'll start first i'm high energy i'm excited
[3:41:31.120 --> 3:41:36.640]  i feel activated we've been watching this happen for years and now we're making it happen now
[3:41:36.640 --> 3:41:41.040]  we're making history happen right now and i don't think there's any better feeling than
[3:41:41.040 --> 3:41:46.560]  this unifying mindset that we're all working towards the same objective and we're all leaving
[3:41:46.560 --> 3:41:52.000]  it all on the line and there's something kind of incredible about seeing that and also our
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:57.600]  followers and fans are doing the same it's a real unifying moment people coming together
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:02.400]  in the great struggle that we all knew i think we all knew was going to happen eventually
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:06.240]  we've been watching them the globalists are making their play and now we're making our
[3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:11.200]  play too it was their turn for a long time and now it's our turn so i'm feeling really good
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:14.880]  but of course we got to keep our foot on the gas and keep it going all the way through the
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:19.840]  inauguration maybe even afterwards but i think that this is maybe the best outcome that could
[3:42:19.840 --> 3:42:23.760]  have happened we are really delegitimizing the system and we're galvanizing the people
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:31.360]  i think this is great uh i'm really um i i'm emboldened by what i've seen today i the speeches
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:36.160]  were great i i now i understand alex's voice because i actually lost mine screaming i've
[3:42:36.160 --> 3:42:41.520]  never had that happen before but now i understand the voice um but you know nick motivated me ally
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:47.520]  motivated me this is great i think that that the elite are going to lose and they're going to lose
[3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:52.480]  because god is in charge and we know the end of the story we've been told you know in the scriptures
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:57.040]  what's going to happen we know that the elite uh serving basically satan and they're not going to
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:02.960]  win uh we know that christ is already pretty much won uh and so now we're just waiting for that final
[3:43:02.960 --> 3:43:07.680]  victory and so i'm not worried about you know the day-to-day uh i think that we do have to get out
[3:43:07.680 --> 3:43:12.240]  there and fight we don't want to accept christ it's not the fake church christ the real one that's
[3:43:12.240 --> 3:43:16.560]  inside of us we have to accept that we were to give it the victory but we have to accept the victory
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:23.440]  and act on it exactly yeah yeah well you just stole my line i was gonna say uh you know faith
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:29.200]  without works is dead and so you know i i love what michelle malkin said in colorado springs
[3:43:29.200 --> 3:43:34.400]  i think a couple of weeks ago what will you be able to say to the next generation of slaves
[3:43:34.400 --> 3:43:41.680]  that you did now will you say oh i had to keep my job i was worried about tweeting or retweeting
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:46.160]  or posting something on facebook i couldn't have someone see my face i'm worried about my safety
[3:43:46.160 --> 3:43:53.040]  oh do you guys have a wheelchair ramp you have to fight back you have to stop you're in action green
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:44:02.320]  lit slavery exactly this it was incrementalism and an action that gave us this false sense of
[3:44:02.320 --> 3:44:07.200]  decadence and it's all a lie it's all a lie so we're all going to be prepared for whatever comes
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:14.960]  next it's going to be not so hot but it's better than slavery so stop the steel to end the lockdowns
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:19.600]  or enjoy your pod and your tie pod meals that's right we've still got quite a bit of time left
[3:44:19.600 --> 3:44:25.360]  here um what's coming up next tomorrow um what's the next big battle first let's you're the strategist
[3:44:25.360 --> 3:44:28.960]  i know a little bit strategy too but what's the next big battle now that they view this big press
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:33.360]  conference they've put forward the evidence we got to put it in the courts uh you know i saw a quote
[3:44:33.360 --> 3:44:40.160]  where uh uh uh sydney pal and rudy juliani said we have time my message uh to them privately and
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:45.120]  i've said it publicly and i'll say it publicly again is do not underestimate that federal judges
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:50.640]  and even supreme court justices are still human which is why we will have protests in dc when
[3:44:50.640 --> 3:44:55.600]  they're at the supreme court i'll be at the supreme supreme court i know nick will be there i know
[3:44:55.600 --> 3:44:59.360]  we'll get alex there maybe jay will be there but we'll be at the supreme court when they're at the
[3:44:59.360 --> 3:45:05.520]  supreme court do not underestimate that the system will try to protect itself it's lies it's it's
[3:45:05.520 --> 3:45:10.160]  feral if we understand trump was an interloper he came in from outside right he came in from outside
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:15.200]  because remember they do all this polling and media conditioning and pro and programming to say
[3:45:15.200 --> 3:45:19.840]  well what is a convincing lie so when trump came from behind it was because they didn't have access
[3:45:19.840 --> 3:45:24.720]  to his internal polling he wasn't even doing that much so what we have to understand is we've got to
[3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:30.080]  now break the entire system you've got to cancel your netflix cancel your your tv package grow
[3:45:30.080 --> 3:45:35.360]  your tv on the side of the road and let everyone see that it's broken we need great acts brave
[3:45:35.360 --> 3:45:40.800]  acts of humanity yeah we need great acts of humanity right now so that we know that we are
[3:45:41.840 --> 3:45:47.200]  jay we're 73 million i actually think we're 80 million strong they took away trump's votes
[3:45:47.200 --> 3:45:51.840]  and they took away trump's votes we are 80 million strong this country is united people wake up around
[3:45:51.840 --> 3:45:57.280]  the world yeah all in with this but the country is united and it's peaceful they want us at war
[3:45:57.280 --> 3:46:00.560]  and if they want one we're going to give it to them we're not going to do it to our fellow
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:06.880]  neighbors so we got to have great acts of unity closing comments from you guys go ahead i i agree
[3:46:06.880 --> 3:46:11.440]  with everything you just said and that's exactly it we have to follow this fight for as long as
[3:46:11.440 --> 3:46:16.240]  it's going on whether it's in the courts or the state capitals there's a lot of procedure ahead of
[3:46:16.240 --> 3:46:21.280]  us the question at this point is what trajectory we're going to go along there are many different
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:26.240]  routes but it all has to have the same ultimate conclusion no matter what the playbook is the
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:32.160]  same resist exactly resist turnout we have to file them everywhere and you're exactly right
[3:46:32.160 --> 3:46:37.840]  that the system protects itself that is the most critical thing people have faith i think implicitly
[3:46:37.840 --> 3:46:43.280]  in the system specifically in the courts the system becomes a cancer it wants to destroy you it must
[3:46:43.280 --> 3:46:48.720]  be defeated yes specifically the right keeps saying the courts will save us the supreme court
[3:46:48.720 --> 3:46:54.720]  let's do it all protest courts state legislature everything well and people think that because
[3:46:54.720 --> 3:47:00.880]  there is a judge presiding over a court there's this idea that will a judge is a political it is
[3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:06.000]  all political and judges are just as political as congressmen or governors or anybody else
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:10.320]  exactly well and even the secretary of state in georgia is he's supposed to be above partisan
[3:47:10.320 --> 3:47:16.240]  politics that it totally controlled and the supreme court too in pennsylvania partially
[3:47:16.240 --> 3:47:22.080]  we're in this mess because a cb sat out the ruling when it came to the rule change they made about
[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:26.960]  extending the deadline for receiving the mail-in ballots so i don't know we saw a lot of bad supreme
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:32.400]  court decisions come down this summer we have to be out there we have to occupy it's not a given
[3:47:32.400 --> 3:47:37.680]  when it comes to the left and left-wing causes they're out no matter what it's not a redundancy
[3:47:37.680 --> 3:47:41.840]  and if we weren't out there at the state capitol people wouldn't be out at the state capitol today
[3:47:41.840 --> 3:47:47.280]  that's unbelievable leaders have to do it one becomes five five becomes ten ten becomes a hundred
[3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:52.560]  then becomes a thousand it just goes on and on we have to do it because the globalists think
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:56.960]  we're these programmable creatures that just do what we're told then we have to be outside the box
[3:47:57.520 --> 3:48:00.560]  jay dire we're almost out of time what do you think about this historic moment right now
[3:48:00.560 --> 3:48:06.400]  no this is amazing i would like to add that a lot of people come under the impression from
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:10.240]  being beaten down by the media being beaten down in these these brainwashing camps called
[3:48:10.240 --> 3:48:15.120]  schools that you can't do anything that you're worthless you're guilty for who you are for
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:21.760]  just existing and it's all lies you can take action everybody can make a difference and it's not the
[3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:26.160]  case that just because you you went through all this nonsense you can't take it you can't take
[3:48:26.160 --> 3:48:30.880]  action and change things i think there's a there's a huge there's a misuse of human potential that's
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:35.920]  this new age nonsense but there really is human potential and if people get activated motivated
[3:48:35.920 --> 3:48:41.920]  take action it it won't this is all about us programmable we get outside the box it's over
[3:48:41.920 --> 3:48:49.360]  right it's true and people can rise up we have the power to do that people think that
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:54.160]  because of the institutions that are against us that we don't stand a chance and jay are exactly
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:48:58.960]  right they've lead us to believe that we have no power the power is in our hands it's up to us to
[3:48:58.960 --> 3:49:04.800]  break the mental shackle this audience knows that they just have to continue to stay engaged knowing
[3:49:04.800 --> 3:49:08.800]  it's just going to get crazier from here and everything you do in the future will only make
[3:49:08.800 --> 3:49:13.440]  you stronger resisting this those that give into it are just grounded and destroyed you're all
[3:49:13.440 --> 3:49:18.800]  going to become leaders in this fight as things become more intense ollie yeah i mean oh we keep
[3:49:18.800 --> 3:49:24.640]  passing him now i'm on my third closing but you know it's you you guys can be heroes you guys can

[3:49:41.520 --> 3:49:46.000]  going to be a slave and it's not that the virus is a hoax because they have weaponized something
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:50.640]  against us it's that the mismanagement right if they're great central planners and they want us
[3:49:50.640 --> 3:49:56.080]  to walk into this new system can we trust someone who managed covet this way or mismanaged covet
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:50:01.520]  this way lie about it all exaggerated yeah so they can go to hell by themselves and without us
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:06.560]  and our duty is to resist so that they wait so about 15 minutes we're getting in the cars
