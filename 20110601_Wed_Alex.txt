[00:19.300 --> 00:45.480]  Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome it is Wednesday the first day of
[00:45.480 --> 00:52.580]  June 2011 we're going to be live here for the next three hours at least and
[00:52.580 --> 00:58.560]  obviously there is masses of very important news and information on the
[00:58.560 --> 01:04.100]  geopolitical military front on the economic front on the free speech
[01:04.100 --> 01:10.860]  front here in the United States with judge bans prayer at Texas graduation
[01:10.860 --> 01:16.280]  notice first they say they can't have a prayer officially sanctioned by the
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.840]  school before the football game then it turns into now you can't bring a Bible
[01:22.840 --> 01:30.640]  to school you can't say if you're the valovictorian or the salutatorian thank
[01:30.640 --> 01:35.120]  God you know for guiding me to stay straight and strong in school you don't
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.040]  talk now if you want to get up there and thank Buddha that's fine if you want to
[01:40.040 --> 01:44.840]  get there and think Chaitan it's fine if you want to get up there and thank the

[01:48.320 --> 01:56.960]  or Barack Obama George Bush if you want to get up there and talk about now you
[01:56.960 --> 02:05.920]  like eating M&Ms that's okay any speech but Christian speech and that's where we
[02:05.920 --> 02:10.280]  see this discrimination you can have minorities up all over the country you
[02:10.280 --> 02:16.000]  can have Kwanzaa day you can have whatever other group but don't have a
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.800]  city put up any type of even Christmas tree which really isn't even religious
[02:22.800 --> 02:28.840]  it it's not Christian it goes back to the Druids but it's more just festive
[02:28.840 --> 02:36.520]  can't have that either you can't have anything involved with Christmas because
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.800]  it's a full-on assault to attack only certain types of speech we're gonna be
[02:40.800 --> 02:46.080]  talking about that some today the latest big news on Fukushima as well
[02:46.080 --> 02:52.360]  Japanese seniors volunteer for Fukushima Suicide Corps or basically
[02:52.360 --> 03:00.880]  kamikazes as they're being called the divine wind we've also got reports of
[03:00.880 --> 03:09.480]  riots breaking out all over the US at theme parks at beaches and can you
[03:09.480 --> 03:14.000]  imagine these news reports are pointing out that it's a lot of
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.200]  disadvantaged urban crowds that's code word for black people and that this is
[03:20.200 --> 03:24.520]  going on and I want to look at why this is going on and historically why this
[03:24.520 --> 03:30.200]  is happening and the fact that now upwards of 50 million Americans are on
[03:30.200 --> 03:34.600]  food stamps black white you name it and and and where we're going with these
[03:34.600 --> 03:41.720]  dependent groups within groups and the entitlement attitude you get from
[03:41.720 --> 03:50.160]  groups that have a victimology psychology and then basically go and team up
[03:50.160 --> 03:53.920]  with the federal government to be their protector they're they're not being
[03:53.920 --> 04:03.280]  protected they're being basically turned into a group of people who have 90 plus
[04:03.280 --> 04:09.000]  percent illegitimacy in the home which on average increases crime statistically
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.960]  your chances of ending up in prison fourfold and we wonder why we have such
[04:12.960 --> 04:17.400]  a large population of black folks in this country in prison so I'm gonna look
[04:17.400 --> 04:22.160]  at this today and talk about it because it is going on and I'm gonna discuss it
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.320]  because I care about all these quote ethnic groups and organizations and
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.800]  people need to be honest with themselves to reverse or even stop the
[04:31.800 --> 04:39.080]  downward spiral and slide so we're gonna be discussing that as well big broadcast

[11:21.240 --> 11:25.680]  hitting you with high-powered radiation to pick up your brainwaves and I would
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.600]  read the CBS News report it was one report about it and later I've mentioned
[11:30.600 --> 11:34.120]  on radio shows years later people would laugh at me oh yeah they got brain
[11:34.120 --> 11:37.920]  readers at the airports yes they've already been testing it now they've
[11:37.920 --> 11:40.880]  announced they are going to purchase what they've been testing the last few
[11:40.880 --> 11:44.320]  years these big mobile trucks we played the Homeland Security's own press

[11:58.880 --> 12:04.480]  they're quackery lie detector tests have been proven to be a fraud hundreds of
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.000]  thousands of innocent people conservatively sent to prison with them so
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  now they've just got new fancy machines it's kind of like Enron got caught what
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.800]  seven eight years ago now putting up fake computer programs showing the energy
[12:21.800 --> 12:26.160]  trading going when they would march California Texas and other state
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.280]  legislators through their their control systems in Texas and California at the
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.240]  time they would march Congress people through and say see this is why the
[12:34.240 --> 12:39.160]  prices have tripled this week you see the trading it's all free market all fake
[12:39.160 --> 12:44.560]  well now they just have a fake Robbie the robot thing with blinking lights and
[12:44.560 --> 12:49.120]  say it shows you're a lighted you know put a tinfoil cap on you with a light bulb
[12:49.120 --> 12:55.040]  on the top and oh the light bulb says you're lying off the prison for you
[12:56.040 --> 13:00.920]  I'll do a skit on that but a tinfoil hat on somebody with a light bulb you know
[13:00.920 --> 13:08.560]  did you murder JFK and they say no I didn't know up the light bulb lit up you
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.760]  you murdered JFK and have a 10-year-old in the seat impossible for him to kill
[13:12.760 --> 13:18.440]  JFK more than 40 years ago oh but the computer a computer says so just
[13:18.440 --> 13:25.560]  absolute baloney so we're gonna be going over some of that today also great
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.880]  report out of the American dream website up at info wars comm 18 signs that
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.920]  life in US public schools is now equivalent to life in US prisons I'm glad
[13:35.920 --> 13:40.040]  that folks are beginning to pick up on that fact and it's becoming more and
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.680]  more widely reported also Kurt Nemo has a key report fed ready to print more
[13:45.680 --> 13:51.400]  funny money QE three rumors CNBC is reporting that that is indeed what's
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.360]  happening well they've announced I mean the Chinese are dumping the dollar
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.680]  quicker than you drop an old shoe and they say they're gonna cut back on the
[14:00.680 --> 14:04.520]  issuance of the Federal Reserve buying it's a the federal government's Treasury
[14:04.520 --> 14:10.360]  bills but if they do that it will only make the depression that much more
[14:10.360 --> 14:15.440]  obvious and won't transfer more power to the offshore banks so they're going to
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.360]  continue that as Bob Chapman dr. Paul Craig Roberts and many other economists
[14:20.360 --> 14:24.800]  have pointed out because they don't have a choice it gives them more power they
[14:24.800 --> 14:29.080]  get first use of the money when it still has value then you pay for it via
[14:29.080 --> 14:35.520]  national debt and it makes the crash gradual which is what these parasites
[14:35.520 --> 14:40.680]  always do so we're going to be going over those reports as well in fact here
[14:40.680 --> 14:45.400]  it is and CNBC prepare for more money printing investors to prepare themselves
[14:45.400 --> 14:52.160]  for a third round of quantitative easing said Simon McGon co-head of European
[14:52.160 --> 14:58.160]  equities MF global told CNBC today the bond market is going in one direction
[14:58.160 --> 15:05.400]  which is up falling yields which is telling you quite clearly the direction
[15:05.400 --> 15:10.720]  of economic travel is downwards downgrades QE 3 a third round of
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.240]  quantitative easing is coming the bond markets are all smarter than us and
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.000]  that's exactly what the bond markets are telling me yeah all the insiders know
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.040]  they're gonna continue it so that's continuing that trend the bond market is
[15:25.040 --> 15:32.280]  going in one direction which is up what interesting and investing in the bond
[15:32.280 --> 15:39.000]  markets over the last couple of sessions is you're seeing human traders trying to
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  step in and call this turn in the market the same way the equities have done and
[15:44.000 --> 15:52.320]  they have just been mowed down by the quant funds which are all about
[15:52.320 --> 15:58.200]  leverage all about momentum and are betting on bond prices going up that
[15:58.200 --> 16:01.760]  sounded kind of babbly it's because it's a transcript of what he said once
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.440]  again the United States will step up as the marginal buyer of bonds which means
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.480]  monetizing the debt he went on to say one big injection of cash in the bond
[16:12.480 --> 16:16.520]  market should take you through at least the summer session in the beginning of
[16:16.520 --> 16:22.440]  the fourth quarter the cash injection will have normal inflationary knock-on
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.720]  impact driving backup commodities supporting industrial stocks dragging
[16:27.720 --> 16:33.160]  the financials up with them I think it's about the monetary injection trade he
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.200]  told CNBC well of course see they announced a month ago that they were
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.200]  going to stop having quantitative easing IE monetization of debt turning up the
[16:43.200 --> 16:49.440]  printing presses to put it in layman's terms and so along with that and margin
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.760]  calls the amount being raised that you have to have to be able to naked short
[16:55.760 --> 17:00.400]  silver or gold that basically with the announcement that they were going to
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.680]  cut back on monetization of debt which will drive down commodities made gold
[17:04.680 --> 17:10.120]  and silver go down for a time but as this new wave of QE3 hits and we know
[17:10.120 --> 17:13.560]  they're already into QE3 despite the fact Bernanke said they weren't going to
[17:13.560 --> 17:19.080]  because it's on record that the private Federal Reserve is buying more than 70
[17:19.080 --> 17:24.720]  percent of the new Treasury bills that are being issued as China and Europe and
[17:24.720 --> 17:30.400]  the Japanese and the Arabs and private investors and big mega banks run from
[17:30.400 --> 17:35.080]  US Treasuries the Federal Reserve is going in and buying them but that's
[17:35.080 --> 17:40.240]  backed up with your tax money so understand this we will pay interest on
[17:40.240 --> 17:45.880]  debt to the Federal Reserve on money they get first use of they get the money
[17:45.880 --> 17:50.360]  they give it to their member banks at near zero percent they loan it to you at
[17:50.360 --> 17:58.480]  10 20 30 40 50 60 in some cases upwards of 70 plus percent and then you pay
[17:58.480 --> 18:04.800]  interest on that via taxes boy you've it's hard to even describe a scam that
[18:04.800 --> 18:14.640]  out in the open it's so brazen so naked that I it beggars the mind to even be

[24:10.120 --> 24:14.880]  okay if you look at what's happened in Europe what's happened in Canada
[24:14.880 --> 24:20.680]  Australia New Zealand the United States it's a continuity of agenda cell phones
[24:20.680 --> 24:27.080]  under regulations having tracker surveillance chips put into them under
[24:27.080 --> 24:32.160]  government orders it's done in the entire western world standardized attacks on
[24:32.160 --> 24:37.720]  free speech and the ways governments roll out these attacks on free speech is
[24:37.720 --> 24:45.920]  a shake and bake it's like going and getting boxed mix for pancakes it's got
[24:45.920 --> 24:49.760]  the same ingredients so whether you're making pancakes in New Zealand or
[24:49.760 --> 24:54.920]  Austin Texas it's done the same way and they have global think tanks that write
[24:54.920 --> 25:00.360]  the prospectus that write the codes then the major corporations put the systems
[25:00.360 --> 25:07.360]  in place and then pass the cost on to you my point by prefacing this next
[25:07.360 --> 25:14.040]  article with that is all of this is systematically designed we can look at
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.400]  it and see it's designed but you can also study it and see where the social
[25:18.400 --> 25:23.320]  engineers have designed it and the social engineers have also used the
[25:23.320 --> 25:29.200]  controlled corporate media the dramas the sitcoms the fiction the nonfiction to
[25:29.200 --> 25:36.640]  make it a joke that on these programs that if you question the system if you
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.880]  question the rat maze if you question the designers of the modern
[25:41.880 --> 25:48.480]  civilization that are overriding our normal human system you're a conspiracy
[25:48.480 --> 25:54.520]  theorist questioning is a conspiracy theory reading ran corporation
[25:54.520 --> 25:58.360]  documents reading you in documents reading council on foreign relations
[25:58.360 --> 26:06.800]  documents being informed is bad and is crazy and I liken it to Mike judges
[26:06.800 --> 26:14.640]  excellent film idiocracy where a guy is in the army it's a comedy and gets put
[26:14.640 --> 26:24.960]  on you know life suspension system basically frozen and suspended animation
[26:24.960 --> 26:32.000]  for 300 years and he wakes up and in his day he was he was a moron but a couple
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.200]  hundred years in the future he's a genius because he's actually able to even
[26:36.200 --> 26:42.840]  talk in full sentences and and and and people laugh at him they think he's
[26:42.840 --> 26:49.040]  showing off the whole future is a police state and he gets called into court
[26:49.040 --> 26:52.960]  and he tries to stand up and defend himself because his lawyer is saying
[26:52.960 --> 26:56.440]  that he's guilty and he goes wait you're my lawyer and so he start trying to
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.320]  defend himself and the judge says oh look you think you're fancy you think
[27:00.320 --> 27:11.000]  we're smart we're gonna lock you up and I digress the issue here is there is a
[27:11.000 --> 27:18.920]  specific rollout plan to completely ban free speech under political correctness
[27:18.920 --> 27:26.160]  that is now in full swing all over the Western world it has nothing to do with
[27:26.160 --> 27:29.360]  being liberal nothing to do with people's rights nothing to do with
[27:29.360 --> 27:36.360]  trendiness that's the cover story it's about global standardization for attacks
[27:36.360 --> 27:43.120]  on free speech and because Europe is five six seven years depending on what
[27:43.120 --> 27:49.400]  country ahead of us with this we know what to look for here and we can follow
[27:49.400 --> 27:54.840]  it on a roadmap there are some areas of the social engineering and the dumbing
[27:54.840 --> 28:00.920]  down of society and the tattletale system that we in the United States are
[28:00.920 --> 28:11.960]  ahead of Europe on and there's so many complexities to simplify it Europe after
[28:11.960 --> 28:17.600]  World War two all over Europe passed laws saying there is no Nazi party
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.160]  allowed because we just had a war with the Nazis
[28:21.160 --> 28:27.000]  sounded reasonable on the surface but it set a precedent to where they could
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.840]  ban political organizations and groups now everybody can be affected then okay
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.640]  not just if you're a Nazi no white supremacist organizations people said
[28:36.640 --> 28:41.080]  sounds reasonable if you credit an organization or get involved you get
[28:41.080 --> 28:47.120]  arrested long-presence sentences automatic go to jail then well we
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.840]  consider nationalistic parties people that want sovereignty people that want
[28:52.840 --> 28:59.440]  to keep their culture that's now racist so that's banned oh you're a member of
[28:59.440 --> 29:04.840]  a government's parliament you criticized Muslims firebombing things because of
[29:04.840 --> 29:10.440]  the Muhammad cartoons you're gonna go to jail and those people are now in trial
[29:10.440 --> 29:18.680]  and going to jail oh you're an American that has had an alternative view of
[29:18.680 --> 29:26.280]  history you fly to Germany Germany arrest you put you in jail now that's
[29:26.280 --> 29:30.800]  the point Europe's up to now that's all coming here and I want to break down
[29:30.800 --> 29:35.320]  exactly what they're going to do and and how this is being rolled out and it
[29:35.320 --> 29:40.040]  starts with judge bans prayer at Texas graduation now we've all heard that
[29:40.040 --> 29:44.800]  before the principal can't pray but now the students this is happening
[29:44.800 --> 29:55.280]  nationwide you can't thank God we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex
[29:55.280 --> 30:03.600]  Jones and the GCN radio network you've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[30:03.600 --> 30:07.280]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[30:07.280 --> 30:11.360]  silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs
[30:11.360 --> 30:14.840]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[30:14.840 --> 30:19.640]  in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the
[30:19.640 --> 30:23.880]  Silver Lungs generator not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless
[30:23.880 --> 30:28.000]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[30:28.000 --> 30:32.480]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[30:32.480 --> 30:39.680]  key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin

[31:01.320 --> 31:04.680]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[31:04.680 --> 31:08.840]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[31:08.840 --> 31:13.160]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[31:13.160 --> 31:17.120]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[31:17.120 --> 31:21.480]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[31:21.480 --> 31:25.800]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[31:25.800 --> 31:29.560]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[31:29.560 --> 31:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[31:33.680 --> 31:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[31:37.400 --> 31:41.480]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[31:41.480 --> 31:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[31:44.200 --> 31:50.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[32:09.240 --> 32:15.800]  be glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's a place down in Tennessee
[32:15.800 --> 32:25.760]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans they so pride in every stitch guarantee
[32:25.760 --> 32:33.000]  you love the way they fit put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it

[33:00.760 --> 33:11.160]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[33:11.160 --> 33:32.760]  we are back live my friends I'm going to get into the way that governments in
[33:32.760 --> 33:38.000]  free speech the way our government's trying to openly overturn the First
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.840]  Amendment and again they're training the next generation to submit to all of
[33:42.840 --> 33:47.720]  this in the public schools they are several generations into it so I want
[33:47.720 --> 33:53.360]  to look at the progression of what's happened in Europe and how now it's
[33:53.360 --> 33:58.960]  being phased in here in our Republic they're not just violating the Fourth
[33:58.960 --> 34:01.880]  Amendment they're not just violating the Tenth Amendment the Second Amendment
[34:01.880 --> 34:08.400]  there is a prosecutory war against the Bill of Rights because the Bill of
[34:08.400 --> 34:15.200]  Rights bars these banking usurpers from fully dominating us our government our
[34:15.200 --> 34:19.840]  federal government has been almost completely taken over by economic
[34:19.840 --> 34:26.240]  subterfuge and warfare if you look at big corporations they routinely put spies
[34:26.240 --> 34:32.320]  into each other's organizations they routinely end wars fortune 500 are on
[34:32.320 --> 34:37.640]  record by having the son of one CEO or owner or chairman marry the daughter of
[34:37.640 --> 34:43.800]  the other organization humans always act the same it's called royalty they
[34:43.800 --> 34:48.640]  write the laws now the lobbyists do exempting the corporations from taxes
[34:48.640 --> 34:53.280]  exempting them they're allowed to traffic and narcotics launder money run
[34:53.280 --> 34:57.520]  child kidnapping rings Dinecore Halliburton Chicago Tribune don't get
[34:57.520 --> 35:02.160]  in trouble for this if you got caught doing it it's all over the news you're
[35:02.160 --> 35:05.520]  the ultimate devil and you should be but when they do it it's just a dirty
[35:05.520 --> 35:11.280]  little secret let's keep that quiet my point is the magnitude of the corruption
[35:11.280 --> 35:19.600]  going on by these systems is staggering absolutely staggering and mind blowing
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.920]  what they're able to do and they've taken our government over the same way in
[35:23.920 --> 35:30.800]  a hostile corporate takeover they got their beachhead in 1913 and now
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.720]  completely run this country but it's all done through fraud and anytime we
[35:35.720 --> 35:41.440]  collectively wake up to the fraud it could all be ended through the systems
[35:41.440 --> 35:46.800]  the founders gave us that's why like a railroad track that could lead our
[35:46.800 --> 35:51.880]  system to freedom they're tearing up that railroad track and they're building
[35:51.880 --> 35:56.000]  their police state next to it so that there's only one way to roll and that's
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  down their system they're totally rewriting reengineering the entire
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.800]  society we're very deep into this we're in the final phases of the total
[36:05.800 --> 36:09.960]  takeover and folks when you read their own Club of Rome UN documents that we've
[36:09.960 --> 36:14.800]  published republished their Rockefeller Foundation documents the Ted Turner
[36:14.800 --> 36:23.160]  quotes covered my books films it is mind boggling how evil it is once they get
[36:23.160 --> 36:27.240]  control once they've got the grid fully in control they're finishing it up
[36:27.240 --> 36:34.600]  right now it is horrible what's going to happen absolutely horrible and they're
[36:34.600 --> 36:40.520]  gonna have their politically correct police on the left and right come and
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.440]  arrest us as Cass Sunstein the White House regulations are has written in two
[36:45.440 --> 36:51.760]  public policy reports and his organizations and the groups that he's
[36:51.760 --> 36:56.000]  openly affiliated with media matters and other George Soros groups are openly
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.440]  calling for us to be arrested they're openly calling for infiltration of
[37:00.440 --> 37:07.600]  organizations and our imprisonment Politico even reported on that two months
[37:07.600 --> 37:11.520]  ago getting more of their secret documents I mean if they can get away
[37:11.520 --> 37:18.160]  with it if they can sell the public on it they're gonna do it and you need to
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.840]  understand that that this isn't hype ladies and gentlemen I do not have
[37:22.840 --> 37:32.480]  words to describe to you the full import of historically sociologically what
[37:32.480 --> 37:39.960]  we're in right now I'm just mind boggled that it could have gone this far and
[37:39.960 --> 37:45.440]  that history is repeating itself so horribly right now with this high-tech
[37:45.440 --> 37:51.680]  overlay and I'm gonna cover that more later to who list cell phones as cancer
[37:51.680 --> 37:56.320]  hazard they're telling you that now because so many tens of thousands of
[37:56.320 --> 38:01.000]  major universities and research facilities in the last really 30 years
[38:01.000 --> 38:06.000]  have come out before the FCC ever approved it they had rodent studies I'm
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.880]  gonna do a video on this today after the show a special report and the 70s and
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.040]  80s where the rodents all developed very serious cancers cancers that before
[38:15.040 --> 38:19.600]  were extremely rare a particular type of brain cancers are now commonplace and
[38:19.600 --> 38:25.000]  they're almost always right on the side of the brain where the person tends to
[38:25.000 --> 38:29.360]  hold their cell phone I tend to hold it on my left side Ted Kennedy got his on
[38:29.360 --> 38:33.320]  the side where he holds it it's a microwave relay system so powerful it
[38:33.320 --> 38:38.800]  can shoot up to 10 miles to a tower you've got a transmitter so powerful
[38:38.800 --> 38:42.920]  with a microwave blurb that it's able to go 10 miles now do you think that's
[38:42.920 --> 38:46.200]  good for your head at point-blank range
[38:47.360 --> 38:51.800]  birds don't know any better than to build their roost up on those cell
[38:51.800 --> 38:55.640]  towers they've even got preliminary studies on that where you can just climb
[38:55.640 --> 39:00.280]  up in the nest and most the eggs don't hatch the birds are stumbling around they
[39:00.280 --> 39:03.480]  got tumors all over them they don't know any better either because they're
[39:03.480 --> 39:07.200]  animals and they introduce these we get used to them we get accustomed to them
[39:07.200 --> 39:11.560]  we take them into our homes they surveil us they track us and they soft kill us
[39:11.560 --> 39:15.080]  with them and they're now coming out with this because the scourge of brain
[39:15.080 --> 39:20.960]  tumors is growing so fast that they're gonna say see we told you so and then
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.520]  they're gonna have new government approved systems and how long you can use
[39:25.520 --> 39:30.440]  them again it's all problem reaction solution they knew full well what this
[39:30.440 --> 39:34.080]  is going to do they knew that could be the the we love to communicate we love
[39:34.080 --> 39:38.320]  to have data on us and so they know that we're not gonna be able to control
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.360]  ourselves we're gonna kill ourselves even though I'm fully aware of this I
[39:42.360 --> 39:47.660]  can't help it I'm killing myself my dad knows that he can't help it he's killing

[44:23.880 --> 44:28.720]  spreading the word and I tell you I didn't hurt being on the cover of Radio

[44:34.600 --> 44:38.520]  average three big stations we love the mom and pops they're awesome too but
[44:38.520 --> 44:42.440]  we're getting three big stations a week in in major cities I mean the big
[44:42.440 --> 44:46.120]  stations a lot of them are carrying us live weekdays not just at night or on
[44:46.120 --> 44:51.120]  the weekends very exciting support their local sponsors call their sponsors
[44:51.120 --> 44:54.720]  say I'm buying a car from you because you're on the station that Alex Jones is
[44:54.720 --> 44:57.960]  on I'm buying a water heater from you because you're on the station Alex

[45:11.680 --> 45:16.520]  radio stations that have owners and managers that are patriots and know the
[45:16.520 --> 45:20.400]  world government's real and know the tyranny is real and I want to super
[45:20.400 --> 45:25.440]  charge and support them for their bet for liberty a lot of them I've been told
[45:25.440 --> 45:28.080]  aren't just picking us up because they're patriots they realize the ratings
[45:28.080 --> 45:32.760]  will get whatever whatever reason you pick it up the point is it's very
[45:32.760 --> 45:35.720]  exciting what's happening and I'm done ranting about that but be sure and
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.440]  support those local AM and FM stations and I know that is happening very very
[45:40.440 --> 45:46.960]  exciting on that front okay what are we talking about here what are we dealing
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.040]  with here what are we
[45:53.280 --> 46:02.680]  facing we are facing a total takeover of our free society and earlier before
[46:02.680 --> 46:07.280]  the last break I broke down how in Europe they started out 60 years ago
[46:07.280 --> 46:11.760]  saying if you try to start a Nazi party that's a military organization we just
[46:11.760 --> 46:15.640]  beat you are going to be arrested and then a few years later if you start a
[46:15.640 --> 46:18.320]  white supremacist organization you're going to be arrested and then a few
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.560]  years later if you criticize any official history of World War two you'll
[46:22.560 --> 46:27.680]  be arrested and then they expanded it out to what a decade ago BBC reporter
[46:27.680 --> 46:34.280]  Robin Page host of one man and his dog by the way a liberal on most issues he
[46:34.280 --> 46:38.320]  was at a rural affairs event his show is walking around England with his dog
[46:38.320 --> 46:42.760]  from small town to small town visiting pubs and churches and you know giving a
[46:42.760 --> 46:48.600]  tour very popular show in England running for many years at the time he was
[46:48.600 --> 46:52.360]  speaking in a rural affairs event where they're putting taxes on the farmers to
[46:52.360 --> 46:56.560]  shut them down banning the fox hunt that's part of their culture he better
[46:56.560 --> 47:01.960]  have a fox hunt they'll kill all your chickens and your geese and breed like
[47:01.960 --> 47:07.520]  rats and he was getting up there and he said our communities our rural
[47:07.520 --> 47:13.160]  communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals now you can pull
[47:13.160 --> 47:17.640]  this up BBC presenter arrested for using the word homosexual when they
[47:17.640 --> 47:24.620]  arrested him he said it's the name heterosexual homosexual Caucasian
[47:24.620 --> 47:29.560]  Negro you use those terms now you say hey Caucasian to white guy he'll get mad
[47:29.560 --> 47:34.320]  I mean I mean that's like calling water H2O and you're like you're racist against
[47:34.320 --> 47:39.880]  water it's the name of it and the name of a jade plant I have at my house is a
[47:39.880 --> 47:46.920]  succulent I'm not calling it you know evil the point is they arrested him for
[47:46.920 --> 47:52.800]  using the word homosexual which they now judge as inflammatory see this is
[47:52.800 --> 47:59.480]  about groups unelected bureaucracies just adding to list what they say is
[47:59.480 --> 48:05.240]  illegal now you can pull up BBC articles where they're approvingly reporting oh in
[48:05.240 --> 48:09.480]  Europe in England there are per city hundreds of police dispatched every
[48:09.480 --> 48:14.760]  week to coffee shops and restaurants and tea shops listening for criticism of
[48:14.760 --> 48:18.560]  immigrants first it was it was racial slurs if they hear you talking and
[48:18.560 --> 48:21.920]  they're recording you next to you secret police but it's okay because it's
[48:21.920 --> 48:25.280]  politically correct if secret police see and then it can be expanded to other
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.200]  things oh folks that don't like the crown folks that don't like the euro
[48:29.200 --> 48:32.960]  they may have to be arrested that's been discussed and they record you
[48:32.960 --> 48:37.040]  criticizing people from Pakistan well whether you love folks from Pakistan or
[48:37.040 --> 48:41.560]  hate them the point is it's your right to sit there at a tea shop and say man
[48:41.560 --> 48:44.640]  I'm sick and tired of the open borders and all the foreigners getting on
[48:44.640 --> 48:49.360]  welfare here and they also then tend to hire foreigners to then be the rulers
[48:49.360 --> 48:52.720]  over the people in England in Canada in the US but I have a member of the
[48:52.720 --> 48:56.400]  parliament on to break that down make the CPS workers are mainly former
[48:56.400 --> 48:59.560]  Eastern Europeans who grew up under hardcore tyranny and think it's good
[48:59.560 --> 49:02.800]  that's who comes and takes your kids they can't even speak English but again
[49:02.800 --> 49:06.440]  I'm digressing with little details here that's the problem about my thought
[49:06.440 --> 49:09.640]  process I don't sit here and think about what I'm even say I just give you the
[49:09.640 --> 49:13.000]  full spectrum of what I'm thinking about it's impossible through spoken word the
[49:13.000 --> 49:21.760]  amount of evidence is so monumental okay going back so 50 years after world
[49:21.760 --> 49:25.720]  war two we're now 60 years but 50 years 10 years ago they would arrest you for
[49:25.720 --> 49:30.120]  using the word homosexual now they're openly saying arrest people that
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.000]  criticize man-made global warming and you see Cass Sunstein here in the US
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.120]  pushing that and now the police are coming and raiding homes and harassing
[49:39.120 --> 49:42.560]  people and members of government are calling for Lord Monkton's arrest and
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.880]  they're calling for it here in the US as well we should arrest people that don't
[49:46.880 --> 49:53.440]  agree with us see so it goes from let's ban Nazi speech to now let's ban
[49:53.440 --> 49:56.880]  everybody speech and the same thing started here in the US I see cases
[49:56.880 --> 50:01.440]  every week or two where someone takes a Bible with them in their book bag and
[50:01.440 --> 50:06.000]  the teacher freaks out takes it throws it away confiscates it the kid gets
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.480]  thrown out of school but what you could bring a Harry Potter book you could
[50:09.480 --> 50:13.160]  bring a book about gardening you could bring a book about Buddha or Islam I'll
[50:13.160 --> 50:18.840]  guarantee you don't bring that Christian book because the system is going after
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.920]  the dominant group if the dominant group was Islam here in the US the system
[50:22.920 --> 50:27.080]  the social engineers will be going after that they'll use whatever group they can
[50:27.080 --> 50:32.600]  to destroy whatever the the dominant group is to drive a wedge that's the
[50:32.600 --> 50:37.840]  social engineers now here in Texas and it's the same way nationwide first it's
[50:37.840 --> 50:42.280]  don't allow prayer by the coach at the football game or don't let the principal
[50:42.280 --> 50:45.440]  say a prayer because it's a government school and some folks aren't Christians
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.480]  you could argue that's reasonable but see it's not because next now they're
[50:50.480 --> 50:53.720]  telling the valedictorian and others this is happening all over the country not
[50:53.720 --> 50:58.520]  just Texas you will not say anything about God we'll break it down we come
[50:58.520 --> 51:03.560]  back now your speech is gone we all know that Berkey water purification systems

[54:23.400 --> 54:28.640]  we're having to pull down crosses in some areas because cities pass ordinances
[54:28.640 --> 54:34.200]  and say people are offended by seeing first it's schools can't have them then
[54:34.200 --> 54:39.840]  it's 10 commandments have to be taken down then it's 200 year old crosses on
[54:39.840 --> 54:45.680]  hilltops and in cases you go back and look some old farmer you know gave the
[54:45.680 --> 54:49.160]  land you know a hundred and something years ago there's so many of these cases
[54:49.160 --> 54:52.680]  you've seen in the news all the time to have their hilltop have a cross on it
[54:52.680 --> 54:58.160]  it's given to the city and then the city later pulls it down but see in her
[54:58.160 --> 55:01.000]  political correctness you could have any other symbol you have a big Buddha up
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.440]  there you could have a menorah up there but you don't have that Christian cross
[55:05.440 --> 55:08.400]  we're gonna break that down in a moment first I want to tell you about pure

[55:39.600 --> 55:47.720]  okay now continuing here and I I know but I just want to point this out
[55:47.720 --> 55:51.720]  everybody so we consciously think about it how many hundreds of times it pecked
[55:51.720 --> 55:55.840]  probably thousands it seems like every day I scan through talk radio or the
[55:55.840 --> 56:01.160]  news I see you know every year at the start of school at the end of school but
[56:01.160 --> 56:05.760]  especially graduation you hear there will be no religious talk at the
[56:05.760 --> 56:12.920]  commencement the principal any of the speakers official speakers are told you
[56:12.920 --> 56:16.920]  will not talk about religion well I mean you could have an official speaker who
[56:16.920 --> 56:21.120]  was say a NASCAR champ at a high school if say their kid goes there and come and
[56:21.120 --> 56:25.680]  talk about NASCAR and I thank God for giving me the gift to be able to drive
[56:25.680 --> 56:30.400]  this NASCAR that well I've actually seen NASCAR guys after winning the race to
[56:30.400 --> 56:35.320]  say that or you now see in the NFL people getting in trouble for saying they
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.880]  thank God oh you're not supposed to show anything I it's replete with it you
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.200]  constantly hear about kids being sent home for having a Bible but you can have
[56:43.200 --> 56:47.120]  any other book you want it's selective it's discriminatory because if they can
[56:47.120 --> 56:52.360]  bring down the biggest group if they can target and shut up that group then they
[56:52.360 --> 56:59.480]  can shut up anybody and that's what's being done here now first it's and you
[56:59.480 --> 57:03.960]  been hearing this for over a decade oh schools all these ACLU lawsuits you can't
[57:03.960 --> 57:08.840]  have the principal get up there and give a religious speech and I tend to almost
[57:08.840 --> 57:16.840]  agree because what if the principal you know is a part of the group I don't
[57:16.840 --> 57:20.960]  agree with I mean yeah yeah Thomas Jefferson said said separation of
[57:20.960 --> 57:24.680]  church and state in a letter it's not in the Constitution saying you don't have
[57:24.680 --> 57:29.160]  the government officially setting up a religion because they always had that in
[57:29.160 --> 57:32.840]  Europe and wars over it saying we're Catholic we're Protestant we're this
[57:32.840 --> 57:36.920]  we're that we're not going to be like the Arabs killing each other over Sunni
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.560]  government or Shiite government you know we're not going to have that but that
[57:41.560 --> 57:45.800]  doesn't mean that you then can't go to school and have a Bible in your bag or
[57:45.800 --> 57:49.800]  say a prayer at lunch you've seen those articles of kids being kicked out of
[57:49.800 --> 57:54.360]  school because they say prayers at lunch that's your first amendment that's
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.760]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.080]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the press or the rather people to
[58:03.080 --> 58:08.000]  peaceably assemble for redress of grievances or the press see it's all
[58:08.000 --> 58:13.000]  there it's not just it's not just you're you're allowed to put a crucifix in a
[58:13.000 --> 58:17.000]  bowl of urine and have taxpayers pay for it that is separation of church and
[58:17.000 --> 58:21.560]  state that's what see the government does the opposite the government cannot
[58:21.560 --> 58:27.280]  build a giant cross and have you worship it and the government can't pay what
[58:27.280 --> 58:32.000]  was it a half million dollars for a crucifix in urine but now they've told
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.920]  the kids of al-Victorian others you don't talk about God or nothing or thank
[58:36.920 --> 58:41.000]  God for you get in number one grades

[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.440]  Alex Jones
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:37.440]  all right I'm ranting if you just joined us about this report it's an NBC
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.560]  shantung expression as you name it judge band's prayer at Texas graduation so now
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:49.440]  they've told the speakers the valovictorian others the judge says
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.240]  speakers cannot call an audience members to bow their heads now now now
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:01:00.040]  here's the key join in prayer or say amen and if you go read the full ruling
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:07.200]  basically they can't make religious connotations in their speech so this is
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.640]  the precedent being set with our young people who will grow up thinking bowing
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.440]  down to governments the way to go and the exact same system they put in in
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.360]  Europe and Canada you know preachers you can search the term preacher arrested
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.720]  for reading Bible passages in Canada and they have told churches in the last
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:30.760]  decade if you read passages critical of homosexuality and the whole gay
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:36.000]  lifestyle you will be arrested same things happening in Europe well folks
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.680]  regardless of what your stance is on that you should support those churches
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.600]  having their right to free speech whether you agree with them or disagree
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:52.560]  when you take their free speech away it's over I mean why do you think the
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:59.560]  ACLU has rightly defended the right of the Ku Klux Klan to March it's on
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.560]  savory most of the time it's a bunch of feds dressed up doing it that's come out
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.040]  in the Orlando newspaper and others I mean there's no real Klan people there
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.240]  it's all feds to create racial tension howl Turner the famous top Nazi as I
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.040]  told you it was an FBI operative now admitted in federal court side issue the
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:23.920]  thing here is that you'd better defend their right like I'm seeing cases of
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.600]  people now being arrested for using the n-word I saw a case a few years ago in
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:34.440]  Utah where on record at the football game the black folks called the
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:39.240]  photographer for the newspaper and the coach and other people and pull up these
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:46.120]  articles called them white you know the the white insults the honky word the
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.640]  cracker word I better not say the big holy word though the n-word and then the
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.920]  people called them that back and but that's it police said well you're allowed
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.240]  to say the honky and the cracker but you don't say the other word folks this is
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:06.120]  an obsession on words show and then the political correctness expands to San
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.320]  Francisco and other cities in the US where in the San Francisco case it was
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:18.120]  Hispanic kids wearing American flag shirts because quite frankly they were
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.480]  sick of folks running around waving Mexican flags everywhere they're like
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:25.960]  hey dude this is America and the school said you will go home you'll turn those
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.160]  shirts inside out you'll go home you don't wear an American flag here at this
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.240]  school the illegal aliens are so outraged by American flags when they see
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.920]  them it's like a vampire seeing a cross or something I guess that's I mean
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.360]  that's the way they behave that they all over the country that at gas stations
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.720]  repair shops government buildings police stations post offices you've seen on
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.080]  the news the illegals run up and in mass and pull it down and run up Mexican
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:00.280]  flags that's the political correctness of the media is like how cute how sweet
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.640]  you see and the media is like well that American flag does need to be taken
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.440]  down that's pretty evil that could incite people so see you go from saying
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:16.960]  let's ban Nazi speech to now cast Sunstein saying and notice cast Sunstein
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:22.040]  in those Harvard reports he put out and then reissued in the White House even
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.320]  Reuters covered this if you're a new listener and don't believe it and I
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.880]  don't blame me not believing it it's crazy it's over the top he said we want
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.720]  to first find people who don't believe in man make global warming or don't
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.400]  believe the official 9-11 story or believe that some sunshine is good for
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:44.280]  you these are quotes if you say any sunshine is good we'll find you and
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:49.880]  then we'll condition people to accept a rest people say why did he pick saying
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.480]  sunshine is good for you well that's going after alternative health folks
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.280]  because they pick something that seems reasonable so they can ban it so they
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:07.160]  can ban anything by setting the pressure tyranny is here the grim future
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.680]  foretold in 1984 has become reality it really says that the state is God the

[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:26.720]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:32.240]  all right I want to open the phones up today and I promise the entire third
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:37.160]  hour interspersed with key news will be your phone calls on all the incredible
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:43.640]  things going on in our world any subject any item you want to get into I want to
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.320]  break down the Federal Reserve going back on its promise to stop the printing
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.680]  presses then they're going ahead with quantitative easing three which means
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:58.880]  more inflation MSNBC is reporting that will cause more inflation in commodities
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.920]  oil gold silver you name it gold oil silver they're not really going up the
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.680]  dollars going down and we've also got this phenomenon of fights breaking up
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:17.360]  and breaking out all over the country riots breaking out and how that ties
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.640]  in to the fact that close to 50 million Americans are now on food stamps and the
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.320]  Congress is moving to cut food stamp allotment can you imagine what that is
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:31.680]  going to trigger in this country plus with inflation they're not increasing the
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.080]  amount of food stamps so regardless it won't buy as much as it did what will
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.720]  that trigger if not this summer next summer we're going to be breaking that
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:46.520]  down coming up in the next hour also World Health Organization lists cell
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.640]  phones as cancer hazard why are they doing this now I'm going to shoot a
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.640]  special video report tonight that will undoubtedly air here on the radio and
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:02.200]  TV tomorrow so stay with us on that but I will get more into it coming up to the
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:05.920]  next hour also the latest in Libya with more US and British troops there
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.160]  Obama keeping his promise to only stay a couple days not weeks of course I'm
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.080]  being sarcastic he lied NATO announcing more ground troops helicopters
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:20.800]  they'll be there at least until September as Muammar Gaddafi digs in that
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:30.720]  is all coming up in the next hour also Goldman hedges in political bets this
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:39.520]  is out of the Wall Street Journal CNBC is also reporting on it and Goldman is
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.960]  equally buying both political parties see that's how the globalist operate and
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:47.440]  then it's the politicians job to make you think there's a difference and make
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.880]  you think they're fighting with each other when all they're doing is fighting
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.880]  on who can lick boots the best of Goldman Sachs one of the majority owners
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:01.680]  one of the largest owners of the private offshore Federal Reserve so that is all
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.600]  coming up as well but you know I tell you I got a chance to meet him out in
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:14.040]  California late last year when I gave a speech two speeches to two capacity
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.200]  crowds 1800 great Californians total when I was invited out to speak in Santa
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.480]  Cruz at KSCO and he's Dr. Corey Gold received his doctorate in dental surgery
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:30.120]  from the University of California in 88 prior to that he also received a
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.240]  degree in biology with a minor in chemistry an additional bachelor's
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.200]  degree in dental sciences Dr. Gold practiced a general dentistry for more
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.080]  than 12 years until he began to get more into nutrition for the past 18 years
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:49.560]  he's been highly involved in health and natural product industry and is really a
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.800]  leading developer out there in a many of the top-selling supplements in the
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:58.880]  country very successful gentleman in his own right he's the founder and
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.920]  president of the advanced continuing education systems which is a nationally
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.600]  accredited continuing education provider for dental professionals trying to
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.040]  break some of their programming and educate them and so we're really honored
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:17.520]  to have him joining us from KSCO I don't know are you in their studios are you
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.240]  there in your office as studios Dr. Gold we're down south here in Southern
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.880]  California so we're at a remote studio here today well it's good to have you
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.960]  now we've had you on and about politics previously but I wanted to get you on for
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.040]  the balance of the hour because we've we've seen in the food safety act 17
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.800]  million given in November in one week by Big Agra to openly shut down small
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:44.960]  farms and ranches SWAT teams hitting more Amish harassment trying to shut down
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:51.280]  organic food SWAT teams in California Texas raiding farmers markets over the
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.160]  rutabaga and squash with guns drawn to create the illusion that they're doing
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.440]  something wrong that's a show for the jury later they looked they're so
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:03.240]  dangerous we came with guns the folks openly selling food Europe now people
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.960]  couldn't believe this would happen now banning hundreds and hundreds that will
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.680]  pull up those BBC on a telegraph headlines hundreds of over-the-counter
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:16.720]  supplements banned big Agra big pharma merging openly coming out and stating on
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.040]  the record I'm just setting the table here for you to talk about because you're
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:29.000]  the real expert to where they come in and patent fish oil or patent vitamin C
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.480]  change one one area of the molecule add a carbon molecule and then it's 400 bucks
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.360]  for fish oil over the counter for a hundred pills it's 300 bucks for over
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.400]  the counter vitamin C so then they ban that make you get a prescription for
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  adulterated low dose now it's happened they banned what over 300 over-the-counter
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:52.960]  supplements including vitamin B12 complexes in Europe two weeks ago they
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.000]  made good Obama put codex elementaries in the food safety act by the grace of
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.880]  God hallelujah it failed but narrowly this is for everybody out there who
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:08.280]  just joined us the games over the denials over we they had they they do
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:13.800]  want to do this to you they're coming after everybody dr. Corey gold break it
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.720]  down for us well ultimate control is taking charge of the area breathe now
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.320]  we're being told that when we exhale we're killing the world it's taking
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.080]  charge of the water they're putting fluoride in the water which is a toxin
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.440]  not good for you now they're talking about putting lithium in so you're never
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.640]  depressed seriously they're talking about putting lithium in the water because
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:33.040]  some people are sometimes depressed therefore everybody has to have the
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.080]  lithium in their water and now they're talking about the food we have to eat
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.680]  because the food we have to eat is now needs to be genetically modified so it
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:44.120]  produces its own pesticides so literally we're told that every time we exhale
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.400]  we're killing the world we're told that when we drink water it's got to make us
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.120]  happy and that the normal food that people have been eating for 5,000 years
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.440]  6,000 years isn't good enough for you it's got to be genetically modified maybe
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  putting an animal with a plant together with a pesticide together so that the
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.440]  crops may grow bigger probably won't but you owe your life to other people and
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.000]  other government so literally we're being told I'm waiting for Girl Scouts to be
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.480]  rounded up for selling cookies on the street for not holding their cookies
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.840]  right or being in the Sun too much I'm waiting for kids to be arrested for
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.600]  lemonade stands on the corners because literally it's becoming a grid of
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:23.440]  control about how you breathe what you know how what you drink is water and what
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.960]  kind of food that you eat wait a minute doctor they've already sent the police
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:32.520]  out to write fines to Girl Scouts in multiple states they are shutting down
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:37.560]  lemonade stands so this is already begun oh I mean it's absolutely bananas and
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.200]  now I know they're talking about controlling if you want to grow some
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:43.520]  tomatoes in your backyard you know they're saying listen if you grow tomatoes
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.800]  in your backyard something bad might happen with the tomatoes in your backyard
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.640]  it may create chaos in the entire food chain therefore you can't grow your own
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.360]  food and once you can't grow your own food or clean your own water or you know
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.400]  control the air around you you're basically a slave to other people and
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.120]  your health is not your own so I mean it's becoming very scary out there and
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.720]  you see the drug companies coming out he said before with fish oils all of a
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.520]  sudden we discovered fish oils my my father who's now in his 80s when he
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.800]  didn't feel well he had had cod liver oil they would just simply do the right
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.800]  things a lot of things that people used to do a hundred 200 years ago make a lot
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:24.760]  of sense but now it's a $300 drug to have a better fish oil the reality fish
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.320]  oil is pretty much fish oil and they change it a little bit so now you'll
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.200]  maybe they'll take fish oil off the market because you have to have the
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.720]  prescription fish oil and politicians want to be reelected politicians want
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:40.120]  money in their pockets politicians want nobody to run against them politicians
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.920]  don't even know what they're voting on most the time they simply have lobbyists
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.760]  tell them what's the best sometimes they don't really know sometimes they do
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.720]  know and look the other direction but at the end of the day look what's happened
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:54.120]  with health care is it getting better no is it getting cheaper no is it getting
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:58.640]  quicker no is getting worse in all those metrics but we were told hey don't worry
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.840]  you don't need to know what's in the bill but once it once you read it you're
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.560]  gonna like it we don't like it but it's long nonetheless same things with all
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.720]  these other things for our own protection we're too stupid we need to be we need to
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.160]  be protected by our government therefore I'm telling you they're gonna
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.440]  literally come into household checks what's in your refrigerator how many
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:20.640]  Oreo cookies do you give your kids do you give you give your kids Doritos we
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.760]  know about schools in Chicago where literally if you bring your own lunch to
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:27.760]  school if you bring your own lunch to school regardless of what's in that
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.760]  lunch they'll throw it away how dare you bring your own lunch what were your
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.440]  parents thinking packing you an apple packing you know packing you a good
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:40.040]  sandwich what were they thinking the school knows best and now the Pentagon is
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.760]  putting in and San Antonio in other areas in one elementary a two million
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:49.760]  dollar AI software computer camera to watch each child as they eat and track
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.200]  what they're eating and putting it in government reports yeah and the more the
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:59.200]  government has been helping us with food think about this 50 years ago the
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.920]  government wasn't too involved in food nobody was obese very few people are
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.520]  obese since they've been helping us more and more and more with great food
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.720]  decisions more and more people have diabetes more and more people are obese
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:15.520]  more and more people have chronic illnesses and you hear the word managing
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.160]  disease you don't hear the word curing disease or getting people better you
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.640]  hear the word managing disease because when you're managing disease you can
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.280]  keep people taking things for long periods of time that's good for the
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:31.480]  healthcare industry that's good for the drug industry well you're absolutely
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:36.680]  right and and and expanding on this they now have put codex
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:43.200]  alimentarius in place and they actually tried to pass this UN law last year in
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:47.480]  the food safety act that actually said adopt codex alimentarius so the so
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:53.160]  they're actually trying to do what they've now done headline hundreds of
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:59.480]  herbal remedies pulled from shelves under EU rule yeah and it was interesting
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.120]  is is that there's no trial to say that those were unsafe there was no trial to
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.640]  say my goodness somebody's having vitamin C or somebody's having vitamin B that
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:10.720]  somehow it's unsafe for them they were pulled simply because that's what the
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.120]  rule says to do the rule doesn't have to make sense it's simply the rule
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.440]  therefore since we're harmonizing which is which is a terrible word because it
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.680]  makes you think that something's gonna get better somehow harmony sounds good
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.240]  in government most of the words that sound the best are usually the worst
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:29.320]  when they start harmonizing things it's not usually for your harmony so they're
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:35.040]  harmonizing laws that your laws now agree with foreign laws meanwhile all your
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.800]  rights have been taken away to eat the things you want to eat and your parental
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.960]  rights are being taken away well this is a big deal to have the Obama
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:48.760]  administration and Meg Agra tried to put through codex alimentarius let's break
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.480]  down what codex alimentarius will do if they're able to implement it here and
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.720]  what they're already starting to do in Europe on the other side they
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.920]  industrialize the food they adulterated then they make it illegal to not eat
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:05.160]  their food if you suffer from poor sleep you need my pillow guaranteed to be the

[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:21.800]  everybody rolls with their fingers crossed everybody knows the war is

[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.000]  because we didn't know there was a war going on but now more and more people
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.360]  know there's a war on for their mind their property their children their
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:43.440]  ideas their liberties and we are rising now if you think I'm joking you can just
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:49.800]  search herbal remedies banned as new EU rule takes effect you can also pull up
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.920]  the BBC and normally I could find stuff really quick I couldn't find it jaren
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.280]  couldn't but I bet we'll find it soon I remember the Daily Mail and BBC headlines
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:02.320]  hundreds of herbal remedies pulled from shelves it's something like that we're
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.760]  gonna find it the point is this is really going on here's the London Guardian
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:16.200]  this is from just a few days ago herbal remedies banned as new EU rules take
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:21.800]  effect and it's actually from May 1st so a month ago manufacturers and herbal
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.320]  practitioners say strict guidelines aimed at improving safety could force
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.800]  them out of business and it goes on and you can pull up the headlines hundreds
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.640]  and hundreds and hundreds of mainline herbs you are being pulled from the
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:41.520]  shelves under this UN agreement written by the big pharma a production
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:48.360]  outfits just like big agra openly is financing the food safety bill to shut
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.760]  down the farms and ranches where the Amish aren't even allowed to put out any
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.760]  dust but big companies they're given exemptions they could put all the dust
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.160]  they want out but the Amish you aren't actually even hurting the land compared
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.000]  to the big agra oh they now have the have the bureaucrats being unleashed on
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.080]  them and it's happening to everybody Corey this is a systematic monopoly being
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:14.640]  set up by the big mega corporations and they're on record the Department of
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:18.880]  Agriculture openly tells farmers and ranchers get bigger get out this is
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.480]  about a consolidation and and and all the third world food pouring in isn't
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.280]  enough to break the back of American farmers a group the big banks have been
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.680]  waging war against for over a hundred years in this country they don't want us
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:38.720]  being independent they want us just like when old Joe Stalin went after the
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.840]  Ukrainian farmers they always want to shut down people being self-sufficient
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.200]  why is that dr. Gold well it's control look what just happened in America on
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.440]  another front you know I'm a big American sovereignty first person and here we
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:58.840]  are having a war and by my definition in Libya the Congress didn't vote on it the
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.240]  president says it's not a war but NATO authorized it so a force outside the
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:08.120]  United States has taken American troops into war and yet nobody's
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.680]  recognizing that and here we are now with something the Codex which is a
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:17.480]  World Health Organization through the UN which they want to impose upon us so the
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.760]  world will decide you know how we drink and what we eat and what kind of
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:25.360]  vitamins we can or can't have so now we're gonna have the world deciding
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.800]  what's right for you in Texas with right for me in California what's right for
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.280]  Ted Anderson over in Minnesota when do we give up sovereignty when you give up
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.840]  your right to decide what you eat what you breathe what you drink how you do
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.400]  those things and when the rest of the world is now controlling your food
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.240]  supply it's not a great place but who would want to do this and why would they
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.600]  want to do this well drug companies have obviously love having control over
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.080]  large you know large groups of people and if people are taking supplements or
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.800]  people are taking healthy food your body's a gigantic chemistry set and if
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.720]  you feed it the right things it knows what to do with those ingredients if it
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.200]  the food is void of all those ingredients all those nutrients it can
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.560]  operate well so you need to seek things else outside whether through
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:16.800]  nutritional supplements or through drugs and so they get you in a trap where you
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.400]  don't have food that feeds you you get fat that's one reason why people are so
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.720]  obese they're starving they're they're heavy but they're starving so you have
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.400]  things like the World Health Organization coming along with the UN and
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:32.880]  I'm still trying to find out what the UN's good for we pay off a lot of money
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.160]  to have the United Nations and I'm still waiting for it to do something that I'm
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.120]  happy about and but now they're telling us remembering the 1980s the world was
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:44.800]  cold gonna be freezing then in the year 2000 the world's gonna be hot so they
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.760]  finally figured it out yes the world will be cold sometimes yes the world
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.800]  will be hot sometimes so now it's gonna be called climate change so you can't
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.000]  exhale anymore and cows are ruining the world because you know they have gases
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.400]  that they really and so what they're saying is any change on the planet is
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:03.840]  abnormal but don't worry they can genetically splice plants and animals
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:07.920]  and insects that's safe when it's super dangerous they can do all these they
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.840]  can say Fukushima radiation at many times normal levels hitting the US is
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.120]  now safe by raising the number of what they say is safe but meanwhile that
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:20.480]  evil carbon dioxide that's part of the life cycle that's what they've got a tax
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:26.240]  and it's the perfect thing to go after so they can then target all facets of
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.920]  industry yeah and you wonder why people are are so paranoid all the time you're
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.080]  told every time you breathe every time you drive your car every time you exist
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:37.280]  in the world you're killing the world and somehow that's a good thing too
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:41.960]  because people why do we need to have people on this planet after all Alex well
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:46.480]  let's talk about the eugenics program on the other side and and why the system
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:50.480]  doesn't want people having access to vitamins and minerals well they're right
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:57.360]  back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:26.520]  analyst saying that we are basically on the verge of a depression in fact that's
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:32.280]  the headline market strategist we're on the verge of a great great depression
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:38.120]  ladies and gentlemen the Federal Reserve is monetizing over 70% last number we
[01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:42.120]  got was 71 that was six months ago they haven't released new numbers they admit
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:45.400]  they're monetizing more than they were before the Chinese were getting the
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:50.280]  numbers from them they're buying a lot less and I know I'm digressing off into
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:57.480]  another issue it's just I don't want there to be a depression I don't want the
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:02.480]  dollar to be devalued but it's a fact that it's happening I was on Mancow

[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.240]  he plays devil with advocate and he said Alex you know the economy is getting
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.960]  better it's turning around you want to reverse your statement on that and here
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.520]  I am interviewing former Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz here I'm

[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.080]  three years ago they would have let us have a real recession and cut back on
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.920]  the amount of debt made at Wall Street take a huge haircut on the too big to
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:49.840]  fail we could have began to reverse all of this and it would have been really
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.960]  painful it's like if you got a heroin addict they've been shooting heroin for
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:59.080]  two years they're getting up to a really big dose and the doctor says look
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:02.400]  you got to go off this now because you're having to take a bigger and bigger
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:06.600]  dose to get the same effect pretty soon you're gonna overdose that's what tends
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.320]  to happen and the heroin head says no give me more and so yeah they're
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:16.480]  mainlining the last three years more more more more more more and every
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.080]  economist 150 I'm just wrote a letter to Obama that's in the news today saying
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.540]  we are gonna have a depression if you don't turn around the problem is the
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:29.320]  Republicans and the Democrats the Republicans made 40 billion dollars in
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:35.840]  cuts that I mean that's not a haircut that's like cutting one hair off your
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.600]  head so if the Republicans make 40 billion and the Democrats want to
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.720]  increase where does that tell you we're going I know I'm ranting we got Corey
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.240]  Gold with us all in a little bit in the next hour because he's got so much to
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.560]  talk about but obviously the first of many interviews I've been a guest on his
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:53.840]  show and been out there to visit the great folks at this the grip of station
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.200]  sees on out in California that we're also on but just in case you think I'm
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.160]  joking herbal medicines banned as EU directive comes into force you pull up
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:09.000]  the other headlines hundreds of vitamins minerals pulled off shelves under EU
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.760]  directive here's one and guardian herbal remedies banned as new EU rules take
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:19.400]  effect let me quantify this as we go to Dr. Gold let me quantify this for
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.560]  anybody out there who's trying to figure out exactly why this is happening in
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:29.800]  2005 one of the board members of the new freedom initiative federal government
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:35.600]  body that George W. Bush appointed broke ranks out of Ohio a doctor went public
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:41.240]  and said we've got roughly 20% of young people in America on some type of
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:48.080]  psychotropic or and Fetiman Ritalin Adderall type drug he said it's purely
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.720]  about profit I've been in at the presidential level meetings and this
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:55.880]  went but he released the documents it made a minor flurry in mainstream news
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:03.760]  for a week or two that under new freedom their plan is by 2015 to have 50% of
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:10.240]  school children on psychotropic or in Fetimans and by 2020 to have over 90%
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:17.880]  this is a revolution a total takeover now what does big agra do they lobby to
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:21.360]  shut down local farms and ranches put regulations on them they're exempt from
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:24.920]  shut down their competition what a John D Rockefeller the founders say
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:31.840]  competitions of sin expanding if you go from there and you look at big pharma
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.200]  they openly go to the federal government and lobby to get vaccine
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.520]  liability protection so when they dump a new vaccine in the market that in their
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.480]  trials like Gardasil they know we're gonna kill people they've been given
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:51.440]  federal mandate so they now get any lawsuits paid off and it goes into a
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.360]  special kangaroo federal court to begin with but you can jump through all
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.280]  those hoops then you get a paltry settlement they couldn't get Merck
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:03.400]  couldn't get Gardasil approved by the feds so they went to Texas and had Rick
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.960]  Perry quote order all girls to take it another hoax he just recommended it be
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:11.480]  part of the recommended regimen by the state health department and girls lined
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:15.360]  up took it died had convulsions they didn't care it kicked in liability
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.440]  protection and so a drug a vaccine with a live virus that they knew was killing
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.440]  people in the trials that's ABC CBS news now they could still roll it out and
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:30.040]  kill people and be given government protection so you've got a vaccine makers
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:33.880]  their lobbying to try to make whatever new vaccines they come out with they've
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.720]  got hundreds of new ones pending approval right now to force you to take
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:41.840]  them 30 years ago the average child below 10 took what six seven shots now
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:47.240]  it's over 50 they want it in the hundreds and they will go lobby to get
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:52.200]  something approved they know will kill you in many cases maim you in many other
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:56.160]  cases and in the insert for Gardasil doesn't even protect you now Corey I
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:00.640]  know I'm ranting here it's just that we need to face up to this and now they're
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.080]  coming after our vitamins and minerals but my solution is I want to hear your
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:08.280]  take on this and the things I just said 10 years ago you couldn't find a real
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.160]  organic certified food at any grocery store but Whole Foods now all the main
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:18.440]  line stores it's supplanting and is now more than 50% of the food now you can't
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:23.240]  find the GMO milk at least in stores I see in Texas just two years ago was 50
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.880]  50 they're at a panic point their power grab is because they're weak and and
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.960]  because they know we're waking up so they're trying to close the barn door
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.440]  on us do you agree they're panicking because of yourself and many others
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.880]  there's a revolution of understanding happening well I think the internet's
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.040]  doing it in people like myself people like you and people like others Ben
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:47.240]  Fuchs dr. Walik others you know are doing this because people are making
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.920]  people aware of a different point of view think about this you said we may be
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.440]  you're going toward a Great Depression I think we're in one I told my daughter
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:57.840]  this and she said no no I've seen the pictures of the Great Depression people
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.000]  lined up in bread lines what she doesn't understand and we talked about this is
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.960]  people would be in bread lines right now except we gave them digital cards so
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.200]  they can take their bread line card to the local store and not have to wait in
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.600]  the lines if they didn't have these digitized cards that lets you have
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.840]  government food and go into local Ralph's or Kroger's or Walmart and get the
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.880]  food people would be lining up in every city to get food and then we'd have this
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.840]  great shock on our face of oh my god look at all the people in our community
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.920]  who depend upon the government to eat every day it's it's like what 15% of
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:38.840]  the people it's kind of 39% in since so President Obama took office 39% more
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:42.560]  people on government assistance for food so we are in a Great Depression where
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.120]  such a great percentage of Americans depend on the government for food and
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.120]  back during the Great Depression people had the capability of making their own
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.400]  food they knew how to do it they have the space they had the resources they
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.320]  all didn't live in cities today nobody I mean virtually nobody makes their own
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:01.280]  food or has the capability of the space to do it so we really are in a crisis
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.240]  spot we look at the Middle East and that people say gee it's because everyone's
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.480]  yearning for freedom people are yearning to eat in the Middle East because
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:14.680]  America keeps on printing money with QE1 and QE2 and probably QE3 and QE4 and
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.800]  they'll keep going on and on till finally we break the machines to print
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:22.800]  money people can't afford to eat because everything's based in US dollars so they
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.800]  don't have enough money to eat in the Middle East so we are creating great
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:29.120]  havoc around why are we doing this there's lots of reasons we can look at
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.960]  it today the stock market's tumbling the government's favorite word government's
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.240]  favorite word is the word unexpected unexpectedly things aren't going the
[01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:41.120]  way we thought they'd go people aren't going back to work weren't we told
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:45.160]  unemployment would be down unemployment's not going down what we told that
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:49.320]  costs of health care would be going down cost of health there's going up wouldn't
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.520]  you know I'm just mind boggled how everybody's mind numb to what's
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:58.000]  happening around them everything that we see around us we were gonna close
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.720]  Guantanamo Guantanamo's open I win the Nobel Prize we're having we're doing
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.560]  drone attacks in in Pakistan and we're we're not fighting a war where we're
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.440]  giving love bombs in Libya I don't even understand how people just look at the
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.960]  news each night and don't see what's in front of them now we're being told that
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:17.760]  healthy fruits and vegetables vitamins and minerals might be bad for you
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.720]  however we have drugs to fix everything and people look at the commercials and
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:26.200]  say gee look at all those happy people walkie on the beach I want to be like
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:30.880]  those happy people walkie on the beach I better tell my my but my doctor I need
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.160]  that drug the doctor doesn't tell you what drugs you need you're supposed to go
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.240]  ask your doctor if XYZ drug would be right for you what about the Harvard
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.080]  documents that got leaked last week are confirmed to be authentic what we already
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.880]  knew that medical doctors across the board that their professors are told
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:53.440]  to indoctrinate them under big pharma grants and federal grants tied to it to
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:58.320]  teach them to be drug dispensers and not people actually practicing medicine
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:06.920]  that is learning more it's the universities get paid money grant money
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.320]  you can call what you want they call it grant money to do research so if you
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:14.600]  want to keep doing research and you want to keep having money come into your
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:19.640]  institution it's play nice with the big pharma companies and I don't blame a
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:22.680]  lot of doctors out there the average doctor who goes to medical school has
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:28.720]  very limited training in the area of health through nutrition and diet and
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.800]  supplementation so they don't know what they don't know and so to some degree the
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:37.920]  doctors are going out blind in this area but more and more doctors are becoming
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.520]  aware of this more and more doctors are becoming holistic in their orientation
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.000]  and I think we're tipping it over to the point where people are frightened in the
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.400]  you know in the system that people start taking charge and control back of their
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:54.840]  own lives back of their diet back of their water back of the air that they
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:57.800]  breathe and look at all the people who advertise on your show those are those
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:00.880]  the kind of people like you know we with you with the info wars team with the
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.800]  products that we provide and the people who purify water through your show and
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.800]  and air purifiers and such people are learning about the different opportunities
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.920]  out there available to take charge of their own health now now system now
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.880]  dr. gold that's the next place I want to go we know that big pharma openly is
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:22.080]  financing they've been able to do it in Europe starting to ban mainline minerals
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.000]  supplements they do not want people having access to this because they know
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.360]  the tipping point is coming just like people demanding organic food organic
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:37.560]  milk growth hormone just seven eight years ago there were lawsuits by Monsanto
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:42.240]  and others to try to stop people from criticizing it now they failed there on
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.560]  so many fronts we're starting to win so they're rushing in trying to shut us
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:51.200]  down I've done my own research and I remember also remember several summers
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:57.400]  working for a large animal vet who was obsessed with cows pigs sheep chickens
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:01.120]  things like that with with the minerals and the vitamins they were giving and
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:05.120]  so many times you know if they had a problem he would point out studies
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.240]  where if cows don't have the right minerals they'll freeze to death but if
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:13.000]  they do have the right minerals they don't and so that's why I saw dr.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.880]  Wollick's information more than a decade ago it really clicked of course he's a
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.200]  famous veterinarian and then biologist in his own right but that's why I
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.040]  decided to team up I don't know three four months ago with young Jevity now
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:31.720]  my mother my dad but especially my wife Ted Anderson's dad with serious all
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:35.720]  simers couldn't remember who he was or where he was got him on the fatty acids
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.080]  got him on the minerals suddenly and I mean Ted's like I can't believe it it
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:44.720]  works his dad can go fishing now his dad has short-term memory back and then I
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:47.880]  have a totally separate guy not involved with the young Jevity not involved
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.720]  with us you know famous brain surgeon event many of the most used brain
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:58.240]  surgeries out there I have dr. Russell Blalock on and he talks about the fact
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:01.880]  that the brain doesn't have the fatty acids it needs he talks about the
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:07.760]  minerals and he separately describes how you can reverse or at least stop all
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:13.400]  simers and that they knew this decades ago but it's open source it's it's
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:18.200]  basically next to free compared to these expensive drugs and that they know
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:23.080]  statins are exacerbating and accelerating because they attack cholesterol
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:27.480]  and the brain is mainly cholesterol the part that's solid they know what they're
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:32.640]  doing so I wanted to run through some of the products and when folks purchase
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:37.360]  these they also support the broadcast info wars team dot-com will put it up on
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.600]  screen or if folks want to call and ask questions about the lines of products
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:48.160]  877-551-1301 I really believe in this and I've only been on it a few months I
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.160]  can really feel the difference my wife absolutely loves it she doesn't want me
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:56.080]  to talk about one of her medical things but it's reversed it and I'm just gonna
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:00.640]  leave it at that but folks I believe in this I promote what I believe in I
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.040]  believe in young Jevity products the system doesn't want you to have these
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.840]  they're the best out there run down a list of some of the products that we
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:14.880]  carry at info wars team dot-com well probably the the most important ones the
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.760]  Alex pack we named it after you when we wanted people to have a focus point
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:22.720]  where to start you're looking at trying to give your body what it needs and your
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:27.360]  body basically needs what needs lots of things but think of 90 essential nutrients
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:32.280]  it needs amino acids it needs vitamins it needs minerals and needs fatty acid so
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:36.240]  we put together one pack that gives you those things so it gives you all your
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.160]  12 essential amino acids it gives you your 16 essential vitamins gives your 16
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.880]  essential minerals and gives you your fat if you're fatty acids so you get it
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.920]  all in one package and so when somebody says you know I where do I start there's
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.640]  so many things on the shelf out there start with the very basics make sure
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.920]  you're getting your vitamins make sure you're getting minerals and a lot of
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.080]  people just take vitamins but they don't get the minerals and the minerals are
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:01.600]  very very important and they're missing in most plants today so getting
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.640]  minerals is super important and a lot of people don't get enough calcium and
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.800]  magnesium so especially women as they're getting older the Alex pack would be
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.280]  perfect for them so that's a really great place to start it's a it's like
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.880]  that your essential beginning block of nutrition and from there you add on
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:22.320]  there's all kind of great things you can take to expand on that because yeah
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.800]  going back you know I started promoting this three four months ago I guess
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:31.200]  longer now time flies but before that you know I told Ted I told you know Michael
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:35.240]  I was whirling great guy who carries me on some of the stations in California who
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.000]  really believes that I've met with him I said send me some I just stuck it in
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.600]  the closet and my wife's like what is this I want more I've been on this two
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:47.360]  weeks I have so much more energy to work out it's not a placebo I just left it
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:52.960]  there then I started taking it and I'm like okay let's see what this tangy
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.680]  tangerine beyond tangy tangerine does you know that a super mineral boost with
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:01.160]  every mineral and trace element in there dump it in drink it and boy I was like
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:06.200]  man I can taste that it's strong I'm not gonna tell folks it tastes great it's
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.960]  not like these mineral drinks that taste great you know it tastes like I mean it
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:13.640]  doesn't taste bad but it tastes really strong you could taste all these
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.000]  different flavors that you've never experienced and then boom 30 minutes
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.360]  later I could tangibly every time feel it we just ran out last week and I'm
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:28.120]  like get me more tangy tangerine normally I won't take vitamins and
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.320]  minerals because I don't feel like I get a result from it I'm really getting a
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.680]  result from this what you're right and by the way when you're taking things
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:39.640]  such as plant-drived minerals you know that it's it by way I think it tastes
[01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:42.000]  great compared to what it tastes like ten years ago I've been working a long
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.600]  time trying to get the flavor just right pollen versus another product that
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:50.000]  tastes perfect by the way you develop that I forgot I did well pollen burst I
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.840]  did I can't take credit for beyond tangy tangerine that's dr. Joe wall
[01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:56.920]  experience but I even forgot my wife loves the taste of the pollen burst but
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:00.280]  I mean I'm not knocking it that has a strong taste I mean it's not bad I'm
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:05.080]  just saying it's it's powerful oh it's amazing and what's funny is is that most
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:08.560]  people just wake up and they go through the day they eat the foods that they eat
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.000]  and they think how they feel is the normal way you're supposed to feel and
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.600]  then when the body starts getting the vitamins minerals nutrients it needs it
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.480]  can feel better because it can start repairing itself it can give you more
[01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:25.080]  energy your body produces energy it does it you know it's not like you eat it
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.160]  and energy and packets it has to create those substances that create energy so
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.880]  you need to give them all the building blocks and when you don't give it the
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:34.960]  building blocks it creates out of other bad things it's kind of like polluting
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:38.880]  your system there so we're trying to give it the pure fuel stay there I want
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:43.040]  to come back and and talk about some of the most common mineral and vitamin

[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:10.440]  folks to break this down I've been around and worked a lot in farming and
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:16.320]  ranching and it was well known by the old timers that if you didn't get
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:20.880]  minerals into the soil and then you fed your cows that grass that your cows no
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:25.040]  matter how much grass they ate would would would wither away but that if you
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:28.720]  put the right fertilizer that's why sometimes they would burn their fields
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:32.640]  on purpose and control burns it would put some of the minerals back in and
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:38.760]  then your cows would be healthy and it's the same thing what Dr. Gold was
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:43.920]  talking about and there's so many studies on this that Americans eat eat eat eat
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:50.120]  eat eat eat and and now more and more Europeans our diets if you go back even
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.840]  a hundred years folks were eating things that we would think of today as even more
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:55:00.080]  unhealthy fried foods pies pinging out but they were getting the trace minerals
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.880]  they needed so they weren't eating five meals a day of unhealthy things they're
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:08.040]  reading three meals a day of unhealthy things or things that are seen as that
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:13.160]  so you can put on fat cells eating marshmallows with no nutritional value
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:19.880]  but then your organs your blood the building blocks of the complex tissue
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:24.440]  systems they're not getting what they need so you're eating more to get the
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:29.680]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements you need so you're putting on more
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:34.080]  calories because you've got to eat more of the GMO crud to get what you need is
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.840]  that putting it in a layman's nutshell dr. Gold yeah I think everybody knows
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:42.240]  out there that the soils have been worked to death that they're not using
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:45.720]  the side to types of soil preservation techniques they did you know a hundred
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:50.000]  years ago and they so you're getting food that's the void of vitamins and
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.280]  minerals and nutrients and they work more at making it look good and lasting
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:57.200]  longer on the shelf than they do a putting the vitamins and minerals into
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.240]  it so they're more worried about how it appears to you in the store is it red or
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:03.960]  is it well last eight days versus six days in the shelf that's what they're
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:08.120]  spending the research dollar on how does it look versus what's in it for my
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:11.760]  nutrition point of view well one of our friends grows a bunch of heirloom
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:16.400]  tomatoes and a lot of more some of them are pretty just a bunch of varieties
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:20.840]  some were ugly but I was eating them last night they tasted completely different
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:24.720]  than anything I've gotten in a store in 20 years they tasted delicious they had
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.000]  all these bouquets these flavors instead of these big beautiful looking
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.440]  tomatoes you get at the store that are GMO they have no flavor yeah we're told
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:36.840]  that GMO supposed to be great for us you think they'd be proud to put it on the
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:42.000]  labels but instead you're not allowed to say on your food that you're not GMO so
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.520]  people are waking up to the fact that GMO may not be good for you and they
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:50.160]  want to put on the on their labels no GMOs they're not even allowed to write
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:53.640]  that isn't that amazing they're not allowed to write what they're not we do
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:58.520]  not contain GMOs in this food they're not allowed by law to write that incredible
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.200]  I really believe in the young Jevity products and folks you've heard Ted
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.080]  Anderson talk about his dad who they'd be fishing and his dad didn't even know
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:13.240]  they were fishing huge reversal with the short-term memory of his dad in just I
[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:17.080]  don't know three four months and he's trying to get him on more of the products
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.280]  and then I have Dr. Blalock on nothing to do with young Jevity and he says
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:25.040]  exactly what the other researchers that we've had on and and what's so
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:31.000]  frustrating here dr. Gold is the system knows this and they're fighting to keep
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.440]  the public from being aware of it a lot of its territorialism you know people
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:39.200]  like to preserve their own space so they they fight that their way is the only
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:43.520]  way versus integrating in with other health professionals you know they want
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.600]  to maintain the head of the food chain when it comes to literally who's in
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:51.240]  charge of health everybody listening knows they've been taught since
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.320]  elementary school that if you eat healthy it's good for you we all know that
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:00.160]  eating junk foods bad for us so we're kind of you know we're being brainwashed
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:03.840]  the opposite because of all the fast food commercials and the alcohol
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.560]  commercials and you know all the different things that we see the reality is
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:10.920]  deep downside that we know that if we're eating healthy getting organic putting
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:13.800]  vitamins and minerals into our system we're gonna be a lot healthier and our
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:17.600]  body can really do a lot of magnificent things we're divinely created

[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.440]  attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the

[01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:31.800]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.840]  Jones.
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:37.760]  Final segment with Dr. Corey Gold, one of the developers and researchers has
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:41.320]  worked with some of the great young Jevvie products available at info wars
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:48.480]  team.com. I've talked to a lot of women I know some women and it's an epidemic
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:51.840]  out there even young women with their hair falling out and then you go to the
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:55.440]  health food store and they got pills and it says healthy hair and nail support
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.960]  but then I read you know the inserts and they admit with pills most of it
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:06.000]  passes through you. The difference with young Jevvie with the pollen burst and
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:09.760]  the beyond tangy tangerine those are my two favorites available at info wars
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:14.000]  team.com is that you absorb and I've had pharmacists on to break this down as
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:21.560]  well almost all of it instead of just passing it through your body and women
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:25.560]  are reporting that within just a few months of this their hair starts growing
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:29.320]  back in there's also you've got the African tribes that don't get enough
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:34.360]  iodized they have the giant swollen you know throats and their thyroids.
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:38.840]  Thyroid malfunctions off the charts and the doctors will put them on thyroid
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:42.720]  drugs instead of saying hey you need minerals I mean they know what's going
[02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:48.080]  on. Well you hope they would I mean they're smart people and they know that
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:51.520]  a lot of things especially with a thyroid gland deals with energy you talk
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:54.120]  about goiters you were talking about before and then you're talking about
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:58.480]  peripheral vascularization that's why people who have diabetes and things have
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:01.240]  you know why are their fingers and their toes having issues it's on the
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.720]  peripheries or their scalp having issues with circulation so yeah if you're
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:09.280]  getting good nutrition and it's getting in I hate when people say we have a
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:11.720]  hundred percent absorption it's false nothing's a hundred percent but we do a
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:15.560]  great job of getting absorption of the nutrients in we work hard at it this is
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:19.640]  what we do we're very proud of what we're do and we have. What absorption did I say
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:24.840]  and was I right to say close to total? Yeah it's really great and it's a lot
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:28.520]  more than pills well do you have any number on that then? We can't you know
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:31.880]  the studies that the government require us to make a claim on the amount of
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.760]  absorption would put any company out of business and that and that's the
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.600]  and that's part of the plan so I'm very careful on what I say we work really
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:41.720]  hard at absorption we're proud of our absorb we know it works people who take
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:45.320]  our products and feel the difference my wife always has this great saying she
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.160]  says just try the product your body will tell you how to think about it and we
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:52.160]  always believe that way you put it into your body your body will tell you and
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.320]  people don't feel that way with most products they try a product and they
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:59.080]  don't feel anything right they go well it must be working I don't know you take
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.000]  a young jeffie product you go to info wars team dot com you try pollen burst

[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:08.560]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:12.720]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:16.760]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:20.640]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:24.960]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:29.120]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:33.400]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:37.120]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.600]  calm suddenly everyone is warning about the next financial collapse they tell
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:26.640]  you everything's fine until they're getting ready for the next collapse and
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:31.360]  now they started talking about the next collapse so we're gonna be going over
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:35.640]  that the Fed announces QE 3 through their minions we're gonna be going over
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:41.160]  that coming up right now though let's go to your phone calls Richard in
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:46.120]  California you're on the air welcome Alex it's such an honor and pleasure to
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:52.280]  talk to you thank you dinos to you brother listen I called in because I've
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:57.080]  been a researcher in natural health and economics and some other very
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:01.560]  interesting areas for the last 40 years and I just wanted to let you know that
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:05.280]  this is another one of those big announcements everybody already knows
[02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:10.560]  not only a sunlight good for you it's absolutely essential for health and the
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.080]  everybody wearing dark glasses and sunscreen is exactly because of that
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:20.080]  it's great for the drug dealers well like they say they're coming out with all
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:24.880]  these new happy pills they want to put everybody on and literally you just
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:31.040]  type in study shows moderate sunlight decreases most cancers in fact let's
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:35.680]  just put that into a search engine moderate sunlight reduces many cancers
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:40.360]  they know that they know they've had this for over 50 years in Sweden and
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:46.960]  Denmark and northern Europe that they had record suicide rates and now they did
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.720]  the studies in the last 50 years but now in the last 20 years they've put
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:57.960]  sunlight lamps in the buildings under law in the winter they have white walls
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.720]  to give because the eyes are supposed to get some of that light as well and it
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.120]  affects brain chemistry and then they know this and Cass Sunstein comes out
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:11.320]  and says and again folks I know this sounds like a lie it's so crazy if you
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:16.440]  just look it up you put out two reports he's a lighthouse regulations are that
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:21.840]  if you say sunlight is good for you you should be arrested he says that's a
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:27.400]  conspiracy theory why would they not want us to get any sunlight Richard well
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:31.760]  because it has a lot of effect on the on the physical body one is is bone
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:37.240]  density for example the other is the resistance against cancer and most of
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:41.280]  the enzyme reactions in the body also are connected into getting sunlight and
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:46.160]  through the eyes is probably the most important way to get it and that's what
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:50.000]  you're warned against it's very similar to how people were warned that the seeds
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.880]  and apples were poisonous and you should never eat them because they actually
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:13:00.440]  contain B17 so it's not my mistake and it ultimately it has nothing to do with
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.960]  money even though the drug dealers have their huge empire making billions of
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:10.840]  dollars it's based on step-by-step profitable slow and painful human
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:14.640]  I've seen the studies now where where people are getting increased skin
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:18.880]  cancer who aren't getting sun and folks on explain this if you get tons of sun
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:23.240]  you're gonna end up looking like a shaler when you're 40 or 50 you know you
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:27.240]  see these beautiful young women who are sun worshipers and they look older
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:31.280]  because of it it doesn't matter your skin is the biggest organ in the body it
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:35.880]  makes vitamin D out of the sun the type you totally absorb anybody knows and
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.840]  even old-timers a hundred years ago psychologist psychiatrist would say if
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.880]  you're depressed go out and and hike on us on a sunny day everybody knows
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:48.920]  depression goes up during the winter people get more colds during the winter
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:54.960]  because you're not getting the sun it's common sense sun sun sun and yes the
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:00.320]  sun will end up killing you but you'll statistically die earlier if you don't
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:06.360]  get it we're designed to die our skins designed to burn off it's designed to
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:11.400]  get old and the point is it's designed like a leaf to take in the sun we're
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:16.600]  pretty similar to plants in many ways I appreciate your call okay and trees are
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:22.760]  meant to die too that's just how it is but we are folks do you know why white
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:27.840]  people are white because I sage man lived in areas where they got less light
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:34.920]  show the eyes are blue to absorb more light scientific fact that's why
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:44.800]  cultures that are closer to the to the equator tend to not have as well it's
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:49.680]  it's you know like the Asian name for Europeans round eye I sage people are
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.720]  supposed to have eyes that are more open and blue to get the light and they've
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:57.720]  got white skin to get as much of it as they can now if you're in the equator
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:02.760]  and you're getting too much sun you get melanin so that it protects you and the
[02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:06.440]  melanin blocks it before it gets into the rest of your tissue I don't want to go
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:09.360]  off into a long guy tribe yes sir you're absolutely right Richard good to
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:15.760]  hear from you Jordan in Texas you're on the air go ahead we missed you over the
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:19.280]  more day we can give him a more day weekend you know I actually did take
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:23.800]  off pretty much three days which is a rarity usually when I take off it's to
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:29.440]  go do work and it was it was wonderful to take off and relax and you know read my
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:35.040]  three-year-old 30 40 books a day so it was it was really fun to just run around
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:42.840]  the yard and hang out with the kids but anyway I wanted to get to a point with
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:47.440]  telling you is when you went in protest the last week at Austin I wish I could
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:50.760]  have gone but here in the Metroplex I can't but I'm doing my own things go
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:54.640]  around to all my state representatives and handing them out your five
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:57.680]  essential DVDs I'm making like several copies of them to give into them and
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.920]  I've painted out copies of the 10 facts that prove the the law and table of the
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:08.120]  drop so I'm giving that to my senator as well so they can get that also a funny
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:12.560]  story is a few weeks ago I was at the store and there's this kid young man
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:17.080]  selling a clean energy and so I was talking to him I said so what's your
[02:16:17.080 --> 02:16:22.240]  clean energy is something said well stuff as opposed to coal energy because
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:27.000]  that's bad why is it bad he thinks it produces carbon dioxide I said and what
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.120]  do we exhale and he looked at me through it like you haven't been asked that
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:37.240]  question before said carbon dioxide and then I said which plants he said absorb
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:43.680]  I said so how is the coal energy bad he said oh well it's of course he kind of
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:46.080]  stumped I'll tell you what I'll give you a DVD so I gave him the Obama
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:51.880]  deception but uh that's pretty much that that's what I've been doing anyway that's
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:56.280]  awesome and you know they turn us into mercenaries they set up an economy with
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:59.640]  all the government grants and tax incentives where even if you don't
[02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:05.080]  believe you know and all this quack stuff they're pushing you get into it
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:08.700]  because that's the only economy that's there just like you go to the
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:13.880]  universities it's law enforcement it's environmental assessment you know it's
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:18.400]  all these busy body minder jobs and then that's the only scholarships you can
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:24.400]  get Jordan good to hear from you Tony in Missouri are on the air short time
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:29.200]  listener but I just wanted to let you know that I just got the poison in the
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:33.400]  tap water t-shirt and we definitely need to start waking people up here more in
[02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:37.840]  the Missouri region I haven't heard much callers from Missouri and I'm just
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.600]  very scared and I just wanted to give my gratitude to you and we're going down
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:47.720]  fighting thank you well thank you but Tony don't be scared be glad that you
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:51.560]  now know about what's happening in the world and take action and educate
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:56.480]  folks speaking of fluoride in major cities all over the U.S. Canada and
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:00.640]  Europe and a lot of small towns as well logo Vista a month ago outside Austin
[02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:06.240]  are removing fluoride from their water systems Calgary just did it and it's
[02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.800]  because doctors and scientists go to them and show them the facts the EPA has
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:14.840]  been forced now to say that they're going to cut the amount of fluoride put
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:19.520]  in tap water by half and that children under five shouldn't brush with fluoride
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:25.680]  and that it and that fluoride needs to be banned in use as a pesticide yes you
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:29.760]  heard me right fluoride is one of the most common pesticides you use for rats
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:35.400]  roaches but also for spraying on crops they have a liquid version they spray on
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:40.480]  crops you add it to your irrigation system that's be topically sprayed I'm
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:45.040]  driving to the country and you see those big giant wheels and big long sprayers
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:50.920]  that that that that roll across entire giant fields they can add fluoride to
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:55.540]  that and it sprays and kills the bugs you spray that on a bug it kills them
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:19:00.560]  now you're gonna drink that and then they also have a gas a fluoride gas that
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:05.920]  they gas in those big silos you see in the country where all the farmers come
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:10.280]  and you know weigh their rice weigh their wheat weigh their corn weigh their
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:14.000]  soybeans whatever you know right by the railroad tracks see those giant silos
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:21.080]  they weigh it they dump it the co-op person pays them for their crop and
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:27.080]  then a train pulls up and picks it up okay and then it gets shipped off to the
[02:19:27.080 --> 02:19:33.640]  factories that are you know producing the produced food the processed food now
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.440]  what do you think's going on inside all of those grain silos many of which are
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:43.720]  a hundred years old there's rats there's weevils there's everything else you can
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:49.000]  imagine how do they when the train starts coming into town you know they
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:53.400]  know when the pickups coming how do they knock them out they nerve gas them
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:59.320]  with fluoride gas well it turns out massive residue that precipitates out
[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:05.000]  into what you're eating food prices are spiraling out of control in order to
[02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:09.080]  survive you will soon need to produce some or all of your own food in your

[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:26.040]  couple pieces of information number one I ran into a group of like 21 year olds
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:30.160]  and was talking to them and one of them was ex-military and he's going on about
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:34.160]  operations and projects that he knew about and I started talking to him and

[02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:47.360]  and other sources he was blown away and he called his friends and they all came
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:51.960]  over and again making a long story short we're gonna have a little pow wow here
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:57.720]  and I think I'm gonna get them started out with the the Jason Burmese video
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:03.840]  there the first one he made invisible Empire or loose change yeah the loose
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.880]  change is good but Burmese's first film he made on his own but working with Aaron
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:16.840]  was fabled enemies yeah and also I was listening to you talk yesterday and you
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:22.120]  mentioned cell phones today and you can verify this for yourself I had a cell
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:26.360]  phone years ago and I was waiting for my plan to expire so I could upgrade to
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:31.320]  Bluetooth and when I went in because I'm aware of the cell phone and the the
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:36.000]  tumors and I always use speakerphone but I wanted to upgrade the Bluetooth
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:41.120]  because I can't hold the phone for long and I asked him outright if the same
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:46.480]  cellular technology that's used to power the cell phone is in those Bluetooth
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:52.360]  headsets he said yes and I'm like so I can get cancer from this Bluetooth head
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:56.520]  set just as easy and he said yeah and I went from my research depending on which
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:01.560]  Bluetooth type I believe the guy was ignorant they generally use a little
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:05.400]  radio transmission link at least in that some of the units I've had as I've
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:10.160]  looked it up I know there are some that might use a microwave relay but those
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:14.400]  are more expensive they always like to use whatever's cheaper I know they say
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:18.640]  one of the safest things to use is a wire down to it but then other studies
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:23.560]  show that can be a conduit for the microwave radiation to go up it so it's
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:28.680]  six one way half a dozen the other cell phones are movie dangerous movie bad
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:34.000]  they're a microwave a powerful microwave communicator and they're shooting a
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:41.440]  signal upwards of 10 miles no kidding and and again folks there are thousands
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:46.600]  of studies they knew this back in the 70s they knew it in the 60s sorry go
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.880]  ahead that's okay you know this is I didn't know I figured you were doing
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:54.280]  your own homework but information is free and people can eat the meat and spit
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:59.640]  out the bones and and you know I just I won't I won't even put one near my head
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:06.040]  I just I'm calling paranoid or crazy but if you know it's it's just out there I
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:08.920]  heard you say that I didn't know if you know you're absolutely right and the way
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:15.560]  engineers have described it to me is it's like well well I've seen the math on
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:25.080]  it let's say you see a UHF VHF TV tower or AM FM tower whatever the antenna is
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:33.480]  and with AM that'll be the whole tower generally it has its maximum RF effect
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:38.220]  for the length of the tower and then every time you go out that distance it
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:43.400]  loses half its strength as a general rule of thumb and so if you got a cell
[02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:49.600]  phone in your lap it's radiating your thighs your genitals your your organs
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:54.960]  your skin and it does go in especially the microwave systems the newer ones
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:59.640]  they've gone in the last decade or so and it vibrates DNA at the exact proper
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:04.280]  frequency to break up DNA strands it's just like a microwave how does a
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:08.520]  microwave you throw a piece of pizza in from last night boom into the microwave
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:14.280]  you hit 30 seconds boom you step back 30 seconds later it's molten cheese how
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:20.720]  does that work how does that happen well the microwaves go into the molecules
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:24.800]  and cause them to jump around to move and it rubs them against each other
[02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:30.000]  causing friction well what do you think a microwave does year after year up
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.160]  against your head you can pull it up the average cell phone they're all they
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:39.400]  vary within 15 minutes a cell phone against the head raises the brain
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:46.120]  tissue on the other side of the skull by one degree it's so powerful it's
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:53.160]  actually cooking your brain we'll be right back we're on the march the

[02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:08.520]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:12.760]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:17.040]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:21.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:25.520]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:30.040]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:34.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:38.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:41.960]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:44.680]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:19.120]  that's right folks you ain't seen nothing yet we are intensifying our fight
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:24.080]  against the globalist I'm getting more researchers more video editors we're
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:29.280]  ready to launch the new TV show for prison planet TV viewers five days a
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:35.240]  week for development and in shopping for different cable and TV networks you
[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:38.640]  notice Glenn Beck's now going to our model leaving mainline TV and starting
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:43.080]  his own internet channel and subscriber channel we that's been my plan for five
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:47.440]  years I'm finally to that point now I've just got to have the additional crew
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:53.600]  members to be able to pull it off we're expanding now with new stuff every day
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:34:04.880]  at prison planet dot TV new reports just in the last week we have the new many
[02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:08.760]  film well it's over an hour the secret history of Western education the
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:13.160]  scientific destruction of minds that's up at prison planet dot TV deadly
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:18.800]  fluoride hoax on the run with Dr. Paul Conant and Alex Jones and coming tomorrow
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:25.920]  and let me tell you Rob Jacobson's has spent four months off and on part time
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:30.560]  but more than four months actually editing this and getting every quote in
[02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:34.680]  every document and I mean you want proof of their plan to exterminate their
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:38.600]  plan for world government how they're poisoning the food water and air coming
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:43.720]  tomorrow to prison planet dot TV Webster Tarpley and the elites plan for global
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:50.680]  extermination so this is updated in game and I mean it will it is it is
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:56.400]  absolute proof in their own words across the spectrum UN John P. Holdren
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:02.640]  Club of Rome it is devastating and I told him I said we only spend a few weeks
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:06.400]  on these special reports I fly you guys all over the country turn them out and
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.280]  Jacobson's like look I want to take extra time on this I I want to get put it
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:15.260]  all in there I said okay go ahead so this is a big in prison planet dot TV
[02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:21.680]  15 cents a day 595 a month get a yearly membership and get three months free on
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:26.200]  that I got a bunch of cell phone news coming up and a bunch of economic news
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:30.600]  but I want to continue with your phone calls right now these callers just bring
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:37.760]  up such incredible information let's go ahead and talk to who's up next there
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:43.280]  John Dwayne in California you're on the air go ahead hey Alex nice to talk to
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:47.080]  you brother I stalked you my friend had been info worth for about 10 years now
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:50.640]  and I'm African-American here in Los Angeles and I've been trying to figure
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:54.080]  out a way to wake up other folks and tell them what's going on one of the
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:58.080]  problems I run into though is some of the groups in this inside the Patriot
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:02.440]  movement are seem to be a little racist and it's kind of hard to me to get
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:06.360]  people to move to that camp where do you see black people fitting into the whole
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:10.240]  Patriot movement and how can we eliminate some of those barriers so we can
[02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:15.280]  get more people to the fold well I mean here's the issue the mainstream media
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:22.720]  advertises I mean such a complex question Dwayne I mean I can spend five
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:26.000]  hours just on this issue in fact I've thought I've talked about doing a film
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:35.400]  just on this issue everybody at some level is discriminatory whether you
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:38.600]  want to you know marry somebody that looks like you just because that's what
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:41.480]  you're comfortable around black people white people it's all there
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:47.000]  statistically people act the same I mean I mean humans are all the same so
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.800]  they're always going to be black racist groups white racist groups you know I
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:58.880]  call it tribalism because well the system knows that so they also
[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:03.120]  accentuate and push that and I'm not gonna say there aren't white folks that
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:09.240]  hate black people and vice versa but how many white supremacist rallies where
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:12.200]  they also talk about how their anti-New World Order have turned out to be fed
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:17.240]  run not fed infiltrated fed run how many racist talk show hosts as it turned
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:20.960]  out our government agents are on the payroll I've noticed this on my video
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:25.600]  sometimes you'll see somebody on the Obama deception one version with nine
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:30.360]  million views right at nine million views of the 30 plus million of just on
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  YouTube and Google the folks watching it and they'll say yeah you know look at
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:38.920]  this blah blah blah talking about Obama and you know using racial terms instead
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:42.200]  of going after Obama for being a globalist in a New World Order person
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:47.440]  and to make a long story short here because like I said it's such a complex
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:50.760]  issue and to try to cover every angle see my problem is I don't just give
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:56.040]  sound bites I like to get into deep meat and potatoes to really explain it for
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:59.640]  people because when I explain it it's just common sense people have already
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:03.920]  experienced this themselves they're not learning anything from me I'm pointing
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:08.880]  out what you already knew but what I've noticed is with IP addresses on
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:16.800]  info wars.com in the comments with stuff on YouTube looking at their at their
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:22.800]  user pages most of the people that run around 24-7 and are on 12-hour shifts
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:28.560]  going inward inward inward I love Alex Jones let's kill the inwards or vice
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:33.720]  versa you can notice that they'll have two or three channels that have the same
[02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:39.000]  videos the same terms and it's the same person now now I've suspected that on
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:43.200]  YouTube and seen some evidence of it and I've checked their handle versus their
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:48.720]  Myspace and their Facebook and have confirmed their Pentagon sent com their
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:52.680]  ADL Southern Poverty Law Center affiliated people remember with Rand Paul
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:56.880]  they caught them four separate times Democratic operatives dressed up like
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:02.680]  hillbillies saying I don't like black people now they've caught people in New
[02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:06.440]  Mexico saying get the black people and you can look at them until they were
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:09.920]  little communist slash anarchist it's an oxymoron but that's what they say they
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:17.520]  are foundation funded I mean it's basically like in 2008 the police had
[02:39:17.520 --> 02:39:21.120]  to admit they attacked their own police in front of news cameras to attack the
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:25.480]  peaceful demonstrators at the DNC the the royal amount of police got caught the
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:30.720]  same year in Canada at a North American Union summit SPP summit they've been
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:33.920]  caught in Seattle they've been caught in London they've been caught in in
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:39.520]  Genoa Italy it's the same thing you go out you do something bad to blame a
[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:44.320]  group you don't like now it is true going back 34 years that if somebody's
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:47.680]  going to be a white supremacist well they're not going to care about talking
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:51.520]  about the New World Order either because they're politically incorrect so that
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:56.840]  there are some real folks who want to be white separatist and got beat up by a
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:40:00.760]  mug by black folks once or whatever so they don't like all black people just
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:04.440]  like they're plenty of black people I grew up in Dallas where I'd be on the
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:07.360]  weekend playing basketball you know with some of my black friends from the
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:10.840]  football team and an old black man come out on his porch with a shotgun and said
[02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:14.720]  look honky you get out of the neighborhood or I'm gonna kill you now
[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:18.280]  that's happened to me repeatedly I told my dad about me said well maybe it's best
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:23.560]  you don't go down there I mean so so that's the whole issue I don't then say
[02:40:23.560 --> 02:40:27.400]  well all black people want to kill me because some old black man said look
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:32.120]  look you cracker honky get you know get the bleep out of here I'm gonna you know
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:38.800]  I'm gonna do something to you and and and you know then I don't run around and
[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:44.520]  say all black people I mean I've been racially attacked by black people in
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:49.720]  Dallas several times and I thought it was great I mean you know gave me one
[02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:55.240]  hell of a fight I'm a lot tougher person now a day you know and and so that's
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:59.080]  the end of it and that's because the black folks feel like they've been put
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:03.760]  down they've been put in a bad position they've been abused and so all white
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:07.600]  people are evil so I deserve to be called racial names well it's the same
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:13.240]  thing with black people with white people because I mean white racist don't
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:17.120]  sit there and think they're bad and hateful they think all blacks are evil
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:23.320]  and and a racist and they deserve it so see the black racist is looking back at
[02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:27.280]  the white racist and they're basically the same person they just got different
[02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:32.520]  melanin in their skin and the system plays up on that so a lot of it is hype
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:36.680]  in the Liberty Movement but I've confirmed it in full wars and prison
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:41.880]  planning and we have almost no moderation we have stuff that can be flagged we
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:45.960]  have a few folks at night one person at night one person in the day if they see
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:49.320]  stuff like kill this person kill that person because I don't want the cops
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:53.680]  showing up here you know we delete it and if I see somebody saying inward
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:57.520]  inward over and over again you know we delete them because it's just spam it's
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:01.840]  like if somebody's pitching their porn website hey go here for you know hot
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:06.760]  girls we ban that IP address but it's mainly just the super bad nuisances
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:11.040]  that we have to deal with now then we also have WordPress problems so sometimes
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:14.840]  I can't even post because the sites are so big and people think that censorship
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:20.400]  but the point is we made a study of the IP addresses and nine times out of ten the
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.400]  guy going inward inward inward inward kill all the blacks and then and there's
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:28.280]  another guy in there going going kill all the whites they're devil people it's
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:33.400]  the same guy the same group of IP addresses will ban them they come
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:37.640]  right back I don't know they're white black Jewish German Chinese who knows
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:42.160]  could be a computer doing it they admit the Pentagon has these quote sock puppet
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.760]  programs now that can do it Israel admittedly has a thing called super
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:48.880]  megaphone where they've got hundreds of thousands of volunteers that go out
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:53.200]  stir folks up government admits they're doing it corporations admit they're
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:58.240]  doing it I don't know if it's a person or what but it's in there just inward
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:03.880]  inward inward inward if we've got an article about Obama being bad this
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:09.240]  individual or computer or whatever it is or group goes in with the same IP
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:17.200]  address or the same area of IP addresses and wreaks havoc to and and and they'll
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:22.680]  wait on the articles they'll wait till one goes live so they can try to control
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:26.760]  the argument and most of them are not stalkers or lunatics or idiots they are
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:34.840]  paid to do it so my whole issue is if Newsweek Time magazine CNN Nightline
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:41.000]  Rolling Stone New York magazine anything else you can imagine comes out and
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:47.440]  demonizes Alex Jones and tries to then mix in racial stuff to it I mean let's
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:52.440]  say white supremacist we're running around saying don't drink fluoride it
[02:43:52.440 --> 02:43:56.200]  causes brain damage well if you're black who cares if they're telling you that
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:44:00.400]  it's true but you notice the white supremacist aren't in fact if you really
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:04.600]  study the main white supremacist groups because I would guess 98% or Fed run we
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:08.600]  and that's been proven over time that the most of them are they spend more time
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:14.400]  on Alex Jones universally then they do attack in Benjamin yet in Yahoo you'd
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:18.840]  think if the Jews are the ultimate devil in the universe that they would be
[02:44:18.840 --> 02:44:24.560]  attacking Benjamin yet in Yahoo if it's all run by him no almost no time on
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:30.760]  Israel it's on Alex Jones it's because I'm here covering issues and regardless of
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:34.600]  what color you are you should have farming and ranching rights you should
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:38.720]  have family rights you should have tax incentives for small business you
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:44.440]  shouldn't be aborting your babies you know I'm here about life I like life and
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:50.280]  so but at the same time I don't have any guilt about racial stuff because in my
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.520]  life I never did anything to a Mexican nothing to a black person and I've been
[02:44:54.520 --> 02:45:00.240]  racially attacked repeatedly by Mexicans had my leg broken for no reason I've
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:05.160]  been racially attacked by black folks but I don't then hate Mexicans because
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:09.360]  that happened now when Mexicans run around waving Mexican flags I go well
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:13.200]  you're an idiot don't you want to be in America it's better than Mexico it ain't
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:17.200]  perfect but if it's so good why do you want this be Mexico you see so at the
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:25.000]  same time I'm not psychologically stunted in guilt where where I'm so sick
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:31.480]  of the fake guilt I'm tempted sometimes a psychological example to come in here
[02:45:31.480 --> 02:45:35.400]  wearing a clan uniform and then tell black people don't abort your babies
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:39.720]  see because then that would get probably five million views and would
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:45.840]  probably save 10,000 black children and I'm not above degrading myself to save
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:49.480]  human lives I mean and you say why how would that do that oh I guarantee you
[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:52.800]  get five ten million views and black folks would actually watch it and not
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:57.120]  kill their babies you see what I'm saying that's why I dress up like a
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:04.880]  Joker if that's what it takes to expose Obama as a fraud okay see see as long as
[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:08.920]  somebody comes to you as a liberal and tells you we want to ban folks calling
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:12.560]  you names and take their free speech folks are like good abort my babies
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:20.680]  because you're my friend you you tell me you like me you see but see if I put a
[02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:24.320]  pair of sunglasses on right now everybody on the YouTube videos later
[02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:31.840]  would would would marvel and ask me why I was wearing sunglasses if I wore
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.400]  sunglasses for a three-hour show every caller who was watching on the internet
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:40.760]  would call and ask why are you wearing sunglasses do you have a black eye see
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:46.360]  everybody's about surface stuff and so the globalists come to you as liberals
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:50.960]  dressed up like hippies when they're who when they are writing their thesis
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:54.600]  papers at universities about how your black weeds and they want to kill you
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:58.960]  but because they come to you with a lisping NPR voice you'll open your
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:05.640]  wrist up and say drink my blood you understand I mean I had a famous black
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:08.160]  nationalist down here a few months ago because I wanted to interview him for an
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:11.840]  upcoming film and I said don't you understand that abortion is about
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:15.440]  exterminating blacks they said I don't care I'm for it and I go well you're not
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:21.280]  really then this black nationalist are you see it's a sacrament to kill the
[02:47:21.280 --> 02:47:26.200]  black babies blacks think it's a it's a right just like whites do even though
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:32.800]  52% of blacks were never born so see the average black person would get upset by
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:37.280]  somebody dressed up in a clan outfit even though they were saying sodium
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:41.920]  fluoride has on average four times the effect on blacks for whatever reason
[02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:47.440]  neurologically as it does on whites those are in major studies we've had
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:50.920]  doctors in to break it down I'm gonna have to go into overdrive now I'm running
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:53.680]  out of time there I've got important stuff I promise to cover so you've got
[02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:57.640]  all that happening yeah I said I couldn't answer this slowly so is so if
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:01.880]  somebody's in a hippie outfit with a black beret on you're ready to kill your
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:06.920]  kids for him but if somebody's wearing a clan outfit but tried to give you a bag
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:11.200]  of gold you wouldn't take it because it's all the surface so the feds dress up
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:15.160]  in clan outfits and dance around to demonize the First Amendment and
[02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:19.840]  Patriot and Tenth Amendment groups hoping to fool people into then fighting
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:25.200]  with real patriots it's all theater now now I've been ranting there Dwayne I
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:29.200]  hope that answered your question thank you very much but I mean do you get my
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:35.240]  point about about that if somebody comes up dressed like a hippie people will do
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:39.240]  whatever they say but if they came dressed giving you a lottery ticket for
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:42.560]  ten million dollars in a clan outfit people wouldn't trust it even though
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:46.840]  it's just an outfit do you see the feds can dress up in those outfits and then
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:50.480]  demonize whatever group they want you understand that I get it I get it I've
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:53.280]  been in for work for ten years is the other folks out there who are thick headed
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:57.080]  who don't understand that had to have you break it down for them so I appreciate
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:00.760]  it well I hope they wake up I hope everybody wakes up because the
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:05.640]  government wants what they've done to black folks in this country with breaking
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:08.920]  up the family telling the women will give you money but no man in the house
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:15.760]  all of that on record was to destroy any type of continuity and strength but
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:20.720]  but but they always beta test on a group that's a minority first before it goes
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:26.040]  to everybody else so my issue is a rising tide does raise all ships and
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:31.080]  black folks white folks polka dotted folks had better learn right now that
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:35.520]  Uncle Sam is not their friend because Uncle Sam is not Uncle Sam Uncle Sam is
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:39.000]  a group of eugenics scientists that taught Hitler everything he knows do
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:47.480]  you see what I'm saying they do they do it right now and people need to stop
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:52.640]  fighting with each other and obsessing over all this and and and need to deal
[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:57.080]  with the mega central banks I appreciate your call how I'm ever gonna get to all

[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:19.360]  this study says a 50 minute cell phone call on the right side they did brain
[02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:24.560]  scan images relations show heightened activity in the area of the brain and
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:28.280]  it increased the temperature of the brain I've seen other studies that say
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:33.280]  15 minutes but it all it all matters it's all based on how powerful that cell
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:40.800]  phone is here's another one woozy from y5 electro sensitive say modern life

[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:42.640]  MSNBC linked up on info wars.com it's happening it's all been designed to
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:47.000]  consolidate wealth it's all been planned they've announced the world government
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  the system is out in the open it's time to stop living in denial government
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.240]  lies even when it's would be better for them to tell the truth because it's
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:01.320]  their nature and they don't ever want to get in the habit of telling the truth
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:07.800]  so why do we trust them it's just that simple they knew cell phones caused
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:14.400]  massive brain tumors and they approved it back in the late 70s they know what
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:18.360]  they're doing they know what all this Wi-Fi and all this frequency pollution
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:22.080]  is doing they're conscious of it the globalist the Queen of England others
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:25.360]  I've seen mainline documentaries on them they allow none of this in their
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:29.920]  palaces none of this everything they eat organic everything they drink is
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:34.280]  purified water they're obsessed with it while they own the companies that are
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:39.280]  approving all of this we're all in this together and we've got to wake up to it
[02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:44.960]  Habu in Wisconsin you're on the air go ahead good afternoon and thank you so
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:51.920]  much for this great opportunity I'll be pithy and just two quick points one you
[02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:57.080]  know it's so interesting that the cell phone report came out now and this was
[02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:01.640]  obviously they knew as you said they knew about these kinds of things going on
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:07.360]  but they waited till the population is so dependent on cell phones and then they
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:12.000]  come out with this kind of equivocation oh but if you use it this way or that way
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:17.960]  as if you know yes it's bad but you can still get it get by with using it and so
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:21.680]  it's all designed as you said and the second thing you know I had a discussion
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:26.840]  with a station manager I mentioned your name and he said oh the conspiracy
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:31.400]  theorist and I took him to I took him to task on that I said what do you mean
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:35.680]  conspiracy theorist I said and and precisely what is happening which is
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:41.040]  what you point out is that these are giant conspiracies that a mainline a
[02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:45.760]  media just dismisses as a conspiracy theorist but these are actually
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:50.440]  happening like Pat Tillman etc etc including the economy numbers as Gerald
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:54.120]  Salenta has said so that is all and I wish you all the very best in your new
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:59.960]  ventures because it's so important to reach the people and have a complete
[02:56:59.960 --> 02:57:04.960]  change coming up next year well how boo I mean I mean how did this end I mean 90
[02:57:04.960 --> 02:57:09.320]  plus percent of what we talk about I mean I've been telling people for 15 16
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:12.880]  years on air that cell phones cost brain tumors because I had the studies I
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:17.600]  wasn't just saying that I've been telling people for 16 years that blood is
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:22.200]  taken from all babies at birth secretly declassified two years ago 14 years
[02:57:22.200 --> 02:57:26.280]  after I got documents and exposed it I said they would implode the economy and
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:31.440]  announce a new Bank of the World they've now done that I mean it goes on and on
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:36.160]  and on I mean we're not making any of this up I mean most of this stuff is
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:45.880]  out in the open now I mean what did he say to that you know he gave me this
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:50.840]  typical liberal answer he was from a liberal radio station and he gave me
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:58.440]  this answer about about conspiracy theories and you know that is a way
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:04.760]  that the mainstream media just dismisses something that's very real and and and
[02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:08.880]  most people don't have the time to look at it as you have in depth and
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:12.800]  completely deconstructed it thank you for your call you're absolutely right

[03:00:41.720 --> 03:00:46.640]  if questioning is a conspiracy theory or saying that powerful people get
[03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:50.880]  together and try to expand their power and do it through government to say
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:55.640]  that's a conspiracy theory is the height of ignorance or if you're lying if

[03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:02.920]  Kristen Louisiana thanks for holding it on the air
[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:08.760]  can you hear me yes sir hey I just wanted to say man I'm a 40-year-old father
[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:13.520]  of two beautiful boys five-year-old and the three-year-old and what bothers me
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:16.920]  most man I could talk about everything going on in the world I listen to you
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:23.800]  every day but it's like what matters most to me is like a food shelter and
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:27.200]  protection right and they're just stripping all those away with the
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:32.400]  the Indiana Supreme Court saying they can come anytime with or without any
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:36.760]  reason to come in destroy the fourth amendment then I can't protect myself
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:41.720]  right to bear arms now slaughter in the second amendment and then the food
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:47.560]  thing it's like just getting really dire and it's a and first they say the the
[03:01:47.560 --> 03:01:51.840]  principle can't say a prayer graduation now you can't get up there as valor
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:56.240]  Victorian the judges are ruling and say I want to thank God you can have
[03:01:56.240 --> 03:02:00.120]  whatever other free speech you want but now you don't have your free speech
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:03.720]  because you go to a government school that is ridiculous and they know it's a
[03:02:03.720 --> 03:02:09.840]  fraud I just want to have my house for my family and my food and be able to
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.400]  protect them in the most basic rudimentary human kind of way and I feel
[03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:19.120]  like the that's hard to do these days you know well that's what the founding
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:22.880]  fathers got angry about and they petitioned and they begged and they
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:26.640]  rallied and the redcoats said we're gonna start searching your houses without
[03:02:26.640 --> 03:02:30.680]  warrants and we're coming to get your guns and you know what happened so Chris
[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:34.200]  we've got to wake up as many people as we can as we go into these dangerous
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:38.520]  waters because history is being made right now and I understand what it's
[03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:41.840]  like to have children to look into their innocent eyes and to only want to
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:46.240]  protect them and that's why I don't have any fear of these globalist so I'm not
[03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:50.080]  worried about what happens to my name my body any of it because it's not just my
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:53.320]  children as every other child there isn't one of us out there that's got
[03:02:53.320 --> 03:02:56.160]  our head screwed on straight that wouldn't give our life not just for our
[03:02:56.160 --> 03:03:00.600]  own children but for somebody else's child and it's that type of instinct that
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:05.320]  builds civilization this backstabbing yuppie attitude of giggling at
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:09.720]  everything and being passive that destroys civilization and lets criminal
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:14.440]  wolves come in and take over Tony in Alabama you're on the air go ahead I
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:19.920]  appreciate you taking my call the reason I'm calling today is talk about the
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:24.600]  police-style state bill being voted on this week in the Alabama State Senate
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:30.080]  and it really hits home to me because I am a state constable and also part of
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:35.240]  the Ron Paul meetup group and we also watch bills up in Montgomery with a
[03:03:35.240 --> 03:03:38.760]  organization called be somebody mobile and we'll go up there and we'll watch
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:42.760]  these bills as they go through and a couple of weeks ago we were up there in
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:46.360]  committee watching this particular bill going through it's a texting while
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:50.840]  driving bill and what got me really concerned about they got the same one in
[03:03:50.840 --> 03:03:55.560]  Texas they say that they're gonna grab your phone now download the info that
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:04:00.360]  if you receive a text I know tech that you'll be charged with it and now all I
[03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:04.120]  have a CNN article everywhere that the government saying anything on your phone
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:08.280]  is theirs well that's your computer sorry go ahead is that what it is yeah now
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:11.560]  that's it's a texting while driving bill way it's coming in you know to kind of
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:14.920]  fool people and believe in this thing is gonna be you know for their safety but
[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:19.520]  we examine the bill and it actually does not forbid a driver from reading his
[03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:24.600]  his phone is text they can play games on their phone while they're driving that's
[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:31.480]  not gonna you know they also allow them to use maps and the most important thing
[03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:38.720]  is they can't this bill does not cover if you're actually dialing a number while
[03:04:38.720 --> 03:04:42.640]  you're driving this is still important more overdrive straight ahead stay there

[03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:25.200]  calls the last caller raised the fact that all over the country they're trying
[03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:29.960]  to pass texting bills and and look it is dangerous in many studies show it's
[03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:33.320]  three times more dangerous to be texting while driving than drinking while
[03:08:33.320 --> 03:08:38.320]  driving I mean it's dangerous just to get a text and look at it but here's a
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:43.120]  CNN headline warrantless cell phone searches spread to more states and what
[03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:49.040]  happens is they arrest you for unpaid parking tickets or in Michigan they just
[03:08:49.040 --> 03:08:53.640]  pull you over for speeding they grab your cell phone plug it into an extractor
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:58.600]  they also have wireless systems that can do this the feds do and it downloads
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:05.440]  photos videos text call log voicemail calendar items and all goes into a
[03:09:05.440 --> 03:09:11.920]  database and CNN reports it like it's a good thing and that now when you get
[03:09:11.920 --> 03:09:17.480]  arrested and are in the back of a squad car including for unpaid tickets they go
[03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:21.000]  ahead and take your phone I mean obviously ladies and gentlemen your
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:27.240]  phone is your computer your phone has everything on you about it especially if
[03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:30.280]  it's the smart phone and now even the cheap phones are becoming smart phones
[03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:34.000]  they're already surveilling you without warrants it says think about all the data
[03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:39.280]  photos video text messages calendar items apps call log voicemail email on
[03:09:39.280 --> 03:09:43.000]  your cell phone right now if you're arrested could the police search your
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:47.560]  cell phone and would they need a warrant that depends on which state you're in
[03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:51.640]  in California it's legal for police to search an arrestee cell phone without a
[03:09:51.640 --> 03:09:57.320]  warrant you hear that for any arrest ever since a January decision by the
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:00.800]  California Supreme Court California civil rights advocates are pushing back
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:04.520]  the Electronic Frontier Foundation great folks are supporting a California
[03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:09.720]  assembly bill SB 914 which would require police in the state to get a warrant
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:13.440]  before searching arrestee cell phone it'd be one thing if you had probable
[03:10:13.440 --> 03:10:18.000]  cause arrested somebody for a dead body in the back of the car clearly you want
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:21.720]  to know the person's got more bodies at their house or people kidnapped that
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:27.680]  there's no warrant needed probable cause search that sucker right there but to
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:32.280]  grab a phone and it goes on to admit Michigan anybody pulled over does this
[03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:37.160]  they grab your phone plug it in within seconds it grabs within seconds it
[03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:41.480]  breaks in within a minute it grabs everything they go have a nice day
[03:10:41.480 --> 03:10:45.600]  thanks for all your info then that's put into big data hoppers well why shouldn't
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:48.560]  the local cops do that the feds are already running basically everything
[03:10:48.560 --> 03:10:53.000]  through these NSA hubs which again they denied a few years ago they did now they
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:57.800]  admit and the whole cybersecurity system has got the Pentagon with the more
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:04.720]  hubs going in to go through everybody's data so going back to the caller the
[03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:10.000]  caller is a constable Tony in Alabama and we'll talk to a few other callers
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:14.240]  and he he was getting to a bill a texting bill and talking about it being
[03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:18.920]  horrible and he hadn't gotten to why it was horrible I haven't read the Texas
[03:11:18.920 --> 03:11:24.560]  bill but I heard them reading sections of it on local talk radio yesterday on
[03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:29.400]  590 a.m. in the morning and they were reading sections saying that even if you
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:35.160]  receive a text that the cop now without a warrant we'll go through and see that
[03:11:35.160 --> 03:11:38.440]  you got a text then and then you'll get a ticket for that and then it's going to
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:45.040]  be a thousand dollars in Austin and only 200 outside Austin very bizarre so it'll
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:49.320]  vary area to area but again I haven't researched it yet I just for 30 minutes
[03:11:49.320 --> 03:11:54.040]  heard him talking about it I don't know about this Alabama bill Tony you say
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:57.480]  you're up at the state house is a constable watching all this what is
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:02.120]  your concern with the Alabama bill well my concern is this it's I think it's
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:07.800]  just a way of abusing police power in the bill you know they're trying to
[03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:13.400]  push it as a safety bill but it actually it does it does not forbid a driver
[03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:17.160]  from reading their text while driving or playing on the phone or anything like
[03:12:17.160 --> 03:12:20.800]  that just let's the cop get into the phone yeah you gotta ask yourself okay
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:25.240]  if the police if this thing passes if a policeman sees you just touching your
[03:12:25.240 --> 03:12:28.680]  phone basically because it doesn't forbid the guy stood up there committee and
[03:12:28.680 --> 03:12:32.720]  said hey you can dial your phone you can call that's fine this bill does not you
[03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:38.240]  know not let you do that you can you can use your your your map service on your
[03:12:38.240 --> 03:12:42.080]  phone but my concern is when I stood out you know I was talking some of the
[03:12:42.080 --> 03:12:45.720]  senators and I said listen how is a police officer like myself supposed to
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:49.240]  know the difference between you dialing somebody dialing home to tell your wife
[03:12:49.240 --> 03:12:54.360]  you coming home earlier pick up some milk or something or texting and and they
[03:12:54.360 --> 03:12:57.720]  just look at you like you're just stupid that was a stupid question and I'm
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:01.760]  like well as a possible I couldn't tell the difference and you're expecting me
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:06.240]  to enforce a law that's unenforceable and so I even taught with some of the
[03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:11.440]  senators afterwards and what really got me bad was one of the senators when I
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:15.120]  was talking to me says well why are you so opposed to this unenforceable law why
[03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:18.880]  can't we just pass this law and I said let me turn that around for you why are
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:22.740]  you trying to pass a law that's unenforceable what is whether you're
[03:13:22.740 --> 03:13:26.200]  trying to get to and why are you wanting to stop people because we're we're
[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:31.560]  here mobile we get stopped at every holiday for no reason down the street
[03:13:31.560 --> 03:13:35.320]  we're really fed up with it with these police stop you know these these where
[03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:39.320]  they stop you make sure you prove that you have insurance they're they're
[03:13:39.320 --> 03:13:42.560]  basically saying you're guilty until you prove to us that you have this
[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:45.920]  interest and now they're trying to start this bill so I'm just telling
[03:13:45.920 --> 03:13:49.880]  everybody now I appreciate you taking my call if they can call the State House
[03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:53.600]  they're in Alabama they're listening to this it has not passed yet but it has
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:56.600]  passed committee and it will be up for vote this week what do you think about
[03:13:56.600 --> 03:14:01.640]  all these states pulling people over not even arresting them some states like
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:05.200]  Michigan they pull you over for speeding and they grab your phone this is on
[03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:10.040]  record and plug it into a machine that sucks everything out of it yeah I think
[03:14:10.040 --> 03:14:14.560]  that's terrible I mean that's going beyond you know the police is a state
[03:14:14.560 --> 03:14:18.800]  gospel half the state loves us okay most all your rural areas where we're
[03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:23.280]  helping people they love it some of your cities in Alabama well we're
[03:14:23.280 --> 03:14:26.720]  infringing on what they're trying to do in their corporate police you know and
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:30.520]  and I'm not putting down the local police here I work with some of them and
[03:14:30.520 --> 03:14:34.040]  let me ask you a question how did we have giant cities with a half million
[03:14:34.040 --> 03:14:38.840]  million people a hundred years ago with only sheriffs and constables because
[03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:42.520]  you only got a sheriff or constable when it was something really serious was
[03:14:42.520 --> 03:14:47.200]  going on everybody else had guns and people were afraid to break in a rob
[03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:51.840]  vote because they would get shot as we get more and more police you notice the
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:57.120]  crime rate doesn't go down because most the cops are busy revenue generating
[03:14:57.120 --> 03:15:02.120]  that's what I think this bill is really trying to do because the penalties for
[03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:05.880]  this is not a thousand dollars they're gonna nickel and dime people to death
[03:15:05.880 --> 03:15:09.960]  so they don't go downtown they don't fight it and they're getting twenty five
[03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:13.280]  dollars fifty dollars you know these are the type finds they're just revenue
[03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:18.560]  generators and another thing the state constable is an elected position too so
[03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:22.880]  if I don't do my job I lose my job no I hear you it's good to hear from you
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:28.080]  Tony another good peace officer out there of course again elected that's
[03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:32.480]  what you want your you want your police elected of course the founding fathers
[03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:35.120]  had it wrong though we want to just have them do whatever they want run in
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:39.640]  wild I don't know what to do about the texting issue I think there needs to be
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:46.320]  serious local penalties if it is confirmed you're doing it for reckless
[03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:49.840]  driving and let me tell you how you know reckless driving a month ago I went
[03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:54.520]  down to Port Aransas to go fishing for the weekend and there was this going
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:16:02.000]  over the causeway out to Mustang Island there was this giant gas truck it had
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:07.400]  natural gas in it swerving in and out of the two lanes and I said that guy's
[03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:11.200]  drunk I said the wind didn't high and my wife's like get around him get away
[03:16:11.200 --> 03:16:15.600]  from him and it was this big 18-wheeler swerving in and out of the lane and I
[03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:20.480]  did call call on him because that's not tattle tailing that's exposing a serious
[03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:26.720]  danger and I didn't call the police I called normally they have a phone number
[03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:29.680]  didn't have a phone every it had the name of the gas company and the truck
[03:16:29.680 --> 03:16:36.120]  number but let me finish the story though I drove around him to get away and
[03:16:36.120 --> 03:16:39.600]  he almost hit me again and he was all over the road I'd say he was coming three
[03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:43.640]  feet the other side and then once we drove past him he was driving violently
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:49.040]  and I called him and I said here's the truck number he's going over the cause
[03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:54.560]  way you know towards Mustang Island Port Aransas but when we drove by him with
[03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:58.560]  him swerving out of the lane he was watching a video or texting I don't know
[03:16:58.560 --> 03:17:02.960]  what he was doing he had the smartphone looked like an iPhone in front of his
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:08.920]  face this guy was driving a truck that's a giant bomb with it in his face it's
[03:17:08.920 --> 03:17:12.320]  one thing if you get a message you know look over real quick but see that leads
[03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:15.600]  to more danger that's how it starts I guess it isn't good he's swerving all
[03:17:15.600 --> 03:17:20.240]  over the road with his gas truck and when we drive by him bigger than Dallas
[03:17:20.240 --> 03:17:24.920]  he's got it in front of his face I mean two inches like it was near-sighted or
[03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:29.280]  something looking at the phone so I don't know what he was doing I don't know
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:34.040]  what that lunatic was doing but I mean he was all over the road worse than any
[03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:41.040]  drunk driver in a giant gas truck and I did call the number on him and I'm not
[03:17:41.040 --> 03:17:43.720]  one of these folks that you know what gravels coming out of a truck so I call
[03:17:43.720 --> 03:17:46.760]  and tattle on them for not having a tarp down or they swerve a little or they
[03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:50.640]  or they get on my tail or something I just ignore it but let me tell you this
[03:17:50.640 --> 03:17:57.480]  guy was out of his mind all right now I'm out of time again Sean in Australia
[03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:04.720]  you're on the air go ahead there you go my um Alex are you there mate yes I am
[03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:08.000]  we got about a minute and a half yeah no worries mate I'm a member of the
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:12.360]  Jinjin property group here in Western Australia and I've um I listened to that
[03:18:12.360 --> 03:18:16.520]  bloke talking the other day from Perth and I just wanted to tell you mate I was
[03:18:16.520 --> 03:18:22.200]  a meeting the other day and um there were dozens of farmers there just been
[03:18:22.200 --> 03:18:28.320]  totally destroyed by these UN laws mate and now that's been on Australian TV but
[03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:32.800]  is it right that half the farming land has been laid off use that land people
[03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:38.800]  own for the carbon tax a good mate of mine had they wanted to take his whole
[03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:45.120]  property and turn it into a park he bought he pays his you know payments
[03:18:45.120 --> 03:18:49.680]  to the bank for his property they're gonna take um his whole land and he
[03:18:49.680 --> 03:18:55.080]  bought it and they only ended up taking 10 acres of him so he was lucky you know
[03:18:55.080 --> 03:19:01.200]  he got away with losing 10 acres but I was just gonna say the reason like that
[03:19:01.200 --> 03:19:05.640]  bloke the other day from Western Australia the Sean bloke he didn't know
[03:19:05.640 --> 03:19:11.280]  about the farming situation and it's like that in Australia our media is so
[03:19:11.280 --> 03:19:19.360]  bad that people are just not told and I myself wrote a went to the Jinjin
[03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:23.400]  property group meeting where all these great Australians were speaking who had
[03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:31.880]  been fighting this these horrible UN laws for years and you know there was no
[03:19:31.880 --> 03:19:40.160]  media there so I had to write a letter to all the local paper and myself and so
[03:19:40.160 --> 03:19:45.000]  the people just are not told mate well listen I'm gonna do this I'm gonna put
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:49.760]  you on hold and and get your name and number and you say you're are you a
[03:19:49.760 --> 03:19:52.640]  farmer or you went to the farmer meeting
[03:19:52.640 --> 03:19:56.720]  well no I'm not a farmer but my family's always been farmer
[03:19:56.720 --> 03:20:00.720]  well we need to get some farmers on give us your name and number recommend some
[03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:18.680]  for us
