[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:30.560]  Texas Alex Jones thank you for joining us today ladies and gentlemen it is
[00:30.560 --> 00:39.280]  Thursday the 16th day of September 2010 we've got Christopher Moncton the third
[00:39.280 --> 00:44.680]  Viscount of a brentially in Moncton he'll be joining us coming up in the
[00:44.680 --> 00:50.120]  second hour today then in the last 30 minutes of the third hour we have Wayne
[00:50.120 --> 00:55.440]  Madsen investigative journalist very well respected of course written for some
[00:55.440 --> 00:59.440]  of the biggest newspapers and magazines in the country and he has a lot of
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.920]  credibility with us pretty shocking information he's got out today black
[01:05.920 --> 01:12.240]  water XC cells conducting false flag terror attacks in Pakistan so we'll try
[01:12.240 --> 01:19.440]  to learn more from him on this amazing information he's put out when he joins
[01:19.440 --> 01:28.880]  us coming up later today there's a article that Kurt Nemo posted up at
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.720]  info wars dot com that really clarified a lot of things for me today it deals
[01:33.720 --> 01:41.880]  with Greenpeace and a ad that they put out a few years ago where they show this
[01:41.880 --> 01:51.600]  young child probably eight nine years old threateningly looking at the camera
[01:51.600 --> 01:57.200]  and he's dressed up kind of like a Sith Lord or something from Star Wars and
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.640]  and then the way they put makeup on him the way they shot it he's meant to be
[02:01.640 --> 02:09.400]  very ominous and look like an adult and of course this is the psychological
[02:09.400 --> 02:16.320]  image that a lot of young males especially aspire to is to be big tough
[02:16.320 --> 02:22.120]  guys and the message is you're either with us or you're against us our
[02:22.120 --> 02:27.320]  parents are basically terrorist if they don't go along with the global carbon
[02:27.320 --> 02:33.280]  taxes and a revolution is here and we're coming for you now since then we've seen
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.960]  Al Gore last year tell high schools and middle schools and different speeches
[02:37.960 --> 02:43.160]  tell your parents what to do boss them around they're not as smart as you they
[02:43.160 --> 02:48.080]  don't understand how serious man-made global warming is basically you've got
[02:48.080 --> 02:52.600]  to give in to our total tyranny or the earth's gonna die and this is such
[02:52.600 --> 02:58.320]  fundamental bedrock super tyranny I mean when you've got the government and its
[02:58.320 --> 03:03.200]  spokesman out there telling children to boss their parents around it doesn't get
[03:03.200 --> 03:08.240]  much worse than that and since then we've seen countless news articles and
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.480]  statements by the environmental leaders and the big central banks that are
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.320]  pushing the carbon tax where they say over and over again that well the
[03:16.320 --> 03:19.880]  public's too dumb to accept the carbon taxes so we've got to do this in an
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.120]  authoritarian way for their own good and we need to start arresting people that
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.240]  criticize man-made global warming or anybody that questions us should be
[03:29.240 --> 03:34.520]  arrested these are outrageous tyrants and it has nothing to do with the
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.560]  environment or the planet or the earth and so I do want to go over that today
[03:38.560 --> 03:41.960]  Paul Watson is going to be publishing in the next hour and a half a detailed
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.000]  report that I worked on with him this morning going over the different facets
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.720]  of this but I will get in to what's going to be in the article coming up at the
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.640]  bottom of this hour before it's published because I want to try to simply
[03:58.640 --> 04:03.840]  and succinctly connect all the dots between the government and the media
[04:03.840 --> 04:07.080]  literally trying to take your children away from you and turn them into
[04:07.080 --> 04:14.120]  Maoist youth brigades to be used against the population and statements by
[04:14.120 --> 04:20.320]  Bill Gates that we need to you know kill one granny so we can hire ten teachers
[04:20.320 --> 04:23.360]  that's another divide and conquer it's the children against the parents it's
[04:23.360 --> 04:28.840]  the young against the old and it's this artificial scarcity paradigm of if
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.440]  you're gonna get ahead you're gonna have to bomb and kill some Iraqis you're
[04:32.440 --> 04:37.400]  gonna have to kill an old lady or if we're gonna save the earth you're gonna
[04:37.400 --> 04:43.400]  have to whip your parents into line very very dangerous and because we've
[04:43.400 --> 04:47.600]  exposed these criminals as the fraudsters they are they're going into high gear
[04:47.600 --> 04:51.560]  right now to start censoring the web cracking down on free speech and I've
[04:51.560 --> 04:55.520]  got a whole separate file here today on attacks on free speech we're gonna

[08:11.960 --> 08:22.240]  okay my friends thank you for joining us on this Thursday edition Lord Christopher
[08:22.240 --> 08:25.840]  Monkton joining us in the next hour then we got Wayne Madsen coming on with
[08:25.840 --> 08:30.680]  the incredible report he's put out Blackwater XC cells conducting false
[08:30.680 --> 08:36.240]  flag attacks inside Pakistan he says he's got first-hand account from an
[08:36.240 --> 08:42.240]  insider and so we'll question him about these claims he has a lot of credibility
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.640]  with us here over the years tracking his reporting but this is really bombshell
[08:46.640 --> 08:53.520]  if it is the case of course British special forces were caught in 2006 this
[08:53.520 --> 08:58.320]  was actually the London Guardian and BBC dressed up as Arabs running around
[08:58.320 --> 09:03.040]  attacking Iraqi police and others and there's been many other cases of where
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.400]  we've caught Western intelligence agencies staging events but the question
[09:08.400 --> 09:12.280]  is our contractors doing this and of course if you have a two trillion dollar
[09:12.280 --> 09:18.400]  roughly overall defense budget 1.1 trillion on budget hundreds and hundreds
[09:18.400 --> 09:22.120]  of billions in secret intelligence 800 billion on average and supplemental
[09:22.120 --> 09:25.880]  funding it's actually over two trillion but roughly around two trillion to be
[09:25.880 --> 09:29.760]  conservative do you think they'll spend a few billion to actually stage events to
[09:29.760 --> 09:34.800]  be able to keep that war going and take over the opium and oil and to have the
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.080]  no-bid weapons contracts spend a few billion for a few trillion you think
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.480]  they do that you think antivirus computer companies are putting out some of the
[09:43.480 --> 09:50.240]  viruses you think the mafia buys insurance on buildings they own and then
[09:50.240 --> 09:59.200]  burns the building down you think the well it's kind of like asking yourself
[09:59.200 --> 10:05.480]  does a duck quack but we're gonna be discussing that coming up today but
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.520]  here's some financial news and I'm gonna get into massive attacks on the First
[10:10.520 --> 10:15.040]  Amendment and when I get up here on the show and I say this is what I saw today
[10:15.040 --> 10:20.160]  without even looking the point is when I have four articles about massive attacks
[10:20.160 --> 10:25.720]  against free speech in the United States I'm not even looking for attacks on
[10:25.720 --> 10:35.320]  free speech and they're just everywhere every day it's amazing tea parties are
[10:35.320 --> 10:39.680]  being denied permits to demonstrate because they're quote hate groups in the
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.040]  United States well you don't need a permit to demonstrate but you go ahead
[10:44.040 --> 10:47.200]  and submit to that then they start denying the permit kind of like oh
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.240]  New York 50 something years ago oh you got to have a permit to own a gun then
[10:51.240 --> 10:56.080]  they just stop issuing the permits a permit or a license is an authorization
[10:56.080 --> 11:01.160]  to do something that would be illegal that's just one of the pieces that I
[11:01.160 --> 11:06.440]  have here four articles today with bonafide hardcore attacks on free
[11:06.440 --> 11:12.920]  speech against liberals conservatives you name it it's the full spectrum this
[11:12.920 --> 11:19.560]  whole homeland security system is for we the people not the CIA funded boogeymen
[11:19.560 --> 11:28.040]  in caves in Central Asia 10,000 miles away so that is coming up as well but
[11:28.040 --> 11:33.480]  let me go ahead now and get into some of the news dealing with the economy
[11:33.480 --> 11:42.560]  foreclosures rise repossessions set record at CNBC US foreclosure activity
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.080]  rose in August from the previous month and banks and lenders took ownership
[11:46.080 --> 11:50.920]  from homeowners at a record pace according to a new report released today
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.120]  bank repossessions often the final step in the foreclosure process after a
[11:55.120 --> 12:01.560]  home fails to sell at auction increased about 3% from the month before to 900 to
[12:01.560 --> 12:10.600]  95,364 again 95,364 a record high at the same time the number of properties
[12:10.600 --> 12:14.440]  that receive default notices the first step in the foreclosure process decreased
[12:14.440 --> 12:20.200]  by 1% from a month ago and fell 30% from a year ago so that's a good sign kind of
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.360]  a silver lining a sign that lenders are focusing on their backlog of foreclosure
[12:24.360 --> 12:28.480]  inventory before tackling new distressed loans according to foreclosure
[12:28.480 --> 12:32.720]  listing website reality track which released the report so you'd think that
[12:32.720 --> 12:36.160]  was a silver lining but in a way it isn't they're just grabbing so many homes
[12:36.160 --> 12:42.120]  they can't even digest all of them and the courts can't even process all of it
[12:42.120 --> 12:47.120]  and that's why I really support the lawyers and private citizens that have
[12:47.120 --> 12:53.320]  researched home loan laws it's illegal that these big lenders will take a loan
[12:53.320 --> 12:56.640]  and sell it over and over again and never transfer the deed properly never
[12:56.640 --> 13:02.200]  file it it's illegal that they routinely take the escrow and then continue to
[13:02.200 --> 13:05.280]  charge you for it even though you've already paid for it that even happened
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.240]  to yours truly 10 years ago with the first home I bought and I had to
[13:09.240 --> 13:13.280]  threaten to sue them to make the company stop and it wasn't even the bank that I
[13:13.280 --> 13:16.800]  had originally gotten my loan from my mortgage it had been sold I think four
[13:16.800 --> 13:21.160]  times at that time it was then sold some more so you're always having a new
[13:21.160 --> 13:27.160]  place to send your send your check send your mortgage payment and they do a lot
[13:27.160 --> 13:31.800]  of other things that are technically illegal and that violate your rights and
[13:31.800 --> 13:35.880]  the good news is tens of thousands of Americans conservatively are now fighting
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.400]  these out-of-control foreclosures in court and so that is slowing down the
[13:41.400 --> 13:45.240]  system being able to grab all of these homes now now I'm all for paying back
[13:45.240 --> 13:50.760]  debts that are truly owed but these central banks sold these loans to people
[13:50.760 --> 13:54.520]  they knew couldn't pay them that was part of their plan that's come out in the
[13:54.520 --> 13:59.640]  McClatchy newspaper reports where they got the Goldman Sachs internal memos and
[13:59.640 --> 14:05.360]  other major banks memos how they planned this and these companies are
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.600]  creating these loans out of fiat derivative packages that they're
[14:10.600 --> 14:15.800]  selling and so it's all based in fraud and they're not coming in trying to make
[14:15.800 --> 14:19.200]  deals with most people to lower their payment or to be fair or to help them
[14:19.200 --> 14:24.080]  they just want to repossess them and that's causing a chain reaction in the
[14:24.080 --> 14:28.400]  economy that further destroys the economy so I'm glad people are standing up
[14:28.400 --> 14:37.320]  for their rights on that important front continuing shocking CNBC headline home
[14:37.320 --> 14:44.000]  price double-dip begins this is from Tyler Durgan at zero hedge and it goes
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.360]  on to say Diana Olick by far the best reporter at CNBC and not merely an
[14:49.360 --> 14:54.880]  anchor regulator of propaganda bullet points let one slip today by posting an
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.760]  article on CNBC titled home price double-dip begins and we have a screen
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.960]  shot in case CNBC realizes the grave error it has made and retracts it while
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.000]  nothing new at zero hedge readers where we have been making the case for the
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.120]  economy has nothing to double dip to it's already plunged considering it has
[15:15.120 --> 15:22.280]  been in one depression for 33 months now it may catch the broader public by
[15:22.280 --> 15:27.080]  surprise miss Olick's arguments given the combination of the expiration of the
[15:27.080 --> 15:30.680]  home buyer tax credit and the increasing number of loans moving into final
[15:30.680 --> 15:34.520]  foreclosure we knew that home prices overall would take a hit but it would
[15:34.520 --> 15:38.880]  take a while well we're here now and there you have it there is little that
[15:38.880 --> 15:43.520]  can be done to add when dealing with the simple truth of course for CNBC to
[15:43.520 --> 15:49.520]  regain its floundering Nielsen ratings it would take all the daily staff to
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.160]  follow in mrs. Olick's example to report what is actually happening in the
[15:53.160 --> 15:59.280]  country instead of what Joe love Wagner believes should be happening based on the
[15:59.280 --> 16:07.400]  gold-seeked output his economic model is spewing forth alas it now is far too
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.840]  late for the cable station to regain the much needed credibility especially when
[16:12.840 --> 16:17.440]  anchors tell guests who dare to question the propaganda assumptions that they
[16:17.440 --> 16:23.320]  disagree with that they are not welcome we're in a depression ladies and
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.760]  gentlemen and the solutions the central banks are bringing us are only going to
[16:27.760 --> 16:31.920]  make things worse Alan Greenspan's out in the news today saying look we got to
[16:31.920 --> 16:38.400]  raise taxes to fix the economy every other economist worth their salt knows
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.720]  you raise taxes in a deep recession or depression it will further stall the
[16:42.720 --> 16:47.720]  engine if you've got an engine already stalling from not having enough fuel
[16:47.720 --> 16:52.480]  going into the fuel injectors and you take your foot off the gas what's going
[16:52.480 --> 16:57.800]  to happen the call the engine is going to stall and the bailout money never
[16:57.800 --> 17:01.640]  gets to the people he goes right to the central banks to go out and purchase more
[17:01.640 --> 17:06.240]  assets to buy off more companies to consolidate their power and so their
[17:06.240 --> 17:11.800]  answer is raise the taxes which will actually reduce receipts coming into
[17:11.800 --> 17:15.240]  the government overall because it'll stall the economy and just give that
[17:15.240 --> 17:19.720]  money to the banks so that when the economy continues to shut down nobody
[17:19.720 --> 17:22.800]  has money but them so they can come in and give you offers that you can't
[17:22.800 --> 17:30.000]  refuse continuing globalist sorrows declares gold is the ultimate bubble
[17:30.000 --> 17:36.400]  again meanwhile French news agency reports as we speak gold hits another
[17:36.400 --> 17:43.240]  record high at $1,278 an ounce so it's reaching all new highs all this week
[17:43.240 --> 17:47.200]  there was a lot of profit taking yesterday and gold dropped a bit but then
[17:47.200 --> 17:51.480]  surged right back up above its previous record here's a Bloomberg headline gold
[17:51.480 --> 17:56.440]  rises to record on increased demand for wealth protection gold rose a record
[17:56.440 --> 17:59.560]  New York and London as investors sought protection against turmoil in the

[18:09.640 --> 18:12.960]  fell to a five-week low against the euro today the metal usually moves

[18:17.960 --> 18:22.040]  products rose 16% this year and this month reached a record Bloomberg data
[18:22.040 --> 18:29.480]  shows and what did the Bloomberg report on two weeks ago that the majority the
[18:29.480 --> 18:42.280]  largest group of gold future investments are basically set at $1,500 an
[18:42.280 --> 18:52.800]  ounce so the futures trading going on in gold the the largest group of those is
[18:52.800 --> 18:58.200]  betting that's kind of like saying Vegas is putting out these odds well the the
[18:58.200 --> 19:05.680]  the mercantile system in Chicago the stock exchange in New York the most
[19:05.680 --> 19:15.400]  popular bet by the big boys is $1,500 an ounce gold by December in fact will you
[19:15.400 --> 19:22.280]  guys pull up that headline it's $1,500 gold by December Bloomberg and then it
[19:22.280 --> 19:26.480]  goes into those numbers so people watching at prison planet dot TV can
[19:26.480 --> 19:32.200]  actually actually see that for themselves we come back more Democrats

[19:40.240 --> 19:45.320]  must rise to fight budget deficit Greenspan says and then there's that

[24:59.560 --> 25:05.720]  Lord Christopher Monkton coming up let me go ahead and start getting into free
[25:05.720 --> 25:10.480]  speech issues before I get more into the economy and the latest eugenics
[25:10.480 --> 25:19.120]  developments here is a headline today from Paul Joseph Watson and it links to
[25:19.120 --> 25:24.240]  ABC Good Morning America where these comments were made justice Breyer
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.840]  suggests globalization Trump's First Amendment and he went on to say you've
[25:29.840 --> 25:35.120]  got free speech but if you try to burn a Quran that's or destroy a Quran for that
[25:35.120 --> 25:39.400]  matter or a Bible you can go read the quotes and watch the video we've got it
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.960]  link there on the site that if you do that that's like yelling fire in a
[25:43.960 --> 25:47.760]  theater no going in a theater and yelling fire and people nowadays go why is
[25:47.760 --> 25:51.760]  fire in a theater a danger when you ever hear of that well in the old days the
[25:51.760 --> 25:57.800]  cellulose that they used on the reels was extremely flammable and that's why
[25:57.800 --> 26:03.720]  if you're ever in an old theater and it can get a tour of a 60 70 80 90 year old
[26:03.720 --> 26:10.020]  theater the projector rooms are armored with concrete big metal doors because
[26:10.020 --> 26:13.720]  they would explode and then all the other film would explode and theaters
[26:13.720 --> 26:17.480]  would burn down and they had just hundreds of cases in Italy the United
[26:17.480 --> 26:23.160]  States Europe of these things catching on fire and killing people and because
[26:23.160 --> 26:27.120]  the projectors back towards the exits sometimes blocking the exits so that's
[26:27.120 --> 26:31.440]  where the older Supreme Court rulings came from that you've got free speech
[26:31.440 --> 26:37.800]  but you can't yell fire in a theater that'd be like if you ran into a sports
[26:37.800 --> 26:42.440]  stadium and got on the bullhorn and said there's a bomb there's a bomb and
[26:42.440 --> 26:48.840]  people start trampling each other that is not free speech that is lying in a
[26:48.840 --> 26:54.280]  public place to create panic so to have the Supreme Court justice saying yeah
[26:54.280 --> 26:59.440]  we might rule that you can't you know burn an American flag burn a Quran burn a
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.200]  Bible anything that makes a group angry this is how Europe has passed anti free
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.720]  speech laws saying well if you hurt somebody's feelings that could create
[27:07.720 --> 27:15.000]  division no it's the fault of Christians who don't want free speech and say that
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.160]  you can't burn a Bible I don't like burning a Bible but that's free speech I
[27:19.160 --> 27:23.040]  have free speech to say it's it's disrespectful Shaq religious and
[27:23.040 --> 27:28.000]  insulting and stupid if Christians get mad about that it's their fault though
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.360]  we're not really seeing that if Muslims get angry and riot because somebody
[27:32.360 --> 27:37.360]  publishes a cartoon of Muhammad with his turban as a bomb that's their problem
[27:37.360 --> 27:41.240]  being intolerant against free speech in this country or free speech in Europe
[27:41.240 --> 27:46.280]  they've now phased out in the name of that that's the issue it's people doing
[27:46.280 --> 27:51.200]  violent things or threatening people over someone else's speech that is not
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.520]  acceptable that's a violation of the First Amendment it's just like if
[27:55.520 --> 28:00.680]  somebody gets up on the radio and says kill Muslims or kill Jews or kill blacks
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.760]  or kill whites that goes over the line remember those black panthers saying
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.920]  kill whites kill their babies that's not free speech if you go out in public and
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.120]  say we need to kill white people we need to kill black people that is a call to
[28:15.120 --> 28:22.040]  action for violence okay that is racketeering that is intimidation that
[28:22.040 --> 28:30.040]  is a call for a criminal act that is criminal organizing and inside these
[28:30.040 --> 28:33.520]  politically correct systems though they're always going to let the Muslims
[28:33.520 --> 28:37.680]  or black groups or others call for violence because they're busy playing
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.600]  groups off against each other that's why the feds allowed Hal Turner for a
[28:41.600 --> 28:45.880]  decade to call for violence because he was an FBI operative trying to stir up
[28:45.880 --> 28:49.240]  violence to then demonize any type of conservative groups and that's now
[28:49.240 --> 28:54.880]  confirmed so very dangerous to have Justice Breyer saying that well we're
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.880]  in a globalized world that's the quote and that it trumps the First Amendment
[28:58.880 --> 29:08.320]  no slicing up or burning a Bible or a Koran as long as it's done on your own
[29:08.320 --> 29:13.160]  property or or not done during a burn ban you know where it could burn down
[29:13.160 --> 29:18.520]  the you know forest or whatever then you have that First Amendment and it's not
[29:18.520 --> 29:22.960]  trumped by the fact that some people who are intolerant may go crazy over it so
[29:22.960 --> 29:29.960]  that's one of the articles that was on ABC Good Morning America yesterday when
[29:29.960 --> 29:34.960]  we come back Bill O'Reilly says don't let 9-11 truthers within 10 miles of

[33:29.760 --> 33:36.120]  continue with the attacks on free speech in this nation we have Justice
[33:36.120 --> 33:41.520]  Breyer saying that well burning a Quran we may rule that that's fire in a theater
[33:41.520 --> 33:46.840]  and that you don't have that right and then next it's anything else that might
[33:46.840 --> 33:52.680]  upset somebody and we've got all these czars in the White House calling for
[33:52.680 --> 33:58.960]  censorship we've got Cass Sunstein calling for it it's just everywhere now
[33:58.960 --> 34:02.480]  here's another one and again we have the video linked in this article if you want
[34:02.480 --> 34:09.720]  to go watch it O'Reilly says 9-11 truth activists are dangerous radicals and then
[34:09.720 --> 34:14.640]  he names several people Cindy Sheehan has now gone public completely for 9-11
[34:14.640 --> 34:17.320]  truth she's always said she questions the official story now she's saying
[34:17.320 --> 34:21.600]  clearly it's an inside job and Bill O'Reilly is added again this is a Kurt
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.720]  Nemo story remember when he called for squashing the First Amendment rights of
[34:25.720 --> 34:29.800]  Americans opposed to the illegal invasion of Iraq he said and it's our duty as
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.960]  loyal Americans to shut up and it is our duty to loyal Americans to shut up
[34:34.960 --> 34:42.400]  once the fighting begins he said that back March 3rd 2003 right around the
[34:42.400 --> 34:49.200]  same time that all those different Hollywood people and people like
[34:49.200 --> 34:52.960]  Britney Spears were saying I just think we should shut up and do whatever our
[34:52.960 --> 34:56.760]  president says never question that's what it is to be patriotic you do what
[34:56.760 --> 35:00.480]  your government says of course that's the opposite of what the founders said the
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.320]  opposite of what common sense is facts soon revealed the neocons had
[35:06.320 --> 35:09.840]  bamboozled the nation into invading Iraq under false pretenses but we didn't
[35:09.840 --> 35:14.240]  get a retraction from Bill now O'Reilly is criticizing 9-11 truth activists as
[35:14.240 --> 35:23.280]  dangerous radicals and he went on to demonize the 9-11 mosque the ground zero
[35:23.280 --> 35:29.080]  mosque that's two blocks away that's being financed by the one of the main
[35:29.080 --> 35:33.840]  owners the second largest owner of news corps that is CIA funded that's New
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.600]  York Observer that is funded by the Carnegie Rockefeller and Ford
[35:38.600 --> 35:42.360]  Foundation you can go to the mosque Foundation website and read right there
[35:42.360 --> 35:47.440]  who's funding it they've made it all public and so it's the establishment
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.320]  funding this and then they come out and say 9-11 truth they're the ones they're
[35:52.320 --> 35:56.760]  involved I mean there's no connection to reality just a bunch of Fox News viewers
[35:56.760 --> 36:01.080]  are now going to hear this and think those dirty 9-11 truthers they're now
[36:01.080 --> 36:06.520]  down there you know supporting the mosque when 9-11 truth was down there
[36:06.520 --> 36:11.200]  protesting with the victims families and others saying look forget the mosque
[36:11.200 --> 36:16.960]  the police the firefighters and others need medical care the media keeps saying
[36:16.960 --> 36:22.880]  900 have died it was 1500 and con in a congressional report what two years ago
[36:22.880 --> 36:27.480]  it's well over 2,000 of the first responders have died and major medical
[36:27.480 --> 36:31.880]  institutions have done the scans of their lungs they're just full of asbestos
[36:31.880 --> 36:36.160]  and everything else and they're dying dead and dying so that's a lower number
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.880]  out there that they've been using that's gotta be four or five years old and he
[36:41.880 --> 36:50.720]  goes on to claim that the Muslim scholar involved with the mosque is also a
[36:50.720 --> 36:56.760]  9-11 truth there and he goes on to say that 9-11 truthers should be kept far
[36:56.760 --> 37:02.040]  away from ground zero they should quote not be allowed within 10 miles of ground
[37:02.040 --> 37:07.560]  zero so let's get this straight the Supreme Court justice is saying they may
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.760]  ban burning carans you're not gonna have that right they're claiming under the
[37:12.760 --> 37:17.400]  First Amendment they're telling ABC News good morning America that O'Reilly
[37:17.400 --> 37:27.280]  saying don't let 9-11 truthers quote within 10 miles of ground zero and then
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.200]  we've got this report which is even more out of control more brazen more insane
[37:33.200 --> 37:37.800]  this is a prisonplanet.com article by Steve Watson and I remember seeing this
[37:37.800 --> 37:44.440]  a couple months ago in this particular state in the mainstream news and he has
[37:44.440 --> 37:48.640]  links to it in his article I mean again I have trouble even believing this is
[37:48.640 --> 37:55.720]  happening where tea parties groups have been denied permits but but but now
[37:55.720 --> 37:59.720]  there's lawsuits filed it's going to court and they're telling them you're
[37:59.720 --> 38:05.480]  not allowed to go protest or even have a constitution rally on Constitution Day
[38:05.480 --> 38:11.520]  because of your political affiliations because tea parties are hate groups now
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.240]  remember what was going on under Clinton and under Bush and now Obama every FBI
[38:17.240 --> 38:22.800]  report and training manual and and and state police training manuals and
[38:22.800 --> 38:28.280]  federal marshals slat training the list goes on and on says the main threat is
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.320]  gun owners conservatives returning veterans gun owning veterans libertarians
[38:32.320 --> 38:35.800]  Ron Paul supporters people that want to get out of the Federal Reserve people
[38:35.800 --> 38:41.080]  that want to get out of the UN and it just came out yesterday that multiple
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.880]  states have got intelligence reports on mainline tea party groups and are
[38:47.880 --> 38:54.080]  listing them as terrorists because they say by protesting taxes that will cut
[38:54.080 --> 38:57.800]  off money to the government so they're a threat to the infrastructure see now if
[38:57.800 --> 39:00.880]  you don't want higher taxes the government says it's its own entity
[39:00.880 --> 39:05.960]  separate from the people and that that is trying to cut off their blood supply
[39:05.960 --> 39:10.240]  and so you're an enemy of the state in fact will you print that article again
[39:10.240 --> 39:15.480]  that I think it was Kurt did it yesterday where the governor of that one
[39:15.480 --> 39:21.160]  state is apologizing for saying that anti tax groups are terrorist he was
[39:21.160 --> 39:24.960]  apologizing and saying it was wrong that the state had issued a report to be
[39:24.960 --> 39:30.320]  technical but but but here's the new report government bans tea party from
[39:30.320 --> 39:34.560]  celebrating US Constitution local government representatives in an Ohio
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.920]  town have taken it upon themselves to prohibit a tea party celebration of the
[39:39.920 --> 39:44.800]  US Constitution which of course protects and guards those rights prompting a
[39:44.800 --> 39:48.200]  lawsuit over restrictions on the First Amendment rights and this is happening in
[39:48.200 --> 39:53.480]  multiple Ohio towns this is just one one case they're suing over members of the
[39:53.480 --> 39:58.160]  and over tea party in Ohio have been informed that they cannot hold a public
[39:58.160 --> 40:03.160]  rally in the town square central square on Constitution Day September 17th
[40:03.160 --> 40:08.240]  because of the group's political affiliation and remember in all these
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.800]  states the tea parties listed as terrorist and that the government wants
[40:12.800 --> 40:16.840]  to keep that secret though they're very upset that the public's finding out the
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.240]  decision was taken by the township's trustees and members of the tea party
[40:20.240 --> 40:24.160]  group were informed by letter that they would not be able to use the square for
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.680]  speakers and performances of patriotic songs and we've seen case after case in
[40:29.680 --> 40:34.160]  Ohio where other towns and cities are saying you can't march you can't
[40:34.160 --> 40:40.760]  demonstrate now again the Macy's Day Parade the St. Patrick's Day parades
[40:40.760 --> 40:45.880]  things like this where you take over you know many many blocks for several hours
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.840]  for a parade you've got to get a permit for that because the police have to come
[40:50.840 --> 40:56.800]  out and they have to block off the streets but town squares were built for
[40:56.800 --> 41:01.280]  political functions town squares were paid for by the people and if it's on a
[41:01.280 --> 41:05.640]  street corner or a town square or on your own private property we're now
[41:05.640 --> 41:09.880]  seeing cases where they claim you've got to get a permit and then they deny that
[41:09.880 --> 41:13.840]  permit but the courts have ruled over and over again you don't have to get a
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.400]  permit to go out and demonstrate back in 2000 the state police lost a whole
[41:19.400 --> 41:23.040]  bunch of lawsuits the first suit they lost the Dallas Morning News reported
[41:23.040 --> 41:29.680]  was a disabled rights group that would just go and protest across the street
[41:29.680 --> 41:34.640]  from the governor's mansion and they came and arrested a whole bunch of people
[41:34.640 --> 41:38.560]  in wheelchairs and I remember going and trying to demonstrate down there for
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.240]  other issues for the Second Amendment and things like that going back 15 years
[41:42.240 --> 41:45.000]  ago the state police would come over and say you're gonna be arrested if you
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.400]  don't leave you got to have a permit and I explained you can't issue a permit
[41:48.400 --> 41:54.280]  for me to be out here with you know 30 40 people with a bullhorn and I would
[41:54.280 --> 41:57.400]  tell them you know I'm gonna have to sue you I don't want to sue you personally
[41:57.400 --> 42:01.280]  officer just don't violate my First Amendment and they would back off but
[42:01.280 --> 42:04.920]  they didn't do that with a lot of people so they lost those famous lawsuits and
[42:04.920 --> 42:12.520]  it's the same issue but imagine the brazenness I mean this is naked corruption
[42:12.520 --> 42:17.960]  to tell these people over and over again you can't this isn't the first time in
[42:17.960 --> 42:23.520]  Ohio you can't have a demonstration because we don't like your political views
[42:23.520 --> 42:30.240]  and we're not going to put up with that township officials inform the
[42:30.240 --> 42:33.360]  residents that the speech at the Constitution Day rally would be a
[42:33.360 --> 42:40.200]  political nature and that's inappropriate for the public square see go
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.560]  back 60 years ago from the founding of this nation and the Bill of Rights
[42:45.560 --> 42:49.560]  First Amendment Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
[42:49.560 --> 42:53.920]  religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the press or the
[42:53.920 --> 42:58.680]  right to peaceably assemble for redress of grievances it's the press it's the
[42:58.680 --> 43:06.240]  rallies it's religion Congress shall make no law and states can make no law as
[43:06.240 --> 43:11.920]  well because they're mirrors of that federal Constitution but what do they
[43:11.920 --> 43:17.400]  say they told the churches in the last 60 years or so the big mega the big
[43:17.400 --> 43:21.600]  mega denominations started the ball rolling paid off by the Rockefeller
[43:21.600 --> 43:25.040]  Foundation and others with the World Council of Churches they went into the
[43:25.040 --> 43:28.120]  big denomination leaders and said look we'll let you keep having your tax exempt
[43:28.120 --> 43:32.720]  status but now we've passed a law but Congress shall make no law before there
[43:32.720 --> 43:36.360]  was no law because they could make no law churches were not taxable because
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.720]  Congress could make no law they had no jurisdiction the federal government has
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.440]  no jurisdiction over religion because if they can do that they can end the
[43:44.440 --> 43:47.840]  separation of church and state and that means they can create a government
[43:47.840 --> 43:51.880]  sponsored religion whether it's humanism environmentalism communism
[43:51.880 --> 44:00.160]  Islam Christianity Catholicism Judaism whatever the case is see they all the
[44:00.160 --> 44:04.400]  controlled left always uses Thomas Jefferson's letter about separation of
[44:04.400 --> 44:09.760]  church and state as he was quantifying what the First Amendment meant to say
[44:09.760 --> 44:12.640]  oh see you can't have people being religious in America or you can't have
[44:12.640 --> 44:15.800]  somebody praying at lunch in a public school or you can't have somebody carry
[44:15.800 --> 44:21.040]  their Bible to school or you know we're allowed to come in and regulate your
[44:21.040 --> 44:24.760]  church that's the opposite of what separation of church and state is
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.400]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or
[44:30.400 --> 44:37.040]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof shall make no law just like Second
[44:37.040 --> 44:41.720]  Amendment the right to keep and bear arms the right of the people the people
[44:41.720 --> 44:47.040]  the people that's us not the army the people to keep and bear arms shall not
[44:47.040 --> 44:53.560]  shall not be infringed doesn't get any more clear than that same thing here
[44:53.560 --> 44:58.360]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or
[44:58.360 --> 45:03.000]  prohibiting the free exercise thereof but the last 60 years starting the 1950s
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.160]  the big mega churches came in they told all their little churches around the
[45:06.160 --> 45:09.720]  country that were part of their denominations and part of their seminary
[45:09.720 --> 45:17.840]  you will now sign up for 501c3 which made you a charity a charitable
[45:17.840 --> 45:23.600]  organization the government created a new class and then tricked almost all the
[45:23.600 --> 45:27.960]  churches to get involved until now if your church isn't 501c3 and you say
[45:27.960 --> 45:33.000]  look I'm not part of that they come after your church with taxes and
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.000]  regulations and they've even swatting them you know in famous cases taking
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.120]  them over the famous case with the big Baptist temple with thousands of
[45:42.120 --> 45:51.360]  members so this is how they phase this in they come in and they tell the
[45:51.360 --> 45:55.760]  churches oh just sign this form and then now I've been given from local Baptist
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.680]  churches you name it the letters they even give not just their pastors and
[46:00.680 --> 46:04.120]  deacons and Sunday school teachers but they give the entire congregation
[46:04.120 --> 46:09.120]  letters saying you will not talk about politics when we have church lunches or
[46:09.120 --> 46:14.640]  church brunches you will not talk about politics in the pews or before church or
[46:14.640 --> 46:19.720]  in the parking lot I have been given this by people that live in Austin we've
[46:19.720 --> 46:24.160]  covered it here on air and this is going on nationwide and they come in and they
[46:24.160 --> 46:27.920]  tell them you don't even talk about politics well a preacher has a right
[46:27.920 --> 46:31.480]  under the First Amendment to say we're against abortion we're against this
[46:31.480 --> 46:34.960]  candidate because they're for abortion that's their first amendment as a
[46:34.960 --> 46:39.960]  private citizen and as a pastor and it's your right in the pews of the church to
[46:39.960 --> 46:45.560]  have your free speech that's how far this tyranny has gone and then violating
[46:45.560 --> 46:50.240]  that separation of church and state now we have the clergy response teams being
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.240]  trained to tell their flocks to submit to government Romans 13 turn your guns
[46:54.240 --> 47:01.760]  in if you're told so they've slowly over time phase this in and now not only
[47:01.760 --> 47:05.560]  can people not have their own political views in the church or their views on
[47:05.560 --> 47:09.600]  any issue I've seen articles where preachers speak out against local
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.880]  environmental land grabs and they get threats by the IRS this is just like in
[47:14.880 --> 47:18.560]  China where you can have a church it's just got to be government approved we
[47:18.560 --> 47:24.800]  now have government approved religion in this country go back to in the last 60
[47:24.800 --> 47:29.400]  plus years in New York City everybody can own guns the government comes in and
[47:29.400 --> 47:33.280]  says we're just gonna have a permit five dollars everybody can get one then they
[47:33.280 --> 47:38.280]  stop issuing the permits they turn a right into a privilege and now it's the
[47:38.280 --> 47:41.560]  same thing with demonstrating I've seen articles like this in California and
[47:41.560 --> 47:47.640]  Texas and not just Ohio we're not just picking on Ohio here I've seen stories
[47:47.640 --> 47:55.080]  similar to this in places like Kentucky where the police tell people you're not
[47:55.080 --> 47:58.400]  allowed to hand out Alex Jones films they said in the court case with Kelly
[47:58.400 --> 48:02.640]  rushing this film criticizes the government and isn't respectful to
[48:02.640 --> 48:11.240]  police so we're gonna arrest you I mean think about how far we've gone compare
[48:11.240 --> 48:16.280]  us to Soviet Russia compare us to China now we haven't gotten to the point where
[48:16.280 --> 48:19.960]  they're able to shut everybody down and intimidate everybody and we've got such a
[48:19.960 --> 48:24.200]  history of liberty and freedom and free speech that folks aren't following all
[48:24.200 --> 48:28.640]  these attempted covert rules and regulations but they're now really
[48:28.640 --> 48:35.160]  coming in pushing for this so in the United States of America all over the
[48:35.160 --> 48:40.920]  country coast to coast they lie and violate people's rights and say if you
[48:40.920 --> 48:45.400]  want to have a demonstration at the town square or in front of the Capitol or on
[48:45.400 --> 48:48.720]  a street corner you've got to get a permit that's line number one that's
[48:48.720 --> 48:55.160]  prior restraint of a political event political speech but they blur the lines
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.360]  you do need the permit if you're gonna block streets that's different if you
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.600]  want to commercial Macy's parade that's different if you want to shut down
[49:04.600 --> 49:09.520]  everybody's commerce and get in the way of their rights to mobility but they'll
[49:09.520 --> 49:12.240]  let any other group go to this town square and have their own political
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.640]  events but because the Tea Party because they don't like their political
[49:16.640 --> 49:22.840]  speech and we've seen reports in Ohio in Pennsylvania specifically demonizing
[49:22.840 --> 49:27.240]  the Tea Party internal police intelligence reports written by the
[49:27.240 --> 49:30.520]  federal government who themselves got the material from the 80 owns other
[49:30.520 --> 49:34.240]  property law center they're saying well we're gonna selectively discriminate
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.400]  against you and say because you have a political nature to you and you want to
[49:39.400 --> 49:44.680]  sing patriotic songs and you want to celebrate the Constitution and what
[49:44.680 --> 49:51.960]  America is is based on the heart of this country we are denying your permit
[49:53.760 --> 50:00.120]  think about that and now the FCC says oh yes as part of cybersecurity we are
[50:00.120 --> 50:05.760]  going to not just regulate terrestrial radio and TV and cable we're going to
[50:05.760 --> 50:10.240]  start regulating the internet and what you can say and we're gonna have
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.280]  regional boards of government-appointed citizens who speak for the citizens really
[50:15.280 --> 50:19.920]  speak for the globalist who will then file complaints on private citizens who
[50:19.920 --> 50:25.920]  have news blogs or radio shows like a bar grievance against a lawyer and then
[50:25.920 --> 50:32.800]  that board will then go to the FCC and recommend cash sanctions against you and
[50:32.800 --> 50:36.840]  what is the FCC saying their diversities are says if you criticize
[50:36.840 --> 50:40.960]  Obama if you say something they think isn't true about Obama you're gonna be
[50:40.960 --> 50:45.000]  fined or you'll be arrested what does Cass Sunstein say the same thing I mean
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.200]  we have to realize how dictatorial and oppressive and criminal these people are
[50:50.200 --> 50:55.400]  there in our country telling us we can't rally telling us what our churches can
[50:55.400 --> 51:02.080]  say tell it's incredible we'll be right back stay with us hi this is Alex Jones

[51:05.960 --> 51:09.360]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[51:09.360 --> 51:13.200]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[51:13.200 --> 51:16.880]  seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[51:16.880 --> 51:20.600]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have

[54:10.200 --> 54:16.080]  here's a few more of some of the recent news articles here's one from
[54:16.080 --> 54:20.560]  yesterday where they're demonizing anybody that criticizes the out of
[54:20.560 --> 54:25.400]  control taxation in this country and the government is saying the federal
[54:25.400 --> 54:28.440]  government wrote this report it was issued to Pennsylvania law enforcement
[54:28.440 --> 54:32.920]  that if you are against higher taxes that's basically terrorism because it
[54:32.920 --> 54:36.880]  could cut the government's money off and remember what that clergy response team
[54:36.880 --> 54:43.400]  newscasts out of New Orleans stated a few years ago weighing the government's
[54:43.400 --> 54:46.760]  needs against those of the people and dealing with the government's biggest
[54:46.760 --> 54:53.480]  enemy biggest threat the people see this is openly taught to law enforcement
[54:53.480 --> 54:56.880]  openly taught to bureaucrats so now they're just out in the open going yes
[54:56.880 --> 55:00.920]  you're the enemy you are the American people if you try to demonstrate you
[55:00.920 --> 55:07.960]  try to protest we're like Romania which shall Chescu that's evil and you need to
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.600]  be watched in fact I have another report where people that are protesting are
[55:13.600 --> 55:17.640]  being put on list and they want you to know this now they want you to be scared
[55:17.640 --> 55:22.520]  and shut up they're open bullies doing this and they're trying to sell the
[55:22.520 --> 55:27.880]  idea to police and the military that they're training with police that this
[55:27.880 --> 55:31.120]  is all normal but the military and police are really starting to wake up
[55:31.120 --> 55:35.280]  they're going wait a minute but here's the headline Pennsylvania Homeland
[55:35.280 --> 55:42.600]  Security puts anti-tax protesters on list of terror threats and it goes over
[55:42.600 --> 55:45.600]  all of that here's another one DOJ demonizes constitutionalist as
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.760]  extremist criminals these reports are just pouring out the government has
[55:50.760 --> 55:55.320]  accelerated these reports they're not they're not backing off they're
[55:55.320 --> 56:01.000]  intensifying what they're doing we're not gonna let you burn the Quran the
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.040]  Supreme Court Justice says we're not gonna let you protest within 10 miles
[56:05.040 --> 56:08.760]  of ground zero for 9-11 truth we're not gonna let you have a tea party
[56:08.760 --> 56:12.760]  demonstration for the Constitution we're gonna put you on list if you want to
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.480]  cut taxes you don't have a right as a citizen to have free speech you're not
[56:16.480 --> 56:20.760]  part of this government the government sees you as the number one enemy because
[56:20.760 --> 56:27.440]  it's not a real government it's a bunch of crooks here's another headline
[56:27.440 --> 56:34.560]  shooter terrorizes campus during mock drill this just came out of WPSD local

[57:43.160 --> 57:48.480]  it's how we wake people up by the Obama deception for 1995 the pivotal film to
[57:48.480 --> 57:51.520]  wake up conservatives and liberals and shadow the left-right paradigm and

[58:50.480 --> 58:53.840]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:53.840 --> 58:57.800]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:57.800 --> 59:02.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.040 --> 59:06.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.320 --> 59:10.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:10.680 --> 59:14.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:14.760 --> 59:19.280]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.280 --> 59:23.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.440 --> 59:27.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.400 --> 59:31.240]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.240 --> 59:33.960]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:33.960 --> 59:39.960]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:39.960 --> 59:44.480]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go

[59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.560]  Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:32.920]  Alex Jones my friends the president of the Czech Republic has said it Ron Paul
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.920]  has said it Lord Christopher Moncton has broken it down on record if you study
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.720]  the club of Rome the UN Al Gore all of these groups they openly admit they
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.720]  want a global authoritarian environmentally backed and based tyranny
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.160]  and now because the world is waking up to their fraud they are all over the news
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:59.880]  every day saying we don't care what you want we don't care what you stand for we
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:05.000]  don't care what you do we don't care how much fraud we get caught in we now want
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.720]  an authoritarian system to enforce carbon rationing literally taxing you for
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.320]  breathing you exhale carbon and we are going to force this on you one way or
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.800]  another and they're openly coming out and saying they want to restrict our
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:30.800]  criticism of them this is bonafide out in the open oppression bonafide
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.400]  tyranny and Paul Watson has got a report that is set to be published very very
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:45.520]  soon at prisonplanet.com today that I worked on with him this morning and as
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:54.520]  soon as it goes up in the third hour I'm gonna read over it but what they're
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:59.200]  doing is really pretty simple they're creating artificial scarcity you know
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.520]  diamonds are semi-precious but because they're geographically isolated a
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:10.560]  cartel has been formed known as the beers where they're able to keep the
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:16.040]  price incredibly high well if they start taxing and regulating and government
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.120]  has the power to decide who's allowed to have a factory who's allowed to have a
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:25.280]  business and they put huge cost on carbon that is more than artificial
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:32.440]  scarcity it puts a tax on the life cycle of this planet and it's over every
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:43.120]  facet of our lives it controls every area and it is designed in the words of
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.760]  Murray Strong at the UN and Ted Turner and Prince Philip and the head of NASA
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:56.040]  climate to quote end industrialized society but they mean end industrialized
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.680]  society for the general public you will have reservations of government slash
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:08.160]  mega corporate technological systems that will be under global national
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.440]  international security that will be kept from the general public so you
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.600]  literally have the elite splitting off curtailing technological development and
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.160]  industrial development for the rest of us while hoarding it to themselves and
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:28.520]  accelerating those technologies so that they can even expand their technological
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:35.880]  dominance over us so this is the information and I saw a London Guardian
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:42.240]  report last night where they came out and said a powerful consortium of elites
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.640]  now want weather modification to save the earth from global warming that itself
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.400]  is a cover for weather weapons and that's admitted and it's a cover for all
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.840]  the geoengineering that's already going on in fact I forgot to print that geo
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.760]  engineering report last night actually did print it and then it was gone off my
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:12.200]  desk this morning when I came in here it is now that's another report women
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:17.760]  are more likely to accept climate science than men I'll try to dig that out of my
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:26.440]  out of my stack come coming up but basically the headline dealt with
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.760]  powerful consortium you know moving for global climate control so so so these
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:38.720]  people want to play God and run every facet of our lives and they want to wall
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.960]  us off for technological development while they basically ascend with these
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.200]  systems and at the end of the day they want massive force population reduction
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.800]  so we won't even have a stake in the future we'll be right back ladies and
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.440]  gentlemen on the other side we should have Lord Moncton to break all these
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.160]  latest developments down with us stay with us
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.560]  listen up friends this is Alex Jones with key information the mainstream media

[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:20.640]  we're live ladies and gentlemen into the second hour now it is Thursday the
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.600]  16th day of September 2010 Lord Christopher Moncton the third by count of
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.200]  Moncton and wrenchley worked as press officer for the conservative central
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.160]  office I was also one of the chief advisors to Margaret Thatcher has
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.960]  written and been managing editor for the Sunday Telegraph magazine the list
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.800]  just goes on and on he's also an inventor and he has really been the chief
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.200]  main focal point if you had to say there was a general out there fighting the
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.760]  eugenicist fighting the control freaks that want to set up a carbon tyranny
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.960]  it's Lord Christopher Moncton and so much has happened in the last few months
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.320]  they've admitted climate gate was real now they've admitted the IPCC report was
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.880]  a complete fraud their own authors have come out and said that they've admitted
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.920]  that the earth is actually cooling that they I mean word for word everything
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.400]  Moncton is has has has documented at his website all the research papers he's
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.440]  written he's been vindicated completely in spades I mean he couldn't be more
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.200]  vindicated but meanwhile they're not backing off they're saying we're gonna
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.720]  change the nomenclature we're gonna launch massive geoengineering to save
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.720]  you from global warming they're saying that they do want to arrest people that
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:42.240]  are climate deniers they are running TV ads with children saying I'm putting you
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.040]  on notice you're my parents you know we're taking the gloves off Al Gore is
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.120]  giving more speeches to children saying tell your parents what to do the public
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.640]  schools everywhere in this country and I know in England are still brainwashing
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.000]  the children saying we're all dead it doesn't matter if islands all over the
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.360]  Pacific are actually getting bigger and many sea level ratings are going down
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:08.320]  they don't care they don't care they're going forward with all of this and now
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.320]  I have the headline Obama's science advisor says don't call it global warming
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:18.080]  call it our deteriorating climate our deteriorating atmosphere and we need to
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:24.160]  stabilize the the climate meaning if there's ever any type of cold temperatures
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:29.160]  hot temperatures that's abnormal the earth should be basically 76 degrees year
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.680]  round and they're also moving into saying that all the animals are becoming
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.880]  extinct so that'll be their new way to steal people's property so we've
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.960]  basically routed them intellectually but they're dug in and they're not
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.160]  stopping and I turn the radio on all I hear is by our car it's green by this
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.360]  house it's green Germany's passing laws that by 2020 all single dwelling homes
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.880]  will be illegal you've got to live in dormitories with others I mean they're
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.920]  not stopping and so Lord Christopher Monkton is our guest Lord Monkton good
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.280]  to have you on well Alex it's great to be with you once again and what a
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:11.160]  formidable list you've just given of the antics of the global warming extremists
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:17.680]  worldwide they are yet again trying to cause trouble by maintaining the all
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.560]  flogging this dead horse trying to maintain the scare which now everybody
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:26.480]  knows is no longer real there's been no significant global warming for the last
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.160]  decade now even the University of East Anglia where I'm going to visit in a
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.200]  couple of months time is admitting that they've now said yeah we actually have
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:41.000]  to have the warming we expected to see well no they haven't because CO2 is
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.360]  only a big part player in the climate I've just come back from a very
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.440]  interesting conference at Erija in Sicily of the World Federation of
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:57.120]  Scientists these are 250 of the world's top scientists looking into planetary
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.080]  emergencies they have an annual session once a year on a mountain top overlooking
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:07.800]  the ocean and there I was with these scientists and I gave them a
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:12.480]  presentation showing my own calculations which indicated that we don't have a
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.920]  problem with the climate yes we can generally expect it maybe to get a
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.840]  little warmer but not enough to worry about and what was interesting was that
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:25.040]  three other scientists there gave similar presentations coming from
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.360]  completely different directions and all concluding if we double the CO2 in the
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:35.840]  atmosphere maybe we'll see one Celsius degree or two Fahrenheit degrees of
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:41.240]  warming this century that is all is that to worry about no of course it isn't
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.640]  and you mentioned geoengineering well what is the point of doing geoengineering
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.720]  unless you know which direction to geoengineer in you have to get the
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.360]  science right before you start messing about the planet in that way and you
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.360]  may remember that 30 years ago when everybody was talking about global
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.680]  cooling and we were told by the usual suspects the same usual suspects that
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.960]  are now telling us about global warming that global cooling was the big
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:13.600]  problem they were proposing to put carbon dust soot all over Siberia and all
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:20.240]  over the Arctic and Greenland so as to darken the the ground and allow more
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:25.220]  sunlight to come in melt a bit more ice and keep us a bit warmer and thank
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:29.200]  goodness they didn't do that because now they're saying well what we need to do is
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.160]  the opposite geoengineering we need to have great silver umbrellas up in space
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.240]  we need to be seeding the atmosphere with particles that will reflect the
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.000]  light such as sulfur dioxide which until recently they've been taking out of the
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.040]  atmosphere and so round and around it goes with scientific institutions and
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.400]  universities and politicians getting enormous grants from taxpayers whether
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:01.600]  the taxpayers like it or not to fund ever more absurd projects and all as the
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.680]  science behind the scare terminally collapses well well Lord Monkton that
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:11.800]  was my next point is Bill Gates has patented literally dozens of these he's
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:18.560]  seeking funds for anti-hurricane machines for global aluminum dioxide
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.920]  barium spraying campaigns they admit they've been testing this for decades and
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.600]  one fellow back in the early 90s won a Nobel Prize for it but as you said they
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.040]  have no idea because of the complex weather interactions of whether it's
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.440]  gonna heat up or cool off the as you know the UN last year at Copenhagen had a
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.240]  declaration that the Sun doesn't affect climate because you know they have to
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.440]  deny that so they can then play God here but I mean isn't this also just a
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.040]  giant boondoggle where they demand billions of dollars to save us by by
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.840]  controlling our climate when when they admit they they might be able to
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.360]  manipulate it from time to time but overall they have no idea what they're
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.920]  doing in the aggregate they haven't got a clue what they're doing we've known
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:06.480]  since 1963 that trying to predict what the climate's going to do next for more
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.920]  than a few weeks out is impossible by any method it's mathematically proven that
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.360]  you can't do it and yet here are these nincompoops trying to tell us that they
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.160]  can tell us exactly what's going to happen to the climate if we do what
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.160]  we're doing at the moment which is getting on with our lives and burning
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:28.440]  fossil fuels and generating CO2 and then they say but of course if they do
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.760]  what they would like us to pay for then it's all going to change and they can
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.600]  predict this well no they can't it's been long established that they can't make
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.600]  that kind of prediction Lord Monty let's cut to the chase on that one issue of
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.960]  carbon dioxide yeah I mean they've done studies where they can tell crowds the
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.960]  scientific name of water dihydrogen monoxide and over 90% will sign a form
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.640]  including educated people saying ban water it's a toxic waste the same thing
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.560]  with the scientific name for table salt most people will sign a form saying
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.320]  ban it if they're given the scientific name people confuse carbon dioxide with
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.360]  a dangerous gas carbon monoxide but from the basic confirmed research that
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.160]  I've seen from the mud flats and the ice caps and the studies carbon dioxide has
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.440]  been as much as 14 times higher than it is now and all of the controlled studies
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:24.720]  they've done show that plants grow better live longer higher crop yields that
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.960]  then animals put off more carbon dioxide for the plants they give us more
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:36.000]  oxygen and that the earth is really in in this geological and and climatic
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.760]  phase in an oxygen and carbon dioxide starved state and that carbon dioxide is
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.320]  actually good for life that is completely correct in all respect in fact if
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.640]  you go back to the Jurassic era 175 million years ago you're too young
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.240]  Alex but those of us who were around at the time remember it well and at that
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:01.120]  time there was as you say 14 15 16 times as much fear to in the atmosphere as
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.840]  there is today and yet here we all are go back a little further to the Cambrian
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.840]  era 550 million years ago and at that time there was 20 times as much carbon
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.320]  dioxide as there is today go back another couple of hundred million years to the
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:22.560]  neo protozoic era in the early pre Cambrian and at that time get this there
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:29.880]  was 773 times as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there is today about
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.640]  a third of the atmosphere at that time was carbon dioxide and yet here we all
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.680]  are the oceans did not acidify and melt all the creatures all of this bedwetting
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.720]  about how the world is going to come to an end because we have changed over the
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.120]  last 260 years the atmospheric composition by naught point zero one
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:55.920]  percent and that's the entire change that we've made by adding carbon dioxide
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.720]  to it we've added an equivalent of naught point zero one percent of the
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.880]  atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide this is simply not enough to cause a
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.680]  major change in the earth's temperature and the big question in climate
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:17.280]  science is how much of a change can this very very small increase in carbon
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.360]  dioxide concentration actually cause and all the researchers like these those
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.720]  ones at the conference in erity of the World Federation of Scientists who do
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.960]  this by measurement and observation conclude that if you double the co2
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.800]  concentration then you get an increase in temperature around two Fahrenheit
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.520]  perfectly harmless generally beneficial and the other thing is as you
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.840]  rightly said co2 increases crop yield in fact if we double the co2 compare with
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:51.400]  today the yields of most staple crops would increase by up to 40% and they
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:55.760]  will be able to grow crops in areas that are now too dry the fact is that as Professor
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:01.600]  Will Happer of Princeton University said in testimony in front of Congress just a
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:07.720]  few months ago we are starved of co2 at the moment plants would like to get a
[01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:12.280]  whole lot more of it if they could and one of the things we can observe from
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:19.080]  space with satellite is that the net primary productivity of plants which is
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:24.320]  very much a function of their ability to photosynthesize and of course co2 is an
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.160]  essential ingredient in photosynthesis net primary productivity of plants is
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:34.880]  already visibly rising this is a very good thing that is the most direct way
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:39.960]  of greening the earth and those who really believe in making the earth green
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:44.880]  would want a whole lot more carbon dioxide and not a whole lot less so if
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.680]  we were going to have geoengineering and we do have this observable fact
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.840]  dealing with carbon dioxide then the plants create more oxygen then we would
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:57.240]  actually have giant factories terraforming geoengineering putting out
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:03.800]  more carbon dioxide you get the plants of course take in carbon dioxide and
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.800]  oxygen if we put it out they take it in that makes the plants grow more the
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:14.600]  more coal fired power stations China opens up and it's planning to open up
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:21.040]  one or two coal fired power stations every week between now and the year 2030
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.760]  and they know they've got to do this to get their people out of poverty and
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.200]  hence stabilize their population that's what they're going to do the Chinese
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.800]  ambassador to Italy and his scientific and technical counselor came from Rome
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:38.000]  to Sicily to attend our conference on planetary emergency the scientific
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.920]  counselor sat in on my presentation and afterwards he said look I want full
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:48.600]  details of what you have just shown us because you've shown that the IPCC the
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.600]  official body looking at the UN at this science has been bending the data and
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.160]  getting its sums wrong and fudging things and producing false graphs and he said
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:03.120]  your own calculations which seem very straightforward are clearly demonstrating
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:09.080]  that we don't have a problem he said this has a major implication for China we
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:13.600]  really really need to see this and so I sent him the background materials for my
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.520]  talk etc and there's no doubt that China has got the point in Copenhagen last year
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.200]  I got in to the last day of the conference I was one of the very few
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:26.200]  observers who were let in 30,000 observers were registered to be let in
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.280]  only a dozen actually got in I was one of them and I watched Wen Jabao who is the
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:36.360]  Chinese president of the State Council of China kind of Chinese Prime Minister
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:42.240]  if you like and he had spent 55 minutes with President Obama bullying him
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:47.280]  trying to persuade him that what he should do is to shut China's economy
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.360]  down in the name of saving the planet and when Jabao came straight out on the
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:57.000]  stage and he said I'm not going to do it I'm not going to put China's economic
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.520]  growth and lifting my people out of poverty in any way at risk if you in
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:06.800]  the West want to put your economies at risk send your business to us so that
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.840]  we do your manufacturers we'll happily take the business on but don't tell us
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:15.200]  we can't do it what you've already done and he was very firm and very clear
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:22.200]  about it however watch this Alex you may have noticed that very quietly but very
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.320]  definitely in the last six months both in Britain and in the United States
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.160]  official statements were made at the highest level President Obama there are
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:36.480]  foreign secretary here for the first time explicitly recognizing China's
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:41.960]  occupation of Tibet and what I think may be going on is that behind the scenes
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:47.720]  they may have persuaded China to keep her powder dry until Cancun and then to
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:51.760]  agree to go along with the so-called process by which we established the
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:56.080]  world government of which you and I have often talked the unelected you that
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.000]  was my next point is that China had said no to the Cuban hanging and then
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.960]  suddenly they've been finding factories they've been saying they may demolish
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:09.960]  factories they're saying they may start trying to implement carbon taxes there
[01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.800]  in their economy so we're seeing a shift yes and I think it's exactly the same
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:19.720]  as what was done with Russia because as you know in 2004 the Russian Academy of
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:25.800]  Sciences looked at all this nonsense and doctor Ilya Ilarionov who is the
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:30.480]  chairman of the it was then the chairman the Russian Academy of Sciences made a
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.880]  great speech after hearing so David King and other worldies from Britain telling
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:38.280]  him how terrible warming was saying it was quite clear that none of these
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.840]  people knew any science at all the whole thing was nonsense and Russia would not
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.920]  be playing any part of this nonsense and David King flounced out in the half
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.760]  and came back to the UK and was promptly sacked but what then happened is Tony
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:57.680]  Blair had a meeting with gasputed and he said look if you would like to join the
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:03.160]  World Trade Organization on favorable terms and all you have to do is at least
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.960]  say that you believe in this global warming stuff even if in fact you carry
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:10.440]  on digging up your methane gas and piping it to Europe all the other things you
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:14.360]  want to do but if you at least say you believe that global warming is going to
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.840]  be terrible then we'll let you join the World Trade Organization and that is
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:23.360]  exactly what happened within six months Ilarionov was gone from the world from
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.240]  the Academy of Sciences because he wasn't prepared to change his tune and
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.840]  Putin appointed somebody else more agreeable to the new political reality
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:34.560]  and I think they've done exactly the same with China I think they've they've
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.880]  quietly agreed behind the scenes that they would go public Britain and America
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:45.400]  and say to China okay we acknowledge publicly that Tibet belongs to China
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.240]  well of course it doesn't it belongs to the people of Tibet but don't try
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.480]  telling that to our government or yours because they don't care about the people
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.480]  of Tibet anymore they care about playing politics and I'll tell you why they're
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.760]  doing it I tell you why they're going to these drastic lengths to kick human
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:05.680]  rights in the teeth to kick the people of Tibet in the teeth to kick the people
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:11.480]  of Russia in the teeth why are they doing this because they know by now that
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:16.160]  they've got it wrong on the science they all panicked and galloped off in the same
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.800]  direction because it meant more taxes more regulation more powers by
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:25.320]  politicians to save us from ourselves at our own expense that's what they were
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:31.720]  doing and they now know that they got it wrong and they know that the only hope
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.760]  of it not becoming blindingly obvious to everyone that they got it wrong the
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:42.400]  entire governing class of the world got it wrong is actually to put in the
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.720]  measures that they want to put in to shut the world's economy particularly the
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.040]  West economies down of course ultimately this is the real objective it's a
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:56.360]  shut down the economies of the West and then when the warming that they had
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.760]  predicted doesn't happen because by now they know perfectly well it isn't going
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.520]  to happen regardless of whether we've burned lots of CO2 or not then they
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:09.480]  will say there you are our measures worked we had it right all along that's
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.840]  the game they're playing now it's a strategy of complete desperation they
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:17.520]  know they've got it wrong they know they're beginning to be found out the
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.240]  climategate emails the endless revelations from the IPCC these failed
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.640]  reports where they made huge errors sometimes deliberate and refused for
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.560]  years to correct them until it became impossible to hold the line anymore all
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:36.040]  of these things have embarrassed world governments hugely because government
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:40.920]  don't ever like to admit that they got something wrong and when they have all
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:46.680]  bet the farm on this global warming thing as strongly as they have you can
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.600]  see how very very difficult it has become for any of them to back off from
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.280]  their positions now of course the environmental extremist people like
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.640]  Greenpeace they're not going to back off because they depend absolutely on
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.880]  global warming being acknowledged as real for about three quarters of their
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.080]  funding well Christopher hold on just a second we're going to break in a moment
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.040]  I want to get into your deep research on their latest stratagem to bring this
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.040]  deception forward and from your deep research really quantify who the
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.880]  leadership of these people are and what their world population reduction in game
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:27.320]  is and this new scientific tyranny where they suppress our development but then
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.320]  allow their select corporations and government groups to move forward the
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:36.560]  website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org scienceandpublicpolicy.org
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.160]  literally everything he said in the last decade has now been admitted
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:46.200]  exactly as he said it I mean it's devastating that they're okay we did
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.000]  fake the Himalayas melting we did lie about the rainforest we did lie about
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.280]  the polar bears we did premeditatedly lie about you know CO2 causing all this
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.120]  warming I mean it's incredible but we've got about two minutes till break
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.640]  briefly we've got all these IPCC authors coming out saying it's a fraud we've got
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:07.240]  Pechari admitting all this stuff can you just briefly recap their total
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:11.200]  implosion of credibility that's happened the last two months well here's a very nice
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.560]  little example of it Pechari was due to come to a conference that I attended in
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:21.400]  in southern India just a few days ago and I was speaking at the conference as
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.280]  was professor Fred Singer and when Pechari heard that we were going to be
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.880]  there as well as the usual suspect saying was all going to be terrible he
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.440]  refused to come because he knows that as a railroad engineer he is totally
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:38.640]  incapable of maintaining an argument on climate he knows he doesn't know enough
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:45.680]  about it but the other thing was that his so-called bogus charity TERI which
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.680]  operates out of India and also has a subdivision in London that had agreed to
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:56.440]  put a million rupees of funding into the conference organized as it was by a
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.320]  religious foundation three days before the conference began
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.600]  Terry pulled out it's funding on Pechari's instructions saying that they
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.680]  were unhappy that skeptics such as Singer and Moncton were being allowed to
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.280]  have their say at this conference now that is going to get them in trouble
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:17.640]  with the charity commissions not only in India but also in London where they
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:22.760]  have already been caught out filing bogus accounts for three years grossly
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:28.160]  undeclaring Lord Moncton isn't that a form of bribery to to tell conferences we
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.720]  won't give you the money if you have people critical of us at the event it
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:37.520]  is entirely against the charity law as well as being a form of bribery and
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:43.640]  Pechari ought to go to jail for it but of course these people as they they know
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.720]  now they're untouchable stay there Lord Moncton's our guests we got to go to

[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:06.840]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.880]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.280]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:23.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:34.800]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:39.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:45.960]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.840]  moment of science and public policy.org an essential site do you understand
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.920]  that the globalist the one-worlders openly want world government they have
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:39.720]  put their entire investment in global domination through this pseudo religion
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.880]  the UN admits it they're a bunch of atheists but they say people need a
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:47.320]  religion it's gonna be of the earth we're gonna dictate everything we're gonna
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:52.160]  decide if you can have a factory have a plant have a job the West has to make
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:57.680]  all the cuts India and China and Mexico and 160 other countries zero cuts they
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.160]  just got to go along with it but the third world itself is to have its
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:06.120]  resources cut off that will cause massive death and degradation we cover
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.560]  all of this in my seminal documentary Endgame blueprint for global enslavement
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:15.400]  available on DVD at info wars.com show it to everyone you know make copies of
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:19.040]  it Aaron on access television give it to your local county commissioners and

[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:37.040]  the carbon taxes all of it is covered in this film the Obama deception you get

[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.680]  being criticized being attacked them calling for your arrest in major
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:06.520]  newspapers as a climate denier and everything confirmed and now you're at
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:10.480]  the most prestigious scientific forums in the world and they're agreeing with
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.360]  you you're meeting with the top science advisor to the Chinese government
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:19.320]  waking them up I mean the point is when we do take the field against oppression
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:25.440]  and tyranny and lies and neo-surfdom we are able to defeat it and just just your
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:31.720]  spirit of resistance is a great example to us all so I want to thank you for my
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:35.720]  family and for my listeners for your tireless efforts I know you crisscross
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:40.400]  the planet at your own expense fighting these people well that's very very kind
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:45.920]  of you not a word of that is really deserved but much appreciated nonetheless
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:49.880]  and the thing is that that you may remember that a few months ago you
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.000]  talking about how I get attacked a lot yes they're at this all the time now
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.160]  they've realized I'm dangerous to them and so they're now trying to take me
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.800]  apart first of all personally and and endless rather poisonous accusations
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.280]  being made and now at last they're beginning to say well let's see if we
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:11.320]  can attack him scientifically do you remember that shrimp-like character
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:16.840]  professor Abraham from Minnesota yes and who spent eight months preparing an
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:22.760]  83-minute diatribe calling me everything from a fraud to a trickster to be by
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.920]  somebody who made up data who fabricated data who misrepresented
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.760]  scientists work etc etc over and over again he libeled me well this
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.720]  insignificant character wholly unworthy to be even the minor associate professor
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:43.520]  that he is in a two-bit Catholic Bible College in Minnesota he has now had to
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:50.120]  back off completely because I produced an 84 page letter refuting every lie
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.840]  that he had put out in his horrible broadcast and you can still get his
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:01.800]  horrible broadcast published by this two-bit three-legged four four-eyed
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:09.000]  five-aside 678th rate Bible College that on its servers but nobody now takes it
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.680]  seriously he and the Bible College and the president of the Bible College a
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:17.840]  creepy individual who fails to investigate this matter when he was
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:24.720]  asked to do so not only by me but also by many of your own listeners they have
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.960]  now had to back off into a corner and accept that nobody now takes them
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:34.880]  seriously as an academic institution at all parents are saying to their
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:42.880]  children don't go to that Bible College and Thomas Bible College in Minnesota
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.920]  it's not a fit place for people to get a proper education you will be taught by
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:54.960]  liars frauds and cheats so they have now backed off into a corner they're licking
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.760]  their wounds they're waiting imminently for the libel writ from me which will
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:04.720]  finally put them and their associate professor out of business but they have
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:09.880]  now really had to accept that he lied they've had to accept that he lied
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:14.640]  repeatedly they've had to accept that he and they had a fair chance to have this
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.840]  put right and they failed to do so when I gave them the chance to do so
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:23.240]  privately so now they're treated to gales of laughter all around the world as
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:29.760]  people read this very detailed point-by-point scientific refutation that
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:35.160]  I have given of this so-called joke professor this cardboard professors this
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:40.360]  prawn-like professors ridiculous attempt at a scientific attack on me the guy
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:45.280]  isn't even a climate scientist he's a professor of heat transfer or some such
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:50.200]  thing well he's not being invited which they never do I mean he's not being
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:54.320]  invited like you to the World Federation of Scientists now now expanding on this
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.560]  though yeah what are their counter strikes because they're still going
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.720]  forward with their climate cult they're still brainwashing the children in
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.720]  public and private schools worldwide they're still going ahead the EPA says
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:10.680]  they're implementing the carbon taxes by hooker by crook how a how are they
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:15.400]  counter striking and be how do we defeat them right I think what is
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.760]  happening is that the Republican Party which as recently as two years ago was
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.240]  saying to me well of course we can't argue with them on the science but on the
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:27.960]  economics what they say makes no sense they have now realized that the science
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.360]  is wrong I have testified several times in front of Congress many other
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:39.080]  researchers and scientists who are skeptical of the extremists claims have
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:45.200]  also testified there and it has become quite apparent that the Democrats simply
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.560]  want to believe in this global warming stuff not because it's true but because
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:54.360]  it's politically expedient and financially profitable that's what it's
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.840]  all about they don't care what the scientific truth is but the Republicans
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:04.320]  now do they are now looking very very hard at the science and here if the IPCC
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:08.520]  and railroad engineer Patchouli its chairman is listening is what's going
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.160]  to happen next at the midterm elections in November and it's not for me to tell
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:18.480]  you which way to vote but you know what I'm thinking it is very likely that the
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.400]  Republicans are going to recapture the house and they will come closer to
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.320]  recapturing the Senate though my guess is they won't quite make that now when
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:34.640]  they do recapture the house there will no longer be any serious opposition to
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:40.720]  the idea that cap and trade is dead and the Senate won't pass a cap and trade
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.240]  bill house won't pass one that is not going to happen what will happen instead
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:50.920]  is that the Murkowski resolution in the Senate that would have extinguished the
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:56.840]  EPA's right to trample around issuing huge taxes in the name of saving the
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:01.400]  planet that will be brought forward again this time it will carry and then of
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.080]  course it can still be vetoed by the president but then let him veto it and
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.480]  let him veto it over and over and over again that's what they're going to do
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:16.040]  because every time he personally vetoes it then he is making the EPA's actions
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:21.680]  his own and the electorate will not thank him for it those candidates who have
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:26.440]  spoken out so far in the election in the primaries against this global warming
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.760]  nonsense have done far better than the true believers who pretend to go on
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:34.360]  believing it so gradually the politicians are saying we're not playing
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:40.040]  now if America doesn't play if America doesn't go for cabin tax and it's now
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:45.240]  looking clearer that it won't subject only to the Democrats trying to do
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.700]  something cheesy during the lame ducks session the kind of thing that senator
[01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:53.840]  Kerry has already been saying they're going to try to do well they may try to
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.600]  do that but if they do once again the electorate will take note and Obama will
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:02.560]  find that when he faces election again in another two years time he will be out
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:10.080]  on his ear big time if the the US Democrats try to play that kind of game
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:15.320]  during the lame duck session force legislation through on the vote of
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.440]  senators and congressmen who have already lost their seats and therefore have
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.160]  nothing to lose by creating maximal damage to the nation they had sworn
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:29.800]  an oath to serve that's what they'll try to do but they will be forestalled if
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.600]  they're not forestalled that's the end of Obama's chance of reelection if they
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.600]  are forestalled that's the end of the process of trying to get a world
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:42.440]  government but it's up to individuals at their county cities and states to
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.640]  route these people out because even though it's been exposed internationally
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.560]  nationally by yourself and others and even though more and more their program
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:55.160]  is in trouble they are accelerating it in a sneaky way at the local level with
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:59.920]  their brainwashing their local carbon taxes environmental taxes and that's up
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.280]  to all of us individually to go to the school boards to go to the city council
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:09.400]  meetings and to present all of the admissions now that this is a fraud and
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:13.560]  all of the admissions that it'll cause massive third-world starvation and death
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:18.960]  and explain this is really a eugenics move for world population reduction and
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:23.640]  Lord Moncton I want to get to that but first I wanted to play a video clip from
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:28.520]  a few years ago put out by Greenpeace financed by these big foundations
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.640]  because now they're issuing more videos like this and Bill Gates who's funding
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:37.000]  global warming propaganda is saying yes we're gonna have death panels get rid of
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.440]  grandma so that we can hire 10 teachers so we're more and more seeing that the
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:48.280]  eugenics crowd the euthanasia crowd the environmental crowd this is all one big
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.920]  group and I wanted to get your statement on the fact that the New York Times is
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:57.600]  now coming out telling children in in New York Times published workbooks
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:02.840]  tattle on your parents report on them tell them they shouldn't take a hot bath
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:07.920]  or shouldn't run the water when they brush their teeth mirroring what Prince
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:12.440]  Charles has been saying about don't take a bath you know take a shower I mean
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:19.400]  it's so insane so I wanted to play this chilling clip of this youth sternly
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:24.120]  telling his parents and adults that we're coming after you and again this
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:28.480]  mirrors all the new press reports of the world's too stupid to accept carbon
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.200]  taxes we've got to become authoritarian and force this through for the good of
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:36.800]  the earth they're now becoming nakedly authoritarian they're not just calling
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:42.640]  for your arrest they're they're basically in you waiting or or or or or or getting at
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:47.720]  I'm inventing words here there they're they're basically saying we may get
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:52.840]  violent with you now here's that clip the scientific community released a
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:58.000]  report that proves beyond a doubt that the earth is getting warmer this global
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.320]  warming is caused by things you grown-ups do and by the things you don't if
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.840]  drastic measures aren't taken soon by the time I grow up there won't be any
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:12.160]  fish left in the sea rainforests and clean air will be a thing of the past
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:19.040]  the polar ice caps will be gone oceans will rise entire countries will disappear
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:25.760]  life will change in ways you can't even imagine it could be famine worldwide
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:32.120]  epidemics life expectancy will be lower and we're not just talking about the
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:39.080]  future we're talking about my future but this is no surprise you idols have
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.600]  known about this for years and though you could have done something about it you
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:48.600]  haven't you can say it's not my problem you can say I won't be around in 50
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:54.840]  years but from now on you can't say I didn't know starting today the lines
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:01.560]  are drawn you have to choose sides either your for my future or you're
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:09.480]  against it you're a friend or you're an enemy it may just be a kid today but
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:14.720]  tomorrow will be different this is the last time I'll be talking to you adults
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:20.080]  you've had your chance to fix this problem now we have ours we won't be
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:28.000]  cute we won't be patronized and we will not be denied our future join the
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.640]  energy revolution Greenpeace so this is literally the equivalent of malice
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.800]  youth brigades jogging down the street with their red flags and if you see the
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:44.120]  face of this child which is a malevolent bitter unwashed face yes you can see what
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:50.120]  thoroughly nasty indeed Nazi propaganda this is the Greenpeace now is no
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.160]  better than the Nazi movement and they're behaving in exactly the same way
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:58.000]  using very very similar propaganda techniques it's an extremely worrying
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.080]  trend in Europe you may be interested to know they're planning to set up an
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:07.600]  environmental criminal court and the aim of that environmental criminal court
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:14.160]  will be that anyone who dares to say like you or me that global warming is
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.760]  has been oversold and it's going to happen but not as much as the official
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:24.880]  documents say can be arrested using the European arrest warrant which has
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:31.120]  already seen 3000 British citizens taken without evidence from their beds at three
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.880]  in the morning and deported to various European countries by the European
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.760]  dictatorship you know we are already a police state it's already happening to
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.520]  us and this environmental criminal court is about to be set up and that too will
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.200]  have the powers to issue arrest warrants against British citizens without
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.120]  evidence under the European arrest warrant procedure that's what it is
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.000]  happening here and it is and the UN is working on similar structures
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.160]  internationally so that anyone who in future goes on convincing people
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:10.400]  scientifically that this is nonsense using scientific arguments and facts and
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.600]  data and as you've rightly said being proven right time and again when the
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:18.800]  true believers in the new religion of people want your proven wrong people
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:24.800]  like us can and not very long from now unless we really fight this will be
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:31.280]  arrested locked up and if James Hansen gets his way killed for what he calls
[01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:36.680]  high crimes against humanity for which the penalty is death he has been
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:41.400]  calling in effect for the death penalty for those who dare to disagree with him
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.440]  on global warming that is how serious this is we're dealing with people who in
[01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:52.880]  their increasing desperation can no longer rely upon argument because their
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:58.920]  case has never been based on it instead they can only rely on force and it's
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.400]  force that they're now using increasingly to try to kick people into
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:08.880]  line that's what the EPA is doing that's what Obama wants to do so far the
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.800]  only real obstacle worldwide to this new dictatorship and it is a Nazi
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.760]  dictatorship it's just as nasty as that it's the same techniques it's the same
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:25.200]  arbitrary arrest well Hitler was an environmentalist he was indeed and but
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:28.240]  he he was he was therefore perfectly willing he was perfectly willing to

[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:12.920]  journalist coming on later to get into the fact that we're seeing more and more
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:18.520]  US troops killed you know the war is supposedly over in Iraq Lord Monkton I
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:21.800]  want listeners especially new ones understand we're not joking around
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.480]  about this they're openly saying they want to arrest us they want to send
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:29.840]  people to prison for the tiniest of environmental crimes this is their
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:35.080]  tyranny and we were talking during the break you talked about how they tried
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:39.280]  to prosecute and use the terrorism unit for whoever leaked the East Anglia
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:44.800]  emails proving they knew it was a fraud yes the university called in the police
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:52.520]  and the police sent in not an ordinary investigating unit you know the IT unit
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:58.000]  or something like that they sent in the domestic terrorism unit of the serious
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:05.680]  organized crime agency because now in Britain anyone who dares to say or do
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:10.720]  anything that questions global warming even on the soundest of scientific
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:16.080]  bases is regarded as a terrorist a threat to the state and somebody who
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.000]  should be locked up and the only reason they haven't locked us up yet is that
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.120]  they know they aren't yet quite far enough in control of this subject to get
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:30.400]  away with it they know that if this goes anywhere near a court of law and it
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:35.680]  would still have to for the moment anyway then they would have to produce
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.720]  evidence and of course that we could then produce the evidence showing by
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:43.680]  measurement and observation that global warming is not going to be a global
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:48.000]  crisis the moment a court hears that evidence is going to say how can you
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.440]  possibly accuse people who are producing serious scientific evidence like this of
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:56.240]  being terrorists but let's stop right there but I mean let's stop there
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:59.920]  briefly we're almost out of time I mean if you had to simply in one minute
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:07.920]  state free humanities position and the position of these these tyrants I mean
[01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:13.680]  how much trouble are they in they are very close to losing it in every way
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:19.440]  they've lost the argument they've lost the public they've lost the debate they've
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:24.160]  lost the United States I think they've still lost China notwithstanding the
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:29.280]  concession on Tibet which I'm quite sure was connected with climate change and it
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.640]  is great they've lost all these things and in their growing desperation they
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:40.080]  are thrashing around and lashing out in all directions but that is what a dying
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:47.600]  beast does and we may perhaps be it's not months perhaps years away from seeing
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:53.800]  this beast finally die and this will do the international extremist left great
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:57.680]  harm they should not have backed the wrong horse on this one they should have
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.240]  got off long ago but they stayed with it and now they're about to come last in
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:08.920]  the race and once again there is still the chance that we can keep the world
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:14.360]  free and democratic and the main reason why is that your Congress and your
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.080]  Constitution stands whether Obama likes it or not whether anybody else likes to
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:25.920]  not in the way of anyone who dares to take not only your freedoms as Americans
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.040]  but our freedoms in the rest of the world away so God bless your Congress God
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:35.880]  bless your Constitution and God bless America in closing I would just ask you
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.280]  this I mean looking at this if we're able to defeat them 20 30 years from now
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.960]  in history they will be known as phase two of the Nazis repackaged in a
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.440]  liberal shell that fail they'll be known as the eugenicists they really were
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:56.040]  that's quite true what is curious is that the policies they advocate would inevitably have
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.040]  the consequence of increasing the world's population dramatically if you make
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:03.960]  people poorer and that's what their measure intended to do then you raise
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:08.440]  their populations make them richer as our policies are tended to do and their
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:13.160]  populations stabilized they've got it completely wrong as they have everything
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:17.240]  else in this debate and the Royal Commission on Population in 49 actually
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:20.360]  found that they said we can industrialize these people but that would make
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.360]  them a military threat so we'll just we'll just let them live in squalor and
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.960]  have eight kids and you know just hope that most of them die and now they want
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:30.760]  to cut the carbon off to these people and hope that'll cause an implosion Lord
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.560]  Moncton thank you so much for spending time with us science and public policy

[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:03.840]  joins us so that is coming up I want to get into some world news I want to get
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:08.800]  into some more news on the economy in the next segment I said I'd get more into
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:12.440]  eugenics news we covered a lot of that with montan but we'll do that before the
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:17.680]  guest joins us but during the first hour Matt Ryan one of the producers ran in
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:21.960]  here and he said you got to see this because I just been talking about how
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:29.840]  the government does these drills this has been going on for at least 14 years
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:33.800]  that I know I've been on there for about a year when I started getting article
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:39.800]  sentiment cutouts from you know newspapers from listeners everywhere where
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:46.240]  they do unannounced drills and they do it in elementary middle school high
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:53.000]  school college they do it at businesses there was a case of course a chain of
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:58.600]  drugstores where they did a drill and did a fake robbery as part of the
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:05.440]  insurance company and they didn't tell him it was a fake armed robbery and the
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:10.280]  person came in and said give me the money give me the drugs and this is done
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.960]  to create the community perception that there are terrorists everywhere when you
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:18.640]  read the psych warfare manuals that are even public when they do drills and
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:21.840]  urban warfare drills and unannounced military drills and unannounced
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:29.240]  takeovers of schools most the time the news runs with it the first day locally
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:33.520]  like it's a real terror attack but you'll always get tipped off that it
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:38.760]  wasn't real because it's never on national news you'll hear you know
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:45.400]  terrorists have nuclear spill on South IH 35 or somebody hits the DPS office in
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:53.160]  north Austin with bio weapon people are sick and I went out there and this was
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:57.880]  like five hours into it happening up at the DPS and I noticed it wasn't on
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:00.840]  national news because they've been given the word it wasn't real it was a
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:05.120]  simulation they only do it regionally they'll announce home schoolers of
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:08.840]  attack to school they'll announce and they'll go in the school and tell the
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:14.400]  kids it's real too and then they'll use it for a few hours on TV five six seven
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:17.920]  hours sometimes and the next day the paper will say oh it was just a drill
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:24.440]  but but but the local papers this is a formula that I began to observe 13 14
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:28.120]  years ago that's now an admitted formula you know I can reverse engineer it by
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:31.960]  watching it but then later we even get the documents the federal grants where
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:35.080]  the feds say we're gonna give you all this money for squad cars or whatever
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:41.080]  but you've got to do drills this way and it's meant to create the perception
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:48.560]  that terrorists are literally everywhere and that terrorists are coming to get
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:54.280]  you and in almost all of these drills I'd say less than 10% they have a guy
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:04:00.600]  with a turban on or Arab you know Bedouin type headdress you know no be one
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.920]  Kenobi outfit or whatever we've been to some drills we've covered some drills
[02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:12.480]  they had one out at Mabry a few months ago camp Mabry and you know they were
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:16.840]  simulating fighting Arabs out there but less than 10% of the time is at Arabs
[02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:21.600]  that's just the public reason they have this police state over 90% of the time
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:28.040]  gun owners returning veterans libertarians conservatives how many
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:31.240]  times we've seen the New York Times and others report oh they're explorer
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:35.320]  scouts are trained to take on disgruntled vets in this drill they took out the
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:40.280]  terrorist who wouldn't turn his guns in so when we come back here's another one
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:46.000]  of these where they even had kids at the school who were shot up in a simulation
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.840]  who knew it was part of a drill but they didn't tell the other children it was
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:55.240]  part of a drill to create massive psychological trauma this is mind
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:05:01.680]  control going on on a mass scale to create the perception the terrorism is real you've
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:05.840]  heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:09.800]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:12.960]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:17.720]  deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:22.320]  Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:26.440]  silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:30.320]  also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to

[02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:05.720]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:09.520]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:13.880]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:18.240]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:22.680]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:27.440]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:09.000]  you are obsolete mr. Wordsworth why no man is obsolete you have no function mr.
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:13.320]  Wordsworth you're an anachronism like a ghost from another time I am nothing
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.880]  more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:23.720]  you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect ugly misforn little creature who
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:30.760]  has no purpose here no meaning I am a human being words mr. Wordsworth they
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:36.800]  have no substance and no dimension like air like a wind I don't care I tell you
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:43.440]  I don't care I'm a human being I exist if I speak one for a love that thought
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:46.600]  lives even after I'm shoveled in my grave
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:55.440]  delusions mr. Wordsworth delusions that you injected in your veins to make you think you have a strength
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:09:00.800]  but you have no strength at all you have nothing but spindly limbs and a green and the
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:08.800]  state has no use for your time resistance to tyrants his obedience to God it's
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:16.880]  Alex Jones what does Bill Gates say kill the old lady we can hire 10 teachers
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.960]  with that money you're obsolete no we're not obsolete we know what you are
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:27.200]  doing they get in the economy here in a moment but they've been having drills
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:32.040]  for at least 14 years that I know of coast to coast where they unannounce
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:38.880]  come into a school they'll tell elementary students ages 5 to 10 march out on
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:43.840]  the front lawn they'll blow up a car in front of them set it on fire they'll
[02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:47.680]  throw buckets of fake blood on kids that they have told what's happening they'll
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:51.760]  have them run out crying in front of the children this is to demonize the Second
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.120]  Amendment this is to create incredible trauma in an article after article the
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:59.960]  children urinate on themselves in some cases they make them stay in their class
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:04.440]  all day and make them go in the to the bathroom in track cans in front of the
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:08.920]  students and don't give them lunch as part of the mind control trauma this is
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:16.280]  out of WPSD local six news out of Kentucky and again we see these articles
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:24.840]  every week and it says that they they got a small group of the students at the
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:29.720]  technical college they do this at private businesses as well to play the part
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:33.720]  of being shot and killed fake blood splattering and they go on to say we want
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:37.760]  everybody's attention this could happen at any given time and we want to be
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:41.840]  prepared for it and the SWAT practice taking over what would you do if some
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:45.640]  students who who are worried about shootings or whatever that are pretty
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:49.640]  much non-existent or have a gun or one of another police officer was there did
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:53.880]  know it was part of a drill oh that happened in Dallas a few years ago they
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:57.720]  shot cop of the year in the head that another drill a few years before that in
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:06.480]  Michigan where the cop shot himself oh yeah and so here is the newscast where
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:12.800]  they just come right out in the open with this brazen brainwashing and admit
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:17.160]  that they didn't tell the majority of the students or teachers professors what
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:24.080]  was going on this is mind control and they have other drills where they say
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:30.640]  it's real for a few hours half a day a day this is mind control because there's
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:33.640]  no real terrorism that really isn't manufactured that we've seen in this
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:39.560]  country so they manufacture the idea of it they've got every police department
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:44.160]  the country training to take on veterans that plan to bomb them they're
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:51.960]  training youth brigades for this this is authoritarian mass reeducation let's go
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:56.720]  ahead and play this newscast and analyze it here it is well this was a mock drill
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.560]  today law enforcement spared no detail in making sure everything seemed
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:06.120]  realistic today even down to the wounds that we saw on students they say
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:12.240]  anything to get them and first responders better prepared a quiet
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:19.680]  fall morning at a local college campus then the silence shattered by gunshots
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:28.280]  on phase the gunman continued on a shooting spree I saw the shooter walking
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:33.240]  across the yard student Jackson Irvin is an eyewitness the first two rounds were
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:37.160]  louder than the other ones and it scared the holy crap out of me and that's
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.560]  exactly the reaction Paducah police captain Brandon Barnhill is looking for
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:44.160]  and we wanted to get everybody's attention we want everybody to know
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:47.800]  this is something that could happen at any given time and we have to be
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:52.920]  prepared for it that attention wasn't hard to get an officer gun down and the
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:57.400]  SWAT team called out we put them in the absolute worst scenario they could
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:03.040]  possibly be in recognize this guy it's the shooter Rob Estes also the firearms
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:08.480]  instructor at Paducah police he spent 15 minutes evading the very team he
[02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:13.920]  trained and in the coming days he'll offer his team a critique what they
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.880]  did right what they did wrong who I could shoot who I did shoot and while
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:25.320]  Jackson Irvin was forced to watch his fellow students go by on stretchers he
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:30.600]  gets the message be ready and law enforcement gets it to at the end I
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:35.520]  had nowhere to go during today's mock drill there was one fatality and five
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.800]  were wounded but it wasn't just college students who were injured it was law
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:43.360]  enforcement as well that's because I'm told this was meant to be a learning
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:48.600]  experience for everyone tonight we're in Paducah Lauren Adams WPSD local sex
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:52.320]  well thank you Lauren now when you research this case they didn't announce
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:59.400]  to the other students and you can pull up that pull up pharmacists soos over fake
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:03.680]  robbery I want to show people that because when they do these newscasts
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.360]  sometimes they even say it's real for a while and then later they admit it's a
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:12.440]  drill and then other times well a few years ago I had a Minnesota teacher on
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.880]  where they went into the high school and told they were gonna kill her and the
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:18.240]  students and then she basically had a mental breakdown from it because they
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.360]  didn't tell her it was a drill but even on this newscast they don't make that
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:25.600]  clear but if you research it further other students didn't know you heard
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.920]  that guy go boy it scared me yeah he wasn't told there it is fake robbery
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:33.840]  prompts real lawsuit a New Jersey pharmacy technician who says she was
[02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:38.360]  traumatized when a mass gunman burst into their store demanding oxy cotton is
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:42.520]  suing her employer for arranging the mock holdup and then it goes on I mean
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:46.680]  there are literally thousands of these that I've seen and they're going on all
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:50.800]  the time that doesn't even come across our desk and so they won't tell you as
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:55.960]  a parent that your seven-year-old is gonna have their class taken over they've
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:00.880]  even tricked some of the Boy Scout groups into being part of drills where
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.120]  they're at a camp out and a guy comes with a gun or a knife I mean this is
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:08.320]  going on everywhere to create this perception that there are terrorists
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:13.560]  just all over the place and New York City and others are announcing they're
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.160]  gonna increase I saw this report yesterday in fact printed for me I never
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:23.560]  got to it you know transit authority to start anti-suicide public service
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:28.480]  announcements was the headline I believe let's see if I'm accurate but they've
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:33.960]  already had this in these cities and it's increasing suicides you have ads
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:38.000]  about don't jump in front of the train to kill yourself well people then get
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.400]  that idea in their head so it's this idea of what do you do when you get angry
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:46.240]  you don't commit suicide you go kill people at a school so they're they're
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:52.440]  always hyping suicide always always hyping death always hyping go all the
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.120]  studies show that the last 20 years of death education started in the 1990 even
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:00.920]  2020 did a piece on this that suicides go way up you go teach a bunch of 12 and
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:04.320]  13 year olds how to commit suicide when they get depressed that gives them the
[02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:10.280]  idea to do it just like it studies have shown sex education causes more sex you
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:14.440]  start showing five six seven eight nine ten year olds how to have sex they're
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:17.800]  not supposed to be thinking about that when they're eight nine years old but
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.000]  now the idea is put in their mind and so they want to go out now have sex I
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.680]  mean this is really a diabolical situation that we're talking about now
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:31.320]  I want to shift gears briefly into the economy gold rises to record on increased
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:36.480]  demand for wealth protection that's today Greenspan though is calling for more
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:41.720]  taxes we're going to talk more about this coming up in the next segment but
[02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:48.400]  gold has hit its new all-time record price and 30 plus years in the gold and
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:53.200]  silver brokerage business is Ted Anderson Ted we've got the Blimberg
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:57.880]  articles that the majority of the future options on gold for December are
[02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:01.600]  trading at $1500 an ounce more and more it's looking like that could really
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:06.040]  happen Ted it sure is as a matter of fact that $1300 an ounce is right around
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:10.040]  the corner now and I'm sure we'll get that before October even is halfway
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:14.080]  through and you know CNBC has got an article out there talking about
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:19.240]  inflation or deflation the fear is driving gold why deflation driving gold
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.160]  because they're afraid that the institution that we rely upon the
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:27.520]  whole government system the the value of the currency just collapsing in
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:31.480]  amongst itself just because of the deflationary pressure and then you
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.480]  have the inflation and even hyperinflation because you have the
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:38.440]  government trying to stop deflation it's simple in the last six months the
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:43.720]  Federal Reserve has begun monetizing debt just like Zimbabwe or Weimar
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:48.480]  Republic Germany did they started just printing money they sure are I mean
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:52.160]  they're just they're deliberately driving the value of the currency right
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:55.360]  through the floor and their problem is right now there's not enough credit
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:59.280]  worthy borrowers to take on the Federal Reserve debt you know that's why the
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.440]  money is not reaching the system that's why we don't have the that's why we
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:07.600]  don't have the velocity of the currency coming into the marketplace of I mean I
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:11.680]  I gotta tell you I'll expand in it they've created so much new money and
[02:18:11.680 --> 02:18:15.480]  we're just gonna have problems even if they stop printing money right now it
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:19.800]  would be problems so it just money's not getting out to the people it's going
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:24.960]  to the central bank so they create the crisis offer their new solution and gold
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:28.600]  is at an all-time record high where is it right now Ted well today hit a high
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:37.440]  of 1278 30 and currently right now 1274 10 silver hit a high of $20 and 82 cents
[02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:41.680]  it almost hit 21 bucks already today Alex well here's the $64 million question
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:46.000]  when I had you on two days ago you were almost out of gold and silver at prices
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000]  that you bought a month ago and so the price savings you could pass on or
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.680]  unparalleled anywhere I've ever seen I have you had to raise prices where you
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:57.280]  at I tell you what they've just edged up just a hair but they're gonna go up a
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:02.560]  lot more I do have the Frank last time I had him at 270 they're 275 right now
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:07.600]  however if you look around you'll see that that Frank has gone well over 280
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:13.000]  dollars a coin that walking Liberty half the right now at 995 they're under 10
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.600]  bucks Alex I've again I've looked through eBay if you go to the buy it now

[02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:22.400]  investigation to Homeland Security spying in Pennsylvania Homeland Security
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:27.080]  compiles list with private groups of anyone saying they want taxes cut and
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:32.320]  say you're terrorist because if you cut taxes if you force taxes to be cut that
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.800]  will hurt the government so the government is openly saying it's
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:39.360]  against the people and its own mafia organization that's up at GCN Live.com
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:45.200]  Supreme Court Justice Breyer is in the news on ABC's Good Morning America
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:49.160]  yesterday saying hey we made ban burning carans you know you don't have free
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:54.080]  speech we've got tea parties being banned in Ohio not allowed to demonstrate
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:56.480]  because the government says they're hateful not allowed to have a
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.720]  demonstration on Constitution Day all those articles are up on info wars.com
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:05.720]  and prisonplanet.com and the news and the police are reporting on this doing
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:11.080]  this like it's no big deal hey you don't have freedom okay you're the enemy if
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:15.360]  you don't lick our boots and that's because foreign corporate interests have
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:19.240]  taken over the country and they're looting it they're stripping it down I
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:22.960]  read several mainstream articles yesterday about the government moving to
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.600]  take public and private pension funds the Bloomberg reporting how they're
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:31.280]  openly in a deal with the government stealing the death benefits of veterans
[02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:36.480]  six million veterans I mean you can't make this type of stuff up I can't believe
[02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:40.960]  it I mean what's next where are they going from here and looking at the
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:45.240]  economy I wanted to ask Ted Anderson about this because you know he's been
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:51.480]  researching this forever for closures rise repossession set records CNBC CNBC
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:57.400]  reports home price double dip has begun it was never a recovery it just goes on
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:01.840]  and on gold rises a record on increased demand for wealth protection Ted not
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:04.760]  only are those great gold and silver deals great isn't even the word
[02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:11.360]  phenomenal sensational deals but it's plus why would people just stay in paper
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:17.200]  and trust this system I mean it's such a no-brainer I wish we were wrong I
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:20.600]  wish the globalists hadn't taken over I wish they weren't setting up a global
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:24.240]  band-core currency but it's now admitted I wish they weren't doing things
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:28.680]  monetarily that are designed to wreck us but they admit they are I mean we're
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:33.680]  right we've been right it's common sense it we're in a depression it's only
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:37.560]  gonna get worse and their solution is give the private Federal Reserve more
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:41.520]  power to loot everybody even more and we're here saying folks you need to get
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:45.040]  into gold and silver and it's a win-win-win you get a great deal tiny bit
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:49.000]  of profit because Ted bought it when it was low helps the network but people
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.680]  need to protect themselves with gold and silver Ted your comments on the
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:58.360]  economy yeah I mean you really spell it out very well we're living on the last
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:03.040]  days of a fiat system and the Federal Reserve for getting more power is just
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:06.880]  trying to keep it alive it's like a last-ditch effort for them to hold power
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:11.080]  people are wanting to get away from this this fiat money this money that's
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:16.160]  being printed on a thin air I mean you and I both know Alex that one elite
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:19.960]  group should not be able to produce currency for nothing and then lend it
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.000]  to the people in order to collect you know and then collect interest on it and
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.560]  force us to pay taxes to do so it's just a it's an upside upside-down system it
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:32.560]  gives power to the elite and it shouldn't happen this way and obviously they
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:36.480]  become so cocky that they think that that now they can now they can control
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:41.440]  populations and I mean it's just crazy what these people have come up with and
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:46.240]  what they have in store for us Alex say it's just amazing that the United
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:49.600]  States people just don't pick up arms and just try to take over this country
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:54.880]  thank God we have an election and hopefully we can continue to push more
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:58.400]  towards freedom and liberty but you know that's one of the things I mean that
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:04.080]  that that document I keep talking about that CBO document has a chart second
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:09.760]  page in that just shows right in 1913 how drastic of a change there was
[02:28:09.760 --> 02:28:14.040]  economically here in the United States just looking at that that percentage of
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:19.240]  debt as it compares to gross domestic product 1913 is the year that things
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:23.760]  changed we went right into World War one right into the depression and think of
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:27.200]  what they've gotten away with these bankers have robbed tens of trillions
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.720]  they're taking over our society they've beefed up the federal government to try
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:33.560]  to suppress the states and the individual citizens they've launched all
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:37.440]  these wars and our name that we pay for and that we die for in their own interest
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:43.280]  they've been able to do all all of this and they just continue to get away with
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:47.480]  it and now they want a world government where we pay them carbon taxes and they
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:51.640]  been trying to suppress gold and silver but now it's breaking out folks that
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:56.000]  go ahead why would anybody want to stay in the right mind in this paper system
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.320]  I mean if you have your money in annuity is you're invested in commercial real
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:03.160]  estate or the stock market if you have your money in the bank you're relying
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:06.720]  on the bank being able to collect interest on the debt and be able to pay
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:12.640]  off that 10 I mean FDIC right now is short by about 15 and a half billion
[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:19.640]  dollars in order to just cover the 863 or 823 banks that are on the list to
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:23.960]  fail right now I mean it's just this this colossal ten we're almost out of
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:29.920]  time and people need to take advantage of silver literally at spotter below and

[02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:33.520]  article first before we go to him this is from the nation magazine blackwaters
[02:33:33.520 --> 02:33:37.920]  of black ops over the past several years entities closely linked to the
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:41.000]  private security firm blackwater provided intelligence training and
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.920]  security services to us and foreign governments as well as several
[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:47.320]  multinational corporations including Monsanto Chevron the Walt Disney
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:51.400]  Corporation Royal Caribbean cruise lines and the banking giants Deutsche Bank and
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:55.000]  Barclays according to documents obtained by the nation blackwaters work
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.920]  corporations and government agencies are concentrated using two companies on by
[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:02.560]  blackwater owner and founder Eric Prince total intelligence solutions and
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:06.240]  terrorism research center Prince is listed as the chairman of both companies
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:10.440]  international company documents which show how the web of companies functions
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:14.680]  as a highly coordinated operation officials from total intelligence TRC
[02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:19.080]  and blackwater which now calls itself xe services did not respond to numerous
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:25.320]  requests for comment for this article now we know that they've used blackwater
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:29.360]  in man hunts in the US we know blackwater was then blackwater worldwide
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:37.000]  moved overseas and we know that MI6 commandos with special air services
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:42.080]  were caught in 2006 this is London Guardian BBC with fake beards dressed up
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.240]  like Wahhabist running around shooting and trying to kill Iraqi police in
[02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:50.600]  Basra to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other and you know the
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:54.000]  government stage the Gulf of Tonkin for operation Ajax they had the plan of
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:57.640]  operation Northwoods we know in army manuals that wiki leaks have put out
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:00.680]  that they had met are real they train army captains who were in counter
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:04.760]  terrorism how to stage terror attacks false flag I mean this is this is on
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:11.600]  record now I respect Wayne Madsen who worked for the NSA and enable
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:16.640]  intelligence and has written for some of the biggest publications in the country
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:21.600]  worked for the national enable data automation command national security
[02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:28.680]  RCA and of course electronic privacy information center he's written for
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:33.560]  again Washington Post you name it and so I take what he says really serious and
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:36.840]  I've never seen anything he's covered not turned out to be true but he says
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:40.440]  he's got a source of course as a journalist can't tell you who who's
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:46.120]  witnessed this stuff and in that they're threatened to prosecute him if he
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:50.280]  doesn't get basically shut up and here's the article at Wayne Madsen report
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:55.960]  calm blackwater XC cells conducting false flag terror attacks in Pakistan and
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:01.880]  so I tell you this is one of your most bold reports ever Wayne and we and we
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:05.840]  know two years ago they denied blackwater or XC was in Pakistan they
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:09.800]  denied US troops were there they now admit they are there general Hamed
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:12.320]  ghoul former head of Pakistani intelligence has been on the show
[02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:16.480]  saying he believes private contractors he didn't say blackwater but he said he
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:20.240]  said quite a few of these groups are there stirring things up because you
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:23.400]  got a multi trillion dollar defense budget every year they're gonna need a
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:27.720]  few billion in staged events but I don't know of XC's involved in this you
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:33.680]  say you do and so please break down what's going on here this is big well
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:39.480]  what I found out was I've reported that blackwater cells had been operating in
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:45.880]  Pakistan previous what what what was surprising about this latest
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:51.840]  information was that blackwater cells are behind some of the terrorist
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:57.200]  bombings in Pakistan especially those that have been directed against
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:03.520]  Pakistan's Shia minority and there have been a few of those just one not long
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:11.800]  ago that killed several people in an annual Shia religious ceremony so the
[02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:17.600]  idea that blackwater is engaged in false flag terrorist attacks are then
[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:24.200]  blamed on the Taliban I think raises the ante in Pakistan and as I reported
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:30.320]  previously to this report the whole idea is to be stabilized Pakistan to give
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:35.840]  the United States India and Israel an opportunity to go in and seize
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:41.240]  Pakistan's nuclear weapons now let's go through your report you say you've got
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:46.400]  an eyewitness source on this and you're saying it's meant to get Shiites and
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:50.640]  Sunnis killing each other we know in confirmed previous cases with special
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:55.680]  hour services of the British military that that's what they were doing so this
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:00.840]  fits that overall MO but this is very bold if XE I mean if your source is
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:06.960]  correct and XC is doing this yes and not only not only are they doing it but
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:12.320]  the source who was in Pakistan and witnessed this is now receiving all
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:17.080]  kinds of threats from the CIA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:24.000]  if this information goes public that the source and the sources family could be
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:29.440]  put in some sort of jeopardy with the law enforcement community so here we
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:34.800]  have American citizens being pressured not to talk and I think this goes with
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:40.400]  the whole Obama administration program of trying to curtail leaks censor the
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:49.960]  news and in this case direct threats on people is something that I know we had
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:54.400]  cases of it during the Bush administration but it seems to be now
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.100]  institutionalized as a practice by the Obama administration well let's be as
[02:38:58.100 --> 02:39:03.040]  specific as you can I mean if why protect the source or why does the source
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:06.720]  not want their name out if the establishment knows who they are and is
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:09.200]  threatening them I would think they'd want to go public so can you tell us
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:14.280]  why you're not releasing her name or why they don't want that a and b are they
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:18.160]  army did they work for XC were they another contractor group I mean I mean
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:24.160]  give us the specifics well the source but basically he was an investigator I
[02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:28.840]  wouldn't say a full-scale journalist but definitely someone who was
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:34.120]  investigating what was going on in Pakistan and and and and that the
[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:39.360]  issue is is that the threats have been made against the source and the
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:46.440]  source of family so it has to do with the immigration status because of the
[02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:52.240]  nature of the person's immigration system they were using as an interpreter
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:55.720]  or something yeah these are not these are these are not people born in the
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:59.480]  United States is a naturalized US citizen and have you met face-to-face
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:04.320]  with this person I have because I know every time I'm watching C-span they're
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:08.480]  having a national security hearing I can see you there in the gallery and I'm I
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:13.280]  know you you know frequent the press club I mean because if the system knows
[02:40:13.280 --> 02:40:16.840]  who they are I mean I guess they're not going public because they've been
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:21.080]  threatened hey we're gonna deport you if you talk about this but I I'd think
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:24.800]  they're in great danger just like I told the DC Madame this and many others
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:29.040]  that have been killed if they don't go public right and that may happen
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:34.240]  eventually but at the present time of course the the FBI and the CIA are on
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:38.360]  their you know in their threatening mode and and of course you met with the DC
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:44.360]  Madame right before they killed her I did I did because I think that if I meet
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:51.800]  somebody not a good thing for them but but definitely this is a government
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:57.440]  I mean we say Obama Bush I mean there's no change between the Bush
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:01.520]  administration you bomb administration when it comes to this type of harassment
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:07.000]  of individuals witness things over so from your source as much as you can tell
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:12.200]  us that a lot's in the report but as much as you can tell us I mean I mean is
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:17.160]  XC arming one group and then they're attacking others or I mean specifically
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:23.440]  what did they say there's that they've witnessed XC do basically XC be being
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:29.520]  responsible terrorist attacks inside Pakistan that are then blamed in all
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:33.440]  the you know the press releases and information coming out of the US
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:39.160]  government being blamed on the Pakistani Taliban and we've had some cases
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:44.680]  where the Pakistani Taliban has not claimed responsibility but it's also
[02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:49.360]  there's also a distinct possibility that people are claiming responsibility in
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:55.040]  the name of the package any Taliban after these US mercenaries conduct these
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:58.680]  terrorist operations to make it look like the Pakistani Taliban is coming out
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:02.600]  saying we're not doing this and absolutely in some cases that that's
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:09.040]  exactly right I mean that they're trying of course to gain popularity within
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:14.120]  Pakistan and now there's reports coming out that the Taliban Pakistani
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:19.040]  Taliban was providing aid to all these news and millions of flood victims when
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:23.560]  in fact the Pakistani government wasn't even responding to their needs so
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:28.400]  they're not interested I don't think and and killing people when when the
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:33.440]  Pakistani government by default did a lot of that did a lot of killing by not
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:37.240]  providing immediate assistance to the flood victims well it's the old divide
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:40.480]  and conquer get these different religious and sectarian groups stirred up
[02:42:40.480 --> 02:42:44.320]  killing each other I go back to that army manual that WikiLeaks released two
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:48.760]  years ago and the Pentagon admitted yeah that's classified manual and it says
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:53.160]  right there how to stage false flags to get the indigenous people on your side
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:58.400]  you go out and kill some of them and then blame it on your enemy and I mean
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:02.600]  weighing again for those that don't know has broken so many big stories is the
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:05.840]  real deal that's why I give this credibility but I have no way of
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:10.160]  proving this I mean how did you vet this source I mean I mean how do we know
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:16.960]  this is true well I met the source and the source is the interlocutor
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:23.680]  personally and after hearing the story I mean and it was a news to me because I
[02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:28.800]  had heard about Blackwater Z doing this in the past from additional sources who
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:33.400]  were inside Pakistan and also inside Afghanistan this was just another source
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:36.600]  are you worried about Prince coming after you
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:44.320]  Prince? No I think he's afraid of people in this country he's hightailed it over to Abu Dhabi with his family I guess he
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:48.960]  figures he's gonna start making money over there under the protection of the
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:54.080]  United Arab Emirates so the man claims he's an ABC only very patriotic so
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:44:00.240]  patriotic he flees the United States for an Arab shaked them. Well I'm not
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:03.820]  talking I mean I mean we know who these people are though and we know it's
[02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:07.600]  come out and been reported that and of course they denied this previously that
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:12.080]  they were in Pakistan they denied that they were part of CIA hit teams but
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:16.200]  hasn't that now been coming out even in mainstream news? Oh absolutely we've
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:22.640]  got you know we've got the Senate Armed Services Committee now issuing part of
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:29.120]  a report showing how Blackwater Z used all these shell companies to get all
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:32.200]  these federal contracts. Yeah that's in the nation I mean they're involved with
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:36.400]  Monsanto does that mean domestically when Monsanto trespasses to test your
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:42.520]  plants who knows it may be XC former CIA spokes. I mean I think this is a problem
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:47.120]  nationwide we have another report today out of Pennsylvania that Governor
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:52.360]  Rindell the Homeland Security Chief hired a an Israeli company to spy on
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:56.720]  peaceful protesters who were protesting everything you know they were protesting
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:00.960]  for gay rights they were protesting against. In fact let me stop you you call
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:04.480]  Curtin M. Owen here because he reported on this yesterday and the
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:07.960]  governor's had to apologize but I didn't know it was an Israeli company I
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:11.840]  know they're training most our Homeland Security that's even worse a foreign I
[02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:15.400]  mean you know the ADL's basically the same thing I said this was a look like a
[02:45:15.400 --> 02:45:20.320]  local ADL group they paid 125 thou to create these reports but yeah tea parties
[02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:25.200]  gay rights activists everybody being listed as terrorist and you're saying
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:33.200]  Wayne it's an Israeli company. It's absolutely an Israeli company it's out of a post office box
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:39.360]  in Philadelphia and another post office box in Jerusalem but I would note that
[02:45:39.360 --> 02:45:45.680]  the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and Huffington Post other media outlets have
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:50.900]  ignored the Israeli connection. Oh no it's the Pittsburgh Post Gazette that
[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:55.640]  within and they have this beat writer who basically is a shill for the ADL
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:59.520]  Southern Poverty Law Center within two hours of Poplowski killing those cops
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:04.280]  they came out and said he did it for Alex Jones I forced retractions but that
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:08.240]  shows that within two hours of these cops being dead they tried to frame me
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:12.400]  for causing it when it turned out he was a white supremacist who hated me I mean
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:21.080]  I mean that is really scary. Well in the name of this house it is called the Institute of Terrorist and Research in Response and as I say it was
[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:29.360]  it was it has a headquarters listed in Jerusalem and in an office with a post
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:35.480]  office box is listed. Well I've got Curtin here right now and we're
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:38.840]  just learning of this see that ties into the Pittsburgh Post Gazette and that
[02:46:38.840 --> 02:46:43.640]  writer that mainly writes ADL Southern Poverty Law Center pieces that tried to
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:47.960]  basically frame me for those you know for causing those cops Madsen's naming
[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:51.400]  how it's an Israeli company and saying the media is covering it up you're
[02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:54.680]  talking about Poplowski right well I'm talking about how going back I bet it's
[02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:58.480]  the never mind Curt just go I don't know why I called you in here the point is I
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:02.160]  just want to get on this Israeli thing immediately alright thanks a lot in
[02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:05.760]  fact maybe you should call Madsen right when the show ends and just get it
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:09.280]  directly from him because he's doing the research on it. Now Madsen when you leave
[02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:14.640]  us can Curtin Emma call you for 10 minutes and get. Oh absolutely and you can go on
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:20.880]  it's now being reported in certain media outlets that it the Israeli
[02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:25.240]  connection to this company that Rendell hired. No the other thing is Rendell
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:29.560]  saying he didn't know anything about it. Rendell is one of the most corrupt
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:34.320]  governors Pennsylvania has ever had so the idea that he said he wasn't aware of
[02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:39.440]  this is sort of ridiculous at face value. Well I mean Homeland Security is
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:43.840]  riddled with private contractors like XC it's riddled I mean I've got all the
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.960]  news headlines where the Israeli Mossad is quote training state police the ADL is
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:52.360]  their admitted front that came out in criminal prosecutions in the 90s in
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:57.280]  San Francisco and so the Israelis are not just lobbying in our country they
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:01.040]  are actively if this is the case and I know it's been confirmed in the past
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:06.680]  demonizing the Tea Party. Right and the other thing I think it's interesting is
[02:48:06.680 --> 02:48:16.560]  people are protesting against the this natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania one
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:24.000]  of the companies involved with that is now has Tom Ridge Homeland Security
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:30.120]  Secretary as an advisor to us a lobbyist board so here you have people being
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:36.480]  spied on by an Israeli company and you've got none of them involved but
[02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:42.000]  potentially you've got Tom Ridge involved to you know a former in Pennsylvania.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:48.120]  Your phone is cutting out a lot there Wayne repeat what you were saying about
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:54.920]  the gas explosion. Well we not only had people who were protesting BP the BP
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:49:01.320]  oil spill but also people protesting the natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania and
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:07.160]  they were being spied on and one of the companies involved in that natural gas
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:12.160]  drilling in Pennsylvania is getting lobbying support from former Governor
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:17.080]  Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and we all know is also a former secretary for
[02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:20.800]  Homeland Security. And he admits in his book last year that they put out fake
[02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:25.280]  terror alerts which under the Patriot Act is an act of terrorism they admit
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:29.600]  they put out fake terror alerts for political gain to scare us. Right and I
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:34.280]  think what we're seeing here is just that the creation of this Homeland
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:39.160]  Security Conundrum is allowing companies like Blackwater and this
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:44.840]  Israeli company and Jerusalem and Philadelphia to just take advantage of
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:48.880]  all this money that was made available and the only people were suffering of
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:53.280]  course so the American taxpayers are not only being ripped off by you know with
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:58.240]  the taxes they pay for this nonsense but also and the price they paid for their
[02:49:58.240 --> 02:50:02.600]  profits. Well this is a total private contractor and foreign government takeover
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:06.960]  of every facet of our lives with huge private intelligence groups brainwashing
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:11.480]  our police and now it's come out they made a secret deal ten years ago to
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:15.720]  steal the death benefits of six million veterans and it's reported like it's no
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:19.880]  big deal. I mean this this government is just the most criminal group I could
[02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:28.320]  ever imagine. Well absolutely and I think we also have to look at the whole of this
[02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:32.920]  Blackwater operation. There were hearings after hearings on Blackwater that
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:40.120]  involved all these CIA folks, Buzzy Crongaard and his brother there at the
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:44.600]  State Department, Cookie Crongaard. None of these people ever went to prison and it
[02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:49.640]  was proven that there was not only nepotism but there was also sorts of
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:54.520]  financial fraud going on and letting these contracts. And now the XC contracts
[02:50:54.520 --> 02:50:59.080]  are getting bigger. Let's come back and recap this and get into a few other key
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:02.520]  areas. Wayne Matz is our guest.
[02:51:05.360 --> 02:51:10.840]  Afraid to answer it? Afraid to answer your door? Did you know that debt
[02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:14.840]  settlement bankruptcy and attorneys will cost you about ten times more than you
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:18.440]  would legally be required to pay creditors? These are not ways to help you
[02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:22.280]  get out of debt. They are expensive payment plans and if you're in debt
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:25.840]  already does it make sense to load yourself up with another payment plan?

[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:09.360]  people draw their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:13.520]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights. Not
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:17.800]  democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So
[02:52:17.800 --> 02:52:21.280]  they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:26.800]  education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:32.640]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the
[02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:36.080]  facts, we have the Constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:39.920]  Knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer

[02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:11.400]  Alright ladies and gentlemen we did a search term yesterday and it did become
[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:14.400]  number one. We weren't able to get a screenshot of it but I saw news outlets
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:20.720]  pointing out that the term Gates death panels did become the number one search
[02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:25.000]  term and I do this because hundreds of blogs and newspapers then when it becomes
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.640]  the number one search term for a few hours they link through, they read our
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:31.640]  stories, we reach new people and I hadn't done one of these in a week and a half
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:36.520]  until yesterday and we did it. I don't know if we'll be successful now. Today with
[02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:42.480]  a new search term here at the very end of this hour it's up to you please make
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:47.360]  this new one the number one search term and then we're going back to Wayne Madsen.

[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:55.280]  and it gets into the death panels, it gets into how they're saying they want to
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:59.160]  arrest people that don't believe in carbon taxes. It's really a detailed
[02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:04.680]  report about euthanasia. This is such an important article by Paul Joseph Watson
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:10.640]  that I contributed to and so we're going to search the term eco-fascist. Just ECO
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:15.880]  fascist and if you put that in right now in the Google news it's our stories the
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:20.720]  top story so this is really important please put it in your Google search
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:27.600]  right now eco-fascist and that will take you to eco-fascist call for tyranny to
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:32.080]  enforce draconian agenda. I'll cover this article in full tomorrow 11 a.m. we
[02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:36.320]  kick the live program off central time but today's search term I've never done
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:40.560]  it just right at the end briefly let's see if we can do it enter at this hour
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:45.200]  enter at next hour enter it this evening and send the story out to everyone you
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:49.320]  know and just enter it in Google over and over again eco-fascist two words
[02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:56.760]  ECO eco and fascist is the search term today please help us get this out to
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:01.880]  everyone it's a powerful detailed article so people can really understand
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:07.160]  that this is all about eugenics. Wayne Madsen Kurt's in there on he's gonna
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:09.800]  call you at the end of the show because we're gonna use you as a source but I
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:13.160]  have noticed some other news is reporting this is an Israeli company but
[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:16.920]  that's like the ADL and Southern Parvy Law Center are Israeli connected
[02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:22.320]  especially the ADL there to demonize political speech in the U.S. it's not
[02:56:22.320 --> 02:56:27.240]  enough that Israel lobbies the U.S. this is isn't this really espionage to I mean
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:31.360]  if this is confirmed to have Israeli companies in here demonizing the Tea
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:36.480]  Party. I'll tell you there's another aspect of this is being reported by the
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:41.960]  Philadelphia city paper that this is company that was buying on people in
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:49.040]  Pennsylvania was also offering trips to U.S. college students to go over to
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:53.840]  Israel to see how they conduct their security operations to universities
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:58.200]  mentioned by name or Philadelphia University in Arizona State University
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:03.400]  now that as far as I'm concerned with the shoddy aspect of this company looks
[02:57:03.400 --> 02:57:09.400]  like Mossad recruiting in plain sight and not one move by the United States
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:15.480]  government to curtail it on our college campuses well again I've never been an
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:20.400]  enemy or somebody that hates Israel but I don't like British Israeli Chinese you
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:25.120]  name it here infiltrating could you imagine if the Chinese were we're
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:29.760]  getting paid by Homeland Security and state governments to demonize mainline
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:34.640]  political anti-war Tea Party you name it and then the report says they're
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:37.640]  dangerous terrorist I mean can you imagine if the Chinese were doing that
[02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:41.840]  Wayne how big the human cry would be
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:16.040]  and up there I said look I mean if this were if there were clients arrested on
[02:58:16.040 --> 02:58:21.440]  9-11 I would say you know Italy might have had a connection you know it was
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:26.120]  five Israelis alike it rested on 9-11 well it's amazing Wayne we're gonna
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:29.080]  continue to dig into this we're gonna call you to pick your brain about this
[02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:33.000]  so Kirk can get a story out this evening you can enter it as one word or two
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:37.880]  words eco fascist with an s eco fascist let's make it number one and reach
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:41.000]  hundreds of thousands of people today God bless you all great job crew thank
[02:58:41.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  you I imagine
