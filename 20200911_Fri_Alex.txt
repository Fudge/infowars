[00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:14.997]  Nineteen years ago, the United States saw the biggest terror attack on our domestic soil in our history.
[00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:19.779]  And I was there covering it live as it unfolded.
[00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:33.224]  Dr. Steve Pchenik will join us on the specifics of 9-11 and some of the top generals he talked to that were fully aware of how the terror attacks were carried out by criminal elements inside our government working with radical Islam.
[00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:36.346]  That is coming up.
[00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:39.128]  The Hodge twins will also be joining us today.
[00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:43.710]  And I also intend to try to open the phones up.
[00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.492]  It is September 11th, Friday, September 11th, the year is 2020.
[00:00:46.492 --> 00:00:50.454]  We're 52 days out right now.
[00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:59.819]  And I have seen Trump very few times get a tear in his eye.
[00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.401]  But he certainly did that yesterday in Michigan.
[00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:12.785]  When the crowd was chanting that they love him because he needs that energy because he's under massive, massive attack and he also needs our prayers.
[00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:15.508]  Here's the president who had to fight back tears.
[00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:26.213]  Especially when you have a crowd like this, but they're like this.
[00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:28.153]  They have such spirit in this country.
[00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:29.573]  People love our country so much.
[00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:30.394]  I went to Texas.
[00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:32.194]  I went to Ohio, went to Florida.
[00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:34.194]  It's always, it's always like this.
[00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.875]  They love, they love our country.
[00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:38.796]  And we're not going to disappoint anybody.
[00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:41.516]  We're not disappointed.
[00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:44.737]  For years, you had a president who apologized for America.
[00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.215]  We love you!
[00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:56.437]  We love you!
[00:01:56.437 --> 00:01:57.799]  We love you!
[00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:58.740]  We love you!
[00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:17.232]  Absolute violence and carnage of Trump wins, but even more violence if he loses because the communist mob's going to try to take control of the Biden administration.
[00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:21.896]  And that's why Soros and the Deep State are putting Biden in, they hope, because he's weak.
[00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:23.118]  And I concur with that analysis.
[00:02:23.118 --> 00:02:25.580]  We'll be talking about that coming up next segment.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.324]  But the big thing we're going to break down right up front here today
[00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:44.278]  Is they've tried to brand the Chinese communist Wuhan virus as the European virus, as the Trump virus, as the American virus, and now they're claiming because Trump, most of the stuff in Woodward's book is a fraud, but Trump early on said, boy, it does look deadly.
[00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:46.138]  They were saying it killed 4% of people.
[00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:47.639]  We said it might actually be deadly.
[00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.800]  We didn't know.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.962]  Then things changed as we learned that they'd hyped it up and exaggerated it to a level of fraud.
[00:02:54.997 --> 00:03:01.865]  They're acting like now he's behind the virus and he killed 190,000 people, when again most of those died of something else.
[00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:07.272]  It's just incredible fraud, but they're running around saying it's the end of Trump, he's in deep trouble.
[00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:09.274]  Here's some of the sickening press conference yesterday.
[00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:11.436]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:17.191]  Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?
[00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:19.973]  That's a terrible question and the phraseology.
[00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:21.554]  I didn't lie.
[00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:25.937]  What I said is we have to be calm, we can't be panicked.
[00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:31.060]  I knew that the tapes were, these were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls.
[00:03:32.202 --> 00:03:42.193]  And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work, not caring about his work.
[00:03:42.193 --> 00:03:47.879]  But I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of, you know, calls.
[00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.560]  So we did that.
[00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.250]  I don't know if it's good or bad.
[00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.391]  I don't even know if the book is good or bad.
[00:03:52.391 --> 00:04:06.481]  But certainly if he thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it because he thinks that, you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to suffer medically because of some fact.
[00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:08.462]  And he didn't report it because he didn't think it was good.
[00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:09.523]  Look, here's what's really going on.
[00:04:09.523 --> 00:04:13.746]  They told us 4% were going to die, then 2%, then 1%.
[00:04:13.746 --> 00:04:15.727]  And the best numbers we've got vary, but it's .000.
[00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.652]  And then a few numbers after it, and some areas even lower.
[00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:27.715]  Like in Australia, less than 80 people have died of COVID-19 when you take out comorbidity.
[00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:29.236]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:31.958]  Less than 100 have died in the major island of Hawaii.
[00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:32.619]  They don't care.
[00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:34.961]  They just keep hyping the fear.
[00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:40.224]  And now the flu's coming that really kills people, and they're saying, oh, oh, we're going to lock down over that, too.
[00:04:40.224 --> 00:04:42.186]  It's never going to end, folks.
[00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:44.548]  The masks don't come off until you refuse to wear them.
[00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:50.587]  The answer is when they started beating up that woman, the Spanish police, the people started beating them up.
[00:04:50.587 --> 00:04:52.709]  That's the answer to communists.
[00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:53.770]  Don't submit to them.
[00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.151]  Stay with us.
[00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:07.808]  As of 54 days out, the globalist, child-molesting, devil-worshippers know they're in trouble and they know Trump's going to win in the landslides.
[00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:11.451]  They're saying they're going to contest the election and plunge the country into civil war.
[00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:16.455]  And they're throwing hack attacks at InfoWars, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down.
[00:05:16.455 --> 00:05:17.816]  It's incredible.
[00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:22.600]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at InfoWarshore.com is critical.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.941]  It's what keeps us in the game.
[00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.162]  We've only got a few months.
[00:05:25.882 --> 00:05:26.762]  A backup.
[00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:30.243]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down and that's not good.
[00:05:30.243 --> 00:05:36.225]  We need to have extra money in our coffers to be able to expand in this home stretch, not just contract.
[00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:40.686]  We're winning, but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[00:05:40.686 --> 00:05:42.086]  So I know you're going to step up.
[00:05:42.086 --> 00:05:47.608]  At InfoWarsTore.com, we've got free shipping on a bunch of our best-selling items, a bunch of new items that came back in stock.
[00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:53.630]  We've got privacy pockets so your phones don't track you, great supplements, books, films, t-shirts, and so much more.
[00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.110]  Get prepared and fund the InfoWar.
[00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:17.522]  I've got a baby's brain and an old man's heart Took eighteen years to get this far Don't always know what I'm talking about
[00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:32.456]  Yeah, they try to confuse our young 18-year-olds to serve evil, to join corruption, and to reject God and their families.
[00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:40.479]  A lot of 18-year-olds are adults, mentally, and they know how to refuse corruption.
[00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:42.340]  But what if you're three years old?
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.561]  You're being raped by a liberal devil worshiper.
[00:06:46.561 --> 00:06:53.164]  Well, then you have your innocence ruined for life, and statistically, you end up about half the time being a pedophile yourself.
[00:06:54.568 --> 00:07:01.852]  We got articles out today, mainstream news, men raping babies on video.
[00:07:01.852 --> 00:07:06.575]  It's the new liberal trendy thing to do and pass it around.
[00:07:06.575 --> 00:07:10.817]  And the media is defending it.
[00:07:10.817 --> 00:07:17.361]  Now, I wasn't going to cover this today because it was too disgusting until I was watching when I got up about 5 a.m.
[00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:22.764]  this morning, the Anna Lorraine host election countdown last night, and I didn't know that a major
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.701]  Movie star, actress, you name it.
[00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:27.823]  I've actually seen a few of her things.
[00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:30.464]  I'm a fan of her husband.
[00:07:30.464 --> 00:07:35.528]  Blake Lively came out and talked about how Hollywood is into raping newborn babies.
[00:07:35.528 --> 00:07:39.190]  Their favorite thing is when they still have the umbilical cord attached to them.
[00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.752]  Now that's the kind of stuff I'm aware of from what's come out.
[00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:48.156]  What's come out in police reports over the years, snuff films, things you don't really see in the news, but comes out in court.
[00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:56.499]  And she talks about the law enforcement she's talked to that witnesses these devil worshipers raping newborn babies.
[00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:00.982]  Because they have women that specially breed to have the babies.
[00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:05.246]  And then they rape them in a satanic ritual.
[00:08:05.246 --> 00:08:07.908]  And you know, I'm sorry to have to start the show like that for you.
[00:08:07.908 --> 00:08:11.050]  But you know, I was wrestling with whether I should cover this or not.
[00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.351]  I didn't watch her show last night.
[00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:12.772]  I usually do.
[00:08:17.932 --> 00:08:19.333]  I just thought I better tell people about it.
[00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:22.835]  So we'll cover that later in this hour.
[00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:28.137]  But the full breakdown by Deanna Lorraine is posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:28.137 --> 00:08:31.679]  Blake Lively gives emotional speech on child pornography.
[00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:35.841]  The systematic pedophile agenda is exposing itself in the world.
[00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:38.182]  That's the headline that Deanna Lorraine gave it.
[00:08:38.182 --> 00:08:39.003]  It's at BandOnVideo.
[00:08:40.262 --> 00:08:49.204]  So, this is all coming out, and without even intending to cover this today, I just, I sent him the video, but I probably wasn't going to cover it.
[00:08:49.204 --> 00:09:00.647]  I had two articles in my stack about raping babies, and videotaping it, and passing it around, and I thought, you know, I better cover it.
[00:09:00.647 --> 00:09:02.888]  That's without looking for this, it's just everywhere.
[00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:08.257]  Can you imagine the police that have to look at this stuff?
[00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:23.326]  I've talked to some of them and General Flynn's lawyer has talked to them and it is horrific to have to look at a bunch of people that look like Brian Stelter with big demon smiles on their faces doing these type of things.
[00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:25.827]  I'm not saying Brian Stelter does it, I'm just saying they look like Brian Stelter.
[00:09:28.479 --> 00:09:30.820]  God help us, just absolutely God help us.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.221]  The bottomless pit.
[00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:35.842]  It means there's no bottom to it.
[00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:38.504]  There's no level that they won't sink to.
[00:09:38.504 --> 00:09:39.944]  They like it.
[00:09:39.944 --> 00:09:46.887]  They enjoy it.
[00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:50.209]  And by the way, they don't just rape these babies.
[00:09:50.209 --> 00:09:53.150]  They torture the living hell out of them and kill them.
[00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.291]  So that's all coming up.
[00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.971]  And you know, we can't let this get us down.
[00:09:58.971 --> 00:10:07.977]  There's big articles out today that the already record suicides have now broken other records.
[00:10:07.977 --> 00:10:17.662]  And the number of people considering suicides broken records, and when you go look at who they are, they're military, they're police, they're Christians, they're hardworking.
[00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:24.407]  White men is the largest group who are giving up on society, but it's black men, brown men, it's everybody.
[00:10:24.407 --> 00:10:24.747]  It's men.
[00:10:25.643 --> 00:10:29.405]  And they kill themselves because they can't handle the immorality.
[00:10:29.405 --> 00:10:31.286]  You need to stand up for the children.
[00:10:31.286 --> 00:10:38.169]  You need to prosecute and go after the globalists.
[00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:45.292]  You want to politically and economically, and then when the time comes, if they keep pushing this physical stuff, physically, we make them pay!
[00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:46.553]  We don't pay!
[00:10:46.553 --> 00:10:50.715]  You don't kill yourself, you throw yourself at the enemy.
[00:10:53.422 --> 00:10:57.625]  But people with conscience are the ones killing themselves because they can't handle it.
[00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.668]  Don't kill yourself.
[00:11:00.668 --> 00:11:03.430]  That's a coward's way out, and I'm not blaming folks that do it.
[00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.511]  I'm just saying, don't.
[00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:11.036]  You fight corruption, you get involved going up against the enemy, you're not gonna be depressed anymore.
[00:11:11.036 --> 00:11:17.220]  You're gonna have that hunger that an attack dog has when it's going after the enemy.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.822]  Give in to that, God's spirit.
[00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:27.561]  Of vengeance, because vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord, but God has instruments of vengeance.
[00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:30.443]  So, stop caring what people think.
[00:11:30.443 --> 00:11:33.886]  Stop caring about the world saying you don't have status.
[00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:40.770]  Stop caring about how nice your car is or, you know, if your wife's broken up with you and your kid's got problems, just stay in the fight.
[00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.413]  Don't blow your head off, whether you're black or white, old or young.
[00:11:46.664 --> 00:12:01.348]  We'll talk about some of that, but what I'll do is, start of the next segment, is I'll get into the huge news of them pinning COVID-19 on the president and twisting something Bob Woodward said that, oh, Trump thought the virus was deadly back in February and March.
[00:12:01.348 --> 00:12:05.070]  Well, the news said it was killing 4% of people.
[00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.010]  That's ultra deadly.
[00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:13.752]  Turned out it was a fraction of a fraction of a fraction, and then Trump changed his view, properly so.
[00:12:13.752 --> 00:12:16.113]  I said, looks like it's overblown, but boy, you better get ready.
[00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:25.799]  With the scenes of End of the World, we were witnessing that we now know was a major put on in Communist China to shut down Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:27.581]  And Xi Jinping's basically admitted that now.
[00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:30.043]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:12:30.043 --> 00:12:31.745]  And just incredible developments.
[00:12:31.745 --> 00:12:36.410]  Democrats caught on tape saying nothing opens up until after the election.
[00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.671]  And it's still not going to open up.
[00:12:37.671 --> 00:12:41.455]  Once these cult leaders get a mask on your face, they never take them off.
[00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:49.082]  And Fauci says Americans need to hunker down for fall and winter and no, it's never gonna end.
[00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:54.427]  Oh, he's such a little lying piece of crap.
[00:12:54.427 --> 00:12:55.968]  And there's some other good news.
[00:12:55.968 --> 00:13:03.795]  Big tech companies reconsider relying on SPLC after hearing about scandals and terror attacks that they run.
[00:13:03.795 --> 00:13:07.499]  And they're billions of bucks offshore and how they're run by foreign intelligence agencies.
[00:13:10.308 --> 00:13:12.971]  SPLC is in Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:15.313]  They run all the moderation.
[00:13:15.313 --> 00:13:19.216]  Hundreds of thousands of people trained by them.
[00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:22.719]  That's all coming up in a lot of campaign trail news.
[00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:31.868]  And like I said, if you think ten-year-old girls twerking in front of men who then let them commit crimes because they're sexually attracted to them, it's so disgusting.
[00:13:33.564 --> 00:13:36.406]  If you think that's bad, they're distracting with this show, Cuties.
[00:13:36.406 --> 00:13:44.091]  They've got stuff on Netflix where, again, 10-year-old boys are having sex with full-grown men.
[00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:47.413]  Pedophilia just absolutely in your face.
[00:13:47.413 --> 00:13:54.017]  And they use something like Cuties that's bad, but it's like low-level compared to the hardcore stuff that's on there.
[00:13:54.017 --> 00:13:55.198]  That's how they distract.
[00:13:55.198 --> 00:13:58.200]  And then that ties into all the hardcore stuff.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.501]  And we also have the NFL.
[00:14:01.377 --> 00:14:08.120]  The Texans refused to even take the field during the Star Spangled Banner.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.862]  And the other team took their knees in all this crap for diversity because America's bad.
[00:14:12.862 --> 00:14:19.285]  Then Lululemon said capitalism in America's bad and guess where they make their stuff?
[00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:19.606]  China.
[00:14:24.045 --> 00:14:28.187]  It's like saying Stalin comes out against communism or something.
[00:14:28.187 --> 00:14:30.028]  It's ridiculous.
[00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:31.809]  These companies are so evil, so bad.
[00:14:31.809 --> 00:14:37.932]  And then we wonder why a bunch of followers, a bunch of NFL players are told by their corporate sponsors do that.
[00:14:37.932 --> 00:14:41.855]  So they do it for money, money, money, money, money, money.
[00:14:41.855 --> 00:14:43.756]  Well, then don't give the NFL your money.
[00:14:43.756 --> 00:14:45.356]  It's been fake forever.
[00:14:45.356 --> 00:14:47.898]  Oh, the games are real, but it's all empty.
[00:14:47.898 --> 00:14:49.899]  It's all a joke and it robs manhood.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.725]  Everybody thinks boxing is manhood, or the NFL is manhood, or baseball is manhood.
[00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:58.026]  No, that's a diversion.
[00:14:58.026 --> 00:14:59.227]  That's entertainment.
[00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:04.892]  Manhood is taking care of your children, working hard, loving God, standing up for what's right, having moral courage.
[00:15:04.892 --> 00:15:09.656]  And these people in sports are the worst of the worst of the worst.
[00:15:09.656 --> 00:15:11.417]  They don't have moral integrity.
[00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:12.438]  They don't have honor.
[00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:13.379]  They don't have strength.
[00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:19.083]  And they work for a system of true slave masters that run slave camps, Nike,
[00:15:20.123 --> 00:15:27.688]  is the biggest apparel maker in areas known to have Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist slave labor.
[00:15:27.688 --> 00:15:28.429]  So does Lululemon.
[00:15:30.077 --> 00:15:36.278]  But they tell you decolonize gender, white people are bad, while they let the chi-coms run the slave camps.
[00:15:36.278 --> 00:15:38.318]  This is an evil organization.
[00:15:38.318 --> 00:15:46.140]  They're all evil, because they're all financed by the big mega banks that are one mind, one satanic vision to destroy you and your family.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.101]  All these subgroups want the loans, so they all follow the orders.
[00:15:51.101 --> 00:15:53.481]  They're your enemy, period.
[00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:54.421]  Period.
[00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:55.042]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:55.782]  Stay with us.
[00:15:55.782 --> 00:15:57.402]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news of the day.
[00:15:58.365 --> 00:16:04.269]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening, and I point out that the globalists are a eugenics death cult because it's true.
[00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:06.050]  I don't say it to scare you.
[00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.592]  A lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:12.334]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[00:16:12.334 --> 00:16:20.080]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.023]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan.
[00:16:26.023 --> 00:16:28.165]  And more and more are being honest about it.
[00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:35.568]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[00:16:35.568 --> 00:16:38.430]  So we're at the point of the emergence now.
[00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.330]  And it's coming out in the open.
[00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:45.693]  And some people, under mass Stockholm Syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny.
[00:16:45.693 --> 00:16:47.654]  But others are going to fight.
[00:16:47.654 --> 00:16:52.616]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay.
[00:16:52.616 --> 00:16:53.136]  No.
[00:16:53.136 --> 00:16:56.137]  This thing is post-human exterminism.
[00:16:56.137 --> 00:16:56.978]  Research what that is.
[00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:05.085]  Ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and are so incredibly anti-human?
[00:17:05.085 --> 00:17:06.506]  Love to censor people.
[00:17:06.506 --> 00:17:10.168]  Love to hover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships.
[00:17:10.168 --> 00:17:11.468]  Well, it's very simple.
[00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:17.852]  The first computers ever created were created by Thomas Watson, the founder and owner of IBM, to carry out eugenics.
[00:17:17.852 --> 00:17:19.993]  And they helped run the death camps in Nazi Germany.
[00:17:19.993 --> 00:17:22.674]  That's what the tattoos were on the slaves' arms.
[00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:24.075]  It would decide who lived and who died.
[00:17:24.255 --> 00:17:30.598]  So from the beginning, it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets, and making humans obsolete.
[00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:35.780]  The same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein and fat in it to make your child's brain small.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:41.703]  The same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers, that lowers IQs about 20 points on average as well.
[00:17:41.703 --> 00:17:46.305]  These are hardcore eugenicists, survival of the fittest, social Darwinists.
[00:17:46.305 --> 00:17:47.325]  Grow up, world.
[00:17:47.325 --> 00:17:48.326]  Admit the truth.
[00:17:48.326 --> 00:17:48.566]  Quit being
[00:17:48.746 --> 00:17:51.167]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:18.578 --> 00:18:19.539]  52 days out.
[00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:20.801]  It is September 11th.
[00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:21.542]  The year is 2020.
[00:18:21.542 --> 00:18:25.548]  Thank you for joining us on this live, teleprompter-free Friday edition.
[00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.511]  So, the media is beating the drum.
[00:18:29.511 --> 00:18:30.792]  We knew they would do it.
[00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:33.354]  They were always going to blame the virus on Trump.
[00:18:33.354 --> 00:18:37.296]  The UN said months ago that the pandemic is over in China.
[00:18:37.296 --> 00:18:39.957]  The pandemic is over in Europe.
[00:18:39.957 --> 00:18:46.201]  It was never an epidemic, meaning enough numbers of people actually getting sick and dying.
[00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:50.224]  It was a pandemic, meaning a lot of people were testing positive.
[00:18:50.224 --> 00:18:51.744]  But they wanted to turn Europe
[00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:55.187]  And turn other areas back on.
[00:18:55.187 --> 00:18:58.830]  But they're never going to say that America can be turned back on.
[00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.832]  Even if Biden gets in, the plan is to lock us down.
[00:19:01.832 --> 00:19:05.055]  I'm going to show you some of those documents and some of those admissions.
[00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:07.857]  So it's all semantical manipulation.
[00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:10.759]  Just like I've gone out, Penn and Teller have done it.
[00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:12.660]  Many others have done it.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.382]  Mark Dice has done it.
[00:19:14.382 --> 00:19:22.008]  You go out to any group, university students, adults, and you say, the hydrogen monoxide is running off into the creeks and rivers.
[00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:24.495]  You know, it's a big problem.
[00:19:24.495 --> 00:19:25.957]  We'd like to ban it.
[00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:28.882]  Almost everyone signs a petition to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:19:28.882 --> 00:19:30.384]  It's water.
[00:19:31.459 --> 00:19:39.165]  They'll also sign a petition to ban salt when you use the technical name because to most people science sounds scary.
[00:19:39.165 --> 00:19:51.335]  That's why Fauci says trust the science because everything he's saying is a lie and it's not science and the UN and big media and big tech censor medical doctors saying you're not allowed to question the UN.
[00:19:51.335 --> 00:19:55.519]  The essence of the scientific method is being challenged.
[00:19:55.519 --> 00:19:57.080]  Your hypothesis.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.860]  Your postulates.
[00:19:58.601 --> 00:20:01.002]  But again, this is war on reality.
[00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:05.244]  So here's the president being asked about why he lied to the people.
[00:20:05.244 --> 00:20:06.904]  Here it is.
[00:20:06.904 --> 00:20:09.005]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:20:09.005 --> 00:20:13.467]  Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?
[00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:16.228]  That's a terrible question and the phraseology.
[00:20:16.228 --> 00:20:17.788]  I didn't lie.
[00:20:17.788 --> 00:20:19.389]  What I said is we have to be calm.
[00:20:19.389 --> 00:20:22.190]  We can't be panicked.
[00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:27.312]  I knew that the tapes were, these were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls.
[00:20:28.468 --> 00:20:32.609]  And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect.
[00:20:32.609 --> 00:20:34.189]  And it goes on from there.
[00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:37.170]  So we're talking six months ago.
[00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.571]  They're saying two to four percent are going to die.
[00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:42.371]  And Trump's like, yeah, it looks like it's nasty stuff.
[00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:44.572]  But then he came out and said, be calm, everything will be fine.
[00:20:44.572 --> 00:20:45.372]  We got therapeutics.
[00:20:45.372 --> 00:20:48.073]  Turned out it was totally exaggerated.
[00:20:48.073 --> 00:20:50.913]  A scam, a fraud, a con job, not a hoax.
[00:20:50.913 --> 00:20:52.014]  The virus is real.
[00:20:52.014 --> 00:20:53.134]  It can kill people.
[00:20:53.134 --> 00:20:55.835]  Any virus can kill you if you don't have the right vitamins and nutrients.
[00:20:55.835 --> 00:20:57.035]  That's why they're called essential.
[00:20:58.254 --> 00:20:59.654]  You don't have vitamin C?
[00:20:59.654 --> 00:21:09.676]  You can put somebody in a pod with no bacteria or viruses and they'll die usually within three months with no vitamin C. It's essential.
[00:21:09.676 --> 00:21:11.376]  Same thing with D. I know I keep harping.
[00:21:11.376 --> 00:21:12.596]  I know you know that.
[00:21:12.596 --> 00:21:13.677]  The fall and winter is coming.
[00:21:13.677 --> 00:21:20.458]  They're going to have real deaths for people locked inside, getting no vitamin D3 from the sun and not having C and zinc.
[00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:22.158]  So you want to beat these murderers?
[00:21:22.158 --> 00:21:25.499]  Tell everyone you know zinc, C and D3.
[00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:28.970]  Like your life depends on it.
[00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.171]  We're going to get around to some fact sheets we're going to get up this weekend.
[00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:33.432]  I'm a little bit behind on it.
[00:21:33.432 --> 00:21:35.672]  With medical doctor quotes and factoids.
[00:21:35.672 --> 00:21:38.393]  So you can print them off at InfoWars and share them with people.
[00:21:38.393 --> 00:21:40.714]  Just have like a one page with stuff on each side.
[00:21:40.714 --> 00:21:41.934]  Hand those out there.
[00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:42.675]  Put them on doors.
[00:21:42.675 --> 00:21:43.755]  Put them on cars.
[00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:46.756]  You do that, it'll save hundreds of thousands of lives.
[00:21:46.756 --> 00:21:51.818]  And these murderers won't have those deaths to then use to take all of our freedoms.
[00:21:51.818 --> 00:21:52.578]  So it's a win-win.
[00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:55.359]  But let's continue.
[00:21:55.359 --> 00:21:56.180]  Here's Fauci.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:02.942]  Dr. Fauci says Americans need to hunker down for fall and winter and that never shake hands again and this is never gonna end.
[00:22:02.942 --> 00:22:03.663]  Total fraud.
[00:22:03.663 --> 00:22:06.584]  But China, everybody else is over business.
[00:22:06.584 --> 00:22:12.846]  Meanwhile, LA Health Director says schools won't reopen until after election.
[00:22:12.846 --> 00:22:15.567]  James Woods tweeted out and said, man, look how unhealthy she looks.
[00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:18.548]  And Snopes said it was a fake photo, which it wasn't.
[00:22:18.548 --> 00:22:19.889]  It was from Getty Images.
[00:22:19.889 --> 00:22:22.330]  But Snopes is God and they said it was fake.
[00:22:23.305 --> 00:22:33.553]  No, that's what these health directors really look like, and folks have put together montages of them all over the world, looking like she could star in a zombie movie right now, no makeup needed.
[00:22:33.553 --> 00:22:38.616]  I mean, she looks like she just climbed out of a coffin.
[00:22:38.616 --> 00:22:45.201]  Absolutely incredible, and we're gonna get to more of that coming up, but let's continue.
[00:22:45.201 --> 00:22:48.844]  So Trump says he didn't lie about virus bombshell.
[00:22:50.555 --> 00:22:57.937]  Because he said, oh yeah, it looks really nasty six months ago when we were seeing images of the apocalypse in China.
[00:22:57.937 --> 00:22:59.077]  Deadly stuff.
[00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:01.898]  From his own words, bring focus back to virus.
[00:23:01.898 --> 00:23:04.139]  But now we know it isn't deadly.
[00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:06.799]  It's very, very rare to make somebody sick or kill somebody.
[00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:09.100]  Almost everybody is asymptomatic.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:16.242]  So, they think you're illogical and you don't know the difference of six, seven months ago versus what the President says now.
[00:23:16.242 --> 00:23:18.163]  They're like, look at people at his rallies!
[00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:19.383]  They're not wearing masks!
[00:23:20.145 --> 00:23:22.326]  But then it's okay, Black Lives Matter for them not to wear a mask.
[00:23:22.326 --> 00:23:25.266]  It's all fraud.
[00:23:25.266 --> 00:23:28.887]  But here's some of the original information on it.
[00:23:28.887 --> 00:23:31.288]  Coronavirus, now a pandemic.
[00:23:31.288 --> 00:23:33.388]  How does that differ from an epidemic or outbreak?
[00:23:33.388 --> 00:23:35.109]  That was months and months ago.
[00:23:35.109 --> 00:23:37.009]  That's Yahoo News.
[00:23:37.009 --> 00:23:40.070]  Well, an epidemic means you're getting sick and dying.
[00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:44.991]  Pandemic just means a lot of people have the virus, which again, most of it's false positives.
[00:23:44.991 --> 00:23:48.612]  Coronavirus clinically no longer exists in Italy, doctor says.
[00:23:48.612 --> 00:23:49.532]  That was back in June.
[00:23:51.377 --> 00:23:56.941]  COVID-19 will not soon lose status as epidemic under the CDC update.
[00:23:56.941 --> 00:24:01.724]  They changed it saying no one needs to be sick now to call it an epidemic.
[00:24:01.724 --> 00:24:06.247]  WHO no longer uses pandemic category, but COVID-19 is still an emergency.
[00:24:06.247 --> 00:24:10.870]  So the UN is not even calling it a global pandemic, meaning a lot of people have it.
[00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:18.635]  But in America, we still call it that because, again, it's only targeting us to keep us locked down.
[00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:20.216]  So that's how these scams work.
[00:24:21.294 --> 00:24:28.259]  Meanwhile, the CDC cloth mask used to stop COVID-19 will not stop wildfire smoke inhalation.
[00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:31.621]  Even though the virus is much smaller than the average smoke particulate.
[00:24:31.621 --> 00:24:32.522]  It's all fraud.
[00:24:32.522 --> 00:24:36.124]  The mask don't protect you, it's all pure crap.
[00:24:36.124 --> 00:24:42.969]  The medical masks are so the doctor doesn't breathe anything he has onto an open patient having surgery.
[00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:46.151]  And that's a good thing, so they don't cough or spit or sneeze onto you.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.643]  They've also got a visor to protect their eyes if they're sawing bone or whatever.
[00:24:51.643 --> 00:24:56.768]  But the idea of walking around with gloves is just as dirty as your hands and wearing these stupid masks.
[00:24:56.768 --> 00:25:01.412]  It's all placebo.
[00:25:01.412 --> 00:25:02.213]  But here she is.
[00:25:02.213 --> 00:25:03.274]  We got the audio.
[00:25:03.274 --> 00:25:03.594]  L.A.
[00:25:03.594 --> 00:25:10.180]  Public Health Director caught on tape saying schools will stay shut until after the election.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:10.881]  KTLA 600 has the audio.
[00:25:13.814 --> 00:25:16.995]  But again, all these photos show what she really looks like.
[00:25:16.995 --> 00:25:23.537]  She looks like she has 0% fat and has been in a concentration camp under Hitler.
[00:25:23.537 --> 00:25:32.299]  But I have the Associated Press attacking, saying it's doctored, she looks great, she looks super duper healthy.
[00:25:32.299 --> 00:25:35.360]  Photo edited to make LA County Health Director appear sick.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.161]  Really?
[00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:39.302]  Go watch video of her press conference a few days ago.
[00:25:39.302 --> 00:25:40.382]  She looks even worse!
[00:25:41.775 --> 00:25:44.616]  I've never seen someone walking around looks this bad.
[00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:51.998]  She looks like she's starving more than little African children that are in a huge drought and that die.
[00:25:51.998 --> 00:25:54.218]  Again, World War Z, no makeup needed.
[00:25:54.218 --> 00:25:57.519]  She can be a zombie right now.
[00:25:57.519 --> 00:26:04.481]  But oh, Snopes says, Snopes is God, Snopes says she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
[00:26:05.489 --> 00:26:06.349]  False claim!
[00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:07.129]  Photo of L.A.
[00:26:07.129 --> 00:26:11.530]  County Health Director Barbara Ferrer shows her looking unwell.
[00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:12.871]  No, just look at her!
[00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:15.191]  From a Getty's photo on InfoWars.
[00:26:15.191 --> 00:26:18.732]  Why, she looks great!
[00:26:18.732 --> 00:26:19.733]  Here's some more of these women.
[00:26:19.733 --> 00:26:23.033]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:26:23.033 --> 00:26:25.174]  Here's Dr. Beth Bell, CDC.
[00:26:25.174 --> 00:26:28.395]  Looks like she's like the same space alien or something.
[00:26:28.395 --> 00:26:31.375]  Look at this woman, Belgian Health Minister, Maggie de Block.
[00:26:31.375 --> 00:26:33.416]  Boy, did no job of the hut out of sister.
[00:26:34.537 --> 00:26:41.200]  Barbara Garcia, director of San Francisco Department of Public Health, looks like Nadler's sister.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.482]  San Francisco Public Health, all these guys look like demons.
[00:26:45.482 --> 00:26:48.464]  Why do they all look like they're dying?
[00:26:48.464 --> 00:26:53.426]  Because you reap what you sow, and those that live by medical tyranny die by medical tyranny.
[00:26:56.223 --> 00:27:03.231]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands.
[00:27:03.231 --> 00:27:07.516]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that, you'd think it was magic.
[00:27:07.516 --> 00:27:11.161]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[00:27:11.161 --> 00:27:14.765]  So, for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:23.929]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[00:27:23.929 --> 00:27:25.530]  They're following magnetic lines.
[00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.411]  They have magnetic cells in their brains.
[00:27:28.411 --> 00:27:30.992]  We now know scientifically what's going on, but there's even a lot more than that.
[00:27:30.992 --> 00:27:35.114]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[00:27:35.114 --> 00:27:37.155]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:44.538]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system, that's what's going on with this satanic transmission.
[00:27:45.159 --> 00:27:53.558]  It's working through people, and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it, because it is a consciousness manipulated through the space-time continuum.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.181]  I don't want to be right about this prediction.
[00:27:59.181 --> 00:28:01.841]  In fact, it's not a prediction.
[00:28:01.841 --> 00:28:11.084]  It is a forecast that we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure of productivity.
[00:28:11.084 --> 00:28:21.306]  It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure.
[00:28:22.006 --> 00:28:22.206]  I think?
[00:28:42.935 --> 00:28:48.623]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting storable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient.
[00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:51.367]  Because that's the name of their game, is to make us dependent on them.
[00:28:51.367 --> 00:28:52.528]  So get self-sufficient now.
[00:28:52.528 --> 00:28:53.670]  Infowars.com.
[00:28:55.109 --> 00:28:59.431]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:14.056]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great.
[00:29:14.056 --> 00:29:20.038]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, non-essential, that we're bad for the Earth, and we need to be phased out.
[00:29:20.038 --> 00:29:24.240]  So, they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:30.864]  Just being very passive, living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[00:29:30.864 --> 00:29:38.089]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote, animal kingdom, is that we control our environment.
[00:29:38.089 --> 00:29:40.190]  We build our own environments.
[00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.531]  We create our own systems.
[00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:48.055]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[00:29:48.055 --> 00:29:52.698]  But instead, we're acting like animals, letting the globalists play the part of humans, and us as cattle.
[00:29:52.698 --> 00:29:53.539]  And that's the trick.
[00:29:58.215 --> 00:30:00.831]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:32.117 --> 00:30:36.442]  Say not this, you brazen infuse.
[00:30:36.442 --> 00:30:39.325]  I taste when we kiss.
[00:30:39.325 --> 00:30:43.590]  Take my hand, come back to the land.
[00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:47.914]  Where everything's ours, for a few hours.
[00:30:47.914 --> 00:30:50.998]  Let me see you, stripped.
[00:30:50.998 --> 00:30:52.760]  Let me feel you.
[00:30:58.383 --> 00:31:04.428]  Oh, we're gonna get stripped.
[00:31:04.428 --> 00:31:09.813]  Let me see you without your television.
[00:31:09.813 --> 00:31:14.877]  Alright, let's get right into it.
[00:31:14.877 --> 00:31:17.259]  Without your television.
[00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:21.763]  Alright, my friends.
[00:31:21.763 --> 00:31:23.425]  Here is the final equation.
[00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:40.389]  There is an extremely predatory group of people that go out of their way and even destroy their own self-interest and their own children to dumb people down, mutate people, poison people, and turn us against each other, setting us up for an end-of-planet event.
[00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:53.176]  Now, the Bible says an off-world entity was marooned here by the Creator, and because we have free will, that entity is allowed to try to trick us and destroy ourselves.
[00:31:55.023 --> 00:31:57.565]  Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:31:57.565 --> 00:32:02.890]  He was cast out of heaven.
[00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:11.298]  And now all the mathematics and all the science show all these dimensions above, below, and around us in the multiverses.
[00:32:11.298 --> 00:32:19.606]  And I can tell you as I've been telling you for 20 plus years, none of the globalists, not the Rockefellers, not the Rothschilds, not Elon Musk, none of them,
[00:32:20.953 --> 00:32:28.135]  Believe that there's not other entities and a controller that they're rebelling against that they believe they're going to break free from.
[00:32:28.135 --> 00:32:39.378]  And you notice Elon Musk came out about six months after I was on Joe Rogan, three years ago on episode 911, and he basically repeated everything I said about the establishment and what they believe.
[00:32:39.378 --> 00:32:43.159]  This is what they believe.
[00:32:43.159 --> 00:32:49.421]  So when I tell you all of this, it's very, very important for you to not just think that I'm here making this up.
[00:32:50.765 --> 00:32:52.046]  Yes, it's fantastical.
[00:32:52.046 --> 00:32:53.646]  Yes, it's crazy.
[00:32:53.646 --> 00:32:59.809]  But until you pull back and look at it, it's not human.
[00:32:59.809 --> 00:33:05.911]  This is not being done for us.
[00:33:05.911 --> 00:33:14.955]  And so a lot of people go along with the system, thinking that having a bigger house, having more money, having a better car, that that's the final symbol of success.
[00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.150]  And it's not.
[00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:35.201]  You have to understand that we have this ancient species that we come from into the future and maintaining that species integrity is the most important thing because it is cultural, spiritual death to allow that chain to be broken.
[00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:43.927]  And it gets into the laws of nature and the fact that things come in threes and a lot of understanding that I've not read in books.
[00:33:45.163 --> 00:33:48.325]  But that I have come to know.
[00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:52.168]  And it's extremely important that people know this information.
[00:33:52.168 --> 00:33:54.690]  And it's why they want us off the air.
[00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.412]  But they metaphysically have to be very careful how they do it.
[00:33:57.412 --> 00:34:00.114]  They need to trick us into sabotaging ourselves.
[00:34:00.114 --> 00:34:02.355]  Or trick someone else into killing us.
[00:34:02.355 --> 00:34:08.019]  They themselves are blocked by God's rules from moving against us.
[00:34:08.019 --> 00:34:09.420]  And moving against you.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.843]  If you understand that spiritual dominion.
[00:34:13.956 --> 00:34:19.999]  That spiritual deed that you have over the enemy.
[00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:27.763]  So, everything the enemy does is to hurt us, and to make us depressed, and make us kill ourselves, and make us give up.
[00:34:27.763 --> 00:34:42.490]  But if you realize that that is all a put-on, and a rope-a-dope, and a scam, and just open the connection to God and the infinite, and just ask God to defend you,
[00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:49.784]  Then the gates of hell will not prevail against us.
[00:34:49.784 --> 00:34:52.705]  But you look at the people that serve Satan.
[00:34:52.705 --> 00:34:55.527]  Soros and the Clintons and all these other people.
[00:34:55.527 --> 00:35:00.689]  They know what they're doing and they've been put in power because they're weak.
[00:35:00.689 --> 00:35:02.010]  They're not elites.
[00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.670]  We call them elites.
[00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:04.831]  That's the name they have themselves.
[00:35:04.831 --> 00:35:07.312]  They're not.
[00:35:07.312 --> 00:35:10.374]  They are jokes.
[00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:11.094]  They are slaves.
[00:35:13.635 --> 00:35:29.800]  And the people that follow them, at a primitive level, believe that there's a social contract, even though they don't know what that is, that term, and they believe these are leaders that really care about them.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.301]  And it's up to us that are leaders.
[00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:44.448]  To understand that the people following Satan's plan are slaves, and they're trying to lead other people into slavery, and that we have a responsibility not to just sit there and complain about this, but to challenge the enemy.
[00:35:44.448 --> 00:35:49.833]  And to occupy and to conquer the land.
[00:35:49.833 --> 00:35:51.494]  Metaphysically.
[00:35:51.494 --> 00:35:55.217]  So I'm going to stop preaching and get back into all the news, because there's plenty of it today.
[00:35:55.217 --> 00:35:58.380]  And I want to get into the history of 9-11 and where all that's going and so much more.
[00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:10.172]  Think about the gaslighting, the brainwashing of Nadler saying no such thing as Antifa.
[00:36:10.172 --> 00:36:13.133]  Or that Antifa are peaceful.
[00:36:13.133 --> 00:36:19.435]  Or they're calling these guys that were trying to chase down and kill Rittenhouse victims and heroes who survived a massacre.
[00:36:19.435 --> 00:36:22.375]  I mean, that's all upside-down world.
[00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:25.116]  But look at Nadler!
[00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.937]  I mean, if you chose one out of 50,000 people
[00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:35.147]  To physically look like a cartoon character, the image of weakness, it's him.
[00:36:35.147 --> 00:36:47.038]  But it's because the spirit shines out through the genetics and manifests in that.
[00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:50.742]  That's the enemy's top general?
[00:36:50.742 --> 00:36:51.563]  That's a slave.
[00:36:57.145 --> 00:36:58.306]  And look at this woman.
[00:36:58.306 --> 00:36:58.907]  L.A.
[00:36:58.907 --> 00:37:02.991]  Public Health Director caught on tape saying schools will stay shut until after the election.
[00:37:02.991 --> 00:37:06.614]  Well, of course they will.
[00:37:06.614 --> 00:37:11.238]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of her saying that to KTLA.
[00:37:11.238 --> 00:37:11.779]  God, here it is.
[00:37:13.157 --> 00:37:20.882]  Now you can type in her name, Barbara Ferrer, F-E-R-R-E-R, and the photos are so horrific.
[00:37:20.882 --> 00:37:24.684]  I mean, she looks like my grandmother's dead body at 92.
[00:37:48.075 --> 00:37:54.321]  And Snope says she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
[00:37:54.321 --> 00:38:03.349]  Now, imagine that level of gaslighting that they say Getty's photos are fake.
[00:38:04.864 --> 00:38:08.928]  And all we're saying is, why do all these health directors... There's a real photo of her.
[00:38:08.928 --> 00:38:12.111]  That's a real photo of the LA Health Director, Barbara Farrer.
[00:38:12.111 --> 00:38:14.173]  And then that's what James Woods did.
[00:38:14.173 --> 00:38:17.356]  James Woods then morphs it... What a horrible person.
[00:38:17.356 --> 00:38:20.799]  No, no, the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that's a real video still.
[00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:22.981]  That James Woods put out.
[00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:23.842]  That's what she looks like!
[00:38:26.892 --> 00:38:31.074]  I mean, you wouldn't take advice from her about a car, about medicine.
[00:38:31.074 --> 00:38:32.354]  You wouldn't take advice from her.
[00:38:32.354 --> 00:38:34.115]  You'd say, damn lady, are you okay?
[00:38:34.115 --> 00:38:36.016]  Are you stage four terminal cancer?
[00:38:36.016 --> 00:38:46.160]  I mean, I've seen a lot of my dead family laying there when they're dead.
[00:38:47.188 --> 00:38:49.510]  And she looks worse than all of them.
[00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.411]  The very worst.
[00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:53.874]  She looks worse than all the dead bodies I've ever seen.
[00:38:53.874 --> 00:39:01.480]  And the reason I'm obsessing over this is, they're telling you, look at her, she's beautiful!
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:09.607]  And then people go around and they look at all the other health department photos of these people, and they almost all look like they came from some type of Hellraiser dimension.
[00:39:14.321 --> 00:39:18.842]  And it's because, folks, these are the types of garbage that want to force-inoculate you.
[00:39:18.842 --> 00:39:21.343]  These are the types of garbage that Soros puts in.
[00:39:21.343 --> 00:39:23.404]  He didn't just put in district attorneys all over the country.
[00:39:23.404 --> 00:39:25.484]  He put these people in.
[00:39:25.484 --> 00:39:26.685]  This is who Bill Gates puts in.
[00:39:26.685 --> 00:39:33.266]  And they're coming for you.
[00:39:33.266 --> 00:39:36.787]  Because they're already dead inside and they want you to die now.
[00:39:36.787 --> 00:39:38.528]  They want to stick it in you.
[00:39:38.528 --> 00:39:41.989]  They want to stick their metal proboscis into your body.
[00:39:43.567 --> 00:39:51.012]  Attack your DNA and turn off your 8th chromosome so you can join them.
[00:39:51.012 --> 00:39:54.775]  Join their God.
[00:39:54.775 --> 00:39:57.957]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[00:39:57.957 --> 00:40:08.944]  That's because it was completely scripted and we even know the names of the United Nations, Rockefeller Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates and John Hopkins documents.
[00:40:08.944 --> 00:40:11.526]  We have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie.
[00:40:12.585 --> 00:40:18.450]  And it's designed to freeze civilization and have a post-Renaissance...
[00:40:19.682 --> 00:40:27.829]  Stagnation or New Dark Age and a total consolidation of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:29.951]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable.
[00:40:29.951 --> 00:40:34.034]  As you can see, all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully.
[00:40:34.034 --> 00:40:36.536]  Every I dotted, every T crossed.
[00:40:36.536 --> 00:40:39.459]  A total societal vertical integration takeover.
[00:40:39.459 --> 00:40:41.280]  Medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.584]  The big tech heads, on average, have had their wealth cooked up 35% in the last eight months.
[00:40:45.584 --> 00:40:47.626]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[00:40:48.407 --> 00:40:51.916]  Everyone is being forced out of their system to post human robot day coverage.
[00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:52.939]  You're being made obsolete.
[00:40:55.023 --> 00:41:18.370]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:24.212]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[00:41:24.972 --> 00:41:27.273]  This is a power grab.
[00:41:27.273 --> 00:41:30.674]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[00:41:30.674 --> 00:41:34.036]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[00:41:34.036 --> 00:41:38.218]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S.
[00:41:38.218 --> 00:41:44.620]  for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans, is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.882]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know the world's waiting to them.
[00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:51.703]  It's a very simple equation.
[00:41:51.703 --> 00:41:52.283]  It's illegal.
[00:41:52.283 --> 00:41:53.124]  We must resist it.
[00:41:55.819 --> 00:42:02.305]  You've always had a pledge from me, and it's that I'll come to you with the truth, at least as good as my human temporal truth can get.
[00:42:02.305 --> 00:42:12.854]  Because as the Bible says, we all see through a rose-colored, darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive, so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[00:42:12.854 --> 00:42:15.917]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[00:42:15.917 --> 00:42:21.042]  So, when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's got.
[00:42:21.042 --> 00:42:22.183]  But I'll tell you it's all I got.
[00:42:23.766 --> 00:42:27.751]  This country and the world is under major satanic threat.
[00:42:27.751 --> 00:42:29.874]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:42:29.874 --> 00:42:31.015]  You can look out the window.
[00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:32.737]  You can look into your own family.
[00:42:32.737 --> 00:42:33.639]  You can turn on the news.
[00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:33.939]  You can see.
[00:42:35.367 --> 00:42:36.968]  But you've got this commitment.
[00:42:36.968 --> 00:42:38.990]  I do recognize the truth of God, and so do you.
[00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.631]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[00:42:40.631 --> 00:42:46.995]  And I want to keep InfoWars in the main position to fight, and it only happens when you support what you've been doing.
[00:42:46.995 --> 00:42:47.936]  So again, I thank you.
[00:42:47.936 --> 00:42:53.580]  But go to InfoWarsStore.com, buy the product, spread the word, because that's how we're going to win.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.041]  Again, I thank you all.
[00:42:55.041 --> 00:43:01.446]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[00:43:02.006 --> 00:43:07.451]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:25.705]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps to
[00:43:25.905 --> 00:43:26.686]  I don't think so.
[00:43:58.081 --> 00:44:11.826]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:11.826 --> 00:44:19.688]  On a warm summer's evening, on a train bound for nowhere, I met up with a gambler.
[00:44:19.688 --> 00:44:24.130]  We were both too tired to sleep, so we took turns of staring.
[00:44:25.052 --> 00:44:27.654]  We are back live, my friends.
[00:44:27.654 --> 00:44:32.897]  I am your host, Alex Jones, as old Kenny Rogers brings us in.
[00:44:32.897 --> 00:44:35.759]  Alright, I've only covered one stack of news.
[00:44:35.759 --> 00:44:38.501]  Not even cover all of that stack, but it's the biggest stack.
[00:44:54.608 --> 00:44:55.709]  Let me do this.
[00:44:55.709 --> 00:45:07.280]  Let me get into the pedophile stuff, even though I don't want to, and I know you don't want to hear this either, but we have to do it.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.744]  Because they want to slowly bring this out and desensitize us so that we just give in to it.
[00:45:11.744 --> 00:45:18.150]  Instead, we need to get enraged, angry, focused, and expose them and use the pain to save these children.
[00:45:19.326 --> 00:45:25.049]  Because believe me, I could study 10 hours a day and not know one-tenth of what's going on.
[00:45:25.049 --> 00:45:25.769]  It's so massive.
[00:45:25.769 --> 00:45:29.611]  I mean, it's just, it's the total satanic takeover.
[00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:31.031]  Of course they want our children.
[00:45:31.031 --> 00:45:32.392]  Of course they want our future.
[00:45:32.392 --> 00:45:36.914]  Of course that's what these demons want to target.
[00:45:36.914 --> 00:45:40.375]  And it's a satanic invasion.
[00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:41.476]  And I get it.
[00:45:41.476 --> 00:45:46.538]  It makes me want to run to a farm somewhere and try to buy 100 acres and just never leave it.
[00:45:46.538 --> 00:45:47.939]  They're going to come to your farm, folks.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:51.221]  You're not going to get away.
[00:45:51.221 --> 00:45:53.501]  Believe me, I know what you're thinking, because I'm thinking the exact same thing.
[00:45:53.501 --> 00:45:54.862]  I'm not judging you.
[00:45:54.862 --> 00:45:56.162]  You think I want to be on air?
[00:45:56.162 --> 00:45:57.823]  You think I want to sit around in Austin, Texas?
[00:45:57.823 --> 00:45:59.884]  You think I want to fight these people?
[00:45:59.884 --> 00:46:02.825]  I want to be away from them.
[00:46:02.825 --> 00:46:04.045]  But that's not how it works.
[00:46:04.045 --> 00:46:05.466]  You know, we're supposed to be like Christ.
[00:46:05.466 --> 00:46:08.987]  We're not comparing ourselves to Christ, but be Christ-like.
[00:46:08.987 --> 00:46:15.809]  You think Christ wanted to beam into the middle of all that and then be tortured and go through all that hell and take on all the sins and do something we couldn't even imagine?
[00:46:15.809 --> 00:46:17.350]  No, we have to be Christ-like.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:26.122]  And so, you know, I almost want to apologize getting into this on air, but it has to be done.
[00:46:26.122 --> 00:46:30.503]  And again, we have a lot of great TV affiliates pick us up and radio stations.
[00:46:30.503 --> 00:46:43.206]  And a couple years ago, they would call up the affiliate director, John Harmon, and Scott Bronson, and they'd say, hey, you really can't read that police report on air.
[00:46:44.164 --> 00:46:46.705]  That's not for even adult audiences.
[00:46:46.705 --> 00:46:53.088]  And I would instruct them to say, oh yeah, Mr. Jones agrees, but this is happening to children.
[00:46:53.088 --> 00:46:53.829]  And people kind of got it.
[00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:55.690]  They're like, yeah, I guess.
[00:46:55.690 --> 00:47:01.953]  I mean, we were, we show videos of drag queen pedophile time where men have glitter on their genitals.
[00:47:01.953 --> 00:47:07.455]  You know, the stations call up and they go, can you just not say penis?
[00:47:07.455 --> 00:47:08.456]  You think I want to say that?
[00:47:09.428 --> 00:47:17.871]  You think I want to look at a guy in Austin with huge genitals, with glitter on it, with little kids hugging him?
[00:47:17.871 --> 00:47:19.752]  It's pedophilia out in the open!
[00:47:19.752 --> 00:47:20.652]  I got children!
[00:47:20.652 --> 00:47:24.533]  You think I like that?
[00:47:24.533 --> 00:47:25.574]  I get it!
[00:47:25.574 --> 00:47:30.595]  It shouldn't be on air.
[00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:31.856]  I shouldn't air what I'm about to air.
[00:47:34.445 --> 00:47:36.307]  But I should, shouldn't I?
[00:47:36.307 --> 00:47:39.210]  Because if adults, they know what they're doing.
[00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:40.191]  The psychologists know.
[00:47:40.191 --> 00:47:43.454]  If adults, they can make us just give up and go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:48.620]  Then they got the feel, don't they?
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:48:03.744]  If they can run us off because we're scared to engage and face what they're doing, well how do you expect the cops to go in and get all the snuff film videos and watch them and then go track down who did it and then bring it forward and then deal with the powerful people behind the folks that are doing all this?
[00:48:03.744 --> 00:48:09.046]  How do you expect the cops to watch this stuff that's a hundred times worse than I'm about to show you?
[00:48:09.046 --> 00:48:12.107]  When the pedophiles and the perverts are on
[00:48:13.047 --> 00:48:19.210]  TV at city councils saying we're going to get your kids, we're grooming them.
[00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.832]  So I'm not up here lecturing our listeners or viewers or TV stations.
[00:48:22.832 --> 00:48:24.372]  I am torn by this as well.
[00:48:24.372 --> 00:48:35.498]  But I think we've all come to the consensus that we have to face this, no matter how horrible it is.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.262]  Don't just stick a gun in your head and get out of here and leave the children.
[00:48:40.262 --> 00:48:40.682]  No.
[00:48:40.682 --> 00:48:42.443]  Fight these monsters.
[00:48:42.443 --> 00:48:43.763]  Don't commit suicide.
[00:48:43.763 --> 00:48:44.604]  Don't give up.
[00:48:44.604 --> 00:48:48.445]  Don't let their evil demoralize you and make you give up.
[00:48:48.445 --> 00:48:50.786]  Use that and say, God, I need you.
[00:48:50.786 --> 00:48:51.787]  I'm not strong enough.
[00:48:51.787 --> 00:48:53.087]  And God will give you the power.
[00:48:53.087 --> 00:48:56.969]  Don't worry.
[00:48:56.969 --> 00:48:58.090]  But careful what you ask for.
[00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:02.652]  Because with great knowledge comes great sorrow.
[00:49:05.387 --> 00:49:15.412]  You know, I could play you like 10 clips of them saying they're going to groom our kids on TV and giggling about it.
[00:49:15.412 --> 00:49:18.833]  We're going to get to it here in just a moment.
[00:49:18.833 --> 00:49:23.195]  All the media saying, oh, the virtuous pedophiles are such good people.
[00:49:23.195 --> 00:49:24.616]  They just love children.
[00:49:24.616 --> 00:49:32.560]  And it comes out in national, international news that they place tens of thousands of children with pedophiles.
[00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.895]  Taken from good family homes?
[00:49:36.895 --> 00:49:43.847]  Because the German pedophile network run by the Socialist Party and by Merkel's National Democrat Party
[00:49:47.725 --> 00:49:52.469]  Said, the ultimate love is an adult having sex with a child.
[00:49:52.469 --> 00:49:55.991]  And we'll form a new family with adults having sex with children.
[00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:57.532]  What the hell?
[00:49:57.532 --> 00:49:59.354]  That's in Der Spiegel.
[00:49:59.354 --> 00:50:00.855]  That's in DW.com.
[00:50:00.855 --> 00:50:02.676]  That's on national TV.
[00:50:02.676 --> 00:50:05.859]  And it's just a story once or twice, and you never hear about it again.
[00:50:05.859 --> 00:50:08.801]  Industrial level, child protective services.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.841]  Feeding children to pedophiles.
[00:50:18.841 --> 00:50:22.183]  And that's just one big story.
[00:50:22.183 --> 00:50:24.744]  And I knew the tactics, you know, three, four months ago when that first broke.
[00:50:24.744 --> 00:50:30.988]  Talked about one psychiatrist in Berlin handing hundreds of children over to dozens of pedophiles.
[00:50:30.988 --> 00:50:32.469]  And I said, that's one guy.
[00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:32.969]  You watch.
[00:50:32.969 --> 00:50:35.691]  It's a nationwide, international network.
[00:50:35.691 --> 00:50:37.111]  It'll be tens of thousands.
[00:50:37.111 --> 00:50:44.756]  And it came out a week later, 30,000 children placed with rapists as young as three years of age.
[00:50:45.828 --> 00:50:46.568]  Excuse me.
[00:50:46.568 --> 00:50:49.150]  Two years of age.
[00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.110]  There it is.
[00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.272]  Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile probes.
[00:50:53.272 --> 00:50:55.293]  And then it got worse than that.
[00:50:55.293 --> 00:50:57.474]  So what I'm telling you is you can't hide.
[00:50:57.474 --> 00:50:58.835]  This is a religion.
[00:51:00.816 --> 00:51:10.522]  And remember, roughly half the children that get raped turn into pedophiles, or something that is close to it, or at least collaborators with it.
[00:51:10.522 --> 00:51:14.324]  So, again, vampires aren't real, but the spirit is real.
[00:51:14.324 --> 00:51:16.946]  How does a vampire make more vampires?
[00:51:16.946 --> 00:51:18.587]  It doesn't have babies.
[00:51:18.587 --> 00:51:22.349]  It infects someone with the spiritual evil.
[00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:27.993]  And that's how they're rising up, and they've built this huge army of pedophiles, and they want more!
[00:51:30.814 --> 00:51:33.396]  They want to destroy the family.
[00:51:33.396 --> 00:51:35.458]  They want to drug your children.
[00:51:35.458 --> 00:51:37.219]  They want to sterilize your boys.
[00:51:37.219 --> 00:51:39.962]  They want to destroy creation.
[00:51:39.962 --> 00:51:44.105]  Because they hate God's creation.
[00:51:44.105 --> 00:51:46.787]  I tell you what, I'll start the next hour and I'll play these clips and I'll get into it.
[00:51:46.787 --> 00:51:48.369]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:51:48.369 --> 00:51:49.470]  Just remember this separately.
[00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:52.640]  The supply chains are breaking down worldwide.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.182]  The third world is starving at double the rate they were.
[00:51:55.182 --> 00:51:58.404]  China's buying up all the commodities and refusing to ship them, which is fine.
[00:51:58.404 --> 00:51:59.624]  Theirs is so tainted.
[00:51:59.624 --> 00:52:01.746]  But major supply chains are breaking down.
[00:52:01.746 --> 00:52:02.986]  Food lines are starting.
[00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:04.747]  Food shortages are beginning.
[00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:07.529]  A lot of farms weren't able to produce or destroy what they had.
[00:52:07.529 --> 00:52:09.210]  Reserves are running out.
[00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:10.431]  And I believe
[00:52:11.721 --> 00:52:16.704]  That you will end up seeing major runs on food, if not late this year, early next year.
[00:52:16.704 --> 00:52:26.528]  But regardless of all the craziness in the world today, and all the destabilization you see, I think one of the smartest things for me to recommend to yourself, and everybody else, is high quality, affordable food.
[00:52:26.528 --> 00:52:29.310]  So we have the biggest affordable food company in the United States.
[00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:31.211]  They're only 13 years old.
[00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:35.693]  They became the biggest within five years because of quality and the lowest prices.
[00:52:35.693 --> 00:52:38.915]  Can you find stuff that's even more gourmet, that costs four or five times more?
[00:52:38.915 --> 00:52:39.475]  Absolutely.
[00:52:40.854 --> 00:52:41.996]  Literally four or five times more.
[00:52:41.996 --> 00:52:44.879]  This is like a third of what the grocery store cost.
[00:52:44.879 --> 00:52:46.121]  And it's really good.
[00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:47.182]  Some of it tastes amazing.
[00:52:47.182 --> 00:52:47.823]  It's really delicious.
[00:52:47.823 --> 00:52:48.824]  Some of it's okay.
[00:52:48.824 --> 00:52:49.845]  But it lasts 25 years.
[00:52:49.845 --> 00:52:50.867]  The packaging is amazing.
[00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:52.449]  It's what I've chosen for my family.
[00:52:52.449 --> 00:52:53.770]  The biggest bang for the buck.
[00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.272]  And I bought it for family as well.
[00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:55.713]  I have bought...
[00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:02.810]  More than 10 one-year supplies from the same group in the last 10 years.
[00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.731]  And when it gets like five years old, it's still perfectly good.
[00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:08.852]  I just give it to the homeless shelter, give it to family, and it's still all completely good.
[00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:15.355]  And I personally have a three-year food supply for my family right now in my attic and in my garage.
[00:53:15.355 --> 00:53:20.117]  And I'm probably going to go ahead and just buy more because it's a checkbox you've got to check off.
[00:53:20.117 --> 00:53:23.818]  But whether it's a month you get, three months, six months, they have specialty foods, all of it.
[00:53:25.154 --> 00:53:32.138]  I would get your orders in at InfoWarsTore.com right now, ladies and gentlemen, because there's only one to two week waits now.
[00:53:32.138 --> 00:53:33.939]  It's fresh packed right now.
[00:53:33.939 --> 00:53:35.760]  I mean, really, they're shipping in like four or five days on average.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.782]  They said, Alex, you stay one to two weeks.
[00:53:37.782 --> 00:53:40.924]  And you get it, and you got it, and it's got these great tote containers.
[00:53:42.176 --> 00:53:47.178]  That if you go to Walmart or someone's trying to buy plastic containers, they cost as much as this does with the food in it.
[00:53:47.178 --> 00:53:53.522]  With the markup, it's the same nice big latches and plastic tops and sealed and then great containers inside.
[00:53:53.522 --> 00:53:57.984]  And believe me, portability, mobility, packaging is very important.
[00:53:58.744 --> 00:54:07.514]  It's secondary to what's in it, but if it doesn't last, if it's not contained, and it's not something you just throw in the back of a pickup truck in a rainstorm, bury if you need to.
[00:54:07.514 --> 00:54:13.661]  Make sure it's not at the water table, because it could still seep in, but if it's above the water table, say, like there's a hill on your property, you can bury it up in that.
[00:54:15.221 --> 00:54:18.963]  It's it's it's or be on a barn, have a false floor, whatever.
[00:54:18.963 --> 00:54:22.604]  The point is, is that hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[00:54:22.604 --> 00:54:25.505]  I'll get your orders in now ahead of this election.
[00:54:25.505 --> 00:54:28.166]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:32.107]  We've got some great new products we've launched too at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:54:32.107 --> 00:54:41.731]  That's my dad's new company and it's got the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash and a bunch of other great products like Rocket Rest and others at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:54:45.143 --> 00:54:46.745]  It was a sleeper product.
[00:54:46.745 --> 00:54:51.931]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five bestsellers.
[00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:54.894]  I'm talking about the 8-pack Power Stack.
[00:54:54.894 --> 00:55:01.863]  13 different pills filled with super nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and more that you take in the morning in one pack and at night.
[00:55:01.863 --> 00:55:03.424]  It's available right now at $60.
[00:55:04.245 --> 00:55:10.095]  We're sent off for a limited time when you get it with Survival Shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[00:55:10.095 --> 00:55:12.659]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[00:55:12.659 --> 00:55:13.600]  Now here's the problem.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:19.089]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in APEC Power Stack because of the shutdown and the lockdown
[00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.749]  We're good to go.
[00:55:45.356 --> 00:55:59.022]  It sounds over the top when I go on air, and I explain that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population, except for a few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods.
[00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:01.402]  But that's really what they're now externalizing.
[00:56:01.402 --> 00:56:07.265]  They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago, and actually openly announcing it everywhere.
[00:56:07.725 --> 00:56:10.226]  They're going from beta to operational.
[00:56:10.226 --> 00:56:11.906]  And think about all these major corporations.
[00:56:11.906 --> 00:56:13.266]  They tell you humans are harmful.
[00:56:13.266 --> 00:56:14.947]  They tell you humans are a parasite.
[00:56:14.947 --> 00:56:16.707]  They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of.
[00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:21.788]  And then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[00:56:21.788 --> 00:56:25.489]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations.
[00:56:25.489 --> 00:56:32.911]  And everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[00:56:33.351 --> 00:56:40.495]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics that are absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19.
[00:56:40.495 --> 00:56:43.336]  This is all absolute information control.
[00:56:43.336 --> 00:56:47.638]  This is beyond 1984.
[00:56:47.638 --> 00:56:54.642]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:54.642 --> 00:57:00.685]  Let me tell you how it will be.
[00:57:04.873 --> 00:57:29.086]  Alright, I'm going to come back and get into this religion of the anti-human satanist next segment and then a lot more.
[00:57:29.086 --> 00:57:32.628]  But Greg Reese has done it again with another powerful report, Freedom vs.
[00:57:33.959 --> 00:57:35.580]  Tyranny 2020.
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.040]  It's in the Gregory section of Band.Video.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:44.643]  Band.Video is working well today because last time I checked, the Communist Chinese have not launched giant, you know, hack attacks.
[00:57:44.643 --> 00:57:47.264]  I guess they only went five days this time in the attack.
[00:57:47.264 --> 00:57:49.945]  So you can share that video now while you still can.
[00:57:49.945 --> 00:57:50.825]  So here is the report.
[00:58:09.966 --> 00:58:11.913]  We're scarier than ever.
[00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:21.512]  Kill the police!
[00:58:21.512 --> 00:58:23.393]  Death to America!
[00:58:23.393 --> 00:58:24.974]  That's not Iran!
[00:58:24.974 --> 00:58:25.634]  It's Wisconsin!
[00:58:25.634 --> 00:58:29.296]  It could have been a dozen other places in this country.
[00:58:29.296 --> 00:58:32.878]  The violence has been building unabated for three months now.
[00:58:32.878 --> 00:58:36.900]  By some accounts, 30 Americans have died so far in these riots.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:43.043]  Five days into the first Minneapolis riots in May, as the city burned live on camera before everyone.
[00:58:43.043 --> 00:58:46.805]  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley took to Twitter to support the rioters.
[00:58:51.218 --> 00:58:53.340]  Painful for many, Haley wrote.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.082]  In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.
[00:58:57.082 --> 00:59:01.665]  People have taken to the streets, and I support them.
[00:59:01.665 --> 00:59:07.910]  How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would?
[00:59:12.262 --> 00:59:16.764]  Tessa Memorial Day has reached its inevitable and bloody conclusion.
[00:59:16.764 --> 00:59:20.405]  Last night, three people were shot on the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[00:59:20.405 --> 00:59:21.905]  Two of them have died.
[00:59:21.905 --> 00:59:31.869]  There was a shot that was fired as Kyle was retreating, actually, from a mob that had become enraged that he was trying to put out fires that the arsonists had set.
[00:59:31.869 --> 00:59:33.209]  The mob became enraged.
[00:59:33.209 --> 00:59:35.410]  They started relentlessly hunting him.
[00:59:35.410 --> 00:59:38.071]  A shot was fired from behind him.
[00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:43.438]  Once Kyle was running away, legally, the guy chasing him is now the aggressor.
[00:59:43.438 --> 00:59:50.467]  The individual, Mr. Rosenbaum, who was leading the attack on him, set upon him, immediately began to assault him from behind.
[00:59:50.467 --> 00:59:56.575]  The 17-year-old has been officially charged with two counts of homicide and one count of attempted homicide.
[01:00:22.398 --> 01:00:25.461]  There's a lot of confusion about what exactly happened.
[01:00:25.461 --> 01:00:32.927]  But in at least two of the shooting's video shows, Riddick House, running away, being attacked, and then fired.
[01:00:32.927 --> 01:00:41.714]  At one point, the 17-year-old, who's now been charged, tried to run from the mob, he tripped and fell in the middle of the street.
[01:00:41.714 --> 01:00:46.038]  A man ran up and smashed him in the head with a skateboard.
[01:00:46.038 --> 01:00:47.619]  The 17-year-old then fired his gun.
[01:00:58.095 --> 01:01:00.097]  And now a mob chase Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:01:18.038 --> 01:01:19.399]  All of this months ago.
[01:01:19.399 --> 01:01:28.604]  If federal prosecutors had treated the organizers of BLM and Antifa the way they treated Roger Stone, our cities wouldn't look like Kosovo tonight.
[01:01:28.604 --> 01:01:38.050]  What you're watching is an effort by the academic left, funded by big business, to crush the last remaining resistance to their control of the country.
[01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:41.712]  And that resistance is an independent American middle class.
[01:01:41.712 --> 01:01:43.954]  That's who they really hate.
[01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:45.054]  This is not a race war.
[01:01:45.054 --> 01:01:46.015]  This is a class war.
[01:01:47.151 --> 01:01:48.492]  Absolutely.
[01:01:48.492 --> 01:01:49.432]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:01:49.432 --> 01:01:54.656]  Stay with us.
[01:01:54.656 --> 01:01:56.937]  I know I say it all the time, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[01:01:56.937 --> 01:02:06.263]  I want to thank you, the listeners and viewers of this broadcast and all the stations and all the affiliates and sponsors and my family and the crew and just everybody out there.
[01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:13.012]  The listeners and viewers have just said, this is such an epic struggle and we've all been proven dead on.
[01:02:13.012 --> 01:02:15.493]  We've been proven we're right because we're being led by God.
[01:02:15.493 --> 01:02:17.614]  We have a spirit and we're very humble about that.
[01:02:17.614 --> 01:02:18.534]  This is not us.
[01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:19.615]  This is God working through us.
[01:02:19.615 --> 01:02:23.176]  But man, now it's so precious to stay on air.
[01:02:23.176 --> 01:02:27.138]  I used to think, you know, maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of recede into the
[01:02:28.038 --> 01:02:51.258]  background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day is a little bit old but now with evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated I never questioned what I was saying because I knew it was true but I I did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out well now we know they're gonna carry it out and then some so we got a fight and I just really appreciate you and we're in this together and praise God past the ammunition the info war again take action folks this is it
[01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:05.295]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:03:05.295 --> 01:03:07.017]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.001]  But your thoughts will soon be wandering.
[01:03:40.148 --> 01:03:41.789]  We are back.
[01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:49.792]  I really appreciate you all tuning in on this live Friday edition.
[01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.592]  We're an incredible proud to be live.
[01:03:51.592 --> 01:03:54.173]  All of us together, conscious on this planet.
[01:03:54.173 --> 01:03:55.514]  It's beyond amazing.
[01:03:55.514 --> 01:04:00.756]  It's reality.
[01:04:00.756 --> 01:04:03.777]  On the road again.
[01:04:03.777 --> 01:04:06.698]  Here I am, up on the stage.
[01:04:06.698 --> 01:04:07.859]  Alright, let's get into it.
[01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:27.626]  So, Netflix has a whole bunch of pedophilic shows just like Vice does and HBO and the New York Times is saying it's a good thing and the German government just had a huge program with 30,000 children being handed over to convicted pedophiles that live with them to create the beautiful Nambla love.
[01:04:27.626 --> 01:04:32.691]  And so people are finding out about this and going, man, how could this be?
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:47.643]  So they distract off onto cuties, which is 10-11 year old girls sexually shaking their asses in front of full grown men and breaking into buildings and committing crimes and promoting communism and I mean it's a pedophilic program.
[01:04:47.643 --> 01:04:57.726]  But it's a distraction from the real shows they've got that are like, you know, men dressed as women having sex with 10 year old children, going, hey I'm going to go in there and have sex and it's real.
[01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:05.822]  Now on the IMDB, they say, hey, this show depicts things defined as pedophilia.
[01:05:05.822 --> 01:05:06.903]  They want you to know that.
[01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:14.784]  And then the head of it comes out and says, oh no, this fights the sexualization of children.
[01:05:14.784 --> 01:05:20.366]  Kind of like Nike and Lululemon having slave camps in China fights slave camps, right?
[01:05:20.366 --> 01:05:27.027]  Or Tim Cook gives money to Black Lives Matter while they have some of the worst slave camps in China.
[01:05:27.027 --> 01:05:29.288]  It's all just sick, evil virtue signaling.
[01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:32.971]  to distract you from what they're really doing.
[01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:34.132]  So, videos!
[01:05:34.132 --> 01:05:35.353]  I'm not going to show these.
[01:05:35.353 --> 01:05:39.816]  Child actors in Netflix cuties are even more sexualized than conservatives feared.
[01:05:39.816 --> 01:05:52.926]  Yeah, it's, it's very risque with, you know, I mean, I'm 46 and I would not choose to take my wife to something like this if adult women were doing this.
[01:05:52.926 --> 01:05:55.368]  I mean, if my wife's like, what are you doing taking me to a Vegas show?
[01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:55.768]  What's going on?
[01:05:55.768 --> 01:05:57.810]  What are you doing taking me to a topless bar?
[01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:58.450]  Some people want to do that.
[01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.011]  You're adults, do whatever you want.
[01:06:00.011 --> 01:06:00.872]  The point is, is that
[01:06:02.984 --> 01:06:05.265]  It usually causes a problem.
[01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:09.467]  This is children.
[01:06:09.467 --> 01:06:12.409]  And then here's just the stacks of news I have today without even looking.
[01:06:12.409 --> 01:06:15.991]  Oklahoma man wanted for sexually assaulting baby on video.
[01:06:15.991 --> 01:06:19.272]  Arrested in San Marcos, Texas, south of Austin.
[01:06:19.272 --> 01:06:20.213]  CBS News Austin.
[01:06:21.158 --> 01:06:38.387]  Bryce Gage Watkins was arrested by Lone Star Fugitive Task Force in San Marcos for reportedly sexually assaulting a six-month-old baby and raping the baby on video and putting it on social media and getting love and likes from all the liberals.
[01:06:38.387 --> 01:06:44.950]  Facebook allows reported baby rapists to keep account but they banned Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.071]  Oh yeah, this is the club.
[01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:56.805]  There's nothing cooler to these people than destroying innocents and hurting somebody that's innocent.
[01:06:56.805 --> 01:07:01.247]  Here it is, Netflix breaks silence on cuties after massive backlash over sexualization of children.
[01:07:01.247 --> 01:07:03.709]  The Fens movie is a powerful story.
[01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:09.393]  Cuties is a story and a social commentary against the sexualization of young children.
[01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:12.855]  Hitler was pro-Jewish.
[01:07:12.855 --> 01:07:14.937]  Stalin was pro-capitalist.
[01:07:14.937 --> 01:07:15.537]  That's what they're saying.
[01:07:18.957 --> 01:07:24.781]  And that's where these people are coming from.
[01:07:24.781 --> 01:07:25.442]  It's who they are.
[01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:26.663]  Of course, I'm being satirical.
[01:07:26.663 --> 01:07:31.306]  Hitler did not like Jews and Stalin did not like capitalism.
[01:07:31.306 --> 01:07:36.510]  Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of children.
[01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:38.492]  I watched as much as I could, five minutes of it.
[01:07:38.492 --> 01:07:45.957]  It was horrible, but it was the tip of the iceberg compared to what goes on with pedophile story time at your local school.
[01:07:45.957 --> 01:07:47.458]  But seeing an interviewed Netflix CEO,
[01:07:48.735 --> 01:07:51.617]  And Phil asked one question about Cuties or all the other shows.
[01:07:51.617 --> 01:07:55.759]  Meanwhile, Cutie promotes the Hammer and Sickle iconography.
[01:07:55.759 --> 01:07:57.820]  But that's okay.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:07.305]  Athletic apparel company Lululemon sponsors Decolonizing Gender, Resist Capitalism, Bring Down America workshops.
[01:08:07.305 --> 01:08:08.466]  Even though, you look it up,
[01:08:10.933 --> 01:08:18.836]  They make almost all their apparel and sweatshops and slave labor in Communist China and other hell holes.
[01:08:18.836 --> 01:08:22.797]  3% of its production is in North America.
[01:08:22.797 --> 01:08:32.140]  But it's okay because they got a mulatto lady on the front, so... Nice pretty woman, so everything's okay.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:40.303]  They don't... They're gonna unveil the historical badness of America, but not the current slave camps in China.
[01:08:42.273 --> 01:08:45.474]  See how that works?
[01:08:45.474 --> 01:08:54.097]  As long as you're fighting William Jefferson Davis from 160 years ago, you're fine.
[01:08:54.097 --> 01:09:01.300]  But you don't fight Guther Northam in his blackface or his KKK outfit when he keeps your baby comfortable.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:05.702]  And they take the organs and the blood and the skin.
[01:09:05.702 --> 01:09:08.063]  But then it's all liberal, so it's okay.
[01:09:08.063 --> 01:09:10.464]  So let's go ahead and roll part of this.
[01:09:10.464 --> 01:09:11.044]  This is, uh,
[01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:17.440]  An actress and she's married to the Deadpool guy who's actually a pretty good actor.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.825]  And I never paid any attention to Blake.
[01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.368]  Lively.
[01:09:25.368 --> 01:09:27.209]  But now I do because the actress
[01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:31.234]  An awards program got into what's really going on.
[01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:32.695]  It's hard to hear this.
[01:09:32.695 --> 01:09:34.675]  It's hard to see this, but this is what needs to come out.
[01:09:34.675 --> 01:09:36.416]  And this is what law enforcement told her.
[01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:37.757]  And I can tell you, this is what goes on.
[01:09:37.757 --> 01:09:43.059]  I just showed you CBS News, this happening in Austin and other places just today.
[01:09:43.059 --> 01:09:49.481]  Because the trendy thing to do is to rape a baby.
[01:09:49.481 --> 01:09:51.282]  Here is her breakdown of it.
[01:09:52.695 --> 01:09:56.696]  ...of boys and girls under the age of 18.
[01:09:56.696 --> 01:10:01.016]  But now, because of high-speed internet, it's also videos, very prominently.
[01:10:01.016 --> 01:10:06.497]  And videos of kids, and by kids I mean prepubescent, visibly prepubescent.
[01:10:06.497 --> 01:10:15.999]  And they make the distinction because of the internet and there's so much content, these pedophiles are desensitized.
[01:10:15.999 --> 01:10:21.360]  Because of that, the kids are getting younger, and the content is getting that much more devastating.
[01:10:22.699 --> 01:10:33.088]  So when this law enforcement officer told me this, I asked him how young are the young kids he's seeing, and he told me infants.
[01:10:33.088 --> 01:10:35.650]  And I have a six-month-old baby.
[01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:37.412]  So I said, what does that mean?
[01:10:37.412 --> 01:10:38.673]  What does an infant mean?
[01:10:38.673 --> 01:10:40.855]  And he said, with the umbilical cord still attached.
[01:10:42.452 --> 01:10:57.707]  I know it's so devastating to hear this and I'm really sorry to share this but I'm grateful that you guys are listening because this is actually happening and it's important that we know this and that it resonates with us so that we think about this in our days and in our personal life.
[01:10:58.548 --> 01:11:14.098]  Um, so I asked them what happens in these videos and, you know, unspeakable things happen, but I'm, again, going to speak about them because I feel like if these kids are experiencing this, the least that they deserve is for us to hear what is actually happening to them.
[01:11:15.258 --> 01:11:17.199]  So, no, it's not just touching.
[01:11:17.199 --> 01:11:20.039]  There is penetration.
[01:11:20.039 --> 01:11:23.060]  There is extreme torture and bondage.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:28.641]  There is bestiality, which is having an animal penetrate the child or infant.
[01:11:28.641 --> 01:11:29.741]  There is incest.
[01:11:29.741 --> 01:11:35.122]  I mean, they said you think of it, anything you can think of, it's out there and it's being traded.
[01:11:35.122 --> 01:11:40.003]  And it's 30 to 50 million files a day being traded that we know of.
[01:11:40.003 --> 01:11:41.984]  I mean, you can see what's happening right now.
[01:11:43.284 --> 01:11:46.526]  And this is happening to any child and every child.
[01:11:46.526 --> 01:11:50.028]  You know, 90% of children know they're abusers.
[01:11:50.028 --> 01:11:52.750]  So, you know, our children are at risk.
[01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:54.131]  You may know this person.
[01:11:54.131 --> 01:11:55.171]  It may be a doctor.
[01:11:55.171 --> 01:11:57.413]  It may be a coach.
[01:11:57.413 --> 01:12:04.897]  You know, I thought that people that were working with children were people that wanted to protect them.
[01:12:04.897 --> 01:12:12.122]  But oftentimes, it's people who have this propensity for wanting to lower children.
[01:12:13.311 --> 01:12:17.493]  And now they just have Netflix shows where they go, here, I'm leading a kid into a dirty mattress.
[01:12:17.493 --> 01:12:19.954]  He's 10, never met a 10-year-old top.
[01:12:19.954 --> 01:12:25.796]  That means that the 10-year-old boy is going to be having sex with the man dressed like a woman.
[01:12:25.796 --> 01:12:27.817]  And this is going on.
[01:12:27.817 --> 01:12:29.357]  This is celebrated.
[01:12:29.357 --> 01:12:32.678]  And that's why people in Hollywood that aren't part of it are speaking out against it.
[01:12:32.678 --> 01:12:34.339]  And so it's going on en masse.
[01:12:34.339 --> 01:12:39.341]  But their favorite thing is not just to rape babies.
[01:12:40.595 --> 01:12:42.821]  It's a black mass.
[01:12:42.821 --> 01:12:44.846]  They cut them up, they drink their blood.
[01:12:44.846 --> 01:12:46.349]  They kill them.
[01:12:46.349 --> 01:12:47.993]  So, that's who the Democrat Party are.
[01:12:47.993 --> 01:12:49.597]  Devil-worshipping, blood-drinking Satanists.
[01:12:49.597 --> 01:12:50.099]  Stay with us.
[01:12:51.874 --> 01:12:54.295]  I don't want to say I'm a prideful person.
[01:12:54.295 --> 01:12:55.635]  I am a humble person overall.
[01:12:55.635 --> 01:12:58.717]  I've not come off as aggressive in things because I'm under threat.
[01:12:58.717 --> 01:12:59.417]  You're under threat.
[01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:01.338]  And I'm fighting as hard as I possibly can.
[01:13:01.338 --> 01:13:03.458]  And I appreciate your support and your prayers.
[01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:05.839]  But I know I come off as obnoxious sometimes.
[01:13:05.839 --> 01:13:07.240]  And I wish I did a better job.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:12.162]  So that's why when you call in thanking me all the time, it just kind of makes me feel pathetic because
[01:13:12.982 --> 01:13:19.325]  I guess Call It Pride, I don't like begging you all the time to try our products, or to donate, or to spread the word, or to pray for us.
[01:13:19.325 --> 01:13:20.746]  I just know that's what keeps us on air.
[01:13:20.746 --> 01:13:22.807]  And so I want to thank you.
[01:13:22.807 --> 01:13:26.768]  It's put the cart before the horse to call it and thank me.
[01:13:26.768 --> 01:13:29.009]  Listen, I'm committed to this just like you are.
[01:13:29.009 --> 01:13:31.170]  So understand, you're my equal 110%.
[01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:33.511]  And I just want to thank you all.
[01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:36.773]  I want to thank our crew, our affiliates, everybody else, man.
[01:13:36.773 --> 01:13:37.953]  I just want to stay in this fight.
[01:13:37.953 --> 01:13:38.934]  And it's so serious now.
[01:13:39.674 --> 01:13:44.097]  Things are getting so clear now, that's why they want us off air, because all of our credibility is so high.
[01:13:44.097 --> 01:13:51.581]  Let's just stay together, fight hard, spread the word, pray to God, take us through this, we're going to make it.
[01:13:51.581 --> 01:13:58.344]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe, and it's free will.
[01:13:58.344 --> 01:14:02.107]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists,
[01:14:03.103 --> 01:14:13.372]  The anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing and openly tell you that you're worthless and crap and you need to die because that will save the earth.
[01:14:13.372 --> 01:14:21.299]  They do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[01:14:21.299 --> 01:14:22.941]  They are making you hate yourself.
[01:14:22.941 --> 01:14:24.342]  They are making you be depressed.
[01:14:24.822 --> 01:14:30.046]  They're making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future.
[01:14:30.046 --> 01:14:31.707]  And that's what all this is about, you know.
[01:14:31.707 --> 01:14:35.891]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[01:14:35.891 --> 01:14:42.155]  Well, they're the ones running around like mad scientists, endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies.
[01:14:42.155 --> 01:14:45.798]  The globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[01:14:45.798 --> 01:14:48.680]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.301]  It's time to say no.
[01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:56.910]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:22.278]  This isn't a simulation.
[01:15:22.278 --> 01:15:24.659]  This isn't Hollywood.
[01:15:24.659 --> 01:15:26.359]  This is what Hollywood really is.
[01:15:26.359 --> 01:15:28.740]  This is who the Satanists really are.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.380]  They greedily want control of the future.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.662]  They want the souls and destinies and innocence of children.
[01:15:35.662 --> 01:15:41.343]  Here's a short compilation of some of the enemy, curling from the rooftops that our children belonged to then.
[01:15:43.365 --> 01:15:50.160]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[01:16:15.762 --> 01:16:16.783]  I'm all about education.
[01:16:42.267 --> 01:16:42.748]  Are you nervous?
[01:16:42.748 --> 01:16:42.848]  Yes.
[01:16:53.302 --> 01:16:54.383]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[01:16:54.383 --> 01:16:54.903]  No.
[01:16:54.903 --> 01:17:00.567]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[01:17:00.567 --> 01:17:06.230]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.692]  Michael likes to twerk.
[01:17:08.692 --> 01:17:12.394]  Now does anybody in this room know how to twerk?
[01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:15.436]  Turn around and shake your butt!
[01:17:15.436 --> 01:17:16.777]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[01:17:16.777 --> 01:17:19.839]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:32.807]  The hips on the drag queen go swish swish swish.
[01:17:40.795 --> 01:17:45.997]  And you're crouched down into this sort of position here, so your bum's sticking out.
[01:17:45.997 --> 01:17:48.318]  This is true child abuse right here.
[01:17:48.318 --> 01:17:51.319]  And then you just move your bum up and down like that, and that's twerking.
[01:17:51.319 --> 01:17:54.060]  This is so children don't defend themselves when they get grabbed by the guards.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:18:02.843]  A lot of the core values of being a drag queen, love, acceptance, joy, laughter, self-expression, are values that we want to instill in our kids.
[01:18:02.843 --> 01:18:09.486]  So I think it's really important that we bring this program and we spread the joy of reading and the joy of just spreading love.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.822]  So gross.
[01:18:14.822 --> 01:18:17.663]  And everywhere else it's called pedophilia.
[01:18:17.663 --> 01:18:24.887]  But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children.
[01:18:24.887 --> 01:18:27.669]  Pull up Tranny Time in the New York schools.
[01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:29.830]  This was put out in the New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:33.792]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:38.635]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on.
[01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:45.680]  Just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like, what alternate universe is this?!
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:51.684]  What planet did I wake up in?!
[01:18:51.684 --> 01:18:59.990]  Alright, now Dr. Steven Shinnick was on with us yesterday, he's gonna be joining us again because I wanted to get him on about 9-11, and then we got into a bunch of other subjects and we didn't, but we'll talk about who really...
[01:19:01.476 --> 01:19:01.996]  We're good to go.
[01:19:20.891 --> 01:19:24.692]  So, when he tells you these names and the stuff that went on, I don't just believe him.
[01:19:24.692 --> 01:19:27.673]  I did my own research and know it to be very, very accurate.
[01:19:27.673 --> 01:19:29.774]  So, we're not saying there isn't radical Islam.
[01:19:29.774 --> 01:19:31.134]  We're not saying it's not a threat.
[01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:32.495]  It was involved as a cut-out group.
[01:19:32.495 --> 01:19:37.256]  We're going to explain what happened there and now what they're doing with COVID-19 coming up next segment.
[01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:40.977]  But let's shift gears into this right now.
[01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:48.520]  I saw the footage of, and it's up on InfoWorks.com and VanDock Video, of Caitlin Bennett at a university.
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.143]  And the students start chasing her.
[01:19:54.143 --> 01:19:56.264]  Like zombies, like the zombie apocalypse.
[01:19:56.264 --> 01:19:59.346]  And it reminded me of Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:19:59.346 --> 01:20:00.927]  And they were trying to assault her.
[01:20:00.927 --> 01:20:02.388]  So this is mob psychology.
[01:20:02.388 --> 01:20:04.469]  This is Maoist psychology.
[01:20:04.469 --> 01:20:07.651]  And so, you know, what happens at this point?
[01:20:07.651 --> 01:20:12.274]  Let's go ahead and roll the footage of Kyle Rittenhouse, then we'll roll the footage of Caitlin Bennett last night.
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:37.273]  So, the mob acts the same at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, just like they act in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[01:20:37.273 --> 01:20:40.977]  So let's roll a few minutes and take a minute and a half.
[01:20:40.977 --> 01:20:41.958]  Holy fuck, bro!
[01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:43.520]  Oh, I thought we'd leave this.
[01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:52.273]  We played this in the War Room yesterday.
[01:20:52.273 --> 01:20:53.833]  And these are mainly white students.
[01:20:53.833 --> 01:20:55.974]  But they hate her because she's white.
[01:20:55.974 --> 01:20:57.294]  Holy fuck, bro!
[01:20:57.294 --> 01:20:59.055]  Guys, hit pause.
[01:20:59.055 --> 01:21:06.957]  We had a bleep version when Kaitlyn Bennett was on yesterday with, uh, Owen Schroeder in the War Room.
[01:21:06.957 --> 01:21:11.238]  Can I pretty please, sugar on top, cupcakes and everything else.
[01:21:11.238 --> 01:21:14.459]  Can I, can I, can I please have that with that bleep?
[01:21:14.459 --> 01:21:14.779]  Thank you.
[01:21:15.854 --> 01:21:20.438]  And we bleeped that out so it probably didn't make a lot of sense for some of the radio and TV stations out there.
[01:21:20.438 --> 01:21:40.974]  But let's just roll the footage then without the audio for TV viewers of them chasing her down and then trying to physically attack her to virtue signal because she's a Trump supporter and because she's a conservative that they are just going to make their bones.
[01:21:40.974 --> 01:21:42.575]  They're going to
[01:21:45.347 --> 01:21:46.928]  Attack people.
[01:21:46.928 --> 01:21:50.649]  And Kaitlin recounted all this with The War Room yesterday.
[01:21:50.649 --> 01:21:52.449]  It's up on Mandop video.
[01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:59.732]  Kaitlin Bennett recounts being attacked by a psychotic mob at Central Florida University.
[01:21:59.732 --> 01:22:01.672]  And it goes on and on.
[01:22:01.672 --> 01:22:03.553]  Again, the crew does a great job.
[01:22:03.553 --> 01:22:05.874]  Just sometimes they get another version that isn't bleeped.
[01:22:05.874 --> 01:22:07.454]  And it takes a lot of bleeping.
[01:22:07.454 --> 01:22:09.295]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, because that's what they do.
[01:22:09.295 --> 01:22:13.056]  But imagine the crazed nature of the left woke mob.
[01:22:15.251 --> 01:22:18.092]  And again, people go, well, why are you giving black folks a pass?
[01:22:18.092 --> 01:22:22.354]  Because there are a lot of black folks out doing racial attacks on whites with BLM.
[01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.155]  Absolutely.
[01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:28.877]  I'm saying in most of the videos, it's a pack of white people trying to virtue signal.
[01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:33.340]  And they do this weird thing where they go inward, inward, inward.
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.141]  And they go, I'm allowed to say it because I'm an ally.
[01:22:36.141 --> 01:22:39.062]  You're attacking journalists.
[01:22:39.062 --> 01:22:40.263]  You're attacking police.
[01:22:40.263 --> 01:22:42.404]  You're attacking the lowest level of society.
[01:22:44.301 --> 01:22:51.324]  And acting like you're fighting elites when the big money is the ones funding every damn bit of this.
[01:22:51.324 --> 01:22:53.285]  Folks, they plan to disrupt the election.
[01:22:53.285 --> 01:22:55.066]  They plan to try to overthrow Trump.
[01:22:55.066 --> 01:22:56.366]  They've said they're going to do it.
[01:22:56.366 --> 01:23:01.449]  They plan to have a great depression that they have a good chance of getting away with.
[01:23:01.449 --> 01:23:03.970]  If I was you, I'd be politically active right now.
[01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:07.411]  I'd also get high quality, affordable food and water filtration.
[01:23:07.411 --> 01:23:08.932]  We have the very best water filtration.
[01:23:10.199 --> 01:23:12.961]  The very best, high-quality, storable foods at mfortwinerestore.com.
[01:23:12.961 --> 01:23:14.822]  And I'm normally hype food.
[01:23:14.822 --> 01:23:16.724]  Food's something everybody should have a little bit of, a backup.
[01:23:16.724 --> 01:23:17.304]  It's great.
[01:23:17.304 --> 01:23:18.285]  We always promote it some.
[01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:22.848]  But I've been harping, harping, harping, because you really need the high-quality, storable food.
[01:23:22.848 --> 01:23:23.328]  We've got it now.
[01:23:23.328 --> 01:23:24.829]  It's one to two weeks for delivery.
[01:23:24.829 --> 01:23:25.630]  Everybody got their food.
[01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:27.591]  They ordered it from the whole COVID hysteria.
[01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:28.912]  I said, don't do it for that.
[01:23:28.912 --> 01:23:32.314]  Whoever the lockdown of civilization or the depression, they're trying to engineer.
[01:23:32.314 --> 01:23:35.777]  So a lot of people are ordering food right now, and I believe there's going to be a big rush on food.
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.901]  Coming up probably.
[01:23:37.901 --> 01:23:40.103]  So get ahead of the pack.
[01:23:40.103 --> 01:23:42.104]  Get ahead of the crowd.
[01:23:42.104 --> 01:23:45.167]  Get ahead of the herd and get your formal flute now while you still can.
[01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:49.070]  It's high quality and it's affordable at InfoWars4.com.
[01:23:49.070 --> 01:24:03.662]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:24:03.662 --> 01:24:05.724]  InfoWars has been banned
[01:24:08.021 --> 01:24:11.923]  Arrested.
[01:24:11.923 --> 01:24:14.704]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:24:14.704 --> 01:24:16.445]  Because we are effective.
[01:24:16.445 --> 01:24:19.826]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:24:19.826 --> 01:24:22.127]  Go to Banned.Video.

[01:24:33.544 --> 01:24:35.466]  And never give up the fight.
[01:24:35.466 --> 01:24:36.267]  InfoWars.com
[01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:53.252]  I don't want to be right about this prediction.
[01:24:53.252 --> 01:24:55.934]  In fact, it's not a prediction.
[01:24:55.934 --> 01:25:05.160]  It is a forecast that we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure of productivity.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:15.387]  It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure.
[01:25:16.067 --> 01:25:16.267]  I think?
[01:25:37.014 --> 01:25:42.656]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting storable food, and getting prepared to be self-sufficient.
[01:25:42.656 --> 01:25:45.437]  Because that's the name of their game, is to make us dependent on them.
[01:25:45.437 --> 01:25:49.118]  So get self-sufficient now in fullwars.com.
[01:25:49.118 --> 01:25:53.439]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[01:25:53.439 --> 01:26:04.223]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats
[01:26:05.323 --> 01:26:08.084]  And then if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great.
[01:26:08.084 --> 01:26:14.026]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, not essential, that we're bad for the Earth, and we need to be phased out.
[01:26:14.026 --> 01:26:24.170]  So, they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us just being very passive, living in the Matrix-like system that they're building.
[01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:32.097]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment.
[01:26:32.097 --> 01:26:34.199]  We build our own environments.
[01:26:34.199 --> 01:26:35.540]  We create our own systems.
[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:42.046]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[01:26:42.046 --> 01:26:46.691]  But instead we're acting like animals, like the globalists, play the part of humans and us as cattle.
[01:26:46.691 --> 01:26:47.552]  And that's the trick.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:27:10.421]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:27:10.421 --> 01:27:11.282]  And we are back!
[01:27:12.278 --> 01:27:15.620]  Well, I really appreciate Dr. Steve Pachinik for joining us two days in a row.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:21.924]  I wanted to get him on about 9-11 and 19 years later, which is today, but we got into a bunch of other subjects.
[01:27:21.924 --> 01:27:27.148]  And so he's here with us for two long segments, one short segment, ahead of the Hodge Brothers joining us.
[01:27:27.148 --> 01:27:29.069]  So let's plunge right into it.
[01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:32.851]  Credited with the only successful peace deal.
[01:27:32.851 --> 01:27:33.871]  Now Trump's got some.
[01:27:33.871 --> 01:27:36.252]  We hope those end up working for a while.
[01:27:36.252 --> 01:27:40.553]  But the Camp David Accord with co-founding Delta Force with General Schumacher and Boykin.
[01:27:40.553 --> 01:27:42.894]  And then of course working in other administrations.
[01:27:42.894 --> 01:27:44.494]  Worked in five administrations.
[01:27:44.494 --> 01:27:46.755]  In regime change and other clandestine operations.
[01:27:47.515 --> 01:27:50.537]  And a lot of the things he's talked about here on air, he's revealed first.
[01:27:50.537 --> 01:28:01.725]  He also co-wrote a lot of books as kind of the Jack Ryan source for what couldn't be put in a non-fiction book but was put in the Tom Clancy franchise, which a lot of those got turned into major movies.
[01:28:01.725 --> 01:28:03.887]  But in the time we have, let's just get right to it.
[01:28:03.887 --> 01:28:05.968]  What was the motive of 9-11?
[01:28:05.968 --> 01:28:07.029]  Who was behind it?
[01:28:07.029 --> 01:28:08.110]  Why is it important?
[01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:18.034]  Because, again, we're not saying radical Islam doesn't exist, we're not saying that, but clearly, the Stand Down, Building 7, how do you want to attack this up front?
[01:28:18.034 --> 01:28:22.797]  And you talk about being in rooms with top generals, you know, that said point-blank, yeah, it was an inside job.
[01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:24.197]  Dr. Steve Buchenek, thanks for your courage.
[01:28:24.197 --> 01:28:28.039]  There's no question this was an inside job.
[01:28:28.039 --> 01:28:33.001]  Before 9-11, the year before, after having helped Bush Jr.
[01:28:33.001 --> 01:28:36.063]  go into the presidency, which was my biggest mistake,
[01:28:37.044 --> 01:28:43.529]  I went around to the Department of Defense and I was asked to look for specific jobs.
[01:28:43.529 --> 01:28:46.191]  And as I went around, I saw something very unusual.
[01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:54.076]  I saw CIA operatives in every military position that I was interested in, from Salt Lake to other areas.
[01:28:54.076 --> 01:28:54.777]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:55.393 --> 01:29:08.303]  I went to Andy Marshall, who was the head of the office in that assessment, trained at the University of Chicago, never served in the war, but I knew he was in charge of Cheney, Rumsfeld, Zalmay Khalilzad, a whole bunch of neocons.
[01:29:08.303 --> 01:29:20.172]  And what in fact happened a year later, four months before 9-11, I had a knock on the door from two Mossad operatives who really didn't know what they were doing.
[01:29:20.172 --> 01:29:23.435]  They were quite stupid, which I think Mossad is normally.
[01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:27.617]  They knocked on the door and Chevy chased and asked if they could use my phone.
[01:29:27.617 --> 01:29:29.598]  I said, under no condition.
[01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:30.398]  They pursued.
[01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:31.879]  I threw them out.
[01:29:31.879 --> 01:29:37.722]  So when 9-11 came around, the first person they had to ask about what happened was me.
[01:29:37.722 --> 01:29:40.583]  And I said, there's no question this is an inside job.
[01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:43.625]  Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice,
[01:29:44.125 --> 01:29:49.610]  Colin Powell, Steve Hadley, Frank Fukuyama, Richard Perle, I knew them all.
[01:29:49.610 --> 01:30:00.200]  Most of them went to Cornell and the rest went to Yale and I said these are the corrupt cowards, what we call chicken hawks, who are involved in creating a 9-11.
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.541]  Now how did I know that?
[01:30:01.541 --> 01:30:07.126]  Not only did I go around and see Doug Fyfe and others who never belonged at Department of Defense,
[01:30:07.726 --> 01:30:16.051]  I also questioned one of my neighbors, who in fact was a CIA operative at DOD and knew the entire story.
[01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:21.675]  And I got from her the entire story of who was involved, the names and people involved.
[01:30:21.675 --> 01:30:26.918]  I put it in the book, American Warrior in Crisis, if people want to look at the various names.
[01:30:26.918 --> 01:30:36.384]  The key point was that Cheney Rumsfeld, Cheney in particular, whom I knew from the Nixon administration as I did Rumsfeld, was a coward.
[01:30:36.904 --> 01:30:41.386]  Probably the most treasonous coward we have ever had in the United States.
[01:30:41.386 --> 01:30:47.249]  He refused to serve us in Vietnam 11 different times with the assistance of his wife.
[01:30:47.249 --> 01:30:50.651]  And now he has a daughter who to me, it's absurd.
[01:30:50.651 --> 01:30:53.212]  So what did we learn from that event?
[01:30:53.212 --> 01:30:54.352]  Nothing.
[01:30:54.352 --> 01:31:00.835]  What I learned from it is number one, the military can be manipulated and really can't win a war.
[01:31:00.835 --> 01:31:05.958]  Our intelligence service, all the way from the CIA, Gina Haspel to Tenet,
[01:31:06.576 --> 01:31:12.343]  To all the others who were in charge, Robert Goss, they were all compromised and were involved.
[01:31:13.064 --> 01:31:15.006]  Number four, I knew Bush Jr.
[01:31:15.006 --> 01:31:22.232]  was involved in the same way his father, Bush Sr., was involved in creating a war in the Middle East, which we had no reason to do.
[01:31:22.232 --> 01:31:27.956]  Both men, not only Bush Jr., had failed in the military.
[01:31:27.956 --> 01:31:32.900]  Contrary to the myth that's propagated about Bush Sr., he was not a war hero.
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:36.864]  He bailed out of a plane and allowed eight of his airmen to die.
[01:31:36.864 --> 01:31:38.425]  He was a coward.
[01:31:38.425 --> 01:31:40.867]  Bush Jr., a coward, corrupt.
[01:31:41.307 --> 01:31:43.008]  Cheney, a coward.
[01:31:43.008 --> 01:31:45.170]  I said to Rumsfeld, you're a coward.
[01:31:45.170 --> 01:31:47.211]  I know exactly what you did.
[01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:51.474]  He went on the radio the next day after I accused him and the administration.
[01:31:51.474 --> 01:32:02.161]  He said, if somebody accuses the Republicans of doing 9-11, which is called a false flag and a standout, then you have to accuse the Democrats for doing Pearl Harbor.
[01:32:02.641 --> 01:32:09.025]  Well, as many of you know, the false flags of Pearl Harbor means that we knew exactly what was going to happen at Pearl Harbor.
[01:32:09.025 --> 01:32:14.069]  We wanted to sacrifice 3,000 to 4,000 men in order to precipitate a war.
[01:32:14.069 --> 01:32:20.633]  Same way the LBJ had a false flag in Vietnam, John F. Kennedy had a false flag in New York.
[01:32:20.633 --> 01:32:24.135]  Let me stop you, and that's absolutely true, and let's just go back.
[01:32:24.135 --> 01:32:28.798]  Rebuilding America's defenses, April 1st, 2020, Dick Cheney pins that
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.185]  I don't know how they hit it just right less than a year later.
[01:32:36.185 --> 01:32:37.567]  I mean, they really did a good job.
[01:32:43.191 --> 01:32:45.332]  Well, it's not that they did a good job.
[01:32:45.332 --> 01:32:47.132]  They were craven individuals.
[01:32:47.132 --> 01:32:49.593]  Zalmay Khalasad worked for me on the West Bank.
[01:32:49.593 --> 01:32:50.893]  He's a disaster.
[01:32:50.893 --> 01:32:53.634]  He's been in... He created the war in Afghanistan.
[01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:55.034]  He's a CIA operative.
[01:32:55.034 --> 01:32:55.314]  Sure, sure.
[01:32:55.314 --> 01:32:57.915]  I was being sarcastic, but I mean, so you knew before it even came in.
[01:32:57.915 --> 01:32:59.935]  You were a big member of the CFR, all of this.
[01:32:59.935 --> 01:33:01.636]  I remember you resigned after all of this.
[01:33:02.717 --> 01:33:12.503]  I left because I knew exactly who in the CFR was involved in 9-11, and I told them, I'm going to be the first American to leave your organization in, what, 120 years?
[01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:13.943]  I couldn't care less.
[01:33:13.943 --> 01:33:28.171]  The CFR was compromised, you had the United States government compromised, our military intelligence, our civilian intelligence, our Department of Justice was compromised, the White House was compromised, and the House of Representatives.
[01:33:28.171 --> 01:33:29.012]  Anything else left?
[01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:49.454]  Then what they did was to turn around the narrative and say, God, we are conspiracy truthers, as if we have the burden in order to explain why this coward and moron who was elected twice was involved in a 9-11 stand down and false flag.
[01:33:49.454 --> 01:33:53.616]  And we had the biggest coward in our history, a treasonous man.
[01:33:53.616 --> 01:33:55.297]  He should have been taken out.
[01:33:55.297 --> 01:33:56.597]  He should have gone to jail.
[01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:57.658]  Of course, nobody did it.
[01:33:58.158 --> 01:33:59.679]  Cheney didn't go to jail.
[01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:01.159]  Rumsfeld didn't go to jail.
[01:34:01.159 --> 01:34:04.820]  By the way, Black Lives Matter, I'm gonna be very nice.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:10.042]  We had Colin Powell, Secretary of State, a pathological liar.
[01:34:10.042 --> 01:34:12.463]  In Vietnam, he lied about the incidents.
[01:34:12.463 --> 01:34:16.164]  And then when he was in the Bush administration, he lied about anthrax.
[01:34:16.164 --> 01:34:18.685]  He was as dumb as they come out of CCNY.
[01:34:18.685 --> 01:34:20.846]  Let's talk about what was the motive of 9-11.
[01:34:20.846 --> 01:34:22.546]  What's the motive?
[01:34:22.546 --> 01:34:25.187]  Let me give you another equal opportunity.
[01:34:26.016 --> 01:34:29.418]  Condoleezza Rice, whom I knew very well from Stanford.
[01:34:29.418 --> 01:34:34.922]  She told Willie Brown, do not fly to New York that week, and so was the Joint Chiefs was told.
[01:34:34.922 --> 01:34:36.703]  That's all on record.
[01:34:36.703 --> 01:34:37.404]  Correct.
[01:34:37.404 --> 01:34:42.427]  But she was a liar, national security advisor, a coward.
[01:34:42.427 --> 01:34:43.728]  And what do they do?
[01:34:43.728 --> 01:34:45.309]  They retread everybody.
[01:34:45.309 --> 01:34:49.652]  The Hoover Institute right now, you got John Woo, you got Condoleezza Rice.
[01:34:49.652 --> 01:34:52.414]  And I said to the Hoover Institute, stick it up.
[01:34:53.391 --> 01:34:54.831]  You're out of control.
[01:34:54.831 --> 01:34:57.972]  The Rand Corporation, all of these guys out of control.
[01:34:57.972 --> 01:35:03.034]  And unfortunately for me, I knew, I was not surprised because I'm not a cynic.
[01:35:03.034 --> 01:35:03.874]  I'm a realist.
[01:35:03.874 --> 01:35:05.314]  I grew up in Europe.
[01:35:05.314 --> 01:35:07.675]  I saw the French collaborate with the Germans.
[01:35:07.675 --> 01:35:14.737]  I saw the French beat up Algerians, Moroccans, and then assassinate one million Tutsis in Rwanda.
[01:35:15.453 --> 01:35:21.656]  What I know is that we have lied and we have prevaricated and we killed our own people.
[01:35:21.656 --> 01:35:24.318]  Not the first time, not the last time.
[01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:29.661]  But if anybody comes out to be sanctimonious about it, they better be careful.
[01:35:29.661 --> 01:35:38.025]  Because I was the first one interviewed in this entire episode and I said under no condition was this Islamic terrorist.
[01:35:38.025 --> 01:35:42.848]  Well let's talk about that, but you also said right after it happened you met with a top general who confirmed to you it was staged.
[01:35:43.885 --> 01:35:45.186]  Correct.
[01:35:45.186 --> 01:35:48.929]  And I said to the generals, and I sat down with them, I'm not going to name them.
[01:35:48.929 --> 01:35:50.971]  I said, you have two choices.
[01:35:50.971 --> 01:35:59.999]  Either you resign and I'm going to court-martial you, or you start to rethink what you're doing and get the civilians out of the Pentagon.
[01:36:00.399 --> 01:36:03.062]  That meant Doug Fyfe, Paul Wolfowitz.
[01:36:03.062 --> 01:36:18.315]  Eventually, Paul Wolfowitz, a pathetic, cowardly individual who came out of Cornell University, by the way, one of the big universities to push 9-11, it had Paul Wolfowitz, it had Steve Hadley, Frank Fukuyama,
[01:36:18.915 --> 01:36:21.877]  And Sandy Berger from the Clinton Administration.
[01:36:21.877 --> 01:36:24.478]  Cornell never said a word.
[01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:24.898]  Stay there.
[01:36:24.898 --> 01:36:26.599]  I know people that are in the know understand what you're saying.
[01:36:26.599 --> 01:36:27.540]  Most listeners do as well.
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.281]  But let's almost say dumb it down.
[01:36:29.281 --> 01:36:30.862]  But let's just walk through this one and come back.
[01:36:30.862 --> 01:36:35.184]  Because you have this civilian taking over the military, but they don't know about the consequences.
[01:36:35.184 --> 01:36:36.925]  And they do these crazy false flags.
[01:36:36.925 --> 01:36:40.307]  We didn't see a revolution in the military after all this to try to kick them out.
[01:36:40.307 --> 01:36:41.607]  How has that gone?
[01:36:41.607 --> 01:36:44.749]  And has Trump the culmination of that revolution to get the U.S.
[01:36:44.749 --> 01:36:46.230]  military back in control of themselves?
[01:36:48.462 --> 01:37:02.089]  Well, Mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with Bloomberg to launch this Operation Red Mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night.
[01:37:02.089 --> 01:37:03.230]  Now he's come out with a statement.
[01:37:03.670 --> 01:37:04.231]  We're good to go.
[01:37:24.767 --> 01:37:32.514]  Trump is surrounded by tyrants, but he has we the people and he has true media, not independent media, the real media.
[01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:48.467]  So now more than ever, it's critical to share the live streams, the videos, the articles and the information at Infowars.com because the globalists fear it most because we were the first to expose their plan to contest the election and drag it out to keep the American people from reelecting President Trump.
[01:37:48.467 --> 01:37:51.110]  The clock is ticking on the once free world.
[01:37:52.216 --> 01:37:55.419]  And the free press is under attack more than ever.
[01:37:55.419 --> 01:38:05.947]  I now see videos 10 or 15 times a day, without even trying to find them, of press being arrested in the United States, press being arrested in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand.
[01:38:05.947 --> 01:38:10.691]  And it's always the so-called liberal left, the defenders of speech, doing it.
[01:38:10.691 --> 01:38:17.737]  They are the authoritarians, they work for the Qaikom Globalist Combine, and they are working around the clock
[01:38:18.698 --> 01:38:20.479]  To silence InfoWars.
[01:38:20.479 --> 01:38:25.642]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything new on us.
[01:38:25.642 --> 01:38:28.223]  And a lot of it I can't get into on air at this point.
[01:38:28.223 --> 01:38:29.344]  I'll be able to reveal this later.
[01:38:29.344 --> 01:38:36.147]  But I just want to make you all realize that your support, your word of mouth, your prayer is absolutely essential.
[01:38:36.147 --> 01:38:37.828]  And I thank you all for it.
[01:38:37.828 --> 01:38:45.172]  But whatever you do, take advantage of the great products that support the InfoWar and make your life healthier and better at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:38:45.172 --> 01:38:46.713]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:38:49.551 --> 01:39:08.798]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, The Washington Post, or Howard Stern, you name it, they come out and they attack him full force, saying, Jones claims civil war is coming, and financial collapse, and planetary lockdowns using viruses, and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have storable food, if they can.
[01:39:09.378 --> 01:39:16.567]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like lockstep.
[01:39:16.567 --> 01:39:19.731]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[01:39:19.731 --> 01:39:25.599]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last week more than ever.
[01:39:25.919 --> 01:39:27.139]  Ignorance does not equal bliss.
[01:39:27.139 --> 01:39:28.260]  Ignorance equals slavery.
[01:39:55.441 --> 01:40:02.768]  If you're ignorant, walking through a field at night, that there's a six-foot hole up ahead, you're gonna step in it and probably break your ankle.
[01:40:02.768 --> 01:40:04.029]  Or maybe worse.
[01:40:04.029 --> 01:40:06.432]  Well, it's the same thing happening to human civilization.
[01:40:07.332 --> 01:40:15.877]  The industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects, but also took us away from the land and made us very, very domesticated and very, very easy to manipulate.
[01:40:15.877 --> 01:40:20.159]  And now corruption and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity.
[01:40:20.159 --> 01:40:31.565]  Now, I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group and all their subsidiaries, like the Club of Rome, say.
[01:40:31.565 --> 01:40:33.907]  So I know exactly what's going on.
[01:40:34.827 --> 01:40:42.270]  Not because I'm even that cool or special a person, but I actually want to be empowered and informed because I'm a history buff.
[01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:44.410]  I know that those that don't know history are going to repeat it.
[01:40:44.410 --> 01:40:45.571]  The globalists think you're stupid.
[01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:51.953]  They laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions.
[01:40:51.953 --> 01:40:54.534]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:25.026 --> 01:41:28.328]  We're not going to take it lying down.
[01:41:28.328 --> 01:41:31.650]  Look, I went on air that day and knew those were controlled demolitions.
[01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:35.032]  I heard them say they blew up Building 7, the CIA headquarters.
[01:41:35.032 --> 01:41:39.695]  I got physically sick on air seeing elements of our government did that because I love America.
[01:41:39.695 --> 01:41:41.717]  I knew it was globalist imposters.
[01:41:41.717 --> 01:41:46.380]  And people asked me once Obama got in and things moved on why I didn't cover 9-11 as much.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:42:04.346]  Well, because it was about getting that group of neocons and who did that, and I was still exposing false flags, but just I wasn't making my fifth or sixth film on it, I wasn't harping on it every day, because people would think then that the government did it when it was criminal elements that did it, and so it actually became destructive with the country.
[01:42:04.346 --> 01:42:05.406]  So I want to be clear.
[01:42:05.406 --> 01:42:07.186]  People ask, why didn't you keep harping on 9-11?
[01:42:07.186 --> 01:42:14.269]  I still talk about it quite a bit, we have guests on, it's important to revisit sometimes, but how do you expose the criminal elements that did this,
[01:42:15.171 --> 01:42:24.533]  While at the same time, not destroying patriotism and having it blow back, like the left uses 9-11 to hurt America, when I don't really see it as America that was doing it.
[01:42:24.533 --> 01:42:29.234]  You're not just a psychiatrist, you're a, you know, an old school hand of the world, Dr. Pachinik.
[01:42:29.234 --> 01:42:31.494]  I mean, how do we address something?
[01:42:31.494 --> 01:42:41.796]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall, but, you know, at a certain point, I still talk about 9-11, but justice never happened, so then it almost just becomes destructive to constantly cover it.
[01:42:43.379 --> 01:42:45.341]  Not really, my friend.
[01:42:45.341 --> 01:42:48.625]  We will not see justice vis-a-vis this issue.
[01:42:48.625 --> 01:42:49.326]  We will not.
[01:42:49.326 --> 01:42:51.108]  I mean, that's just a point of fact.
[01:42:51.108 --> 01:42:54.593]  That's exactly what I've learned the day after that.
[01:42:54.593 --> 01:42:55.614]  No one would be held
[01:42:56.101 --> 01:42:56.941]  Accountable.
[01:42:56.941 --> 01:42:59.442]  You and I can repeat the story.
[01:42:59.442 --> 01:43:04.845]  We will be put in Wikipedia as truthers, as conspiracy theorists.
[01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:09.427]  That's the price that you and I pay for telling the truth.
[01:43:09.427 --> 01:43:15.349]  It's the same price when I said, look, Abraham Lincoln was not a great liberator of slaves.
[01:43:15.349 --> 01:43:16.710]  He was a tyrant.
[01:43:16.710 --> 01:43:21.512]  When he was assassinated, the words were, thus always with tyrants.
[01:43:22.132 --> 01:43:27.073]  And so we create our own narratives which are totally false.
[01:43:27.073 --> 01:43:28.793]  You and I will continue that.
[01:43:28.793 --> 01:43:30.714]  People will cover that over.
[01:43:30.714 --> 01:43:33.615]  When you see Wikipedia, it's pathetic.
[01:43:33.615 --> 01:43:37.695]  When I was reading exactly what happened in 9-11, it was pathetic.
[01:43:37.695 --> 01:43:43.137]  So they had a separate section which said, truthers, what the truthers say.
[01:43:43.137 --> 01:43:46.157]  And that's how pathetic intellectualism.
[01:43:46.157 --> 01:43:49.618]  You're talking about the end of American intellectualism.
[01:43:50.018 --> 01:43:54.399]  You're talking about the end of a capacity that we had at one time.
[01:43:54.399 --> 01:43:58.740]  No, but I agree, but at the time we have, we come back with five hours to do this again because it's so important historically.
[01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:01.341]  Because I want to cover, I just want to cover it right.
[01:44:01.341 --> 01:44:06.902]  I know you have a lot of gravitas in this area and what you're saying is a key witness to all this, Dr. Buchanan.
[01:44:06.902 --> 01:44:13.004]  So if the neocons and others are behind it, they wanted it for domestic police state to take over the Middle East.
[01:44:13.004 --> 01:44:15.104]  In context of 2020, why is it important?
[01:44:18.277 --> 01:44:29.866]  Because you have to understand now that we have a system that really doesn't always work for the people and by the people, except for one little notation, which is important.
[01:44:30.532 --> 01:44:39.180]  We have a new person who has not been part of the CIA, not been part of the military, not been part of anything other than business.
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:42.503]  And his job today is to do business.
[01:44:42.503 --> 01:44:45.466]  And that's the only salvation we have.
[01:44:45.466 --> 01:44:51.832]  So it's the maverick, sui generis, of his own kind thing is why they hate Trump.
[01:44:51.832 --> 01:44:54.455]  And the sui generis movement is the answer.
[01:44:55.319 --> 01:44:55.859]  Correct.
[01:44:55.859 --> 01:45:14.045]  I mean, we, for whatever reasons, we allowed and created a man to come in at this point whom, ironically, everybody involved in 9-11, including the Democrats, and Biden was involved, and the Clintons were involved, and the Bushes, says, oh, he's a pathological liar.
[01:45:14.045 --> 01:45:14.745]  Really?
[01:45:14.745 --> 01:45:18.526]  Have you seen the videos of the day after he said they clearly blew the towers up with bombs?
[01:45:19.434 --> 01:45:19.994]  Correct.
[01:45:19.994 --> 01:45:29.461]  And not only did I see them, but I also heard him say on the same day, because I had followed Trump for over 30, 40 years, he said, my, those buildings are pretty strong.
[01:45:29.461 --> 01:45:31.862]  I wonder how they can bring him down.
[01:45:31.862 --> 01:45:35.785]  So he was basically saying exactly what everybody else knew.
[01:45:35.785 --> 01:45:39.908]  Now, he will play the part of a president that continues that narrative.
[01:45:40.328 --> 01:45:44.712]  But beyond that, he will not trust anybody, and correctly so.
[01:45:44.712 --> 01:45:46.995]  He has his own family to work with.
[01:45:46.995 --> 01:45:52.580]  That's why they call him dumb, because he doesn't tell any of those people what he really thinks.
[01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:52.960]  Really?
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:54.902]  I mean, it's what you and I talked about.
[01:45:54.902 --> 01:45:58.686]  You're that dumb that you created all these condominiums?
[01:45:58.686 --> 01:45:59.066]  Three?
[01:45:59.066 --> 01:46:02.510]  You're that dumb you just beat the whole deep state and then held them off for four years?
[01:46:03.795 --> 01:46:08.798]  Of course, and became a multi-billionaire several times over, although he had bankruptcy.
[01:46:08.798 --> 01:46:10.399]  I'd like to be that dumb.
[01:46:10.399 --> 01:46:16.002]  I want to be as dumb as somebody like that who can basically say whatever you want to hear, Woodward.
[01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:18.063]  And by the way, Woodward is now getting it.
[01:46:18.063 --> 01:46:20.244]  Congratulations to you, Alex.
[01:46:20.244 --> 01:46:24.867]  They want to know why Woodward held it for six months, that particular secret.
[01:46:24.867 --> 01:46:28.949]  It was far more lethal because Woodward, once again, is a coward.
[01:46:29.309 --> 01:46:32.470]  He's a CIA operative out of Yale.
[01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:33.590]  It doesn't change.
[01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:36.551]  These people have been highly compromised.
[01:46:36.551 --> 01:46:41.712]  A friend of mine said to me, why are you attacking the CIA when I was trained by it?
[01:46:41.712 --> 01:46:44.093]  And I said to this friend who was head of the U.S.
[01:46:44.093 --> 01:46:52.695]  Institute of Peace and came out of MIT, I said to him, you will see why I never belonged to anything except the Republic.
[01:46:53.505 --> 01:46:55.529]  I was allowed to join the military.
[01:46:55.529 --> 01:46:57.131]  I served five presidents.
[01:46:57.131 --> 01:47:03.742]  Because you've got to owe allegiance to the idea and the people and the dirt, not to some corrupt Ivy League elitist institution.
[01:47:04.659 --> 01:47:06.401]  That's exactly what happened.
[01:47:06.401 --> 01:47:16.130]  And I said, I pledge allegiance to the Republic, that's why I came back with the generals, Keith Alexander and others, and said, this is your time to be in charge.
[01:47:16.130 --> 01:47:20.214]  No more Rumsfeld, no more Cheney's, no more Bush's.
[01:47:20.214 --> 01:47:21.896]  I don't want chicken hawks here.
[01:47:21.896 --> 01:47:26.781]  I want guys who think... Why do you think Alexander's going over to Amazon?
[01:47:26.781 --> 01:47:27.601]  I'm sorry?
[01:47:27.601 --> 01:47:28.522]  Keith Alexander?
[01:47:28.522 --> 01:47:28.602]  Yeah.
[01:47:29.955 --> 01:47:33.142]  I'll tell you, he is very, very bright.
[01:47:33.142 --> 01:47:35.788]  You said for a long time he'd be the good head of Cyber Command.
[01:47:36.598 --> 01:47:46.260]  Correct, and he was head of Cyber Command and then his junior subordinate, Nakasone, who's head of Cyber Command, also excellent.
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.900]  Keith went to the Academy.
[01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:49.241]  Nakasone did not.
[01:47:49.241 --> 01:47:56.322]  And then I'm proposing a General Brown for the Air Force to be head of Space Command and Space Warfare.
[01:47:56.322 --> 01:47:59.663]  So we have people on board who are going to be able to do things.
[01:47:59.663 --> 01:48:02.263]  I'm proud that Keith will take over Amazon.
[01:48:02.263 --> 01:48:02.984]  They need him.
[01:48:02.984 --> 01:48:04.564]  He understands cyber control.
[01:48:05.084 --> 01:48:07.525]  The world has changed in 20 years.
[01:48:07.525 --> 01:48:11.625]  Number one, you have become a predominant source of information.
[01:48:11.625 --> 01:48:13.006]  The New York Times is done.
[01:48:13.006 --> 01:48:14.606]  The Washington Post is done.
[01:48:14.606 --> 01:48:16.146]  The Wall Street Journal is done.
[01:48:16.146 --> 01:48:19.827]  I was going to say, I don't know if I've become the prominent thing, but definitely part of it.
[01:48:19.827 --> 01:48:20.827]  But yeah, what are they going to do?
[01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:22.708]  Because no one believes a damn word they say.
[01:48:22.708 --> 01:48:27.549]  And they just keep, like CNN especially, is like a zombie undead creature that won't go away.
[01:48:27.549 --> 01:48:29.009]  But no one listens to it.
[01:48:30.376 --> 01:48:32.857]  I mean, what do you want about Anderson Cooper?
[01:48:32.857 --> 01:48:39.459]  He's an openly gay guy who forgets to tell you he had two internships at the CIA.
[01:48:39.459 --> 01:48:41.780]  And once again, he too is compromised.
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:47.682]  It's almost as if every one of them checked their brains right at the agency or somewhere else.
[01:48:47.682 --> 01:48:53.205]  But the truth of the matter is I could care less about the CIA or the other 16 intelligence units.
[01:48:53.205 --> 01:48:53.985]  They're useless.
[01:48:55.166 --> 01:48:57.227]  The issue is these people are followers.
[01:48:57.227 --> 01:48:58.589]  Who is in control of them?
[01:48:58.589 --> 01:49:02.312]  Because whoever's in control is pretty stupid.
[01:49:02.312 --> 01:49:07.076]  They were stupid, but there's a new guy who's in control and his name is Grinnell.
[01:49:07.076 --> 01:49:12.781]  And I listened to how he was handling the issues as a former ambassador to Germany.
[01:49:12.781 --> 01:49:14.202]  Insightful.
[01:49:14.202 --> 01:49:14.663]  Smart.
[01:49:14.663 --> 01:49:17.585]  Oh yeah, he confronted the media and said, don't you understand last week?
[01:49:17.585 --> 01:49:18.386]  You're obsolete.
[01:49:19.284 --> 01:49:20.065]  Correct.
[01:49:20.065 --> 01:49:21.606]  And he said, you're not relevant.
[01:49:21.606 --> 01:49:22.607]  You're immature.
[01:49:22.607 --> 01:49:23.528]  You're childish.
[01:49:23.528 --> 01:49:25.951]  Let me tell you about Serbia and Kosovo.
[01:49:25.951 --> 01:49:28.373]  And somebody wanted to ask him about being gay.
[01:49:28.373 --> 01:49:30.195]  He said, it's not relevant.
[01:49:30.195 --> 01:49:31.956]  Let's talk about policy.
[01:49:31.956 --> 01:49:41.446]  So I think he, Trump put in a great guy in the intelligence network, and I hope he takes down a lot of it, reorganizes it, use Wilbur Ross.
[01:49:41.926 --> 01:49:43.227]  Well that's my next question.
[01:49:43.227 --> 01:49:47.029]  If Trump gets four more years, which we hope he does, I think it needs a really clean house.
[01:49:47.029 --> 01:49:49.050]  Let's talk about when we come back, how you would do that.
[01:49:49.050 --> 01:49:53.452]  You were called in some demonstrations to clean house because we've got to remove all this dead wood.
[01:49:53.452 --> 01:49:55.012]  These people are crazy.
[01:49:55.012 --> 01:50:00.275]  And now it's come out that Robert Mueller was wiping all the phones illegally, didn't even care.
[01:50:00.275 --> 01:50:05.818]  Like he was above the law and they were, I mean, this is just, these people are crazy.
[01:50:05.818 --> 01:50:07.298]  They're not crazy what they are.
[01:50:08.627 --> 01:50:22.698]  You know Mueller served us well in Vietnam and then he had to what we got what we call suck up to power and Mueller should be ashamed of himself because as an Episcopalian he really
[01:50:23.542 --> 01:50:24.662]  Degraded.
[01:50:24.662 --> 01:50:29.064]  He denigrated both our country and both his own religion.
[01:50:29.064 --> 01:50:32.265]  And to this day, he is never saying mea culpa.
[01:50:32.265 --> 01:50:36.687]  This is an intellectual who should have gone out of his way to say, I'm not going to do it.
[01:50:36.687 --> 01:50:40.588]  Well, did he not look completely broken in testimony last year?
[01:50:40.588 --> 01:50:43.189]  I mean, he looked like a ghost.
[01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.549]  Correct.
[01:50:43.549 --> 01:50:49.071]  He was totally unintelligible, but none of them have come forward and say mea culpa.
[01:50:49.071 --> 01:50:50.432]  I've made a mistake.
[01:50:50.432 --> 01:50:51.552]  I wanted reform.
[01:50:52.296 --> 01:50:57.358]  So the notion of Judeo-Christian overtones in this society is nonsense.
[01:50:57.358 --> 01:50:59.318]  It's just a myth.
[01:50:59.318 --> 01:51:00.859]  And what comes forth?
[01:51:00.859 --> 01:51:03.780]  You've got the Alex Jones, alternative media.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:09.121]  Dr. Persim, we've got to go to berekseversenate.com, but what I'm asking is, I agree with you, they're a bunch of order followers.
[01:51:09.121 --> 01:51:10.161]  So who's in command?
[01:51:10.161 --> 01:51:10.962]  Obama?
[01:51:10.962 --> 01:51:11.762]  Hillary?
[01:51:11.762 --> 01:51:12.262]  Soros?
[01:51:12.262 --> 01:51:17.904]  Because I study these people and I watch them, and they have to like, they get a script, they follow it, even after they've lost.
[01:51:18.444 --> 01:51:20.265]  They're still following three-year-old scripts.
[01:51:20.265 --> 01:51:22.006]  Like, there's no one in command.
[01:51:22.006 --> 01:51:25.468]  They're following the last election and fighting the last war.
[01:51:25.468 --> 01:51:26.629]  And that's actually horrifying.
[01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:28.110]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:29.451]  Final segment of our Seattle Chin-Ink.
[01:51:29.451 --> 01:51:32.193]  Then the Hodge twins, who are megaviral, join us.
[01:51:32.193 --> 01:51:33.854]  Stay with us for 52 Days.
[01:51:38.388 --> 01:51:45.372]  Ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and are so incredibly anti-human?
[01:51:45.372 --> 01:51:46.813]  Love to censor people.
[01:51:46.813 --> 01:51:50.615]  Love to hover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships.
[01:51:50.615 --> 01:51:51.775]  Well, it's very simple.
[01:51:51.775 --> 01:51:58.159]  The first computers ever created were created by Thomas Watson, the founder and owner of IBM, to carry out eugenics.
[01:51:58.159 --> 01:52:00.280]  And they helped run the death camps in Nazi Germany.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.981]  That's what the tattoos were on the slaves' arms.
[01:52:02.981 --> 01:52:04.382]  It would decide who lived and who died.
[01:52:04.562 --> 01:52:10.906]  So from the beginning, it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets, and making humans obsolete.
[01:52:10.906 --> 01:52:16.069]  The same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein and fat in it to make your child's brain small.
[01:52:16.069 --> 01:52:21.992]  The same people that said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers, that lowers IQs about 20 points on average as well.
[01:52:21.992 --> 01:52:29.036]  These are hardcore eugenicists, survival of the fittest, social Darwinists, grow up world, admit the truth, quit being
[01:52:29.356 --> 01:52:30.758]  They are your mortal enemy.
[01:52:30.758 --> 01:52:31.598]  They want you dead.
[01:52:31.598 --> 01:52:32.479]  Do you understand that?
[01:52:39.994 --> 01:52:51.305]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you'd think it was magic.
[01:52:51.305 --> 01:52:54.948]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[01:52:54.948 --> 01:52:58.551]  So for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[01:52:59.592 --> 01:53:07.714]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animals know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[01:53:07.714 --> 01:53:09.754]  They're following magnetic lines.
[01:53:09.754 --> 01:53:12.195]  They have magnetic cells in their brains.
[01:53:12.195 --> 01:53:14.775]  We now know scientifically what's going on, but there's even a lot more than that.
[01:53:14.775 --> 01:53:18.856]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter.
[01:53:18.856 --> 01:53:21.636]  We're talking about all the things you don't understand, but we know it's there.
[01:53:21.636 --> 01:53:24.777]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system,
[01:53:25.437 --> 01:53:41.847]  That's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people, and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it, because it is a consciousness manipulated through the space-time continuum.
[01:53:41.847 --> 01:53:44.469]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:15.112 --> 01:54:16.373]  We are back live.
[01:54:16.373 --> 01:54:17.574]  Ted Newton bringing us in.
[01:54:17.574 --> 01:54:19.895]  Alright, Steve Pachetnik, StevePachetnik.com.
[01:54:19.895 --> 01:54:20.576]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:54:20.576 --> 01:54:23.518]  We really appreciate you giving us all this time.
[01:54:23.518 --> 01:54:24.899]  In the four or five minutes we have left,
[01:54:26.581 --> 01:54:32.242]  I mean, the question I was getting into is a little esoteric, but who is in command of the left?
[01:54:32.242 --> 01:54:34.123]  Why do they go out of their way to destroy themselves?
[01:54:34.123 --> 01:54:36.484]  I don't get self-destruction at that level.
[01:54:36.484 --> 01:54:39.464]  And what do you expect them to do in this election?
[01:54:39.464 --> 01:54:42.545]  What should we be watching for in closing?
[01:54:42.545 --> 01:54:45.286]  Basically, you've got nobody in command of this left.
[01:54:45.286 --> 01:54:52.828]  What's happening is basically a conglomerate of ineffectual people who had an ideology that once was vibrant for them.
[01:54:53.542 --> 01:54:57.587]  But you have a Soros who's funding some things, the Hillary Clintons.
[01:54:57.587 --> 01:54:58.969]  They're just names.
[01:54:58.969 --> 01:55:03.074]  At this particular point in time, you're not going to have a Democratic Party.
[01:55:03.074 --> 01:55:06.179]  As far as I'm concerned, the Republican Party is gone.
[01:55:06.179 --> 01:55:08.742]  The party that really is in power is called Trump.
[01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:14.382]  And he will appoint those people he needs in order to affect change.
[01:55:14.382 --> 01:55:20.264]  The notion of ideological parties at the time of the social media is antiquated.
[01:55:20.264 --> 01:55:27.226]  What's relevant now are little pieces of information that comes across at different times on the Internet, social media.
[01:55:27.646 --> 01:55:29.847]  Most people are getting addicted to it.
[01:55:29.847 --> 01:55:32.849]  But in reality, the parties are really antiquated.
[01:55:32.849 --> 01:55:34.870]  You don't need a House of Representatives.
[01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:36.431]  You don't need a Senate.
[01:55:36.431 --> 01:55:38.512]  Those are just welfare victims.
[01:55:38.512 --> 01:55:40.473]  What you do need are the governors.
[01:55:40.473 --> 01:55:42.174]  And Abbott is important.
[01:55:42.174 --> 01:55:45.136]  DeSantis in Florida is exceedingly important.
[01:55:45.136 --> 01:55:49.558]  Because he can do whatever he wants and he can defy the principles of the federal government.
[01:55:50.018 --> 01:55:54.641]  The federal government is already breaking up in terms of a cyber nation.
[01:55:54.641 --> 01:55:59.644]  The two ends of the East and the West and the South are really non-functional anymore.
[01:55:59.644 --> 01:56:01.204]  The cities are empty.
[01:56:01.204 --> 01:56:05.647]  So what you have is a new era where a businessman is coming in.
[01:56:06.207 --> 01:56:10.109]  He will create peace in different areas of the world.
[01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:16.412]  Bahrain will be the next one in terms of a peace treaty, then Oman and then Saudi Arabia.
[01:56:16.412 --> 01:56:21.814]  Then I predict he will have a treaty with Iran and China and North Korea.
[01:56:21.814 --> 01:56:33.420]  So what will happen is we expand in peacefully, externally, internally, we'll be imploding pretty much around the democratic cities and the major cities that are controlled by Democrats.
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:34.240]  Why?
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:41.602]  It has to do with the fact that most of them are pretty ineffectual in terms of creating a business or running anything.
[01:56:41.602 --> 01:56:44.402]  Como has never run a business.
[01:56:44.402 --> 01:56:50.444]  Como's mother is a lovely person whom I know, but both sons are totally dysfunctional.
[01:56:50.444 --> 01:56:54.125]  They can talk, they create process, but nothing else.
[01:56:54.125 --> 01:56:59.726]  So when you're in the business of process, unlike you and I, where we have a product, you have a product,
[01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:04.147]  You have vitamins, you have a content, I have content.
[01:57:04.147 --> 01:57:08.949]  That's different from the people who are in the process business, which is politics.
[01:57:08.949 --> 01:57:18.572]  Politics will no longer supersede the ongoing relationships that we have in terms of moments of truth, what they will call the alternative truth.
[01:57:19.210 --> 01:57:20.310]  I don't know.
[01:57:38.737 --> 01:57:48.959]  Now they're running to the middle to get away from themselves, and these systems are literally making themselves obsolete, and they're trying to bully all us into submission, but only destroying themselves faster.
[01:57:48.959 --> 01:57:50.959]  It's an incredible process.
[01:57:50.959 --> 01:57:57.800]  Well, it was predictable, and that process really had the final punch, which was coronavirus.
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.581]  Was that incidental or coincidental?
[01:58:00.581 --> 01:58:07.682]  I don't have to get into it, but it was not... But they inflict the biggest lockdowns on themselves to control us, only destroying themselves!
[01:58:08.618 --> 01:58:09.198]  Correct.
[01:58:09.198 --> 01:58:10.579]  And that's what happened.
[01:58:10.579 --> 01:58:17.183]  We eventually went into self-destruction, which is the final moment of 9-11, where we self-destruct.
[01:58:17.183 --> 01:58:19.144]  Cutting the nose off to spite the face.
[01:58:19.144 --> 01:58:19.664]  Amazing.
[01:58:19.664 --> 01:58:21.065]  Dr. Steven Chinnick, thank you so much.
[01:58:21.994 --> 01:58:23.675]  Thank you, Alex, and God bless.
[01:58:23.675 --> 01:58:24.195]  God bless you.
[01:58:24.195 --> 01:58:28.177]  We got a big, powerful 9-11 interview, and that's the real deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:28.177 --> 01:58:30.098]  All right, the Hodge brothers are on fire.
[01:58:30.098 --> 01:58:33.219]  They've always been on fire for years, but they're really in fuego now.
[01:58:33.219 --> 01:58:35.840]  We'll be talking to them in 60 seconds.
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.201]  I'm excited.
[01:58:37.201 --> 01:58:38.481]  Tell folks how to tune in right now.
[01:58:38.481 --> 01:58:40.242]  If you're watching or listening, please tune in.
[01:58:40.242 --> 01:58:41.703]  That's how we reach new people.
[01:58:41.703 --> 01:58:43.043]  That's how we override the censors.
[01:58:43.043 --> 01:58:43.544]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.765 --> 01:58:56.148]  As of 54 days out, the globalist, child-molesting, devil-worshippers know they're in trouble and they know Trump's going to win in the landslides.
[01:58:56.148 --> 01:58:59.769]  They're saying they're going to contest the election and plunge the country into civil war.
[01:58:59.769 --> 01:59:04.790]  And they are throwing hack attacks at InfoWars, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down.
[01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:06.131]  It's incredible.
[01:59:06.131 --> 01:59:10.912]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at InfoWarshore.com is critical.
[01:59:10.912 --> 01:59:12.312]  It's what keeps us in the game.
[01:59:12.312 --> 01:59:13.473]  We've only got a few months
[01:59:14.213 --> 01:59:15.094]  A backup.
[01:59:15.094 --> 01:59:18.577]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down and that's not good.
[01:59:18.577 --> 01:59:24.562]  We need to have extra money in our coffers to be able to expand in this homestretch, not just contract.
[01:59:24.562 --> 01:59:25.422]  We're winning.
[01:59:25.422 --> 01:59:29.025]  But these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[01:59:29.025 --> 01:59:30.426]  So I know you're going to step up.
[01:59:30.426 --> 01:59:41.976]  At InfowarsStore.com, we've got free shipping on a bunch of our best-selling items, a bunch of new items that came back in stock, we've got privacy pockets so your phones don't track you, great supplements, books, films, t-shirts, and so much more.
[01:59:41.976 --> 01:59:43.457]  Get prepared and fund the Infowar.
[01:59:43.737 --> 01:59:51.607]  At InfoWarsTore.com, God bless you all.
[01:59:51.607 --> 01:59:52.829]  You found it.
[01:59:52.829 --> 01:59:54.851]  The tip of the spear.
[01:59:54.851 --> 01:59:57.195]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.954 --> 02:00:22.401]  Well, I've been loving these guys for years, but man, are they popular now, and are they exploding.
[02:00:22.401 --> 02:00:25.543]  Millions of views every day, despite the shadow banning.
[02:00:25.543 --> 02:00:35.888]  The Hodge Twins on YouTube, Conservative Twins Instagram, Official Hodge Twins on Twitter, Hodge Twins, and they're here with us live on this Friday edition to cover the waterfront, but
[02:00:37.051 --> 02:00:41.975]  I just learned this a few minutes ago, so I want to get their take on this.
[02:00:41.975 --> 02:00:45.158]  Trump nominated a second time for Nobel Prize, the Hill.
[02:00:45.158 --> 02:00:51.543]  I remember the Swedish Parliament on Friday nominated Trump and the governments of Kosovo and Serbia.
[02:00:52.827 --> 02:00:53.327]  We're good to go.
[02:01:19.488 --> 02:01:21.208]  Many, many years ago before he even got in office.
[02:01:21.208 --> 02:01:25.610]  So gentlemen, thank you for spending time with us and congratulations on your great success.
[02:01:25.610 --> 02:01:26.110]  Oh, thank you.
[02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:26.890]  Thank you for having us.
[02:01:26.890 --> 02:01:29.071]  But yeah, of course he deserves it.
[02:01:29.071 --> 02:01:35.352]  I mean, Trump's done an amazing job since he came into office and they set the bar so low.
[02:01:35.352 --> 02:01:37.613]  Not only did they nominate Obama,
[02:01:38.348 --> 02:01:39.890]  He won the prize?
[02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:40.531]  Yeah.
[02:01:40.531 --> 02:01:42.414]  By doing absolutely nothing.
[02:01:42.414 --> 02:01:43.957]  The deal he broke between the U.A.?
[02:01:43.957 --> 02:01:46.360]  I mean, nobody saw that coming.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:48.924]  He's did an amazing job since he became president.
[02:01:48.924 --> 02:01:51.288]  He's stopping the endless wars around the world?
[02:01:51.288 --> 02:01:51.728]  Yeah.
[02:01:51.728 --> 02:01:53.811]  Of course, he most definitely deserves that.
[02:01:55.077 --> 02:01:57.540]  Well, Democrats and Republicans always say they want to be peacemakers.
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:59.261]  With Trump, it's ridiculous.
[02:01:59.261 --> 02:02:10.033]  North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, and the Balkans, and then now all these other deals.
[02:02:10.033 --> 02:02:10.974]  This is getting crazy.
[02:02:12.830 --> 02:02:18.454]  Yeah, I thought it was amazing when he broke up that relationship with Kim Jong Un.
[02:02:18.454 --> 02:02:19.914]  I think I'm pronouncing his name right?
[02:02:19.914 --> 02:02:21.175]  Yeah, Rocket Man.
[02:02:21.175 --> 02:02:24.237]  Yeah, I started talking to him on Twitter and called him Rocket Man.
[02:02:24.237 --> 02:02:24.858]  Yeah.
[02:02:24.858 --> 02:02:26.619]  And then he goes over to the first U.S.
[02:02:26.619 --> 02:02:28.240]  president to ever do that.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:28.820]  Right.
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:30.121]  I mean, this president
[02:02:30.661 --> 02:02:34.963]  Not only is he a great leader, this man has balls and he's not a politician.
[02:02:34.963 --> 02:02:39.925]  He's showing what a leader of the United States of the free world, what a leader should do.
[02:02:39.925 --> 02:02:40.546]  I totally agree.
[02:02:40.546 --> 02:02:42.727]  Look at the things he's done with the coronavirus, man.
[02:02:42.727 --> 02:02:44.127]  He locked this country down.
[02:02:44.127 --> 02:02:47.929]  He's did things that was unprecedented and nobody's giving him any credit for it.
[02:02:47.929 --> 02:02:52.571]  If he didn't do that, if Hillary was in office as our president, she wouldn't have did any of that.
[02:02:52.571 --> 02:02:53.832]  Well that was my next question.
[02:02:54.212 --> 02:02:54.892]  That was my next question.
[02:02:54.892 --> 02:02:56.913]  In fact, cue up the clip where they call him a liar.
[02:02:56.913 --> 02:02:58.373]  He's in there with the press conference.
[02:02:58.373 --> 02:02:59.814]  He's the one that locked the U.S.
[02:02:59.814 --> 02:03:06.296]  down and blocked the flights from China when Pelosi was going around saying, don't do it, and so was Biden.
[02:03:06.296 --> 02:03:08.317]  And then they were telling Trump 4% are dying.
[02:03:08.317 --> 02:03:09.757]  He goes, well, hell, I better lock it down.
[02:03:09.757 --> 02:03:11.618]  Turned out it wasn't as deadly as they said.
[02:03:11.618 --> 02:03:16.699]  So because he's saying it's deadly six months ago when they were telling him that, and now he says it's not as bad, thank God.
[02:03:16.699 --> 02:03:17.500]  That's not lying.
[02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:18.480]  That's getting new information.
[02:03:19.315 --> 02:03:23.359]  Yeah, and don't forget, they call him xenophobic when he locked down the country.
[02:03:23.359 --> 02:03:27.503]  Yeah, and, uh, what was it, uh, Pelosi said, come on down to Chinatown.
[02:03:27.503 --> 02:03:30.286]  She was down there hugging Chinaman and all that stuff.
[02:03:30.286 --> 02:03:35.091]  Encouraging people to not social distance and to hug people just because they're Asian.
[02:03:35.091 --> 02:03:37.453]  Yeah, because they claim Trump's xenophobic.
[02:03:37.453 --> 02:03:40.216]  I mean, looking back on it, it's just, it's just pure hypocrisy.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.441]  I mean, I think he's done a phenomenal job.
[02:03:42.441 --> 02:03:44.623]  They're blaming everybody but China.
[02:03:44.623 --> 02:03:49.947]  Trump is making America great again, while China, they're making viruses great again.
[02:03:49.947 --> 02:03:57.612]  And don't forget, when Trump did the State of the Union speech, he mentioned coronavirus, aka Chinese virus, and Pelosi ripped up his speech.
[02:03:57.612 --> 02:03:58.193]  Yeah.
[02:03:58.193 --> 02:04:00.635]  I mean, who really loves America and who hates America?
[02:04:00.635 --> 02:04:00.815]  Yeah.
[02:04:02.005 --> 02:04:02.986]  Well, absolutely.
[02:04:02.986 --> 02:04:09.452]  I don't see Americans buying that Trump's a racist or that Trump's behind the virus when there's no evidence.
[02:04:09.452 --> 02:04:10.553]  I see that backfiring.
[02:04:10.553 --> 02:04:12.154]  What are you guys seeing?
[02:04:12.154 --> 02:04:14.636]  Well, there's a lot of idiots in this country.
[02:04:14.636 --> 02:04:17.519]  I mean, look back at this past election.
[02:04:17.519 --> 02:04:19.861]  Hillary actually won the popular vote.
[02:04:19.861 --> 02:04:21.723]  How dumb is this country?
[02:04:21.723 --> 02:04:23.424]  There's a lot of fools out there, Alex.
[02:04:23.424 --> 02:04:25.686]  Hey, Alex, thank God for the Electoral College.
[02:04:26.934 --> 02:04:27.954]  No, I hear you.
[02:04:27.954 --> 02:04:33.315]  And now Hillary says they're going to challenge, she's the boss, the election no matter what.
[02:04:33.315 --> 02:04:36.136]  Now we learn that Mattis had a coup plan against Trump.
[02:04:36.136 --> 02:04:37.736]  This is crazy.
[02:04:37.736 --> 02:04:38.877]  Right, yeah.
[02:04:38.877 --> 02:04:41.497]  And they're trying to steal this election with the mail-in ballots.
[02:04:41.497 --> 02:04:46.638]  I say, hey, if y'all so confident with the mail-in ballots, go ahead and mail in your ballots.
[02:04:46.638 --> 02:04:50.579]  Us conservatives, Republicans, I'm going to show up and I'm going to make my vote personally.
[02:04:50.579 --> 02:04:51.899]  Yeah, because I'm a patriot.
[02:04:51.899 --> 02:04:53.700]  I'm going to make sure my vote is counted.
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:55.260]  Well, Trump made the point that
[02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:59.471]  Just as you just said, that I hope they're not voting twice.
[02:04:59.471 --> 02:05:04.533]  Well, now we know all over the country where they've been doing it, Democrats, it's mainly Democrats.
[02:05:04.533 --> 02:05:05.673]  They don't care about the law.
[02:05:05.673 --> 02:05:09.815]  They're voting via mail and then going in and voting at the polling place.
[02:05:09.815 --> 02:05:11.115]  Right.
[02:05:11.115 --> 02:05:12.195]  That could easily happen.
[02:05:12.195 --> 02:05:15.276]  I mean, that's come out of all the special elections.
[02:05:15.276 --> 02:05:16.697]  Michigan, you name it, it's been happening.
[02:05:17.608 --> 02:05:27.271]  Yeah, I mean, how can you keep track of, I mean, I can keep track of what my left and right hand doing, but you can't keep track of what's going on if you mail in a vote and then you're going in to vote.
[02:05:27.271 --> 02:05:30.953]  I mean, it's just going to open up so much fraud in this next election.
[02:05:30.953 --> 02:05:35.914]  And if there's a lot of mail-in votes, I mean, the election's not going to be determined that night.
[02:05:35.914 --> 02:05:37.355]  It's going to take weeks and months.
[02:05:38.151 --> 02:05:41.413]  Well that was the plan, the Democrats admit by having 80 million mail-ins.
[02:05:41.413 --> 02:05:50.017]  It's going to gum it up and they're just going to challenge it and now the media is working with Zuckerberg and Facebook and Google to say they're not going to let us say we think Trump won.
[02:05:50.017 --> 02:05:53.619]  That is so dangerous.
[02:05:53.619 --> 02:05:54.539]  I can see it coming.
[02:05:54.539 --> 02:05:58.941]  I mean what they said about that that kid Rittenhouse who just self-defense.
[02:05:58.941 --> 02:05:59.982]  Anybody that talks about that
[02:06:00.518 --> 02:06:01.718]  The video goes down.
[02:06:01.718 --> 02:06:05.219]  But you call him a mass murderer, it goes viral on Facebook.
[02:06:05.219 --> 02:06:06.340]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:07.500]  Well, that's what Facebook said.
[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:12.321]  They said last week, as you know, they said, we've determined he's a mass murderer.
[02:06:12.321 --> 02:06:13.341]  So did Twitter.
[02:06:13.341 --> 02:06:15.622]  So his lawyer can't speak for him.
[02:06:15.622 --> 02:06:17.022]  They're blocking his lawyer.
[02:06:17.022 --> 02:06:19.123]  So now even your lawyer doesn't have speech.
[02:06:19.123 --> 02:06:21.224]  That violates the Constitution.
[02:06:21.224 --> 02:06:21.484]  Oh, yeah.
[02:06:21.484 --> 02:06:25.825]  And don't forget, there's a video of Gavin Newsom out of California.
[02:06:25.825 --> 02:06:29.706]  He's got a video up on Facebook clearly stating that Trump called
[02:06:30.251 --> 02:06:33.714]  Mexicans and immigrants, um, what's the term you call it?
[02:06:33.714 --> 02:06:34.414]  Rapists.
[02:06:34.414 --> 02:06:35.515]  Rapists and murderers.
[02:06:35.515 --> 02:06:42.441]  When they know good and well there was a doctored video where they took it out of context and he was referring to MS-13 gang.
[02:06:42.441 --> 02:06:43.862]  Nobody fact check that video.
[02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:47.945]  That video is still up with millions of views.
[02:06:47.945 --> 02:06:54.430]  Guys, I could ask a thousand questions and I've got a thousand questions, but what's front and center for you guys to win this election and save the country?
[02:06:55.575 --> 02:06:58.237]  Man, I guess we cannot become complacent.
[02:06:58.237 --> 02:07:03.462]  I mean, if you're physically fit, go out and vote.
[02:07:03.462 --> 02:07:09.927]  If you have any pre-existing issues and you don't feel safe going out and voting, take precautions.
[02:07:09.927 --> 02:07:11.628]  But this election is so important.
[02:07:11.628 --> 02:07:12.229]  These people
[02:07:13.129 --> 02:07:17.255]  People are sitting back saying that, you know, it doesn't matter who's an officer.
[02:07:17.255 --> 02:07:20.980]  No, you've got grown folks deciding on how you and your kids are going to live.
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:22.422]  Don't be a child.
[02:07:22.422 --> 02:07:23.183]  Make a decision.
[02:07:23.183 --> 02:07:28.930]  Make sure you show up and vote, especially if you are... Well, communism is a lot more dangerous than the coronavirus, and I agree.
[02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:30.192]  People better knock on doors.
[02:07:31.033 --> 02:07:35.175]  And they better get, because they know conservatives will tend to follow directives if we're trying to work together.
[02:07:35.175 --> 02:07:36.635]  And they know liberals will violate rules.
[02:07:36.635 --> 02:07:39.116]  That's why they're doing the lockdown to keep us from voting.
[02:07:39.116 --> 02:07:40.097]  Don't just go vote.
[02:07:40.097 --> 02:07:41.757]  Bring everybody with you.
[02:07:41.757 --> 02:07:43.598]  Get them registered now.
[02:07:43.598 --> 02:07:44.418]  How many days left?
[02:07:44.418 --> 02:07:47.039]  Only a few days left in most areas to get registered.
[02:07:47.039 --> 02:07:47.940]  Yeah.
[02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:49.660]  My whole entire family is registered.
[02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:50.441]  I'm ready.
[02:07:50.441 --> 02:07:51.121]  I'm ready.
[02:07:51.121 --> 02:07:52.842]  I'm ready to rock and roll.
[02:07:52.842 --> 02:07:54.142]  This is D-Day for me.
[02:07:54.142 --> 02:07:55.463]  Yeah.
[02:07:55.463 --> 02:07:56.403]  World War III.
[02:07:56.403 --> 02:07:57.663]  Let me ask you both that question.
[02:07:57.663 --> 02:07:59.004]  What is Trump going to do if he gets re-elected?
[02:08:00.638 --> 02:08:02.039]  I think he did an amazing job.
[02:08:02.039 --> 02:08:07.841]  I think he just continued to keep his pace, continue to beat Donald Trump and do what he's been doing for the past four years.
[02:08:07.841 --> 02:08:08.942]  He's putting America first.
[02:08:08.942 --> 02:08:14.825]  And I think if hopefully he does get re-elected, I think then he's not going to have to worry about being re-elected.
[02:08:14.825 --> 02:08:17.906]  He's going to really show what a leader should be doing.
[02:08:17.906 --> 02:08:18.246]  No, I agree.
[02:08:18.246 --> 02:08:19.587]  He's going to stop these protests.
[02:08:19.587 --> 02:08:19.827]  Yeah.
[02:08:19.827 --> 02:08:20.608]  I hope he wins.
[02:08:20.608 --> 02:08:21.468]  He just has to be himself.
[02:08:21.468 --> 02:08:23.149]  That's why everybody gravitates towards him.
[02:08:24.184 --> 02:08:28.566]  I hope he wins this one, but I'm already worrying about four years from now.
[02:08:28.566 --> 02:08:33.169]  I'm like, what happens when he's like 80 years old?
[02:08:33.169 --> 02:08:39.852]  I mean, hopefully this is the foundation, this conservatives on the right needs, and we'll just use it as a stepping stone.
[02:08:39.852 --> 02:08:40.353]  Exactly.
[02:08:40.353 --> 02:08:46.396]  He takes over, we take over the Republican Party, and it's now an Americana 1776 Trump deal.
[02:08:46.396 --> 02:08:47.196]  There you go.
[02:08:47.196 --> 02:08:48.057]  There you go.
[02:08:48.057 --> 02:08:50.198]  You just put chills on my spine now.
[02:08:50.198 --> 02:08:52.239]  And we put the Hodge brothers both in the U.S.
[02:08:52.239 --> 02:08:52.539]  Senate.
[02:08:54.038 --> 02:08:55.139]  There you go.
[02:08:55.139 --> 02:08:55.800]  And then the presidency.
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:58.181]  Hey, I'm running for governor!
[02:08:58.181 --> 02:09:03.044]  And then whichever one of you guys is elected president later, the other guy can body double for him.
[02:09:03.044 --> 02:09:08.628]  I tell you what, if I ever ran for any kind of office, I'm telling you, all kinds of stuff is coming out.
[02:09:08.628 --> 02:09:10.009]  I see what they did to Trump.
[02:09:10.009 --> 02:09:14.212]  Can you imagine what they're going to do to my black ass?
[02:09:14.212 --> 02:09:17.254]  Believe me, the stuff they said about me almost... That's not true.
[02:09:17.254 --> 02:09:18.535]  Yeah, none of it's true.
[02:09:18.535 --> 02:09:20.056]  Nothing they said about me is true yet.
[02:09:20.056 --> 02:09:21.577]  Thank God they hadn't found out about the real stuff.
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:27.842]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[02:09:27.842 --> 02:09:30.344]  This is taken under the tongue
[02:09:52.671 --> 02:09:54.854]  It is pure turmeric.
[02:09:54.854 --> 02:10:04.065]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[02:10:04.065 --> 02:10:09.912]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[02:10:09.912 --> 02:10:12.075]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[02:10:12.515 --> 02:10:15.736]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[02:10:15.736 --> 02:10:17.577]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[02:10:17.577 --> 02:10:19.698]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[02:10:19.698 --> 02:10:21.879]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[02:10:21.879 --> 02:10:23.239]  Some like bodies better.
[02:10:23.239 --> 02:10:26.381]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action.
[02:10:26.381 --> 02:10:27.381]  It's so much more.
[02:10:27.381 --> 02:10:28.581]  And they fund the InfoWare.

[02:10:46.089 --> 02:10:59.932]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[02:10:59.932 --> 02:11:05.273]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[02:11:05.273 --> 02:11:05.973]  But it's true.
[02:11:05.973 --> 02:11:09.374]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[02:11:10.134 --> 02:11:12.596]  That is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[02:11:12.596 --> 02:11:14.677]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[02:11:14.677 --> 02:11:16.438]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[02:11:16.438 --> 02:11:17.299]  And we're still here.
[02:11:17.299 --> 02:11:21.742]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[02:11:21.742 --> 02:11:23.363]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[02:11:23.363 --> 02:11:25.504]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[02:11:25.504 --> 02:11:29.287]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[02:11:29.887 --> 02:11:31.167]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:12:05.182 --> 02:12:12.650]  You know, the level of brainwashing and censorship going on by big tech has gotten crazier.
[02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:13.531]  They censor the president.
[02:12:13.531 --> 02:12:14.312]  They censor everybody.
[02:12:14.312 --> 02:12:17.275]  They've, I know, been censoring the Hodge twins some.
[02:12:17.275 --> 02:12:18.156]  But they even have...
[02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:20.750]  We're good to go.
[02:12:41.451 --> 02:12:46.172]  Saying it's a fake photo that she looks like Marilyn Monroe, but then that's a real photo of her.
[02:12:46.172 --> 02:12:54.934]  So, now we can't even say, why do these health directors look like they've been smoking boatloads of crack or drinking Drano or something.
[02:12:54.934 --> 02:13:00.575]  I mean, that level of us not even being able to objectively say that, to me is just crazy.
[02:13:00.575 --> 02:13:02.456]  What do you guys think of that?
[02:13:02.456 --> 02:13:04.996]  I mean, definitely something.
[02:13:04.996 --> 02:13:05.596]  Aye.
[02:13:05.596 --> 02:13:06.477]  Yeah, she needs a...
[02:13:11.269 --> 02:13:12.250]  Absolutely, guys.
[02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:13.871]  We got the Hodge twins with us.
[02:13:13.871 --> 02:13:30.724]  One of you guys, I think your mics might be still muted, but speaking of gaslighting people, telling people that we can't believe our eyes, Nadler says that there is no such thing as Antifa burning down these cities and shooting everybody and doing this.
[02:13:30.724 --> 02:13:31.825]  So I wanted to ask what you thought of him.
[02:13:31.825 --> 02:13:33.386]  Here he is.
[02:13:33.386 --> 02:13:33.847]  It is true.
[02:13:33.847 --> 02:13:34.927]  There's violence across the whole country.
[02:13:34.927 --> 02:13:36.229]  Do you disavow the violence from Antifa?
[02:13:37.336 --> 02:13:38.936]  That's happening in Portland right now?
[02:13:38.936 --> 02:13:43.158]  That's a myth that's being spread only in Washington, D.C.
[02:13:43.158 --> 02:13:44.438]  About Antifa in Portland?
[02:13:44.438 --> 02:13:44.938]  Yes.
[02:13:44.938 --> 02:13:46.719]  Sure, there's videos everywhere online.
[02:13:46.719 --> 02:13:48.159]  There's fires and riots.
[02:13:48.159 --> 02:13:52.140]  So gentlemen, we forget that they're saying things like that.
[02:13:52.140 --> 02:13:54.181]  What do you make of that?
[02:13:54.181 --> 02:13:59.522]  I mean, why would anybody listen to a guy that pulls his pants right up on his nipples and he walks like that?
[02:13:59.522 --> 02:14:04.143]  I mean, he's gotta be
[02:14:09.022 --> 02:14:09.802]  Alright, listen.
[02:14:09.802 --> 02:14:15.586]  Guys, you guys are great, but the Hodge twin in blue, because I get twins mixed up, I think your mic is muted.
[02:14:15.586 --> 02:14:17.607]  It's not coming through.
[02:14:17.607 --> 02:14:18.888]  So slap it a couple times.
[02:14:18.888 --> 02:14:21.009]  It's just like when my mic doesn't work.
[02:14:21.009 --> 02:14:22.350]  Is it working now?
[02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:23.030]  You hear me now?
[02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.651]  Yes, sir!
[02:14:23.651 --> 02:14:24.431]  Sorry, start again.
[02:14:24.431 --> 02:14:26.592]  It actually just piqued my interest.
[02:14:26.592 --> 02:14:27.793]  Tell me.
[02:14:27.793 --> 02:14:33.517]  Yeah, I'm thinking anybody who pulls his pants up around his nipples that high, you can't listen to him about anything.
[02:14:33.517 --> 02:14:35.298]  He loses all credibility.
[02:14:35.298 --> 02:14:35.818]  Yeah, and
[02:14:36.747 --> 02:14:46.357]  To say that Antifa or these rides is false I mean everybody has two eyes even Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder can see that.
[02:14:46.357 --> 02:14:58.689]  Yeah I mean I've said this many times anybody that's on the left they're not very bright because if you look at both sides you wouldn't be on the left.
[02:14:58.689 --> 02:14:59.169]  Yeah.
[02:14:59.169 --> 02:14:59.570]  It's like
[02:15:00.962 --> 02:15:06.404]  It's got, these people are like brain dead to believe that Antifa does not exist.
[02:15:06.404 --> 02:15:07.924]  Yeah, or these riots did not happen.
[02:15:07.924 --> 02:15:13.486]  I mean, you have to be mentally, intellectually weak not to be able to think for yourself and take this man for his word.
[02:15:13.486 --> 02:15:15.167]  Yeah, and that's the constituents on the left.
[02:15:15.167 --> 02:15:16.787]  They are intellectually weak.
[02:15:16.787 --> 02:15:17.367]  They're sheep.
[02:15:17.367 --> 02:15:20.268]  They just go by whatever the TV tells them to do.
[02:15:20.268 --> 02:15:24.810]  And that's why they have these people because mainstream media is all over every channel.
[02:15:24.810 --> 02:15:28.471]  They have the upper hand and these people fall prey to them.
[02:15:28.471 --> 02:15:28.611]  Yeah.
[02:15:29.633 --> 02:15:31.835]  Well, I'm going to tell you something right now, and you're not a sponsor.
[02:15:31.835 --> 02:15:33.377]  I'm saying this because I believe it.
[02:15:33.377 --> 02:15:36.920]  I'm going to get a blue shirt and a red shirt and one of those hats.
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:39.142]  Because they look great and I love what you're doing.
[02:15:39.142 --> 02:15:41.645]  How do I get one of these awesome Hodge twins shirts or hats?
[02:15:43.112 --> 02:15:46.433]  Our website is official, hawkstwins.com.
[02:15:46.433 --> 02:15:47.793]  We even throw in a sale, Alex.
[02:15:47.793 --> 02:15:49.414]  You get 20% off.
[02:15:49.414 --> 02:15:53.215]  Just use discount code CHINESEVIRUS.
[02:15:53.215 --> 02:15:55.036]  Are you serious?
[02:15:55.036 --> 02:15:56.176]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:56.176 --> 02:15:58.637]  We call it Chinese because it comes from China.
[02:15:58.637 --> 02:16:01.198]  We make your t-shirts great again.
[02:16:01.198 --> 02:16:02.178]  Well, let me throw this in there.
[02:16:02.178 --> 02:16:07.320]  If you read back the Clinton Foundation, not the new foundation, their original foundation that became the library.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:20.472]  World Net Daily sued and got documents and it said in there back in like 1993 when they got elected they said, we can't let conservatives ever have merchandise or books or films of their own culture because it's more popular.
[02:16:20.472 --> 02:16:23.715]  We've got to bankrupt anybody tries to fund themselves.
[02:16:23.715 --> 02:16:30.361]  And so that's why you guys being successful and you guys making great stuff and you guys getting bigger is all of us getting bigger.
[02:16:30.361 --> 02:16:31.483]  So I just love what you're doing.
[02:16:31.483 --> 02:16:32.684]  How do folks find everything you're doing?
[02:16:33.939 --> 02:16:42.284]  Well, they can follow us on Facebook at The Hosh Twins, Instagram, Official Hosh Twins, Twitter, Hosh Twins, and on YouTube, Conservative Twins.
[02:16:42.284 --> 02:16:42.684]  Yeah.
[02:16:42.684 --> 02:16:48.548]  Well, you guys have been blowing up for a while, but at your growth rate right now, you'll be bigger than Joe Rogan in six months.
[02:16:48.548 --> 02:16:51.649]  Yeah, I wish Joe Rogan let me come on his show.
[02:16:51.649 --> 02:16:54.051]  Well, he lives down the street now, but I'm not going to have to go talk to him.
[02:16:54.051 --> 02:16:55.232]  Yeah, I hear you.
[02:16:55.232 --> 02:16:56.452]  Yeah.
[02:16:56.452 --> 02:16:58.914]  Yeah, he moved to Texas and got the hell out of that damn California.
[02:17:00.377 --> 02:17:01.478]  Got the hell out of there.
[02:17:01.478 --> 02:17:04.541]  He probably started adding up how much taxes he's paying every month to his state.
[02:17:04.541 --> 02:17:05.262]  He said, you know what?
[02:17:05.262 --> 02:17:06.523]  This is not freedom.
[02:17:06.523 --> 02:17:07.724]  I'm going to Texas.
[02:17:07.724 --> 02:17:08.845]  Took him long enough.
[02:17:08.845 --> 02:17:10.226]  You know, he should have you guys on.
[02:17:10.226 --> 02:17:11.367]  Yeah.
[02:17:11.367 --> 02:17:13.529]  Well, I just love having you here.
[02:17:13.529 --> 02:17:16.031]  Now, I could ask a lot of questions, but let me get into this.
[02:17:16.031 --> 02:17:21.196]  I'm sure you saw Kaitlyn Bennett at Central Florida University in Orlando.
[02:17:21.196 --> 02:17:25.240]  Just like Rittenhouse is being chased down, but they chased her down and began to attack her bodyguards.
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:26.261]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:33.409]  Yeah, it's just people on the left, man, it came to a point that they don't want to debate.
[02:17:33.409 --> 02:17:34.670]  They don't have a discussion.
[02:17:34.670 --> 02:17:36.391]  It's either my way or the highway.
[02:17:36.391 --> 02:17:40.193]  And that's pretty sad because we both need people on the left and the right.
[02:17:40.193 --> 02:17:48.297]  I mean, we're never going to agree on everything, but at this point in time in society, nobody wants to listen on the left or take any criticism.
[02:17:48.297 --> 02:17:49.698]  Hey Alex, you know what's crazy?
[02:17:50.339 --> 02:17:55.822]  The Democrats, back in the 50s and 60s, you know the segregation and Jim Crow laws attacking people?
[02:17:55.822 --> 02:17:56.243]  Yeah.
[02:17:56.243 --> 02:18:01.146]  It's crazy as hell now that they're doing it in 2020 against this conservative.
[02:18:01.146 --> 02:18:02.907]  Yeah, or anybody that thinks different from him.
[02:18:02.907 --> 02:18:04.428]  They're doing the exact same tactics.
[02:18:04.428 --> 02:18:05.828]  It's the exact same thing.
[02:18:05.828 --> 02:18:14.954]  Like, I've seen Black Lives Matter, and there's white people walking with them in unison supporting Black Lives Matter, and then these black people go up to, like,
[02:18:15.845 --> 02:18:20.648]  Elderly white people just sitting eating at a restaurant, attacking them, eating their food off the plate.
[02:18:20.648 --> 02:18:22.328]  This is what happened.
[02:18:22.328 --> 02:18:25.010]  That's why Martin Luther King was so important.
[02:18:25.010 --> 02:18:27.491]  And now here we are in 2020.
[02:18:27.491 --> 02:18:29.512]  Democrats are doing the exact same thing.
[02:18:29.512 --> 02:18:32.074]  And it still amazes me that they're pushing this.
[02:18:32.074 --> 02:18:38.297]  I mean, anybody with two eyes and a brain, you should be able to look up for yourself on Google and clearly see
[02:18:38.837 --> 02:18:44.061]  That the statistics do not support police officers hunting down black men like animals.
[02:18:44.061 --> 02:18:49.766]  You're more likely, a police officer, a white police officer is way more likely to die to a black dude.
[02:18:49.766 --> 02:18:50.527]  Yeah.
[02:18:50.527 --> 02:18:52.568]  In almost 1801.
[02:18:52.568 --> 02:19:02.056]  But statistically speaking, black men are being hunted down by black men and they refuse to acknowledge that fact.
[02:19:02.056 --> 02:19:03.017]  So where does it go?
[02:19:03.017 --> 02:19:03.657]  Where does it end?
[02:19:03.657 --> 02:19:06.099]  What happens if Trump... I agree.
[02:19:06.099 --> 02:19:07.681]  God forbid, what happens if Trump loses?
[02:19:09.713 --> 02:19:13.395]  All of us are just going to have to remain strong and keep spreading our voice and keep fighting.
[02:19:13.395 --> 02:19:15.036]  That's all we can do.
[02:19:15.036 --> 02:19:18.618]  I'm definitely not going to give up like a liberal.
[02:19:18.618 --> 02:19:19.818]  Just keep fighting, Alex.
[02:19:19.818 --> 02:19:20.619]  Just keep fighting.
[02:19:20.619 --> 02:19:22.299]  We're going to keep doing what we're doing.
[02:19:22.299 --> 02:19:23.820]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:25.581]  All those pictures, we're just going to fight together.
[02:19:25.581 --> 02:19:26.281]  And you know what, Alex?
[02:19:26.281 --> 02:19:29.623]  Sometimes you've got to take two steps back before you can take two steps forward.
[02:19:29.623 --> 02:19:33.845]  If that should happen, I'm not going to stop putting out... No, no, I totally agree.
[02:19:33.845 --> 02:19:38.267]  In a sick way, I don't want Trump to lose, but if they did, it'll be so bad on the left.
[02:19:40.057 --> 02:19:44.363]  I mean, it'll definitely be over if we survive.
[02:19:44.363 --> 02:19:46.706]  Yeah, I mean we're facing Facebook censorship.
[02:19:46.706 --> 02:19:51.412]  Our Facebook page is facing being unpublished because they say what we're saying is hate speech.
[02:19:53.587 --> 02:19:56.389]  I mean, hate speech is, I mean, it's crazy.
[02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:59.411]  Just because you hate hearing it doesn't make it hate speech.
[02:19:59.411 --> 02:20:00.411]  Yes.
[02:20:00.411 --> 02:20:08.436]  Well, I watch you guys every day, and so does my son, and you guys are very well-spoken and very friendly and very jovial and very positive, but that's why they don't like you.
[02:20:08.436 --> 02:20:10.037]  Because the truth is, it's not hate.
[02:20:10.037 --> 02:20:11.818]  It's popular and it's true.
[02:20:11.818 --> 02:20:17.301]  They don't like what's true, they don't like what's popular, because they're selling global tyranny.
[02:20:17.301 --> 02:20:18.722]  The Hodge twins are our guest.
[02:20:18.722 --> 02:20:19.403]  I want to come back.
[02:20:20.290 --> 02:20:24.172]  And play some clips for them and get their take on what they think Trump ought to do.
[02:20:24.172 --> 02:20:26.153]  Because Trump does listen to them, I can tell you.
[02:20:26.153 --> 02:20:26.853]  Trump listens to us.
[02:20:26.853 --> 02:20:28.114]  He listens to all of us.
[02:20:28.114 --> 02:20:34.357]  What do we want to see Trump do next with 52 days out to really get on the offense and ensure this win?
[02:20:34.357 --> 02:20:37.459]  Because this race is close because of election fraud.
[02:20:37.459 --> 02:20:38.720]  We'll be right back with the Hodge twins.
[02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:40.521]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.
[02:20:43.777 --> 02:20:57.450]  It sounds over the top when I go on air, and I explain that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population, except for a few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods.
[02:20:57.450 --> 02:20:59.832]  But that's really what they're now externalizing.
[02:20:59.832 --> 02:21:05.678]  They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago, and actually openly announcing it everywhere.
[02:21:06.138 --> 02:21:08.659]  They're going from beta to operational.
[02:21:08.659 --> 02:21:10.320]  And think about all these major corporations.
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:11.681]  They tell you humans are harmful.
[02:21:11.681 --> 02:21:13.022]  They tell you humans are a parasite.
[02:21:13.022 --> 02:21:15.123]  They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of.
[02:21:15.123 --> 02:21:20.206]  And then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[02:21:20.206 --> 02:21:23.908]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations.
[02:21:23.908 --> 02:21:31.352]  And everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[02:21:31.772 --> 02:21:38.923]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics that are absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19.
[02:21:38.923 --> 02:21:41.707]  This is all absolute information control.
[02:21:41.707 --> 02:21:42.449]  This is beyond 1984.
[02:21:44.554 --> 02:21:47.976]  I don't want to be right about this prediction.
[02:21:47.976 --> 02:21:50.637]  In fact, it's not a prediction.
[02:21:50.637 --> 02:21:52.878]  It is a forecast.
[02:21:52.878 --> 02:22:11.567]  If we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure of productivity, it will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built.
[02:22:11.567 --> 02:22:13.988]  It will annihilate the funding of that and put
[02:22:14.488 --> 02:22:18.511]  The entire first world in even deeper debt, which we're being maneuvered into.
[02:22:18.511 --> 02:22:29.958]  So I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute the people that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID con game.
[02:22:29.958 --> 02:22:31.739]  This really is a big power grab.
[02:22:31.739 --> 02:22:40.164]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting storable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of their game is to make us dependent on them.
[02:22:40.164 --> 02:22:42.466]  So get self-sufficient now in full wars.com.
[02:22:44.099 --> 02:22:49.983]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening, and I point out that the globalists are a eugenics death cult because it's true.
[02:22:49.983 --> 02:22:51.784]  I don't say it to scare you.
[02:22:51.784 --> 02:22:54.306]  A lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[02:22:54.306 --> 02:22:58.048]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[02:22:58.048 --> 02:23:05.794]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[02:23:05.794 --> 02:23:11.737]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan.
[02:23:11.737 --> 02:23:13.899]  And more and more are being honest about it.
[02:23:14.619 --> 02:23:21.281]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[02:23:21.281 --> 02:23:24.161]  So we're at the point of the emergence now.
[02:23:24.161 --> 02:23:26.042]  And it's coming out in the open.
[02:23:26.042 --> 02:23:31.403]  And some people, under mass Stockholm Syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny.
[02:23:31.403 --> 02:23:33.364]  But others are going to fight.
[02:23:33.364 --> 02:23:38.345]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay.
[02:23:38.345 --> 02:23:38.865]  No.
[02:23:38.865 --> 02:23:41.846]  This thing is post-human exterminism.
[02:23:41.846 --> 02:23:42.686]  Research what that is.
[02:23:47.156 --> 02:23:49.758]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:24:22.008 --> 02:24:25.250]  Well, the Hodge twins are here!
[02:24:25.250 --> 02:24:28.712]  They're getting into how they're starting to be censored by Facebook and their platforms.
[02:24:28.712 --> 02:24:29.532]  Election meddling.
[02:24:29.532 --> 02:24:33.155]  Gentlemen, I got a hundred questions and then a hundred more.
[02:24:33.155 --> 02:24:33.315]  But
[02:24:34.189 --> 02:24:37.610]  With all that's going on in the world, you hit on something.
[02:24:37.610 --> 02:24:43.351]  I know you don't take pleasure in it, and neither do I. The liberals I used to know were anti-offensive war.
[02:24:43.351 --> 02:24:45.311]  Well, Trump's getting us out of all these wars.
[02:24:45.311 --> 02:24:48.032]  The liberals I used to know wanted to empower the average people.
[02:24:48.032 --> 02:24:49.492]  Well, Trump's trying to do that.
[02:24:49.492 --> 02:24:53.473]  The new liberal is not the liberal I knew 30 years ago, 20 years ago.
[02:24:53.473 --> 02:24:57.834]  They're like a crazed demon that's super stupid.
[02:24:57.834 --> 02:25:00.534]  So you were making that point about how weird they are.
[02:25:00.534 --> 02:25:03.835]  What do you think happened to America, or what happened to these people?
[02:25:05.755 --> 02:25:10.621]  They're leftist now, but you know what shifted everything?
[02:25:10.621 --> 02:25:17.129]  Was when politicians and the mainstream media got on TV and called our president a white supremacist.
[02:25:17.129 --> 02:25:17.329]  Yeah.
[02:25:18.215 --> 02:25:21.336]  That the red hat was the new KKK hood.
[02:25:21.336 --> 02:25:24.177]  That's very powerful for somebody to see and hear.
[02:25:24.177 --> 02:25:24.677]  That's right.
[02:25:24.677 --> 02:25:24.957]  That's it.
[02:25:24.957 --> 02:25:31.298]  Because when they see people on the news, they say, this person is somebody of power.
[02:25:31.298 --> 02:25:32.199]  I should listen to him.
[02:25:32.199 --> 02:25:32.879]  He's on TV.
[02:25:32.879 --> 02:25:33.839]  He's in a suit.
[02:25:33.839 --> 02:25:35.439]  So they take their word for it.
[02:25:35.439 --> 02:25:37.720]  And they don't realize that they're being lied to.
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:40.301]  That's why the liberals are no longer liberals.
[02:25:40.301 --> 02:25:40.761]  They're leftists.
[02:25:42.785 --> 02:25:49.070]  How irresponsible for another politician, a member of our government, that's supposed to be working in tandem as a team.
[02:25:49.070 --> 02:25:50.352]  Yeah.
[02:25:50.352 --> 02:25:51.793]  How can yet person...
[02:25:52.606 --> 02:26:08.056]  After the oaths they've taken, stand there on TV and call a man a racist when he's your boss, when y'all should be working together, when you have absolutely no proof that this man is a racist, and say those things on TV, and they say Trump is the bad guy.
[02:26:08.056 --> 02:26:09.457]  He's the provocateur.
[02:26:09.457 --> 02:26:10.097]  Yeah.
[02:26:10.097 --> 02:26:14.960]  This man's been in the public eye for decades, and you can't find anything on his back.
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:20.904]  He bought up all the golf courses that, hard to believe, didn't allow black people and Jews on them, and he opened it up.
[02:26:20.904 --> 02:26:21.925]  He did the opposite.
[02:26:22.731 --> 02:26:26.894]  He's got wards from Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton for helping black folks.
[02:26:26.894 --> 02:26:28.695]  But overnight, he's running for president.
[02:26:28.695 --> 02:26:30.296]  Now he's a white supremacist.
[02:26:30.296 --> 02:26:32.658]  Not only that, he's a Nazi.
[02:26:32.658 --> 02:26:37.221]  But I asked that question because I really didn't know the answer, and you guys just spelled it out.
[02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:46.867]  It's the leadership, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Michael Moore, Bill Clinton, all of them, Obama, saying Trump is a white supremacist.
[02:26:46.867 --> 02:26:50.590]  Well, people then believe the authority figure and believe this is a Nazi.
[02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:52.271]  So she says, if you see him, go after him.
[02:26:52.951 --> 02:26:59.236]  Well, now that's what's happening, and so you're right, it's the leadership of the Democrats that are commanding this and doing it all.
[02:26:59.236 --> 02:27:02.999]  Yeah, Maxine Waters, she said it herself, get in their face.
[02:27:02.999 --> 02:27:05.461]  They come to your restaurant, throw them out.
[02:27:05.461 --> 02:27:06.822]  Let them know you know they're there.
[02:27:06.822 --> 02:27:11.686]  I mean, this all started from the left, but every day when you turn on mainstream media,
[02:27:12.711 --> 02:27:14.172]  Everything's Trump's fault.
[02:27:14.172 --> 02:27:14.793]  Yeah.
[02:27:14.793 --> 02:27:15.773]  Everything.
[02:27:15.773 --> 02:27:25.321]  The coronavirus, the Chinese virus, the riots, the people, the the the the rates rising and murders in our inner cities and all the crime that's being committed.
[02:27:25.321 --> 02:27:27.963]  It's Trump's fault when everybody that's committing those crimes
[02:27:28.343 --> 02:27:30.303]  Well, that's the thing for me.
[02:27:30.303 --> 02:27:32.304]  I don't even like defending somebody as much as I defend Trump.
[02:27:32.304 --> 02:27:34.724]  It feels weird, but he just keeps telling the truth.
[02:27:34.724 --> 02:27:35.264]  I know the facts.
[02:27:57.389 --> 02:28:02.094]  The guy's super truthful, he's got incredible energy, and they keep lying about him.
[02:28:02.094 --> 02:28:05.798]  So I find myself just totally rooting for him and really freaked out.
[02:28:05.798 --> 02:28:10.884]  I saw him almost start crying yesterday in Michigan when everybody was saying, we love you, we love you.
[02:28:10.884 --> 02:28:12.546]  You know, he needs that support.
[02:28:12.546 --> 02:28:16.931]  Could you imagine being 74 and surrounded by all these people and what this is like?
[02:28:16.931 --> 02:28:18.513]  I mean, my God, we need to pray for President Trump.
[02:28:19.465 --> 02:28:27.831]  Yeah, I mean, to be under attack every day on TV, Twitter, he's traveling all over the world to keep this movement going.
[02:28:27.831 --> 02:28:31.433]  And the snakes inside the White House that are backstabbing?
[02:28:31.433 --> 02:28:36.357]  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy what this man's going through, and he's still standing tall for us all.
[02:28:36.357 --> 02:28:43.242]  And he's going to his rallies, and the man is so sharp, and then you look at Joe Biden, it's like night and day.
[02:28:45.122 --> 02:28:50.130]  It's amazing how Joe Biden has the support he does.
[02:28:50.130 --> 02:28:51.232]  That's my next question.
[02:28:51.232 --> 02:28:52.814]  What were they thinking with Joe Biden?
[02:28:52.814 --> 02:28:55.198]  I mean, he is degenerating quickly.
[02:28:56.533 --> 02:28:57.374]  Yeah.
[02:28:57.374 --> 02:28:58.374]  That's the thing, man.
[02:28:58.374 --> 02:28:59.535]  They ain't thinking.
[02:28:59.535 --> 02:29:02.697]  I mean, it's like the liberals lost their mind.
[02:29:02.697 --> 02:29:07.440]  It's just, they think the only way they can beat Trump is Joe Biden, which is pretty sad.
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:08.961]  Let me use this analogy.
[02:29:08.961 --> 02:29:15.064]  It's like putting Mike Tyson in 1988 in the ring with a guy in a wheelchair.
[02:29:15.064 --> 02:29:22.049]  I mean, this is like, mentally, Trump's like Mike Tyson in his prime, and Biden's like an 80-year-old man who doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[02:29:22.930 --> 02:29:24.551]  Yeah, that's putting it nice, Alex.
[02:29:24.551 --> 02:29:25.071]  Yeah.
[02:29:25.071 --> 02:29:28.413]  And he chooses his VP as somebody nobody likes.
[02:29:28.413 --> 02:29:29.914]  Not even black people like her.
[02:29:29.914 --> 02:29:30.755]  Yeah.
[02:29:30.755 --> 02:29:33.736]  I was about to say, she pulled the lowest with black people.
[02:29:33.736 --> 02:29:38.539]  Why the hell did they pick her?
[02:29:38.539 --> 02:29:41.421]  The modern liberal Alex does not think.
[02:29:41.421 --> 02:29:44.503]  Yeah, they only picked her because she supposedly is black.
[02:29:44.503 --> 02:29:45.804]  She's not black.
[02:29:45.804 --> 02:29:48.285]  She's Indian, but she is not black.
[02:29:48.285 --> 02:29:50.326]  She bought as black as Sean Kean, Alex.
[02:29:52.256 --> 02:29:53.397]  I was going to ask that.
[02:29:53.397 --> 02:30:03.765]  What is up with Sean King and Denzel, all these weirdos that obviously have not black, and they say they are, and it comes out that they're not, and they go, well, I identify as that.
[02:30:03.765 --> 02:30:05.727]  I guess it's like men identifying as women or whatever.
[02:30:06.775 --> 02:30:07.075]  Yeah.
[02:30:07.075 --> 02:30:07.695]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:30:07.695 --> 02:30:10.436]  And Trevor Noah brought that up on this podcast.
[02:30:10.436 --> 02:30:13.378]  He said it's okay for a child to pick his gender.
[02:30:13.378 --> 02:30:13.918]  Yeah.
[02:30:13.918 --> 02:30:16.339]  But it's not okay for somebody to pick their race.
[02:30:16.339 --> 02:30:16.719]  Yeah.
[02:30:16.719 --> 02:30:20.360]  A grown adult identifying as another race, that's a lie.
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:24.102]  But a child at six, seven years old can pick their own gender.
[02:30:24.102 --> 02:30:24.922]  That's not a lie.
[02:30:25.522 --> 02:30:30.265]  I mean, everybody in Hollywood, celebrities, football players, they do not think.
[02:30:30.265 --> 02:30:36.729]  And the only reason why these people are on your TV is because some leftists, they're pushing their agenda.
[02:30:36.729 --> 02:30:40.251]  Yeah, you can't pick your gender, you can't pick your race.
[02:30:40.251 --> 02:30:40.632]  Yeah.
[02:30:40.632 --> 02:30:44.774]  If you can pick your gender, I would say you could pick your race if you wanted to.
[02:30:44.774 --> 02:30:45.094]  Yeah.
[02:30:45.094 --> 02:30:48.116]  But at the end of the day, you can't pick your gender and you can't pick your race.
[02:30:48.116 --> 02:30:50.798]  And I'm like thinking, Alex, who is making these rules?
[02:30:51.949 --> 02:30:59.792]  Some satanic worshiping leftists in Hollywood, some elite, is putting, making all these stupid, ridiculous rules.
[02:30:59.792 --> 02:31:01.093]  Makes absolutely no sense.
[02:31:01.093 --> 02:31:03.034]  No, I totally agree, but you look at Sean King.
[02:31:03.034 --> 02:31:04.534]  I mean, he is fake, man.
[02:31:04.534 --> 02:31:09.136]  I mean, Trevor Noah grew his hair out like he's locked in his house.
[02:31:09.136 --> 02:31:10.897]  They're in a lockdown as if he is now.
[02:31:10.897 --> 02:31:14.819]  I mean, this is, and so did, uh, so did, uh, Colbert.
[02:31:14.819 --> 02:31:16.660]  I mean, it's just all fake.
[02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:19.641]  It's fake, but what's crazy is Alex, their fans,
[02:31:20.322 --> 02:31:21.684]  They don't see it.
[02:31:21.684 --> 02:31:22.064]  Yeah.
[02:31:22.064 --> 02:31:24.968]  It's like right there in their face, they don't even see it.
[02:31:24.968 --> 02:31:28.673]  It's like... I'm telling you, the voter that votes left now...
[02:31:29.918 --> 02:31:33.880]  They're capable of thinking for themselves.
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:36.241]  They just follow whatever the TV tells them.
[02:31:36.241 --> 02:31:41.283]  That's why a majority of people that are conservative and Republican, they're business owners, they're leaders, they're capitalists.
[02:31:41.283 --> 02:31:42.824]  They think for themselves.
[02:31:42.824 --> 02:31:44.085]  They're entrepreneurs.
[02:31:44.085 --> 02:31:48.707]  People on the left, they think that this society is oppressing them.
[02:31:48.707 --> 02:31:51.888]  Well, if you're running your own business, you better know how stuff actually works.
[02:31:51.888 --> 02:31:52.669]  You're not going to be in business.
[02:31:53.949 --> 02:31:56.630]  Yeah, that's why Kamala Harris is so out of touch.
[02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:58.971]  That's why most of these Democrats are so out of touch.
[02:31:58.971 --> 02:32:01.631]  They can't function in real day-to-day society.
[02:32:01.631 --> 02:32:03.272]  They don't know how to run their own business.
[02:32:03.272 --> 02:32:04.192]  They wouldn't be able to.
[02:32:04.192 --> 02:32:09.094]  They just know how to lie and spew lies and make money off the taxpayers' back.
[02:32:09.094 --> 02:32:12.555]  Everybody should know, especially an entrepreneur or business owner, you cannot
[02:32:13.095 --> 02:32:18.077]  Invest millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands, or billions of dollars and be able to share that equally 50-50.
[02:32:18.077 --> 02:32:19.998]  Businesses do not work like that.
[02:32:19.998 --> 02:32:22.099]  Socialism does not work like that.
[02:32:22.099 --> 02:32:23.559]  They'll talk about some billionaire's wealth.
[02:32:23.559 --> 02:32:26.441]  That's always in the business and all the infrastructure.
[02:32:26.441 --> 02:32:29.542]  All the real billionaires, like Elon Musk, he barely has any real cash.
[02:32:29.542 --> 02:32:31.083]  It's the value of his stock.
[02:32:31.083 --> 02:32:34.344]  If he tried to cash out 5%, he'd go bankrupt.
[02:32:34.344 --> 02:32:35.104]  Right, yeah.
[02:32:35.104 --> 02:32:36.865]  His business is inflated.
[02:32:38.499 --> 02:32:45.344]  Yeah, people don't know that, that like, that, that, that, you know, because like one time they said, Oh, Jones's business was valued in court case by 80 million.
[02:32:45.344 --> 02:32:47.185]  I had people going, you got $80 million?
[02:32:47.185 --> 02:32:48.967]  I go, I don't have $2 million.
[02:32:48.967 --> 02:32:50.468]  They value it at that.
[02:32:50.468 --> 02:32:51.989]  It doesn't mean it actually has that value.
[02:32:53.089 --> 02:32:53.749]  Right.
[02:32:53.749 --> 02:32:55.249]  You have to liquidate.
[02:32:55.249 --> 02:32:57.130]  Man, some of these people are just idiots.
[02:32:57.130 --> 02:33:00.371]  They spread lies just like they said Amazon doesn't pay any taxes.
[02:33:00.371 --> 02:33:03.391]  Come on now, they don't pay no taxes.
[02:33:03.391 --> 02:33:05.092]  Yeah, and people believe that.
[02:33:05.092 --> 02:33:07.112]  But people believe it because they don't know how to think for themselves.
[02:33:07.112 --> 02:33:08.832]  They just take them for the word.
[02:33:08.832 --> 02:33:12.113]  Well guys, I want to come back and get in the final segment.
[02:33:12.113 --> 02:33:14.614]  Again, I said this and I diverted you, sorry.
[02:33:14.614 --> 02:33:15.934]  What do you think Trump should do?
[02:33:15.934 --> 02:33:17.814]  Because he listens to you guys.
[02:33:17.814 --> 02:33:20.235]  And I know we put pressure on him the last six months to get more hardcore.
[02:33:20.235 --> 02:33:20.635]  He did.
[02:33:20.635 --> 02:33:21.355]  He went up in the polls.
[02:33:22.381 --> 02:33:24.103]  Even though we know those polls are fake.
[02:33:24.103 --> 02:33:26.725]  The point is, what do you guys think President Trump should do?
[02:33:26.725 --> 02:33:27.746]  The Hodge Twins are here.
[02:33:27.746 --> 02:33:29.408]  Conservative Twins on YouTube.
[02:33:29.408 --> 02:33:31.390]  Instagram official Hodge Twins on Twitter.
[02:33:31.390 --> 02:33:33.652]  Hodge Twins, you want to follow them?
[02:33:33.652 --> 02:33:34.834]  You want to support them?
[02:33:34.834 --> 02:33:36.075]  I know I'm getting one of those t-shirts.
[02:33:36.075 --> 02:33:37.016]  Those are good looking.
[02:33:37.016 --> 02:33:37.536]  Be right back.
[02:33:37.536 --> 02:33:37.857]  Stay with us.
[02:33:43.323 --> 02:33:46.505]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[02:33:46.505 --> 02:33:57.491]  That's because it was completely scripted, and we even know the names of the United Nations, Rockefeller Foundation, Bill & Melinda Gates, and John Hopkins documents.
[02:33:57.491 --> 02:34:00.033]  We have the script, just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie.
[02:34:00.033 --> 02:34:06.997]  And it's designed to freeze civilization and have a post-Renaissance
[02:34:08.231 --> 02:34:16.374]  Stagnation or New Dark Age and a total consolidation of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[02:34:16.374 --> 02:34:18.515]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable.
[02:34:18.515 --> 02:34:24.457]  As you can see, all the checkboxes of tyranny are being marked carefully, every I dotted, every T crossed.
[02:34:25.077 --> 02:34:29.800]  A total societal vertical integration, takeover, medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:34.102]  The big tech heads on average have had their wealth cut about 35% in the last 8 months.
[02:34:34.102 --> 02:34:36.963]  And of course Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[02:34:36.963 --> 02:34:40.465]  Everyone is being forced out of their system to post human robot takeover.
[02:34:40.465 --> 02:34:41.486]  You're being made obsolete.
[02:34:43.590 --> 02:35:06.939]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio, every blue state, every blue city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[02:35:06.939 --> 02:35:12.762]  This, of course, is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[02:35:13.542 --> 02:35:15.843]  This is a power grab.
[02:35:15.843 --> 02:35:19.244]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[02:35:19.244 --> 02:35:22.605]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[02:35:22.605 --> 02:35:26.766]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S.
[02:35:26.766 --> 02:35:33.168]  for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans, is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[02:35:33.168 --> 02:35:38.449]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know the world's waiting to them.
[02:35:38.449 --> 02:35:40.269]  It's a very simple equation.
[02:35:40.269 --> 02:35:40.850]  It's illegal.
[02:35:40.850 --> 02:35:41.690]  We must resist it.
[02:35:44.485 --> 02:35:51.130]  You've always had a pledge from me, and it's that I'll come to you with the truth, at least as good as my human, temporal truth can get.
[02:35:51.130 --> 02:36:01.518]  Because as the Bible says, we all see through a rose-colored, darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually can perceive, so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:04.601]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[02:36:04.601 --> 02:36:09.705]  So, when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's got.
[02:36:09.705 --> 02:36:10.846]  But I'll tell you, it's all I got.
[02:36:12.111 --> 02:36:18.564]  And when I tell you that this country and the world is under major satanic threat, you don't need me to tell you that.
[02:36:18.564 --> 02:36:22.952]  You can look out the window, you can look into your own family, you can turn on the news, you can see it.
[02:36:24.036 --> 02:36:25.658]  But you've got this commitment.
[02:36:25.658 --> 02:36:27.680]  I do recognize the truth of God, and so do you.
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.341]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[02:36:29.341 --> 02:36:35.687]  And I want to keep InfoWars in the main position to fight, and that only happens when you support, which you've been doing.
[02:36:35.687 --> 02:36:36.648]  So again, I thank you.
[02:36:36.648 --> 02:36:42.314]  But go to InfoWarsStore.com, buy the product, spread the word, because that's how we're going to win.
[02:36:42.314 --> 02:36:43.095]  Again, I thank you all.
[02:36:44.159 --> 02:36:48.480]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:37:03.083]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great.
[02:37:03.083 --> 02:37:09.064]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, non-essential, that we're bad for the Earth, and we need to be phased out.
[02:37:09.064 --> 02:37:13.285]  So, they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us
[02:37:14.125 --> 02:37:19.906]  Just being very passive, living in the Matrix-like system that they're building.
[02:37:19.906 --> 02:37:27.127]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote, animal kingdom, is that we control our environment.
[02:37:27.127 --> 02:37:29.228]  We build our own environments.
[02:37:29.228 --> 02:37:30.548]  We create our own systems.
[02:37:30.548 --> 02:37:37.069]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[02:37:37.069 --> 02:37:41.690]  But instead, we're acting like animals, and the globalists play the part of humans, and us as cattle.
[02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:42.570]  And that's the trick.
[02:37:46.576 --> 02:38:01.490]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:01.490 --> 02:38:10.900]  Almost heaven, West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
[02:38:14.341 --> 02:38:22.605]  You know what I love about the Hodge twins?
[02:38:22.605 --> 02:38:25.366]  I've been watching them for years.
[02:38:28.951 --> 02:38:32.133]  Because they've got that positive Americana spirit.
[02:38:32.133 --> 02:38:33.033]  And they're not losers.
[02:38:33.033 --> 02:38:34.434]  They're not victims.
[02:38:34.434 --> 02:38:35.635]  They're not laying down.
[02:38:35.635 --> 02:38:39.197]  And I see the left so into being victims, so hateful.
[02:38:39.197 --> 02:38:40.758]  I feel sorry for them.
[02:38:40.758 --> 02:38:42.259]  Except they're so incredibly dangerous.
[02:38:42.259 --> 02:38:43.520]  I watch your show all the time.
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:43.900]  I watch it.
[02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:45.121]  It's in my feed.
[02:38:45.121 --> 02:38:46.522]  I watch you guys almost every day.
[02:38:47.202 --> 02:38:48.122]  I think he should just stay the course.
[02:38:48.122 --> 02:38:48.983]  He's showing effective leadership.
[02:39:07.498 --> 02:39:09.980]  I know the mainstream media is turning him down every day.
[02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:11.361]  People on Twitter is turning him down.
[02:39:11.361 --> 02:39:13.162]  I mean, he's doing a great job.
[02:39:13.162 --> 02:39:17.825]  So he should just stay the course and just focus on this election, getting reelected.
[02:39:17.825 --> 02:39:22.548]  Once he gets reelected, I think we're going to all see the real Trump come out.
[02:39:22.548 --> 02:39:34.917]  I think all these riots that's been going on in Portland, all across America, BLM, and he's offered assistance to get these cities, you know, get these riots calm down, get everybody safe.
[02:39:34.917 --> 02:39:35.577]  And they said,
[02:39:36.474 --> 02:39:39.375]  If he sends in a National Guard, he's inciting riots.
[02:39:39.375 --> 02:39:42.077]  I'm like, there's already riots.
[02:39:42.077 --> 02:39:43.817]  They're already burning down buildings.
[02:39:43.817 --> 02:39:45.378]  People's already been killed.
[02:39:45.378 --> 02:39:47.019]  Trump's inciting riots?
[02:39:47.019 --> 02:39:47.319]  Yeah.
[02:39:47.319 --> 02:39:51.521]  I think once he gets reelected, he'll be able to put his foot down.
[02:39:52.628 --> 02:39:55.769]  And take this country in the direction that he's already got it going in.
[02:39:55.769 --> 02:40:00.971]  Yeah, but by no mistake, by imagination, Alex, this country is at a civil war.
[02:40:00.971 --> 02:40:01.831]  Nobody's saying it.
[02:40:01.831 --> 02:40:10.355]  You have these people on the left that are turning down monuments, burning down people's businesses, both white and black, killing both black and white people.
[02:40:10.355 --> 02:40:11.675]  And nobody's doing anything.
[02:40:11.675 --> 02:40:13.776]  And I think it's because the election is coming up.
[02:40:14.361 --> 02:40:19.764]  I mean, I think Trump doesn't want to, you know, actually, you know, do anything that could jeopardize him getting elected.
[02:40:19.764 --> 02:40:21.905]  I think this election is very, very important.
[02:40:21.905 --> 02:40:30.989]  But I do think once he's reelected, he needs to put his foot on the gas and get restore law and order in our inner cities, in these liberal ran neighborhoods.
[02:40:30.989 --> 02:40:31.809]  Yeah.
[02:40:31.809 --> 02:40:32.670]  Yeah.
[02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:34.791]  But I mean, I think he's did a great job.
[02:40:35.678 --> 02:40:42.583]  I mean, nobody's perfect, but how he's handled the coronavirus and how he handles his State of the Union speeches, his rallies.
[02:40:42.583 --> 02:40:46.486]  I mean, the man has did a great job under the circumstances.
[02:40:46.486 --> 02:40:48.588]  I mean, put anybody else in his shoes.
[02:40:48.588 --> 02:40:52.290]  You think anybody else could have accomplished the things Trump has done?
[02:40:52.290 --> 02:40:52.571]  Yeah.
[02:40:52.571 --> 02:40:56.794]  It's like the whole time he's been in office, they've been attacking him.
[02:40:56.794 --> 02:40:57.234]  Yeah.
[02:40:57.234 --> 02:40:59.036]  I mean, with the impeachment.
[02:40:59.036 --> 02:41:03.239]  I mean, every week, every month, there's a new attack on him.
[02:41:03.239 --> 02:41:03.519]  Yeah.
[02:41:03.519 --> 02:41:04.940]  On Twitter, he's trending.
[02:41:05.552 --> 02:41:06.693]  Trump's hypocrisy.
[02:41:06.693 --> 02:41:08.713]  Trump's Nazi party.
[02:41:08.713 --> 02:41:10.354]  Trump lies, people die.
[02:41:10.354 --> 02:41:12.195]  I'm like, it's ridiculous.
[02:41:12.195 --> 02:41:22.299]  And it's, I find it very weird how you can blame one man for a virus that originated in another country.
[02:41:22.299 --> 02:41:23.200]  People forget that.
[02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:24.220]  That's a virus.
[02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:25.921]  Trump can't stop a virus.
[02:41:25.921 --> 02:41:26.161]  Yeah.
[02:41:26.161 --> 02:41:29.002]  People always say he is because of him so many people died.
[02:41:29.002 --> 02:41:33.244]  First of all, only 6% of the people that died from that virus
[02:41:34.122 --> 02:41:36.689]  Soul Cause was the virus.
[02:41:36.689 --> 02:41:37.330]  Right.
[02:41:37.330 --> 02:41:38.874]  That's right.
[02:41:38.874 --> 02:41:41.000]  60-70% of the deaths are people over the age of 60.
[02:41:42.031 --> 02:41:42.531]  Right.
[02:41:42.531 --> 02:41:45.132]  I mean, people like to point out how many people have died.
[02:41:45.132 --> 02:41:48.673]  What would you have done as a politician or a citizen?
[02:41:48.673 --> 02:41:49.913]  What would you have done different?
[02:41:49.913 --> 02:41:51.813]  He does the most balanced job he could.
[02:41:51.813 --> 02:41:55.875]  And since you mentioned that, former CIA officer, violence will explode if Trump wins.
[02:41:55.875 --> 02:42:04.817]  But he says it'll be, I agree, be even bigger if Biden wins because the left will try to see the country as weak and try to totally take over seeing Biden and Kamala Harris as weak.
[02:42:04.817 --> 02:42:08.218]  I mean, that, imagine if Trump loses what they're going to do.
[02:42:08.218 --> 02:42:09.458]  I think the left will go even more crazy.
[02:42:10.472 --> 02:42:11.672]  Yeah, man.
[02:42:11.672 --> 02:42:17.374]  Because the mayor of Portland, the mayor of Seattle support him, and then they come try to burn down their house?
[02:42:17.374 --> 02:42:19.054]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:42:19.054 --> 02:42:21.355]  Big ass, the snake eating itself, Alex.
[02:42:21.355 --> 02:42:25.656]  They want to support, they want to, they want to call these people peaceful protesters.
[02:42:25.656 --> 02:42:27.656]  It's not peaceful when they show up at your house.
[02:42:27.656 --> 02:42:28.836]  It happened in Chicago.
[02:42:28.836 --> 02:42:29.136]  Yeah.
[02:42:29.136 --> 02:42:33.918]  In Chicago, uh, she, uh, Mayor- Whitefoot said, I deserve security.
[02:42:33.918 --> 02:42:35.598]  She said, I get security, but you don't.
[02:42:35.598 --> 02:42:35.798]  Yeah.
[02:42:36.718 --> 02:42:37.339]  Yeah.
[02:42:37.339 --> 02:42:38.861]  I get to have gun protection.
[02:42:38.861 --> 02:42:39.581]  You don't.
[02:42:39.581 --> 02:42:43.506]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, like I said, the hypocrisy from the left.
[02:42:43.506 --> 02:42:49.513]  If you just sit and listen to both sides, I don't say anybody could be on the left, but they just go by what they hear.
[02:42:49.513 --> 02:42:50.234]  No, I agree.
[02:42:50.234 --> 02:42:53.658]  I think they're not self-aware because they didn't run their own business.
[02:42:53.658 --> 02:42:56.682]  When you run your own business, you're paying all the payroll, taxes.
[02:42:57.102 --> 02:43:00.683]  Getting the lawn cut, doing the regulations, the electricity, something breaks.
[02:43:00.683 --> 02:43:05.684]  You gotta get lunch, you gotta pay the taxes, you gotta get the product in, you gotta kiss some people's ass.
[02:43:05.684 --> 02:43:09.205]  And these politicians, he's like, well I'm important, Lightfoot said.
[02:43:09.205 --> 02:43:11.366]  I get a haircut, you don't.
[02:43:11.366 --> 02:43:13.006]  She goes, I get bodyguards, you don't.
[02:43:13.006 --> 02:43:17.668]  It's like in Minnesota, in what's the main city there?
[02:43:17.668 --> 02:43:18.168]  It's not St.
[02:43:18.168 --> 02:43:20.388]  Paul, it's Minneapolis.
[02:43:20.388 --> 02:43:25.490]  The mayor fires the policeman and goes, but I get private security 100,000 a day because I'm important.
[02:43:26.161 --> 02:43:30.883]  They say you don't get security in your house with a revolver, but he gets it.
[02:43:30.883 --> 02:43:35.385]  I mean, you couldn't write more hypocritical statements.
[02:43:35.385 --> 02:43:38.546]  Yeah, Lightfoot, when she went and got her hair done, she said, I need to get my hair done.
[02:43:38.546 --> 02:43:41.087]  I'm looking, I'm like, you got your hair done?
[02:43:41.087 --> 02:43:41.827]  You look a mess.
[02:43:44.522 --> 02:43:57.845]  Yeah, and Nancy Pelosi, man, those poor barbers and salon owners, they've been shut down for so long and she has the audacity to go get her done while these people can't even support their families because of her actions.
[02:43:57.845 --> 02:44:04.086]  But that's what I'm saying is they're not even aware of... Why are they not self-aware?
[02:44:04.086 --> 02:44:05.507]  Intellectually weak, Alex.
[02:44:08.365 --> 02:44:09.865]  They don't know how to hold themselves accountable.
[02:44:09.865 --> 02:44:11.446]  They're not used to thinking for themselves.
[02:44:11.446 --> 02:44:24.189]  If you're being told what to do, if you're under the impression that the person that you elect is your mother and your father and you're just supposed to respect and do whatever they say, you can't think for yourself.
[02:44:24.189 --> 02:44:27.110]  You're going to go through your life behaving like a small child.
[02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:30.951]  Yeah, and the left, the politicians just lie and hypocrisy so much.
[02:44:32.871 --> 02:44:34.892]  They can't even remember what they said the week before.
[02:44:34.892 --> 02:44:36.253]  They're so deep in their own lives.
[02:44:36.253 --> 02:44:36.473]  Exactly.
[02:44:36.473 --> 02:44:37.193]  They contradict.
[02:44:37.193 --> 02:44:38.454]  You just said it.
[02:44:38.454 --> 02:44:42.136]  They contradict and they act like a small child their whole life.
[02:44:42.136 --> 02:44:42.697]  Yeah.
[02:44:42.697 --> 02:44:52.362]  And the thing about Trump, man, what I really love about him, he does not point the finger at anybody until he wants to make a comparison what he's done compared to other administrations.
[02:44:52.362 --> 02:44:54.963]  You look at everybody on the left, it's always your fault.
[02:44:54.963 --> 02:44:59.446]  But when Trump explains things, he will only point the finger when he wants to make a comparison.
[02:44:59.446 --> 02:45:01.447]  What I've done and what the previous administration.
[02:45:02.168 --> 02:45:05.111]  He used it to give constructive criticism.
[02:45:05.111 --> 02:45:06.233]  Oh that's it?
[02:45:06.233 --> 02:45:09.697]  200 years of Democrat rule, how did that help black folks?
[02:45:09.697 --> 02:45:12.180]  And meanwhile, three years of Trump rule, how did it help?
[02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:13.662]  I mean, people can see the proof right there.
[02:45:14.554 --> 02:45:17.616]  Yeah, Biden's been in politics for what, 40, 50 years?
[02:45:17.616 --> 02:45:19.757]  And now all of a sudden he's going to help black people.
[02:45:19.757 --> 02:45:21.878]  Now all of a sudden he's going to do prison reform.
[02:45:21.878 --> 02:45:24.200]  All of a sudden now he's going to do police and reform.
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:25.801]  You had 40 years to do this.
[02:45:25.801 --> 02:45:29.203]  You had a black man as your president, and you didn't do anything.
[02:45:29.203 --> 02:45:30.664]  We don't need police reform.
[02:45:30.664 --> 02:45:33.445]  People should learn how to act around police officers.
[02:45:33.445 --> 02:45:35.987]  Well, I agree, but remember how Obama wouldn't even visit black neighborhoods?
[02:45:35.987 --> 02:45:36.887]  Why was that?
[02:45:36.887 --> 02:45:39.989]  And then Trump does.
[02:45:39.989 --> 02:45:41.330]  Because he knows it's not safe.
[02:45:43.328 --> 02:45:46.510]  I ain't going over to them black people yet.
[02:45:46.510 --> 02:45:47.870]  Trump got balls now.
[02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:49.231]  Yeah, Trump, look what Trump did.
[02:45:49.231 --> 02:45:52.073]  He went to see Kim Jong-Un Rocket Man.
[02:45:52.073 --> 02:45:53.474]  No president's ever done that.
[02:45:53.474 --> 02:45:56.415]  President Trump is a real leader.
[02:45:56.415 --> 02:45:57.055]  Point Blank.
[02:45:57.055 --> 02:46:04.159]  Yeah, I know the Secret Service and they say Trump will go into, not that he's scared of black folks, but a big black church or anywhere, and he says, don't harass, don't even really check everybody.
[02:46:04.159 --> 02:46:06.641]  Trump just goes in there, which makes me worry about him actually.
[02:46:06.641 --> 02:46:08.982]  What happens, God forbid, if somebody kills him though?
[02:46:08.982 --> 02:46:11.603]  Then you're talking about a real civil war.
[02:46:11.603 --> 02:46:12.384]  Oh man, that's...
[02:46:13.248 --> 02:46:14.488]  Nah, they don't want that.
[02:46:14.488 --> 02:46:16.829]  It's impossible to kill a president these days.
[02:46:16.829 --> 02:46:24.292]  As long as he's not rolling around in a convertible during a parade, he should be fine.
[02:46:24.292 --> 02:46:25.792]  Don't pull a JFK.
[02:46:25.792 --> 02:46:26.212]  Hey!
[02:46:26.212 --> 02:46:26.792]  I'm right here.
[02:46:26.792 --> 02:46:28.153]  Hey, you guys are kicking ass.
[02:46:28.153 --> 02:46:28.793]  We love you.
[02:46:28.793 --> 02:46:30.094]  We appreciate you.
[02:46:30.094 --> 02:46:31.914]  Hodge Twins, thank you for all you're doing.
[02:46:31.914 --> 02:46:32.934]  Everybody should visit you.
[02:46:32.934 --> 02:46:36.316]  They should visit your site and bookmark it in case you get censored off big platforms.
[02:46:36.316 --> 02:46:37.216]  We love what you're doing.
[02:46:37.216 --> 02:46:37.536]  Thank you.
[02:46:37.536 --> 02:46:38.796]  God bless you.
[02:46:38.796 --> 02:46:39.597]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:46:39.597 --> 02:46:39.897]  Thank you.
[02:46:40.777 --> 02:46:43.598]  Man, those are our brothers in the fight to restore the Republic.
[02:46:43.598 --> 02:46:45.118]  We love them, the Hodge twins.
[02:46:45.118 --> 02:46:49.579]  They're not scared to come on here, which shows they're even more Americana than we can imagine.
[02:46:49.579 --> 02:46:54.700]  All right, I'm going to do a few segments, and then the next guest host is taking over, but I got some other news I need to hit.
[02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:57.180]  I also need to pay some bills, and their t-shirts are awesome.
[02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:58.860]  I'm not lying, I'm actually jealous.
[02:46:58.860 --> 02:47:01.141]  We've got our new ones in, though, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:01.141 --> 02:47:02.321]  A listener sent me this design.
[02:47:02.321 --> 02:47:04.981]  I put it out, and it is.
[02:47:04.981 --> 02:47:06.322]  I got a bunch of new designs just came in.
[02:47:06.322 --> 02:47:06.742]  I'm just showing you.
[02:47:06.742 --> 02:47:07.742]  We actually have these in stock.
[02:47:08.564 --> 02:47:10.405]  Look at this baby right here.
[02:47:10.405 --> 02:47:13.086]  Arrest Fauci and Gates.
[02:47:13.086 --> 02:47:17.808]  And it's like Dayglo Blue with a yellow.
[02:47:17.808 --> 02:47:20.989]  And it says Mass Free Zone on the back.
[02:47:20.989 --> 02:47:22.910]  We've got that.
[02:47:22.910 --> 02:47:26.111]  And we've got this new shirt as well.
[02:47:26.111 --> 02:47:27.972]  People like something on the back of a shirt?
[02:47:27.972 --> 02:47:29.913]  This has got it on the back of a shirt.
[02:47:29.913 --> 02:47:32.614]  And it's got Don't Tread On Me on the back.
[02:47:32.614 --> 02:47:34.274]  And Infowars Shield on the front.
[02:47:34.274 --> 02:47:37.996]  And then we've got all these other new shirts that have come in as well.
[02:47:39.206 --> 02:47:43.148]  The don't tread on me front and back with the navy blue, but let me tell you what I'm really proud of.
[02:47:43.148 --> 02:47:45.089]  And they're coming in Monday.
[02:47:45.089 --> 02:47:46.969]  They've been printed right here in Texas.
[02:47:46.969 --> 02:47:50.911]  And that is Joe Biden for nursing home.
[02:47:50.911 --> 02:47:53.492]  And obviously once he loses, we're not going to sell anymore.
[02:47:53.492 --> 02:47:55.453]  It's 1776 plus free shipping.
[02:47:55.453 --> 02:47:59.235]  All apparel is 1776 plus free shipping.
[02:47:59.235 --> 02:48:00.855]  We had the famous Hillary for prison shirt.
[02:48:00.855 --> 02:48:01.576]  Everybody imitated.
[02:48:01.576 --> 02:48:02.056]  That's great.
[02:48:02.056 --> 02:48:04.617]  Well, this is the Biden's for nursing home shirt.
[02:48:05.816 --> 02:48:06.856]  The shirts come in Monday.
[02:48:06.856 --> 02:48:09.157]  They'll be shipped out to you.
[02:48:09.157 --> 02:48:09.978]  And that's it.
[02:48:09.978 --> 02:48:11.498]  Because we're only going to do a limited run of these.
[02:48:11.498 --> 02:48:15.260]  We're not going to sell you half the election, obviously.
[02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:19.342]  Especially if Biden wins, I think I'm going to go jump off a cliff.
[02:48:19.342 --> 02:48:20.342]  That's hypothetical, folks.
[02:48:20.342 --> 02:48:20.843]  I'm joking.
[02:48:20.843 --> 02:48:22.203]  I'm not going to jump off any cliffs.
[02:48:22.203 --> 02:48:23.924]  I will never commit suicide.
[02:48:23.924 --> 02:48:26.465]  All right, fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:48:26.465 --> 02:48:28.486]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:48:28.486 --> 02:48:30.247]  I'll finish up, and then, Knickback this.
[02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:40.489]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe, and it's free will.
[02:48:40.489 --> 02:48:49.681]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists, the anti-humans, openly tell you what they're doing.
[02:48:50.382 --> 02:48:55.005]  And openly tell you that you're worthless and crap and you need to die because that will save the Earth.
[02:48:55.005 --> 02:49:03.451]  They do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[02:49:03.451 --> 02:49:05.092]  They are making you hate yourself.
[02:49:05.092 --> 02:49:06.993]  They are making you be depressed.
[02:49:06.993 --> 02:49:11.997]  They are making you not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future.
[02:49:11.997 --> 02:49:13.898]  And that's what all this is about, you know.
[02:49:13.898 --> 02:49:17.781]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[02:49:18.361 --> 02:49:27.950]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientists, endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies, the globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:30.833]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[02:49:30.833 --> 02:49:31.454]  It's time to say no.
[02:49:35.419 --> 02:49:45.694]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep.
[02:49:45.694 --> 02:49:46.995]  It's amazing.
[02:49:46.995 --> 02:49:50.801]  Well, we set out a few years ago to go out and develop with
[02:49:51.061 --> 02:49:56.384]  Top manufacturers, the strongest, highest quality, purest fish oil out there.
[02:49:56.384 --> 02:49:58.525]  And this blend is amazing.
[02:49:58.525 --> 02:50:02.407]  Ultimate fish oil, back in stock at importwarshaw.com.
[02:50:02.407 --> 02:50:05.188]  Wild anchovy purified fish oil.
[02:50:05.188 --> 02:50:07.450]  Ultra pure Arctic krill oil.
[02:50:07.450 --> 02:50:09.631]  High quality wild caught salmon oil.
[02:50:10.151 --> 02:50:12.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:50:43.653 --> 02:50:44.974]  We are back live.
[02:50:44.974 --> 02:50:49.356]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[02:50:49.356 --> 02:50:50.637]  Love, love, love.
[02:50:50.637 --> 02:51:01.162]  That was the Hodge twins on for this last hour.
[02:51:08.052 --> 02:51:10.094]  Okay, Dr. Dick Vegas is taking over in about 10 minutes.
[02:51:10.094 --> 02:51:13.196]  I've got a few final things I want to hit.
[02:51:13.196 --> 02:51:15.478]  I didn't really get to this.
[02:51:15.478 --> 02:51:20.062]  They had over 6,000 boats on Lake Travis outside Austin last Saturday.
[02:51:20.062 --> 02:51:22.244]  And I was already set to do a live show here.
[02:51:22.244 --> 02:51:23.785]  I didn't go out there.
[02:51:23.785 --> 02:51:25.186]  But I saw how crazy it was.
[02:51:25.186 --> 02:51:30.070]  I guarantee you there's going to be aftershocks of that baby tomorrow.
[02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:31.351]  I bet there's a thousand boats out there.
[02:51:31.351 --> 02:51:32.873]  That's what I'm guessing.
[02:51:32.873 --> 02:51:34.914]  So I'll be out there about noon to whenever.
[02:51:35.851 --> 02:51:44.173]  I'll do a live feed into the Infowars.com forward slash show and we will break it all down for you because it's good to go out and celebrate.
[02:51:44.173 --> 02:51:45.813]  It's good to go out and have a good time.
[02:51:45.813 --> 02:51:53.855]  I see the Hodge twins who I know behind the scenes and on air just always are in a good mood and positive and that's how I want to be.
[02:51:53.855 --> 02:51:59.417]  Cheerful about this, positive, moving forward even if Trump loses which I don't think is going to happen.
[02:51:59.417 --> 02:52:00.297]  We just keep fighting.
[02:52:01.561 --> 02:52:04.544]  You know, the Hodge twins are my spirit animal, I think.
[02:52:04.544 --> 02:52:06.646]  And I hope to be their spirit animal.
[02:52:06.646 --> 02:52:10.029]  But we're all each other's inspirations, what I'm getting at here.
[02:52:10.029 --> 02:52:12.932]  And I get down, folks.
[02:52:12.932 --> 02:52:14.813]  I don't get suicidal.
[02:52:14.813 --> 02:52:19.638]  But when I read these type of articles, this is what I want to hit right now, I never get suicidal.
[02:52:19.638 --> 02:52:21.700]  I never want to die.
[02:52:21.700 --> 02:52:22.621]  But I actually feel weak.
[02:52:23.925 --> 02:52:25.227]  Like, I don't have enough energy.
[02:52:25.227 --> 02:52:34.882]  Sometimes I'm up there at 6, 7 at night, and there's a huge breaking story, and I know it's important to fight, and I want to fight, and the spirit's willing, but the flesh is weak.
[02:52:34.882 --> 02:52:37.326]  And I just kind of go, God, I love you so much.
[02:52:39.172 --> 02:52:42.995]  I kind of know what it's like when my grandma at nine years old said, I'm not worried about dying.
[02:52:42.995 --> 02:52:45.036]  And it's not that I even want to die.
[02:52:45.036 --> 02:52:51.361]  It's just that I know the purity of Christ and not being on this satanic plane must be amazing.
[02:52:51.361 --> 02:52:53.202]  But see, here's why you shouldn't commit suicide.
[02:52:53.202 --> 02:52:55.483]  And I'm not saying I would, I don't want to.
[02:52:55.483 --> 02:52:58.986]  I'm not even in that same realm, but I can understand why folks are like that.
[02:52:58.986 --> 02:53:00.127]  Because you want to punch out of here.
[02:53:00.127 --> 02:53:00.727]  You want to get away from it.
[02:53:00.727 --> 02:53:02.528]  But listen, you're a grown man.
[02:53:02.528 --> 02:53:03.509]  You're a grown woman.
[02:53:03.509 --> 02:53:04.650]  You know what's going on.
[02:53:04.650 --> 02:53:06.051]  You have a responsibility.
[02:53:07.472 --> 02:53:12.533]  To help innocents that aren't adults, that don't know what's going on, to protect them.
[02:53:12.533 --> 02:53:19.155]  And so quit worrying about how upset you are about what's happening, and start worrying about other people.
[02:53:19.155 --> 02:53:21.855]  And it's going to be that process of worrying about other people.
[02:53:21.855 --> 02:53:25.956]  Or maybe it's a couple plants you get that you take care of in your backyard.
[02:53:25.956 --> 02:53:27.377]  Or a dog or a cat you take care of.
[02:53:27.377 --> 02:53:30.237]  That's why people that have dogs and cats don't commit suicide as much.
[02:53:30.237 --> 02:53:32.438]  Because you've got something that's dependent on you.
[02:53:33.854 --> 02:53:36.296]  And so I'm not up here preaching to people.
[02:53:36.296 --> 02:53:40.779]  I mean, I get why people want to punch out.
[02:53:40.779 --> 02:53:43.361]  At my level, not commit suicide, but just leave.
[02:53:43.361 --> 02:53:44.302]  Not do this anymore.
[02:53:44.302 --> 02:53:47.064]  Not stare into the face of evil.
[02:53:47.064 --> 02:53:48.565]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:53:48.565 --> 02:53:51.588]  Let me try to quantify this.
[02:53:51.588 --> 02:53:54.650]  Every morning I wake up at like four or five in the morning and I go, I don't want to
[02:53:56.534 --> 02:54:01.096]  Or Barack Obama, or Big Mike, or General Mattis, or Lord Rothschild.
[02:54:01.096 --> 02:54:06.919]  I mean, they're all, or Abrinov, Abranovich, or Tony Podesta.
[02:54:06.919 --> 02:54:19.004]  I mean, but it's like, it's, it's, it's like, like I spend my life looking at them and looking at Netflix pedophile stuff and, you know, at a certain point I'm like, God, take me out of this, you know what I mean?
[02:54:19.004 --> 02:54:21.745]  But you know what?
[02:54:21.745 --> 02:54:24.967]  Those of us that care and have a conscience can see this and don't like it for a reason.
[02:54:26.352 --> 02:54:28.691]  And it's our job to stand up against it and say no to it.
[02:54:30.339 --> 02:54:33.121]  And so that's all I'm getting at is, I'm not here bitching at you.
[02:54:33.121 --> 02:54:34.623]  I'm not here saying you need to do more.
[02:54:34.623 --> 02:54:39.407]  Believe me, I want to load up in an RV and disappear.
[02:54:39.407 --> 02:54:43.050]  I mean, if there was some new country that was halfway free, I'd be gone so fast.
[02:54:43.050 --> 02:54:47.093]  This is a world government AI New World Order takeover.
[02:54:47.093 --> 02:54:48.534]  And we're not getting out of this.
[02:54:48.534 --> 02:54:51.937]  And I'll tell you right now, I happen to know the man upstairs.
[02:54:51.937 --> 02:54:57.502]  I know you all know him a little bit as well, or maybe more than I do, but I happen to have a little bit of a connection.
[02:55:00.919 --> 02:55:05.561]  You don't want to stand in front of God and not have fought the full fight.
[02:55:05.561 --> 02:55:07.742]  But I tell you, I'm a human.
[02:55:07.742 --> 02:55:13.545]  I tell you how I falter because I don't want you to think that you're weak because you don't want to fight these people.
[02:55:13.545 --> 02:55:14.005]  And I get it.
[02:55:14.005 --> 02:55:16.366]  It's not that you don't want to fight them because you're scared.
[02:55:16.366 --> 02:55:18.287]  They're so damn gross, man.
[02:55:18.287 --> 02:55:19.507]  They stink spiritually.
[02:55:19.507 --> 02:55:21.788]  They're disgusting people.
[02:55:21.788 --> 02:55:26.990]  And I know you don't want to focus on beautiful things and you want to focus on pure things.
[02:55:26.990 --> 02:55:27.691]  But listen, here's the thing.
[02:55:28.786 --> 02:55:34.467]  The pure thing is under attack because you're not fighting the evil thing.
[02:55:34.467 --> 02:55:43.069]  So pull your metaphysical sword of truth and start, start hacking.
[02:55:43.069 --> 02:55:45.350]  I know I say it all the time, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[02:55:45.350 --> 02:55:54.672]  I want to thank you, the listeners and viewers of this broadcast and all the stations and all the affiliates and sponsors and my family and the crew and just everybody out there.
[02:55:55.903 --> 02:56:01.444]  The listeners and viewers of this just said, this is such an epic struggle and we've all been proven dead on.
[02:56:01.444 --> 02:56:03.905]  We've been proven we're right because we're being led by God.
[02:56:03.905 --> 02:56:06.046]  We have a spirit and we're very humble about that.
[02:56:06.046 --> 02:56:06.946]  This is not us.
[02:56:06.946 --> 02:56:08.026]  This is God working through us.
[02:56:08.026 --> 02:56:11.587]  But man, now it's so precious to stay on air.
[02:56:11.587 --> 02:56:15.568]  I used to think, you know, maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of proceed into the
[02:56:16.468 --> 02:56:38.468]  Background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old but now with evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated I never questioned what I was saying because I knew it was true But I I did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out Well now we know they're gonna carry it out and then some so we got a fight and I just really appreciate you We're in this together and praise God past the ammunition the info war again.
[02:56:38.468 --> 02:56:39.248]  Take action folks.
[02:56:39.248 --> 02:56:39.669]  This is it
[02:56:44.994 --> 02:56:49.797]  Alright, if I could do this once a day, I'd do it.
[02:56:49.797 --> 02:56:54.079]  But if I don't do it, every couple of segments, we'll be shut down.
[02:56:54.079 --> 02:56:56.941]  So I appreciate all the listeners.
[02:56:56.941 --> 02:56:59.303]  I appreciate all the viewers.
[02:57:12.073 --> 02:57:16.915]  And I'm about to hand the baton over to Dr. Nick Magish, but I'll just explain it this way.
[02:57:16.915 --> 02:57:18.656]  I do not treat my body well.
[02:57:18.656 --> 02:57:20.517]  I love to eat tons of red meat.
[02:57:20.517 --> 02:57:23.138]  I live a super stressful life.
[02:57:23.138 --> 02:57:27.680]  I work 15, 16 hours a day, and I play hard sometimes as well.
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:29.461]  And so I tell you, take the supplements we sell.
[02:57:29.461 --> 02:57:34.823]  This is the very best out there, but I routinely forget to take my supplements for months.
[02:57:34.823 --> 02:57:38.585]  I'll get on them, have the little Lazy Susan on the table,
[02:57:40.179 --> 02:57:46.061]  I'll have them right here in my studio and then they'll clean it off and for two months I won't take it and I'll gain 15 pounds.
[02:57:46.061 --> 02:57:50.742]  That's how important clean pure iodine is with X2 or X3.
[02:57:50.742 --> 02:57:53.743]  Or DNA Force Plus or these other products.
[02:57:53.743 --> 02:58:01.466]  And so, they really are great products but even if they were placebo, even if they were sugar, which they're not, they're highest end you're going to get.
[02:58:02.625 --> 02:58:04.787]  They do fund this operation, which is really, really special.
[02:58:04.787 --> 02:58:10.733]  So, the books, the films, the water filtration, the high-quality, affordable food, it's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:13.123 --> 02:58:36.225]  I've been asked by some smart folks and strategic people not to get into what's going on here, but I think you know for the last five days we've been under Chinese hack attack, and I have a lot of trouble holding things back from the audience, but then when I talk about it, the enemy uses it, it becomes an issue, but you've seen how they've been deplatforming people, not just off the internet, but how they've been deplatforming people out of banking and credit cards.
[02:58:37.046 --> 02:58:56.496]  So I'm spending a good five hours a day jacking around with that and I'm kind of a whack-a-mole but let me just say it's it's it's ten times the attacks we ever dealt with before and at kind of a sick level I'm like well they just shut me down I gotta lay everybody off but I can at least take a break but I don't want to take a break but Barnaby does like God Almighty take a break.
[02:58:56.496 --> 02:59:00.958]  All I'm getting at here is is this is really in-game stuff happening and um
[02:59:04.898 --> 02:59:08.540]  You know, Trump's basically bankrupt because of this.
[02:59:08.540 --> 02:59:11.282]  They've attacked all his companies, all his things, and that's fine.
[02:59:11.282 --> 02:59:12.102]  We're not victims.
[02:59:12.102 --> 02:59:17.105]  We don't approach things as victims, but as champions and leaders in this fight.
[02:59:17.105 --> 02:59:18.826]  But I mean, it's not been fun.
[02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:22.894]  And so I've already mortgaged my house.
[02:59:22.894 --> 02:59:26.538]  I've already done it all to make sure we have just a month operating capital outside what we got.
[02:59:26.538 --> 02:59:28.681]  I had pressed on everything I've done.
[02:59:28.681 --> 02:59:34.908]  I have funded 50 plus organizations over the years covertly with no strings attached.
[02:59:34.908 --> 02:59:35.809]  I thought they were good people.
[02:59:35.809 --> 02:59:36.610]  In many cases they were.
[02:59:36.610 --> 02:59:37.731]  In some cases they weren't.
[02:59:37.731 --> 02:59:38.853]  I'm just saying you cannot bet.
[02:59:40.134 --> 02:59:47.380]  In the crap game of life or the roulette wheel of life on a number like 1776 that InfoWars metaphysically represents.
[02:59:47.380 --> 02:59:49.641]  So I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[02:59:49.641 --> 03:00:02.571]  Your word of mouth is just as important, but I just I'd be a liar if I didn't tell you that if we were like a battleship where we got fire shooting out the side and you know cannonballs, you know exploding and the whole nine yards, which is fine.
[03:00:02.571 --> 03:00:07.215]  I always expected this but 52 days out the deep state their whole system.
[03:00:10.157 --> 03:00:15.061]  I mean, you know what happened to like Romans where they'd take somebody's kid hostage and stuff like that.
[03:00:15.061 --> 03:00:19.425]  I mean, let me just explain something to you.
[03:00:19.425 --> 03:00:21.507]  Someday I'll be able to tell you all the stuff that's going on.
[03:00:21.507 --> 03:00:23.669]  And I don't feel sorry for myself.
[03:00:23.669 --> 03:00:28.113]  I just want you to know, to me, I'm a gauge, like a canary in the coal mine.
[03:00:28.113 --> 03:00:30.635]  And so, attacks before were like, you know, 50%.
[03:00:30.635 --> 03:00:31.576]  They're at 100% right now.
[03:00:33.709 --> 03:00:36.212]  The thermometer might break at the top.
[03:00:36.212 --> 03:00:38.495]  You know, Dr. Nick Begich, he's not a victim, he's an overcomer.
[03:00:38.495 --> 03:00:43.301]  They killed his dad for giving Native Americans and citizens of Alaska part of their own land.
[03:00:43.301 --> 03:00:48.247]  So, I mean, a lot of people paid for what we've got, and I'm ready to pay right now.
[03:00:48.247 --> 03:00:49.589]  Actually, I'm not even worried about it.
[03:00:49.949 --> 03:00:51.951]  I'm worried about myself and God and the rest of eternity.
[03:00:51.951 --> 03:00:57.335]  And you know, like Begich always says, people would give everything for that last five minutes of life until you're gone.
[03:00:57.335 --> 03:00:58.336]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[03:00:58.336 --> 03:01:00.898]  You've got eternity and now time is worthless.
[03:01:00.898 --> 03:01:03.641]  So I already get that Zen understanding.
[03:01:03.641 --> 03:01:08.425]  But I'm just telling you, I need to tell you as a gauge in a dashboard that
[03:01:09.125 --> 03:01:11.486]  That this is the big one, folks.
[03:01:11.486 --> 03:01:13.326]  This is the big enchilada.
[03:01:13.326 --> 03:01:20.389]  The way we break these balls right now, at the beginning of this pool game, is going to affect the whole next level.
[03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:27.131]  And so, your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, I would engage in it now, because it could be your last chance to get an InfoWars t-shirt.
[03:01:27.131 --> 03:01:35.874]  It could be your last chance to support us into the future, because I'm somebody that, you know, has been very close to destruction a lot of times, but we've never been this close.
[03:01:36.574 --> 03:01:40.358]  Uh, and so I do need to go ahead and just tell you that, uh, you know, we're, we're under attack.
[03:01:40.358 --> 03:01:41.760]  We're, we're SOS.
[03:01:41.760 --> 03:01:45.104]  We're, we're on fire in more ways than one spiritually.
[03:01:45.104 --> 03:01:45.965]  We're on fire.
[03:01:45.965 --> 03:01:49.368]  We're also on fire under enemy attack because we are in the fight.
[03:01:49.368 --> 03:01:49.508]  So.
[03:01:50.765 --> 03:01:51.666]  That's my transmission.
[03:01:51.666 --> 03:01:53.087]  I want to thank you all.
[03:01:53.087 --> 03:01:58.692]  We'll have live coverage tomorrow of the next Trump boat rally, and I'll be back Sunday, Lord willing, with a Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:01:58.692 --> 03:02:00.734]  We now have Sunday live with Owen Schroer as well.
[03:02:00.734 --> 03:02:05.678]  Dr. Nick Begich, scientist, researcher, best-selling author, great patriot, takes over.
[03:02:05.678 --> 03:02:06.839]  So thank you, Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:02:09.610 --> 03:02:17.313]  I want to pick up right where you left off, you know, because I think back how long we've been working together.
[03:02:17.313 --> 03:02:23.495]  And then about two and a half years ago, the first time we actually met in person, you know, I flew down to Austin.
[03:02:23.495 --> 03:02:24.155]  It was amazing.
[03:02:24.155 --> 03:02:25.015]  We hung out.
[03:02:25.015 --> 03:02:25.616]  Yeah.
[03:02:25.616 --> 03:02:26.236]  Yeah.
[03:02:26.236 --> 03:02:32.278]  And I spent a week with everybody and got to meet your team and who's there and, you know,
[03:02:33.291 --> 03:02:37.513]  Just before then and since then, every Friday, I volunteer my time.
[03:02:37.513 --> 03:02:43.836]  So, you know, what Alex is saying right now, I can tell you, is the absolute truth.
[03:02:43.836 --> 03:02:50.740]  And I remember that day, that night at dinner, we're having dinner and we're talking, and Alex is always running 110%.
[03:02:50.740 --> 03:02:56.722]  And at one point in dinner, he goes, hey, break out the camera.
[03:02:56.722 --> 03:02:57.623]  We're going to film it.
[03:02:57.623 --> 03:02:59.664]  You know, and I said, Alex, Alex, relax, you know.
[03:03:00.231 --> 03:03:02.453]  Because you're always working.
[03:03:02.453 --> 03:03:06.916]  And this is what the audience and people listening need to understand.
[03:03:06.916 --> 03:03:11.179]  It's not like, oh, the day's over, the light switches off.
[03:03:11.179 --> 03:03:12.880]  It never ends.
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:13.580]  It never ends.
[03:03:13.580 --> 03:03:16.282]  He's doing like 110 percent.
[03:03:16.282 --> 03:03:17.283]  And then what happens?
[03:03:18.001 --> 03:03:24.204]  You know, you're always running that speed and at some point you need a little bit of a break and you never get it.
[03:03:24.204 --> 03:03:26.005]  I know exactly what you're saying.
[03:03:26.005 --> 03:03:36.029]  And at the end of the dinner, I remember we were walking out of the restaurant and I put my hand in the center of your chest and I said, Alex, you don't need to run 110%, you need to run 90.
[03:03:36.029 --> 03:03:45.013]  So you've got 10% reserved to yourself so you can have that reserve, you know, and dish it out to your family and your close friends.
[03:03:45.613 --> 03:03:47.055]  And reserve that for you.
[03:03:47.055 --> 03:03:51.901]  And it's like you're diving to your own temple, you know, if you think about it that way.
[03:03:51.901 --> 03:03:55.405]  And you add about 10 years on to your life on the other end.
[03:03:55.405 --> 03:03:58.209]  You know, you live longer because you're less stressed.
[03:03:58.209 --> 03:04:04.717]  But the audience right now needs to support the InfoWarps and do something affirmative.
[03:04:05.217 --> 03:04:17.165]  That is material because that's the way that the green gasoline that keeps the thing going and the way it's done is the 360 and that's where everybody wins.
[03:04:17.165 --> 03:04:25.631]  So support the InfoWars, go to the InfoWars store, get something there that means something to you and can help you and your family.
[03:04:26.292 --> 03:04:27.673]  And do that today.
[03:04:27.673 --> 03:04:29.755]  So when it makes a difference to the InfoWars.
[03:04:29.755 --> 03:04:30.736]  Today!
[03:04:30.736 --> 03:04:32.397]  And I volunteer every Friday.
[03:04:32.397 --> 03:04:36.060]  I take my morning out and I get ready for the program and I do that.
[03:04:36.060 --> 03:04:44.968]  And I do that because two and a half years ago, I said, Alex, I don't want all the noise, you know, the transaction noise of selling books and selling products.
[03:04:44.968 --> 03:04:46.249]  I just want to give content.
[03:04:46.249 --> 03:04:48.811]  I want to give something once a week.
[03:04:48.811 --> 03:04:50.632]  And would you please allow me to do that?
[03:04:50.632 --> 03:04:52.514]  And we've worked this out where I get to do that.
[03:04:53.144 --> 03:04:58.326]  And yeah, I still have some books and some videos, but they're only sold through the InfoWars store.
[03:04:58.326 --> 03:04:58.907]  That's it.
[03:04:58.907 --> 03:05:01.628]  The only place you can get them, and those are you.
[03:05:01.628 --> 03:05:07.311]  And because I want to support this network, what it stands for, what it's done for a quarter of a century.
[03:05:07.311 --> 03:05:10.192]  It's been about the InfoWars, for goodness sake.
[03:05:10.192 --> 03:05:12.613]  That's all it's ever been about.
[03:05:12.613 --> 03:05:16.495]  And it's about, if you don't think it's about that now,
[03:05:17.190 --> 03:05:23.213]  You've not been paying attention to anything anybody's been saying for at least 25 years.
[03:05:23.213 --> 03:05:26.574]  Plus, I've been doing this quarter of a century.
[03:05:26.574 --> 03:05:28.595]  Alex has been doing this.
[03:05:28.595 --> 03:05:34.258]  And the team that's on board in Austin, your team, is incredible.
[03:05:34.258 --> 03:05:44.323]  Everybody there, what they do and the stress levels that happen up and down, you know, as you're trying to get the story out and you're trying to get the information.
[03:05:44.323 --> 03:05:44.743]  And so,
[03:05:45.743 --> 03:05:47.985]  Do something affirmative.
[03:05:47.985 --> 03:05:53.791]  Last week I talked about what you can do, you know, in kind of a script that can be followed.
[03:05:53.791 --> 03:05:58.675]  Do something in favor of yourself, your family, your friends.
[03:05:58.675 --> 03:06:04.301]  Extend to the Infowars family too and make something happen.
[03:06:04.301 --> 03:06:05.362]  And that's how we do it.
[03:06:05.362 --> 03:06:06.182]  We do it together.
[03:06:06.182 --> 03:06:09.846]  We're all that tip of that spear and we're all making a difference.
[03:06:10.453 --> 03:06:19.155]  In everything that we do, no matter how big or how small we think it is, and I've said it often, do what you know you can do.
[03:06:19.155 --> 03:06:24.156]  That's the step of faith in life, whether it's supporting this network or something else.
[03:06:24.156 --> 03:06:32.578]  Do something in favor of your own future and the future of those you haven't even met yet, the unborn, those that haven't even arrived yet.
[03:06:32.578 --> 03:06:33.799]  Do something for them.
[03:06:33.799 --> 03:06:34.979]  This is Dr. Nick Faggot.
[03:06:34.979 --> 03:06:35.639]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:39.275 --> 03:06:42.138]  Ignorance does not equal bliss.
[03:06:42.138 --> 03:06:45.922]  Ignorance equals slavery.
[03:06:45.922 --> 03:06:53.249]  If you're ignorant, walk through a field at night that there's a six-foot hole up ahead, you're gonna step in it and probably break your ankle.
[03:06:53.249 --> 03:06:54.490]  Or maybe worse.
[03:06:54.490 --> 03:06:56.913]  Well, it's the same thing happening to human civilization.
[03:06:57.793 --> 03:07:06.338]  The industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects, but also took us away from the land and made us very, very domesticated and very, very easy to manipulate.
[03:07:06.338 --> 03:07:10.620]  And now corruption and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity.
[03:07:10.620 --> 03:07:22.046]  Now, I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation and the Davos Group and the Bilderberg Group and all their subsidiaries, like the Club of Rome, say.
[03:07:22.046 --> 03:07:24.328]  So I know exactly what's going on.
[03:07:25.288 --> 03:07:32.271]  Not because I'm even that cool or special a person, but I actually want to be empowered and informed because I'm a history buff.
[03:07:32.271 --> 03:07:34.872]  I know that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[03:07:34.872 --> 03:07:36.033]  The globalists think you're stupid.
[03:07:36.033 --> 03:07:38.514]  They laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions.
[03:07:40.043 --> 03:07:43.085]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[03:07:43.085 --> 03:07:44.606]  They're going to contest the election.
[03:07:44.606 --> 03:07:46.347]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[03:07:46.347 --> 03:07:47.848]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[03:07:47.848 --> 03:07:48.928]  I want them shut down.
[03:07:48.928 --> 03:07:49.889]  I want them silenced.
[03:07:49.889 --> 03:07:50.709]  I want them muted.
[03:07:50.709 --> 03:07:52.551]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:07:52.551 --> 03:07:53.591]  You kept us on air.
[03:07:53.591 --> 03:07:55.152]  We did the analysis first.
[03:07:55.152 --> 03:07:56.213]  It's now gone mainstream.
[03:07:56.213 --> 03:07:58.294]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[03:07:58.294 --> 03:08:04.418]  And what they've said directly to us is, you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[03:08:04.418 --> 03:08:05.959]  And you need to stop right now.
[03:08:05.959 --> 03:08:07.179]  And they're very, very serious.
[03:08:07.179 --> 03:08:09.701]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshiping child molesters.
[03:08:09.701 --> 03:08:10.481]  This is not going to happen.
[03:08:10.481 --> 03:08:12.842]  So, they are moving out to destroy me.
[03:08:12.842 --> 03:08:14.403]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[03:08:14.403 --> 03:08:15.363]  Rescue InfoWars.
[03:08:15.363 --> 03:08:16.364]  Save yourself.
[03:08:16.364 --> 03:08:17.344]  Save the world.
[03:08:17.344 --> 03:08:18.525]  We're in this together.
[03:08:18.525 --> 03:08:20.265]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:08:20.265 --> 03:08:21.146]  Communism's up here.
[03:08:21.146 --> 03:08:24.487]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[03:08:24.487 --> 03:08:26.508]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[03:08:26.508 --> 03:08:28.789]  My children are right here!
[03:08:28.789 --> 03:08:30.890]  But I need money to fight a war!
[03:08:30.890 --> 03:08:32.290]  And I need word of mouth!
[03:08:32.290 --> 03:08:33.131]  And I need prayer!
[03:08:33.131 --> 03:08:34.391]  And I need action!
[03:08:34.391 --> 03:08:37.032]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[03:08:37.032 --> 03:08:38.633]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[03:08:42.347 --> 03:08:55.216]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:55.216 --> 03:09:02.100]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:09:02.100 --> 03:09:05.603]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:09:09.798 --> 03:09:15.769]  And welcome back, and it's good to be here this Friday afternoon in most parts of the country.
[03:09:15.769 --> 03:09:19.255]  Still a little before noon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[03:09:19.255 --> 03:09:19.496]  You know,
[03:09:20.623 --> 03:09:23.146]  I'm thinking about just everything that's going on.
[03:09:23.146 --> 03:09:29.453]  And I know it's the anniversary of 9-11 and people have been talking about that already today.
[03:09:29.453 --> 03:09:40.565]  And I'm not going to go there at the moment, except to say that, you know, big opportunities are buried in bad news, no matter what the heck.
[03:09:41.161 --> 03:09:41.762]  It is.
[03:09:41.762 --> 03:09:46.226]  And when you think about this, what did 9-11 roll out for us?
[03:09:46.226 --> 03:09:54.113]  It rolled out the endless war, you know, like we dropped back a few centuries into these 30-year, 100-year wars, you know.
[03:09:54.113 --> 03:09:56.416]  Alex was a history buff.
[03:09:56.416 --> 03:10:01.280]  My dad was a history teacher as a beginning point, you know.
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:04.343]  And history really defines a lot.
[03:10:04.343 --> 03:10:05.284]  In fact, I was
[03:10:06.252 --> 03:10:07.912]  I was talking about this book.
[03:10:07.912 --> 03:10:12.794]  It's the New American History by Woodard and W.E.
[03:10:12.794 --> 03:10:13.214]  Woodard.
[03:10:13.214 --> 03:10:23.156]  And this book, I ordered another copy because they're kind of hard to find because they printed the last ones in 1939, excuse me, 37.
[03:10:23.156 --> 03:10:27.457]  And so they're a little difficult to find, but it's worth reading.
[03:10:28.261 --> 03:10:38.227]  Uh, and because it was pre-World War II, you know, after World War I, pre-World War II, the guy who wrote it, uh, interesting, he wrote, he finished it, uh, just before 1936.
[03:10:38.227 --> 03:10:42.269]  And so his perspective was really a different one.
[03:10:42.269 --> 03:10:54.797]  That's before the internet, you know, that's before most people had telephones, that's before TV, that's before, uh, where people listen to the radio, you know, that was, you know, radio was it, you know, that was a big entertainment.
[03:10:55.737 --> 03:11:04.681]  And so, when you think about history, people used to read, you know, read books that you can't change after the fact, like you can a story on the internet, right?
[03:11:04.681 --> 03:11:10.943]  Wikipedia, you can pull it out, push it in, dance it around, make it up.
[03:11:10.943 --> 03:11:11.964]  Who cares, right?
[03:11:11.964 --> 03:11:13.864]  I mean, that's history today.
[03:11:13.864 --> 03:11:15.445]  Obsolete books.
[03:11:15.445 --> 03:11:16.626]  Get yourself some.
[03:11:16.626 --> 03:11:18.606]  Those are really not especially history.
[03:11:18.606 --> 03:11:20.187]  History's never obsolete.
[03:11:21.184 --> 03:11:32.293]  In fact, the perspective of a writer closer to the time might actually be more useful if you can interpret it in the context in which it was written.
[03:11:32.293 --> 03:11:38.338]  You know, that's why, you know, being a bit of a scholar, you know, you think about things differently.
[03:11:38.338 --> 03:11:48.107]  And I got, you know, I suffered through a bunch of things, you know, and Alex has built a big organization with a lot of risk and he's suffering through some things from time to time.
[03:11:48.727 --> 03:11:51.770]  You know, at one point in my public work, I lost everything.
[03:11:51.770 --> 03:11:53.211]  I had a bankrupt start over.
[03:11:53.211 --> 03:11:55.392]  That's 2002.
[03:11:55.392 --> 03:12:00.957]  Most people didn't know it, you know, because I started this work way before that, and I just kept on going.
[03:12:00.957 --> 03:12:03.959]  You know, I sort of hit a big speed bump.
[03:12:03.959 --> 03:12:05.160]  And so what did I do?
[03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:10.845]  I set up another way to make my living while I was continuing my public work, and I never stopped.
[03:12:10.845 --> 03:12:14.748]  And then I got blessed by some good things happening in my life.
[03:12:15.817 --> 03:12:16.197]  I think so.
[03:12:33.061 --> 03:12:34.762]  What's in it for them, right?
[03:12:34.762 --> 03:12:36.282]  And this is an important perspective.
[03:12:36.282 --> 03:12:39.503]  I've known a lot of very wealthy people, billionaires, in fact.
[03:12:39.503 --> 03:12:42.765]  I've known a bunch of very powerful political people.
[03:12:42.765 --> 03:12:51.048]  I've met presidents and vice presidents and congressmen and senators and scads of people in power, big business leaders that own big chunks of the economy.
[03:12:51.756 --> 03:12:58.678]  I've met a lot of people in my life because of the nature of what I've done in my life.
[03:12:58.678 --> 03:13:00.239]  And then I read all the time.
[03:13:00.239 --> 03:13:04.300]  My fiancée will tell you I read like eight, nine hours a day.
[03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:05.120]  That's what I do.
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:06.981]  That's my profession, actually, is
[03:13:07.541 --> 03:13:10.902]  To do that, condense information and pass it on to you.
[03:13:10.902 --> 03:13:14.323]  And then I make my living with my left foot, as one of my buddies used to say.
[03:13:14.323 --> 03:13:18.225]  And I'm very blessed in that because I get to do this.
[03:13:18.225 --> 03:13:20.565]  And here's what I learned about wealth.
[03:13:20.565 --> 03:13:23.046]  Wealth is about doing what you love doing, you know.
[03:13:23.046 --> 03:13:28.128]  And so you want to interpret people, interpret what motivates them.
[03:13:28.740 --> 03:13:31.341]  You know, and here's what motivates me.
[03:13:31.341 --> 03:13:32.582]  It's motivating you.
[03:13:32.582 --> 03:13:34.102]  That's it.
[03:13:34.102 --> 03:13:36.363]  You know, because I never organized the thing.
[03:13:36.363 --> 03:13:37.904]  You know, I don't have a big team.
[03:13:37.904 --> 03:13:38.944]  I don't have a team.
[03:13:38.944 --> 03:13:44.527]  I have you and the people that work in InfoWars and the other networks that I work with.
[03:13:44.527 --> 03:13:45.787]  That is my team.
[03:13:45.787 --> 03:13:48.108]  I always set it up that way.
[03:13:48.108 --> 03:13:48.809]  Why?
[03:13:48.809 --> 03:13:56.472]  Because I wanted to develop content and still reserve something so that I could keep being creative.
[03:13:56.472 --> 03:13:58.313]  Because this is what a lot of us miss.
[03:13:59.085 --> 03:14:06.932]  It's the creative things we do with our most valuable thing we have called time.
[03:14:06.932 --> 03:14:12.117]  In the physical, that is the definition of living well.
[03:14:12.117 --> 03:14:18.643]  With a living soul, occupying a body is the time slot that you get while you're here.
[03:14:18.643 --> 03:14:24.889]  Okay, so what I've been talking about a lot lately is not wasting your time slot.
[03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:27.992]  And not feeling frustrated because you're not running at 110%.
[03:14:27.992 --> 03:14:31.494]  You don't need to do that.
[03:14:31.494 --> 03:14:33.135]  You need to run 90%.
[03:14:33.135 --> 03:14:34.957]  That's an A, right?
[03:14:34.957 --> 03:14:37.098]  It's an A. Good.
[03:14:37.098 --> 03:14:39.740]  Reserve 10% to your own temple.
[03:14:39.740 --> 03:14:41.661]  Your body.
[03:14:41.661 --> 03:14:42.522]  Your body.
[03:14:43.445 --> 03:14:45.067]  And be respectful of that.
[03:14:45.067 --> 03:14:49.811]  And then your body and the extension of it through your spouse.
[03:14:49.811 --> 03:14:50.852]  All right?
[03:14:50.852 --> 03:14:53.375]  And your family and your friends.
[03:14:53.375 --> 03:14:58.019]  Your extension in the earth of this thing that we're engaged in.
[03:14:58.019 --> 03:14:58.960]  You have it for them.
[03:14:58.960 --> 03:15:01.222]  And for you.
[03:15:01.222 --> 03:15:03.444]  And that's okay.
[03:15:03.444 --> 03:15:04.585]  It really is.
[03:15:04.585 --> 03:15:05.506]  And here's the deal.
[03:15:05.506 --> 03:15:07.528]  Then you're then you're optimized.
[03:15:08.325 --> 03:15:10.047]  Then you're balanced and optimized.
[03:15:10.047 --> 03:15:11.748]  That's part of the deal.
[03:15:11.748 --> 03:15:16.473]  And you can go and weather the storm because you're the middle of the storm.
[03:15:16.473 --> 03:15:18.655]  You're the quiet part of the storm.
[03:15:18.655 --> 03:15:20.897]  You're the eye of the storm.
[03:15:20.897 --> 03:15:23.519]  This is the power of it.
[03:15:23.519 --> 03:15:26.242]  This is the wisdom in it.
[03:15:26.242 --> 03:15:27.243]  And you are it.
[03:15:28.408 --> 03:15:34.052]  Each of us in this game that we're doing together to change the reality of the world.
[03:15:34.052 --> 03:15:44.100]  Now, the other team knows this too, but they function through big organizations that they can then manipulate, infiltrate, screw with, whatever.
[03:15:44.100 --> 03:15:50.585]  I've always said from the very first day I started this, I would do it in a different way.
[03:15:50.585 --> 03:15:55.408]  A group of one, a committee of one, and I would energize a bunch of committees of one.
[03:15:55.408 --> 03:15:55.849]  That's you.
[03:15:56.815 --> 03:16:03.036]  Me, everybody else, because at some level we're connected.
[03:16:03.036 --> 03:16:15.559]  But if we begin to act out of something that pushes us, that we're passionate about within our living experience, we'll create very differently.
[03:16:15.559 --> 03:16:25.981]  And if we do it in a spirit of reverence, of divinity even,
[03:16:26.807 --> 03:16:29.529]  Of recognition, even.
[03:16:29.529 --> 03:16:35.695]  Of the truth, even, of what we say we are and behaving that way is really the message in it.
[03:16:35.695 --> 03:16:39.098]  And the experience of it is how we project in the world.
[03:16:39.098 --> 03:16:42.220]  Now, here's the big guys at the top, the Bill Gates.
[03:16:42.220 --> 03:16:49.427]  Once you accumulate wealth, and I've talked about wealth enough in other segments to define it, but I'll get into that a little bit before we get out of this.
[03:16:49.427 --> 03:16:53.250]  So I want to talk about the big guys and what motivates them.
[03:16:54.287 --> 03:16:56.210]  As it relates to you and me.
[03:16:56.210 --> 03:17:00.937]  So that we can then recognize the power they recognize.
[03:17:00.937 --> 03:17:05.544]  Only if we can recognize it as a mass of millions.
[03:17:05.544 --> 03:17:07.106]  Guess what?
[03:17:07.106 --> 03:17:07.667]  We win!
[03:17:08.726 --> 03:17:09.806]  We win.
[03:17:09.806 --> 03:17:21.831]  So, the message in today's program is grabbing our power back, stopping the looting of the world, and showing, uh, pulling the pants down on the new world order, okay?
[03:17:21.831 --> 03:17:27.973]  Because it's time to wake up and smell the roses and change the game.
[03:17:27.973 --> 03:17:33.115]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, you're listening to InfoWars, and check us out, InfoWars.com.
[03:17:38.809 --> 03:17:43.175]  Big Tech is the global straitjacket of the New World Order.
[03:17:43.175 --> 03:17:46.359]  It is the enforcement system, the surveillance system.
[03:17:46.359 --> 03:17:53.328]  It's going to track everything you do, everywhere you go, everything you say, everything you basically think, and then reward or punish you.
[03:17:53.789 --> 03:17:54.089]  I don't know.
[03:18:14.807 --> 03:18:15.608]  Extermination.
[03:18:15.608 --> 03:18:18.510]  This is their public master plan.
[03:18:18.510 --> 03:18:23.973]  COVID-19 is the cover for the rollout of this digital control system.
[03:18:23.973 --> 03:18:26.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's only going to get worse from here.
[03:18:26.815 --> 03:18:33.640]  When you see officials from Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, you are looking at people way more smart and way more evil than Hitler.
[03:18:33.640 --> 03:18:36.161]  They want to murder you and your family.
[03:18:36.161 --> 03:18:36.842]  You have been warned.
[03:18:38.359 --> 03:18:41.782]  I don't want to be right about this prediction.
[03:18:41.782 --> 03:18:44.464]  In fact, it's not a prediction.
[03:18:44.464 --> 03:18:46.686]  It is a forecast.
[03:18:46.686 --> 03:19:03.922]  If we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure of productivity, it will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure.
[03:19:04.742 --> 03:19:24.925]  I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute the people that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID con game, that's really just a big power grab.
[03:19:25.546 --> 03:19:31.191]  But in case we can't reverse all this, we better start digging in and getting storable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient.
[03:19:31.191 --> 03:19:33.974]  Because that's the name of their game, is to make us dependent on them.
[03:19:33.974 --> 03:19:36.276]  So get self-sufficient now in fullwars.com.
[03:19:37.972 --> 03:19:43.876]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening, and I point out that the globalists are a eugenics death cult because it's true.
[03:19:43.876 --> 03:19:45.697]  I don't say it to scare you.
[03:19:45.697 --> 03:19:48.179]  A lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[03:19:48.179 --> 03:19:51.941]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[03:19:51.941 --> 03:19:59.707]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[03:19:59.707 --> 03:20:05.630]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed blueprints of this plan.
[03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:07.772]  And more and more are being honest about it.
[03:20:08.512 --> 03:20:15.175]  Because there comes a point where, as David Icke says, they have to stop hiding it and start selling it.
[03:20:15.175 --> 03:20:18.036]  So we're at the point of the emergence now.
[03:20:18.036 --> 03:20:19.937]  And it's coming out in the open.
[03:20:19.937 --> 03:20:25.299]  And some people, under mass Stockholm Syndrome, are going to submit to any level of tyranny.
[03:20:25.299 --> 03:20:27.259]  But others are going to fight.
[03:20:27.259 --> 03:20:32.221]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be okay.
[03:20:32.221 --> 03:20:32.741]  No.
[03:20:32.741 --> 03:20:35.743]  This thing is post-human exterminism.
[03:20:35.743 --> 03:20:36.583]  Research what that is.
[03:20:40.006 --> 03:20:57.934]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:57.934 --> 03:21:00.055]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:00.055 --> 03:21:01.996]  Because there is a war on.
[03:21:01.996 --> 03:21:03.597]  For your mind.
[03:21:03.597 --> 03:21:05.518]  With Nick Begich.
[03:21:10.820 --> 03:21:12.261]  What a Friday!
[03:21:12.261 --> 03:21:25.231]  You know, here we are 9-11-2020 and man, I was thinking about during the break a couple things to kind of pull a few pieces of the segments together.
[03:21:25.231 --> 03:21:33.037]  I got an email this week from a 16-year-old in South Carolina, maybe he's listening even, and he asked me three questions and I want to
[03:21:33.712 --> 03:21:37.434]  I want to ask and answer myself those questions.
[03:21:37.434 --> 03:21:42.897]  And the first one he asked me was, in the state of affairs, you know, should I go to college?
[03:21:42.897 --> 03:21:49.160]  You know, I've been thinking about being a doctor or a lawyer or and I want to go into politics someday.
[03:21:49.160 --> 03:21:50.200]  And I'm thinking, wow.
[03:21:50.200 --> 03:21:52.401]  And he says, and I listen to you on InfoWards.
[03:21:52.401 --> 03:21:56.844]  And I'm thinking, I'm being asked, a 16 year old is asking me these questions.
[03:21:56.844 --> 03:21:58.184]  He's listening.
[03:21:58.184 --> 03:22:00.425]  And he's asked me, should I go to college?
[03:22:00.425 --> 03:22:01.686]  Should I invest in that?
[03:22:02.350 --> 03:22:05.372]  Is the world going to fall apart?
[03:22:05.372 --> 03:22:08.994]  Man, that's a pretty heavy-duty question.
[03:22:08.994 --> 03:22:10.474]  What do you say?
[03:22:10.474 --> 03:22:12.756]  And so I want to say it to everybody.
[03:22:12.756 --> 03:22:22.641]  I want to say, you have to know what's happening in the world, but you don't suspend what you're doing, like what's going on with this COVID-19 thing right now.
[03:22:23.599 --> 03:22:29.361]  You have to move forward because you don't know the hour and you don't know the day.
[03:22:29.361 --> 03:22:38.704]  And, you know, and I've lived long enough to see enough the end of the world scenarios to know that, hey, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
[03:22:38.704 --> 03:22:42.185]  But behave responsibly, not in some panic party.
[03:22:42.185 --> 03:22:47.027]  So plan your life like you would and do it prudently like you should.
[03:22:47.688 --> 03:22:52.232]  Don't get into a big student debt because you'll never escape it if things do fall apart.
[03:22:52.232 --> 03:22:56.275]  So be mindful, be sensible, approach it maybe a little differently.
[03:22:56.275 --> 03:23:02.920]  Don't rack up a big debt and think about what you're going to get educated in and how you're going to get your education.
[03:23:02.920 --> 03:23:04.602]  And where do you want to get it?
[03:23:04.602 --> 03:23:09.045]  And I would advise something else to a 16 year old or anyone else.
[03:23:09.045 --> 03:23:16.972]  Get a trade, you know, truck driving, banging nails, carpentry, electrician and a profession, engineer,
[03:23:17.944 --> 03:23:19.686]  Business degree, whatever.
[03:23:19.686 --> 03:23:20.707]  Get them both.
[03:23:20.707 --> 03:23:24.650]  I've done things with my hands and my head my whole life.
[03:23:24.650 --> 03:23:30.736]  Alaskans kind of do this anyway if you live up here very long or lived out of the cities at all.
[03:23:30.736 --> 03:23:32.777]  And so you do, you do both.
[03:23:32.777 --> 03:23:35.660]  And then you're a more equipped human being.
[03:23:35.660 --> 03:23:37.462]  You know, something that we've lost sight of.
[03:23:37.462 --> 03:23:42.646]  And everyone's specialized to the point now where you can't even think about making it.
[03:23:42.646 --> 03:23:43.948]  I can.
[03:23:43.948 --> 03:23:44.228]  I can.
[03:23:44.973 --> 03:23:53.258]  I've learned and I've gained skills, and I've collected enough books for what I don't know, and you see a little glimmer of it behind me, and read about 10,000.
[03:23:53.258 --> 03:23:55.579]  I'm not suggesting you've got to read 10,000 books.
[03:23:55.579 --> 03:23:57.420]  Be very selective, you know?
[03:23:57.420 --> 03:24:00.422]  Make sure you've got the right material on the shelf, you know?
[03:24:00.422 --> 03:24:06.545]  If you don't know how to survive, you better get some good books to tell you how and practice a few things, you know?
[03:24:06.545 --> 03:24:07.886]  But the point of the matter is,
[03:24:08.326 --> 03:24:10.468]  The world has always been this way.
[03:24:10.468 --> 03:24:11.508]  There's nothing new.
[03:24:11.508 --> 03:24:13.750]  It's just not happened lately at home.
[03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:17.052]  It's happening everywhere else, somewhere else, right now.
[03:24:17.052 --> 03:24:22.095]  If you travel a lot, like I do, around the world, you see a lot of suffering in the world.
[03:24:22.095 --> 03:24:29.200]  And you thank God every day when you see it, up close and personal, what a difference it makes to live in the United States.
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:37.205]  Because the next question he asked me was, what country would you go to if the liberals take over and this thing gets even worse?
[03:24:37.205 --> 03:24:37.826]  Where would you go?
[03:24:38.726 --> 03:24:45.809]  Wow, you know, having traveled all over the world, I'm here.
[03:24:45.809 --> 03:24:48.610]  Okay, I'm here.
[03:24:48.610 --> 03:24:52.392]  I'm in the United States.
[03:24:52.392 --> 03:24:56.113]  Wow, you know, do I like parts of the rest of the world?
[03:24:56.113 --> 03:24:58.174]  Yeah, there's a lot of places I've been.
[03:24:58.174 --> 03:25:04.237]  I've been to 50 countries, a lot of them several times, and a lot of them I like to visit.
[03:25:04.973 --> 03:25:12.739]  Um, I like, I wouldn't mind living for a period of time in a lot of places, but, uh, no, I, I think I, I would stay here.
[03:25:12.739 --> 03:25:18.244]  Um, even if it gets really nasty and bad, cause the other parts of the world are really worse.
[03:25:18.244 --> 03:25:21.967]  And this one, we might be able to hold and, and get back.
[03:25:21.967 --> 03:25:24.769]  And that's, uh, kind of where I'm at.
[03:25:24.769 --> 03:25:26.831]  Then the third question he asked me is okay.
[03:25:26.831 --> 03:25:34.097]  If, if you, if you believe in the United States and this is the only place we're staying, cause he was thinking ahead, he said, what state would you go to?
[03:25:35.021 --> 03:25:43.184]  And now there's an interesting question, you know, maybe the short list is which ones would you avoid, you know, and hey, look around.
[03:25:43.184 --> 03:25:51.607]  You know, I know Oregon, okay, is rioting and you hear about Portland, but a lot of parts of Oregon are very different, they're much conservative areas of Oregon.
[03:25:51.607 --> 03:25:57.230]  I know, I've been there, I've driven all through Oregon, driven, you know, with an automobile, you know.
[03:25:57.230 --> 03:26:00.731]  I've seen all the United States by automobile, not by jet plane.
[03:26:01.529 --> 03:26:04.672]  Uh, you know, and by jet plane, too, of course.
[03:26:04.672 --> 03:26:15.679]  But the point I'm making is on the ground, on the ground, it's cities, clusters of places where the craziness is going on and steroids.
[03:26:15.679 --> 03:26:19.562]  Now, in certain parts of the country, it spreads out pretty broadly.
[03:26:19.562 --> 03:26:21.824]  And I don't like what I see.
[03:26:21.824 --> 03:26:23.465]  And it's a national rollout.
[03:26:23.465 --> 03:26:26.247]  This is what also it's a global rollout.
[03:26:26.247 --> 03:26:30.150]  Really, when I see it internationally, it plays out with a little
[03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:40.115]  Shape it with a little cultural massage, you know, a little a little window dressing to make the picture look prettier than it actually is.
[03:26:40.115 --> 03:26:51.443]  Or you can say a map to hide behind, you know, a way to obscure the view a bit, get you to look over there when you ought to be looking over here.
[03:26:51.443 --> 03:26:57.527]  But, you know, thinking about this wealth, I was going to talk a little bit about this.
[03:26:57.527 --> 03:26:59.288]  So what state would I go to?
[03:27:00.198 --> 03:27:02.367]  You can evaluate where you're at.
[03:27:02.367 --> 03:27:03.934]  You can determine where you want to be.
[03:27:06.306 --> 03:27:07.406]  I like where I am.
[03:27:07.406 --> 03:27:08.667]  I live in Alaska.
[03:27:08.667 --> 03:27:10.528]  I hate the winters, I gotta tell you.
[03:27:10.528 --> 03:27:14.449]  I've been through a lot of them, you know, in 61 and being born here.
[03:27:14.449 --> 03:27:17.631]  But the winters are hard as heck, man.
[03:27:17.631 --> 03:27:20.092]  I mean, it's cold and it's dark.
[03:27:20.092 --> 03:27:24.693]  And the darkness is something that's hard to get used to no matter what, you know.
[03:27:24.693 --> 03:27:26.214]  And it's a metaphor, right?
[03:27:26.214 --> 03:27:29.635]  I mean, we go from darkness to light, darkness to light.
[03:27:29.635 --> 03:27:34.517]  That's the cycle of Alaska because we have the midnight sun in the summer and the darkness in the winter.
[03:27:36.747 --> 03:27:39.870]  It's a metaphor for who we all are, right?
[03:27:39.870 --> 03:27:42.953]  I mean, we come out of our own darkness into our light.
[03:27:42.953 --> 03:27:46.596]  Here, we cycle through it every year.
[03:27:46.596 --> 03:27:48.217]  And here's what happens, okay?
[03:27:48.217 --> 03:27:57.186]  As people build, and I talked about wealth and what it is, and as people build wealth, it gets to a point where, hey, what do you need?
[03:27:57.186 --> 03:27:59.227]  What do you want physically, materially?
[03:27:59.227 --> 03:28:00.809]  And there's a point where
[03:28:01.826 --> 03:28:02.887]  You actually have it.
[03:28:02.887 --> 03:28:12.411]  You know, I live in what would be considered a middle class, maybe even a little lighter middle class because I don't need any more than that.
[03:28:12.411 --> 03:28:20.055]  But it also makes my life a lot simpler, you see, because it operates really efficiently and allows me time.
[03:28:20.055 --> 03:28:23.017]  I get to keep my time and spend it.
[03:28:23.017 --> 03:28:29.360]  See, I spend my time as a priority and I budget my time as a priority.
[03:28:29.360 --> 03:28:31.401]  And that's what we each get to do.
[03:28:32.273 --> 03:28:33.594]  And then we get to program it in.
[03:28:33.594 --> 03:28:40.957]  Now, when you get to retirement age and you have a fixed income, well, hey, then you kind of get this rebirth.
[03:28:40.957 --> 03:28:43.739]  I've witnessed it with a lot of retirees.
[03:28:43.739 --> 03:28:49.302]  Now you've got time because your green gasoline is fueling your budget.
[03:28:49.302 --> 03:28:49.902]  So there's this
[03:28:50.652 --> 03:28:52.474]  People with wisdom know this.
[03:28:52.474 --> 03:28:55.296]  It's the retirees that have the power of time.
[03:28:55.296 --> 03:28:57.459]  So you want to create political movements?
[03:28:57.459 --> 03:28:58.960]  Retirees are your answer.
[03:28:58.960 --> 03:29:05.406]  You know, it's look for the blue haired ladies is what someone told me once and they're absolutely correct.
[03:29:05.406 --> 03:29:10.871]  Because it's about people who are committed to doing that make a difference.
[03:29:10.871 --> 03:29:13.294]  And when you get your time back, you get to do more.
[03:29:13.294 --> 03:29:15.716]  Now think about that from a Bill Gates perspective.
[03:29:16.457 --> 03:29:23.082]  Here's a dude that's got like all the money under the sun so that money isn't so valuable anymore.
[03:29:23.082 --> 03:29:25.364]  But doing stuff with it is.
[03:29:25.364 --> 03:29:25.664]  Okay?
[03:29:25.664 --> 03:29:30.528]  Because that's just how he creates whatever he thinks he ought to be creating.
[03:29:30.528 --> 03:29:32.549]  But he does it tax-free.
[03:29:32.549 --> 03:29:32.830]  Okay?
[03:29:32.830 --> 03:29:34.671]  He does it tax-exempt.
[03:29:34.671 --> 03:29:39.435]  He does it by screwing you and then BSing.
[03:29:39.435 --> 03:29:40.415]  Okay?
[03:29:40.415 --> 03:29:45.059]  This is what so many nonprofits do that you fail and we fail to see.
[03:29:45.962 --> 03:29:53.270]  Because we think about their public purpose, but what we don't think about is their public influence.
[03:29:53.270 --> 03:29:59.396]  And I want to talk about that because it's about the power of influence that creates outcomes.
[03:29:59.396 --> 03:30:05.002]  When big nonprofits get big money and can influence things in a certain way,
[03:30:05.882 --> 03:30:09.544]  And there's only a certain way they can and a certain way they can't.
[03:30:09.544 --> 03:30:26.892]  And I want to talk about the rules of nonprofits and why they work against you and how they can work for you, but how the big guys use it to screw you and me over with their good works as they pave the road to hell with gold.
[03:30:26.892 --> 03:30:31.074]  And that's the story for today, for the last segment, going into the last segment.
[03:30:31.074 --> 03:30:32.035]  This is Dr. Nick Peggage.
[03:30:32.035 --> 03:30:32.975]  We'll be right back with it.
[03:30:36.929 --> 03:30:50.574]  Well, Mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with Bloomberg to launch this Operation Red Mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night.
[03:30:50.574 --> 03:30:58.537]  Now he's come out in a statement and told all the media in the United States that they better get behind saying that Trump basically lost and that they're not going to let him.
[03:30:58.757 --> 03:31:01.279]  Trump declared victory, even though it's overwhelming.
[03:31:01.279 --> 03:31:07.823]  They'll have 95% of the vote done on election night, and even if you added all the other votes in, against him, he'd be the winner.
[03:31:07.823 --> 03:31:09.784]  They are going to steal this election.
[03:31:09.784 --> 03:31:10.885]  They're preparing everyone.
[03:31:10.885 --> 03:31:13.266]  You've seen all the scams they've already run.
[03:31:13.266 --> 03:31:18.429]  Trump is surrounded by tyrants, but he has we the people, and he has true media.
[03:31:18.429 --> 03:31:20.451]  Not independent media, the real media.
[03:31:20.991 --> 03:31:36.870]  So now more than ever it's critical to share the live streams, the videos, the articles, and the information at InfoWars.com because the globalists fear it most because we were the first to expose their plan to contest the election and drag it out to keep the American people from re-electing President Trump.
[03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:39.513]  The clock is ticking on the once free world.
[03:31:40.609 --> 03:31:43.830]  And the free press is under attack more than ever.
[03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:54.353]  I now see videos 10 or 15 times a day, without even trying to find them, of press being arrested in the United States, press being arrested in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand.
[03:31:54.353 --> 03:31:59.095]  And it's always the so-called liberal left, the defenders of speech, doing it.
[03:31:59.095 --> 03:32:06.137]  They are the authoritarians, they work for the Chai Com Globalist Combine, and they are working around the clock
[03:32:07.116 --> 03:32:08.897]  to silence InfoWars.
[03:32:08.897 --> 03:32:16.640]  Just as we were the group they started with three years ago, they test out everything new on us, and a lot of it I can't get into on air at this point.
[03:32:16.640 --> 03:32:26.245]  I'll be able to reveal this later, but I just want to make you all realize that your support, your word of mouth, your prayer is absolutely essential, and I thank you all for it.

[03:32:37.964 --> 03:32:57.197]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, The Washington Post, or Howard Stern, you name it, they come out and they attack him full force, saying, Jones claims civil war is coming, and financial collapse, and planetary lockdowns using viruses, and he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have storable food, if they can.
[03:32:57.777 --> 03:33:03.802]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true, because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents.
[03:33:03.802 --> 03:33:08.125]  Like lockstep, this is the corporate planetary takeover.

[03:33:37.788 --> 03:33:42.109]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[03:33:42.109 --> 03:33:52.931]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats.
[03:33:52.931 --> 03:33:56.732]  And that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great.
[03:33:56.732 --> 03:34:02.713]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, non-essential, that we're bad for the Earth, that we need to be phased out.
[03:34:02.713 --> 03:34:06.914]  So, they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us.
[03:34:07.774 --> 03:34:13.555]  Just being very passive, living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[03:34:13.555 --> 03:34:20.757]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote, animal kingdom, is that we control our environment.
[03:34:20.757 --> 03:34:22.858]  We build our own environments.
[03:34:22.858 --> 03:34:24.198]  We create our own systems.
[03:34:24.198 --> 03:34:30.700]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[03:34:30.700 --> 03:34:35.341]  But instead, we're acting like animals, letting the globalists play the part of humans, and us as cattle.
[03:34:35.341 --> 03:34:36.201]  And that's the trick.
[03:34:40.996 --> 03:34:58.927]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:58.927 --> 03:35:04.571]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[03:35:08.994 --> 03:35:11.796]  And welcome, welcome back.
[03:35:11.796 --> 03:35:24.866]  You know, thinking about this again, you know, people ask me all the time, how can you be so, you're always smiling, you know, how can you have that attitude when, when you know all this stuff is going on in the world?
[03:35:24.866 --> 03:35:28.389]  And, and, you know, really, it's a lot of things.
[03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:32.572]  I mean, I can't really explain it in one segment, and I'm not going to even attempt to today.
[03:35:32.572 --> 03:35:32.692]  But
[03:35:33.513 --> 03:35:46.362]  I can tell you it's a lifetime of doing and experiencing and learning from those experiences, both the hard way and sometimes, fortunately, by the grace of God, a little easier ways.
[03:35:48.308 --> 03:35:56.074]  But what I've really come to is I get to do what I love doing, you know, and that's where I am in my life.
[03:35:56.074 --> 03:36:04.560]  And I get to do this every Friday, talk to a few million people, and pass on what I've learned in the week or what's occurred to me at the moment.
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:07.343]  And it comes out pretty well usually.
[03:36:07.343 --> 03:36:08.503]  You know, when I think about
[03:36:10.457 --> 03:36:11.517]  What motivates people?
[03:36:11.517 --> 03:36:13.658]  We were talking about that in the last segment.
[03:36:13.658 --> 03:36:16.619]  And on the big scale, here's how it goes.
[03:36:16.619 --> 03:36:27.983]  Once you've achieved a level of success monetarily, that's kind of like, what are you doing?
[03:36:27.983 --> 03:36:32.585]  And you don't do it just to grab more piles of fiat.
[03:36:32.585 --> 03:36:36.046]  Some people do, but they're chasing a rainbow in a fiction.
[03:36:36.798 --> 03:36:41.262]  To begin with, most people don't acquire big wealth.
[03:36:41.262 --> 03:36:45.426]  What they have is a vision of what they want to do.
[03:36:45.426 --> 03:36:50.891]  And they go after that vision and then they figure out what they get pulled into.
[03:36:50.891 --> 03:36:52.512]  You know, they build a plan around it.
[03:36:52.512 --> 03:36:55.155]  I know Alex built his vision that way.
[03:36:55.155 --> 03:36:56.336]  I built mine that way.
[03:36:56.336 --> 03:36:59.358]  And everybody I know that ever built a vision built it that way.
[03:36:59.358 --> 03:36:59.959]  You did too.
[03:37:00.888 --> 03:37:01.869]  Every one of us did.
[03:37:01.869 --> 03:37:04.891]  Whatever that vision for our life is, we construct it.
[03:37:04.891 --> 03:37:07.493]  And that's what that 16-year-old was really asking me.
[03:37:07.493 --> 03:37:10.476]  And I say, have a vision for your life and go construct it.
[03:37:10.476 --> 03:37:11.336]  Go create it.
[03:37:11.336 --> 03:37:14.699]  In fact, I'd say be the doctor and the lawyer and the politician.
[03:37:14.699 --> 03:37:15.300]  Do them all.
[03:37:15.300 --> 03:37:17.321]  Why should you do just one?
[03:37:17.321 --> 03:37:18.782]  Life could go a long time.
[03:37:18.782 --> 03:37:20.384]  You know, you might get time to do them all.
[03:37:20.384 --> 03:37:21.745]  Do them all.
[03:37:21.745 --> 03:37:22.625]  Be curious.
[03:37:22.625 --> 03:37:24.587]  Be inquisitive.
[03:37:24.587 --> 03:37:25.528]  Stretch your limits.
[03:37:26.272 --> 03:37:28.173]  Figure out what you're about.
[03:37:28.173 --> 03:37:31.074]  Go internal every once in a while and make sure you're doing it right.
[03:37:31.074 --> 03:37:33.515]  You know, test yourself a little bit.
[03:37:33.515 --> 03:37:45.259]  But these guys, once they achieve, and you too, a certain level, and don't make it so high that you're just a consumer, a grabber, a spender, a consumer.
[03:37:45.259 --> 03:37:46.600]  Do it so you're a producer.
[03:37:47.768 --> 03:37:49.769]  That you're creating something.
[03:37:49.769 --> 03:37:53.570]  See, those were those four things I was mentioning, you know, in several segments.
[03:37:53.570 --> 03:37:57.751]  Entrepreneurship, which is creative talent applied to business.
[03:37:57.751 --> 03:38:04.053]  And labor, your time, your time, you know, your back provided into labor.
[03:38:04.053 --> 03:38:11.816]  And then capital equipment, whether it's a shovel, a squeegee or a factory making stuff, things that make things, that's capital.
[03:38:12.596 --> 03:38:18.920]  Or natural resources and land, the real stuff, you know, that builds real wealth.
[03:38:18.920 --> 03:38:31.147]  Once you have a baseline of subsistence, whatever that represents in your life, in Alaska we can talk about subsistence, in the bush that means something different, but it means really the same thing.
[03:38:31.147 --> 03:38:35.269]  It's about enjoying a way of living that is sufficient for you.
[03:38:36.741 --> 03:38:46.104]  And then after that, it's all about creation and how you use your time, whether it's to spend it with your grandkids or your family or however you decide to do it.
[03:38:46.104 --> 03:38:46.785]  You get to do it.
[03:38:46.785 --> 03:38:50.206]  You get to do all of it along the way.
[03:38:50.206 --> 03:38:58.788]  And the beauty of it is at the end of the day, whatever you create, it's your responsibility, good or bad.
[03:38:58.788 --> 03:39:00.269]  So choose as well as you can.
[03:39:00.269 --> 03:39:03.230]  And if you've done it, when you think you put the label bad on it,
[03:39:04.424 --> 03:39:04.624]  Yes.
[03:39:27.463 --> 03:39:30.084]  And with the slavery we're in, and when does freedom begin?
[03:39:30.084 --> 03:39:35.647]  And for a lot of people, freedom begins at 65 or 67 or 70.
[03:39:35.647 --> 03:39:36.647]  And think about it.
[03:39:36.647 --> 03:39:45.872]  By then, if you stayed healthy, and you've done it at a 90% ratio instead of the 110, you probably got 20 more to go.
[03:39:45.872 --> 03:39:46.572]  You know?
[03:39:46.572 --> 03:39:49.874]  And 20 more without having to worry about
[03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.849]  I think so.
[03:40:10.470 --> 03:40:19.352]  With a spirit of divinity, of kindness, of graciousness, of the truth of trying to inform, not debate and raise people's anger.
[03:40:19.352 --> 03:40:22.712]  And, you know, we do that, too, because sometimes that's the way it works.
[03:40:22.712 --> 03:40:31.514]  And a lot of folks have talked to me and helped me figure out some things about how we approach change.
[03:40:31.514 --> 03:40:35.855]  And you can do it in all different ways at all different volumes.
[03:40:35.855 --> 03:40:36.735]  OK, and that's OK.
[03:40:37.775 --> 03:40:44.422]  Because everybody responds differently to different approaches to information, and I think that's the important thing.
[03:41:11.744 --> 03:41:18.326]  President Trump is taking fire from all sides as he continues to reassure the country that he won't stop fighting.
[03:41:18.326 --> 03:41:21.727]  We are returning power to you, the American people.
[03:41:21.727 --> 03:41:33.471]  With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
[03:41:33.911 --> 03:41:41.997]  The attacks didn't stop Trump from being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, which Trump earned, unlike President Obama.
[03:41:41.997 --> 03:41:50.423]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden's faction of power-hungry New World Order goons is wargaming how to take power, even if Trump is re-elected.
[03:41:50.423 --> 03:42:01.851]  As Jamie White reports, a far-left coalition wargamed several post-election apocalyptic scenarios in case Democrat candidate Joe Biden lost to President Trump.
[03:42:02.011 --> 03:42:13.253]  Predicting that Infowars would get involved by doxing Joe Biden electors and linking 88 of these electors to George Soros and 14 to child sex trafficking.
[03:42:13.253 --> 03:42:28.416]  In a bizarre piece by the Daily Beast entitled, The Left Secretly Preps for MAGA Violence After Election Day, a group called the Fight Back Table analyzed different election scenarios that draw from the Transition Integrity Project's white paper
[03:42:28.476 --> 03:42:29.116]  We're good to go.
[03:42:47.728 --> 03:42:57.515]  It's run by George Soros and the Open Society Institute, and it's partnered with a group linked with the Chinese Communist Party, the McGruin Institute.
[03:42:57.515 --> 03:43:03.779]  One source familiar with the Democracy Defense Nerve Center operation said some of the hurdles were straightforward.
[03:43:03.779 --> 03:43:09.563]  How you occupy, hold space, and shut things down, not just on election day, but for weeks.
[03:43:09.563 --> 03:43:13.906]  Some people expected there to be an answer to who won the election on election night.
[03:43:13.906 --> 03:43:16.028]  I don't think we're necessarily going to get that, and
[03:43:16.648 --> 03:43:20.049]  I think it's important that we start preparing people now.
[03:43:20.049 --> 03:43:25.831]  That there's nothing illegitimate about taking a few extra days or even weeks in order to make sure that all the votes get counted.
[03:43:25.831 --> 03:43:30.473]  In fact, it would be illegitimate if we didn't make sure that all of the ballot votes were counted.
[03:43:30.473 --> 03:43:34.374]  I think that this is important because there is, unfortunately, I think,
[03:43:35.354 --> 03:43:39.355]  If that were to happen, would Facebook be blamed in part?
[03:44:00.622 --> 03:44:13.977]  Others are more complicated, like what quick transportation options can be in place should poll locations mysteriously close, while others have been simply impossible to plan out, the Daily Beast continued.
[03:44:13.977 --> 03:44:18.962]  But hardball tactics would bring more aggressive responses from the right, the Beast reported.
[03:44:19.182 --> 03:44:30.926]  The simulation for a narrow Biden win saw a scenario in which InfoWars published a list of addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information of electors pledged to vote for Joe Biden.
[03:44:30.926 --> 03:44:35.608]  Of course, InfoWars wouldn't publish anything without having evidence to support it.
[03:44:35.608 --> 03:44:39.089]  And why would exposing child trafficking be a bad thing?
[03:44:39.489 --> 03:44:46.034]  You are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[03:44:46.034 --> 03:44:50.398]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[03:44:50.398 --> 03:44:56.522]  Well, I haven't heard that, but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[03:44:56.522 --> 03:44:56.963]  I mean, you know.
[03:44:58.243 --> 03:45:02.165]  If I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it.
[03:45:02.165 --> 03:45:04.326]  I'm willing to put myself out there.
[03:45:04.326 --> 03:45:13.750]  All of this as professional sleazeball Michael Cohen, who is on house arrest due to tax evasion and campaign violations, attempts to tarnish the president's image.
[03:45:13.750 --> 03:45:18.993]  I described Mr. Trump as a cult leader, and I was in this cult.
[03:45:18.993 --> 03:45:25.536]  While I was in the cult, I was really refusing to acknowledge that the actions that I was performing for my boss
