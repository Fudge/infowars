[00:00.000 --> 00:13.600]  Nineteen years ago, the United States saw the biggest terror attack on our domestic soil
[00:13.600 --> 00:19.720]  in our history, and I was there covering it live as it unfolded.
[00:19.720 --> 00:25.160]  Dr. Steve Pachennick will join us on the specifics of 9-11, and some of the top generals he talked
[00:25.160 --> 00:29.640]  to that were fully aware of how the terror attacks were carried out by criminal elements
[00:29.640 --> 00:34.760]  inside our government working with radical Islam.
[00:34.760 --> 00:36.360]  That is coming up.
[00:36.360 --> 00:41.440]  The Hodge Twins will also be joining us today, and I also intend to try to open the phones
[00:41.440 --> 00:42.440]  up.
[00:42.440 --> 00:47.400]  It is September 11th, Friday, September 11th, the year is 2020.
[00:47.400 --> 00:50.680]  We're 52 days out right now.
[00:50.680 --> 01:01.080]  And I have seen Trump very few times get a tear in his eye, but he certainly did that
[01:01.080 --> 01:08.560]  yesterday in Michigan when the crowd was chanting that they love him because he needs that energy
[01:08.560 --> 01:13.000]  because he's under massive, massive attack and he also needs our prayers.
[01:13.000 --> 01:24.200]  Here's the President who had to fight back tears.
[01:24.200 --> 01:26.280]  Especially when you have a crowd like this, but they're like this.
[01:26.280 --> 01:28.400]  They have such spirit in this country.
[01:28.400 --> 01:29.560]  People love our country so much.
[01:29.560 --> 01:30.560]  I went to Texas.
[01:30.560 --> 01:31.560]  I went to Ohio.
[01:31.560 --> 01:32.560]  I went to Florida.
[01:32.560 --> 01:34.240]  It's always like this.
[01:34.240 --> 01:38.880]  They love our country, and we're not going to disappoint anybody.
[01:38.880 --> 01:41.600]  We're not disappointed.
[01:41.600 --> 01:48.600]  For years, you had a President who apologized for America.
[01:48.600 --> 01:59.880]  We love you, we love you, we love you, we love you, we love you, we love you, we love you.
[01:59.880 --> 02:06.120]  There's a big article up on infowars.com with a former high-level CIA analyst predicting
[02:06.120 --> 02:09.520]  absolute violence and carnage if Trump wins.
[02:09.520 --> 02:14.920]  Even more violence if he loses because the Communist mob is going to try to take control
[02:14.920 --> 02:17.440]  of the Biden administration.
[02:17.440 --> 02:22.000]  That's why Soros and the Deep State are putting Biden in, they hope, because he's weak.
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.000]  I concur with that analysis.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  We'll be talking about that coming up next segment.
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.680]  The big thing we're going to break down right up front here today is they've tried to brand
[02:31.680 --> 02:36.400]  the Chinese Communist Wuhan virus as the European virus, as the Trump virus, as the American
[02:36.400 --> 02:37.400]  virus.
[02:37.400 --> 02:41.600]  I mean, because Trump, most of the stuff in the Woodward's book is a fraud, but Trump
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.320]  early on said, boy, it does look deadly.
[02:44.320 --> 02:46.200]  They were saying it killed 4% of people.
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.680]  We said it might actually be deadly.
[02:47.680 --> 02:48.680]  We didn't know.
[02:48.680 --> 02:53.440]  Then things changed as we learned that they had hyped it up and exaggerated it to a level
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.120]  of fraud.
[02:55.120 --> 03:00.760]  They're acting like now he's behind the virus and he killed 190,000 people when, again,
[03:00.760 --> 03:01.920]  most of those died of something else.
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.960]  It's just incredible fraud, but they're running around saying it's the end of Trump.
[03:05.960 --> 03:07.360]  He's in deep trouble.
[03:07.360 --> 03:09.560]  Here's some of the sickening press conference yesterday.
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.560]  Yes.
[03:10.560 --> 03:12.840]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.360]  Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say about
[03:17.360 --> 03:18.360]  it?
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.640]  Such a terrible question and the phraseology, I didn't lie.
[03:21.640 --> 03:23.200]  What I said is we have to be calm.
[03:23.200 --> 03:25.840]  We can't be panicked.
[03:25.840 --> 03:28.240]  I knew that the tapes were there.
[03:28.240 --> 03:33.920]  These were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls, and Bob Woodward
[03:33.920 --> 03:39.620]  is somebody that I respect just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing
[03:39.620 --> 03:43.960]  too much about his work and not caring about his work, but I thought it would be interesting
[03:43.960 --> 03:47.960]  to talk to him for a period of calls.
[03:47.960 --> 03:48.960]  So we did that.
[03:48.960 --> 03:50.240]  I don't know if it's good or bad.
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.520]  I don't even know if the book is good or bad, but certainly if he thought that was a bad
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.600]  statement, he would have reported it because he thinks that you don't want to have anybody
[04:00.600 --> 04:07.680]  that is going to suffer medically because of some fact, and he didn't report it because
[04:07.680 --> 04:08.680]  he didn't think it was good.
[04:08.680 --> 04:09.680]  Well, here's what's really going on.
[04:09.680 --> 04:15.480]  They told us 4% were going to die, then 2% then 1%, and the best numbers we've got vary,
[04:15.480 --> 04:22.760]  but it's.000 and then a few numbers after it and some areas even lower.
[04:22.760 --> 04:27.960]  Like in Australia, less than 80 people died of COVID-19 when you take out code morbidity.
[04:27.960 --> 04:29.400]  Did you hear what I just said?
[04:29.400 --> 04:32.000]  Less than 100 have died in the major island of Hawaii.
[04:32.000 --> 04:33.000]  They don't care.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.040]  They just keep hyping the fear.
[04:35.040 --> 04:38.480]  And now the flu is coming that really kills people, and they're saying, oh, oh, we're
[04:38.480 --> 04:40.320]  going to lock down over that too.
[04:40.320 --> 04:42.200]  It's never going to end, folks.
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.480]  The masks don't come off until you refuse to wear them.
[04:45.480 --> 04:48.960]  The answer is when they started beating up that woman, the Spanish police, the people
[04:48.960 --> 04:50.760]  started beating them up.
[04:50.760 --> 04:52.880]  That's the answer to communists.
[04:52.880 --> 04:53.880]  Don't submit to them.
[04:53.880 --> 04:54.880]  Stay with us.
[04:54.880 --> 05:06.080]  As of 54 days out, the globalist child molesting devil worshippers know they're in trouble
[05:06.080 --> 05:07.880]  and they know Trump's going to win in the landslides.
[05:07.880 --> 05:11.040]  They're saying they're going to contest the election and plunge the country into civil
[05:11.040 --> 05:12.040]  war.
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.520]  And they are throwing hack attacks at M4s, dirty tricks, attempts to shut us down.
[05:16.520 --> 05:17.520]  It's incredible.
[05:17.520 --> 05:22.440]  That's why now more than ever, your financial support at M4shore.com is critical.
[05:22.440 --> 05:23.760]  It's what keeps us in the game.
[05:23.760 --> 05:26.840]  We've only got a few months of backup.
[05:26.840 --> 05:30.320]  If money wasn't coming in, we'd be shut down, and that's not good.
[05:30.320 --> 05:35.200]  We need to have extra money in our coffers, people to expand in this home stretch, not
[05:35.200 --> 05:36.360]  just contract.
[05:36.360 --> 05:40.760]  We're winning, but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight.
[05:40.760 --> 05:44.440]  So I know you're going to step up, and at FullWarStore.com, we've got free shipping
[05:44.440 --> 05:47.760]  on a bunch of our best-selling items, a bunch of new items that came back in stock, we've
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.760]  got privacy pockets so your phones don't track you, great supplements, books, films, T-shirts,
[05:52.760 --> 05:53.760]  so much more.
[05:53.760 --> 06:22.760]  Get prepared and fund the M4 at M4store.com, God bless you all.
[06:24.760 --> 06:30.960]  Yeah, they try to confuse our young 18-year-olds to serve evil, to join corruption, and to
[06:30.960 --> 06:32.760]  reject God and their families.
[06:32.760 --> 06:39.160]  A lot of 18-year-olds are adults mentally, and they know how to refuse corruption.
[06:39.160 --> 06:45.760]  But what if you're three years old, you're being raped by a liberal devil worshipper?
[06:45.760 --> 06:51.360]  Well, then you have your innocence ruined for life, and statistically, you end up about
[06:51.360 --> 06:53.960]  half the time being a pedophile yourself.
[06:53.960 --> 07:01.360]  We've got articles out today, mainstream news, men raping babies on video.
[07:01.360 --> 07:06.700]  It's the new liberal trendy thing to do, and pass it around.
[07:06.700 --> 07:09.680]  And the media is defending it.
[07:09.680 --> 07:16.160]  Now, I wasn't going to cover this today because it was too disgusting until I was watching
[07:16.160 --> 07:21.040]  when I got up about 5 a.m. this morning, the Arnold Lorraine host election countdown last
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.120]  night, and I didn't know that a major movie star or actress, you name it, I've actually
[07:26.120 --> 07:32.800]  seen a few of her things, I'm a fan of her husband, Blake Lively came out and talked
[07:32.800 --> 07:35.600]  about how Hollywood is into raping newborn babies.
[07:35.600 --> 07:38.760]  Their favorite thing is when they still have the umbilical cord attached to them.
[07:38.760 --> 07:43.240]  Now, that's the kind of stuff I'm aware of from what's come out, what's come out in
[07:43.240 --> 07:47.360]  police reports over the years, snuff films, things you don't really see in the news, but
[07:47.360 --> 07:52.320]  it comes out in court, and she talks about the law enforcement she's talked to that
[07:52.320 --> 07:58.240]  witnesses these devil worshipers raping newborn babies, because they have women that specially
[07:58.240 --> 08:05.520]  breed to have the babies, and then they rape them in a satanic ritual, and you know, I'm
[08:05.520 --> 08:09.080]  sorry to have to start the show like that for you, but you know, I was wrestling with
[08:09.080 --> 08:12.640]  whether I should cover this or not, and I didn't watch her show last night, I usually
[08:12.640 --> 08:19.400]  do, and I just thought I better tell people about it.
[08:19.400 --> 08:26.600]  So we'll cover that later in this hour, but the full breakdown by Deanna Lorraine is posted
[08:26.600 --> 08:32.520]  on infowars.com, Blake Lively gives emotional speech on child pornography, the systematic
[08:32.520 --> 08:37.360]  pedophile agenda is exposing itself in the world, that's the headline that Deanna Lorraine
[08:37.360 --> 08:40.320]  gave it, it's a band on video.
[08:40.320 --> 08:47.000]  So this is all coming out, and without even intending to cover this today, I just, I sent
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.840]  them the video, but I probably wasn't going to cover it, I had two articles in my stack
[08:51.840 --> 08:56.920]  about raping babies, and videotaping it, and passing it around, and I thought, you know,
[08:56.920 --> 09:00.760]  I better cover it.
[09:00.760 --> 09:03.440]  That's without looking for this, it's just everywhere.
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.200]  Can you imagine the police that have to look at this stuff?
[09:08.200 --> 09:14.920]  I've talked to some of them, and General Flynn's lawyer has talked to them, and it is horrific
[09:14.920 --> 09:21.120]  to have to look at a bunch of people that look like Brian Stelter with big demon smiles
[09:21.120 --> 09:24.680]  on their faces, doing these type of things, I'm not saying Brian Stelter doesn't, I'm
[09:24.680 --> 09:28.640]  just saying they look like Brian Stelter.
[09:28.640 --> 09:34.240]  God help us, just absolutely God help us, the bottomless pit, means there's no bottom
[09:34.240 --> 09:47.040]  to it, there's no level that they won't sink to, they like it, they enjoy it, oh, and by
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.640]  the way, they don't just rape these babies, they torture the living hell out of them
[09:51.640 --> 09:59.120]  and kill them, so that's all coming up, and you know, we can't let this get us down, there's
[09:59.120 --> 10:08.440]  big articles out today that the already record suicides have now broken other records, and
[10:08.440 --> 10:12.760]  the number of people considering suicides broken records, and when you go look at who
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.800]  they are, they're military, they're police, they're Christians, they're hard working,
[10:17.800 --> 10:23.760]  white men is the largest group who are giving up on society, but it's black men, brown men,
[10:23.760 --> 10:29.520]  it's everybody, it's men, and they kill themselves because they can't handle the immorality.
[10:29.520 --> 10:38.280]  You need to stand up for the children, you need to prosecute and go after the globalist,
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.240]  you want to politically and economically and then when the time comes, if they keep pushing
[10:42.240 --> 10:49.320]  this physical stuff, physically, we make them pay, we don't pay, you don't kill yourself,
[10:49.320 --> 10:56.040]  you throw yourself at the enemy, but people with conscience are the ones killing themselves
[10:56.040 --> 11:02.400]  because they can't handle it, don't kill yourself, that's a coward's way out, and I'm not blaming
[11:02.400 --> 11:07.760]  folks that do it, I'm just saying don't, you fight corruption, you get involved going up
[11:07.760 --> 11:11.680]  against the enemy, you're not going to be depressed anymore, you're going to have that
[11:11.680 --> 11:19.640]  hunger that an attack dog has when it's going after the enemy, given to that God's spirit
[11:19.640 --> 11:25.640]  of vengeance because vengeance is mine, say it to the Lord, but God has instruments of
[11:25.640 --> 11:32.760]  vengeance, so stop caring what people think, stop caring about the world saying you don't
[11:32.760 --> 11:37.720]  have status, stop caring about how nice your car is or, you know, if your wife's broken
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.680]  up with you and your kids got problems, just stay in the fight, don't blow your head off,
[11:42.680 --> 11:47.960]  whether you're black or white, old or young, we'll talk about some of that, but what I'll
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.400]  do is start the next segment is I'll get into the huge news of them pinning COVID-19 on
[11:52.400 --> 11:58.200]  the president and twisting something Bob Woodward said, that oh, Trump thought the virus was
[11:58.200 --> 12:05.280]  deadly back in February and March, well, the news said it was killing 4% of people, that's
[12:05.280 --> 12:10.640]  ultra deadly, turned out it was a fraction of a fraction of a fraction, and then Trump
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.840]  changed his view, properly so, I said, looks like it's overblown, but boy, you better get
[12:15.840 --> 12:21.000]  ready, but the scenes of end of the world, we were witnessing that we now know as a major
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.040]  put on in communist China that shut down Hong Kong and Taiwan, and GZPings basically admitted
[12:27.040 --> 12:32.360]  that now, so that's all coming up today and just incredible developments, Democrats caught
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.320]  on tape saying nothing opens up until after the election, and it's still not gonna open
[12:37.320 --> 12:43.520]  up, once these cult leaders get a mask on your face, they never take them off, and Fauci
[12:43.520 --> 12:48.840]  says Americans need to hunker down for fall and winter, and no, it's never gonna end,
[12:48.840 --> 12:56.360]  oh, he's such a little lion piece of crap, and there's some other good news, big tech
[12:56.360 --> 13:02.680]  companies reconsider relying on SPLC after hearing about scandals and terror attacks
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.520]  that they run, and their billions of bucks offshore, and how they're run by foreign
[13:06.520 --> 13:15.480]  intelligence agencies, SPLC is in Google, Facebook, Twitter, they run all the moderation,
[13:15.480 --> 13:21.800]  hundreds of thousands of people trained by them, that's all coming up in a lot of campaign
[13:21.800 --> 13:28.600]  trail news, and like I said, if you think 10-year-old girls twerking in front of men who then let
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.600]  them commit crimes because they're sexually attracted to them, it's so disgusting, if
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.200]  you think that's bad, they're distracting with this show Cuties, they've got stuff on
[13:37.200 --> 13:44.600]  Netflix where, again, 10-year-old boys are having sex with full-grown men, pedophilia
[13:44.600 --> 13:50.200]  just absolutely in your face, and they use something like Cuties that's bad, but it's
[13:50.200 --> 13:55.080]  like low-level compared to the hardcore stuff that's on there, that's how they distract,
[13:55.080 --> 14:01.400]  and then that ties into all the hardcore stuff, and we also have the NFL.
[14:01.400 --> 14:09.160]  The Texans refuse to even take the field during the Star Spangled Banner, and the other team
[14:09.160 --> 14:15.920]  took their knees in all this crap for diversity because America's bad, then Lulu Lemon said
[14:15.920 --> 14:24.120]  capitalism in America's bad, and guess where they make their stuff, China.
[14:24.120 --> 14:30.480]  It's like saying Stalin comes out against Communism or something, it's ridiculous, these companies
[14:30.480 --> 14:34.960]  are so evil, so bad, and then we wonder why a bunch of followers, a bunch of NFL players
[14:34.960 --> 14:40.960]  are told by their corporate sponsors do that, so they do it for money, money, money, money,
[14:40.960 --> 14:41.960]  money, money.
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.160]  Well then don't give the NFL your money, it's been fake forever.
[14:45.160 --> 14:51.400]  Oh, the games are real, but it's all empty, it's all a joke, and it robs manhood.
[14:51.400 --> 14:56.160]  Everybody thinks boxing is manhood, or the NFL is manhood, or baseball is manhood.
[14:56.160 --> 14:59.600]  No, that's a diversion, that's entertainment.
[14:59.600 --> 15:03.800]  Manhood's taking care of your children, working hard, loving God, standing up for what's right,
[15:03.800 --> 15:09.680]  having moral courage, and these people in sports are the worst of the worst of the worst.
[15:09.680 --> 15:13.480]  They don't have moral integrity, they don't have honor, they don't have strength, and
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.960]  they work for a system of true slave masters that run slave camps.
[15:18.960 --> 15:26.600]  Nike is the biggest apparel maker in areas known to have Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.200]  slave labor, so does Lululemon.
[15:30.200 --> 15:34.800]  But they tell you, decolonize gender, white people are bad, while they let the chai comms
[15:34.800 --> 15:36.360]  run the slave camps.
[15:36.360 --> 15:40.720]  This is an evil organization, they're all evil, because they're all financed by the
[15:40.720 --> 15:46.240]  big megabanks that are one mind, one satanic vision to destroy you and your family.
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.240]  All these subgroups want the loans, so they all follow the orders.
[15:51.240 --> 15:53.640]  They're your enemy, period, period.
[15:53.640 --> 15:58.320]  We'll be right back, stay with us in FullWars.com tomorrow since today.
[15:58.320 --> 16:01.880]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening, and I point out that the globalist
[16:01.880 --> 16:04.240]  are a eugenics death cult, because it's true.
[16:04.240 --> 16:08.320]  I don't say it to scare you, a lot of people say, man, this show is dark.
[16:08.320 --> 16:11.760]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it.
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.720]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the NWO propagandists are saying, they have
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.560]  reasons to sell this garbage to the general public.
[16:19.560 --> 16:24.320]  But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant, they've all written detailed
[16:24.320 --> 16:29.080]  blueprints of this plan, and more and more being honest about it.
[16:29.080 --> 16:33.880]  Because there comes a point where as David Ike says, they have to stop hiding it and
[16:33.880 --> 16:34.880]  start selling it.
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.600]  So we're at the point of the emergence now, and it's coming out in the open, and some
[16:40.600 --> 16:46.080]  people under Mass.com syndrome are going to submit to any level of tyranny, but others
[16:46.080 --> 16:47.720]  are going to fight.
[16:47.720 --> 16:52.240]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it and be
[16:52.240 --> 16:53.240]  okay.
[16:53.240 --> 16:58.200]  No, this thing is post-humanism, exterminism, research what that is.
[16:58.200 --> 17:03.920]  Ever wondered why big tech acts in unison to create monopolies and are so incredibly
[17:03.920 --> 17:09.240]  anti-human, love to censor people, love to cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes
[17:09.240 --> 17:10.240]  and take care of ships?
[17:10.240 --> 17:11.440]  Well, it's very simple.
[17:11.440 --> 17:16.240]  The first computers ever created were created by Thomas Watts, the founder and owner of IBM,
[17:16.240 --> 17:17.920]  to carry out eugenics.
[17:17.920 --> 17:20.040]  And they helped run the death camp to Nazi Germany.
[17:20.040 --> 17:22.360]  That's what the tattoos were on the slaves' arms.
[17:22.360 --> 17:24.280]  They would decide who lived and who died.
[17:24.280 --> 17:29.240]  So from the beginning, it's been about creating monopolies, cornering markets, and making
[17:29.240 --> 17:30.600]  humans obsolete.
[17:30.600 --> 17:34.400]  The same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have enough protein fat in it to make
[17:34.400 --> 17:35.400]  your child's brain small.
[17:35.400 --> 17:39.400]  The same people that said, put babies in cribs separate from their mothers.
[17:39.400 --> 17:41.800]  The lower IQ is about 20 points on average as well.
[17:41.800 --> 17:47.320]  These are hardcore eugenics, survival of the fittest, social Darwinists, grow up world,
[17:47.320 --> 17:52.080]  admit the truth, quit being soft as much, let it be, love will run your lives.
[17:52.080 --> 17:53.600]  They are your mortal enemies.
[17:53.600 --> 17:55.280]  They want you dead.
[17:55.280 --> 18:00.560]  Do you understand that?
[18:00.560 --> 18:07.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:07.560 --> 18:19.560]  52 days out.
[18:19.560 --> 18:20.800]  It is September 11th.
[18:20.800 --> 18:21.800]  The year is 2020.
[18:21.800 --> 18:27.360]  Thank you for joining us on this live teleprompter free Friday edition.
[18:27.360 --> 18:30.840]  So the media is beating the drum, we knew they would do it.
[18:30.840 --> 18:33.400]  They were always going to blame the virus on Trump.
[18:33.400 --> 18:40.000]  The UN said months ago that the pandemic is over in China, the pandemic is over in Europe.
[18:40.000 --> 18:46.240]  It was never an epidemic, meaning enough numbers of people actually getting sick and dying.
[18:46.240 --> 18:50.320]  It was a pandemic, meaning a lot of people were testing positive.
[18:50.320 --> 18:55.280]  But they wanted to turn Europe and turn other areas back on.
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.960]  But they're never going to say that America can be turned back on.
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.640]  Even if Biden gets in, the plan is to lock us down.
[19:02.640 --> 19:05.080]  I'm going to show you some of those documents and some of those admissions.
[19:05.080 --> 19:10.560]  So it's all semantical manipulation, just like I've gone out, Penn and Teller have done
[19:10.560 --> 19:12.760]  it, many others have done it.
[19:12.760 --> 19:14.440]  Mark Dice has done it.
[19:14.440 --> 19:20.200]  You go out to any group, university students, adults, and you say, the hydrogen monoxide
[19:20.200 --> 19:23.600]  is running off into the creeks and rivers.
[19:23.600 --> 19:26.200]  It's a big problem, we'd like to ban it.
[19:26.200 --> 19:30.760]  Almost everyone signs a petition to ban dihydrogen monoxide, it's water.
[19:30.760 --> 19:36.520]  They'll also sign a petition to ban salt when you use the technical name because to most
[19:36.520 --> 19:39.240]  people science sounds scary.
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.520]  That's why Fauci says trust the science because everything he's saying is a lie and it's not
[19:43.520 --> 19:49.520]  science and the UN and big media and big tech censor, medical doctors saying you're not
[19:49.520 --> 19:51.320]  allowed to question the UN.
[19:51.320 --> 19:58.680]  The essence of the scientific method is being challenged, your hypothesis, your postulates.
[19:58.680 --> 20:01.040]  But again, this is war on reality.
[20:01.040 --> 20:05.320]  So here's the president being asked about why he lied to the people.
[20:05.320 --> 20:06.320]  Here it is.
[20:06.320 --> 20:07.320]  Yes.
[20:07.320 --> 20:08.320]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[20:08.320 --> 20:13.440]  Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?
[20:13.440 --> 20:16.560]  Such a terrible question and the phraseology.
[20:16.560 --> 20:17.840]  I didn't lie.
[20:17.840 --> 20:22.040]  What I said is we have to become, we can't be panicked.
[20:22.040 --> 20:28.200]  I knew that the tapes were, these were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls
[20:28.200 --> 20:34.200]  and Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect and it just goes on from there.
[20:34.200 --> 20:39.600]  So we're talking six months ago, they're saying two to 4% are going to die.
[20:39.600 --> 20:43.800]  And Trump's like, yeah, looks like it's nasty stuff, but then he came out and said, be calm
[20:43.800 --> 20:44.800]  or they'll be fine.
[20:44.800 --> 20:45.800]  We got therapeutics.
[20:45.800 --> 20:50.920]  It was totally exaggerated, a scam, a fraud, a con job, not a hoax.
[20:50.920 --> 20:52.040]  The virus is real.
[20:52.040 --> 20:53.240]  It can kill people.
[20:53.240 --> 20:55.800]  Any virus can kill you if you don't have the right vitamins and nutrients.
[20:55.800 --> 20:58.320]  That's why they're called essential.
[20:58.320 --> 21:04.400]  You don't have vitamin C. You can put somebody in a pod with no bacteria or viruses and they'll
[21:04.400 --> 21:09.840]  die usually within three months with no vitamin C. It's essential.
[21:09.840 --> 21:11.360]  Same thing with D. And I know I keep harping.
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.760]  I know you know that the fall and winter is coming.
[21:13.760 --> 21:17.840]  They're going to have real deaths for people locked inside, getting no vitamin D3 from
[21:17.840 --> 21:20.520]  the sun and not having C and zinc.
[21:20.520 --> 21:28.040]  So you want to beat these murderers, tell everyone you know, zinc, C, and D3.
[21:28.040 --> 21:29.040]  Like your life depends on it.
[21:29.040 --> 21:31.160]  We're going to get around to some fact sheets.
[21:31.160 --> 21:32.160]  We're going to get up this weekend.
[21:32.160 --> 21:36.200]  I'm a little bit behind on it with medical doctor quotes and factoids so you can print
[21:36.200 --> 21:38.120]  them off at info wars and share them with people.
[21:38.120 --> 21:42.720]  Just have like a one page with stuff on each side, hand those out there, put them on doors,
[21:42.720 --> 21:43.840]  put them on cars.
[21:43.840 --> 21:44.840]  You do that.
[21:44.840 --> 21:46.960]  It'll save hundreds of thousands of lives.
[21:46.960 --> 21:51.880]  And these murderers won't have those deaths to then use to take all of our freedoms.
[21:51.880 --> 21:53.320]  So it's a win-win.
[21:53.320 --> 21:55.520]  But let's continue.
[21:55.520 --> 21:56.520]  Here's Fauci.
[21:56.520 --> 22:01.080]  Dr. Fauci says Americans need to hunker down for fall and winter and that never shake hands
[22:01.080 --> 22:03.200]  again and this is never going to end.
[22:03.200 --> 22:04.200]  Total fraud.
[22:04.200 --> 22:05.960]  But China, everybody else is over business.
[22:05.960 --> 22:12.840]  Meanwhile, LA health director says schools won't reopen until after election.
[22:12.840 --> 22:16.120]  James Woods tweeted out and said, man, look how unhealthy she looks.
[22:16.120 --> 22:19.960]  And the, and Snopes said it was a fake photo, which it wasn't, it was from Getty Images,
[22:19.960 --> 22:21.440]  but Snopes is God.
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.720]  And they said it was fake.
[22:22.720 --> 22:26.320]  No, that's what these health directors really look like.
[22:26.320 --> 22:30.640]  And folks have put together montages of them all over the world looking like she could
[22:30.640 --> 22:32.760]  star in a zombie movie right now.
[22:32.760 --> 22:33.760]  No makeup needed.
[22:33.760 --> 22:39.360]  And she looks like she just climbed out of a, out of a coffin.
[22:39.360 --> 22:40.360]  Absolutely incredible.
[22:40.360 --> 22:45.240]  And we're going to get to more of that coming up, but let's continue.
[22:45.240 --> 22:51.680]  So Trump says he didn't lie about virus bombshell because he said, oh yeah, it looks really
[22:51.680 --> 22:58.240]  nasty six months ago when we were seeing images of the apocalypse in China.
[22:58.240 --> 23:02.000]  Deadly stuff from his own words bring focus back to virus.
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.200]  But now we know it isn't deadly.
[23:04.200 --> 23:06.880]  It's very, very rare to make somebody sick or kill somebody.
[23:06.880 --> 23:09.160]  Almost everybody is asymptomatic.
[23:09.160 --> 23:14.320]  So they think you're illogical and you don't know the difference of six, seven months ago
[23:14.320 --> 23:15.920]  versus what the president says now.
[23:15.920 --> 23:18.320]  And they're like, look at people in his rallies.
[23:18.320 --> 23:22.440]  They're not wearing masks, but then it's okay, black lives matter for them not to wear masks.
[23:22.440 --> 23:25.360]  It's all fraud.
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.160]  But here's some of the original information on it.
[23:29.160 --> 23:33.520]  Coronavirus now a pandemic, how does that differ from an epidemic or outbreak?
[23:33.520 --> 23:35.280]  That was months and months ago.
[23:35.280 --> 23:37.160]  That's Yahoo News.
[23:37.160 --> 23:39.920]  Well an epidemic means you're getting sick and dying.
[23:39.920 --> 23:43.480]  Ep pandemic just means a lot of people have the virus, which again, most of it's false
[23:43.480 --> 23:45.480]  positives.
[23:45.480 --> 23:48.680]  Coronavirus clinically no longer exists in Italy, doctors says.
[23:48.680 --> 23:57.000]  That was back in June, COVID-19 will not soon lose status as epidemic under the CDC update.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.760]  They changed it saying no one needs to be sick now to call an epidemic.
[24:01.760 --> 24:06.320]  Who no longer uses pandemic category, but COVID-19 is still an emergency.
[24:06.320 --> 24:11.000]  So the UN is not even calling it a global pandemic, meaning a lot of people have it.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  But in America, we still call it that because again, it's only targeting us to keep us locked
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.680]  down.
[24:18.680 --> 24:20.800]  So that's how these scams work.
[24:20.800 --> 24:28.440]  Meanwhile, the CDC cloth mask used to stop COVID-19 will not stop wildfire smoke inhalation.
[24:28.440 --> 24:32.560]  Even though the virus is much smaller than the average smoke particular, it's all fraud.
[24:32.560 --> 24:36.120]  The mask don't protect you, it's all pure crap.
[24:36.120 --> 24:42.240]  The medical mask are so the doctor doesn't breathe anything he has onto an open patient
[24:42.240 --> 24:47.000]  having surgery and that's a good thing so they don't cough or spit or sneeze onto you.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.800]  They've also got advisers to protect their eyes of their sawing bone or whatever.
[24:51.800 --> 24:56.040]  But the idea of walking around with gloves is just as dirty as your hands and wearing
[24:56.040 --> 24:57.040]  these stupid masks.
[24:57.040 --> 25:01.480]  It's all placebo.
[25:01.480 --> 25:02.480]  But here she is.
[25:02.480 --> 25:03.480]  We got the audio.
[25:03.480 --> 25:10.120]  LA public health director caught on tape saying schools will stay shut until after the election.
[25:10.120 --> 25:17.080]  KTLA 600 has the audio, but again, all these photos show what she really looks like.
[25:17.080 --> 25:23.680]  She looks like she has 0% fat and has been in a concentration camp under Hitler, but
[25:23.680 --> 25:28.040]  I have the Associated Press attacking saying it's doctored.
[25:28.040 --> 25:29.040]  She looks great.
[25:29.040 --> 25:34.720]  She looks super, super healthy, so they'll edit it to make LA County health director
[25:34.720 --> 25:39.360]  appear sick really go watch video over press conference a few days ago.
[25:39.360 --> 25:41.720]  She looks even worse.
[25:41.720 --> 25:44.680]  I've never seen someone walking around looks this bad.
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.320]  She looks like she's starving more than little African children that are in a huge drought
[25:49.320 --> 25:50.880]  and that die.
[25:50.880 --> 25:54.280]  Again, World War Z, no makeup needed.
[25:54.280 --> 25:57.600]  She can be a zombie right now.
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.120]  But oh, Snopes says, Snopes is God.
[26:01.120 --> 26:08.040]  Snopes says she looks like Marilyn Monroe, false claim photo of LA County health director
[26:08.040 --> 26:11.040]  Barbara Ferrer shows her looking unwell.
[26:11.040 --> 26:15.240]  No, just look at her from a Getty's photo on info wars.
[26:15.240 --> 26:18.840]  Why she looks great.
[26:18.840 --> 26:19.840]  Here's some more of these women.
[26:19.840 --> 26:23.200]  Document cam shot, please.
[26:23.200 --> 26:27.920]  Here's Dr. Beth Bell, CDC looks like she's like the same space alien or something.
[26:27.920 --> 26:32.760]  Look at this woman, Belgian health minister, Maggie de Blas, boy, didn't know job of the
[26:32.760 --> 26:38.120]  hut out of sister, Barbara Garcia, director of San Francisco Department of Public Health,
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.920]  looks like Nadler's sister, San Francisco Public Health.
[26:42.920 --> 26:45.520]  All these guys look like demons.
[26:45.520 --> 26:48.760]  Why do they all look like they're dying?
[26:48.760 --> 26:56.280]  Because you reap what you sow and those that live by medical tyranny die by medical tyranny.
[26:56.280 --> 27:03.560]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands, but if you
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.800]  were a person just 200 years ago and you saw that you think it was magic, you wouldn't
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.200]  even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them.
[27:11.200 --> 27:15.920]  So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of the spirit.
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.160]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal, they'll
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.040]  have to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[27:24.040 --> 27:28.640]  They're following magnetic lines, they have magnetic cells in their brains, we now know
[27:28.640 --> 27:31.720]  side of what's going on, there's even a lot more than that.
[27:31.720 --> 27:35.480]  So when we talk about the spirit, we're talking about all the dark matter, we're talking about
[27:35.480 --> 27:37.560]  all the things you don't understand but we know it's there.
[27:37.560 --> 27:42.000]  And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system, that's what's
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people and that's how this
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.440]  entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a consciousness manipulated
[27:52.440 --> 27:55.720]  device of space-time continuum.
[27:55.720 --> 28:04.040]  I don't want to be right about this prediction, in fact it's not a prediction, it is a forecast
[28:04.040 --> 28:09.240]  if we continue down the economic road we're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns
[28:09.240 --> 28:13.520]  and the structure of productivity, it will continue to accelerate these ripple effects
[28:13.520 --> 28:17.600]  that are breaking down supply chains that will storm tens of millions of additional
[28:17.600 --> 28:22.760]  people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure that's been built,
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.400]  it will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper
[28:27.400 --> 28:29.760]  debt which we're being maneuvered into.
[28:29.760 --> 28:35.640]  So I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute
[28:35.640 --> 28:41.400]  the people that launched the giant COVID scam, the giant COVID con game, there's really
[28:41.400 --> 28:45.520]  just a big power grab but in case we can't reverse all this we better start digging
[28:45.520 --> 28:49.200]  in and getting storable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name
[28:49.200 --> 28:55.120]  of their game is to make us dependent on them so get self-sufficient now in FullWars.com.
[28:55.120 --> 28:59.440]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[28:59.440 --> 29:06.000]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species
[29:06.000 --> 29:12.160]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats and that if we just sit
[29:12.160 --> 29:16.080]  back and enjoy the ride everything will be great but then they tell us that humans are
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.080]  obsolete, not essential, that we're bad for the earth and we need to be phased out.
[29:20.080 --> 29:26.600]  So they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive
[29:26.600 --> 29:30.960]  living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[29:30.960 --> 29:36.200]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is
[29:36.200 --> 29:41.520]  that we control our environment, we build our own environments, we create our own systems,
[29:41.520 --> 29:48.480]  we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims but instead
[29:48.480 --> 29:53.000]  we're acting like animals and the globalists play the part of humans and us as cattle and
[29:53.000 --> 29:58.400]  that's the trick.
[29:58.400 --> 30:23.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:23.400 --> 30:49.000]  A
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  Strip.
[30:51.000 --> 30:54.000]  Let me see you strip.
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  Oh, we're gonna get stripped.
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.000]  Let me see you strip.
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.000]  Let me see you without your television.
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  Alright, let's get right into it.
[31:11.000 --> 31:15.000]  Let me hear you make decisions.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  Without your television.
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  Without your television.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  Alright, my friends, here is the final equation.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  There is an extremely predatory group of people that go out of their way
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  and even destroy their own self-interest and their own children
[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  to dumb people down, mutate people, poison people,
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  and turn us against each other,
[31:37.000 --> 31:40.000]  setting us up for an end of planet event.
[31:40.000 --> 31:46.000]  Now, the Bible says an off-world entity was marooned here by the Creator
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  and because we have free will,
[31:50.000 --> 31:54.000]  that entity is allowed to try to trick us to destroy ourselves.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  He was cast out of heaven.
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  And now all the mathematics and all the science show all these dimensions
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.000]  above, below, and around us in the multiverses.
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  And I can tell you, as I've been telling you for 20-plus years,
[32:14.000 --> 32:18.000]  none of the globalists, not the Rockefellers, not the Rothschilds,
[32:18.000 --> 32:23.000]  not Elon Musk, none of them believe that there's not other entities
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  and a controller that they're rebelling against,
[32:26.000 --> 32:29.000]  that they believe they're going to break free from.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  And you notice Elon Musk came out about six months after I was on Joe Rogan
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  three years ago on episode 9-11,
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.000]  and he basically repeated everything I said about the establishment and what they believe.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.000]  This is what they believe.
[32:43.000 --> 32:47.000]  So when I tell you all of this, it's very, very important for you
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  to not just think that I'm here making this up.
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  Yes, it's fantastical. Yes, it's crazy.
[32:53.000 --> 32:59.000]  But until you pull back and look at it, it's not human.
[32:59.000 --> 33:02.000]  This is not being done for us.
[33:06.000 --> 33:09.000]  And so a lot of people go along with the system
[33:09.000 --> 33:12.000]  thinking that having a bigger house, having more money,
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.000]  having a better car, that that's the final symbol of success.
[33:16.000 --> 33:21.000]  And it's not. You have to understand that we have this ancient species that we come from
[33:21.000 --> 33:26.000]  into the future and maintaining that species' integrity is the most important thing
[33:26.000 --> 33:35.000]  because it is cultural, spiritual death to allow that chain to be broken.
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  And it gets into the laws of nature and the fact that things come in threes
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  and a lot of understanding that I've not read in books,
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  but that I have come to know.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  And it's extremely important that people know this information
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  and it's why they want us off the air.
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  But they metaphysically have to be very careful how they do it.
[33:57.000 --> 34:00.000]  They need to trick us into sabotaging ourselves
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  or trick someone else into killing us.
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.000]  They themselves are blocked by God's rules from moving against us.
[34:07.000 --> 34:13.000]  And moving against you, if you understand that spiritual dominion,
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.000]  that spiritual deed that you have over the enemy.
[34:19.000 --> 34:23.000]  So everything the enemy does is to hurt us and to make us depressed
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  and make us kill ourselves and make us give up.
[34:27.000 --> 34:35.000]  But if you realize that that is all put on in a rope-a-dope and a scam,
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  and just open the connection to God and the infinite
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  and just ask God to defend you,
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  then the gates of hell will not prevail against us.
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.000]  But you look at the people that serve Satan,
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  Soros and the Clintons and all these other people,
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  they know what they're doing and they've been put in power because they're weak.
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  They're not elites. We call them elites.
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.000]  That's the name they have themselves. They're not.
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.000]  They are jokes.
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  They are slaves.
[35:13.000 --> 35:22.000]  And the people that follow them
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  at a primitive level believe that there's a social contract,
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  even though they don't know what that is, that term,
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  and they believe these are leaders that really care about them.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  And it's up to us that are leaders to understand that the people
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  following Satan's plan are slaves,
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  and they're trying to lead other people into slavery,
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  and that we have a responsibility not to just sit there and complain about this,
[35:41.000 --> 35:49.000]  but to challenge the enemy and to occupy and to conquer the land,
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  metaphysically.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  So I'm going to stop preaching and get back into all the news
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  because there's plenty of it today.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  And I want to get into the history of 9-11 and where all that's going
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  and so much more.
[35:59.000 --> 36:05.000]  But think about the gaslighting, the brainwashing of Nadler
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  saying no such thing as Antifa,
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  or that Antifa are peaceful,
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  or they're calling these guys that we're trying to chase down
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  and kill written house victims and heroes who survived a massacre.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  I mean, that's all upside down world.
[36:22.000 --> 36:25.000]  But look at Nadler.
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  I mean, if you chose one out of 50,000 people
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  to physically look like a cartoon character,
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  the image of weakness, it's him.
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  But it's because the spirit shines out through the genetics
[36:39.000 --> 36:47.000]  and manifest in that.
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.000]  That's the enemy's top general.
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  That's the slave.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  And look at this woman, L.A.,
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  public health director caught on tape saying
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  schools will stay shut until after the election.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.000]  Well, of course they will.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of her saying that to KT.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  L.A., God, here it is.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  We don't realistically anticipate that we would be moving
[37:17.000 --> 37:22.000]  either tier two or to reopening K through 12 schools,
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  at least through, at least until after the election,
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  after, you know, in early November.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  Now, you can type in her name, Barbara Ferrer,
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.000]  and the photos are so horrific.
[37:36.000 --> 37:47.000]  I mean, she looks like my grandmother's dead body at 92.
[37:47.000 --> 37:54.000]  And Snoop says she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
[37:54.000 --> 37:59.000]  Now, imagine that level of gaslighting that they say,
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  Getty's photos are fake.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  And all we're saying is, why do all these health directors,
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  there's a real photo of her.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  That's a real photo of the L.A. health director, Barbara Ferrer,
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  and then that's what James Woods did.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  James Woods then morphs it into her.
[38:16.000 --> 38:17.000]  What a horrible person.
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  No, no, the truth is, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  that's a real video still that James Woods put up.
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  That's what she looks like.
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  I mean, you wouldn't take advice from her about a car,
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  about medicine.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  You wouldn't take advice from her.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  I mean, lady, are you okay?
[38:35.000 --> 38:44.000]  Are you stage four terminal cancer?
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  I mean, I've seen a lot of my dead family laying there
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  when they're dead, and she looks worse than all of them.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.000]  The very worst.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  She looks worse than all the dead bodies I've ever seen.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  And the reason I'm assessing over this is,
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  they're telling you, look at her.
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.000]  She's beautiful.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  They all go around and they look at all the other
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  health department photos of these people,
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  and they almost all look like they came from some type
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  of hell-raiser dimension.
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  And it's because, folks, these are the types of garbage
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  that want to force inoculate you.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  These are the types of garbage that Soros puts in.
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  He didn't just put in district attorneys all over the country.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  He put these people in.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  This is who Bill Gates puts in.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  They're coming for you because they're already dead inside.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  They want you to die now.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  They want to stick it in you.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  They want to stick their metal proboscis into your body
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  and attack your DNA and turn off your eighth chromosome
[39:47.000 --> 40:12.000]  so you can join them, join their guide.
[40:18.000 --> 40:30.000]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  As you can see, all the check boxes of tyranny
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  are being marked carefully.
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  Every eye dotted, every T crossed.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  A total societal vertical integration takeover,
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  medical tyranny, total surveillance.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  The big tech heads, on average, have had their wealth
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  cook up 35% in the last eight months.
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Everyone is being forced onto their system
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  to post-human robot takeover.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  You're being made obsolete.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  In Germany, in Australia, in Canada,
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  and now even in Ohio, every blue state,
[41:01.000 --> 41:06.000]  every blue city is announcing that they are establishing
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  emergency COVID centers for people that refuse to be tested
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  or people that are tested but refuse to stay in place
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  while the results are coming back
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  This, of course, is all based on the tests
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed to be so.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  This is a power grab.
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  And every blue area, I use the term blue
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  as if in the US for blue for Democrats, red for Republicans,
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  And they are using this as their cover
[41:47.000 --> 41:48.000]  for an authoritarian takeover
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  because they know the world's waiting to them.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  It's a very simple equation. It's illegal.
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  We must resist it.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  We've always had a pledge from me,
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  and it's that I'll come to you with the truth,
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  at least as good as my human temporal truth can get
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  because, as the Bible says, we all see through a rose-colored
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  darkly kind of a foggy lens that distorts
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  what we actually can perceive so that everything we do
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  is actually a fallen sin.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  Everything we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  So when I tell you I'm telling you the truth,
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  it's the best truth this fallen creature's got.
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  But I'll tell you, it's all I got.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  And when I tell you that this country and the world
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  is under a major satanic threat,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  you don't need me to tell you that.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  You can look out the window.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  You can look into your own family.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  You can turn on the news. You can see it.
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  But you've got this commitment.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  I do recognize the truth of God, and so do you.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  And I want to keep InfoWars in the main position
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  to fight, and it only happens when you support
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  what you've been doing.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  So again, I thank you.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  But go to InfoWarsTour.com, buy the products,
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  spread the word, because that's how we're going to win.
[42:53.000 --> 43:18.000]  And I thank you all.
[43:23.000 --> 43:49.000]  Thank you.
[43:49.000 --> 43:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[44:19.000 --> 44:39.000]  We are back live, my friends.
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  This is old Kenny Rogers.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  Bring us in.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  All right, I've only covered one stack of news.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  I didn't even cover all of that stack,
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  but it's the biggest stack.
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  Let me do this.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  Let me get into the pedophile stuff,
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  even though I don't want to,
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.000]  and I know you don't want to hear this either,
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  but we have to do it.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  Because they want to slowly bring this out
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.000]  and desensitize this so that we just give into it.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Instead, we need to get enraged, angry,
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  focused, and expose them and use the pain
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  to save these children.
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  Because, believe me, I could study 10 hours a day
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  and not know one tenth of what's going on.
[45:25.000 --> 45:26.000]  It's so massive.
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  I mean, it's just, it's the total satanic takeover.
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  Of course, they want our children.
[45:31.000 --> 45:32.000]  Of course, they want our future.
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  Of course, that's what these demons want to target.
[45:36.000 --> 45:40.000]  And it's a satanic invasion.
[45:40.000 --> 45:41.000]  And I get it.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  It makes me want to run to a farm somewhere
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  and try to buy 100 acres and just never leave it.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  They're going to come to your farm, folks.
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  You're not going to get away.
[45:51.000 --> 45:52.000]  Believe me, I know what you're thinking,
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  because I'm thinking the exact same thing.
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.000]  I'm not judging you.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  You think I want to be on air?
[45:56.000 --> 45:57.000]  You think I want to sit around in Austin, Texas?
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  You think I want to fight these people?
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.000]  I want to be away from them.
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  But that's not how it works.
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  You know, we're supposed to be like Christ.
[46:06.000 --> 46:07.000]  I'm comparing ourselves to Christ,
[46:07.000 --> 46:08.000]  but be Christ-like.
[46:08.000 --> 46:11.000]  And you think Christ wanted to beam into the middle of all that
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  and then be tortured and go through all that hell
[46:13.000 --> 46:16.000]  and take on all the sins and do something we couldn't even imagine?
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  No, we have to be Christ-like.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  And so, you know, I almost want to apologize
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  getting into this on air.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  But it has to be done.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  And again, we have a lot of great TV affiliates
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  pick us up in radio stations.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  And a couple of years ago, they would call up
[46:32.000 --> 46:37.000]  the affiliate director, John Harmon and Scott Bronson.
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.000]  And they'd say, hey, you really can't read
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  that police report on air.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  That's not for even adult audiences.
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  And I would instruct them to say, oh, yeah,
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  Mr. Jones agrees that this is happening to children.
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.000]  And people kind of got it.
[46:54.000 --> 46:55.000]  They're like, yeah, I guess.
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.000]  I mean, we show videos of drag queen pedophile time
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.000]  where men have glitter on their genitals.
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  You know, the stations call up and they go,
[47:06.000 --> 47:07.000]  you just not say penis.
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  You think I want to say that?
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.000]  You think I want to look at a guy in Austin
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  with a huge genitals with glitter on it,
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  with little kids hugging him?
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  It's pedophilia out the open.
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.000]  I got children.
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  You think I like that?
[47:24.000 --> 47:25.000]  I get it.
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.000]  It shouldn't be on air.
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  I shouldn't air where I'm about to air.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  But I should, shouldn't I?
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  Because if adults, they know what they're doing,
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  the psychologists know, if adults,
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.000]  they can make us just give up and go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  Then they got the feel, don't they?
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  If they can run us off because we're scared
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  to engage and face what they're doing,
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  well, how do you expect the cops to go in
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  and get all the snuff film videos and watch them
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  and then go track down who did it and then bring it forward
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  and then deal with the powerful people behind the folks
[48:02.000 --> 48:03.000]  that are doing all this?
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  How do you expect the cops to watch this stuff
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  that's 100 times worse than I'm about to show you?
[48:08.000 --> 48:13.000]  When the pedophiles and the perverts are on TV
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  at city councils saying we're going to get your kids,
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  we're grooming them.
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  So I'm not up here lecturing our listeners or viewers
[48:21.000 --> 48:22.000]  or TV stations.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  I am torn by this as well.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  But I think we've all come to the consensus
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  that we have to face this, no matter how horrible it is.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  Don't just stick a gun in your head
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  and get out of here and leave the children.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  No, fight these monsters.
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  Don't commit suicide.
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  Don't give up.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  Don't let their evil demoralize you and make you give up.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  Use that and say, God, I need you.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  I'm not strong enough and God will give you the power.
[48:53.000 --> 48:54.000]  Don't worry.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  But careful what you ask for.
[48:58.000 --> 49:03.000]  Because with great knowledge comes great sorrow.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  You know, I could play like 10 clips of them saying
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  they're going to groom our kids on TV and giggling about it.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  We're going to get to it here in just a moment.
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.000]  All the media saying, oh, the virtuous pedophiles,
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  they're such good people.
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  They just love children.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  And it comes out in national, international news
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.000]  that they place tens of thousands of children with pedophiles
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  taken from good family homes.
[49:36.000 --> 49:41.000]  Because the German Pedophile Network run by the Socialist Party
[49:41.000 --> 49:47.000]  and by Merkel's National Democrat Party
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  said the ultimate love is an adult having sex with a child.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.000]  And we'll form a new family with adults having sex with children.
[49:56.000 --> 49:57.000]  What the hell?
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  That's in Der Spiegel.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  That's in DW.com.
[50:01.000 --> 50:04.000]  That's on national TV and it's just a story once or twice
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  and you never hear about it again.
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.000]  Industrial level, child protective services.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Feeding children to pedophiles.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  That's just one big story.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  And I knew the tactics, you know, three, four months ago
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  when that first broke, talked about one psychiatrist in Berlin
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  handing hundreds of children over to dozens of pedophiles.
[50:31.000 --> 50:32.000]  And I said, that's one guy.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  You watch.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  It's a nationwide international network.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  It'll be tens of thousands.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  And it came out a week later, 30,000 children
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.000]  placed with rapists as young as three years of age.
[50:46.000 --> 50:49.000]  Excuse me, two years of age.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  There it is.
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  in pedophile probe.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  And then it got worse than that.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  So what I'm telling you is you can't hide.
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.000]  This is a religion.
[51:00.000 --> 51:03.000]  And remember, roughly half the children that get raped
[51:03.000 --> 51:08.000]  turn into pedophiles or something that is close to it
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  or at least collaborators with it.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  So again, vampires aren't real, but the spirit is real.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  How does a vampire make more vampires?
[51:17.000 --> 51:18.000]  It doesn't have babies.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  It infects someone with the spiritual evil.
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  And that's how they're rising up.
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  And they've built this huge army of pedophiles
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  and they want more.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  They want to destroy the family.
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  They want to drug your children.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  They want to sterilize your boys.
[51:37.000 --> 51:43.000]  They want to destroy creation because they hate God's creation.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  I'll tell you what, I'll start the next hour
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  and I'll play these clips and I'll get into it.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  Just remember this separately.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  The supply chains are breaking down worldwide.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  The third world is starving at double the rate they were.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.000]  China is buying up all the commodities and refusing to ship them,
[51:57.000 --> 51:58.000]  which is fine.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  There's the sotainted.
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  But major supply chains are breaking down.
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  Food lines are starting.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  Food shortages are beginning.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  A lot of farms were able to produce right to destroy what they had.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  Reserves are running out.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  And I believe that you will end up seeing major runs on food
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  if not late this year, early next year.
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  But regardless of all the craziness in the world today
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  and all the destabilization you see,
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  I think one of the smartest things for me to recommend to yourself
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  and to everybody else is high-quality, trouble food.
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  So we have the biggest trouble food company in the United States.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  They're only 13 years old.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  They became the biggest within five years
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  because of quality and the lowest prices.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  Can you find stuff that's even more gourmet
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  that costs four or five times more?
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.000]  Absolutely.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  Literally four or five times more.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  This is like a third of what the grocery store cost.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  And it's really good.
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  Some of it tastes amazing.
[52:47.000 --> 52:48.000]  It's really delicious.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  Some of it's okay.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  But at last 25 years, the packaging is amazing.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  It's what I've chosen for my family, the biggest bang for the buck.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  And I bought it for family as well.
[52:55.000 --> 53:01.000]  I have bought more than 10 one-year supplies
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  from the same group in the last 10 years.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  And when it gets like five years old, it's still perfectly good.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  Give it to the homeless shelter.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  Give it to family.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  And it's still all completely good.
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  And I personally have a three-year food supply for my family right now
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  in my attic and in my garage.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  And I'm probably going to go ahead and just buy more
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  because it's a checkbox you've got to check off.
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  But whether it's a month you get, three months, six months,
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  they have specialty foods, all of it.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  I would get your orders in at m4store.com right now, ladies and gentlemen,
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  because there's only one to two weeks.
[53:32.000 --> 53:33.000]  Waits now.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  It's fresh packed right now.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  I mean, really, they're shipping it in like four or five days on average.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  They said, Alex, just say one to two weeks.
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.000]  And you get it, and you got it, and it's got these great tote containers
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  that if you go to Walmart or someone's trying to buy plastic containers,
[53:45.000 --> 53:48.000]  they cost as much as this does with the food in it, with the markup.
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  It's the same nice big latches and plastic tops and sealed
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  and then great containers inside.
[53:54.000 --> 53:59.000]  And believe me, portability, mobility, packaging is very important.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  It's secondary to what's in it.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  But if it doesn't last and it's not contained
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  in something you just throw in the back of a pickup truck in a rainstorm,
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  whatever, or bury if you need to,
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  just make sure it's not at the water table because it can still seep in.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  But if it's above the water table, say, like, there's a hill on your property,
[54:13.000 --> 54:14.000]  you can bury it up in that.
[54:14.000 --> 54:19.000]  It's, or, you know, in a barn, have a false floor, whatever.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  The point is, is that hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  I will get your orders in now ahead of this election.
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  m4store.com or AAA-2533139.

[54:40.000 --> 55:03.000]  and DrJonesNaturals.com.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  Now, here's the problem.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  Some of the patented ingredients that are in 8-pack PowerStack
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.000]  because of the shutdown and the lockdown are not available for us to even reorder it.
[55:22.000 --> 55:25.000]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.

[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  Take advantage of this new combo special,
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  part of a larger cell we have and free shipping on these cell items

[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  60% off and free shipping.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  Biggest deal on this ever.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  It sounds over the top when I go on air
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  and I explain that the controllers of the planet
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  except for a few of what they call their new transcended silicon gods.
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  But that's really what they're now externalizing.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  and actually openly announcing it everywhere.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  They're going from beta to operation.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  And think about all these major corporations.
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.000]  They tell you humans are horrible.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  They tell you humans are a parasite.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  And then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  and then ship in COVID to kill them.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations.
[56:25.000 --> 56:29.000]  And everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.000]  of larger scalability of what they are now beginning to roll out.
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.000]  Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  They're absolutely essential to stop viral infections like COVID-19.
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  This is all absolute information control.
[56:43.000 --> 57:12.000]  This is beyond 1904.
[57:13.000 --> 57:23.000]  All right, I'm going to come back and get into this religion
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  of the anti-human Satanist next segment and then a lot more.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.000]  But Gregory's has done it again with another powerful report,
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  Freedom Versus Tyranny 2020.
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  It's in the Gregory's section of Band.Video.
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  Band.Video is working well today because last time I checked,
[57:40.000 --> 57:44.000]  the Communist Chinese have not launched giant, you know, hack attacks.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  I guess they only went five days this time in the attack.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  So you can share that video now while you still can.
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  So here is the report.
[57:51.000 --> 58:11.000]  No justice, no peace, these are our dreams.
[58:11.000 --> 58:21.000]  We're going to kill the police.
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  Death to America.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  That's not Iran.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  It's Wisconsin.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  It could have been a dozen other places in this country.
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.000]  The violence has been newly unafated for three months now.
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.000]  By some accounts, 30 Americans have died so far in his riots.
[58:37.000 --> 58:43.000]  Five days into the first Minneapolis riots in May is the city burned live on camera before everyone.
[58:43.000 --> 58:47.000]  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley took to Twitter to support the rioters.
[58:47.000 --> 58:53.000]  It's important to understand that the death of George Floyd was personal and painful for many of Haley wrote.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  People have taken it to the streets and I support them.
[59:02.000 --> 59:09.000]  People were shocked, are we, that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would.
[59:09.000 --> 59:17.000]  The chaos that began with the first George Floyd protest on Memorial Day has reached an inevitable and bloody conclusion.
[59:17.000 --> 59:20.000]  Last night, three people were shot on the streets in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  Two of them have died.
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  There was a shot that was fired as Kyle was retreating actually.
[59:26.000 --> 59:32.000]  A shot by mob that had become enraged that he was trying to put out fires that the Ursins had set.
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.000]  The mob became graged. They started relentlessly hunting him.
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  A shot was fired from behind him.
[59:38.000 --> 59:43.000]  Once Kyle was running away, legally the guy chasing him is now the aggressor.
[59:43.000 --> 59:50.000]  The individual, Mr. Rosenbaum, who was leading the attack on him, set upon him immediately began to assault him from behind.
[59:50.000 --> 59:57.000]  The 17-year-old has been officially charged with two counts of homicide and one count of attempted homicide.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Cause you're crazy.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  There's a lot of confusion about what exactly happened.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  But in at least two of the shooting's video shows where the house was running away, being attacked, and then firing.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  At one point, the 17-year-old was now being charged to try to run from the mob.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  He tripped and fell in the middle of the street.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  A man ran up and smashed him in the head with a skateboard.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  The 17-year-old then fired his gun.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  And now a mob chased Kate one minute.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  As human beings crave orders to prerequisite her life, they fear uncertainty above all.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  People will trade virtually anything for relief from chaos that's a fact if human nature is always true.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Our cities are burning because the people in charge have allowed them to burn.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  But let's be honest, the Justice Department could have stopped all of this months ago.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  If federal prosecutors had treated the organizers of BLM and Antifa the way they treated Roger Stone, our cities wouldn't look like Kosovo tonight.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  What you're watching is an effort by the academic left funded by big business to crush the last permitting resistance to their control of the country.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  And that resistance is an independent American middle class.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  That's who they really hate.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  This is not a racial. This is a class war.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  Absolutely. We'll be right back folks. Stay with us.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  This is not us. This is God working through us, but man, now it's so precious to stay on air.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  I used to think, you know, maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of proceed into the background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  But now with the evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated, I never questioned what I was saying because I knew it was true.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  But I did question where they'd ever actually try to carry it all out.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Well, now we know they're going to carry it out and then some.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  So we got to fight and I just really appreciate you and we're in this together and praise God passed the ammunition, the info war again.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Take action, folks. This is it.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  But your thoughts will soon be wandering.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  It's beyond amazing. It's reality.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  On the road again.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Here I am up on the stage.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  Let's get into it. So Netflix has a whole bunch of pedophilic shows just like vice does an HBO and the New York Times is saying it's a good thing.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  And the German government has just had a huge program of 30,000 children being handed over to convicted pedophiles that live with them to create the beautiful Nambla love.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  And so people are finding out about this and going, man, how could this be?
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  So they distract off onto cuties, which is 10 11 year old girls sexually shaking their asses in front of full grown men and breaking into buildings and committing crimes and promoting communism.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  And I mean, it's a pedophilic program.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  But it's a distraction from the real shows they've got that are like men dresses women having sex with 10 year old children.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  You know, hey, I'm we're going to have sex and it's real.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  Now on the IMDB, they say, hey, this show depicts things defined as pedophilia.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  They want you to know that.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  And then the head of it comes out and says, oh, no, this fights the sexualization of children, kind of like Nike and Lulu lemon having slave camps in China fights slave camps.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  Right.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Or Tim Cook gives money to Black Lives Matter while they have some of the worst slave camps in China.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  It's all just sick, evil virtues signaling to distract you from what they're really doing.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  So videos, I'm not going to show these child actors and Netflix cuties are even more sexualized than conservatives feared.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Yeah, it's it's very risky with, you know, I mean, I'm 46.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  And I would not choose to take my wife to something like this of adult women were doing this.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  I mean, if my wife's like, what are you doing taking me to a Vegas show?
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  What's going on?
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  What are you doing taking me to a topless bar?
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  Some people want to do that.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  Your adults do whatever you want.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  The point is, is that it usually causes a problem.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  This is children.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  And then here's just the stacks of news I have today without even looking.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  Oklahoma man wanted for sexually assaulting baby on video arrested in San Marcos, Texas, south of Austin.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  CBS News, Austin.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  Bryce Gage Watkins was arrested by Lone Star Fugitive Task Force in San Marcos for reportedly sexually assaulting a six month old baby and raping the baby on video and putting it on social media and getting love and likes from all the liberals.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Facebook allows reported baby rapists to keep account, but they banned Kyle Rittenhouse.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Oh, yeah, this is the club.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  There's nothing cooler to these people than destroying innocence and hurting somebody that's innocent.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Here it is Netflix breaks silence on cuties that are massive backlash over sexualization of children.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  Defense movie is powerful story.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  Cuties is a story in the social commentary against the sexualization of young children.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Hitler was pro-Jewish.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  Stalin was pro-capitalist.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  That's what they're saying.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  And that's where these people are coming from.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  It's who they are.
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Of course, that being satirical, Hitler did not like Jews and Stalin did not like capitalism.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of children.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  I watched as much as I could five minutes of it.
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  It was horrible, but it was the tip of the iceberg compared to what goes on with pedophile story time at your local school.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  I would see an interview with Netflix CEO and failed to ask one question about cuties or all the other shows.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  Meanwhile, cuties promotes the hammer and sickle iconography.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  But that's okay.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Athletic apparel company Lulu Lemon sponsors decolonizing gender, resist capitalism, bring down America workshops.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  Even though you look it up, they make almost all their apparel and sweatshops and slave labor in communist China and other hellholes.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  3% of its production is in North America.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  But it's okay because they got a mulatto lady on the front.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  So nice pretty woman.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  So everything's okay.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  They're going to unveil the historical badness of America, but not the current slave camps in China.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  See how that works?
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  As long as you're fighting William Jefferson Davis from 160 years ago, you're fine.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  But you don't fight the other Northam in his black face or his KKK outfit when he keeps the baby comfortable.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And they take the organs and the blood and the skin.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  But then it's all liberal, so it's okay.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  So let's go ahead and roll part of this.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  This is an actress and she's married to the Deadpool guy who's actually a pretty good actor.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  And I never paid attention to Blake.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  Lively.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  But now I do because the actress at an awards program got into what's really going on.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  It's hard to hear this.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  It's hard to see this, but this is what needs to come out.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  And this is what law enforcement told her.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  And I can tell you this is what goes on.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  I just showed you CBS News this happening in Austin and other places just today.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  Because the trendy thing to do is to rape a baby.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  Here is her breakdown of it.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Boys and girls under the age of 18.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  But now because of high speed internet, it's also videos very prominently.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And videos of kids.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  And by kids I mean prepubescent, visibly prepubescent.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  And they make the distinction because of the internet and there's so much content.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  These pedophiles are desensitized.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Because of that, the kids are getting younger.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  And the content is getting that much more devastating.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  So when this law enforcement officer told me this, I asked him how young are the young kids he's seeing.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  And he told me infants.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And I have a six-month-old baby.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  So I said, what does that mean?
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  What does an infant mean?
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And he said, were the umbilical cords still attached?
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I know it's so devastating to hear this.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  And I'm really sorry to share this, but I'm grateful that you guys are listening.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Because this is actually happening.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  And it's important that we know this and that it resonates with us.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  So that we think about this in our days and in our personal life.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  So I asked them what happens in these videos.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  And you know, unspeakable things happen.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  But I'm again going to speak about them.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  Because I feel like if these kids are experiencing this,
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  the least that they deserve is for us to hear what is actually happening to them.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So no, it's not just touching.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  There is penetration.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  There is extreme torture and bondage.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  There is bestiality, which is having an animal penetrate the child or infant.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  There is incest.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  I mean, they said you think of it.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Anything you could think of, it's out there and it's being traded.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  And it's 30 to 50 million files a day being traded that we know of.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  I mean, you can see what's happening right now.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  And this is happening to any child and every child.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  You know, 90% of children know they're abusers.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  So, you know, our children are at risk.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  You may know this person.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  It may be a doctor.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  It may be a coach.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  You know, I thought that people that were working with children were people that wanted to protect them.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  But oftentimes, it's people who have this propensity for wanting to lower children.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  And now they just have Netflix shows where they go,
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  here, I'm leading a kid into a dirty mattress.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  He's 10, never met a 10-year-old top.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  That means that the 10-year-old boy is going to be having sex with the man dressed like a woman.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  And this is going on.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  This is celebrated.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  And that's why people in Hollywood aren't part of it or speaking out against it.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  And so, it's going on in mass.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  But their favorite thing is not just to rape babies.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  It's a black mass.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  They cut them up.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  They drink their blood.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  They kill them.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  So, that's who the Democrat Party are.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  Devil worshiping blood-drinking Satanists.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  I don't want to say I'm a prideful person. I am a humble person overall. I come off as aggressive in things because I'm under threat here, under threat, and I'm fighting as hard as I possibly can.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  And I appreciate your support and your prayers.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  But I know I come off as obnoxious sometimes.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  And I wish I did a better job.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  So, that's why when you call in, thank me all the time.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  You just kind of make me feel pathetic because I guess call it pride.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  I don't like begging you all the time to try our products or to donate or to spread the word or to pray for us.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  I just know that's what keeps us on air.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  And so, I want to thank you.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  It's put the cart before the horse to call it and thank me.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  Listen, I'm committed to this just like you are.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  So, understand, you're my equal 110%.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And I just want to thank you all.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  I want to thank our crew and our affiliates and everybody else, man.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  I just want to stay in this fight.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And it's so serious now.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Things are getting so clear now.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  That's why they want us off here because all of our credibility is so high.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  We'll just stay together, fight hard, spread the word and pray to God to take us through this.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  And we're going to make it.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  And it's free will.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists, the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  and openly tell you that your work was crap and you need to die because that will save the earth.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  And they do everything they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture and in all the different publications.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  They are making you hate yourself.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  They are making you be depressed.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  They are making you not have a connection with God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly control the future.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  And that's what all this is about.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  You know, they say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientists endangering the whole planet with a lot of these technologies,
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  the globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  They call us disruptive to their power grab.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  It's time to say no.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.000]  This isn't a simulation.
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  This isn't Hollywood.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  This is what Hollywood really is.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  This is what the stateless really are.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  They greedily want control of the future.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  They want the souls and destinies and innocence of children.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Here's a short compilation of some of the enemy crawling on the rooftops that our children belong to then.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Teach the children.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  Teach the children.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  I'm all about education.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  I am not there to push any kind of agenda.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  I was told at the library council meeting last night that I'm pushing the trans agenda.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  I'm pushing an overly sexualized agenda.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  Are you nervous?
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  Yes.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  No.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable than seeing it.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  Michael likes to twerk.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  Now does anybody in this room know how to twerk?
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  Turn around and shake your butt, shake them, shake them, shake them, shake them.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  Mommy, shake them, shake them, shake them, shake them.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  Mommy, shake them, shake them, shake them, shake them, shake them.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  I'll show you at the side so you can better be there.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  You'll crouch down into this one a bit more clearly so your bum's sticking out.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  There's crude chalabies right here.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  And then you just move your bum up and down like that.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  And that's twerk.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  So children don't defend themselves.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  A lot of the core values of being a drag queen, love, acceptance, joy, laughter, self-expression are values that we want to instill in our kids.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  So I think it's really important that we bring this program and we spread the joy of reading and the joy of just spreading love.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  So gross.
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  And everywhere else it's called pedophilia.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  But when it's done institutionally and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children,
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  pull up tranny time in the New York schools.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  This is put out in New York Times like it's wonderful.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo potbellied men.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with you clown makeup on just hopping around rubbing their giant bellies in front of children.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  And you're like, what alternate universe is this?
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  What planet did I wake up in?
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  All right.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  Now, Dr. Steven Chenick was on with us yesterday.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  He's going to be joining us again because I wanted to get him on about 9-11 and then we got into a bunch of other subjects and we didn't.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  But we'll talk about who really did 9-11 will name names and just cut right to the heart of it.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  And Steven Chenick did run psychological operations in the State Department.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  He did run major CIA operations.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  He did overthrow governments.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  You just type in his name.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  You'll find times of London articles about it.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  You know, Reuters, you name it from back in the day.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  The stuff he did.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  So when he tells you these names and the stuff that went on, I don't just believe him.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  I did my own research and know it to be very, very accurate.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  We're not saying there isn't radical Islam.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  We're not saying it's not a threat.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  It was involved as a cutout group.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  We're going to explain what happened there.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  And now what they're doing with COVID-19 coming up next segment.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  But let's shift gears into this right now.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  I saw the footage of, it's up on M4Words.com and Bandai Video of Caitlin Bennett at a university.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  And the students start chasing her like zombies, like the zombie apocalypse.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  And reminded me of Carl Rittenhouse.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  And they were trying to assault her.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  So this is mob psychology.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  This is Maoist psychology.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  And so, you know, what happens at this point?
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  Let's go ahead and roll the footage of Carl Rittenhouse.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  Then we'll roll the footage of a Caitlin Bennett last night.
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  So, the mob acts the same at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  It was like they asked to act in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  So let's roll a few minutes as Caitlin Bennett makes it.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Holy fuck, bro.
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  Oh, I thought we bleeped it.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  And these are mainly white students.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  But they hate her because she's white.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  Holy fuck, bro.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  Okay, guys, give pause.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  We had a bleep version when she, Caitlin Bennett, was on yesterday with,
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  I want to throw her in the war room, cannot pretty please sugar on top cupcakes and everything else.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  Can I, can I, can I please have that with that bleep?
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Thank you.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  And we bleep that out.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  So it probably didn't make a lot of sense for some of the radio and TV stations out there.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  But let's just roll the footage then without the audio for TV viewers of them chasing her down and then trying to physically attack her to virtue signal because she's a Trump supporter.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  And because she's a conservative that they are just going to make their bones.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  They're going to attack people.
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  And Caitlin recounted all this with the war room yesterday.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  It's up on man dot video.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  Caitlin Bennett recounts being attacked by psychotic mob at Central Florida University.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  And it goes on and on again.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  The crew does a great job.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  Sometimes they get another version that isn't bleeped and it takes a lot of bleeping.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  Because that's what they do.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:13.260]  Imagine the crazed nature of the left woke mob and
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:18.240]  Again people go. Well. Why are you giving black folks a pass?
[1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:24.360]  Because there are a lot of black folks out doing racial attacks on whites and with BLM. Absolutely. I'm saying in most of the videos
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:26.360]  It's a pack of white people
[1:22:26.920 --> 1:22:33.600]  Trying to virtue signal and they do this weird thing when they go in word in word in word and they go
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:35.600]  I'm allowed to say it because I'm an ally
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:42.640]  You're you're you're attacking journalists. You're attacking police. You're attacking the lowest level of society and
[1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:50.440]  Acting like you're fighting elites when the big money is the ones funding every damn bit of this
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.960]  Folks they plan to disrupt the election. They plan to try to overthrow Trump. They said they're gonna do it
[1:22:55.960 --> 1:22:59.840]  They plan to have a great depression that they have a good chance of getting away with
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:07.040]  If I was you I'd be politically active right now and also get high-quality horrible food and water filtration
[1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:09.040]  We have the very best water filtration
[1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:15.160]  The very best high-quality horrible foods at informer store.com and you know, I don't normally hype food food something
[1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:19.920]  Everybody should have a little bit of a backup. It's great. We always promote it some but I've been harping harping harping
[1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:24.800]  Because you really need the high-quality horrible food. We've got it now. It's one or two weeks for delivery
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:28.360]  Everybody got their food that ordered it from the whole cova hysteria. I said, don't do it for that
[1:23:28.360 --> 1:23:34.160]  Whoever the lockdown of civilization of the depression. They're trying to engineer. So a lot of people are ordering food right now
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:36.160]  And I believe there's gonna be a big rush on food

[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:50.640]  the answer to
[1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:57.880]  1984 is 1776
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:05.440]  Info wars has been banned
[1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:10.040]  Arrested
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:16.280]  Attacked and threatened because we are effective
[1:24:16.280 --> 1:24:24.120]  The Great Awakening is here go to banned video download the videos and share
[1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:30.200]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:35.200]  And never give up the fight
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:37.200]  I
[1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:55.760]  Don't want to be right about this prediction. In fact, it's it's not a prediction
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:57.360]  It is a
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:00.200]  Forecast that we continue down the economic road
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:07.600]  We're on globally with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns and the structure to productivity. It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:09.600]  That are breaking down supply chains that will
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:14.920]  Starm tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:21.800]  That's been built. It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper debt
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:28.440]  Which we're being maneuvered into so I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately
[1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:34.800]  And prosecute the people that launched the giant covid scam the giant covid con game
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:36.640]  There's really just a big power grab
[1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:42.200]  But in case we can't reverse all this we better start digging in and get storeable food and get prepared to be self-sufficient
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:48.000]  That's the name of their game is to make us dependent on them. So get self-sufficient now in full wars dot com
[1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:52.920]  The trick that social engineers use is very very simple
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:59.880]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization that the trajectory of the species is
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:04.040]  Designed by these ever-knowing loving liberal technocrats
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:07.880]  And then if we just sit back and enjoy the ride everything will be great
[1:26:07.880 --> 1:26:14.120]  But then they tell us that humans are obsolete not a sexual or bad for the earth that we need to be phased out so
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:18.120]  They're very open about what they're doing and they count on us
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:24.160]  Just being very passive living in the matrix like system that they're building
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:32.000]  But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:35.400]  We build our own environments. We create our own systems
[1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:41.040]  We really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:47.520]  But instead we're acting like animals laying the globalist by the part of humans and us as cattle. That's the trick
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:54.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:56.480]  And
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:11.920]  We are back
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:15.280]  Well, I really appreciate dr. Steve Picinic for joining us two days in a row
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:19.720]  I wanted to get him on about 9-eleven and 19 years later which is today
[1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:27.080]  But we got into a bunch of other subjects until he's here with us for two long segments one short segment ahead of the Hodge brothers joining us
[1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:29.280]  So let's plunge right into it. He's
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:35.320]  Credited with the only successful peace deal now Trump's got some we hope those end up working for a while
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:40.600]  But the Camp David Accord was co-founding Delta Force with the general Schumacher and Boykin
[1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:46.920]  and then of course working in other administrations worked in five administrations in regime change other clandestine operations and
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:50.360]  You know a lot of the things he's talked about here on air. He's revealed first
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:53.240]  He also co-wrote a lot of books as kind of the Jack Ryan
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.080]  Source
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:59.960]  For what couldn't be put in a nonfiction book was put in the Tom Clancy franchise
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:03.640]  Which a lot of those got turned into movies, but in the time we have let's just get right to it
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:07.720]  What was the motive of 9-eleven? Who was behind it? Why is it important?
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:14.800]  Because again, we're not saying radical Islam doesn't exist. We're not saying that but clearly the stand-down building seven
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:19.960]  How do you want to attack this up front and you talk about meeting in rooms of top generals?
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:24.120]  You know that said point blank. Yeah, it was an inside job. Dr. Steve Picenic. Thanks for your courage
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:29.640]  There's no question. This was an inside job. I before 9-eleven a year before
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:35.960]  After having helped Bush Junior go into the presidency, which was my biggest mistake
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:42.680]  I went around to the Department of Defense and I was asked to look for specific jobs
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:45.720]  And as I went around I saw something very unusual
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:49.480]  I saw CIA operatives in every military position
[1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:54.680]  That I was interested in from Seoul Lake to other areas. It doesn't matter
[1:28:54.680 --> 1:29:01.760]  I went to Andy Marshall who was the head of the office and that assessment trained at the University of Chicago never served in a war
[1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:07.520]  But I knew he was in charge of Cheney, Rumsfeld, Zomechalazad, a whole bunch of neocons
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:13.360]  And what in fact happened a year later? Six months four months before 9-eleven
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:18.200]  I had a knock on the door from two Mossad operatives who really had
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:23.400]  Didn't know what they were doing. They were quite stupid at which I think Mossad is normally
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:27.360]  They knocked on the door and Chevy chased and asked if they could use my phone
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:31.280]  I said under no condition. They pursued I threw them out
[1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:37.080]  So when 9-eleven came around the first person they had to ask about what happened was me
[1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:43.400]  And I said there's no question. This is an inside job Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice,
[1:29:44.040 --> 1:29:48.200]  Colin Powell, Steve Hadley, Frank Fuppiama, Richard Pearl
[1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:54.680]  I knew them all. Most of them went to Cornell and the rest went to Yale and I said these are the corrupt
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:59.600]  Cowards what we call chicken hawks who are involved in creating in 9-eleven
[1:29:59.760 --> 1:30:06.760]  Now how did I know that? Not only did I go around and see Doug Fife and others who never belonged at Department of Defense
[1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:09.880]  I also questioned one of my neighbors
[1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:15.160]  Who in fact was a CIA operative at DOD and knew the entire story?
[1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:21.520]  And I got from her the entire story of who was involved the names and people involved
[1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:22.840]  I put it in the book
[1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:28.320]  American warrior in crisis if people want to look at the various names the key point was that
[1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:36.320]  That Cheney Rumsfeld, Cheney in particular whom I knew from the Nixon administration as I did Rumsfeld was a coward
[1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:41.160]  Probably the most treasonous coward we have ever had in the United States
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:43.160]  He refused to serve us in Vietnam
[1:30:43.800 --> 1:30:50.320]  11 different times with the assistance of his wife and now he has a daughter who to me it's absurd
[1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:52.320]  So what did we learn from that event?
[1:30:52.320 --> 1:31:00.160]  Nothing what I learned from it is number one the military can be manipulated and really can't win a war
[1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:03.560]  Our intelligence service all the way from the CIA
[1:31:03.800 --> 1:31:09.120]  Cheney Haskell to tenant to all the others who were in charge Robert Goss
[1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:12.200]  They were all compromised and got were involved
[1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:13.640]  Number four
[1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:19.840]  I knew Bush jr. Was involved in the same way his father Bush senior was involved in creating a war in the Middle East
[1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:21.840]  Which we had no reason to do
[1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:27.320]  Both men not only Bush jr. Had failed in the military
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:32.360]  Contrary to the myth that's propagated about Bush senior. He was not a war hero
[1:31:32.440 --> 1:31:36.640]  He bailed out of the plane and allowed eight of his front airmen to die
[1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:44.040]  He was a coward Bush jr. A coward corrupt Cheney a coward. I said to Rumsfeld
[1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:46.560]  You're a coward. I know exactly what you did
[1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:53.680]  He went on the radio the next day after I accused him in the administration. He said if somebody accuses the
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:58.120]  Republicans of doing 9-11 which is called the false flag in a standout
[1:31:58.280 --> 1:32:02.160]  Then you have to accuse the Democrats for doing Pearl Harbor
[1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:07.520]  Well as many of you know the false flags of Pearl Harbor means that we knew exactly what's going to happen
[1:32:07.520 --> 1:32:13.240]  They'll Pearl Harbor we wanted to sacrifice three to four thousand men in order precipitate a war
[1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:19.800]  Same way the LBJ had a false flag in Vietnam John F. Kennedy had a false
[1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:23.320]  Let me stop you go to Tonkin and that's absolutely true and let's just go back
[1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:26.640]  Rebuilding America's defenses April 1st
[1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:31.960]  2020 Dick Cheney pins this that report
[1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:37.280]  For the new American century and says we need a new Pearl Harbor
[1:32:37.680 --> 1:32:42.080]  3000 dead, I don't know how they hit it just right less than a year later. I mean they really did a good job
[1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:49.440]  Well, it's not that they did a good job. They were craving individuals. I'll make homicide work for me on the West Bank
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:55.000]  He's a disaster. He's been in he created the war in Afghanistan. He's a CIA operative
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:59.520]  Sure, I was being sarcastic, but I mean so you knew before it even came and you were a big member of the CFR all of this
[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:01.840]  I remember you resigned after all of this. I
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:10.080]  Left because I knew exactly who in the CFR was involved in 9-11 and I told them I'm gonna be the first American to leave your
[1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:15.520]  Organization and what a hundred and twenty years. I could care less the CFR was compromised
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:23.640]  You had the United States government compromised our military intelligence our civilian intelligence our Department of Justice was compromised
[1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:28.960]  the White House was compromised and the House of Representatives sent anything else left
[1:33:29.440 --> 1:33:34.360]  Then what they did was to turn around the narrative and say god
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:42.960]  We are conspiracy truthers as if we had the burden in order to explain why this coward and moron
[1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:49.160]  Who was elected twice because was involved in a 9-11 stand down and false flag
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:53.440]  And we had the biggest coward in our history a treasonous man
[1:33:53.440 --> 1:33:57.680]  He should have been taken out. He should have gone to jail. Of course. Nobody did it
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:04.320]  Cheney didn't go to jail Rumsfeld didn't go to jail by the way black lives matter. I'm gonna be very nice
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:07.800]  We had Colin Powell secretary of state a
[1:34:08.640 --> 1:34:14.040]  Pathological liar in Vietnam. He lied about the incidents and then when he was in the Bush administration
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:20.760]  He lied about anthrax. He was as dumb as they come out of CC and let's talk about what was the motive of 9-11?
[1:34:20.760 --> 1:34:22.120]  What's the motive?
[1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:23.880]  Let me give you another
[1:34:23.880 --> 1:34:25.880]  equal opportunity
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:31.640]  Condoleezza rise whom I knew very well from Stanford. He told what Willie Brown do not fly
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:35.680]  To New York that week and so was the joint chief was told that's all on record
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:43.360]  Correct, but she was a liar national security advisor a coward and what do they do?
[1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:46.960]  They retread everybody the Hoover Institute right now
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:52.360]  You got John who you got Condoleezza rise and I said to the Hoover Institute stick it up
[1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:59.560]  You're out of control the Rand Corporation all of these guys out of control and unfortunately for me
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:04.800]  I knew I was not surprised because I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist. I grew up in Europe
[1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:09.560]  I saw the French collaborate with the Germans. I saw the French beat up Algerians
[1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:13.040]  Moroccans and then assassinate 1 million
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:15.040]  Tutsi's in Rwanda
[1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:18.840]  What I know is that we have lied and we have
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:24.080]  Provericated and we killed our own people not the first time not the last time
[1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:27.560]  But if anybody comes out to be sanctimonious about it
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:35.680]  They better be careful because I was the first one interviewed in this entire episode and I said under no condition was this
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:40.720]  Islamic terrorist well, let's talk about that, but you you also said right after it happened
[1:35:40.720 --> 1:35:42.720]  You met with the top general who confirmed to you it was staged
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:48.480]  Correct and and I said to the generals and I sat down with them. I'm not gonna name them
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:54.320]  I said you have two choices either you resign and I'm going to court marshal you or
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:02.600]  You start to rethink what you're doing and get the civilians out of the Pentagon that meant Doug five Paul Wolfewitz
[1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:05.080]  eventually Paul Wolfewitz a
[1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:06.640]  pathetic
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:12.960]  Cowardly individual who came out of Cornell University by the way one of the big universities to push 9 11
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:18.460]  It had Paul Wolfewitz. It had Steve Hadley Frank Fukuyama and
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:23.160]  Sandy Berger from the Clinton administration Cornell never said a word
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:24.800]  Stay there
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:27.440]  I know people that are in the know understand what you're saying when most listeners do as well
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:29.160]  But let's almost take dumb it down
[1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:33.440]  But let's let's just walk through this when we come back because you have this civilian take over the military
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:36.440]  But they don't know about the consequences and they do these crazy false flags
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:39.880]  We didn't see a revolution the military after all this is trying to kick them out
[1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:46.240]  How has that gone and it's trump the culmination of that a revolution to get the US military back control of themselves
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:53.760]  Well mark Zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with Bloomberg
[1:36:54.040 --> 1:37:01.280]  To launch this operation red mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly clear that Trump has won on election night
[1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:05.560]  Now he's come out the statement and told all the media in the United States
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:12.160]  They better get behind saying the Trump basically lost that they're not gonna let Trump declare victory even though it's overwhelming
[1:37:12.360 --> 1:37:18.200]  They'll have 95% of the vote Donald election night and even if you added all the other votes in against it
[1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:23.960]  He'd be the winner. They are gonna steal this election. They're preparing everyone. You've seen all the scams. They've already run
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:26.400]  Trump is surrounded by tyrants
[1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:31.920]  But he has we the people and he has true media not independent media the real media
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:38.040]  So now more than ever it's critical to share the live streams the videos the articles and the information info wars calm
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:44.920]  Because the globalist fear at most things we were the first to expose their plan to contest the election and drag it out
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:47.400]  To keep the American people from re-electing president Trump
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:54.360]  The clock is ticking on the once free world and the free press is under attack more than ever
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:38:01.560]  I now see videos 10 or 15 times a day without even trying to find them of press being arrested the United States
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:09.920]  Press being arrested Canada the UK Europe Australia New Zealand, and it's always the so-called liberal left the defenders of speech doing it
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:17.640]  They are the authoritarians they work for the Chai Kham globalist combine, and they are working around the clock
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:22.800]  To silence info wars just as we were the group they started with three years ago
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:27.720]  They test out everything new on us and a lot of what I can't get into on air at this point
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:34.160]  I'll be able to reveal this later, but I just want to make you all realize that your support your word of mouth your prayer is

[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:03.120]  And financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:09.560]  And he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have horrible food if they can and now

[1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:54.240]  Ignorance does not equal bliss ignorance equals slavery
[1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:59.800]  If you're ignorant walking through a field at night that there's a six foot hole up ahead
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:05.880]  You're gonna step in it and probably break your ankle or maybe worse. Well, it's the same thing happening to human civilization
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:11.080]  The industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:16.080]  But also took us away from the land and it's very very domesticated and very very easy to manipulate and now
[1:40:16.280 --> 1:40:20.240]  Corruption and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity now
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:26.640]  I know what's going on behind the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation the Davos group and the
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.640]  Goldberg group and all their subsidiaries
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.800]  What the club of Rome say so I know exactly what's going on
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:37.480]  Not because I'm even that cool or special a person
[1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:41.680]  But I'm actually one of the empowered and informed because I'm a history buff
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:45.520]  I know that those that don't know history don't repeat it the globalists think you're stupid
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:48.000]  They laugh at you because you won't research their own admissions
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:41:04.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:26.400]  We're not gonna take it lying down
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:31.320]  Look, I went on air that day and do those were controlled demolitions
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:34.160]  I heard me say they blew up building seven the CIA headquarters
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:39.680]  I got physically sick on air seeing elements of our government did that because I love America
[1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:46.340]  I knew it was globalist imposters and people asked me once Obama got in and things moved on why I didn't cover 9-11 as much
[1:41:46.340 --> 1:41:52.300]  Well, because it was about getting the you know that group of neocons and who did that and I was still exposing false flags
[1:41:52.300 --> 1:41:56.260]  But just I wasn't making my fifth or sixth film on it. I wasn't harping on it every day
[1:41:56.780 --> 1:42:02.220]  Because it people would think then that the government did it when it was criminal elements that did it
[1:42:02.220 --> 1:42:05.740]  And so it actually became destructive with the country. So I want to be clear people asked
[1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:10.900]  Why didn't you keep harping on 9-11? I still talk about it quite a bit. We have guessed on it's important to revisit sometimes, but
[1:42:11.580 --> 1:42:14.220]  How do you expose the criminal elements that did this?
[1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:21.140]  While at the same time not destroying patriotism and having it blow back like the left uses 9-11 to hurt
[1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:24.500]  America when I don't really see it as America that was doing it
[1:42:24.500 --> 1:42:28.860]  You're not just a psychiatrist. You're a you know old-school hand of the world daughter Pachinic
[1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:33.300]  I mean, how do we address something justice be done? May the heavens fall?
[1:42:33.300 --> 1:42:37.020]  But you know at a certain point I still talk about 9-11
[1:42:37.020 --> 1:42:41.820]  But justice never happened so then it almost just becomes destructive to constantly cover it
[1:42:41.820 --> 1:42:49.060]  Not really my friend there. We will not see justice. These are the this issue. We will not
[1:42:49.060 --> 1:42:55.540]  I mean, that's just a point of fact. That's exactly what I've learned the day after that. No one would be held
[1:42:56.220 --> 1:42:58.700]  Accountable you and I can repeat the story
[1:42:59.060 --> 1:43:04.420]  We will be put in Wikipedia as truthers as conspiracy theorists
[1:43:04.500 --> 1:43:08.740]  That's the price that you and I pay for telling the truth
[1:43:08.740 --> 1:43:14.740]  It's the same price when I said look Abraham Lincoln was not a great liberator of slaves
[1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:21.460]  He was a tyrant when he was assassinated the words were thus always with tyrants
[1:43:21.460 --> 1:43:26.220]  And so we create our own narratives which are totally false
[1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:32.060]  You and I will continue that people will cover that over when you see Wikipedia
[1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:36.180]  It's pathetic when I was reading exactly what happened in 9-11
[1:43:36.180 --> 1:43:43.940]  It was pathetic. So they had a separate section which said truthers what the truthers say and that's how pathetic
[1:43:45.380 --> 1:43:49.540]  Intellectualism you're talking about the end of American intellectualism
[1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:53.980]  You're talking about the end of a capacity that we had at one time
[1:43:53.980 --> 1:43:54.940]  No, but I agree
[1:43:54.940 --> 1:43:57.580]  But I mean at the time we have we come back with five hours do this again
[1:43:57.580 --> 1:44:00.940]  It's so important historically I want to cover I just want to cover it right
[1:44:00.940 --> 1:44:05.580]  I know you have a lot of gravitas in this area and what you're saying is a key witness to all this utter machining
[1:44:06.540 --> 1:44:12.060]  So so the neocons and others are behind it. They wanted it for domestic police state to take over the Middle East
[1:44:13.980 --> 1:44:16.940]  In context of 2020 why is it important?
[1:44:18.180 --> 1:44:26.020]  Because you have to understand now that we have a system that really doesn't always work for the people and by the people
[1:44:26.540 --> 1:44:29.940]  Except for one little notation, which is important
[1:44:29.940 --> 1:44:37.060]  We have a new person who has not been part of the CIA not been part of the military not been part of anything
[1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:44.260]  Other than business and his job today is to do business and that's the only salvation
[1:44:44.260 --> 1:44:47.700]  We have so that whatever maverick sui generous
[1:44:48.580 --> 1:44:54.380]  You know other's own kind thing is why they hate Trump and why that's the sui generous movement is the answer
[1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.060]  Correct. I mean we
[1:44:57.060 --> 1:45:02.620]  For whatever reasons we allowed and created a man to come in at this point whom
[1:45:03.340 --> 1:45:11.180]  Ironically everybody involved in 9-11 including the Democrats and Biden was involved and the Clintons were involved in the bushes
[1:45:11.260 --> 1:45:18.380]  Says, oh, he's a pathological liar. Really? Have you seen the videos the day after he said they clearly blew the towers up with bombs
[1:45:19.220 --> 1:45:21.340]  Correct and not only did I see them
[1:45:21.340 --> 1:45:29.300]  But I also heard him say on the same day because I had followed Trump for over 30 40 years. He said my those buildings are pretty strong
[1:45:29.300 --> 1:45:31.300]  I wonder how they can bring him down
[1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:35.860]  So he was basically saying exactly what everybody else knew now
[1:45:35.860 --> 1:45:39.900]  He will play the part of a president that continues that narrative
[1:45:39.940 --> 1:45:47.220]  But beyond that he will not trust anybody and correctly so he has his own family to work with he has
[1:45:47.220 --> 1:45:50.620]  Calling dumb because he doesn't tell any of those people what he really thinks
[1:45:52.340 --> 1:45:57.100]  Really, I mean it's what you and I talked about you're that dumb that you created all these
[1:45:57.940 --> 1:46:02.460]  Condominiums three you're that dumb. You just beat the whole deep state and then held them off for four years
[1:46:03.260 --> 1:46:09.820]  Of course and became a multi-billionaire several times over a low. He had bankruptcy. I'd like to be that dumb
[1:46:09.820 --> 1:46:14.900]  I want to be as dumb as somebody like that who can basically say whatever you want to hear a
[1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:20.140]  Woodward and by the way, Woodward is now getting a congratulations to you Alex
[1:46:20.140 --> 1:46:24.740]  They want to know why Woodward held it for six months a particular secret
[1:46:24.740 --> 1:46:31.300]  It was far more lethal because Woodward once again is a coward. He's a CIA operative out of Yale
[1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:35.860]  Yeah, it doesn't change these people have been highly compromised a
[1:46:36.460 --> 1:46:41.260]  Friend of mine said to me why are you attacking the CIA when I was trained by it?
[1:46:41.260 --> 1:46:46.620]  And I said to this friend who was headed the US Institute of Peace and came out of MIT
[1:46:46.620 --> 1:46:52.900]  I said to him you will see why I never belong to anything except the Republic. I
[1:46:53.260 --> 1:46:57.020]  Was allowed to join the military. I served five presidents
[1:46:57.020 --> 1:47:02.260]  But you've got to owe allegiance to the idea and the people and the dirt not to some corrupt Ivy League
[1:47:02.540 --> 1:47:04.220]  Alidist institution
[1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:08.820]  That's exactly what happened and I said I pledged allegiance to the Republic
[1:47:08.820 --> 1:47:15.780]  That's why I came back with the generals Keith Alexander and others and said this is your time to be in charge
[1:47:15.780 --> 1:47:21.500]  No more rumsfeld no more chainies and no more bushes. I don't want chicken hawks here
[1:47:21.500 --> 1:47:24.860]  I want guys who body Alexander is going over to Amazon
[1:47:26.300 --> 1:47:34.020]  I'm sorry Keith Alexander. Well, he I'll tell you he is very very bright and I know you said for a long time
[1:47:34.020 --> 1:47:36.020]  He'd be the good head of cyber command
[1:47:36.020 --> 1:47:41.540]  Correct, and he was head of cyber command and then his junior subordinates Nakasone
[1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:45.380]  Who's head of cyber command also excellent these guys?
[1:47:45.940 --> 1:47:54.260]  Keith went to the Academy Nakasone did not and then I'm proposing a general Brown for the Air Force to be head of space command and
[1:47:54.700 --> 1:48:01.740]  Space warfare. So we have people on board who are going to be able to do things. I'm proud that Keith will take over Amazon
[1:48:01.740 --> 1:48:08.020]  They need him. He understands cyber control. The world has changed in 20 years number one
[1:48:08.340 --> 1:48:10.900]  You have become a predominant source of information
[1:48:11.180 --> 1:48:15.980]  The New York Times is down the Washington Post is down the Wall Street Journal is done
[1:48:15.980 --> 1:48:19.460]  I don't know if I've become the prominent thing, but definitely part of it
[1:48:19.460 --> 1:48:23.940]  But yeah, what are they gonna do because no one believes a damn word they say and they just keep like seeing it
[1:48:23.940 --> 1:48:28.980]  Especially it's like a zombie undead creature that won't go away, but no one listens to it
[1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:39.140]  I mean, what do you want about Anderson Cooper? He's a openly gay guy who forgets to tell you he had two internships at the CIA and
[1:48:39.300 --> 1:48:41.620]  Once again, he too is compromised
[1:48:41.620 --> 1:48:47.180]  It's almost as if every one of them check their brains right at the agency or somewhere else
[1:48:47.260 --> 1:48:53.940]  But the truth of the matter is I could care less about the CIA or the other 16 intelligence units. They're useless
[1:48:53.940 --> 1:49:00.820]  I'm gonna say the issue is these people are followers who is in control of them because whoever's in control is pretty stupid
[1:49:01.940 --> 1:49:06.580]  They were stupid, but there's a new guy who's in control and his name is Grinnell
[1:49:06.580 --> 1:49:13.500]  And I listened to how he was handling the issues as a former ambassador to Germany insightful
[1:49:14.060 --> 1:49:18.300]  Smart. Oh, yeah, he confronted the media and said don't you understand last week your obsolete
[1:49:18.300 --> 1:49:23.380]  Correct and he said you're not relevant. You're immature your childish
[1:49:23.380 --> 1:49:29.820]  Let me tell you about Serbia and Kosovo and somebody wanted to ask him about being gay eyes. He said it's not relevant
[1:49:29.860 --> 1:49:36.620]  Let's talk about policy. So I think he Trump put in a great guy in the intelligence network
[1:49:36.620 --> 1:49:38.620]  And I hope he takes down a lot of it
[1:49:39.460 --> 1:49:45.020]  Reorganizes in use will be Ross. Well, that's my question if Trump gets four more years, which we hope he does
[1:49:45.020 --> 1:49:48.940]  I think it needs a really clean house. Let's talk about we come back how you would do that
[1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:53.380]  Oh, you were called into some administrations the clean house because we've got to remove all this deadwood
[1:49:53.380 --> 1:49:57.060]  These people are crazy and now it's come out that Robert Mueller was
[1:49:57.620 --> 1:50:03.500]  Wiping all the phones illegally didn't even care like he was above the law. They were I mean, this is just these people are crazy
[1:50:05.420 --> 1:50:13.420]  They're not crazy what they are is, you know Mueller served us well in Vietnam and then he had to
[1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:22.380]  What we got what we call suck up the power and Mueller should be ashamed of himself because as an Episcopalian he really
[1:50:23.860 --> 1:50:29.860]  Degregated he denigrated both our country and both his own religion and to this day
[1:50:29.860 --> 1:50:35.700]  He has never say me a culpa. This is an intellectual who should have gone out of his way to say
[1:50:35.700 --> 1:50:39.060]  I'm not gonna do it. Well, did he not look completely broken in testimony?
[1:50:39.060 --> 1:50:45.020]  Last year, I mean, he looked he looked like a ghost. Correct. He was totally unintelligible
[1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:51.500]  But none of them have come forward and say me a culpa. I've made a mistake. I wanted reform
[1:50:51.860 --> 1:50:58.540]  So the notion of Judeo-Christian overtones in this society is nonsense. It's just a myth and
[1:50:59.180 --> 1:51:03.620]  What comes forth you got the Alex Jones alternative media
[1:51:03.620 --> 1:51:10.500]  Yeah, we gotta go to break see machine.com. What I'm asking is I agree with you. They're a bunch of order followers. So who's in command Obama?
[1:51:10.820 --> 1:51:16.180]  Hillary Soros because I study these people and I watch them and they have to like they get a script
[1:51:16.180 --> 1:51:21.620]  They follow it even after they've lost. They're still following three-year-old scripts. Like there's no one in command
[1:51:21.620 --> 1:51:26.580]  They're following the last election and fighting the last war and and that's actually horrifying
[1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:33.820]  We'll be right back in two minutes final say we don't see machinic than the Hodge twins who are mega viral join us stay with us for 52 days
[1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:47.300]  Ever wondered why big tech accent unison to create monopolies and marks so incredibly anti-human love to censor people love to
[1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:51.460]  Cover up for corrupt authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. Well, it's very simple
[1:51:51.460 --> 1:51:57.700]  The first computers ever created were created by Thomas Watson the founder and owner of IBM to carry out eugenics
[1:51:57.700 --> 1:52:02.740]  And they helped run the death camps in Nazi Germany. That's what the tattoos were on the slaves arms
[1:52:02.740 --> 1:52:09.980]  It would decide who lived and who died. So from the beginning it's been about creating monopolies cornering markets and making humans
[1:52:10.140 --> 1:52:15.860]  Obsolete the same people brought us baby formula that doesn't have an approaching fat in it to make your child's brain small
[1:52:15.860 --> 1:52:21.780]  The same people have said put babies in cribs separate from their mothers the lowers IQs about 20 points on average as well
[1:52:21.780 --> 1:52:30.020]  These are hardcore eugenics survival the fittest social Darwinist grow up world admit the truth with being soft much
[1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:36.540]  Letting these locals run your lives. They are your mortal enemies. They want you dead. Do you understand that?
[1:52:39.580 --> 1:52:45.180]  You can watch a factory of robots being controlled by wireless internet
[1:52:45.180 --> 1:52:46.620]  commands
[1:52:46.620 --> 1:52:50.540]  But if you were a person just 200 years ago, and you saw that you think it was magic
[1:52:50.900 --> 1:52:54.100]  You wouldn't even know really what the machines were or what was controlling them
[1:52:54.540 --> 1:52:58.540]  So for that person it would be spiritual or it would be something of a spirit
[1:52:58.540 --> 1:53:03.700]  And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies many other species of animal
[1:53:03.700 --> 1:53:09.060]  They'll have five thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born. They're following magnetic lines
[1:53:09.060 --> 1:53:16.620]  They have magnetic cells in their brains. We don't know side of what's going on. There's even a lot more than that. So we talk about the spirit
[1:53:17.180 --> 1:53:20.100]  We're talking about all the dark matter. We're talking about all the things you don't understand
[1:53:20.100 --> 1:53:24.780]  But we know it's there and just like you can have a bunch of robots working off the wireless system
[1:53:25.060 --> 1:53:27.060]  That's what's going on with this satanic
[1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:34.220]  Transmission that's working through people and that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a
[1:53:34.220 --> 1:53:38.700]  Consciousness manipulative of space-time continuum
[1:53:38.700 --> 1:54:02.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:54:08.700 --> 1:54:24.780]  Thank you for joining us. We really appreciate you giving us all this time in the four or five minutes we have left
[1:54:26.140 --> 1:54:31.620]  I mean the question I was getting into is it's a little esoteric, but who is in command of the left
[1:54:31.820 --> 1:54:37.740]  Why do they go out of their way to destroy themselves? I don't get self-destruction at that level and what do you expect them to do?
[1:54:37.740 --> 1:54:41.060]  In this election, what should we be watching for in closing?
[1:54:42.540 --> 1:54:46.060]  Basically, you've got nobody in command of this left what's happening
[1:54:46.060 --> 1:54:52.780]  It's basically a conglomerate of ineffectual people who had an ideology that once was vibrant for them
[1:54:53.140 --> 1:55:00.460]  But you have a Soros is funding some things that Hillary Clinton's it just names at this particular point in time
[1:55:00.460 --> 1:55:05.820]  You're not gonna have a Democratic Party as far as I'm concerned the Republican Party is gone
[1:55:05.820 --> 1:55:09.020]  the party that really is in power is called Trump and
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:17.900]  He will appoint those people he needs in order to affect change the notion of ideological parties at the time of the social
[1:55:17.900 --> 1:55:25.780]  Media is antiquated what's relevant now are little pieces of information that comes across at different times on the internet
[1:55:26.300 --> 1:55:29.500]  Social media most people are getting addicted to it
[1:55:29.500 --> 1:55:34.780]  But in reality the parties are really antiquated you don't need a house of representatives
[1:55:34.780 --> 1:55:41.980]  You don't need a Senate those are just welfare victims what you do need are the governors and Abbott is important
[1:55:41.980 --> 1:55:49.260]  DeSantis in Florida is exceedingly important because he can do whatever he wants and he can defy the principles of the federal government
[1:55:49.580 --> 1:55:54.220]  The federal government is already breaking up in terms of a cyber nation
[1:55:54.220 --> 1:56:00.780]  The two ends of the east and the west and the south are really non-functional anymore the cities are empty
[1:56:00.780 --> 1:56:08.380]  So what you have is a new era where a businessman is coming in he will create peace in different
[1:56:08.860 --> 1:56:15.900]  Areas of the world Bahrain will that be the next one in terms of a peace treaty then Oman and then Saudi Arabia
[1:56:16.300 --> 1:56:21.260]  Then I predict he will have a treaty with Iran and China and North Korea
[1:56:21.660 --> 1:56:27.900]  So what will happen is we expand in peacefully externally internally will be imploding
[1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:33.420]  Pretty much around the democratic cities and the major cities that are controlled by Democrats
[1:56:33.820 --> 1:56:41.500]  Why it has to do with the fact that most of them are pretty ineffectual in terms of creating a business or running anything
[1:56:41.500 --> 1:56:43.900]  Como has never run a business
[1:56:44.300 --> 1:56:49.900]  Como's mother is a lovely person whom I know but both sons are totally dysfunctional
[1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:53.980]  They can talk they create process but nothing else
[1:56:53.980 --> 1:56:59.660]  So when you're in the business of process unlike you and I where we have a product you have a product
[1:56:59.980 --> 1:57:03.420]  You have vitamins. You have a content. I have content
[1:57:04.060 --> 1:57:08.140]  That's different from the people who are in the process business, which is politics
[1:57:08.860 --> 1:57:16.380]  Politics will no longer supersede the ongoing relationships that we have in terms of moments of truth
[1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:18.460]  What they will call the alternative truth
[1:57:18.460 --> 1:57:25.260]  I eat the alex jones of the steve whatever his name is pacenic and you will have a social media where
[1:57:25.260 --> 1:57:28.780]  By the way, this is not wishful thinking you got to come back again soon because you said all this on the show
[1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:31.980]  18 years ago and I thought you were being too big an optimistic
[1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:36.460]  They've made themselves obsolete and so everybody ran from the east to the west
[1:57:36.780 --> 1:57:38.780]  They made the west the east now
[1:57:38.780 --> 1:57:42.540]  They're running to the middle to get away from themselves and these systems are literally
[1:57:43.020 --> 1:57:46.940]  Making themselves obsolete and then trying to bully all us into submission
[1:57:46.940 --> 1:57:49.980]  But only destroying themselves faster. It's an incredible process
[1:57:50.780 --> 1:57:56.140]  Well, it was predictable and that process really had the final punch, which was
[1:57:56.940 --> 1:57:59.980]  coronavirus was that incidental or coincidental?
[1:58:00.380 --> 1:58:02.380]  I don't have to get into it, but it was not
[1:58:02.940 --> 1:58:07.660]  But they inflict the biggest lockdowns on themselves to control us only destroying themselves
[1:58:08.460 --> 1:58:15.660]  Correct. And that's what happened. We eventually went into self-destruction, which is the final moment of 9 11
[1:58:15.660 --> 1:58:21.020]  Where we self-destruct cutting the nose off despite the face amazing dr. Steven kinnick. Thank you so much
[1:58:21.820 --> 1:58:27.740]  Thank you. Alex and god bless. I bless you. We have big powerful 9 11 interview and that's the real deal ladies and gentlemen
[1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:33.100]  All right, the hodge brothers are on fire. They've always been on fire for years. They're really in fuego now

[1:58:56.060 --> 1:59:01.900]  They're saying they can test the election and plunge the country into the war and they are throwing hack attacks at them for wars
[1:59:02.380 --> 1:59:05.500]  Dirty tricks attempts to shut us down. It's incredible

[1:59:12.140 --> 1:59:14.060]  We've only got a few months
[1:59:14.060 --> 1:59:17.900]  Of backup if money wasn't coming in we'd be shut down and that's not good
[1:59:18.460 --> 1:59:20.620]  We need to have extra money in our coffers
[1:59:20.860 --> 1:59:24.140]  People to expand in this home stretch not just contract
[1:59:24.380 --> 1:59:28.700]  We're winning but these scumbags aren't going to give us the victory without a fight
[1:59:28.860 --> 1:59:31.500]  So I know you're going to step up and in four store.com

[2:00:16.700 --> 2:00:18.700]  I've been loving these guys for years
[2:00:18.860 --> 2:00:26.300]  But man are they popular now and are they exploding millions of views every day despite the shadow banning the hodge twins
[2:00:26.780 --> 2:00:31.100]  On youtube conservative twins instagram official hodge twins on twitter hodge twins
[2:00:31.580 --> 2:00:35.820]  And they're here with us live on this friday edition to cover the waterfront, but
[2:00:36.860 --> 2:00:38.860]  I just learned this
[2:00:38.860 --> 2:00:41.100]  A few minutes ago, so i want to get their take on this
[2:00:41.100 --> 2:00:46.700]  Trump nominated a second time for nobel prize the hill. I remember the swedish parliament
[2:00:47.260 --> 2:00:51.500]  On friday nominated trump and the governments of coastal and syria
[2:00:52.540 --> 2:01:00.700]  For the 2021 nobel peace prize over economic cooperation and trade talks now. They have the UAE deal with israel. That's that's worthy of it
[2:01:00.700 --> 2:01:04.460]  You got trump pulling us out of afghanistan syria iraq. That's worthy of it
[2:01:04.860 --> 2:01:08.540]  I mean, uh, so i want to just invite these gentlemen to give me their view
[2:01:08.540 --> 2:01:14.300]  On does trump deserve this nomination and does trump deserve the second nomination?
[2:01:15.260 --> 2:01:21.100]  And did obama deserve his winning of the peace prize many many years ago before even got an office
[2:01:21.100 --> 2:01:24.540]  So gentlemen, thank you for spending time with us and congratulations on your great success
[2:01:25.420 --> 2:01:28.540]  Oh, thank you. Thank you for having us, but uh, yeah, of course he deserves it
[2:01:28.940 --> 2:01:34.620]  I mean trump's done an amazing job since he came in the office and they set the bar so low
[2:01:34.620 --> 2:01:39.340]  Yeah, not only did they nominate obama. He won the prize
[2:01:39.740 --> 2:01:46.060]  Yeah, but after doing absolutely nothing the deal he broke between the UA. I mean nobody saw that coming
[2:01:46.140 --> 2:01:51.900]  He's did a amazing job since he became president. He's stopping the endless wars around the world. Yeah, of course
[2:01:52.220 --> 2:01:54.220]  He most definitely deserves that. Yeah
[2:01:54.860 --> 2:01:59.900]  Well democrats and republicans always say they want to be peacemakers when trump is ridiculous north korea
[2:01:59.900 --> 2:02:04.540]  Syria iraq afghanistan
[2:02:05.740 --> 2:02:07.740]  Serbia and the Balkans
[2:02:08.220 --> 2:02:10.940]  And then now all these other deals. This is getting crazy
[2:02:12.700 --> 2:02:18.140]  Yeah, I thought it was amazing when he uh, I he'd broken that relationship with uh, kim jong-ung
[2:02:18.300 --> 2:02:20.860]  I think i'm pronouncing his name right. Yeah, and not only man
[2:02:21.020 --> 2:02:23.980]  Yeah, I started talking to him on twitter called him rocket man
[2:02:24.140 --> 2:02:27.820]  Yeah, and then he goes over to the first u.s. President to ever do that
[2:02:27.820 --> 2:02:34.780]  Right. I mean this president not only he's a great leader. This man has balls and he's not a politician
[2:02:34.860 --> 2:02:39.740]  He's showing what a leader of the united states of the free world. What a leader should do
[2:02:39.900 --> 2:02:43.900]  I totally agree because he's deal with the uh coronavirus man. He'd locked this country down
[2:02:43.980 --> 2:02:50.060]  He's did things that was unprecedented and nobody's giving him any credit for him if he didn't do that if hilly was in office
[2:02:50.220 --> 2:02:53.740]  Is our president she wouldn't have did any of that. Yeah, well that was my next question
[2:02:53.740 --> 2:02:58.060]  That that was my next question. In fact cue up the clip where they call him a liar. He's in there with the press conference
[2:02:58.220 --> 2:03:01.180]  He's the one that locked the us down and blocked the flights from china
[2:03:01.500 --> 2:03:05.180]  When polosi was going around saying don't do it and so was biden
[2:03:05.660 --> 2:03:09.420]  And and then they were telling trump four percenter dynes. He goes well, hell, I better lock it down
[2:03:09.580 --> 2:03:14.300]  Apparently it wasn't as deadly as they said so because he's saying it's deadly six months ago when they were telling him that
[2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:18.460]  And now he says it's not as bad. Thank god. That's not lying. That's getting new information
[2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:24.860]  Yeah, and don't forget they call him xenophobic when he locked down the country. Yeah, and uh, what was it?
[2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:27.980]  uh, polosi said come on down to china town she's down there
[2:03:28.220 --> 2:03:34.940]  Hugging china man and all that stuff encouraging people to not social distance and to hug people just because they're asian
[2:03:35.020 --> 2:03:40.140]  Yeah, because they claim trump xenophobic. I mean looking back on that. It's just it's just perihopocrisy
[2:03:40.540 --> 2:03:44.220]  I mean, I think he's done a phenomenal job. They blame it everybody, but china
[2:03:44.220 --> 2:03:49.820]  Yep, trump is making america great again while china they're making viruses great again
[2:03:49.820 --> 2:03:52.940]  And don't forget when trump did the state of the unit speech. He mentioned
[2:03:53.420 --> 2:04:00.700]  Uh, corona virus aka chinese virus and polosi ripped up his speech. Yeah, I mean who really loves american who hates america? Yeah
[2:04:01.820 --> 2:04:04.780]  Well, absolutely. I don't see americans buying
[2:04:05.500 --> 2:04:11.100]  That trump's a racist or that trump's behind the virus when there's no evidence. I see that backfiring. What do you guys see?
[2:04:11.100 --> 2:04:13.820]  Well, there's a lot of idiots in this country
[2:04:14.460 --> 2:04:20.860]  I mean look back at this past election. Yeah, hillary actually won a popular vote. How dumb is this country?
[2:04:21.500 --> 2:04:25.660]  There's a lot of fools out there alex. Hey alex thank god for the electoral college
[2:04:26.780 --> 2:04:32.380]  No, I hear you and now hillary says they're gonna challenge. She's the boss the election no matter what
[2:04:32.940 --> 2:04:36.700]  Uh, now we learned that the madis had a coup plan against trump. This is crazy
[2:04:36.700 --> 2:04:41.100]  Right. Yeah, and they're trying to steal his election with the mail-in ballots
[2:04:41.340 --> 2:04:46.460]  I say, hey, if you're also confident with confident with the mail-in ballots, go ahead and mail in your ballots
[2:04:46.540 --> 2:04:51.660]  Us conservatives republics. I'm going to show up and I'm going to make my vote. Yeah, yeah, because I'm a patriot
[2:04:51.740 --> 2:04:55.180]  I'm going to make sure my vote is counted. Well, trump made the point that
[2:04:56.380 --> 2:04:59.340]  Just as you just said that I hope they're not voting twice
[2:04:59.340 --> 2:05:03.420]  Well, now we know all over the country where they've been doing it democrats. It's mainly democrats
[2:05:03.420 --> 2:05:08.380]  Because they don't care about the law. They're voting via mail and then going in and voting at the polling place
[2:05:09.740 --> 2:05:10.940]  Right
[2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:14.220]  That could easily happen. I mean come out of these all the special elections
[2:05:15.180 --> 2:05:17.180]  Michigan you name it. It's been happening
[2:05:17.500 --> 2:05:22.140]  Yeah, I mean, how can you keep track of I mean I could keep track of what my left and right hand doing
[2:05:22.220 --> 2:05:26.620]  But you can't keep track of what's going on if you mail in a vote and then you're going in the vote
[2:05:27.020 --> 2:05:30.620]  Yeah, I mean, it's it's just going to open up so much fraud in this next election
[2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:35.660]  And if there's a lot of mail in votes, I mean the election's not going to be considered determined that night
[2:05:35.740 --> 2:05:40.940]  It's going to take weeks and months. Well, that was the plan the democrats had met by having 80 million mail-ins
[2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:45.580]  It's going to gum it up. They're just going to challenge it and now the media is working with zuckerberg
[2:05:46.220 --> 2:05:50.940]  And facebook and google to say they're not going to let us say we think trump won that is so dangerous
[2:05:53.420 --> 2:05:57.180]  I can see it coming. I mean what they said about that that kid written house who just
[2:05:57.180 --> 2:06:01.340]  Just self-defense anybody talks about that the video goes down
[2:06:01.580 --> 2:06:06.060]  But you call them a mass murderer. It's it goes viral on facebook. It doesn't make any sense
[2:06:06.220 --> 2:06:09.420]  Well, that's what facebook said. They said last week as you know, they said
[2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:15.260]  We've determined. He's a mass murderer. So did twitter so his lawyer can't speak for him
[2:06:15.500 --> 2:06:20.140]  They're blocking his lawyer. So now even your lawyer doesn't have speech that violates the constitution
[2:06:21.020 --> 2:06:25.420]  Oh, yeah, and don't forget. There's a video of Gavin Newsom the of out of california
[2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:27.420]  He's got a video up on facebook
[2:06:27.980 --> 2:06:29.980]  Clearly stating that trump called
[2:06:30.220 --> 2:06:32.220]  mexicans and immigrants
[2:06:32.220 --> 2:06:36.700]  Um, what's the term he called rapist and rapist and murders when they know good and well
[2:06:36.700 --> 2:06:41.980]  There was a doctored video where they took it out of context and he was referring to ms13 game
[2:06:42.300 --> 2:06:45.660]  Nobody fact-checked that video that video still up with means of views
[2:06:47.820 --> 2:06:50.460]  Guys I could ask a thousand questions and I've got a thousand questions
[2:06:50.460 --> 2:06:55.100]  But what's the center for you guys to win this election and save the country?
[2:06:55.500 --> 2:07:01.260]  Man, I just we cannot become complacent. I mean if you're, um, physically fit
[2:07:02.140 --> 2:07:04.700]  Go out and vote if you have any like, um
[2:07:05.580 --> 2:07:09.740]  Um, pre-existing issues and you don't feel safe going on vote. Let's take precautions
[2:07:09.820 --> 2:07:12.220]  But this election is so important these people
[2:07:13.020 --> 2:07:17.260]  People are sitting back saying that you know, it doesn't matter who's in office or no
[2:07:17.260 --> 2:07:21.740]  You've got grown folks deciding on how you and your kids are going to live. Don't be a child
[2:07:22.220 --> 2:07:25.420]  Make a decision make sure you show up and vote especially if you
[2:07:25.660 --> 2:07:30.140]  Communism is a lot more dangerous than coronavirus and I agree people better knock on doors
[2:07:30.860 --> 2:07:34.620]  And they better get because they know conservatives will tend to follow directives. We're trying to work together
[2:07:35.180 --> 2:07:38.700]  They know liberals will violate rules. That's why they're doing the lockdown to keep us from voting
[2:07:39.020 --> 2:07:43.180]  Don't just go vote bring everybody with you get them. Yeah registered now
[2:07:43.420 --> 2:07:46.140]  How many days left only a few days left to most areas to get registered?
[2:07:46.140 --> 2:07:54.300]  Yeah, yeah, all my whole entire family is registered. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready rock and roll. Yeah, this is d-day for me. Yeah
[2:07:55.340 --> 2:07:59.020]  War war three. Let me ask you about that question. What is Trump going to do? I think it's reelected
[2:08:00.460 --> 2:08:01.900]  I think he's did an amazing job
[2:08:01.900 --> 2:08:07.260]  I think he just continued to keep his pace to tend to beat donald trump and do what he's been doing for the past
[2:08:07.340 --> 2:08:11.100]  Four years he put in america first and I think if if hopefully he does get reelected
[2:08:11.260 --> 2:08:14.300]  I think then he's not going to have to worry about being reelected
[2:08:14.300 --> 2:08:16.300]  He's going to really show
[2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:21.340]  What a leader should be doing now. I agree. I mean protest. Yeah. Yeah, this just has to be itself
[2:08:21.340 --> 2:08:23.180]  That's why everybody gravitate towards him
[2:08:23.980 --> 2:08:27.180]  I hope he wins this one, but I'm already worrying about four years from now
[2:08:27.820 --> 2:08:31.740]  I'm like, I'm what happens what what happens when he's like 80 years old
[2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:35.420]  I mean, hopefully this is the foundation this

[2:11:14.540 --> 2:11:19.900]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out in the open
[2:11:20.380 --> 2:11:24.060]  Our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off there. That's why America

[2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:51.900]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:05.020 --> 2:12:07.580]  You know the level of brainwashing
[2:12:08.460 --> 2:12:14.140]  And censorship going on by big tech has gotten crazy where they censor the president they censor everybody
[2:12:14.140 --> 2:12:16.460]  They've been I know been censored the hodge twins some
[2:12:17.100 --> 2:12:19.100]  but they even have
[2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:21.260]  Stories out there
[2:12:21.260 --> 2:12:23.900]  Where if you talk about the la public health director
[2:12:24.460 --> 2:12:27.660]  Caught on tape saying they're gonna only unlock things after the election
[2:12:28.220 --> 2:12:32.620]  And then james woods tweets a picture of her saying why the hell does she look like she's dying? They go?
[2:12:32.620 --> 2:12:37.500]  It's a fake photo. We're not being mean. Why do all these health directors look like they're dying?
[2:12:37.980 --> 2:12:40.140]  So the associated press put an article out
[2:12:40.140 --> 2:12:46.060]  Saying it's a fake photo that she looks like maryland and roe, but then that's a real photo of her
[2:12:46.060 --> 2:12:49.980]  So now we can't even say why do these health directors look like they've been
[2:12:51.660 --> 2:12:59.020]  Smoking boatloads of crack or drinking drano or something. I mean that level of us not even being able to objectively say that
[2:12:59.500 --> 2:13:01.500]  To me is just crazy. What do you guys think of that?
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:16.940]  We got the hodge twins with us. One of you guys. I think your mics might be still muted, but uh
[2:13:17.820 --> 2:13:19.820]  Speaking of gaslighting people
[2:13:20.060 --> 2:13:23.660]  Telling people that we can't believe our eyes nadler says that there is
[2:13:24.540 --> 2:13:25.820]  no
[2:13:25.820 --> 2:13:30.300]  Such thing as anti for burning down these cities and shooting everybody and doing this
[2:13:30.300 --> 2:13:32.300]  It's only to ask what you thought of him. Here he is
[2:13:33.740 --> 2:13:36.300]  There's violence across the whole country. Do you disavow the violence from antifa?
[2:13:37.180 --> 2:13:40.060]  That's happening in portland right now. That's that that's a myth
[2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:47.900]  That's being spread only in washington dc about antifa in portland. Yes, there's there's videos everywhere online. There's fires and riots
[2:13:47.900 --> 2:13:49.900]  There's the gentlemen
[2:13:50.220 --> 2:13:52.940]  They're saying things like that. What do you make of that?
[2:13:52.940 --> 2:13:59.500]  I mean, why would anybody listen to a guy that pulls his pants right up on his nipples and he walks like that?
[2:14:08.700 --> 2:14:13.820]  All right, listen guys you guys are great, but the but the hodge twin and blue because I get twins mixed up
[2:14:14.140 --> 2:14:16.380]  I think your mic is muted. It's not coming through
[2:14:17.420 --> 2:14:20.060]  So slap it a couple times. It's just like what my mic doesn't work
[2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:24.380]  All right, it's working now. Give me now. Yes, sir. Sorry start again
[2:14:25.180 --> 2:14:27.180]  That actually just picked my interest. Tell me
[2:14:27.660 --> 2:14:33.340]  Yeah, I'm thinking anybody pulls his pants up run his nipples that high you can't listen to him about anything
[2:14:33.420 --> 2:14:35.740]  He loses all credibility. Yeah, and
[2:14:36.620 --> 2:14:44.140]  To say that antifa or these rides is false. I mean everybody has two eyes even ray charles and stevie wonder
[2:14:44.700 --> 2:14:46.300]  You can see that
[2:14:46.300 --> 2:14:51.580]  Yeah, I mean I've said this many times anybody that's on the left
[2:14:52.860 --> 2:14:59.500]  They're not very bright because if you look at both sides, you wouldn't be on the left. Yeah, it's like
[2:15:00.780 --> 2:15:02.780]  It's got these people like
[2:15:02.860 --> 2:15:07.820]  Brain dead to believe that antifa does not exist. Yeah, or these rides are not happening
[2:15:07.820 --> 2:15:13.420]  I mean, you have to be mentally intellectually weak not to be able to think for yourself and that's his man for his word
[2:15:13.420 --> 2:15:17.180]  Yeah, and that's the constituents on the left. They are intellectually weak their sheep
[2:15:17.260 --> 2:15:21.900]  They just go by whatever the tv tells them to do and that's why they have these people because
[2:15:22.300 --> 2:15:28.540]  Mainstream media is all over every channel. They have the upper hand and these people fall prey to them. Yeah
[2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:33.180]  I'ma tell you something right now and you're not a sponsor. I'm saying this I believe it
[2:15:33.260 --> 2:15:37.580]  I'm gonna get a blue shirt and a red shirt and one of those hats because they look great
[2:15:37.660 --> 2:15:41.660]  I love what you're doing. How do I how do I get one of these awesome hodge twin shirts or hats?
[2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:43.180]  I

[2:16:01.020 --> 2:16:05.260]  Well, let me throw this in there if you read back to the clinton foundation not the new foundation their original
[2:16:05.820 --> 2:16:07.820]  foundation that became the library
[2:16:07.820 --> 2:16:12.700]  Um world that daily suit and got documents that said in there back in like 1993 when they got elected
[2:16:12.700 --> 2:16:18.220]  They said we can't let conservatives ever have merchandise or books or films or their own culture
[2:16:18.620 --> 2:16:23.340]  Because it's more popular. We've got a bankrupt anybody tries to fund themselves
[2:16:23.580 --> 2:16:29.980]  And so that's why you guys being successful and you guys making great stuff and you guys getting bigger is all of us getting bigger
[2:16:30.220 --> 2:16:32.620]  So I just love what you're doing how do folks find everything you're doing

[2:16:41.020 --> 2:16:45.580]  Conservative twin. Yeah. Well, you guys have been blowing up for a while, but your growth rate right now
[2:16:45.580 --> 2:16:47.580]  You'll be bigger than Joe rogan in six months
[2:16:48.460 --> 2:16:50.460]  Yeah, wish Joe rogan let me come on and show
[2:16:51.500 --> 2:16:54.460]  Well, he lives down the street now. I'm not gonna have to go talk to him. Yeah, I hear you
[2:16:55.180 --> 2:16:56.300]  yeah
[2:16:56.300 --> 2:16:58.860]  Yeah, he moved to texas got the hell out of that damn coming for you
[2:16:58.860 --> 2:17:04.460]  I got the hell out of there. He probably started adding up how much taxes he paying every month to his state
[2:17:04.460 --> 2:17:10.220]  Said, you know what? This is not freedom. I'm going to Texas. It took him long enough. You know, he should have you guys on
[2:17:11.260 --> 2:17:12.300]  Yeah
[2:17:12.300 --> 2:17:15.820]  Well, I just love having you here now. I could ask a lot of questions, but but but let me get into this
[2:17:15.900 --> 2:17:19.820]  I'm sure you saw Caitlyn Bennett at central florida university in Orlando
[2:17:21.020 --> 2:17:26.220]  Just like written houses being chased down, but they chased her down and began to attack her bodyguards. I mean, this is getting scary
[2:17:26.220 --> 2:17:31.100]  Yeah, it's just people on the left man
[2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:34.460]  It's came to a point that they don't want to debate. They don't have a discussion
[2:17:34.540 --> 2:17:39.980]  He's either my way or the highway and that's pretty sad because we both need people on the left and the right
[2:17:40.060 --> 2:17:41.820]  I mean, we're never going to agree on everything
[2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:48.220]  But at this point in time in in society, nobody wants to listen on the left or take any criticism
[2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:50.220]  Hey, hey, Alex, you know, it's crazy
[2:17:50.220 --> 2:17:55.420]  The democrats back in the 50s and 60s, you know the segregation of Jim Crow laws attacking people
[2:17:55.420 --> 2:18:02.780]  Yeah, it's crazy as hell now that they're doing it in 2020 against this conservative. Yeah, anybody thinks different for him
[2:18:02.780 --> 2:18:07.340]  They're doing the exact same time. It's the exact same thing like I've seen black lives matter
[2:18:07.740 --> 2:18:09.740]  And there's white people walking with them
[2:18:10.140 --> 2:18:14.860]  In unison supporting black lives matter and then these black people go up to like
[2:18:15.580 --> 2:18:21.420]  Elderly white people just sitting eating at a restaurant attacking them eating their food off the plate. This is what happened
[2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:26.140]  That's why Martin Luther King was so important. And now here we are in 2020
[2:18:26.700 --> 2:18:31.820]  Yeah, democrats are doing the exact same thing. I'm still amazes me that they're pushing this
[2:18:31.900 --> 2:18:38.220]  I mean anybody with two eyes and a brain you should be able to look up for yourself on google and and clearly see
[2:18:38.700 --> 2:18:43.980]  That these statistics do not support police officers hunt down black men like animals
[2:18:43.980 --> 2:18:49.340]  You're more likely a police are white police officers way more likely to die to a black dude
[2:18:49.340 --> 2:18:52.060]  Yeah, and almost 18 to one
[2:18:52.380 --> 2:18:54.380]  But statistically speaking
[2:18:54.380 --> 2:19:00.780]  Black men are being hunted down by black men and they were refused to acknowledge that fact. Yeah
[2:19:01.900 --> 2:19:07.580]  So where does it go? Where does it end? What happens in cities? I agree god forbid what happens if trump loses?
[2:19:09.580 --> 2:19:14.220]  All of us just going to have to remain strong and keep spreading our voice and keep fighting. That's all we can do
[2:19:14.860 --> 2:19:16.860]  I'm definitely not going to give up like a liberal
[2:19:16.860 --> 2:19:23.260]  Just keep fighting Alex. Just keep going. We're gonna keep doing what we're doing. Yeah, keep doing what you're doing
[2:19:23.660 --> 2:19:25.500]  All those pictures you're just going to fight together
[2:19:25.500 --> 2:19:29.420]  And you know what Alex sometimes you got to take two steps back before you can take two steps forward
[2:19:29.500 --> 2:19:34.460]  If that should happen, I'm not going to stop putting out. Um, no, no, I totally agree in a sick way
[2:19:35.100 --> 2:19:38.540]  I don't want trump to lose but if they did it'll be so bad on the left that'll be
[2:19:40.060 --> 2:19:43.020]  I mean, it'll definitely be over if we survive
[2:19:43.020 --> 2:19:50.620]  Yeah, I mean we're facing facebook censorship of our facebook page is facing being unpublished because they say what we're saying is hate speech
[2:19:52.060 --> 2:19:54.060]  I mean speeches
[2:19:54.380 --> 2:19:58.620]  I mean it's crazy. Just because you hate hearing it doesn't make it hate. Yes
[2:19:59.500 --> 2:20:06.140]  Well, I watch you guys every day and so does my son and you guys are very well spoken and very friendly and very jovial and very positive
[2:20:06.620 --> 2:20:12.140]  But that's why they don't like you because the truth is it's not hate. It's popular and it's true. They don't like what's true
[2:20:12.140 --> 2:20:19.340]  They don't like what's popular because they're selling global tyranny. The hodge twins are our guests. I want to come back
[2:20:20.140 --> 2:20:22.300]  And place some clips for them and get their take on
[2:20:22.780 --> 2:20:27.660]  What they think trump ought to do because trump does listen to them. I can tell you trump listens does he listens to all of us
[2:20:27.980 --> 2:20:34.300]  What do we want to see trump do next with 52 days out to really get on the offense and ensure this win
[2:20:34.300 --> 2:20:42.140]  Because this race is close because of election fraud. We're right back with the hodge twins. I'm Alex Jones news wars dot com
[2:20:43.660 --> 2:20:45.660]  It sounds over the top when I go on air
[2:20:46.220 --> 2:20:52.220]  And I explained that the controllers of the planet want to carry out the extermination of the entire human population
[2:20:52.700 --> 2:20:56.860]  Except for a few of what they call their new transcendent silicon gods
[2:20:57.260 --> 2:21:03.260]  But that's really what they're now externalizing. They're now taking what was in their textbooks and white papers 30 years ago
[2:21:03.260 --> 2:21:08.140]  And actually openly announcing it everywhere. They're going from beta to operation
[2:21:08.380 --> 2:21:12.940]  And think about all these major corporations. They tell you humans are horrible. They tell you humans are a parasite
[2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:18.060]  They tell you that we've all got to be gotten rid of and then they won't let people see their old folks in nursing homes
[2:21:18.140 --> 2:21:20.060]  And then ship in covet to kill them
[2:21:20.060 --> 2:21:23.740]  That's all organizing as a beta test for larger operations
[2:21:23.820 --> 2:21:30.140]  And everything is a microcosm and a laboratory test of larger scalability of what they are now
[2:21:30.140 --> 2:21:35.020]  Be getting to roll out. Look at how they're banning medical doctors from promoting therapeutics
[2:21:35.180 --> 2:21:42.940]  They're absolutely essential to stop viral infections like covet 19. This is all absolute information control. This is beyond 19 four
[2:21:44.380 --> 2:21:47.180]  I don't want to be right about this prediction
[2:21:47.900 --> 2:21:51.260]  in fact, it's it's not a prediction it is a
[2:21:52.060 --> 2:21:59.420]  Forecast that we continue down the economic road. We're on globally with the ongoing covet 19 lockdowns and the structure to productivity
[2:21:59.420 --> 2:22:04.380]  It will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will
[2:22:04.780 --> 2:22:10.060]  Starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human infrastructure
[2:22:10.700 --> 2:22:16.540]  That's been built. It will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first world in even deeper debt
[2:22:16.860 --> 2:22:23.420]  Which we're being maneuvered into so I really think the smart move is to end all these lockdowns immediately
[2:22:23.420 --> 2:22:29.500]  And prosecute the people that launched the giant covet scam the giant covet con game
[2:22:29.740 --> 2:22:31.580]  There's really just a big power grab
[2:22:31.580 --> 2:22:33.340]  But in case we can't reverse all this
[2:22:33.340 --> 2:22:38.380]  We better start digging in and get storeable food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient because that's the name of their game
[2:22:38.380 --> 2:22:42.780]  Is to make us dependent on them. So get self-sufficient now in full wars dot com
[2:22:43.900 --> 2:22:49.500]  I talk about all the horrible things that are happening and I point out that the globalist are eugenics death goal because it's true
[2:22:49.500 --> 2:22:53.340]  I don't say it to scare you a lot. People say man. This show is dark
[2:22:54.140 --> 2:22:57.100]  Well, you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat it
[2:22:57.820 --> 2:23:03.340]  And if we just listen to the surface of what the mwo propaganda's are saying they have reasons to sell
[2:23:03.820 --> 2:23:07.980]  This garbage to the general public. But if you just scratch the surface, they're so arrogant
[2:23:08.300 --> 2:23:13.820]  They've all written to tell blueprints of this plan and more and more being honest about it
[2:23:14.460 --> 2:23:16.220]  because there comes a point
[2:23:16.220 --> 2:23:20.460]  Whereas david eich says they have to stop hiding it and start selling it
[2:23:21.180 --> 2:23:23.500]  So we're at the point of the emergence now
[2:23:24.060 --> 2:23:26.700]  And it's coming out in the open and some people
[2:23:27.740 --> 2:23:32.380]  Under mass dot com syndrome are going to submit to any level of tyranny, but others are going to fight
[2:23:33.260 --> 2:23:37.820]  This isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it be okay
[2:23:37.820 --> 2:23:46.620]  No, this thing is post human and exterminism research. What that is
[2:23:47.020 --> 2:23:49.740]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:49.740 --> 2:24:08.860]  Holy
[2:24:19.740 --> 2:24:26.820]  Well, the Hodges twins are here and they were getting into how they're starting to be censored
[2:24:26.820 --> 2:24:31.420]  by Facebook or platforms, election meddling, gentlemen, I got a hundred questions and then
[2:24:31.420 --> 2:24:33.300]  a hundred more.
[2:24:33.300 --> 2:24:37.540]  But with all that's going on in the world, you hit on something.
[2:24:37.540 --> 2:24:40.420]  I know you don't take pleasure in it, neither do I.
[2:24:40.420 --> 2:24:43.380]  The Liberals I used to know were anti-offensive war.
[2:24:43.380 --> 2:24:45.380]  Well, Trump's getting us out of all these wars.
[2:24:45.380 --> 2:24:48.580]  The Liberals I used to know wanted to empower the average people, well, Trump's trying to
[2:24:48.580 --> 2:24:49.580]  do that.
[2:24:49.580 --> 2:24:53.580]  The New Liberal is not the Liberal I knew 30 years ago, 20 years ago.
[2:24:53.580 --> 2:24:57.900]  They're like a crazed demon that's super stupid.
[2:24:57.900 --> 2:25:00.660]  So you were making that point about how weird they are.
[2:25:00.660 --> 2:25:05.900]  What do you think happened to America or what happened to these people?
[2:25:05.900 --> 2:25:12.980]  They're leftist now, but you know what shifted everything was when politicians in the mainstream
[2:25:12.980 --> 2:25:19.620]  media got on TV and called our president a white supremacist, that the red hat was the
[2:25:19.620 --> 2:25:21.500]  new KKK hood.
[2:25:21.500 --> 2:25:26.740]  That's very powerful for somebody to see in the mirror because when they see people on
[2:25:26.740 --> 2:25:32.300]  the news, they say this person is somebody of power, I should listen to him.
[2:25:32.300 --> 2:25:36.620]  He's on TV, he's in a suit, so they take that word for it and they don't realize that they're
[2:25:36.620 --> 2:25:37.900]  being lied to.
[2:25:37.900 --> 2:25:41.220]  That's why the Liberals no longer Liberal, they're leftist.
[2:25:41.220 --> 2:25:47.140]  And how irresponsible for another politician, a member of our government, that's supposed
[2:25:47.140 --> 2:25:50.420]  to be working in tandem as a team.
[2:25:50.420 --> 2:25:56.380]  How can yet person after the oaths they've taken standing on TV and call a man a racist
[2:25:56.380 --> 2:26:00.580]  when they eat your boss, when y'all should be working together, you have absolutely
[2:26:00.580 --> 2:26:07.300]  no proof that this man is a racist and say those things on TV and they say Trump is the
[2:26:07.300 --> 2:26:08.300]  bad guy.
[2:26:08.300 --> 2:26:09.300]  He's the provocateur.
[2:26:09.300 --> 2:26:10.300]  Yeah.
[2:26:10.300 --> 2:26:14.980]  This man's been in the public eye for decades and you can't find anything on this man.
[2:26:14.980 --> 2:26:19.140]  He bought up all the golf courses that hard to believe didn't allow black people and Jews
[2:26:19.140 --> 2:26:20.940]  on him and he opened it up.
[2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:21.940]  He did the opposite.
[2:26:21.940 --> 2:26:22.940]  Right.
[2:26:22.940 --> 2:26:28.020]  He's got wards from Jesse Jackson out shopping for helping black, but overnight he's running
[2:26:28.020 --> 2:26:29.020]  for president.
[2:26:29.020 --> 2:26:30.420]  Now he's a white supremacist.
[2:26:30.420 --> 2:26:32.740]  Not only that, he's a Nazi.
[2:26:32.740 --> 2:26:36.740]  But I asked that question because I really didn't know the answer and you guys just spelled
[2:26:36.740 --> 2:26:37.740]  it out.
[2:26:37.740 --> 2:26:44.740]  It's the leadership Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Michael Moore, Bill Clinton, all of them Obama
[2:26:44.740 --> 2:26:46.900]  saying Trump is a white supremacist.
[2:26:46.900 --> 2:26:50.620]  Well, people then believe the authority figure and believe this is a Nazi.
[2:26:50.620 --> 2:26:54.180]  So she says, if you see him go after him, well, now that's what's happening.
[2:26:54.180 --> 2:26:55.180]  And so you're right.
[2:26:55.180 --> 2:26:58.820]  It's the leadership of the Democrats that are commanding this and doing it all.
[2:26:58.820 --> 2:26:59.820]  Yeah.
[2:26:59.820 --> 2:27:03.060]  Maxine Waters, he said it herself, get in their face.
[2:27:03.060 --> 2:27:05.540]  They come in your restaurant, throw them out.
[2:27:05.540 --> 2:27:06.700]  Let them know you know they're there.
[2:27:06.700 --> 2:27:09.300]  Yeah, I mean, this all started from the left.
[2:27:09.300 --> 2:27:15.180]  But every day when you turn on mainstream media, everything's Trump's fault.
[2:27:15.180 --> 2:27:16.180]  Everything.
[2:27:16.180 --> 2:27:22.100]  The coronavirus, the Chinese virus, the rise, the rates rising and murders in our inner
[2:27:22.100 --> 2:27:25.380]  cities and all the crime that's being committed.
[2:27:25.380 --> 2:27:30.700]  It's Trump's fault when everybody that's committing those crimes are progressives and liberals.
[2:27:30.700 --> 2:27:34.580]  They live in these liberal shitholes, but it's a Republican's fault.
[2:27:34.580 --> 2:27:38.700]  A man who's only been in office a little under four years, the things he's accomplished.
[2:27:38.700 --> 2:27:39.700]  Yeah.
[2:27:39.700 --> 2:27:43.500]  You have been voting for these Democrats for years and nothing in your life has changed.
[2:27:43.500 --> 2:27:47.580]  But it's one man's fault who's been in office a little under four years.
[2:27:47.580 --> 2:27:49.540]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[2:27:49.540 --> 2:27:50.900]  Well, that's the thing for me.
[2:27:50.900 --> 2:27:53.540]  I don't even like defending somebody as much as I defend Trump.
[2:27:53.540 --> 2:27:55.940]  It feels weird, but he just keeps telling the truth.
[2:27:55.940 --> 2:27:57.440]  I know the facts.
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:27:59.140]  The guy's super truthful.
[2:27:59.140 --> 2:28:02.020]  He's got incredible energy and they keep lying about it.
[2:28:02.020 --> 2:28:06.660]  So I find myself just totally rooting for him and really freaked out and I saw him almost
[2:28:06.660 --> 2:28:10.060]  start crying yesterday in Michigan when everybody was saying, we love you.
[2:28:10.060 --> 2:28:11.060]  We love you.
[2:28:11.060 --> 2:28:16.140]  He needs that support because could you imagine being 74 and surrounded by all these people
[2:28:16.140 --> 2:28:17.140]  and what this is like?
[2:28:17.140 --> 2:28:19.060]  I mean, my God, we need to pray for President Trump.
[2:28:19.060 --> 2:28:20.060]  Yeah.
[2:28:20.060 --> 2:28:21.060]  Yeah.
[2:28:21.060 --> 2:28:25.460]  I mean, to be under attack every day on TV, Twitter, he's traveling all over the world
[2:28:25.460 --> 2:28:27.620]  to keep this movement going.
[2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:30.580]  And the snakes inside the White House that are backstabbing.
[2:28:30.580 --> 2:28:31.580]  Yeah.
[2:28:31.580 --> 2:28:35.580]  I mean, it's, it's crazy what this man's going through and he's still standing tall
[2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:36.580]  for us all.
[2:28:36.580 --> 2:28:41.980]  And he's going to his rallies and the man is so sharp and then you look at Joe Biden.
[2:28:41.980 --> 2:28:45.220]  It's like night and day.
[2:28:45.220 --> 2:28:49.300]  It's amazing how any, how Joe Biden has to support.
[2:28:49.300 --> 2:28:50.300]  He does.
[2:28:50.300 --> 2:28:51.360]  That's my next question.
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:52.740]  What were they thinking with Joe Biden?
[2:28:52.740 --> 2:28:55.860]  I mean, he is degenerating quickly.
[2:28:55.860 --> 2:28:56.860]  Yeah.
[2:28:56.860 --> 2:28:58.380]  That's the thing, man.
[2:28:58.380 --> 2:28:59.380]  They ain't thinking.
[2:28:59.380 --> 2:29:02.660]  I mean, it's like the liberal has lost their mind.
[2:29:02.660 --> 2:29:06.620]  It's, it's just, they think the only way they can beat Trump is Joe Biden, which is
[2:29:06.620 --> 2:29:07.620]  pretty sad.
[2:29:07.620 --> 2:29:08.620]  Yeah.
[2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:09.620]  Let me use this analogy.
[2:29:09.620 --> 2:29:14.980]  It's like putting Mike Tyson in 1988 in the ring with a guy in a wheelchair.
[2:29:14.980 --> 2:29:20.100]  I mean, this is like mentally, Trump's like Mike Tyson in his prime and Biden's like a
[2:29:20.100 --> 2:29:22.660]  80 year old man that I don't even know what planet he's on.
[2:29:22.660 --> 2:29:23.660]  Yeah.
[2:29:23.660 --> 2:29:24.660]  Putting it nice, Alex.
[2:29:24.660 --> 2:29:25.660]  Yeah.
[2:29:25.660 --> 2:29:28.500]  And he chooses his VP as somebody nobody likes.
[2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:30.020]  Not even black people like her.
[2:29:30.020 --> 2:29:31.020]  Yeah.
[2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:33.820]  I was about to say, she pulled the lowest with black people.
[2:29:33.820 --> 2:29:34.820]  Why the hell they did?
[2:29:34.820 --> 2:29:35.820]  Yeah.
[2:29:35.820 --> 2:29:41.820]  I don't, the liberal, the modern liberal, Alex does not think yet.
[2:29:41.820 --> 2:29:44.620]  They only picked her because she's supposedly black.
[2:29:44.620 --> 2:29:45.620]  She's not black.
[2:29:45.620 --> 2:29:48.340]  She's Indian, but she is not black.
[2:29:48.340 --> 2:29:52.180]  She bought as black as Sean King, Alex.
[2:29:52.180 --> 2:29:53.500]  I was going to ask that.
[2:29:53.500 --> 2:29:55.660]  What is up with Sean King and Denzel?
[2:29:55.660 --> 2:30:01.220]  All these weirdos that obviously are not black and they say they are and it comes out that
[2:30:01.220 --> 2:30:02.220]  they're not.
[2:30:02.220 --> 2:30:03.780]  And they go, well, I identify as that.
[2:30:03.780 --> 2:30:06.300]  I guess it's like men identify as women or whatever.
[2:30:06.300 --> 2:30:07.300]  Yeah.
[2:30:07.300 --> 2:30:08.300]  Yeah.
[2:30:08.300 --> 2:30:09.300]  You know what?
[2:30:09.300 --> 2:30:10.300]  And Trevor Noah brought that up on his podcast.
[2:30:10.300 --> 2:30:13.260]  He said it's okay for a child to pick his gender.
[2:30:13.260 --> 2:30:14.260]  Yeah.
[2:30:14.260 --> 2:30:16.340]  But it's not okay for somebody to pick the race.
[2:30:16.340 --> 2:30:17.340]  Yeah.
[2:30:17.340 --> 2:30:20.540]  A grown adult identifying as another race, that's a lie.
[2:30:20.540 --> 2:30:24.260]  But a child at six, seven years old can pick their own gender.
[2:30:24.260 --> 2:30:25.260]  That's not a lie.
[2:30:25.260 --> 2:30:30.020]  I mean, everybody in Hollywood, celebrities, football players, they do not think.
[2:30:30.020 --> 2:30:35.460]  And the only reason why these people are on your TV is because it's some leftist there
[2:30:35.460 --> 2:30:36.740]  pushing their agenda.
[2:30:36.740 --> 2:30:37.740]  Yeah.
[2:30:37.740 --> 2:30:38.740]  You can't pick your gender.
[2:30:38.740 --> 2:30:40.060]  You can't pick your race.
[2:30:40.060 --> 2:30:41.060]  Yeah.
[2:30:41.060 --> 2:30:44.740]  If you can pick your gender, I would say you could pick your race if you wanted to.
[2:30:44.740 --> 2:30:45.740]  Yeah.
[2:30:45.740 --> 2:30:48.180]  But at the end of the day, you can't pick your gender and you can't pick your race.
[2:30:48.180 --> 2:30:52.140]  And I'm like thinking, Alex, who is making these rules?
[2:30:52.140 --> 2:30:58.620]  Some satanic worshipping leftists in Hollywood, some elite is putting, making all these stupid
[2:30:58.620 --> 2:30:59.620]  ridiculous rules.
[2:30:59.620 --> 2:31:01.100]  Makes absolutely no sense.
[2:31:01.100 --> 2:31:02.100]  No, I totally agree.
[2:31:02.100 --> 2:31:03.100]  But you look at Sean King.
[2:31:03.100 --> 2:31:04.660]  I mean, he is fake, man.
[2:31:04.660 --> 2:31:05.660]  Yeah.
[2:31:05.660 --> 2:31:10.020]  I mean, Trevor Noah grew his hair out like he's locked in his house during the lockdown.
[2:31:10.020 --> 2:31:11.020]  Yeah.
[2:31:11.020 --> 2:31:14.780]  If he had now, I mean, this is, and so did, so did Colbert.
[2:31:14.780 --> 2:31:16.180]  I mean, it's just all fake.
[2:31:16.180 --> 2:31:17.180]  Yeah.
[2:31:17.180 --> 2:31:21.420]  It's fake, but what's crazy is Alex, their fans, they don't see it.
[2:31:21.420 --> 2:31:22.420]  Yeah.
[2:31:22.420 --> 2:31:25.020]  It's like right there in the face, they don't even see it.
[2:31:25.020 --> 2:31:33.180]  It's like, I'm telling you, the voter that votes left now, they're capable of thinking
[2:31:33.180 --> 2:31:34.180]  for themselves.
[2:31:34.180 --> 2:31:36.340]  They just follow whatever the TV tells them.
[2:31:36.340 --> 2:31:39.300]  That's why a majority of people that are conservative from Republicans, their business
[2:31:39.300 --> 2:31:43.700]  owners, their leaders, their capitalists, they think for themselves, they're entrepreneurs.
[2:31:43.700 --> 2:31:44.700]  Yeah.
[2:31:44.700 --> 2:31:45.700]  That's people on the left.
[2:31:45.700 --> 2:31:49.100]  They think that this society is oppressing them, that they're...
[2:31:49.100 --> 2:31:51.980]  Well, if you're running your own business, you better know how stuff actually works.
[2:31:51.980 --> 2:31:52.980]  You're not going to be in business.
[2:31:52.980 --> 2:31:53.980]  Oh, yeah.
[2:31:53.980 --> 2:31:54.980]  Yeah.
[2:31:54.980 --> 2:31:56.740]  That's why Kamala Harris is so out of touch.
[2:31:56.740 --> 2:31:59.020]  That's why most of these Democrats are so out of touch.
[2:31:59.020 --> 2:32:01.340]  They can't function in real day-to-day society.
[2:32:01.340 --> 2:32:02.340]  Yeah.
[2:32:02.340 --> 2:32:03.340]  They don't know how to run their own business.
[2:32:03.340 --> 2:32:04.340]  They wouldn't be able to.
[2:32:04.340 --> 2:32:09.020]  They just know how to lie and spew lies and make money off the taxpayers' back.
[2:32:09.020 --> 2:32:13.780]  Everybody should know, especially an entrepreneur business owner, you cannot invest millions
[2:32:13.780 --> 2:32:17.700]  of dollars, hundreds of thousands of billions of dollars, and be able to share that equally.
[2:32:17.700 --> 2:32:20.540]  50 businesses do not work like that.
[2:32:20.540 --> 2:32:21.540]  Socialism does not work.
[2:32:21.540 --> 2:32:22.540]  Well, sure.
[2:32:22.540 --> 2:32:23.700]  They'll talk about some billionaire's wealth.
[2:32:23.700 --> 2:32:26.500]  That's always in the business and all the infrastructure.
[2:32:26.500 --> 2:32:29.580]  All the real billionaires, like Elon Musk, he barely has any real cash.
[2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:30.580]  It's the value of his stock.
[2:32:30.580 --> 2:32:33.820]  If he tried to cash out 5%, he'd go bankrupt.
[2:32:33.820 --> 2:32:34.820]  Yeah.
[2:32:34.820 --> 2:32:35.820]  Right.
[2:32:35.820 --> 2:32:36.820]  Yeah.
[2:32:36.820 --> 2:32:37.820]  His business is inflated.
[2:32:37.820 --> 2:32:38.820]  Yeah.
[2:32:38.820 --> 2:32:39.820]  People don't know that.
[2:32:39.820 --> 2:32:40.820]  That like...
[2:32:40.820 --> 2:32:44.540]  You know, because like one time they said, oh, Jones's business was valued in court case
[2:32:44.540 --> 2:32:45.540]  by 80 million.
[2:32:45.540 --> 2:32:49.580]  I have people going, you got $80 million, I go, I don't have $2 million, they value
[2:32:49.580 --> 2:32:50.580]  it at that.
[2:32:50.580 --> 2:32:52.580]  It doesn't mean it actually has that value.
[2:32:52.580 --> 2:32:53.580]  Right.
[2:32:53.580 --> 2:32:54.580]  You have to liquidate.
[2:32:54.580 --> 2:32:55.580]  Yeah.
[2:32:55.580 --> 2:32:59.540]  And some of these people just say, they spread lies, just like they said, Amazon doesn't
[2:32:59.540 --> 2:33:00.540]  pay any taxes.
[2:33:00.540 --> 2:33:01.540]  Come on now.
[2:33:01.540 --> 2:33:02.540]  They don't pay no taxes.
[2:33:02.540 --> 2:33:03.540]  Yeah.
[2:33:03.540 --> 2:33:06.780]  And people believe that, but people believe it because they don't know how to think for
[2:33:06.780 --> 2:33:07.780]  themselves.
[2:33:07.780 --> 2:33:08.780]  They just take them for the word.
[2:33:08.780 --> 2:33:12.140]  Well, guys, I want to come back and get in the final segment.
[2:33:12.140 --> 2:33:13.140]  What you...
[2:33:13.140 --> 2:33:14.140]  Again, I said this and then I diverted you.
[2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:15.140]  Sorry.
[2:33:15.140 --> 2:33:16.140]  What President Trump should do.
[2:33:16.140 --> 2:33:19.700]  Because he listens to you guys and I know we put pressure on the last six months to get
[2:33:19.700 --> 2:33:20.700]  more hardcore.
[2:33:20.700 --> 2:33:21.700]  He did.
[2:33:21.700 --> 2:33:22.700]  He went up in the polls.
[2:33:22.700 --> 2:33:23.700]  Even though we know those polls are fake.
[2:33:23.700 --> 2:33:24.700]  The point is...
[2:33:24.700 --> 2:33:25.700]  Right.
[2:33:25.700 --> 2:33:26.700]  What do you guys think President Trump should do?
[2:33:26.700 --> 2:33:30.620]  The Hodge Twins are here, conservative twins on YouTube, Instagram official Hodge Twins
[2:33:30.620 --> 2:33:31.620]  on Twitter.
[2:33:31.620 --> 2:33:33.700]  Hodge Twins, you want to follow them?
[2:33:33.700 --> 2:33:34.700]  You want to support them?
[2:33:34.700 --> 2:33:36.180]  I know I'm getting one of those T-shirts.
[2:33:36.180 --> 2:33:37.180]  Those are good looking.
[2:33:37.180 --> 2:33:38.180]  We'll be right back.
[2:33:38.180 --> 2:33:43.180]  Stay with us.
[2:33:43.180 --> 2:33:46.700]  It couldn't have been scripted any better.
[2:33:46.700 --> 2:33:51.580]  That's because it was completely scripted and we even know the names of the United
[2:33:51.580 --> 2:33:57.540]  Nations Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Mollin Decades and John Hopkins Toppings.
[2:33:57.540 --> 2:34:02.500]  We have the script just like you'd have for a Hollywood movie and it's designed to free
[2:34:02.500 --> 2:34:11.020]  civilization and have a post-Renaissance stagnation or new dark age and a total consolidation
[2:34:11.020 --> 2:34:16.380]  of all wealth and power in the hands of the kleptocratic post-humanist.
[2:34:16.380 --> 2:34:21.140]  The magnitude of this is unfathomable, but you can see all the check boxes of tyranny
[2:34:21.140 --> 2:34:22.740]  are being marked carefully.
[2:34:22.740 --> 2:34:28.220]  Every eye dotted, every T crossed, a total societal vertical integration takeover, medical
[2:34:28.220 --> 2:34:29.820]  tyranny, total surveillance.
[2:34:29.820 --> 2:34:33.780]  The big tech heads on average have had their wealth cook up 35% in the last eight months.
[2:34:33.780 --> 2:34:37.260]  And of course, Jeff Bezos has basically doubled his.
[2:34:37.260 --> 2:34:40.540]  Everyone is being forced onto their system to post-human robot takeover.
[2:34:40.540 --> 2:34:48.980]  They're being made obsolete in Germany, in Australia, in Canada, and now even in Ohio.
[2:34:48.980 --> 2:34:56.340]  Every blue state, every blue city is announcing that they are establishing emergency COVID
[2:34:56.340 --> 2:35:01.780]  centers for people that refuse to be tested or people that are tested but refuse to stay
[2:35:01.780 --> 2:35:07.060]  in place while the results are coming back or those that supposedly break quarantine.
[2:35:07.060 --> 2:35:12.060]  This of course is all based on the tests that are over 90% fraudulent and were designed
[2:35:12.060 --> 2:35:13.700]  to be so.
[2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:15.860]  This is a power grab.
[2:35:15.860 --> 2:35:19.300]  The world government globalist system is in trouble.
[2:35:19.300 --> 2:35:22.660]  All over the planet, free peoples are trying to pull out of it.
[2:35:22.660 --> 2:35:28.300]  And every blue area, I use the term blue as if in the U.S. for blue for Democrats, red
[2:35:28.300 --> 2:35:33.300]  for Republicans, is basically globalist or communist and authoritarian.
[2:35:33.300 --> 2:35:37.500]  And they are using this as their cover for an authoritarian takeover because they know
[2:35:37.500 --> 2:35:38.500]  the world's waiting to them.
[2:35:38.500 --> 2:35:40.340]  It's a very simple equation.
[2:35:40.340 --> 2:35:41.340]  It's illegal.
[2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:42.340]  We must resist it.
[2:35:42.340 --> 2:35:47.420]  You've always had a pledge for me and it's that I'll come to you with the truth, at
[2:35:47.420 --> 2:35:52.540]  least as good as my human temporal truth can get because as the Bible says, we all see
[2:35:52.540 --> 2:35:57.780]  through a rose-colored, darkly, kind of a foggy lens that distorts what we actually
[2:35:57.780 --> 2:36:01.780]  can perceive so that everything we do is actually a fallen sin.
[2:36:01.780 --> 2:36:04.660]  What we do is actually a twisted distortion of God's will.
[2:36:04.660 --> 2:36:08.740]  So when I tell you I'm telling you the truth, it's the best truth this fallen creature's
[2:36:08.740 --> 2:36:09.740]  got.
[2:36:09.740 --> 2:36:11.740]  But I'll tell you, it's all I got.
[2:36:11.740 --> 2:36:16.540]  And when I tell you, this country and the world is under a major satanic threat, you
[2:36:16.540 --> 2:36:18.620]  don't need me to tell you that.
[2:36:18.620 --> 2:36:19.620]  You can look out the window.
[2:36:19.620 --> 2:36:21.140]  You can look into your own family.
[2:36:21.140 --> 2:36:22.140]  You can turn on the news.
[2:36:22.140 --> 2:36:23.140]  You can see it.
[2:36:23.140 --> 2:36:25.140]  But you've got this commitment.
[2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:27.140]  I do recognize the truth of God.
[2:36:27.140 --> 2:36:28.140]  So do you.
[2:36:28.140 --> 2:36:29.140]  We're going to win this fight, but it's going to be hard.
[2:36:29.140 --> 2:36:34.820]  And I want to keep InfoWars in the main position to fight, and it only happens when you support
[2:36:34.820 --> 2:36:35.820]  what you've been doing.
[2:36:35.820 --> 2:36:41.180]  So again, I thank you, but go to InfoWarsTour.com, buy the product, spread the word, because
[2:36:41.180 --> 2:36:42.180]  that's how we're going to win.
[2:36:42.180 --> 2:36:44.180]  Again, I thank you all.
[2:36:44.180 --> 2:36:48.540]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple.
[2:36:48.540 --> 2:36:55.060]  They just teach us that the architecture of civilization, that the trajectory of a species
[2:36:55.060 --> 2:37:01.220]  is designed by these ever-knowing, loving, liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit
[2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:05.060]  back and enjoy the ride, everything will be great, but then they tell us that humans
[2:37:05.060 --> 2:37:09.140]  are obsolete, not essential, and we're bad for the earth, and we need to be phased out.
[2:37:09.140 --> 2:37:15.700]  So they're very open about what they're doing, and they count on us just being very passive
[2:37:15.700 --> 2:37:20.060]  living in the matrix-like system that they're building.
[2:37:20.060 --> 2:37:25.300]  What defines humans more than anything from the rest of the, quote, animal kingdom is
[2:37:25.300 --> 2:37:27.180]  that we control our environment.
[2:37:27.180 --> 2:37:29.300]  We build our own environments.
[2:37:29.300 --> 2:37:30.620]  We create our own systems.
[2:37:30.620 --> 2:37:37.580]  We really geo-engineer and terraform the planet, and it's systems towards our aims, but instead
[2:37:37.580 --> 2:37:41.820]  we're acting like animals, and the globalists play the part of humans, and us is cattle.
[2:37:41.820 --> 2:37:46.820]  And that's the trick.
[2:37:46.820 --> 2:37:53.820]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:16.820 --> 2:38:29.180]  You know what I love about the Hodge twins, I've been watching them for years, is they've
[2:38:29.180 --> 2:38:34.740]  got that positive Americana spirit, and they're not losers, they're not victims, they're not
[2:38:34.740 --> 2:38:40.700]  laying down, and I see the left so into being victims, so hateful, I feel sorry for them,
[2:38:40.700 --> 2:38:42.140]  except they're so incredibly dangerous.
[2:38:42.140 --> 2:38:46.100]  So I watch your show all the time, I watch it, it's in my feed, I watch you guys almost
[2:38:46.100 --> 2:38:49.980]  every day, and I know my son's a big fan, a lot of the crew are fans, but you're really
[2:38:49.980 --> 2:38:50.980]  polite on the show.
[2:38:50.980 --> 2:38:54.620]  You've done a great job, but you guys get going yourselves on your own show, so spend
[2:38:54.620 --> 2:38:58.300]  the next five minutes or so with what you think Trump ought to do, anything else you
[2:38:58.300 --> 2:39:01.540]  want to say, you guys got the floor.
[2:39:01.540 --> 2:39:03.660]  I think he should just stay the course.
[2:39:03.660 --> 2:39:07.460]  Yeah, I mean, he's showing effective leadership.
[2:39:07.460 --> 2:39:10.900]  I know the mainstream media is turning them down every day, people on Twitter's turning
[2:39:10.900 --> 2:39:11.900]  them down.
[2:39:11.900 --> 2:39:16.020]  I mean, he's doing a great job, so he should just stay the course and just focus on this
[2:39:16.020 --> 2:39:17.900]  election getting reelected.
[2:39:17.900 --> 2:39:22.460]  Once he gets reelected, I think we're going to all see the real crop come out.
[2:39:22.460 --> 2:39:28.500]  I think all these riots that's been going on in Portland, all across America, BLM, and
[2:39:28.500 --> 2:39:33.380]  he's offered assistance to get these cities, you know, get these riots calmed down, get
[2:39:33.380 --> 2:39:39.340]  everybody safe, and they said, if he's sent in a National Guard, he's inciting riots.
[2:39:39.340 --> 2:39:44.380]  I'm like, there's already riots, they're already burning down buildings, people's already
[2:39:44.380 --> 2:39:47.260]  been killed, Trump's inciting riots.
[2:39:47.260 --> 2:39:53.420]  I think once he gets reelected, he'll be able to put his foot down and take this country
[2:39:53.420 --> 2:39:55.940]  in the direction that he's already got it going in.
[2:39:55.940 --> 2:40:01.260]  Yeah, but by no mistake by the imagination, Alex, this country is at a civil war.
[2:40:01.260 --> 2:40:02.260]  Nobody's saying it.
[2:40:02.260 --> 2:40:05.580]  You have these people on the left that are turning down monuments, burning down people's
[2:40:05.580 --> 2:40:10.820]  businesses, both white and black, killing both black and white people, and nobody's
[2:40:10.820 --> 2:40:14.580]  doing anything, and I think it's because the election's coming up.
[2:40:14.580 --> 2:40:17.980]  I mean, I think Trump doesn't want to, you know, actually, you know, do anything that
[2:40:17.980 --> 2:40:21.980]  could jeopardize him getting elected because I think this election is very, very important.
[2:40:21.980 --> 2:40:27.340]  But I do think once he's reelected, he needs to put his foot on the gas and get restored
[2:40:27.340 --> 2:40:31.500]  law and order in our inner cities in these liberal, ran neighborhoods.
[2:40:31.500 --> 2:40:32.500]  Yeah.
[2:40:32.500 --> 2:40:33.500]  Yeah.
[2:40:33.500 --> 2:40:35.580]  But I mean, I think he's did a great job.
[2:40:35.580 --> 2:40:40.540]  I mean, nobody's perfect, but how he's handled the coronavirus and how he handles the state
[2:40:40.540 --> 2:40:46.420]  of the union speeches, his rallies, I mean, the man has did a great job under the circumstances.
[2:40:46.420 --> 2:40:48.620]  I mean, put anybody else in his shoes.
[2:40:48.620 --> 2:40:52.220]  You think anybody else could have accomplished the things Trump has done?
[2:40:52.220 --> 2:40:56.820]  Yeah, it's like the whole time he's been in office, they've been attacking him.
[2:40:56.820 --> 2:40:57.820]  Yeah.
[2:40:57.820 --> 2:40:58.820]  I mean, with the impeachment.
[2:40:58.820 --> 2:40:59.820]  Right.
[2:40:59.820 --> 2:41:03.260]  I mean, every week, every month, there's a new attack on him.
[2:41:03.260 --> 2:41:04.260]  Yeah.
[2:41:04.260 --> 2:41:10.260]  On Twitter, he's trending Trump's hypocrisy, Trump's Nazi party, Trump lies, people die.
[2:41:10.260 --> 2:41:12.260]  I'm like, it's ridiculous.
[2:41:12.260 --> 2:41:20.180]  And it's, I find it very weird how you can blame one man for a virus that originated in
[2:41:20.180 --> 2:41:22.500]  another country.
[2:41:22.500 --> 2:41:23.500]  People forget that.
[2:41:23.500 --> 2:41:24.500]  That's a virus.
[2:41:24.500 --> 2:41:25.860]  Trump can't stop a virus.
[2:41:25.860 --> 2:41:26.860]  Yeah.
[2:41:26.860 --> 2:41:28.020]  People always say he is because of him.
[2:41:28.020 --> 2:41:29.020]  So many people died.
[2:41:29.020 --> 2:41:30.020]  Yeah.
[2:41:30.020 --> 2:41:36.620]  First of all, only 6% of the people that died from that virus, so calls was the virus.
[2:41:36.620 --> 2:41:37.620]  Right.
[2:41:37.620 --> 2:41:38.620]  That's right.
[2:41:38.620 --> 2:41:42.420]  So 70% of the deaths of people over the age of 60, right?
[2:41:42.420 --> 2:41:45.260]  I mean, people like to point out how many people have died.
[2:41:45.260 --> 2:41:48.740]  What would you have done as a politician or a citizen?
[2:41:48.740 --> 2:41:49.740]  What would you have done different?
[2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:51.780]  I mean, that's the most balanced job he could.
[2:41:51.780 --> 2:41:55.980]  And since you mentioned that former CIA officer, violence will explode if Trump wins, but he
[2:41:55.980 --> 2:41:56.980]  says it'll eat.
[2:41:56.980 --> 2:41:57.980]  I agree.
[2:41:57.980 --> 2:42:01.340]  The even bigger Biden wins because the left will try to see the country is weak and try
[2:42:01.340 --> 2:42:04.740]  to totally take over seeing Biden and Kamala Harris is weak.
[2:42:04.740 --> 2:42:08.140]  I mean, that imagine if Trump loses what they're going to do.
[2:42:08.140 --> 2:42:10.020]  I think the left will go even more crazy.
[2:42:10.020 --> 2:42:11.020]  Yeah.
[2:42:11.020 --> 2:42:15.340]  Man, I mean, the mayor of Portland, the mayor of Seattle support them and then they come
[2:42:15.340 --> 2:42:17.300]  try to burn down their house.
[2:42:17.300 --> 2:42:18.300]  I mean, that's crazy.
[2:42:18.300 --> 2:42:21.380]  They asked the snake eating itself, Alex.
[2:42:21.380 --> 2:42:22.460]  They want to support.
[2:42:22.460 --> 2:42:26.620]  They want to they want to call these people peaceful protesters is not peaceful when they
[2:42:26.620 --> 2:42:27.620]  show up at your house.
[2:42:27.620 --> 2:42:28.620]  It happened in Chicago.
[2:42:28.620 --> 2:42:29.620]  Yeah.
[2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:30.620]  Chicago.
[2:42:30.620 --> 2:42:33.940]  She may have like what said, I deserve security.
[2:42:33.940 --> 2:42:36.020]  She said, I get security, but you don't.
[2:42:36.020 --> 2:42:37.020]  Yeah.
[2:42:37.020 --> 2:42:38.940]  I get to have gun protection.
[2:42:38.940 --> 2:42:39.940]  You don't.
[2:42:39.940 --> 2:42:40.940]  Yeah.
[2:42:40.940 --> 2:42:44.580]  I mean, it's just like I said, the hypocrisy from the left, if you just sit and listen
[2:42:44.580 --> 2:42:49.220]  to both sides, I don't sell anybody could be on the left, but they just go by what they
[2:42:49.220 --> 2:42:50.220]  hear.
[2:42:50.220 --> 2:42:51.220]  No, I agree.
[2:42:51.220 --> 2:42:53.900]  I think they're not self aware because they didn't run their own business when you run
[2:42:53.900 --> 2:42:58.260]  your own business, you're paying all the payroll taxes, getting the lawn cut, doing
[2:42:58.260 --> 2:43:00.740]  the regulations, the electricity, something breaks.
[2:43:00.740 --> 2:43:01.740]  You got to get lunch.
[2:43:01.740 --> 2:43:02.740]  You got to pay the taxes.
[2:43:02.740 --> 2:43:04.140]  You got to you got to get the product in.
[2:43:04.140 --> 2:43:05.780]  You got to kiss the people's ass.
[2:43:05.780 --> 2:43:08.500]  And these politicians, she's like, well, I'm important.
[2:43:08.500 --> 2:43:10.140]  Like foot said, I get a haircut.
[2:43:10.140 --> 2:43:11.140]  You don't.
[2:43:11.140 --> 2:43:12.660]  She was, I get bodyguards.
[2:43:12.660 --> 2:43:13.660]  You don't.
[2:43:13.660 --> 2:43:17.740]  It's like in Minnesota in, what's the main city there?
[2:43:17.740 --> 2:43:18.740]  It's not St. Paul.
[2:43:18.740 --> 2:43:19.740]  It's Minneapolis.
[2:43:19.740 --> 2:43:20.740]  Yeah.
[2:43:20.740 --> 2:43:24.260]  The mayor fires the police, but goes, but I get private security a hundred thousand
[2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:26.220]  a day because I'm important.
[2:43:26.220 --> 2:43:30.820]  They say you don't get security in your house with a revolver, but, but, but he gets it.
[2:43:30.820 --> 2:43:34.780]  I mean, it's like you couldn't write more hypocritical statements.
[2:43:34.780 --> 2:43:35.780]  Yeah.
[2:43:35.780 --> 2:43:38.460]  Like, but when she went and got her done, she said, I need to get my hair done.
[2:43:38.460 --> 2:43:39.460]  I'm looking.
[2:43:39.460 --> 2:43:41.100]  I'm like, you got your hair done.
[2:43:41.100 --> 2:43:42.100]  You look a mess.
[2:43:42.100 --> 2:43:46.100]  So it's like, you just, yeah, and that's Pelosi, man.
[2:43:46.100 --> 2:43:50.940]  They, they, that those poor barbers and, and her salon owners, they've been shut down
[2:43:50.940 --> 2:43:55.220]  for so long and she has the audacity to go get her hair done while these people can't
[2:43:55.220 --> 2:43:57.620]  even support that families because of her.
[2:43:57.620 --> 2:44:00.740]  That's what I'm saying is they're not even aware of.
[2:44:00.740 --> 2:44:04.540]  Why are they not self aware?
[2:44:04.540 --> 2:44:09.820]  We into intellectually weak, Alex, they're not, they don't know how to hold that stuff
[2:44:09.820 --> 2:44:10.820]  accountable.
[2:44:10.820 --> 2:44:11.820]  They're not used to thinking for themselves.
[2:44:11.820 --> 2:44:16.940]  If you're being told what to do, if you, if you were under the impression that you did
[2:44:16.940 --> 2:44:21.380]  the person that you elect is your mother and your father and you just post the respect
[2:44:21.380 --> 2:44:24.260]  and do whatever they say, you can't think for yourself.
[2:44:24.260 --> 2:44:28.780]  You're going to go through your life behaving like a small child and the part, the left,
[2:44:28.780 --> 2:44:33.660]  the politicians just lie and the hypocrisy hypocrisy is so much they can't even remember
[2:44:33.660 --> 2:44:35.100]  what they said the week before.
[2:44:35.100 --> 2:44:40.300]  So they, so they contradict, you just said it, they contradict and they act like a small
[2:44:40.300 --> 2:44:41.780]  child their whole life.
[2:44:41.780 --> 2:44:42.780]  Yeah.
[2:44:42.780 --> 2:44:47.100]  And the thing about Trump, man, what I really love about him, he does not point the finger
[2:44:47.100 --> 2:44:52.420]  at anybody until he wants to make a comparison with what he's done compared to other administrations.
[2:44:52.420 --> 2:44:55.060]  You look at everybody on left, it's always your fault.
[2:44:55.060 --> 2:44:59.500]  But when Trump explains things, he will only point the finger when he wants to make a comparison.
[2:44:59.500 --> 2:45:04.780]  But I've done, and with the previous administration, he used it to give constructive criticism.
[2:45:04.780 --> 2:45:05.780]  Oh, that's it.
[2:45:05.780 --> 2:45:09.420]  200 years of Democrat rule, how did that help black folks?
[2:45:09.420 --> 2:45:12.340]  And then meanwhile, three years of Trump rule, how did it help?
[2:45:12.340 --> 2:45:14.060]  I mean, people can see the proof right there.
[2:45:14.060 --> 2:45:15.060]  Yeah.
[2:45:15.060 --> 2:45:18.780]  Biden's been in a politician for what, 40, 50 years, and now all of a sudden he's going
[2:45:18.780 --> 2:45:19.780]  to help black people.
[2:45:19.780 --> 2:45:21.900]  Now all of a sudden he's going to do prison reform.
[2:45:21.900 --> 2:45:24.260]  All of a sudden now he's going to do police and reform.
[2:45:24.260 --> 2:45:25.820]  You had 40 years to do this.
[2:45:25.820 --> 2:45:29.260]  You had a black man as your president and you didn't do anything.
[2:45:29.260 --> 2:45:30.860]  We don't need police reform.
[2:45:30.860 --> 2:45:33.500]  People should learn how to act around police officers.
[2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:36.020]  I agree, but remember how Obama wouldn't even visit black neighborhoods?
[2:45:36.020 --> 2:45:37.020]  Why was that?
[2:45:37.020 --> 2:45:40.220]  And then Trump does.
[2:45:40.220 --> 2:45:42.220]  Because he knows it's not safe.
[2:45:42.220 --> 2:45:45.060]  And he caught on with them black people.
[2:45:45.060 --> 2:45:47.900]  Trump got balls now.
[2:45:47.900 --> 2:45:48.900]  Yeah.
[2:45:48.900 --> 2:45:49.900]  Trump, look what Trump did.
[2:45:49.900 --> 2:45:52.140]  He went to see Kim Jong-un, Rocket Man.
[2:45:52.140 --> 2:45:53.940]  No president's ever done that.
[2:45:53.940 --> 2:45:55.460]  President Trump is a real leader.
[2:45:55.460 --> 2:45:56.460]  Yeah.
[2:45:56.460 --> 2:45:57.460]  Point blank.
[2:45:57.460 --> 2:46:00.540]  He's got a secret service and they say Trump will go into, not to be scared of black folks,
[2:46:00.540 --> 2:46:04.340]  but a big black church or anywhere, and he's just, don't let him really check everybody.
[2:46:04.340 --> 2:46:06.740]  Trump just goes in there, which makes me worry about him, actually.
[2:46:06.740 --> 2:46:10.140]  What happens, God forbid, if somebody kills him, though, then you know about a real civil
[2:46:10.140 --> 2:46:11.140]  war.
[2:46:11.140 --> 2:46:14.580]  Oh, man, they don't want that.
[2:46:14.580 --> 2:46:16.740]  It's impossible to kill a president these days.
[2:46:16.740 --> 2:46:17.740]  Hopefully.
[2:46:17.740 --> 2:46:18.740]  Yeah.
[2:46:18.740 --> 2:46:19.740]  Hopefully.
[2:46:19.740 --> 2:46:20.740]  If that, no.
[2:46:20.740 --> 2:46:24.460]  As long as he's not rolling around on a convertible during the parade, he should be fine.
[2:46:24.460 --> 2:46:25.460]  Don't pull a JFK.
[2:46:25.460 --> 2:46:26.940]  Hey, I'm right here.
[2:46:26.940 --> 2:46:28.220]  You guys are kicking ass.
[2:46:28.220 --> 2:46:29.220]  We love you.
[2:46:29.220 --> 2:46:30.220]  We appreciate you.
[2:46:30.220 --> 2:46:32.140]  Hodge Twins, thank you for all you're doing.
[2:46:32.140 --> 2:46:33.140]  Everybody should visit you.
[2:46:33.140 --> 2:46:34.140]  Thank you.
[2:46:34.140 --> 2:46:36.340]  They should visit your site and bookmark in case you get censored on big platforms, and
[2:46:36.340 --> 2:46:37.340]  we love what you're doing.
[2:46:37.340 --> 2:46:38.340]  Thank you.
[2:46:38.340 --> 2:46:39.340]  God bless you.
[2:46:39.340 --> 2:46:40.340]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:46:40.340 --> 2:46:41.340]  Thank you.
[2:46:41.340 --> 2:46:43.660]  Man, those are our brothers in the fight to restore the republic.
[2:46:43.660 --> 2:46:44.660]  We love them.
[2:46:44.660 --> 2:46:48.380]  The Hodge Twins, they're not scared to come on here, which shows they're even more Americana
[2:46:48.380 --> 2:46:49.380]  than we can imagine.
[2:46:49.380 --> 2:46:50.380]  All right.
[2:46:50.380 --> 2:46:53.140]  I'm going to do a few segments and then the next guest host is taking over, but I got
[2:46:53.140 --> 2:46:56.740]  some other news I need to hit, and I also need to pay some bills, and their t-shirts
[2:46:56.740 --> 2:46:57.740]  are awesome.
[2:46:57.740 --> 2:46:58.740]  I'm out of line.
[2:46:58.740 --> 2:46:59.740]  I'm actually jealous.
[2:46:59.740 --> 2:47:01.100]  We've got our new ones in, though, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:47:01.100 --> 2:47:02.300]  A listener sent me this design.
[2:47:02.300 --> 2:47:05.900]  I put it out, and it is, I got a bunch of new designs.
[2:47:05.900 --> 2:47:06.900]  Just came in.
[2:47:06.900 --> 2:47:07.900]  I'm just showing you.
[2:47:07.900 --> 2:47:08.900]  We actually have these in stock.
[2:47:08.900 --> 2:47:09.900]  Look at this baby right here.
[2:47:09.900 --> 2:47:17.900]  A rest, Fauci, and gates, and it's like dego blue with a deglow blue with a yellow, and
[2:47:17.900 --> 2:47:20.460]  it says mass-free zone on the back.
[2:47:20.460 --> 2:47:26.300]  We've got that, and we've got this new shirt as well.
[2:47:26.300 --> 2:47:28.060]  People like something on the back of a shirt.
[2:47:28.060 --> 2:47:32.660]  This is got it on the back of the shirt, and it's got don't tread on me on the back, an
[2:47:32.660 --> 2:47:37.500]  info war shield on the front, and then we've got all these other new shirts that have come
[2:47:37.500 --> 2:47:41.900]  in as well that don't tread on me front and back with a navy blue, but let me tell you
[2:47:41.900 --> 2:47:45.180]  what I'm really proud of, and they're coming in Monday.
[2:47:45.180 --> 2:47:51.020]  They've been printed right here in Texas, and that is Joe Biden for nursing home, and
[2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:53.540]  obviously, once he loses, we're not going to sell anymore.
[2:47:53.540 --> 2:47:59.300]  It's 1776 plus free shipping, all apparel is 1776 plus free shipping.
[2:47:59.300 --> 2:48:01.700]  We had the famous Hillary for Prison shirt everybody imitated.
[2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:02.700]  That's great.
[2:48:02.700 --> 2:48:05.860]  Well, this is the Biden for nursing home shirt.
[2:48:05.860 --> 2:48:07.060]  The shirts come in Monday.
[2:48:07.060 --> 2:48:11.140]  They'll be shipped out to you, and that's it, because we're only going to do a limited
[2:48:11.140 --> 2:48:12.140]  run of these.
[2:48:12.140 --> 2:48:16.260]  We're not going to sell these after the election, obviously, especially if Biden wins.
[2:48:16.260 --> 2:48:18.460]  I think I'm going to go jump off a cliff.
[2:48:18.460 --> 2:48:20.340]  That's hypothetical, folks.
[2:48:20.340 --> 2:48:21.340]  I'm joking.
[2:48:21.340 --> 2:48:22.340]  I'm not going to jump off any cliffs.
[2:48:22.340 --> 2:48:23.740]  I'll never commit suicide.
[2:48:23.740 --> 2:48:24.740]  All right.
[2:48:24.740 --> 2:48:28.340]  Fourth hour straight ahead, fourth hour straight ahead.
[2:48:28.340 --> 2:48:33.820]  I'll finish up, and then Nick Buckets.
[2:48:33.820 --> 2:48:39.020]  There is a metaphysical rule that God has put in place that controls the universe, and
[2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:40.700]  it's free will.
[2:48:40.700 --> 2:48:45.340]  That's why the social engineers, the robber barons, the globalists, the post-humanists,
[2:48:45.340 --> 2:48:51.940]  the anti-humans openly tell you what they're doing, and openly tell you that your work
[2:48:51.940 --> 2:48:55.980]  will soon crap and you need to die, because that will save the earth, and they do everything
[2:48:55.980 --> 2:49:01.340]  they can to make the most dystopian, ugly future they can in the movies and in the culture
[2:49:01.340 --> 2:49:03.500]  and in all the different publications.
[2:49:03.500 --> 2:49:07.580]  They are making you hate yourself, they are making you be depressed, they are making you
[2:49:07.580 --> 2:49:11.180]  not have a connection to God because they just want you to die so they can selfishly
[2:49:11.180 --> 2:49:13.900]  control the future, and that's what all this is about.
[2:49:13.900 --> 2:49:18.460]  They say they're setting up world government to protect us all from our super technologies.
[2:49:18.460 --> 2:49:22.500]  While they're the ones running around like mad scientists, endangering the whole planet
[2:49:22.500 --> 2:49:27.980]  with a lot of these technologies, the globalists are what is disruptive to human species.
[2:49:27.980 --> 2:49:35.340]  They call us disruptive to their power grab, it's time to say no.
[2:49:35.340 --> 2:49:40.220]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good
[2:49:40.220 --> 2:49:45.780]  for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep,

[2:51:04.660 --> 2:51:06.980]  on for this last hour.
[2:51:06.980 --> 2:51:12.700]  Okay, Dr. Dick Beggars has taken over in about 10 minutes, I've got a few final things I
[2:51:12.700 --> 2:51:17.540]  want to hit, I didn't really get to this, they had over 6,000 boats on Lake Travis
[2:51:17.540 --> 2:51:22.780]  outside Austin last Saturday and I was already set to do a live show here, I didn't go out
[2:51:22.780 --> 2:51:29.300]  there, but I saw how crazy it was, I guarantee there's going to be aftershocks of that baby
[2:51:29.300 --> 2:51:33.380]  tomorrow, I bet there's 1,000 boats out there, that's what I'm guessing, so I'll be out
[2:51:33.380 --> 2:51:41.180]  there about noon to whenever, I'll do a live feed into the Implemores.com and we will break
[2:51:41.180 --> 2:51:45.060]  it all down for you because it's good to go out and celebrate, it's good to go out and
[2:51:45.060 --> 2:51:50.300]  have a good time, I see the hodge twins who I know behind the scenes and on air are always
[2:51:50.300 --> 2:51:56.420]  in a good mood and positive and that's how I want to be, cheerful about this, positive,
[2:51:56.420 --> 2:51:59.820]  moving forward even if Trump loses which I don't think is going to happen, we just keep
[2:51:59.820 --> 2:52:06.580]  fighting, the hodge twins are my spirit animal I think and I hope to be their spirit animal
[2:52:06.580 --> 2:52:12.820]  but we are all each other's inspiration is what I'm getting in here and I get down folks
[2:52:12.820 --> 2:52:16.980]  and I don't get suicidal but when I read these type of articles, this is what I want to hit
[2:52:16.980 --> 2:52:24.340]  right now, I never get suicidal, I never want to die but I actually feel weak, like I don't
[2:52:24.340 --> 2:52:27.860]  have enough energy, sometimes I'm up here at 6, 7 at night and there's a huge break
[2:52:27.860 --> 2:52:31.780]  in story and I know it's important to fight and I want to fight and the spirit's willing
[2:52:31.780 --> 2:52:39.460]  with the flesh is weak and I just kind of go, God I love you so much, I kind of know
[2:52:39.460 --> 2:52:43.180]  what it's like with my grandma at 9 years old said I'm not worried about dying and it's
[2:52:43.180 --> 2:52:48.180]  not that I even want to die, it's just that I know the purity of Christ and not being
[2:52:48.180 --> 2:52:53.300]  on this satanic plane must be amazing but see here's why you shouldn't commit suicide and
[2:52:53.300 --> 2:52:57.540]  I'm not saying I would, I don't want to, I'm not even in that same realm but I could understand
[2:52:57.540 --> 2:53:00.620]  why folks are like that because you want to punch out of here, you want to get away from
[2:53:00.620 --> 2:53:04.740]  it but listen, you're a grown man, you're a grown woman, you know what's going on, you
[2:53:04.740 --> 2:53:10.420]  have a responsibility to help innocents that aren't adults that don't know what's going
[2:53:10.420 --> 2:53:16.100]  on to protect them and so quit worrying about how upset you are about what's happening and
[2:53:16.100 --> 2:53:21.220]  start worrying about other people and it's going to be that process of worrying about
[2:53:21.220 --> 2:53:25.940]  other people or maybe it's a couple of plants you get that you take care of in your backyard
[2:53:25.940 --> 2:53:29.340]  or a dog or a cat you take care of so people that have dogs and cats don't commit suicide
[2:53:29.340 --> 2:53:35.660]  as much because you've got something that's dependent on you and so I'm not up here preaching
[2:53:35.660 --> 2:53:40.820]  to people, I mean I get why people want to punch out.
[2:53:40.820 --> 2:53:45.860]  At my level not commit suicide but just leave, not do this anymore, not stare into the face
[2:53:45.860 --> 2:53:51.700]  of evil, I mean let me tell you something, let me try to quantify this.
[2:53:51.700 --> 2:53:55.100]  Every morning I wake up at like 4 or 5 in the morning and I go I don't want to think
[2:53:55.100 --> 2:54:00.980]  about Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or Big Mike or General Mattis or Lord Rothschild
[2:54:00.980 --> 2:54:10.060]  I mean they're all or Abrina Abranovic or Tony Podesta, I mean it's like I spend my
[2:54:10.060 --> 2:54:16.100]  life looking at them and looking at Netflix pedophile stuff and you know at a certain
[2:54:16.100 --> 2:54:22.020]  point I'm like God take me out of this you know what I mean but you know what those of
[2:54:22.020 --> 2:54:26.540]  us that care and have a conscience can see this and don't like it for a reason and it's
[2:54:26.540 --> 2:54:31.460]  our job to stand up against it and say no to it and so that's all I'm getting at is
[2:54:31.460 --> 2:54:36.300]  I'm not here bitching at you, I'm not here saying you need to do more, believe me I want
[2:54:36.300 --> 2:54:40.900]  to load up in an RV and disappear, I mean if there was some new country that was half
[2:54:40.900 --> 2:54:47.140]  way free I'd be gone so fast, this is a world government AI new world order takeover and
[2:54:47.140 --> 2:54:51.860]  we're not getting out of this and I'll tell you right now I happen to know the man upstairs
[2:54:51.860 --> 2:54:56.460]  I know you all know him a little bit as well or maybe more than I do but I happen to have
[2:54:56.460 --> 2:55:04.180]  a little bit of a connection and you don't want to stand in front of God and not a fought
[2:55:04.180 --> 2:55:09.860]  to full fight but I tell you I'm a human I tell you how I faltered because I don't want
[2:55:09.860 --> 2:55:13.900]  you to think that you're weak because you don't want to fight these people and I get
[2:55:13.900 --> 2:55:17.380]  it it's not that you don't want to fight them because you're scared they're so damn gross
[2:55:17.380 --> 2:55:23.060]  man they stink spiritually they're disgusting people and I know you don't want to you want
[2:55:23.060 --> 2:55:27.300]  to focus on beautiful things and you want to you want to focus on pure things but listen
[2:55:27.300 --> 2:55:34.540]  here's the thing the pure thing is under attack because you're not fighting the evil thing
[2:55:34.540 --> 2:55:43.820]  so pull your metaphysical sword of truth and start start hacking I know I say it all the
[2:55:43.820 --> 2:55:47.180]  time but I mean it from the bottom of my heart I want to thank you the listeners viewers this
[2:55:47.180 --> 2:55:53.140]  broadcast and all the stations and all the affiliates and sponsors and my family and
[2:55:53.140 --> 2:55:58.460]  the crew and just everybody out there the listeners and viewers as you said this is
[2:55:58.460 --> 2:56:02.860]  such an epic struggle and we've all been proven dead on we've been proven we're right because
[2:56:02.860 --> 2:56:06.540]  we're being led by God we have a spirit and we're very humble about that this this is
[2:56:06.540 --> 2:56:11.540]  not us this is God working through us but man now it's so precious to stay on air I
[2:56:11.540 --> 2:56:15.420]  used to think you know maybe I'll wake a bunch of people up and I can kind of recede into
[2:56:15.420 --> 2:56:19.900]  the background because fighting this thing 18 hours a day gets a little bit old but
[2:56:19.900 --> 2:56:24.500]  now with the evil so out in the open and everything we've said being vindicated I never questioned
[2:56:24.500 --> 2:56:28.500]  what I was saying because I knew it was true but I I did question where they'd ever actually
[2:56:28.500 --> 2:56:32.180]  try to carry it all out well now we know they're going to carry it out and then some so we
[2:56:32.180 --> 2:56:36.340]  got to fight and I just really appreciate you and we're in this together and praise God
[2:56:36.340 --> 2:56:47.580]  and pass the ammunition the info war again take action folks this is it big brother mainstream
[2:56:47.580 --> 2:56:56.540]  media government cover ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the info
[2:56:56.540 --> 2:57:05.300]  wars dot com studios it's alex jones all right if I could do this once a day I do it but if
[2:57:05.300 --> 2:57:09.780]  I don't do it every couple segments will be shut down so I appreciate all the listeners
[2:57:09.780 --> 2:57:14.020]  I appreciate all the viewers and I'm about to hand the baton over to dr. Nick baggage
[2:57:14.020 --> 2:57:20.180]  I'll just explain it this way I do not treat my body well I love to eat tons of red meat
[2:57:20.180 --> 2:57:27.860]  I live super stressful life I work 15 16 hours a day and I play hard sometimes as well and
[2:57:27.860 --> 2:57:31.660]  so I tell you take the supplements we sell this is the very best out there but I routinely
[2:57:31.660 --> 2:57:38.260]  forget to take my supplements for months I'll get on them have the little lazy Susan on the
[2:57:38.260 --> 2:57:43.620]  table I'll have them right here in my studio and then they'll clean it off and for two
[2:57:43.620 --> 2:57:48.220]  months I won't take it and I'll gain 15 pounds that's how important clean pure iodine is
[2:57:48.220 --> 2:57:56.340]  with x2 or x3 or DNA force plus or these other products and so they really are great products
[2:57:56.340 --> 2:58:00.700]  but even if they were placebo even they were sugar which they're not they're their highest
[2:58:00.700 --> 2:58:05.860]  end you're gonna get they do fund this operation which is really really special so the books
[2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:11.380]  the films the water filtration the high-quality swarble food it's all an info or store.com
[2:58:11.380 --> 2:58:17.020]  and I've been asked by some smart folks and strategic people not to get into what's going
[2:58:17.020 --> 2:58:23.300]  on here but I mean I think you know for the last five days we under Chinese hack attack
[2:58:23.300 --> 2:58:26.660]  and I have a lot of trouble holding things back from the audience but then when I talk
[2:58:26.660 --> 2:58:31.620]  about it the enemy uses it it becomes an issue but you've seen how they've been deplatforming
[2:58:31.620 --> 2:58:35.540]  people not just off the internet but how they've been deplatforming people out of banking and
[2:58:35.540 --> 2:58:39.980]  credit cards so I'm spending a good five hours a day jacking around with that and like I'm
[2:58:39.980 --> 2:58:44.740]  kind of a whack-a-mole but let me just say it's it's it's ten times the attacks we ever
[2:58:44.740 --> 2:58:50.660]  dealt with before and it kind of a sick level I'm like well they just shut me down I gotta
[2:58:50.660 --> 2:58:53.900]  lay everybody off but I can at least take a break but I don't want to take a break but
[2:58:53.900 --> 2:58:59.180]  part of me does like God Almighty break all I'm getting at here is this is really in-game
[2:58:59.180 --> 2:59:09.140]  stuff happening and you know Trump's basically bankrupt because of this they've attacked all
[2:59:09.140 --> 2:59:12.900]  his companies all his things and that's fine we're not victims we don't approach things
[2:59:12.900 --> 2:59:19.740]  as victims but as champions and leaders in this fight but I mean it's it's not been fun
[2:59:19.740 --> 2:59:24.380]  and so I've already mortgaged my house I've already done it all to make sure we have it
[2:59:24.380 --> 2:59:28.700]  just a month operating capital outs of what we got I had pressed on everything I've done
[2:59:28.700 --> 2:59:34.460]  I have I have funded 50 plus organizations over the years covertly with no strings of
[2:59:34.460 --> 2:59:37.740]  taxes I thought they were good people many cases they were some cases they weren't I'm
[2:59:37.740 --> 2:59:43.500]  just saying you cannot bet in the crap game of life or the roulette wheel of life on a
[2:59:43.500 --> 2:59:48.700]  number like 1776 that info wars metaphysically represents so I want to thank you all for
[2:59:48.700 --> 2:59:54.460]  your prayers your word of mouth is just as important but I just I'd be a liar if I didn't
[2:59:54.460 --> 2:59:58.700]  tell you that if we were like a battleship where we got fire shooting up the side and
[2:59:58.700 --> 3:00:03.500]  you know cannonballs you know exploding in the only yards which is fine I always expected
[3:00:03.500 --> 3:00:10.980]  this but 52 days out the deep state their whole system I mean you know what happened
[3:00:10.980 --> 3:00:16.020]  to like Romans where they'd take somebody's kid hostage and stuff like that I mean let
[3:00:16.020 --> 3:00:20.820]  me just explain something to you it someday I'll be able to tell you all the stuff that's
[3:00:20.820 --> 3:00:25.940]  going on and I don't feel sorry for myself I just want you to know it's it to me I'm
[3:00:25.940 --> 3:00:31.300]  a gauge like a canary in the coal mine and so attacks before like you know 50% they're
[3:00:31.300 --> 3:00:36.980]  at 100% right now that you know the thermometer might break at the top you know Dr. Nick Beggars
[3:00:36.980 --> 3:00:40.940]  he's not a victim he's an overcomer they killed his dad for giving Native Americans and and
[3:00:40.940 --> 3:00:45.460]  citizens of Alaska part of their own land so I mean a lot of people paid for what we've
[3:00:45.460 --> 3:00:50.340]  got and I'm ready to pay right now I'm actually I'm even worried about it I'm worried about
[3:00:50.340 --> 3:00:54.540]  myself and God and the rest of eternity and you know like like Beggars always says people
[3:00:54.540 --> 3:00:58.300]  would give everything for that last five minutes alive till you're gone it doesn't matter anymore
[3:00:58.300 --> 3:01:03.740]  you've got eternity and now time is worthless so I already get that zen understanding but
[3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:09.420]  I'm just telling you I need to tell you as a as a gauge in a in a dashboard that that
[3:01:09.420 --> 3:01:14.700]  that this is the big one folks this is the big enchilada the way we break these balls
[3:01:14.700 --> 3:01:20.460]  right now at the beginning of this pool game is going to affect the whole next level and
[3:01:20.460 --> 3:01:24.940]  so your word of mouth your prayer your financial support I would engage in it now because it
[3:01:24.940 --> 3:01:29.540]  could be your last chance to get an M4 t-shirt it'd be your last chance to support us into
[3:01:29.540 --> 3:01:33.940]  the future because I'm somebody that you know has been very close to destruction a lot of
[3:01:33.940 --> 3:01:38.420]  times but we've never been this close and so I do need to go ahead and just tell you
[3:01:38.420 --> 3:01:43.740]  that you know we're we're under attack we're we're SOS we're we're on fire in more ways
[3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:48.340]  than one spiritually we're on fire we're also on fire under enemy attack because we are
[3:01:48.340 --> 3:01:53.900]  in the fight so that's my transmission I want to thank you all we'll have live coverage
[3:01:53.900 --> 3:01:57.420]  tomorrow the next Trump boat rally and I'll be back Sunday Lord willing with a Sunday
[3:01:57.420 --> 3:02:01.740]  show four to six p.m. we now have Sunday live with our destroyer as well that are Nick Beggars
[3:02:01.740 --> 3:02:09.100]  a scientist researcher best-selling author great patriot takes over so thank you don't
[3:02:09.100 --> 3:02:13.740]  think that's Alex and I want to pick up right where where you left off you know because
[3:02:13.740 --> 3:02:19.780]  I think back how long we've been working together and then about two and a half years ago for
[3:02:19.780 --> 3:02:25.540]  the first time we actually met in person I flew down to us it was amazing hung up yeah
[3:02:25.540 --> 3:02:32.060]  yeah and I spent a week with everybody and got to meet your team and who's there and
[3:02:32.060 --> 3:02:37.900]  you know and and just before then and since then every Friday I volunteer my time so
[3:02:37.900 --> 3:02:43.860]  you know what what Alex is saying right now I can tell you is is the absolute truth and
[3:02:43.860 --> 3:02:48.940]  I remember that day it did that night at dinner we're having dinner and we're talking and
[3:02:48.940 --> 3:02:55.780]  Alex is always running a hundred and ten percent and at one point in dinner he goes hey break
[3:02:55.780 --> 3:03:00.820]  out the camera we're gonna film this you know and I said Alex out the lack you know because
[3:03:00.820 --> 3:03:06.820]  you're always worked and this is what the audience and people listening need to understand
[3:03:06.820 --> 3:03:13.940]  it's not like oh the days over the light switches off it never ran it it never ends he's doing
[3:03:13.940 --> 3:03:19.780]  like a hundred and ten percent and then what happens you know you're always running that
[3:03:19.780 --> 3:03:23.780]  speed and at some point you need a little bit of a break and you never and you never
[3:03:23.780 --> 3:03:27.860]  get I know exactly what you're saying and at the end of the dinner I remember we were
[3:03:27.860 --> 3:03:32.620]  walking out of the restaurant I put my hand in the center of your chest I said Alex you
[3:03:32.620 --> 3:03:37.460]  don't need to run a hundred and ten percent you need to run ninety so you've got ten percent
[3:03:37.460 --> 3:03:44.060]  reserved to yourself so you can have that reserve you know and dish it out to your family and
[3:03:44.060 --> 3:03:49.380]  your close friends and reserve that for you and it's like you're tithing to your own temple
[3:03:49.380 --> 3:03:54.580]  you know if you think about it that way and you add about ten years on to your life on
[3:03:54.580 --> 3:03:59.740]  the other end you know you live longer because you're less stressed but the audience right
[3:03:59.740 --> 3:04:06.380]  now needs to support the info wars and and do something affirmative that is material
[3:04:06.380 --> 3:04:12.900]  because that's the way that's the green gasoline that keeps the thing going and the way it's
[3:04:12.900 --> 3:04:19.220]  done is the 360 and that's where everybody wins so support the info wars go to the info
[3:04:19.220 --> 3:04:26.380]  war store get something there that means something to you and can help you and your family and
[3:04:26.380 --> 3:04:31.940]  do that today so when it makes a difference to the info wars today and I volunteer every
[3:04:31.940 --> 3:04:36.980]  Friday I take my morning out and I get ready for the program and I do that and I do that
[3:04:36.980 --> 3:04:42.220]  because two and a half years ago I said Alex I don't want all the noise you know the transaction
[3:04:42.220 --> 3:04:46.740]  noise of selling books and selling products I just want to give content I want to give
[3:04:46.740 --> 3:04:51.260]  something once a week and would you please allow me to do that and we've worked this
[3:04:51.260 --> 3:04:55.660]  out where I get to do that and yeah I still have some books and some videos but they're
[3:04:55.660 --> 3:05:01.260]  only sold to the info wars store that's it the only place you can get them unless you're
[3:05:01.260 --> 3:05:06.140]  here and because I want to support this network what it stands for what it's done for a quarter
[3:05:06.140 --> 3:05:11.260]  of a century it's been about the info wars for goodness sake that's all it's ever been
[3:05:11.260 --> 3:05:19.060]  about and it's if you don't think it's about that now you've not been paying attention
[3:05:19.060 --> 3:05:25.580]  to anything anybody's been saying for at least 25 years plus I've been doing this quarter
[3:05:25.580 --> 3:05:32.980]  of a century Alex been doing this and the team that's on board in Austin your team
[3:05:32.980 --> 3:05:38.900]  is incredible everybody there what they do and the stress levels that happen up and down
[3:05:38.900 --> 3:05:44.180]  you know is as you're trying to get the story out and you're trying to get the information
[3:05:44.180 --> 3:05:51.180]  and so do something affirmative last last week I talked about what you can do you know
[3:05:51.180 --> 3:05:56.940]  and kind of a script that can be followed do something in favor of yourself your family
[3:05:56.940 --> 3:06:04.700]  your friends extend to the info wars family to and make something happen and that's how
[3:06:04.700 --> 3:06:09.220]  we do it we do it together whether we're all that tip of that fear and we're all making
[3:06:09.220 --> 3:06:15.820]  a difference in everything that we do no matter how big or how small we think it is and I've
[3:06:15.820 --> 3:06:21.820]  said it often do what you know you can do that's the step of faith in life whether it's
[3:06:21.820 --> 3:06:26.740]  supporting this network or something else do something in favor of your own future in
[3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:31.700]  the future of those you haven't even met yet the unborn those that haven't even arrived
[3:06:31.700 --> 3:06:39.940]  yet do something for them this is dr. nick baggage will be right back ignorance does
[3:06:39.940 --> 3:06:47.500]  not equal bliss ignorance equals slavery if you're ignorant walking through a field at
[3:06:47.500 --> 3:06:52.260]  night that there's a six foot hole up ahead you're gonna step in it and probably break
[3:06:52.260 --> 3:06:57.820]  your ankle or maybe worse well it's the same thing happening to human civilization the
[3:06:57.820 --> 3:07:02.420]  industrialized age really empowered humanity in many respects but also took us away from
[3:07:02.420 --> 3:07:07.220]  the land made us very very domesticated and very very easy to manipulate and now corruption
[3:07:07.220 --> 3:07:11.780]  and predatory activity can hide behind that complexity now I know what's going on behind
[3:07:11.780 --> 3:07:16.620]  the complexity because I go read what the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation the Davos
[3:07:16.620 --> 3:07:22.260]  group and the Goldberg group and all their subsidiaries what the club of Rome say so
[3:07:22.260 --> 3:07:28.140]  I know exactly what's going on not because I'm even that cool or special a person but
[3:07:28.140 --> 3:07:33.220]  I'm actually want to be empowered and informed because I'm a history buff I know that those
[3:07:33.220 --> 3:07:36.380]  that don't know history don't repeat it the globalists think you're stupid they laugh
[3:07:36.380 --> 3:07:38.820]  at you because you won't research their own admissions
[3:07:38.820 --> 3:07:43.460]  this is gonna come down to fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't
[3:07:43.460 --> 3:07:47.100]  they're going to contest the election they're going to say Trump lost they're super pissed
[3:07:47.100 --> 3:07:51.020]  that I'm on air I want them shut down I want them silence I want them muted I think they
[3:07:51.020 --> 3:07:55.660]  are horrible for our society you kept us on air we did the analysis first it's now gone
[3:07:55.660 --> 3:08:00.900]  mainstream we continue to be the epicenter and what they said directly to us is you continue
[3:08:00.900 --> 3:08:05.580]  to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want and you need to stop right
[3:08:05.580 --> 3:08:08.980]  now and they're very very serious well I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil worshipping
[3:08:08.980 --> 3:08:13.140]  chopper lessons it's not going to happen so they are moving now to destroy I used to say
[3:08:13.140 --> 3:08:18.500]  support it for us rescue it for us save yourself save the world we're in this together because
[3:08:18.500 --> 3:08:22.740]  let me tell you something communism's up here info wars is the damn blocking it which is
[3:08:22.740 --> 3:08:27.380]  all of us together supporting and you and I are all down here with our families my children
[3:08:27.380 --> 3:08:32.940]  are right here but I need money to fight a war and I need word of mouth and I need prayer
[3:08:32.940 --> 3:08:38.580]  and I need action because that damn's going to come down crops told you hell's coming
[3:08:38.580 --> 3:08:55.220]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:55.220 --> 3:09:09.980]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host nick baggage
[3:09:09.980 --> 3:09:15.540]  and welcome back and it's good to be here this friday afternoon in most parts of the
[3:09:15.540 --> 3:09:21.180]  country still a little bit more noon here in anchorage Alaska you know I'm thinking about
[3:09:21.180 --> 3:09:26.660]  just everything that's going on and I know it's the anniversary of 9 11 and people have
[3:09:26.660 --> 3:09:33.220]  been talking about that already today and I'm not going to go there at the moment except
[3:09:33.220 --> 3:09:40.180]  to say that you know big opportunities are buried in bad news you know no matter what
[3:09:40.180 --> 3:09:46.260]  the heck it is and now when you got think about this what did 9 11 roll out force it
[3:09:46.260 --> 3:09:52.020]  rolled out the endless war you know like we dropped back a few centuries into these thirty
[3:09:52.020 --> 3:09:59.260]  year hundred year wars you know alex was a history buff my dad was a history teacher
[3:09:59.260 --> 3:10:06.460]  as a beginning point you know in history is really defines a lot in fact I was I was
[3:10:06.460 --> 3:10:13.100]  talking about this book it's it's the new american history by woodard and w e woodard
[3:10:13.100 --> 3:10:18.060]  and this book I ordered another topic because they're kind of hard to find because they
[3:10:18.060 --> 3:10:25.300]  printed the last ones in 1939 excuse me 37 and so they're a little difficult to find
[3:10:25.300 --> 3:10:32.340]  but it's worth reading and because it was pre-war war two you know after war one pre-war
[3:10:32.340 --> 3:10:38.300]  war two the guy who wrote it interesting he wrote he finished it just before 1936 and
[3:10:38.300 --> 3:10:44.940]  so his perspective was really a different one that's before the internet you know that's
[3:10:44.940 --> 3:10:50.700]  before most people had telephones that's before TV that's before where people listen to the
[3:10:50.700 --> 3:10:55.820]  radio you know that was you know radio was it you know that was a big entertainment and
[3:10:55.820 --> 3:11:01.580]  so when you think about history he used to read you know read books that you can't change
[3:11:01.580 --> 3:11:06.460]  after the fact like you can't have story on the internet right Wikipedia you can pull
[3:11:06.460 --> 3:11:12.740]  it out push it in dance it around make make it up who cares right I mean that's history
[3:11:12.740 --> 3:11:18.940]  today obsolete book get yourself some those are really not especially history history
[3:11:18.940 --> 3:11:26.540]  is never obsolete in fact the perspective of a writer closer to the time might actually
[3:11:26.540 --> 3:11:32.460]  be more useful if you can interpret it in the context in which it was written you know
[3:11:32.460 --> 3:11:38.180]  that's why you know being a bit of a scholar you know you think about things differently
[3:11:38.180 --> 3:11:43.420]  and I got you know I suffered through a bunch of things you know and Alex is built a big
[3:11:43.420 --> 3:11:49.180]  organization with a lot of risk and he's suffering through some things from time to time you
[3:11:49.180 --> 3:11:53.580]  know at one point in my public work I lost everything I had a bankrupt start over that's
[3:11:53.580 --> 3:11:59.340]  2002 most people didn't know it you know because I started this work way before that and I
[3:11:59.340 --> 3:12:05.460]  just kept on going you know I I sort of hit a big speed bump and so what did I do I set
[3:12:05.460 --> 3:12:11.700]  up another way to make my living while I was doing my public work and I never stopped and
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:16.900]  and then I got blessed by some good things happening in my life and I make a good living
[3:12:16.900 --> 3:12:22.500]  so I can give a lot of time and I do and because that's the most valuable thing you ever have
[3:12:22.500 --> 3:12:29.380]  anyway and that gets into my subject for the day because wealth and nonprofits and people
[3:12:29.380 --> 3:12:35.700]  like Gates and the big guys you know what what's in it for them right and this is important
[3:12:35.700 --> 3:12:40.140]  perspective I've known a lot of very wealthy people billionaires in fact I've known a bunch
[3:12:40.140 --> 3:12:45.340]  of very powerful political people I've met presidents and vice presidents and congressmen
[3:12:45.340 --> 3:12:50.300]  and senators and scads of people in power big business leaders that own big chunks of
[3:12:50.300 --> 3:12:56.580]  the economy I've met a lot of people in my life because of the nature of what I've done
[3:12:56.580 --> 3:13:02.020]  in my life and and so and then I read all the time my fiance will tell you I read like
[3:13:02.020 --> 3:13:08.580]  eight nine hours a day that's what I do that's my profession actually is to do that condense
[3:13:08.580 --> 3:13:13.020]  information and pass it on to you and then I make my living with my left foot is one
[3:13:13.020 --> 3:13:18.740]  of my buddies used to say I and I'm very blessed in that because I get to do this and here's
[3:13:18.740 --> 3:13:24.980]  what I learned about wealth wealth is about doing what you love doing you know and so
[3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:30.260]  you want to interpret people interpret what motivates them you know and here's what motivates
[3:13:30.260 --> 3:13:36.820]  me is motivating you that's it you know because I never organized the thing you know I don't
[3:13:36.820 --> 3:13:42.780]  have a big team I don't have a team I have you and and the people that work in info wars
[3:13:42.780 --> 3:13:49.060]  and the other networks that I work with that is my I always set it up that way why because
[3:13:49.060 --> 3:13:56.420]  I wanted to develop content and still reserve something so that I could keep being creative
[3:13:56.420 --> 3:14:03.700]  because this is what a lot of us miss is it's the creative things we do with our most valuable
[3:14:03.700 --> 3:14:12.060]  thing we have called time in the physical that is the definition of living the wealth
[3:14:12.060 --> 3:14:19.540]  with a living soul occupying a body is the time slot that you get while you're here
[3:14:19.540 --> 3:14:25.580]  okay so what I've been talking about a lot lately is not wasting your time slot and
[3:14:25.580 --> 3:14:31.460]  not feeling frustrated because you're not running at 110% you don't need to do that
[3:14:31.460 --> 3:14:39.700]  you need to run 90% that's an A right it's an A good reserve 10% to your own temple
[3:14:39.700 --> 3:14:47.740]  your body your body and be respectful of that and then your body and the extension
[3:14:47.740 --> 3:14:55.380]  of it to your spouse all right and your family and your friends your extension in the earth
[3:14:55.380 --> 3:15:03.460]  of this thing that we're engaged in you have it for them and for you and that's okay it
[3:15:03.460 --> 3:15:10.020]  really is and here's the deal then you're then you're optimized then you're balanced and optimized
[3:15:10.020 --> 3:15:15.180]  that's part of the deal and you can go and weather the storm because you're the middle
[3:15:15.180 --> 3:15:21.220]  of the storm you're the quiet part of the storm you're the eye of the storm this is
[3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:30.300]  the power of it this is the wisdom in it and you are it each of us in this game that we're
[3:15:30.300 --> 3:15:37.180]  doing together to change the reality of the world now the other team knows this too but
[3:15:37.180 --> 3:15:41.980]  they function through big organizations that they can then manipulate infiltrate screw
[3:15:41.980 --> 3:15:48.100]  with whatever I've always said from the very first day I started this I would do it in
[3:15:48.100 --> 3:15:54.300]  a different way a group of one a committee of one and I would energize a bunch of committees
[3:15:54.300 --> 3:16:03.700]  of one that's you me everybody else because at some level we're connected but if we begin
[3:16:03.700 --> 3:16:10.940]  to act you know out of out of something that pushes us you know that we're passionate about
[3:16:10.940 --> 3:16:18.220]  within our living experience we'll create very differently and if we do it in the in
[3:16:18.220 --> 3:16:30.500]  us in a spirit of reverence you know of divinity even of recognition even of the truth even
[3:16:30.500 --> 3:16:36.620]  of what we say we are and behaving that way is really the message in it and the experience
[3:16:36.620 --> 3:16:42.300]  of it is how we project in the world now here's the big guys at the top the Bill Gates want
[3:16:42.300 --> 3:16:46.940]  to accumulate wealth and I talked about wealth enough in other segments to define it but I'll
[3:16:46.940 --> 3:16:50.700]  get into that a little bit before we get out of this because I want to talk about the big
[3:16:50.700 --> 3:16:57.980]  guys and what motivates them as it relates to you and me so that we can then recognize
[3:16:57.980 --> 3:17:08.660]  the power they recognize only if we can recognize it as a mass of millions guess what we win
[3:17:08.660 --> 3:17:14.900]  we win so the message in today's program is grabbing our power back stopping the looting
[3:17:14.900 --> 3:17:22.740]  of the world and showing pulling the pants down on the new world order okay because it's
[3:17:22.740 --> 3:17:29.860]  time to wake up and smell the roses and change the game this is dr. Nick baggots you're listening
[3:17:29.860 --> 3:17:45.620]  to info wars and check us out info wars dot com big tech is the global straitjacket of
[3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:47.540]  the new world order it is the enforcement system the surveillance system it's gonna track everything
[3:17:47.540 --> 3:17:52.420]  you do everywhere you go everything you say everything you basically think and then reward
[3:17:52.420 --> 3:17:58.340]  or punish you for those behaviors and they're not liberals that's a complete and total cover
[3:17:58.340 --> 3:18:03.700]  they are monsters that love authoritarianism and are building towards a post-human world
[3:18:03.700 --> 3:18:09.540]  their mission is to destroy indigenous communities annihilate small towns annihilate all human
[3:18:09.540 --> 3:18:16.020]  culture and consolidate us all isolate us all and then carry out our orderly extermination this is
[3:18:16.020 --> 3:18:22.820]  their public master plan the covet nineteen is the cover for the rollout of this digital
[3:18:22.820 --> 3:18:27.620]  control system ladies and gentlemen it's only going to get worse from here when you see officials
[3:18:27.620 --> 3:18:32.900]  from apple google facebook twitter you are looking at people way more smart and way more evil than
[3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:39.540]  hitler they want to murder you and your family you have been warned i don't want to be right about
[3:18:39.540 --> 3:18:48.420]  this prediction in fact it's it's not a prediction it is a forecast if we continue down the economic
[3:18:48.420 --> 3:18:53.460]  road we're on globally with the ongoing covet nineteen lockdowns and the structure of productivity
[3:18:53.460 --> 3:18:58.580]  it will continue to accelerate these ripple effects that are breaking down supply chains that will
[3:18:58.580 --> 3:19:03.220]  starve tens of millions of additional people in the third world and destroy decades of human
[3:19:03.220 --> 3:19:08.900]  infrastructure that's been built it will annihilate the funding of that and put the entire first
[3:19:08.900 --> 3:19:15.300]  world in even deeper debt which were being maneuvered into so i really think the smart move
[3:19:15.300 --> 3:19:20.340]  is to end all these lockdowns immediately and prosecute the people that launched the giant
[3:19:20.340 --> 3:19:26.900]  covet scam giant covet con game there's really just a big power grab but in case we can't reverse
[3:19:26.900 --> 3:19:31.220]  all this we better start digging in and get horrible food and getting prepared to be self-sufficient
[3:19:31.220 --> 3:19:35.380]  because that's the name of their game is to make us dependent on them so get self-sufficient now
[3:19:35.380 --> 3:19:40.820]  in full wars dot com i talk about all the horrible things that are happening and i point out that
[3:19:40.820 --> 3:19:46.020]  the globalist are eugenics death cult because it's true i don't say it to scare you a lot of people
[3:19:46.020 --> 3:19:50.820]  say man this show is dark well you've got to know you're dealing with evil if you're going to defeat
[3:19:50.820 --> 3:19:56.820]  it and if we just listen to the surface of what the nwo propagandists are saying they have reasons
[3:19:56.820 --> 3:20:02.260]  to sell this garbage to the general public but if you just scratch the surface they're so arrogant
[3:20:02.260 --> 3:20:07.780]  they've all written to tell blueprints of this plan and more and more being honest about it
[3:20:08.340 --> 3:20:14.260]  because there comes a point where as david eich says they have to stop hiding it and start selling
[3:20:14.260 --> 3:20:20.500]  it so we're at the point of the emergence now and it's coming out in the open and some people
[3:20:21.620 --> 3:20:26.020]  under mass dot com syndrome are going to submit to any level of care in it but others are going to
[3:20:26.020 --> 3:20:32.100]  fight this isn't like some old dictatorship that you could submit to it and join it be okay
[3:20:32.100 --> 3:20:36.580]  no this thing is post-human and exterminism research what that is
[3:20:36.580 --> 3:20:42.580]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:42.580 --> 3:21:05.380]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind with nick baggage
[3:21:05.380 --> 3:21:20.420]  what a friday you know here we are 9 11 2020 and uh man i was thinking about during the break a
[3:21:20.420 --> 3:21:27.300]  couple things kind of four few pieces of the segments together i got a email this week
[3:21:27.300 --> 3:21:32.580]  from a 16 year old and uh self-parallel maybe he's listening even and he asked me three questions and
[3:21:32.580 --> 3:21:39.300]  i want to i want to uh ask and answer myself those questions and what first when he asked me was
[3:21:39.300 --> 3:21:44.020]  in the state of affairs you know should i go to college you know i've been thinking about
[3:21:44.020 --> 3:21:50.180]  being a doctor or a lawyer or and i and i want to go into politics someday and i'm thinking wow and
[3:21:50.180 --> 3:21:55.140]  he says and i listen to you on info wards and i'm thinking i'm getting asked a 16 year old
[3:21:55.140 --> 3:22:01.300]  asking me these questions he's listening and he's asking me should i go to college should i invest
[3:22:01.300 --> 3:22:08.660]  in that is the world going to fall apart you know and man that's uh you know pretty heavy duty question
[3:22:08.660 --> 3:22:14.900]  you know and what what what do you say and so i want to say it to everybody i want to say you
[3:22:14.900 --> 3:22:20.100]  have to know what's happening in the world but you don't suspend what you're doing like what's
[3:22:20.100 --> 3:22:27.540]  going on with this covet 19 thing right now you have to move forward um it because you don't know
[3:22:27.540 --> 3:22:32.820]  the hour and you don't know the day and you know and and i've lived long enough to see enough
[3:22:33.540 --> 3:22:40.340]  the end of the world scenarios to know that hey maybe it is maybe it isn't but behave responsibly
[3:22:40.340 --> 3:22:46.980]  not in some panic party so plan your life like you would and do it prudently like you should
[3:22:47.540 --> 3:22:52.500]  don't get into a big student debt because you'll never escape it if things do fall apart so be
[3:22:52.500 --> 3:22:58.180]  mindful be sensible approach it maybe a little differently don't rack up a big debt and think
[3:22:58.180 --> 3:23:03.460]  about what you're going to get educated in and how you're going to get your education and and where
[3:23:03.460 --> 3:23:10.180]  do you want to get it and i would advise something else those 16 year old or anyone else get a trade
[3:23:10.180 --> 3:23:18.740]  you know truck driving bang and nails carpentry electrician and a profession engineer business degree
[3:23:18.740 --> 3:23:25.540]  whatever get them both i've done things with my hands and my head my whole life alaskans kind of
[3:23:25.540 --> 3:23:31.700]  do this anyway if you live up here very long or lived out of the cities at all and so you do you
[3:23:31.700 --> 3:23:37.220]  do both and then you're a more equipped human being you know something that we lose sight of
[3:23:37.220 --> 3:23:44.660]  and everyone's specialized point now where you can't even think about making it i can't i can't
[3:23:44.660 --> 3:23:49.300]  because i've learned and i've gained skills and i've collected enough books for what i don't know
[3:23:49.300 --> 3:23:54.020]  and you see a little glimmer of it behind me and read about 10 000 and i'm not suggesting you got to
[3:23:54.020 --> 3:23:59.860]  read 10 000 books but be very selective you know make sure you got the right material on the shelf
[3:23:59.860 --> 3:24:04.820]  you know you don't know how to survive you better get some good books to tell you how and practice a
[3:24:04.820 --> 3:24:11.060]  few things you know but the point of the matter is the world has always been this way there's nothing
[3:24:11.060 --> 3:24:16.100]  new it's just not happened lately at home it's happening everywhere else somewhere else right
[3:24:16.100 --> 3:24:21.300]  now if you travel a lot like i do around the world you see a lot of suffering in the world
[3:24:21.940 --> 3:24:27.620]  and you and you thank god every day when you see it up close and personal what a difference it makes
[3:24:27.620 --> 3:24:32.900]  to live in the united states because the next question he asked me was what country would you
[3:24:32.900 --> 3:24:37.780]  go to if the liberals take over and this thing gets even worse you know where would you go
[3:24:37.780 --> 3:24:49.220]  oh wow you know um having traveled all over the world um i'm here okay i'm here i'm in the united
[3:24:49.220 --> 3:24:57.780]  states uh wow you know uh do i like parts of the rest of the world yeah there's a lot of places i've
[3:24:57.780 --> 3:25:05.860]  been i've been to 50 countries a lot of several times and um a lot of my like to visit um i like
[3:25:05.860 --> 3:25:12.660]  i wouldn't mind living for a period of time in a lot of places but uh no i i think i i would stay here
[3:25:13.780 --> 3:25:18.020]  even if it gets really nasty and bad because the other parts of the world are really worse
[3:25:18.020 --> 3:25:24.980]  and this one we might be able to hold and and get back and that's uh kind of where i'm at then the
[3:25:24.980 --> 3:25:29.300]  third question he asked me is okay if if you if you believe in the united states and this is the
[3:25:29.300 --> 3:25:35.300]  only place we're staying because he was thinking ahead he said what state would you go to and now
[3:25:35.300 --> 3:25:40.580]  there's an interesting question you know maybe the short list is which ones would you avoid you know
[3:25:40.580 --> 3:25:46.820]  and can you look around you know i know oregon okay is rioting and you hear about portland but a lot
[3:25:46.820 --> 3:25:52.660]  of parts of oregon are very different they're much conservative areas of oregon i know i've been there
[3:25:52.660 --> 3:25:57.860]  i've driven all through oregon driven you know with an automobile you know as i've seen all the
[3:25:57.860 --> 3:26:04.500]  united states by automobile not by jet plane uh you know and by jet plane too of course
[3:26:04.500 --> 3:26:12.740]  but the point i'm making is on the ground on the ground it's cities clusters of places where the
[3:26:12.740 --> 3:26:19.380]  craziness is going on in steroids now in certain parts of the country it spreads out pretty broadly
[3:26:19.380 --> 3:26:25.540]  and and i don't like what i see uh and it's a national rollout this is what also it's a global
[3:26:25.540 --> 3:26:32.020]  rollout really when i see it internationally it plays out with a little shape it with a little
[3:26:32.020 --> 3:26:38.740]  cultural massage you know a little a little window dressing to make the picture look prettier than it
[3:26:38.740 --> 3:26:48.260]  actually is or you can say a map to hide behind you know a way to obscure the view a bit get you
[3:26:48.260 --> 3:26:53.780]  to look over there when you ought to be looking over here but you know thinking about this wealth
[3:26:53.780 --> 3:27:01.380]  i was going to talk a little bit about this um so what state would i go to you can evaluate
[3:27:01.380 --> 3:27:08.900]  where you're at you can determine where you want to be um i like where i am i live in alaska i hate
[3:27:08.900 --> 3:27:14.500]  the winners i gotta tell you i mean a lot of them you know it thinks you want and being born here but
[3:27:15.300 --> 3:27:21.860]  the winners are hard as heck man i mean it's cold and it's dark and the darkness is something
[3:27:21.860 --> 3:27:27.300]  that's hard to get used to no matter what you know and and it's a metaphor right i mean we go from
[3:27:27.300 --> 3:27:32.660]  darkness to light darkness to light that's the cycle of alaska because we have the midnight sun
[3:27:32.660 --> 3:27:40.180]  in the summer and the darkness in the winter and uh it's a metaphor for who we all are right i mean
[3:27:40.180 --> 3:27:46.580]  we come out of our own darkness into our light here we cycle through it every year and uh and and
[3:27:46.580 --> 3:27:52.660]  here's what happens okay as people build and i talked about wealth and what it is and as people
[3:27:52.660 --> 3:27:59.620]  build wealth it gets to a point where hey what do you need what do you want physically materially
[3:27:59.620 --> 3:28:04.740]  and and there's a point where you actually have it you know i live in a what would be considered
[3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:10.260]  a middle class maybe even a little lighter middle class because i don't need any more than than that
[3:28:12.260 --> 3:28:19.140]  but it also makes my life a lot simpler you see because it operates really efficiently and allows
[3:28:19.140 --> 3:28:27.540]  me time i get to keep my time and spend it see i spend my time as a priority and i about budget
[3:28:27.540 --> 3:28:33.940]  my time as a priority and that's what we each get to do and then we get to program it in now when you
[3:28:33.940 --> 3:28:40.980]  get to retirement age and you have a fixed income well hey then you you kind of get this rebirth i've
[3:28:40.980 --> 3:28:47.060]  witnessed it with a lot of retirees because now you got time because you you're you're you're green
[3:28:47.060 --> 3:28:53.460]  gasoline is fuel in your budget so there's this people with wisdom know this it's the retirees
[3:28:53.460 --> 3:28:58.900]  that have the power of time so you want to create political movements retirees or your answer you
[3:28:58.900 --> 3:29:03.620]  know it's look for look for the blue haired ladies is what someone told me once and they're
[3:29:03.620 --> 3:29:10.740]  absolutely correct because it's about people who are committed to doing that make a difference
[3:29:10.740 --> 3:29:15.780]  and when you get your time back you get to do more now think about that from a bill gates perspective
[3:29:15.780 --> 3:29:22.900]  here's a dude that's got like all the money under the sun so that money isn't so valuable anymore
[3:29:22.900 --> 3:29:29.380]  but doing stuff with it is okay because that's his how he creates whatever he thinks he ought to be
[3:29:29.380 --> 3:29:37.860]  creating but he does it tax free okay he does it tax exempt he does it by screwing you and then
[3:29:37.860 --> 3:29:47.460]  bse okay this is what so many nonprofits do that you fail and we fail to see because we think about
[3:29:47.460 --> 3:29:54.260]  their public purpose but what we don't think about is their public influence and i want to talk about
[3:29:54.260 --> 3:30:01.380]  that because it's about the power of influence that creates outcomes when big nonprofits get big
[3:30:01.380 --> 3:30:08.420]  money and can influence things a certain way and there's only a certain way they can in a certain
[3:30:08.420 --> 3:30:13.620]  way they can and i want to talk about the rules of nonprofits and why they work against you and
[3:30:13.620 --> 3:30:21.220]  how they can work for you but how the big guys use it to screw you and me over with their good
[3:30:21.220 --> 3:30:29.460]  works as a pave the road to hell with gold and that's the story for today for the last
[3:30:29.460 --> 3:30:32.580]  segment going into the last like this is dr. Nick baggage we'll be right back
[3:30:36.820 --> 3:30:41.700]  well mark zuckerberg on paper two weeks ago put in hundreds of millions of dollars with
[3:30:41.700 --> 3:30:47.540]  bloomberg to launch this operation red mirage to contest the election when it's overwhelmingly
[3:30:47.540 --> 3:30:53.220]  clear that trump has won on election night now he's come out the statement and told all the media
[3:30:53.220 --> 3:30:58.020]  in the united states that they better get behind saying that trump basically lost that they're not
[3:30:58.020 --> 3:31:03.220]  going to let trump declare victory even though it's overwhelming they'll have 95 percent of the vote
[3:31:03.220 --> 3:31:07.700]  don't election night and even if you added all the other votes in against him he'd be the winner
[3:31:07.700 --> 3:31:11.780]  they are going to steal this election they're preparing everyone you've seen all the scams
[3:31:11.780 --> 3:31:17.380]  they've already run trump is surrounded by tyrants but he has we the people and he has
[3:31:17.380 --> 3:31:22.820]  true media not independent media the real media so now more than ever it's critical to share the
[3:31:22.820 --> 3:31:27.780]  live streams the videos the articles and the information info wars dot com because the globalists
[3:31:27.780 --> 3:31:33.700]  fear at most things we were the first to expose their plan to contest the election and drag it out
[3:31:33.700 --> 3:31:38.820]  to keep the american people from re-electing president trump the clock is ticking on the once
[3:31:38.820 --> 3:31:45.700]  free world and the free press is under attack more than ever i now see videos 10 or 15 times
[3:31:45.700 --> 3:31:50.980]  a day without even trying to find them of press being arrested the united states press being
[3:31:50.980 --> 3:31:56.740]  arrested canada the uk europe australia new zealand and it's always the so-called liberal left the
[3:31:56.740 --> 3:32:02.660]  defenders of speech doing it they are the authoritarians they work for the chai con globalist
[3:32:02.660 --> 3:32:10.020]  combine and they are working around the clock to silence info wars just as we were the group they
[3:32:10.020 --> 3:32:14.980]  started with three years ago they test out everything new on us and a lot of it i can't get
[3:32:14.980 --> 3:32:19.620]  into on air at this point i'll be able to reveal this later but i just want to make you all realize
[3:32:19.620 --> 3:32:26.020]  that your support your word of mouth your prayer is absolutely essential and i thank you all for it

[3:33:34.260 --> 3:33:43.540]  the info war the trick that social engineers use is very very simple they just teaches that the
[3:33:43.540 --> 3:33:51.220]  architecture of civilization that the trajectory of the species is designed by these ever-knowing
[3:33:51.220 --> 3:33:56.580]  loving liberal technocrats and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride everything will be great
[3:33:56.580 --> 3:34:01.620]  but then they tell us that humans are obsolete not essential and we're bad for the earth and we
[3:34:01.620 --> 3:34:08.100]  need to be phased out so they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being
[3:34:08.100 --> 3:34:15.460]  very passive living in the matrix like system that they're building but what defines humans more
[3:34:15.460 --> 3:34:20.980]  than anything from the rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment we
[3:34:20.980 --> 3:34:26.660]  build our own environments we create our own systems we really geoengineer and terraform the
[3:34:26.660 --> 3:34:32.980]  planet and its systems towards our aims but instead we're acting like animals and the globalists
[3:34:32.980 --> 3:34:43.540]  by the part of humans and us as cattle that's the trick you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:43.540 --> 3:35:04.500]  you're listening to the alex jones show with nick baggage
[3:35:04.500 --> 3:35:15.860]  and welcome welcome back you know i'm thinking about this again you know people ask me all the
[3:35:15.860 --> 3:35:21.460]  time how can you be so you're always smiling you know how can you have that attitude when
[3:35:22.100 --> 3:35:28.180]  when you know all this stuff is going on in the world and and you know really it's a lot of things
[3:35:28.180 --> 3:35:32.580]  i i mean i can't really explain it in one segment i'm not going to even attempt to today but
[3:35:32.580 --> 3:35:39.860]  but i can tell you it's it's a lifetime of doing and experiencing and learning from those experiences
[3:35:39.860 --> 3:35:46.340]  both the hard way and sometimes fortunately by the grace of god a little easier ways
[3:35:48.180 --> 3:35:54.180]  but but what i what i what i've really come to is uh is i get to do what i love doing you know
[3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:59.860]  and and that's where i am in my life and i get to do this every friday talk to a few million people
[3:35:59.860 --> 3:36:05.460]  and pass on what i've learned in the week or what's occurred to me at the moment and and it comes
[3:36:05.460 --> 3:36:11.860]  out pretty well usually you know when i think about um that what motivates people we were talking
[3:36:11.860 --> 3:36:18.740]  about that in the last segment and on the big scale here's how it goes your once you got a level
[3:36:18.740 --> 3:36:27.140]  at once you've achieved a level of success monetarily that's kind of like uh what are you
[3:36:27.140 --> 3:36:33.860]  doing you know and you don't do it just to grab more piles of fiat you know some people do but
[3:36:33.860 --> 3:36:41.140]  they're chasing a rainbow in a fiction to begin with most people don't uh who acquire a big wealth
[3:36:41.140 --> 3:36:47.220]  what they have is a vision of what they want to do and they go after that vision and then
[3:36:47.220 --> 3:36:53.060]  they figure out how what they get pulled into you know they build a plan around it i know alex
[3:36:53.060 --> 3:36:58.500]  built his vision that way i built mine that way and everybody i know that ever built a vision built
[3:36:58.500 --> 3:37:04.740]  it that way you did too every one of us did whatever that vision for our life is we construct it
[3:37:04.740 --> 3:37:09.140]  and that's what that 16 year old was really asking me and i say have a vision for your life and go
[3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:14.900]  construct it go create it in fact i'd say be the doctor and the lawyer and the politician do them
[3:37:14.900 --> 3:37:20.020]  all why should you do just one life could go a long time you know you might get time to do them
[3:37:20.020 --> 3:37:27.460]  all do them all be curious be inquisitive um stretch your limits figure out what you're about
[3:37:28.020 --> 3:37:32.020]  go internal every once in a while and make sure you're doing it right you know test yourself a
[3:37:32.020 --> 3:37:39.860]  little bit but these guys once they achieve and you two a certain level and don't make it so high
[3:37:39.860 --> 3:37:48.100]  that you're just a consumer a grabber a spender a consumer do it so you're a producer that you're
[3:37:48.100 --> 3:37:53.380]  creating something see those were those four things i was mentioning you know in several segments
[3:37:53.380 --> 3:38:00.660]  entrepreneurship which is creative talent applied to business right and labor your time your time
[3:38:00.660 --> 3:38:08.260]  you know your back provided into labor and then uh capital equipment whether it's a shovel a squeegee
[3:38:08.260 --> 3:38:15.620]  or a factory making stuff things that make things that's capital or uh natural resources and land
[3:38:15.620 --> 3:38:22.500]  the real stuff you know that builds real well this is once you have a baseline of of subsistence
[3:38:22.500 --> 3:38:27.620]  whatever that represents in your life in alaska we can talk about subsistence in the bush that
[3:38:27.620 --> 3:38:32.980]  means something different but it means really the same thing it's about enjoying a way of living
[3:38:33.620 --> 3:38:40.900]  that is sufficient for you uh and and then after that it's all about creation and how you use your
[3:38:40.900 --> 3:38:46.100]  time whether it's to spend it with your grandkids or your family or however you decide to do it you
[3:38:46.100 --> 3:38:52.660]  get to do it you get to do all of it all along the way and the beauty of it is at the end of the day
[3:38:53.300 --> 3:39:00.420]  whatever you create it's your responsibility good or bad so choose as well as you can and if you've
[3:39:00.420 --> 3:39:07.460]  done it what you think you put the label bad on it dust off do what you can do and try again
[3:39:07.460 --> 3:39:12.660]  that's the name of the game but when you get to the point of being retired so you're one of those
[3:39:12.660 --> 3:39:18.500]  blue-haired men or ladies these days and you get to go do stuff do something you know because now
[3:39:18.500 --> 3:39:24.660]  you're empowered with freedom that's you know freedom think about this and this was going to
[3:39:24.660 --> 3:39:30.260]  be my theme today was slavery and what the slavery we're in and when does freedom begin and for a
[3:39:30.260 --> 3:39:38.820]  lot of people freedom begins at 65 or 67 or 70 and think about it by then if you stayed healthy
[3:39:39.620 --> 3:39:48.260]  and you've done it at a 90 ratio instead of 110 you probably got 20 more to go you know and 20 more
[3:39:48.260 --> 3:39:53.220]  without having to worry about necessarily waking up in the morning and paying the rent because
[3:39:53.220 --> 3:39:57.620]  you take care of things now sometimes a lot of everyone's in that position but a lot of people
[3:39:57.620 --> 3:40:04.820]  are and so you get to apply your talent your time your energy your knowledge and do it one at a time
[3:40:04.820 --> 3:40:09.460]  that's how things change in the world one at a time you talk to people you engage people but you
[3:40:09.460 --> 3:40:16.740]  do it with a spirit of divinity of kindness of graciousness of the truth of trying to inform
[3:40:16.740 --> 3:40:21.380]  not debate and anger raise people's anger and you know we do that too because sometimes that's
[3:40:21.380 --> 3:40:29.300]  the way it works and a lot of folks have talked to me and helped me figure out some things about
[3:40:29.300 --> 3:40:36.180]  how we approach change and you can do it in all different ways at all different volumes okay and
[3:40:36.180 --> 3:40:43.220]  that's okay because everybody responds differently to different approaches to information and I think
[3:40:43.220 --> 3:40:55.060]  that's the important thing
[3:40:55.060 --> 3:41:06.900]  so
[3:41:11.620 --> 3:41:17.220]  president trump is taking fire from all sides as he continues to reassure the country that he won't
[3:41:17.220 --> 3:41:23.860]  stop fighting we are returning power to you the american people with your help your devotion and
[3:41:23.860 --> 3:41:30.180]  your drive we are going to keep on working we are going to keep on fighting and we are going
[3:41:30.180 --> 3:41:37.460]  to keep on winning winning winning the attacks didn't stop trump from being nominated for the
[3:41:37.460 --> 3:41:43.860]  nobel peace prize which trump earned unlike president obama meanwhile joe biden's faction
[3:41:43.860 --> 3:41:50.500]  of power hungry new world order goons is war gaming how to take power even if trump is reelected as
[3:41:50.500 --> 3:41:57.940]  jamie white reports a far left coalition war gamed several post election apocalyptic scenarios
[3:41:57.940 --> 3:42:03.620]  in case democrat candidate joe biden lost to president trump predicting that info wars would
[3:42:03.620 --> 3:42:10.500]  get involved by doxing joe biden electors and linking 88 of these electors to george soros and
[3:42:10.500 --> 3:42:17.860]  14 to child sex trafficking in a bizarre piece by the daily beast entitled the left secretly preps
[3:42:17.860 --> 3:42:23.300]  for mega violence after election day a group called the fight back table analyzed different
[3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:29.540]  election scenarios that draw from the transition integrity projects white paper outlining different
[3:42:29.540 --> 3:42:35.300]  election scenarios that included several blue states acceding from america and bringing violence
[3:42:35.300 --> 3:42:41.220]  to the streets should trump win it's an organization that emerged at the end of last year that pretends
[3:42:41.220 --> 3:42:47.780]  to be a bipartisan group interested in making sure the election is free and fair but it's
[3:42:47.780 --> 3:42:54.020]  run by george soros and the open society institute and it's partnered with a group linked with the
[3:42:54.020 --> 3:42:59.940]  chinese communist party the begruin institute one source familiar with the democracy defense
[3:42:59.940 --> 3:43:05.860]  nerve center operation said some of the hurdles were straightforward how you occupy hold space
[3:43:05.860 --> 3:43:10.340]  and shut things down not just on election day but for weeks there's some people expect that
[3:43:10.340 --> 3:43:14.740]  there to be an answer to who won the election on election night i don't think we're necessarily
[3:43:14.740 --> 3:43:20.260]  going to get that and i think it's important that we start preparing people now that there's
[3:43:20.260 --> 3:43:24.740]  nothing illegitimate about taking a few extra days or even weeks in order to make sure that
[3:43:24.740 --> 3:43:28.820]  all the votes get counted in fact it would be illegitimate if we if we didn't make sure that
[3:43:28.820 --> 3:43:33.780]  all of the ballot votes were counted i think that this is important because there is unfortunately
[3:43:33.780 --> 3:43:43.140]  i think a heightened risk of um of civil unrest in the period you know between uh between voting
[3:43:43.140 --> 3:43:48.980]  and a result being called or or or after that and i just think that we need to be doing everything
[3:43:48.980 --> 3:43:54.660]  that we can to reduce the chances of violence or civil unrest in the wake of this election if
[3:43:54.660 --> 3:44:02.100]  that were to happen would facebook be blamed in part um well i like others are more complicated
[3:44:02.100 --> 3:44:08.980]  like what quick transportation options can be in place should poll locations mysteriously close
[3:44:08.980 --> 3:44:15.140]  while others have been simply impossible to plan out the daily beast continued but hardball tactics
[3:44:15.140 --> 3:44:20.260]  would bring more aggressive responses from the right the beast reported the simulation for a
[3:44:20.260 --> 3:44:26.740]  narrow biden win saw a scenario in which info wars published a list of addresses phone numbers and
[3:44:26.740 --> 3:44:32.180]  other personal information of electors pledged to vote for joe biden of course info wars wouldn't
[3:44:32.180 --> 3:44:38.100]  publish anything without having evidence to support it and why would exposing child trafficking
[3:44:38.100 --> 3:44:45.940]  be a bad thing you are secretly saving the world from this cytanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals
[3:44:45.940 --> 3:44:53.220]  does that sound like something you are behind well i haven't i haven't heard that but uh
[3:44:54.180 --> 3:44:59.700]  is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing i mean you know if uh if i can help save the world
[3:44:59.700 --> 3:45:05.620]  from problems i'm willing to do it i'm willing to put myself out there all of this as professional
[3:45:05.620 --> 3:45:11.540]  sleazeball michael cohen who is on house arrest due to tax evasion and campaign violations attempts
[3:45:11.540 --> 3:45:17.300]  to tarnish the president's image i described mr trump as a cult leader and i was in this cult
[3:45:17.300 --> 3:45:23.540]  and i well while i was in the cult i was really refusing to acknowledge that the actions that i
[3:45:23.540 --> 3:45:36.340]  was performing for my boss
