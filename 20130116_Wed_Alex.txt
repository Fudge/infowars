[00:00.000 --> 00:11.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.720 --> 00:12.720]  he.
[00:12.720 --> 00:16.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt the normal intro to the broadcast to bring
[00:16.840 --> 00:24.720]  you the would-be dictator-in-chief, shamelessly exploiting children, looking like a bad guy
[00:24.720 --> 00:31.980]  of a dystopic movie, Barack Obama up there with the other thug, gangster Joe Biden, just
[00:31.980 --> 00:36.000]  getting ready with 23 executive actions.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.160]  And yes, they're now leaking, and he's about to announce it. They're gonna go after gun
[00:40.160 --> 00:44.480]  owners. They're gonna try to ban our ammo. They're gonna try to make you register. They're
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.160]  gonna try to make you come turn your guns in. They are gonna release hell on us and
[00:49.160 --> 00:55.160]  try to get a bunch of bans passed in Congress on top of it. So it's on.
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.920]  First they take your guns, then they take your property, then they take your children,
[00:59.920 --> 01:04.040]  then they put you in a forced labor camp, then they take your life. And they are collapsing
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.840]  America. You see the militarization of police. Dressing like Darth Vader, you see the 1.6
[01:08.840 --> 01:13.680]  million bullets. We are going into a total collapse and they wanna get our guns beforehand,
[01:13.680 --> 01:16.120]  or at least say all gun owners are terrorists.
[01:16.120 --> 01:20.560]  This is the way they're gonna designate conservatives and libertarians the enemy. This is the plan.
[01:20.560 --> 01:26.520]  We've got to impeach now. I take you to the scumbag in chief, the fraud, the New World
[01:26.520 --> 01:31.120]  Order minion that's gutting this country and raising taxes on poor people to mercilessly
[01:31.120 --> 01:32.120]  bankrupt them.
[01:32.120 --> 01:37.960]  They've got laws passed, so companies cut people's hours from 40 to 29. Just the man
[01:37.960 --> 01:44.480]  who wants you bankrupt, Mr. agenda 21, himself using dead children. The sickening vampire,
[01:44.480 --> 01:51.200]  the psychic vampire pig, Barack Hussein Obama with his other thug, Biden. Here it is.
[01:51.200 --> 01:57.680]  One thing we can do to reduce this violence. If there's even one life that can be saved.
[01:57.680 --> 01:58.960]  We've got to please Biden this.
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.720]  Then we've got an obligation to try. Really, all the Prozac the kids are on? Number one
[02:04.720 --> 02:09.920]  cause of death, now suicide, cuz you people putting 60 million people on psychotropics.
[02:09.920 --> 02:15.320]  At that desk and I will sign a directive giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals
[02:15.320 --> 02:20.600]  and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence.
[02:20.600 --> 02:22.720]  The Federal Thought Police, it's the New York bill.
[02:22.720 --> 02:25.040]  It will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.
[02:25.040 --> 02:26.040]  The New York bill.
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.480]  By strengthening the background check system.
[02:27.480 --> 02:29.640]  Oh really, this guy tried to get a gun five times.
[02:29.640 --> 02:31.520]  We will help schools hire more resource officers.
[02:31.520 --> 02:32.520]  And couldn't.
[02:32.520 --> 02:33.520]  If they want them.
[02:33.520 --> 02:37.660]  Resource officers to spy on the kids, not to protect them.
[02:37.660 --> 02:41.400]  We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of
[02:41.400 --> 02:42.400]  violence.
[02:42.400 --> 02:43.400]  That's right.
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.160]  Then the more more psychiatrists in the schools are more likely kids on psychotropics than
[02:48.160 --> 02:50.160]  the perpetrator.
[02:50.160 --> 02:51.380]  They're gonna stage more shootings.
[02:51.380 --> 02:52.380]  They're behind it.
[02:52.380 --> 02:53.380]  You can just see.
[02:53.380 --> 02:54.380]  Year after year.
[02:54.380 --> 02:59.560]  Those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical
[02:59.560 --> 03:00.560]  research.
[03:00.560 --> 03:03.000]  This guy has always said he wants to take all our guns.
[03:03.000 --> 03:04.560]  They want all the guns.
[03:04.560 --> 03:06.720]  It isn't reasonable what you want, you liar.
[03:06.720 --> 03:08.560]  There's ways to reduce it.
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.960]  And Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young
[03:12.960 --> 03:13.960]  minds.
[03:13.960 --> 03:14.960]  They'll never stop them.
[03:14.960 --> 03:16.440]  We don't benefit from ignorance.
[03:16.440 --> 03:25.800]  We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence.
[03:25.800 --> 03:26.800]  You know the science.
[03:26.800 --> 03:29.720]  You know they were developed for murder fantasizing.
[03:29.720 --> 03:33.200]  These are a few of the 23 executive actions that I'm announcing today.
[03:33.200 --> 03:35.200]  But as important as these steps are.
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.760]  You know they're murder simulators.
[03:36.760 --> 03:39.840]  They are in no way a substitute for action for members of Congress.
[03:39.840 --> 03:43.020]  You know they were given to the military so they'd kill up close.
[03:43.020 --> 03:45.520]  To make a real and lasting difference.
[03:45.520 --> 03:48.280]  Get the Prozac heads off the Prozac.
[03:48.280 --> 03:49.280]  And Congress must act.
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.460]  Stop pushing murder suicide pills.
[03:51.460 --> 03:52.460]  You new world order scumbag.
[03:52.460 --> 03:54.460]  I'm calling on Congress to pass some very specific proposals-
[03:54.460 --> 03:55.740]  Take the floor out of the water.
[03:55.740 --> 03:56.740]  Stop giving kids blue shots.
[03:56.740 --> 03:59.040]  It's killing them.
[03:59.040 --> 04:00.040]  Stop killing kids with drones all over the world.
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.320]  First, it's time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.320]  to buy a gun.
[04:05.320 --> 04:06.320]  That means transferring it to your family.
[04:06.320 --> 04:07.320]  That's right.
[04:07.320 --> 04:08.320]  General control.
[04:08.320 --> 04:09.320]  Shutting down.
[04:09.320 --> 04:13.280]  And they're going to say guns are retroactively illegal.
[04:13.280 --> 04:15.280]  That you legally bought.
[04:15.280 --> 04:16.280]  Look at that parade in those little kids.
[04:16.280 --> 04:18.640]  They're already required as licensed gun dealers to run background checks.
[04:18.640 --> 04:23.120]  And over the last 14 years that's kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their
[04:23.120 --> 04:25.700]  hands on a gun.
[04:25.700 --> 04:31.880]  But it's hard to enforce that law when as many as 40% of all gun purchases are conducted
[04:31.880 --> 04:32.880]  without a background check.
[04:32.880 --> 04:33.880]  Yeah, they're going to start raiding people.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.880]  They've already announced this.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.880]  That's not safe.
[04:35.880 --> 04:38.440]  And saying your guns are illegal and saying where'd you get them?
[04:38.440 --> 04:41.680]  It's not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers.
[04:41.680 --> 04:43.800]  And he's going to talk about expanding the size of the ATF.
[04:43.800 --> 04:47.880]  If you want to buy a gun, whether it's from a licensed dealer or a private seller, you
[04:47.880 --> 04:50.800]  should at least have to show you are not a felon.
[04:50.800 --> 04:51.800]  We're going to break here.
[04:51.800 --> 04:53.800]  We'll come back with more of the aftermath.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.080]  This is common sense.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.640]  You notice I'm wearing camo.
[04:56.640 --> 04:57.840]  I'm part of the citizen militia.
[04:57.840 --> 05:02.260]  I have a right to own guns.
[05:02.260 --> 05:08.560]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.200]  Ben Soap Company.

[06:59.960 --> 07:04.940]  Looking back on 2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[07:04.940 --> 07:09.520]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[07:09.520 --> 07:11.400]  by a disastrous economy.
[07:11.400 --> 07:14.100]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[07:14.100 --> 07:18.280]  At eFoods Direct we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's
[07:18.280 --> 07:20.560]  storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[07:20.560 --> 07:25.360]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores
[07:25.360 --> 07:30.160]  are closed but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[07:30.160 --> 07:31.160]  and niece.
[07:31.160 --> 07:34.960]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[07:34.960 --> 07:37.200]  I can warn you but I can't feed you.

[08:00.880 --> 08:10.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:10.280 --> 08:14.400]  The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[08:14.400 --> 08:20.440]  It is the 16th day of January, 2013.
[08:20.440 --> 08:26.020]  We have been watching and taking notes, it's exactly what we thought, 23 devastating attacks
[08:26.020 --> 08:30.360]  with executive actions and executive orders on the Second Amendment.
[08:30.360 --> 08:35.420]  Doctors are going to spy on people and report to the CPS.
[08:35.420 --> 08:39.800]  If you own guns in the home, even though they're not illegal, they are to harass gun owners.
[08:39.800 --> 08:42.320]  They are to swat team gun owners' homes.
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.160]  If you sell a gun to any friends or family, they're gonna claim that's a felony.
[08:46.160 --> 08:49.840]  They're gonna try to make you retroactively prove the providence of your guns.
[08:49.840 --> 08:52.200]  They are going to try to put taxes on ammo.
[08:52.200 --> 08:56.120]  They're gonna massively expand the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms so they can
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.320]  ship more guns into Mexico to kill more people in false flags so they can blame the Second
[09:00.320 --> 09:01.440]  Amendment.
[09:01.440 --> 09:06.520]  He's rattling this all off while pimping out poor little children that he's exploiting
[09:06.520 --> 09:10.920]  up there on the stage, knowing the federal government made the schools gun-free zones.
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.480]  And then the media hyped, hey, an option for crazies on Prozac or other drugs who play
[09:15.480 --> 09:18.280]  shoot-em-up games all day, go to the school and kill people.
[09:18.280 --> 09:24.840]  And they're trying to put, collectively, the guilt of dead kids on us for our Second Amendment.
[09:24.840 --> 09:28.040]  Because they want us to live like folks do in Chicago and New York with the highest crime
[09:28.040 --> 09:30.000]  rates in the world.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.320]  Because the victims have been disarmed with thug cops everywhere, feeding on people along
[09:34.320 --> 09:35.800]  with thugs in the streets.
[09:35.800 --> 09:40.000]  Meanwhile, good cops all over the US in cities and towns saying, we're not gonna enforce
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.080]  this, guns make us safer.
[09:42.080 --> 09:45.720]  They want us to be like they are in other areas like Chicago and LA, where everybody
[09:45.720 --> 09:46.720]  lives in fear.
[09:46.720 --> 09:50.400]  And they're like in Oakland, big shoot-em-ups every night.
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.320]  Because they're a mafia, let's go back to this thug exploiting these children.
[09:54.320 --> 09:56.560]  When he swore to never go after our guns, here it is.
[09:56.560 --> 10:02.000]  The only way we can change is if the American people demand it.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.000]  He wants to rally everybody.
[10:03.000 --> 10:07.880]  And by the way, that doesn't just mean from certain parts of the country.
[10:07.880 --> 10:09.800]  They're organizing on a jihad after our guns.
[10:09.800 --> 10:14.800]  We're gonna need voices in those areas, in those congressional districts where the tradition
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.200]  of gun ownership is strong.
[10:16.200 --> 10:17.200]  The fight is on folks.
[10:17.200 --> 10:18.200]  To speak up.
[10:18.200 --> 10:19.200]  If they can take the guns, they can take everything.
[10:19.200 --> 10:21.000]  They're gonna take the pension funds.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.440]  It can't just be the usual suspects.
[10:22.440 --> 10:23.760]  They're gonna totally bankrupt us.
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.960]  That's why they're militarizing the police, armored vehicles, billions of bullets.
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.960]  We have to examine ourselves and our hearts.
[10:28.960 --> 10:29.960]  Yeah, examine your hearts.
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.960]  We have to examine ourselves.
[10:30.960 --> 10:33.480]  Just cuz you got a peace prize and you're supposedly half black, doesn't mean you get
[10:33.480 --> 10:34.480]  to be a dictator.
[10:34.480 --> 10:35.480]  This will not happen unless the American people demand it.
[10:35.480 --> 10:37.160]  All the stupid trendies think it's so cute.
[10:37.160 --> 10:38.160]  Yeah, and you know what?
[10:38.160 --> 10:42.200]  They put themselves in the moral high ground position knowing there's gonna be more mass
[10:42.200 --> 10:43.200]  shootings.
[10:43.200 --> 10:46.840]  And if they have to, they'll stage them.
[10:46.840 --> 10:47.840]  Like Larry Pratt said.
[10:47.840 --> 10:50.840]  Responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say, enough.
[10:50.840 --> 10:53.680]  If they'd staged fast and furious, they'd stage this.
[10:53.680 --> 10:54.800]  They'd stage Aurora.
[10:54.800 --> 10:59.720]  Too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue, then change
[10:59.720 --> 11:00.720]  will come.
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.840]  Look at Biden.
[11:04.840 --> 11:08.640]  That's what it's gonna take.
[11:08.640 --> 11:17.080]  On the letter that Julia wrote me, she said, I know that laws have to be passed by Congress,
[11:17.080 --> 11:24.160]  but I beg you to try very hard.
[11:24.160 --> 11:25.840]  Julia I will try very hard.
[11:25.840 --> 11:27.400]  Folks, this is so sick.
[11:27.400 --> 11:29.760]  He's now looking at the little children.
[11:29.760 --> 11:33.240]  Now the children are gonna tell us turn our guns in.
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.640]  The government- They need to bring these proposals up for a vote.
[11:36.640 --> 11:38.640]  Goes and says the kids say do this.
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.400]  Make sure that they do.
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.560]  Unbelievable the president rallying to overturn the Second Amendment and using five and six
[11:45.560 --> 11:46.560]  year old children.
[11:46.560 --> 11:48.560]  No background checks to keep guns out of the wrong place.
[11:48.560 --> 11:49.560]  Fade that down.
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.080]  Ask them if they- That's killing private transfer, giving guns as gifts, which they know.
[11:54.080 --> 11:57.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this government shipped guns into Mexico to cause carnage.
[11:57.920 --> 12:01.400]  The CBS News got the memos to blame the Second Amendment.
[12:01.400 --> 12:05.080]  They killed thousands over there, hundreds over here, including five police officers,
[12:05.080 --> 12:07.800]  three of them border patrol, conservatively.
[12:07.800 --> 12:09.200]  They are so cold blooded.
[12:09.200 --> 12:13.580]  And these sweet little kids up there he's using, again, this is what Al Gore said a
[12:13.580 --> 12:14.580]  few years ago.
[12:14.580 --> 12:18.320]  He went to public schools and said, you heard the audio, you tell your parents pay carbon
[12:18.320 --> 12:19.320]  taxes.
[12:19.320 --> 12:21.160]  You tell them, you know best.
[12:21.160 --> 12:25.800]  Every authoritarian society goes to the kids and says, you tell your parents what to do.
[12:25.800 --> 12:27.720]  This is outrageous.
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.480]  And so they handpicked kids' letters that have been mailed in, Million Mom March kids
[12:32.480 --> 12:33.480]  and other people.
[12:33.480 --> 12:37.680]  And then they sit there and display them and go, I'm gonna get the guns for you, little
[12:37.680 --> 12:38.680]  kid.
[12:38.680 --> 12:41.080]  And now you're against the little kids if you don't take the guns.
[12:41.080 --> 12:42.800]  I mean, this is so transparent.
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.800]  This is a guy that lied to everybody and said, I will not raise taxes unless you make a quarter
[12:47.800 --> 12:48.800]  million a year.
[12:48.800 --> 12:52.240]  And he raised it on people making 30,000 a year.
[12:52.240 --> 12:57.000]  And even lower in some actuaries, Obama phone lady got her latest paycheck.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.180]  And they took even more out.
[12:59.180 --> 13:01.860]  Everybody in my office gets more taken out now.
[13:01.860 --> 13:03.800]  And that's just the beginning.
[13:03.800 --> 13:05.480]  It's all these lies.
[13:05.480 --> 13:09.680]  It's like being informed is like torturous.
[13:09.680 --> 13:10.680]  Let's go back.
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.680]  Let's go back right now back to the would be dictator who again is saying Congress needs
[13:14.680 --> 13:15.680]  to do this.
[13:15.680 --> 13:16.680]  But I do have-
[13:16.680 --> 13:17.680]  The right to worship freely and safely.
[13:17.680 --> 13:23.040]  That right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.
[13:23.040 --> 13:26.560]  The right to assemble peaceably.
[13:26.560 --> 13:27.560]  That right was denied-
[13:27.560 --> 13:31.640]  Now he's saying the Second Amendment is attacking all our other rights.
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.760]  No, the drug war has created a thug culture.
[13:35.760 --> 13:38.600]  The giant prisons are colleges of crime.
[13:38.600 --> 13:41.240]  And we've got guns that are holding your crime wave back.
[13:41.240 --> 13:42.240]  Fading down.
[13:42.240 --> 13:43.240]  That were denied.
[13:43.240 --> 13:48.240]  We are holding your crime wave back and you hate the fact that crime using guns in the
[13:48.240 --> 13:51.920]  last 16, 17 years has dropped 49%.
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.820]  And that overall violent crimes dropped 21% fbi.gov.
[13:55.820 --> 13:58.160]  Real local numbers compiled and filed.
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.200]  You hate that concealed carry is pushing back your urban crime wave.
[14:02.200 --> 14:06.760]  You hate the fact that people in big cities illegally have guns to protect themselves.
[14:06.760 --> 14:07.980]  You hate it.
[14:07.980 --> 14:12.800]  You want total control to do to us whatever you want, you gangster thug.
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.560]  And that's why I've written a citizen's move.
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.000]  And people ask me, well, how are you saying citizens, like citizen arrest?
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.280]  I filed articles of impeachment publicly at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com that I wrote
[14:28.280 --> 14:32.240]  last night in consultation with Paul Watson and Aaron Dykes.
[14:32.240 --> 14:35.800]  Where I lay out where congressmen and others have shown we're in the Constitution.
[14:35.800 --> 14:40.000]  Obama is done impeachable offenses clearly on their face.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.040]  Saying the UN runs our military and Congress isn't over war now.
[14:43.040 --> 14:46.480]  Saying he can shut down coal power plants without a law, telling Congress to fly a kite.
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.480]  Saying he can launch Libya and Syria attacks and telling Congress to go to hell.
[14:50.480 --> 14:54.120]  Saying he's gonna have orders to restrict guns outside of law.
[14:54.120 --> 14:56.660]  Running fast and furious, caught lying about that.
[14:56.660 --> 15:00.200]  It's all listed there and that's meant now to get that passed around.
[15:00.200 --> 15:03.800]  It's kinda like when a state passes a law and then other states pick up the law.
[15:03.800 --> 15:07.560]  And even if that state doesn't pass it, the law being written may be adopted by others.
[15:07.560 --> 15:13.480]  I've just put out a basic template to everybody and god bless drudgereport.com last night
[15:13.480 --> 15:16.040]  for linking to it and getting it up there.
[15:16.040 --> 15:20.520]  Infowars is getting its record all time, 15 year traffic right now.
[15:20.520 --> 15:23.320]  That Infowars 15 years but on there 17.
[15:23.320 --> 15:28.720]  Record since 1997, record traffic right now and the site is up and down.
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.320]  And I'm trying to hire more IT folks to help the guys I got, they're like Scotty in the
[15:32.320 --> 15:33.320]  engine room.
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.480]  And we're hiring consultants, you name it, but I mean, it's just sustained set of a million
[15:37.480 --> 15:40.200]  visitors between the sites every day that we normally get.
[15:40.200 --> 15:42.360]  It's like two, three million a day.
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.840]  And so we're trying to keep it up, but my citizens petition.
[15:47.840 --> 15:51.520]  Citizen files petition to impeach Obama.
[15:51.520 --> 15:58.680]  Citizen files, in fact, let me give you the exact headline.
[15:58.680 --> 16:01.640]  Here it was up on Drudge Report, it was up there since last night, it may have been taken
[16:01.640 --> 16:02.640]  down.
[16:02.640 --> 16:07.320]  My own headline is on there because my site had gone down.
[16:07.320 --> 16:13.440]  The point is that it's up on infowars.com and it is right there.
[16:13.440 --> 16:16.080]  Citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.
[16:16.080 --> 16:22.080]  We can actually put that up on screen for everybody and it goes through it all.
[16:22.080 --> 16:26.280]  Right there, ladies and gentlemen, the government is massing armaments against us, illegally
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.400]  spying on us, buying billions of bullets, launching drones in the air, training kids
[16:30.400 --> 16:35.440]  to spy on their parents, turning the entire system on its head, going down a list of tyrannical
[16:35.440 --> 16:38.840]  actions and just checking them off.
[16:38.840 --> 16:42.480]  Training the police and military for gun confiscation, in official army manuals.
[16:42.480 --> 16:45.480]  In fact, we need to add that as articles of impeachment.
[16:45.480 --> 16:51.480]  Since 2010, Obama has directed the Secretary of Defense to add this training for domestic
[16:51.480 --> 16:52.480]  operations.
[16:52.480 --> 16:55.280]  Here he is shaking hands with the poor little kids, let's put it back up there.
[16:55.280 --> 17:00.360]  Those poor little victims, take the guns or you don't support these kids, totally disgusting.
[17:00.360 --> 17:01.880]  We've got it all recorded.
[17:01.880 --> 17:05.680]  We're gonna be playing clips of this throughout the broadcast, but citizens file articles
[17:05.680 --> 17:07.760]  of impeachment against Obama.
[17:07.760 --> 17:15.400]  It is up on infowars.com and again, if the site is down for you, you can simply type
[17:15.400 --> 17:21.840]  in citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama and it's signed by Alex Jones.
[17:21.840 --> 17:26.240]  Just like I can go in and swear out an affidavit that I saw my neighbor burying somebody in
[17:26.240 --> 17:34.480]  their backyard, just like I can go swear out an affidavit that I saw my neighbor dumping
[17:34.480 --> 17:36.120]  poison in the well.
[17:36.120 --> 17:39.780]  Just like you can swear out an affidavit that yes, you saw this guy run out of the liquor
[17:39.780 --> 17:41.840]  store with a bag of money in his hand.
[17:41.840 --> 17:45.560]  Well, I've seen treason, I've studied the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and I've
[17:45.560 --> 17:48.840]  gone and seen what the constitutional lawyers are saying and members of Congress.
[17:48.840 --> 17:50.320]  This is all impeachable.
[17:50.320 --> 17:52.560]  He's already done a bunch of impeachable stuff.
[17:52.560 --> 17:55.420]  We're always like, if you do more, we're gonna start impeachment.
[17:55.420 --> 17:58.860]  If you do more, and they tell people in Congress, you want your airplane to blow up?
[17:58.860 --> 18:00.640]  You want your car to run off the road?
[18:00.640 --> 18:01.640]  Because these are gangsters.
[18:01.640 --> 18:02.640]  Well, you know what?
[18:02.640 --> 18:03.640]  I'm here.
[18:03.640 --> 18:04.640]  You know what?
[18:04.640 --> 18:05.640]  They kill me.
[18:05.640 --> 18:06.640]  That's the way it is.
[18:06.640 --> 18:07.640]  I'm like my forebears.
[18:07.640 --> 18:08.640]  I cannot be a slave.
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.480]  I know tyrants when I see it and I am not gonna, let me tell you this.
[18:13.480 --> 18:17.120]  You either leave the country and it's a global government, they're taking over everywhere.
[18:17.120 --> 18:22.060]  The same corporate fraud, the same corporate fascism, using socialism to indenture us,
[18:22.060 --> 18:23.780]  to enslave us, to domesticate us.
[18:23.780 --> 18:28.040]  You either leave the country or you fight back.
[18:28.040 --> 18:30.120]  Because let me tell you something, they are gonna drop the hammer.
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.360]  Folks, they've signed us on to 1,500 trillion.
[18:33.360 --> 18:37.680]  The Chinese government, communists that have, folks type in Bloomberg, I wanna show them
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.060]  a photo of it, suicide nets at Apple factories.
[18:42.060 --> 18:45.660]  The 20 story factories where they drug them and they do forced abortions.
[18:45.660 --> 18:50.120]  So all they do, by the hundreds, we're jumping off to commit suicide.
[18:50.120 --> 18:52.720]  So they put nets there.
[18:52.720 --> 18:57.460]  One person jumps, everybody copycats and goes up to jump because they're there.
[18:57.460 --> 18:58.460]  They're drugged.
[18:58.460 --> 19:00.260]  They're made to work 18 hours a day.
[19:00.260 --> 19:05.720]  They put help me notes in the packages inside Apple's Foxconn factories that Al Gore's on
[19:05.720 --> 19:06.720]  the board.
[19:06.720 --> 19:12.580]  He's the one that demands they have the worst pay in China, slave labor.
[19:12.580 --> 19:14.640]  Suicide nets installed at the dorms, okay?
[19:14.640 --> 19:19.060]  They live in 100 square foot cubicles just like Bloomberg wants to set up.
[19:19.060 --> 19:20.060]  This is a plan.
[19:20.060 --> 19:24.220]  The globalists made a deal with China in the 70s to have the lowest standard in the world
[19:24.220 --> 19:27.120]  to leverage out the United States and to buy our debt.
[19:27.120 --> 19:30.740]  The globalists are clients with the Chinese government against the American people, against
[19:30.740 --> 19:31.740]  their own people.
[19:31.740 --> 19:36.440]  And the Chinese government came out three weeks ago and said, we own your debt, take
[19:36.440 --> 19:37.440]  the guns.
[19:37.440 --> 19:38.900]  That's an order.
[19:38.900 --> 19:41.760]  That is a UN order through the Chinese.
[19:41.760 --> 19:44.440]  I mean, they said, you will take the guns, we own your debt.
[19:44.440 --> 19:45.960]  And Obama is hell-bent to get them.
[19:45.960 --> 19:48.920]  Of course, they sent mercenaries in there to do that.
[19:48.920 --> 19:50.280]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[19:50.280 --> 19:52.280]  Same thing with Colorado, has all the signs.
[19:52.280 --> 19:55.320]  You send in the shooters, have the mental patient saying, I don't know who I am drugged
[19:55.320 --> 19:58.760]  up in the parking lot, or you shoot the drug head in the back of the head and your guys
[19:58.760 --> 20:00.360]  get out.
[20:00.360 --> 20:05.360]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[20:05.360 --> 20:09.940]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[20:09.940 --> 20:11.800]  by a disastrous economy?
[20:11.800 --> 20:14.520]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

[20:18.320 --> 20:21.240]  a life storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[20:21.240 --> 20:25.800]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores
[20:25.800 --> 20:30.600]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[20:30.600 --> 20:31.600]  and niece.
[20:31.600 --> 20:35.400]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[20:35.400 --> 20:37.640]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[22:35.640 --> 22:39.640]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

[24:22.320 --> 24:28.320]  I'm gonna try to settle down here and be as calm as I can about all of this, but you have
[24:28.320 --> 24:31.620]  to understand something.
[24:31.620 --> 24:36.200]  They have passed laws, what, five years ago where they can basically take private pension
[24:36.200 --> 24:37.200]  funds.
[24:37.200 --> 24:39.480]  They haven't started the full move to get them.
[24:39.480 --> 24:40.520]  They've done some tests.
[24:40.520 --> 24:43.360]  They're talking about taking federal pension funds.
[24:43.360 --> 24:46.160]  You notice in Europe this is happening.
[24:46.160 --> 24:50.440]  You notice that they got massive tax increases through, including on the poorest working
[24:50.440 --> 24:57.600]  Americans, 14 different taxes in the last raft of legislation that they rammed through
[24:57.600 --> 24:59.720]  in the fake financial cliff.
[24:59.720 --> 25:02.520]  Now they're back saying, we're in debt again.
[25:02.520 --> 25:07.120]  Bernanke, the real head of this country, the head of the private Federal Reserve said yesterday,
[25:07.120 --> 25:12.060]  let's just get rid of a debt ceiling entirely.
[25:12.060 --> 25:13.960]  They've decided to go Weimar Republic.
[25:13.960 --> 25:17.000]  They've decided to go Zimbabwe.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  And do you know what that means?
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.960]  It means hyperinflation.
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.300]  But stag hyperinflation because you're not gonna have jobs on top of things increasing
[25:26.300 --> 25:27.360]  in price.
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.080]  And you're going to go from 25 million to 50 million on food stamps.
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.280]  We've now crossed that Rubicon to 100 million.
[25:35.280 --> 25:37.580]  And crime is just going to explode.
[25:37.580 --> 25:40.980]  But see, these big city mafia types, they know what they do.
[25:40.980 --> 25:44.720]  They shut things off, get people dependent, ship in the drugs.
[25:44.720 --> 25:45.720]  Government ships in most of the drugs.
[25:45.720 --> 25:51.160]  That's on record congressional hearings, 1997, Solicitor General, the CIA, it's on record.
[25:51.160 --> 25:52.600]  Everybody knows that.
[25:52.600 --> 25:57.560]  They destabilize the society, the working people, the middle class gets scared to say,
[25:57.560 --> 26:02.880]  take whatever rights you want, just keep me safe from the street thugs.
[26:02.880 --> 26:06.080]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[26:06.080 --> 26:13.480]  The problem is, you've had gun ownership in all 50 states go off the chart in the last
[26:13.480 --> 26:15.320]  20 years roughly.
[26:15.320 --> 26:17.880]  Gun ownership has exploded, the gun culture has exploded.
[26:17.880 --> 26:23.560]  And so you've seen a 49%, I did a report on this last week, I'm gonna do another one today
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.560]  or tomorrow with the fbi.gov numbers.
[26:25.560 --> 26:31.920]  Cuz you know, I kept showing violent crime down 21% in the last 15, 16 years, 11 points
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.320]  of that in the last, what, since 2007, last six years roughly.
[26:36.320 --> 26:43.920]  So it's accelerating the drop in overall violent crime, mugging, stabbings, beatings, shootings.
[26:43.920 --> 26:50.440]  And then I was there watching Fox News, and they were at fbi.gov, and they showed crime
[26:50.440 --> 26:56.040]  with guns down a whopping 49%.
[26:56.040 --> 27:01.080]  You go to fbi.gov, I know the media is listening, go look it up, Fox News had it on.
[27:01.080 --> 27:05.600]  I got my iPad, typed it in, went and found it.
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.400]  People were saying to me, Alex, it's higher crime rate drop than what you said.
[27:11.400 --> 27:12.560]  Why are you putting out this info?
[27:12.560 --> 27:17.960]  I was going off one statistic, 49.
[27:17.960 --> 27:23.080]  They cannot stand that, folks, that you're in charge, that you've got a gun, that criminals
[27:23.080 --> 27:25.880]  are scared, that every day there's a new 911 tape in the news.
[27:25.880 --> 27:31.720]  But it's always just local, never national, where the woman's on 911 going, don't come
[27:31.720 --> 27:32.720]  in.
[27:32.720 --> 27:33.720]  Okay, he's busted down the front door.
[27:33.720 --> 27:34.720]  I'm going in the bathroom.
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.500]  911's like, yes, yes, don't engage him, go in the bathroom and hide.
[27:38.500 --> 27:42.000]  He's busting down this door, his arm's coming through a hole, he opened it.
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.840]  I'm gonna shoot him, boom, boom, boom, boom, dead.
[27:45.840 --> 27:49.560]  Or the guy crawls out and dies on the street, or crawls out and is bleeding and the cops
[27:49.560 --> 27:50.680]  come and get him.
[27:50.680 --> 27:52.800]  That's what we're talking about.
[27:52.800 --> 27:59.320]  You see it constantly because of sites like infowars.com and worldnetdaily.com and drudgereport.com
[27:59.320 --> 28:02.360]  that break the establishment media blockade.
[28:02.360 --> 28:15.800]  ABC, NBC, CBS, they will never, ever, ever, ever, ever show you that information, 49?
[28:15.800 --> 28:17.520]  I didn't even know that.
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.400]  I mean, I'd heard the numbers and seen them over the years, a 20 plus percent reduction
[28:22.400 --> 28:26.840]  in violent crime within three years after a concealed carry went in in Florida, same
[28:26.840 --> 28:27.880]  number in Texas.
[28:27.880 --> 28:33.840]  But I guess it's been compounding now over the last decade or more, 49.
[28:33.840 --> 28:37.960]  I was sitting there and I go, that can't be true, 49.
[28:37.960 --> 28:43.120]  That's almost a 50% cut in crimes using guns.
[28:43.120 --> 28:49.720]  And this criminal is up there on TV using kids, and let me tell you, I had him faded
[28:49.720 --> 28:50.720]  down.
[28:50.720 --> 28:51.720]  It's a good thing when it was live.
[28:51.720 --> 28:55.220]  During the break, they were queuing it up back there, we're gonna get it ready for you.
[28:55.220 --> 28:58.480]  Instant high def off the TV, we gotta break it down to play it here on the radio and streaming
[28:58.480 --> 28:59.480]  on the web.
[28:59.480 --> 29:03.000]  Point is, we can't just instantly convert that high def.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.960]  We should set up where we can instantly play high def out here once it's been taped, but
[29:05.960 --> 29:06.960]  whatever.
[29:06.960 --> 29:13.480]  The point is, you saw it, he high fived the kids with a big stinking smile, and Biden
[29:13.480 --> 29:14.720]  could hardly stop smiling.
[29:14.720 --> 29:18.720]  He was trying to have a serious look, and I wanna do a piece on that, alert to the real
[29:18.720 --> 29:19.720]  media out there.
[29:19.720 --> 29:24.340]  Biden, a bunch, was going, especially when he was first introducing Obama, he was trying
[29:24.340 --> 29:25.340]  not to smile.
[29:25.340 --> 29:26.340]  He was going.
[29:26.340 --> 29:29.340]  Yeah, I'm gonna get that gun, baby.
[29:29.340 --> 29:39.440]  Yeah, I'm a gangster, I mean, Biden is a gangster, he is a thug, and so is Obama.
[29:39.440 --> 29:41.280]  They're a bunch of slick thugs.
[29:41.280 --> 29:46.880]  Let me tell you something, your Chicago, New York gangster crap doesn't fly in Texas.
[29:46.880 --> 29:49.680]  You got that, scum?
[29:49.680 --> 29:53.360]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:53.360 --> 29:57.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:03.000 --> 33:05.520]  I was trained in firearms.
[33:05.520 --> 33:07.640]  I carried a concealed weapon.
[33:07.640 --> 33:12.840]  I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going
[33:12.840 --> 33:16.760]  to take them with me.
[33:16.760 --> 33:24.800]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban,
[33:24.800 --> 33:31.800]  picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done
[33:31.800 --> 33:32.800]  it.
[33:32.800 --> 33:37.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[33:37.560 --> 33:43.920]  That's Alex Jones.
[33:43.920 --> 33:54.600]  I'm going to try to settle down here as best I can.
[33:54.600 --> 33:57.200]  I want to open the phones up so you can respond to this.
[33:57.200 --> 34:02.960]  David Knight's got the transcript, one of our reporters in there, of Obama and Biden's
[34:02.960 --> 34:03.960]  speech.
[34:03.960 --> 34:09.720]  There were 23 executive actions and executive orders.
[34:09.720 --> 34:11.280]  They didn't give any particulars.
[34:11.280 --> 34:13.000]  Well, here's the deal.
[34:13.000 --> 34:21.840]  If you go watch the two hour long C-SPAN last week of Rahm Emanuel and others at that socialist
[34:21.840 --> 34:23.480]  think tank.
[34:23.480 --> 34:26.600]  We posted the whole video on Infowars.com a few days ago.
[34:26.600 --> 34:28.240]  They lay out the whole plan.
[34:28.240 --> 34:30.600]  He says we're just gonna let police take the guns.
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.480]  We're gonna just target gun owners and claim they have the guns illegally.
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.480]  We're gonna shut down the gun manufacturers, we're gonna lean on the gun sellers.
[34:38.480 --> 34:42.200]  We're gonna use mafia tactics, that's what he's saying.
[34:42.200 --> 34:46.680]  And again, they're gonna deputize the medical tyranny, the same people that are already
[34:46.680 --> 34:52.920]  giving kids shots without parental consent, to basically call in endangerment orders when
[34:52.920 --> 34:55.440]  they call your kid aside and ask him about guns.
[34:55.440 --> 34:59.880]  They had to pass a law on the healthcare bill that conservatives put in there to where it
[34:59.880 --> 35:01.760]  made it illegal for them to do that.
[35:01.760 --> 35:03.640]  But Obama doesn't care.
[35:03.640 --> 35:07.020]  He says I'm telling doctors you do this.
[35:07.020 --> 35:13.400]  It was doctors that put that guy Lanza and Holmes on all those psychotropic drugs and
[35:13.400 --> 35:17.520]  Harris and Kleibold and the list goes on and on.
[35:17.520 --> 35:19.760]  And nothing was said about drugs in that speech.
[35:19.760 --> 35:20.760]  I've got the transcript.
[35:20.760 --> 35:26.720]  I didn't watch the whole thing cuz I was talking over it, but correct?
[35:26.720 --> 35:31.240]  And I mean, let me have that transcript, I forgot and left it out there, thank you.
[35:31.240 --> 35:32.880]  I mean, that is just amazing.
[35:32.880 --> 35:39.160]  By the way, drudgereport.com, it has all the latest stuff on this, so does infowars.com.
[35:39.160 --> 35:44.320]  The problem is infowars is up and down because of the incredible traffic.
[35:44.320 --> 35:46.080]  Kurt thought it was a denial of service attack.
[35:46.080 --> 35:51.360]  They looked at the traffic, no, it's all time record traffic, which I'm not happy about.
[35:51.360 --> 35:56.200]  If we turn this country around, I would literally have a show about science and a show about
[35:56.200 --> 36:00.400]  literature and movies and about camping and stuff.
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.680]  I would have a once a week, three hour radio, TV show, variety show.
[36:04.680 --> 36:07.600]  I mean, I'd have like magicians on and stuff.
[36:07.600 --> 36:11.640]  I would have a interesting, it'd be like a Johnny Carson show, okay?
[36:11.640 --> 36:19.880]  I don't like having to do this, but I am completely possessed with resistance to tyranny.
[36:19.880 --> 36:21.640]  I am completely animated.
[36:21.640 --> 36:23.000]  I cannot control myself.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.280]  I can hardly sleep because I know we're dealing with criminal tyrants.
[36:28.280 --> 36:34.000]  Drudgereport.com, there it is, citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.
[36:34.000 --> 36:39.620]  And then you go to infowars.com and it is right there.
[36:39.620 --> 36:44.520]  And again, I wrote this, I wrote articles of impeachment a year ago that didn't get
[36:44.520 --> 36:45.520]  any attention.
[36:45.520 --> 36:48.960]  I wrote this with Paul Watson over the telephone last night because he can type better than
[36:48.960 --> 36:49.960]  I can.
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.280]  It would take me five hours if I typed it myself cuz I just make mistakes and go back
[36:54.280 --> 36:56.680]  and use a spell checker.
[36:56.680 --> 37:00.280]  So we wrote this in about two hours together on the phone, but I think I probably need
[37:00.280 --> 37:03.040]  to get Watson on the phone during a break.
[37:03.040 --> 37:08.800]  And just add, so people understand, the original Declaration of Independence started as citizens'
[37:08.800 --> 37:15.400]  petitions called Bill of Particulars in all of the 13 colonies circulated listing the
[37:15.400 --> 37:20.280]  crimes that government was committing against the free rights of an Englishman that they'd
[37:20.280 --> 37:25.960]  fought in 1215 to get and then again with the Parliament Act.
[37:25.960 --> 37:30.700]  Most of the Parliament supported our secession until the King of England basically threatened
[37:30.700 --> 37:32.160]  to arrest a bunch of them.
[37:32.160 --> 37:36.480]  And King George III rode to Parliament and addressed Parliament that was unheard of and
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.560]  said your duty as Englishman is to get in there and take down these rebels.
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.760]  And they again threatened to arrest more people if they didn't get in line.
[37:46.760 --> 37:51.440]  So the king bullied, they would have kept the colonies, we'd still be part of England
[37:51.440 --> 37:55.140]  folks if they, but hey, I'm a British citizen.
[37:55.140 --> 38:00.760]  My ancestors fought for the right for me to have guns and swords and cannons.
[38:00.760 --> 38:06.220]  And I need these to protect myself from the French and the Spanish and the Indians.
[38:06.220 --> 38:07.400]  They were all fighting each other.
[38:07.400 --> 38:08.960]  They were all teaming up together at different times.
[38:08.960 --> 38:11.200]  I mean, it was amazing.
[38:11.200 --> 38:14.280]  There were wars where you'd have 10,000 people get killed.
[38:14.280 --> 38:22.840]  I mean, the westerns all advertise everything that happened from the 1860s on with the Comanche
[38:22.840 --> 38:25.540]  and the Apaches, that was nothing.
[38:25.540 --> 38:34.120]  There were wars with weird rebel settler groups like something out of Conan the Barbarian.
[38:34.120 --> 38:44.720]  And 20,000 Indians with groups of whites and escaped slaves in Andrew Jackson's time and
[38:44.720 --> 38:48.840]  before that would come pouring down out of the Illinois territory.
[38:48.840 --> 38:54.920]  And just huge wars and whole towns and cities burned and tens of thousands dead.
[38:54.920 --> 38:56.560]  No one even knows this history.
[38:56.560 --> 39:00.020]  I mean, it was just Conan the Barbarian.
[39:00.020 --> 39:04.960]  They never make movies out of any of that because that's not what they wanted to popularize
[39:04.960 --> 39:07.160]  because the real history is so incredible.
[39:07.160 --> 39:09.400]  My point is nobody was good in that.
[39:09.400 --> 39:10.540]  Everybody was barbarous.
[39:10.540 --> 39:12.380]  Everybody was making side deals.
[39:12.380 --> 39:16.200]  This Indian tribe coming and saying, English, help me take out these guys with the French
[39:16.200 --> 39:20.200]  and I'll help you divide and conquer the whole nine yards.
[39:20.200 --> 39:25.280]  And the redcoats came and said, we're coming to confiscate your guns.
[39:25.280 --> 39:32.380]  And another thing is the Englishman didn't like the militarized police and the checkpoints
[39:32.380 --> 39:36.420]  and their wives being searched physically.
[39:36.420 --> 39:41.520]  And so they would go and beat up redcoats and redcoats would come and shoot the brigands
[39:41.520 --> 39:42.580]  as they call them.
[39:42.580 --> 39:44.240]  And then the men would go ahead and shoot back.
[39:44.240 --> 39:46.560]  And then the redcoats said, that's it, people are starting to shoot back.
[39:46.560 --> 39:50.220]  We're coming to take your guns, line up and turn them in.
[39:50.220 --> 39:52.240]  And about half the population turned their guns in.
[39:52.240 --> 39:55.320]  But if they were Tories, pro-king, you can keep your gun.
[39:55.320 --> 39:58.960]  In fact, you're now in the king's militia, go and kill whoever you want.
[39:58.960 --> 40:06.620]  And it was the abuses and it was the outrages and it was the king's militias abusing and
[40:06.620 --> 40:12.920]  raping and burning and stealing and shaking people down that turned the colonies against
[40:12.920 --> 40:14.440]  the king and the redcoats.
[40:14.440 --> 40:18.440]  This went on for 15 years roughly.
[40:18.440 --> 40:22.840]  Imagine you're taking apples to town for sale and you come up and there is a government
[40:22.840 --> 40:29.880]  auxiliary SWAT team aiming a cannon at you out of the back of the wagon and they got
[40:29.880 --> 40:32.160]  guns and they say get out.
[40:32.160 --> 40:36.340]  And they come and they steal your apples and they reach into your purse, your wallet and
[40:36.340 --> 40:37.340]  take your money.
[40:37.340 --> 40:40.340]  And you're like, I've got to have that to buy seeds for next year.
[40:40.340 --> 40:42.760]  That's everything I've worked for for a year.
[40:42.760 --> 40:48.260]  And they're just like, stand him up, break his jaw.
[40:48.260 --> 40:52.480]  And if you complained about it, they take your wife and kids and they put them in stocks
[40:52.480 --> 40:53.480]  till they died.
[40:53.480 --> 40:55.820]  A torture apparatus with your head and arms in it.
[40:55.820 --> 41:01.380]  You know how Andrew Jackson, Andrew Jackson, you know how his mother and brother died?
[41:01.380 --> 41:03.160]  In a concentration camp.
[41:03.160 --> 41:09.620]  So he joined the rebellion when he was 11 years old and ran messages and he wouldn't
[41:09.620 --> 41:10.620]  brag about it.
[41:10.620 --> 41:13.680]  So the history is 100% nailed down, but also snipered British soldiers.
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.260]  He's 11, 12, 13, 14 years old, okay?
[41:17.260 --> 41:19.840]  That's where our country came from, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:19.840 --> 41:21.820]  That's what our country was born out of.
[41:21.820 --> 41:27.620]  People's mothers tied up in a concentration camp to die, okay?
[41:27.620 --> 41:30.540]  And that's where every government ends up going.
[41:30.540 --> 41:35.940]  In Russia, in Germany, in China, in Cuba, and in England has had these wars over and
[41:35.940 --> 41:38.340]  over again.
[41:38.340 --> 41:43.060]  The reason the British are so polite is that it goes back to the age of chivalry in the
[41:43.060 --> 41:45.200]  15th, 16th, 17th century.
[41:45.200 --> 41:49.660]  If you were rude to someone, and it all came out of the enlightenment and people becoming
[41:49.660 --> 41:54.780]  free, it was I don't care who you are, you insult me, you be a lord, you be anybody.
[41:54.780 --> 41:57.720]  You're gonna get in a fight with me, I'm gonna call you out.
[41:57.720 --> 42:01.840]  And no one's gonna associate with you ever again if you don't pull your sword or walk
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.500]  your 20 paces and we're gonna fight to the death right now, okay?
[42:06.500 --> 42:11.340]  You just insulted me, you just acted like a tough gang banger, get out in the street,
[42:11.340 --> 42:16.180]  somebody's gonna die right now.
[42:16.180 --> 42:23.780]  An armed society is a polite society, and if you're watching me on TV today, if you're
[42:23.780 --> 42:32.220]  watching the radio streams on TV right now, you notice I'm wearing my camouflage duck
[42:32.220 --> 42:33.220]  hunting jacket.
[42:33.220 --> 42:39.060]  And of course, in a real urban warfare situation, camouflage would be a sports jacket, suit
[42:39.060 --> 42:44.060]  and tie, all right?
[42:44.060 --> 42:49.980]  With a collapsible rifle in the small of my back.
[42:49.980 --> 42:56.620]  I am not an offensive military person, even though I have the basic skills of a rifleman
[42:56.620 --> 43:01.020]  passed on since the founding of this country and before.
[43:01.020 --> 43:06.360]  But the reason I'm wearing camouflage and the new t-shirt that we're selling that by
[43:06.360 --> 43:11.500]  the way has blown away any shirt we've ever sold, it's an AK-47 says come and take it.
[43:11.500 --> 43:14.660]  What my ancestor said at Gonzales, Texas, you come and take it.
[43:14.660 --> 43:18.660]  You wanna take our guns, Santa Ana, you come and take them.
[43:18.660 --> 43:23.380]  That was only 50 years or less after the Revolutionary War.
[43:23.380 --> 43:29.220]  And it says inside the AK-47, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[43:29.220 --> 43:35.780]  Boom, that is the all time bestseller and you support our info war, it's a war bond.
[43:35.780 --> 43:39.420]  It's got infoawars.com on the back, wear your colors proud, meet like minded patriots.
[43:39.420 --> 43:43.920]  And let me tell you, the reason I'm so focused, the reason I'm so angry is also I am risking
[43:43.920 --> 43:50.500]  my life, my treasure, my name to be out front and say, let's have the second American Revolution,
[43:50.500 --> 43:54.420]  have the state secede, pull out, re-upload the republic, which is in the Declaration
[43:54.420 --> 43:55.420]  of Independence.
[43:55.420 --> 43:59.300]  It's not our right, it's our duty to absolve the government and then create a new one.
[43:59.300 --> 44:00.380]  Well, we want our republic back.
[44:00.380 --> 44:05.580]  So you're not real, you're global sympathizers, you're Vici French to the Nazis, get out.
[44:05.580 --> 44:07.300]  We re-upload the republic.
[44:07.300 --> 44:11.640]  And I've had top constitutional lawyers that advise Congress, advise Ron Paul, Harvard
[44:11.640 --> 44:14.280]  lawyers on, they agree with my analysis, okay?
[44:14.280 --> 44:19.660]  Cuz it's not my analysis, it's 1776, it's Declaration of Independence, it's July 4th,
[44:19.660 --> 44:20.740]  it's everything.
[44:20.740 --> 44:32.300]  But I gotta tell you, it's inbred, all these Texans that you see, like Stockton and Toth
[44:32.300 --> 44:37.780]  and all the rest of them, I've gone and looked into these people.
[44:37.780 --> 44:43.900]  They've all been five, six, seven, eight generation Texans, who were the very frontline of the
[44:43.900 --> 44:52.460]  most radical, violent, but smart and aggressive, adventurous Americans in frontier expansion.
[44:52.460 --> 44:56.740]  And some of the most vicious ongoing wars went on here, Indian wars, you name it.
[44:56.740 --> 44:59.980]  And so it's not a macho thing that Texans are saying.
[44:59.980 --> 45:04.060]  And notice it's Texans saying, hey, it isn't happening, it's that it's genetic.
[45:04.060 --> 45:08.340]  I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic, who you are.
[45:08.340 --> 45:13.900]  If you're a Texan and your ancestors go back, you are hot blooded and you're ready because
[45:13.900 --> 45:17.260]  your ancestors were willing to be in the violent frontier.
[45:17.260 --> 45:21.180]  You know Pancho Villa, there was a long civil war in the north of Mexico.
[45:21.180 --> 45:25.700]  The Mexican government tried to take their guns, and what was it, a ten year civil war?
[45:25.700 --> 45:29.700]  Killed hundreds of thousands of people, it's estimated, it was incredible.
[45:29.700 --> 45:32.700]  Because up in the north of Mexico was just as wild as Texas.
[45:32.700 --> 45:36.780]  People are like, you're gonna take my gun when there's wolves and coyotes and bandits
[45:36.780 --> 45:37.780]  and everybody?
[45:37.780 --> 45:38.840]  You're not taking my gun?
[45:38.840 --> 45:42.280]  And the central government said, we are gonna take your guns.
[45:42.280 --> 45:46.060]  There was a civil war in Mexico, a couple of them.
[45:46.060 --> 45:49.960]  You know what, they didn't win, Mexico didn't win against Guatemala and they had guns.
[45:49.960 --> 45:51.440]  That's why Guatemala is Guatemala.
[45:51.440 --> 45:54.980]  The point is everybody wants their guns.
[45:54.980 --> 45:57.900]  Because folks, it's bold that he's going after the guns.
[45:57.900 --> 46:01.320]  When he wants the moral high ground, they're gonna stage something else.
[46:01.320 --> 46:06.940]  White House readies 23 executive actions developing, press doctors to ask patients about guns at
[46:06.940 --> 46:11.220]  home, healthcare providers to offer gun safety tips, counselors in schools.
[46:11.220 --> 46:14.620]  It'll be a big gun demonization thing where kids say bang, bang with their fingers, have
[46:14.620 --> 46:15.660]  a Nerf gun.
[46:15.660 --> 46:22.340]  They shut down whole blocks and arrest the kid, I mean, at least 4.5 billion in new spending
[46:22.340 --> 46:26.780]  to demonize and prosecute and harass gun owners and hold us up like we're child molesters,
[46:26.780 --> 46:29.060]  which is what the Attorney General said they do.
[46:29.060 --> 46:34.300]  Ignores violent movies, video games, pro-gun senator vows to push new gun laws.
[46:34.300 --> 46:37.300]  See, there's all these disgusting defections.
[46:37.300 --> 46:41.780]  White House releases letters from pleading children and then high fives them.
[46:41.780 --> 46:47.100]  They couldn't help but smile.
[46:47.100 --> 46:50.420]  Hospitals to stop delivering babies because of Obamacare.
[46:50.420 --> 46:52.460]  Man, that's incredible.
[46:52.460 --> 46:53.460]  Look at this.
[46:53.460 --> 46:55.340]  NRA plans fight of the century.
[46:55.340 --> 46:57.860]  Citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.
[46:57.860 --> 47:01.300]  Again, that's top right hand side of drugsreport.com.
[47:01.300 --> 47:03.260]  Easiest way to find it, get it.
[47:03.260 --> 47:06.800]  And again, I'm gonna call Watson during a break.
[47:06.800 --> 47:13.140]  And I'm going to basically add the point at the top so that laymen out there don't understand
[47:13.140 --> 47:17.180]  that I've had constitutional lawyers on that agree with this premise.
[47:17.180 --> 47:21.760]  You've got to first put out what's impeachable, and then we link to proof and lawyers and
[47:21.760 --> 47:25.180]  news articles admitting it's impeachable.
[47:25.180 --> 47:28.620]  I mean, him becoming the head of the UN Security Council, which they admitted on the news,
[47:28.620 --> 47:33.020]  violated Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, to serve a foreign power or to hold another
[47:33.020 --> 47:36.300]  office at the same time of government.
[47:36.300 --> 47:37.300]  Totally illegal.
[47:37.300 --> 47:39.700]  I mean, it's a felony.
[47:39.700 --> 47:43.420]  Article I, Section 9, boom, got you right there, boom, got you right there.
[47:43.420 --> 47:45.660]  I mean, we got you over and over again.
[47:45.660 --> 47:52.780]  It'd be like a cop driving by and seeing somebody cooking methamphetamine in their front yard
[47:52.780 --> 47:53.780]  in a bathtub.
[47:53.780 --> 47:54.780]  And you can smell it.
[47:54.780 --> 47:55.780]  You walk up.
[47:55.780 --> 47:56.780]  Is that methamphetamine?
[47:56.780 --> 47:57.780]  Yeah, it's methamphetamine.
[47:57.780 --> 47:58.780]  Boom, you're going to jail.
[47:58.780 --> 48:02.660]  I mean, it's an absolute red-handed.
[48:02.660 --> 48:06.820]  It'd be like catching Jerry Sandusky in the showers raping a kid.
[48:06.820 --> 48:09.320]  Of course, he didn't get in trouble cuz it was a giant pedophile command base.
[48:09.320 --> 48:11.500]  But the point is, that's what it's like.
[48:11.500 --> 48:14.620]  I mean, it is in the act.
[48:14.620 --> 48:20.540]  It is caught in the act, caught in the bank with a gun saying, give me the money.
[48:20.540 --> 48:23.900]  And an off-duty cop pulls a gun or a concealed carry person and says, hands up.
[48:23.900 --> 48:29.260]  And you got security cameras, you got witnesses, you got everybody sought, forgotten country.
[48:29.260 --> 48:32.340]  You were in there saying, give me the money or I'm gonna shoot you.
[48:32.340 --> 48:34.940]  Boom, you're going to prison.
[48:34.940 --> 48:37.940]  There's no doubting it, okay?
[48:37.940 --> 48:40.620]  All we've got to do, see, this is what dictators did.
[48:40.620 --> 48:42.060]  Hitler did it, others have done it.
[48:42.060 --> 48:44.360]  Lenin didn't grab all the power right away.
[48:44.360 --> 48:46.960]  They slowly get away with whatever they want.
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.340]  They slowly do whatever they want.
[48:51.340 --> 48:55.020]  And listen, even in East Germany, one of the greatest police states ever, they had all
[48:55.020 --> 48:58.260]  these great rights and liberties in their constitution, just no one followed them.
[48:58.260 --> 49:04.340]  And it took citizens not complying, saying no, criticizing the system, whisper campaigns,
[49:04.340 --> 49:09.260]  supporting good police, going against bad police, until it finally just collapsed.
[49:09.260 --> 49:13.860]  I'm gonna take a few phone calls in this segment and the next, then we're gonna get Pastor
[49:13.860 --> 49:15.820]  Manning on with his take on this show.
[49:15.820 --> 49:18.540]  He prayed for me when I was in New York and he prayed when we were getting stalked by
[49:18.540 --> 49:19.540]  Bloomberg thugs.
[49:19.540 --> 49:23.940]  And I wanna get his take on all this cuz he said, you watch, Obama's gonna try to become
[49:23.940 --> 49:24.940]  a dictator.
[49:24.940 --> 49:25.940]  And I was naive four years ago.
[49:25.940 --> 49:29.040]  I knew he was bad, but I didn't think they'd move this quick.
[49:29.040 --> 49:35.340]  And then we're gonna have Representative Steven Toth, or Toth as he pronounces it, on, who
[49:35.340 --> 49:40.620]  I just saw on, and that is somebody who needs to be in Congress, he's state rep.
[49:40.620 --> 49:47.380]  I just saw him on Wolf Blitzer when I was in the coffee room for about two minutes.
[49:47.380 --> 49:52.780]  And I mean, he was well-spoken, had incredible demeanor, looked super sharp, that is what
[49:52.780 --> 49:53.780]  we need.
[49:53.780 --> 49:57.580]  And he explained, look, I don't care if you pass laws in Congress saying you can take
[49:57.580 --> 49:59.660]  the guns, it would take an amendment.
[49:59.660 --> 50:03.100]  And even that would be unconstitutional cuz it only points out on the right that already
[50:03.100 --> 50:04.100]  exist.
[50:04.100 --> 50:08.180]  We're not gonna put up with this, and Texas is gonna nullify this.
[50:08.180 --> 50:10.620]  And Wolf Blitzer's like, you can't do that.
[50:10.620 --> 50:16.300]  Really, how come all these states then let the illegal aliens be not arrested?
[50:16.300 --> 50:21.260]  He knows what he's talking about, and I haven't talked to him yet, but it sounds like he's
[50:21.260 --> 50:22.260]  a listener.
[50:22.260 --> 50:23.900]  So again, that's what I'm doing here.
[50:23.900 --> 50:26.700]  Let me tell you the real power of this broadcast, by the grace of God.
[50:26.700 --> 50:30.940]  For all my problems, I am a real person who loves liberty and is willing to die for it
[50:30.940 --> 50:32.580]  if it takes that.
[50:32.580 --> 50:37.100]  And I'm on the line here, and the info I'm putting out more and more is getting to other
[50:37.100 --> 50:38.100]  people.
[50:38.100 --> 50:41.920]  And that's exactly what's happening right now, thanks to DrudgeReport.com, Citizens
[50:41.920 --> 50:44.220]  File Articles of Impeachment Against Obama.
[50:44.220 --> 50:48.880]  And I need to write a first line in there that I'm gonna add just explaining.
[50:48.880 --> 50:52.100]  This is how our original Declaration of Independence started.
[50:52.100 --> 50:57.340]  They were Bill of Particulars passed around showing the use of patience in crimes.
[50:57.340 --> 51:00.520]  This can now be picked up by Congress or added to.
[51:00.520 --> 51:04.260]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but were waiting for an offer
[51:04.260 --> 51:09.220]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[51:09.220 --> 51:10.220]  Here's why.
[51:10.220 --> 51:15.540]  Solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators
[51:15.540 --> 51:19.940]  run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[51:19.940 --> 51:23.380]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[51:23.380 --> 51:24.980]  Now here's the best part.
[51:24.980 --> 51:29.660]  Every year, we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[51:29.660 --> 51:34.840]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of
[51:34.840 --> 51:35.840]  each year.
[51:35.840 --> 51:39.580]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[51:39.580 --> 51:44.780]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[51:44.780 --> 51:45.780]  Don't wait.
[51:45.780 --> 51:46.780]  They go fast.
[51:46.780 --> 51:50.220]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[51:50.220 --> 52:00.480]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[52:00.480 --> 52:01.860]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[52:01.860 --> 52:06.460]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,
[52:06.460 --> 52:08.000]  and more into the Bokashi.
[52:08.000 --> 52:11.580]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or
[52:11.580 --> 52:16.060]  the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.
[52:16.060 --> 52:20.500]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[52:20.500 --> 52:24.300]  using fertilizers, the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[52:24.300 --> 52:28.480]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so
[52:28.480 --> 52:32.740]  it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning
[52:32.740 --> 52:34.420]  and no obnoxious odors.
[52:34.420 --> 52:38.980]  To learn more and order your Bokashi online, visit tereganics.com and click on the orange
[52:38.980 --> 52:39.980]  button.

[52:56.580 --> 52:59.840]  Tereganics, life's getting better.
[52:59.840 --> 53:04.460]  Weakened by GMOs, stressed out about money, and blasted by the electric environment.
[53:04.460 --> 53:08.980]  Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.
[53:08.980 --> 53:10.980]  Then I learned about RNA drops.
[53:10.980 --> 53:16.660]  I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions
[53:16.660 --> 53:21.440]  of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other
[53:21.440 --> 53:22.580]  tissues behave.
[53:22.580 --> 53:26.580]  I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I'd been conditioned
[53:26.580 --> 53:27.580]  to believe.
[53:27.580 --> 53:33.420]  I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide
[53:33.420 --> 53:35.580]  me with amazing health and joy.

[53:58.620 --> 54:23.100]  Well, the globalists have really gambled.
[54:23.100 --> 54:30.100]  It was mentioned 49 times and drugs were mentioned zero times, when the drugs are the main cause,
[54:30.100 --> 54:33.700]  the main cause, guaranteed, on record.
[54:33.700 --> 54:37.060]  And Representative Steve Stockman of Obama violates the Constitution, a lot of people
[54:37.060 --> 54:43.180]  will call for his impeachment, NRA ad we're gonna be playing, Obama is elitist hypocrite,
[54:43.180 --> 54:52.420]  toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231 for you to respond to what the globalists
[54:52.420 --> 54:53.420]  are doing.
[54:53.420 --> 54:59.260]  I just wanna say this, I wanna thank God for my provision and protection, and I wanna thank
[54:59.260 --> 55:04.900]  all of you, the listeners, and I wanna thank our AM&FM affiliates, because I know reality
[55:04.900 --> 55:08.160]  is a crazy thing, and I know it sounds wild even having me on the air, and I appreciate
[55:08.160 --> 55:11.380]  all of our stations, we're getting a lot more by the grace of God.
[55:11.380 --> 55:17.660]  I wanna thank the real media, not the state-run media, that have helped us over the years,
[55:17.660 --> 55:24.860]  George Norrie really helped us get to a higher level, DrudgeReport.com just obviously resonates
[55:24.860 --> 55:30.860]  with our analysis, and it's just turbo charging, it's not even the word what we're doing, probably
[55:30.860 --> 55:34.740]  get me killed, this keeps going, but whatever, at least we're gonna beat the globalist.
[55:34.740 --> 55:38.800]  Because I mean, can you imagine, it's like Alex Jones at Infowars.com, it's already a
[55:38.800 --> 55:42.900]  force with a giant rocket strapped to its butt.
[55:42.900 --> 55:47.740]  And so I'm like Wile E. Cody on top of the big rocket lighting the fuse, or Matt Drudge
[55:47.740 --> 55:49.580]  is back there.
[55:49.580 --> 55:55.100]  So I wanna thank you for loving liberty, and listen, when it's all said and done, I know
[55:55.100 --> 55:58.500]  we don't do this because of ego, we do it because we don't wanna be slaves.
[55:58.500 --> 56:03.500]  It's our instinct to get really upset about a bunch of lying crooks trying to disarm us.
[56:03.500 --> 56:06.820]  But when it's all said and done, the people that have fought this tyranny, none of us
[56:06.820 --> 56:08.940]  are perfect.
[56:08.940 --> 56:15.100]  But the folks over at WorldNetDaily, people like Drudge and his crew, my crew, man, there's
[56:15.100 --> 56:16.100]  so few.
[56:16.100 --> 56:19.140]  I mean, I've gotta be honest, there's so few that really are hardcore, that really know
[56:19.140 --> 56:20.140]  what's going on.
[56:20.140 --> 56:25.900]  He's not perfect in many ways, but he defends the Bill of Rights, Michael Savage, I mean,
[56:25.900 --> 56:26.900]  there's just not many.
[56:26.900 --> 56:31.700]  Glenn Beck does nasty stuff to me on the side, but he does a lot of good work.
[56:31.700 --> 56:32.700]  So you know what?
[56:32.700 --> 56:36.380]  As long as he doesn't say Ron Paul's supporters should be arrested again, like he said four
[56:36.380 --> 56:39.780]  years ago, I wanna bury the hatchet with Glenn Beck.
[56:39.780 --> 56:44.940]  I say that a lot and then he comes out and says I'm a fascist, but you know what?
[56:44.940 --> 56:47.260]  Fascists wear fancy suits, they don't wear camo.
[56:47.260 --> 56:49.040]  The devil comes as an angel of light.
[56:49.040 --> 56:53.940]  The devil comes acting all fair and friendly and beautiful, but can you smell the stench
[56:53.940 --> 56:54.940]  of death?
[56:54.940 --> 57:02.980]  I mean, listen, this is so real, folks, we've got to circle the wagons if you want any future.
[57:02.980 --> 57:06.100]  And the issue is we resonate with the public, the public.
[57:06.100 --> 57:09.360]  But the public that's awake and has street smarts.
[57:09.360 --> 57:13.880]  And when you look at the general public, I mean, they're putting out all these fake polls
[57:13.880 --> 57:17.420]  saying only 15% wanna keep their guns, pure bull.
[57:17.420 --> 57:22.260]  I've got scores of scientific polls where the vast majority are pro-gun.
[57:22.260 --> 57:26.580]  The gun culture has been taking over, but people emotionally when they say if it stops
[57:26.580 --> 57:30.820]  the death of little children, would you want more reasonable restrictions?
[57:30.820 --> 57:35.720]  And they call telephone trees of people they know have answered questions before, that's
[57:35.720 --> 57:38.580]  how Rasmussen and all these guys work.
[57:38.580 --> 57:41.940]  And they call up the welfare lady and say, do you want less gun violence?
[57:41.940 --> 57:49.100]  I sure do, take the guns, it doesn't matter if 99% said that I had to be fed to the sharks
[57:49.100 --> 57:52.980]  for no reason, you can't do that in a republic, we're not a pure democracy.
[57:52.980 --> 57:57.220]  The Greeks had a pure democracy for a while in some of their city states, they'd have
[57:57.220 --> 58:02.040]  a bucket of white rocks for a yes vote, black rocks for a no vote.
[58:02.040 --> 58:08.460]  And the voters would go and put their rocks in there.
[58:08.460 --> 58:11.460]  Only the upper gentry got to vote, but that was a democracy of the elite.
[58:11.460 --> 58:15.740]  And who doesn't like what Aesop just said?
[58:15.740 --> 58:21.060]  I don't like it, well, the rocks say, 90% of the rocks say, Aesop, we're gonna throw
[58:21.060 --> 58:23.660]  you off that cliff, we're gonna make you drink hemlock.
[58:23.660 --> 58:28.180]  I mix them all together, most of the famous philosophers you hear about were killed.
[58:28.180 --> 58:32.020]  You know what, we don't like what you say, you're gonna die.
[58:32.020 --> 58:36.060]  How's that sound, see, cuz the pen is mightier than the sword.
[58:36.060 --> 58:43.220]  But when they come for the sword, you know they're dropping the hammer.
[58:43.220 --> 58:50.340]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.340 --> 58:53.420]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[58:53.420 --> 58:58.420]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[58:58.420 --> 59:04.460]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[59:04.460 --> 59:05.460]  to the global takeover.
[59:05.460 --> 59:11.460]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[59:11.460 --> 59:15.100]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[59:15.100 --> 59:20.100]  We've got the life straw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[59:20.100 --> 59:24.820]  The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[59:24.820 --> 59:25.820]  in the field.
[59:25.820 --> 59:28.900]  Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.
[59:28.900 --> 59:31.340]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein.
[59:31.340 --> 59:36.260]  TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[59:36.260 --> 59:39.120]  Hand crank shortwave AM-FM radios.
[59:39.120 --> 59:43.580]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com,
[59:43.580 --> 59:46.260]  and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[59:46.260 --> 59:47.420]  We're getting prepared.
[59:47.420 --> 59:48.420]  Are you?
[59:48.420 --> 59:49.420]  Infowarshop.com.
[59:49.420 --> 01:00:05.180]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.980]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:10.980]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:13.100]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:17.300]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:27.620]  All right, we're going to be taking your calls now, and when Pastor Manning and when the
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.660]  state rep comes on, who's been fighting the globalist.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:40.660]  Most of the resistance is right here out of Texas, Wyoming, a little bit out of Tennessee.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:46.500]  And it's all people who know that their ancestors fought to protect the Second Amendment.
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.360]  And there's resistance out of Kentucky, there's resistance out of Oregon.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.700]  Let's go to some phone calls right now.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:57.380]  Remember folks, if we beat these people, you're all gonna be remembered as the next generation
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.020]  of founding fathers and mothers.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.620]  I mean, this is the same kind of battle against even more evil people.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.780]  I mean, and the King of England was a cupcake compared to what we got.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.460]  Patriot poet in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.340]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.740]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:16.100]  Hey, this is Google Bomb guy, man.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.100]  You're from Michigan.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.100]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.380]  You're the guy that came up with the idea for the Google Bomb.
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.380]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.380]  How you been?
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.380]  I had to take a break, Alex.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.260]  Things got so crazy.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.940]  But I got back as a member.
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:27.940]  I can't get on the site.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:28.940]  Prison Planet's just jammed up.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:29.940]  I had you on through Infowars.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:38.780]  That's the only way I could get a feed was to listen, and I'm a member on prisonplanet.tv.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.780]  Well, I'm sorry.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:44.700]  You need to send a customer service email over there, and they'll try to get back to
[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.700]  you on that.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.260]  We've changed the configuration of it, works a little bit better, but thank you for the
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.260]  support.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.260]  Listen, we're going to run out of time real quick.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.900]  It's good to talk to you, like we're sitting around here at the gas station on the bench,
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:58.220]  but do you got any comments about what's just been announced that happened?
[01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:03.020]  Yeah, what I wanted to share with you is how far they've reached in, not just only with
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.540]  the Second Amendment, but a total takeover.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.860]  I want to show you how far this tyranny has reached in.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.420]  This happened this morning, Alex.
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.100]  I got to share this with you.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:21.340]  The big conglomerate in Michigan for energy is DTE, which was Detroit Edison, right?
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:27.380]  Well, they've got this program running where they'll come in your home, and they'll change
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:32.100]  all your light bulbs out to those energy star compact fluorescent light bulbs.
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.100]  No, no, no, no.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.900]  And then later, they come by law, and you get fined if you don't have those light bulbs,
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.140]  and then it's forced from inspections.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.020]  They're just getting you used to it.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.020]  Right.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:46.180]  And they tried to walk, listen to this, with the maintenance man, they came trying to enter
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:53.740]  my girlfriend's apartment without her permission, they were with the maintenance guy with the
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:57.780]  keys to their apartment without even calling her, and they tried to just literally walk
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.780]  to her-
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.800]  No, no, listen, we're about five years behind Australia and England.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.740]  They always start this stuff as voluntary, then it becomes mandatory.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:06.740]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:07.740]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:11.180]  Send an email to customerservice at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:14.460]  Okay, let's go to Shannon in Ohio.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.460]  You're on the air.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.460]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.460]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:22.700]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for about five years now, Alex, and I woke a lot of
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.700]  guys up.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.700]  I wasn't being a freak.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:29.300]  I come at them slow just to open them up a little bit, and I bet with just me reaching
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.700]  out, I probably touched like 2,000 people.
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.300]  I've got some guys that are ready.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300]  We're all sitting back waiting.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.300]  We're all fathers.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:40.100]  We take care of our kids, and we're ready.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.660]  We know that we all got to stand up.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.580]  I've been a boxer my whole life, I've fought professional fighters.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.460]  All I can tell these guys is don't be scared.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:55.100]  Once you break the ice and stuff hits the fan, just be ready, and trust me, the spirit
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:01.140]  of our founding fathers will be with you and give you the strength to see you through,
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.140]  okay?
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.920]  Well, that is the good part about a fight, not that I'm a professional fighter, but it's
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.260]  like that in anything.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:10.140]  You're concerned until it starts, but boy, once it starts, it's like a duck to water,
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.140]  isn't it?
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.140]  Yes, it does.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:17.580]  It's just your body takes over, and you're capable of doing so much that you just got
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580]  to break the ice.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.580]  Don't be scared.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.140]  Don't be scared, anybody, because I tell you what right now, I'd rather stand and fight
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:27.140]  than get down on my knees like a coward and let them do what they want to do.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.220]  They're not well-meaning, reasonable guys that want to take guns for little kids.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.940]  They have those little kids up there to make them look like good guys.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:38.460]  These are mafia scum that have sworn to get all our guns to make us slaves.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.560]  And listen, I know you're ready to physically fight.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:44.700]  Put that energy like you already said you did, my brother, into info war.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:48.380]  Redouble, redouble, redouble again, waking people up.
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.980]  You are the Paul Revere.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.940]  You are the resistance.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:52.940]  God bless you.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:54.660]  Shannon, good to hear from you.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:00.760]  George, Andy, Bill, Chris, your calls are all coming up, and Pastor Manning as well.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.740]  Tons of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.820]  Don't be one of them.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:10.940]  Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.940]  solution.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.620]  Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:20.740]  used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:21.740]  healing.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.840]  Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:30.940]  the causes of many serious diseases such as strep, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and
[01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.500]  other harmful pathogens.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:37.380]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:41.520]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.180]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.040]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:04.820]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:09.420]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.280]  by a disastrous economy.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.980]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:17.780]  At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.700]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:25.260]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores
[01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:30.060]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.060]  and niece.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:34.860]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.100]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.460]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:47.020]  Call 800-409-5633 today or go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex and build your food supply.

[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:56.500]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:00.060]  You can bet your life on e Foods Direct.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:13.100]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:17.940]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:22.900]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.900]  Dallas.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:29.900]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.900]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:40.100]  It was almost as if there were planned implosions.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.100]  It just pancakes.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:49.100]  Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:09:05.100]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:11.100]  of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.100]  The guns will be taken.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.100]  No one will ever be armed.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.100]  We're going to take all guns.
[01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.100]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:16.100]  city.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.100]  Is global governance at last?
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.100]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.100]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.100]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:41.580]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.140]  I am committed.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.800]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.520]  And now we've got police chiefs, sheriffs all across the United States from Texas to
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:57.500]  Washington State to Kentucky, sending letters to Obama saying, I am declaring a declaration
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.900]  of independence against your tyranny.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.380]  I will not follow unlawful orders.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:08.060]  And we need more towns, more cities, more county judges like Judge Head in Lubbock,
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:12.300]  who were getting on the show, talked to his office yesterday, to stand up and say, we're
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.380]  not going to comply with this.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.220]  And when Wolf Blitzer and people say, well, you've got to comply with whatever the federal
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.660]  government says, why, Obama's the second coming of Abraham Lincoln.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.020]  Notice they've been saying that for five years.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.180]  And I said, because they're getting ready for insurrection in the states.
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.860]  And now they're saying, yeah, he's gonna be Lincoln.
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:31.260]  He's gonna do whatever he wants.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.940]  They want to cause a physical civil war.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:34.940]  I got an idea.
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.220]  How about we have an info civil war?
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.260]  Okay, how about we stand up and say no?
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:44.480]  Just like what Pastor Manning did last year, where he had a public trial that got a lot
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.460]  of the news, laying out Obama and his criminal activities.
[01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.020]  People go, well, what's the point of his citizens trial?
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:55.500]  You put publicly out there what the person's done.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:11:00.320]  Many times people write a book exposing some criminal thing someone's done, and years later
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.980]  they get brought to justice.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.880]  We've had police officers and others on that are trying to bring Bill Ayers and others
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.760]  to justice for bombings.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.900]  They have evidence they were connected to but didn't stay in prison for.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.680]  And they've got witnesses, and it's the same thing.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:23.660]  You've got to keep going after them, and that's why I put out a citizen's filing of articles
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:24.800]  of impeachment.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.560]  Because it lists from deep research from constitutional lawyers, all of the different things he's
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.140]  done that are impeachable on their face and beyond that.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:42.440]  There's a new hostage crisis, Al Qaeda Link Group says seven Americans among 41 hostages
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.860]  seized in Algeria attacked.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:50.120]  Our government is giving unlimited weapons in Libya and Syria to Al Qaeda jihadis who
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.540]  were then running all over Africa attacking people.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.380]  I mean, that's one of the articles of impeachment, it's admitted.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.160]  Our government is giving heat-seeking missiles to these people.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.180]  They're putting the Muslim Brotherhood in all these countries.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:05.460]  And then saying the TSA needs to go down my pants because of them.
[01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:10.880]  Look at DrudgeReport.com, citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:16.240]  Second congressmen suggest impeachment, see, one said impeachment yesterday if he tries
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.520]  executive orders.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.840]  And see, notice Obama made all these announcements, but he won't say what the particulars are.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.000]  Well, guess what?
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.400]  We've written the articles from the different Democratic Party meetings they've had with
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.000]  Emanuel and Attorney General Holder, and they've said what it's gonna be.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.840]  Okay, so he's gonna do executive orders on ammo, on importation.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.040]  I'm gonna go over that after Pastor Manning leaves us cuz I don't wanna hog the time we've
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.600]  got with him.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.480]  But citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.040]  I put out the fact that I'm a citizen, Alex Jones, signed by me.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.720]  I'm putting out in the court of public opinion in the decade leading up to 1775, 1776.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.680]  That's what the colonies did is they circulated petitions to government saying you better
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.840]  stop, you better stop.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.120]  So I'm putting out what you've done.
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.040]  I have a media platform like a newspaper and I'm saying you're committing crimes, I want
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.040]  you impeached.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.960]  My name's John Hancock, my name's Alex Jones, and I don't wanna be a founding father in
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:12.960]  Rebirth of the Republic.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.000]  I'm just doing my job, but believe me, all of you fighting these tyrants are the John
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.040]  Handcocks, are the Patrick Henrys, are the Sam Adams.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.840]  All of us that are in the media are like Sam Adams.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.880]  The folks at The Drudge Report are like Sam Adams, people at World Net Daily are like
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.920]  Sam Adams.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.660]  You're like Sam Adams, you're like Sam Adams.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.340]  We've gotta hit them with the info war, the truth.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:40.080]  Now I give you James David Manning, a chief pastor at the Atla World Missionary Church,
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.180]  reaches millions of people every month online in a big church there in town and has a huge
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.280]  soup kitchen program.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.640]  It's non-government run for the citizens of the area.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:53.320]  And of course, they attacked the welfare state, that's why the establishment hates them, on
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:59.720]  the 123rd Street in New York City and has been an atlas since 1981.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.120]  And he's a very well-spoken gentleman and very knowledgeable.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:06.840]  I didn't think Obama was as bad as he was saying five years ago when I had him on and
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.080]  then three years ago, but it's certainly starting to get really scary.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.920]  And he prayed for me, and I appreciate that, when we were in New York.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.480]  And he prayed because what he laid out is exactly true, and I wanted to repeat that.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.520]  Because I had that same feeling before I saw his video, I had this thought.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.940]  God laid it into my mind, my spirit, hey buddy, you're anti-gun.
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:29.960]  You're fighting the anti-gun guys.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:37.340]  They will use a anti-gunner to kill you crazy to then say, see, even this pro-gunner got
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.260]  killed by somebody with a gun.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:43.700]  And he said God laid that upon his heart, so I wanted to get him on to talk about this
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.840]  and give his basic take on what's happening.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.680]  Pastor, thanks for popping in with us today.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.280]  Thanks, Alex, thanks for having me today.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.600]  Glad to be on your broadcast.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.080]  Well, I've been ranting and raving.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.960]  You've just seen the speech, high-fiving, using kids.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.080]  What is your take on what's happening?
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.360]  Well, several things have happened.
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:07.040]  Let me just point out the fact that I am convinced that the CNN conference panel, the interview
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.360]  that they had after you were being on there with Piers Morgan, was a direct attempt to
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:16.760]  suggest to some crazy loon out there to take you out.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.840]  I'm confident of that.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.080]  And that's the reason why I prayed.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.920]  I think all Americans need to understand what they're trying to do.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.060]  They want to silence you.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:31.040]  You have become the voice for patriots and Americans, for gun owners and Americans, for
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.240]  the Second Amendment.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.360]  You are indeed the spokesman for that.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.080]  I'm surprised that the NRA has not called you over and enlisted you to help them to
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.700]  protect Americans and their rights to own guns.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:45.000]  You are the spokesman for a well-armed militia.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.440]  And Obama doesn't want that.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.440]  We need to be aware of the fact that Obama is the type of person, and the people we're
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.920]  dealing with at present, they are the type of people that will take you out.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.460]  They have no problems seeing you put in a grave and sending someone to take you out,
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:06.520]  or even sending someone perhaps from the military or some other organization to take you out.
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.400]  So that's the reason why I prayed, Alex.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.360]  Now, you asked me another question a few moments ago about what's happening with Obama using
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:16.920]  children as a shield, like Saddam Hussein did in his conference today.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.920]  Is that what you're asking me about?
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.920]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920]  Yeah.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.200]  That's what he did.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:29.720]  I think that he is tear-jerking the American people, tugging at their heartstrings by putting
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:32.680]  those children up there and using them as pawns.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:38.600]  It looked like a chess game with Obama being the king and Joe Breakdancer Biden being the
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.720]  queen and those little children being the pawns around him, pushing forward his executive
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.880]  orders on gun control, taking our weapons.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.440]  That's what that was all about today.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.800]  How did you know Obama was gonna be so bad?
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.640]  Because I mean, I didn't support him, but I didn't imagine he was this evil four years
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.640]  ago.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.240]  You know, one of the things, Alex, I tell people all the time that I am a spiritual
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.760]  individual and a lot of people have problems with that, some people are able to understand
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760]  it.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:16.240]  But I saw spiritually, Alex, in this band, the depths of the evil that he represents
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.200]  and that's what he would do to this nation.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:24.600]  And I began to scream as loud as I could when I first saw him appear on the scene and then
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:31.000]  as he moved closer to winning the office of presidency, although illegally, and the hysteria
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  around him.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.320]  I saw that this is an evil man and, Alex, it ain't over with yet.
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.320]  It ain't hardly over with yet.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.240]  We have a lot more evil coming from this man that we have to endure.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.480]  But I can say this, I'm confident that we will prevail, that he will not win.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:53.280]  We will get the victory in this process, but it will not be easily won.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:59.160]  And it will not be for the faint of heart to persevere against what Obama is trying
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.560]  to do to us as a people.
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.120]  Did you notice that Biden could hardly stop smiling?
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.760]  He was fighting, smiling, and Obama was trying to act sad, but he acted like that, you know,
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.840]  he was at the Kentucky Derby in front row seats.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.160]  I mean, he acted like a pig and you know what?
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.240]  Well, I think that Biden finally feels that he's given some recognition, something that
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.560]  will give him a legacy.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.800]  I'm not sure exactly what Biden was up about today.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.400]  Obama was very coy today.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:34.360]  He was not his usual, I bully himself, and he wasn't quite as arrogant today as he normally
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.360]  is as well.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.440]  I'll have to look at that again and really read what went on there.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:44.600]  Well, I saw the cover he was acting coy, but in the eyes, he looked evil.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.360]  I mean, in fact, we're hearing more of this from his people.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.960]  You saw the nice Obama.
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.520]  Now you're going to see the real Obama.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.840]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.180]  I think this this so-called second term that he is employing, that we're going to see the
[01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.180]  real Obama.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:01.920]  We're going to see really what he's made of and the evil.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.120]  I don't think he's going to make any attempts to hide anything.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:11.360]  I'm not surprised that he's not probably promoting Muslim Brotherhood and Islamic ideas more.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.920]  We're going to see who he really is in this.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.160]  I saw this four years ago.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.160]  It's amazing.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:22.980]  We're going to go to break, but I want to ask your take on ways to oppose him and to
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:23.980]  push for impeachment.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:28.960]  I mean, don't we need to list all the impeachable crimes he's committed and really press Congress
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.400]  to start the impeachment trial?
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:39.320]  Well, you know, I had a CIA Columbia Obama Sedition and Treason trial regarding his forged
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.520]  certificate of graduation from Columbia.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:50.000]  I explored in depth, Alex, his participation with the CIA, with the Mujahideens in Afghanistan
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.240]  when the Soviet Union invaded them back in nineteen seventy nine, I think it was.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.320]  I went through that step by step and I discovered that Obama...
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]  Stay there.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320]  I want to talk about this.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.320]  You got a federal visit.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.760]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.360]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.200]  by a disastrous economy?
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.920]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:18.720]  At E Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.640]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:26.200]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, Almost all the grocery stores
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:31.000]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  and niece.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.800]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.040]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.400]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.680]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:11.960]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:15.560]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:20.600]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.120]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.120]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.760]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.480]  And they're so easy to use.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.520]  You just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:40.680]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.760]  Fake TV is only $34.95.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:50.480]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com.

[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.200]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.720]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.720]  IRAs?
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:39.800]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.480]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.960]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.960]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:03.600]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.600]  Box.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.520]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:12.320]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:16.640]  House at a time when only the President could obtain its world-class healer.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.200]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.280]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.420]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.560]  normal cell.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.320]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:41.320]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:49.240]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.600]  That's your immune system.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.120]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:18.840]  Pastor Manning is our guest for one more segment.
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.360]  I want to get him back in the next few weeks for a full hour.
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.560]  ATLA.org is his website, A-T-L-A-H.
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:31.680]  In the next segment, we are now analyzing the vague statements of Obama, but they track
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.040]  and follow exactly what we thought in the proposal.
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.680]  I have this from the Washington Times, where they're just gonna take guns whenever they
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.400]  find them in your car, even if they're legal, and you have no warrants.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.680]  And then they're going to decide if you get them back, and it's a no-fly, no-buy list.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.220]  They're just gonna put you on a no-gun list.
[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:57.760]  And it's official, DHS to expand and formalize coordination on gun control efforts.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.560]  Homeland Security is the takeover arm, and it will now be used to go after gun owners.
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:09.440]  Okay, Pastor Manning, you got cut off by the break, and you were getting into the public
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.540]  trial you put on to demonstrate all this.
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:17.080]  It's the same thing with a move towards impeachment, getting behind congressmen that are talking
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.920]  about it, getting the points out about why we should impeach.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.640]  We've got to get on the offensive.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.000]  What is your take on ways to turn the tide, because these guys are coming for us?
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.800]  Well, the impeachment idea is a good idea.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.640]  Whether or not we can succeed with that is the question, because the Senate has to approve
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.840]  of it.
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.880]  And the Senate is right now controlled by the Democrats, Harry Reid, and so I'm not
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.200]  sure you're gonna be able to actually put an impeachment through on Obama.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:51.860]  But it will be at least something to keep the nation aware of the fact that this man
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:57.760]  is indeed evil, and probably force him to make a move, or force the American people
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:03.200]  to just outright reject him, no confidence in him, whether the impeachment goes forward
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200]  or not.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.920]  So I think the action is a good action.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.620]  Absolutely, well, nobody thought the Senate was gonna go after Nixon, but then they got
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:10.620]  the votes.
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:14.360]  It never even had to go to the Senate, because they had the hearings in the House.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.640]  We need real fast and furious hearings.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.260]  We need real hearings on the psychotropic drugs.
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:24.480]  We need real hearings on all of his insider trading and the Democrats' insider trading.
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.720]  We need to get on the offensive with these guys.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.560]  Well, yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.860]  And that's the move I think is most important, that we go on the offense.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:35.520]  Right now, we've been defending against the thing, he comes out and does something, and
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.520]  we react to it.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.200]  Well, that needs to stop, it needs to stop immediately.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.520]  And we need to move against him confidently, not being afraid of all the stereotypes and
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.600]  all the things that have protected him over the past three years.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:53.040]  So offense is indeed the defense that we need to employ against Obama at this time.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.960]  Why do you think they're in such a hurry to get the guns?
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.400]  I mean, the Germans are demanding their gold back.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.840]  We know that they're raising taxes, the economy's gonna crater.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.040]  I mean, what is Obama's endgame?
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.560]  I think the economy getting ready to crater is perhaps one of the pressing reasons why
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.000]  Obama wants to take the guns, because we're gonna see ourselves in another year or so
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  out in the streets begging for bread, or at least the economy being so cratered that people
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.680]  will be unemployed and people will be ready to take to the streets.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:24.120]  So that's the reason why he needs guns out of the hands of people.
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:29.080]  But the other thing, Alex, I told you that when I was on your broadcast, I think three
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.000]  or four years ago, that Obama does not want to give up this power that he has.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.100]  But unlike any other president, he is closer to and employs more power than any other president
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:42.400]  in the history of this nation.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.880]  And he very possibly sees the opportunity to stay in office as long as he possibly can.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:52.720]  Martial law is one way, and if calling for martial law, he can have guns on the street.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.620]  So take them out of the way right away, remove that obstacle, and then deploy the other kinds
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:58.800]  of things he wants to do.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:03.520]  You know, a congressman has pointed it out, you pointed it out so eloquently about Obama's
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.160]  the king, Biden's his queen, the little kids are pawns.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.200]  We've got to come up with a 3D graphic of that or something for the nightly news pastor.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.760]  But I mean, I think Obama's got a problem overreaching using these little kids like
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]  pawns.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.120]  I mean, this was a sickening display.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.200]  That's exactly the kind of stuff Saddam Hussein pulled.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.800]  Normally, I can stomach a lot of stuff, Alex.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.840]  And when Obama has crowds of black people or Hispanic people or whoever behind him,
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.840]  women or whoever.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:37.160]  I mean, I can deal with it, it's just politics, he's promoting himself, they want an opportunity
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.160]  to be there.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.600]  But this was a terrible misuse, a bastard misuse of these children today.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.840]  And calling their names and using them to promote his diabolical plans, I thought was
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.400]  just off the charts.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.160]  Well you're right, again, Pastor Manning, we've only got about a minute left, anything
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.440]  else you think is important to add for folks?
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.200]  Well, I want to ask America to pray for you, Alex.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:05.800]  I mean, I don't think people realize just how serious this issue is.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:11.420]  Obama wants our guns, he wants this nation, he wants to trash the Constitution and you
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:15.800]  are a powerful voice that have fired up the American people.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:21.000]  And people need to stand with you, they need to pray for you, that God will sustain you
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.640]  through this battle that's ahead of us.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:27.200]  So my one request before leaving today is that all Americans would bow their knee and
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.920]  their heads in continual prayer for your safety and your abilities to keep doing what you're
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.920]  doing.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.920]  Wow, thank you, Pastor.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.800]  We need to pray for you as well and for everybody fighting against evil.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.720]  But I know it's the prayers that are sustaining me.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.920]  From the bottom of my heart, I feel that connection with you, Pastor.
[01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:43.920]  Thank you, sir.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:44.920]  God bless you, sir.
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:45.920]  God bless you.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:50.120]  Man, we'll be right back with State Rep who's fighting.

[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:14.360]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're joined for the balance of the hour and I promise everybody
[01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:40.120]  holding, we're gonna get to all your calls for the entire third hour and cover this foggy
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:44.040]  legislation but it's not foggy and so I have this huge responsibility.
[01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:47.500]  I'm gonna go back to all our articles we've written the last two weeks, well even before
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:52.680]  that the last month where we went back through Handgun Control Incorporated and these different
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.920]  meetings they've had that have been on C-SPAN with the Attorney General and others and they've
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.760]  laid out what they're gonna do.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:03.560]  And they're just gonna pull over gun owners and harass you.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.240]  They're going to raid people's houses claiming you've got illegal guns.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:12.240]  They're going to just say, we say you're mentally ill, you can't own a gun now.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:16.520]  They're gonna, upwards of $5 billion additional funding to harass gun owners.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:20.280]  They're gonna try to ram through legislation to physically make you turn them in, Dianne
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.440]  Feinstein has that.
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:28.660]  And it's totally, absolutely unconstitutional.
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:32.200]  And it's unconstitutional on its face and we have President Obama running four years
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.380]  ago pledging to never try to take any guns.
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:39.660]  And you have the FBI crime statistics of gun crime the last 15, 16 years, we're gonna show
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:45.820]  these again in a moment, down 49% nationwide on average and 20 plus percent reduction in
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.320]  total violent crime.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.320]  I mean, the big secret is crime where guns are used is going way down, but I don't wanna
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.040]  hog the time here.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:35:01.200]  Representative Steve Toth joins us and he's made national news coming up with a legislative
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:08.000]  plan to battle back against this and for the state of Texas to not recognize unconstitutional
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.160]  federal laws.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:12.200]  Even if they tried to get, just to explain to people cuz I was watching them on both
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:15.280]  Blitzer and he'll be able to elaborate on this, Blitzer was interrupting him, acting
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.640]  like it was just preposterous.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:21.280]  Congress could pass a law saying turn your guns in, it's really unconstitutional and
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.960]  abhorrent and you'd have to get a constitutional amendment.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.600]  And even that is highly debatable because it doesn't give you the right, it points out
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.080]  the unalienable, unalienable right that's already there.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:39.520]  So he joins us, his career began at a company, a Johnson and Johnson company and led to work
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.360]  as a regional trainer where he developed in a practice management consulting program called
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.520]  a residency to retirement.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:51.040]  He served as director of marketing for Apple, it goes on 99.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.800]  The point is he is a entrepreneur out there and not one of these sponges.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:58.840]  And he's been involved with the Tea Party and involved in a lot of different community
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.640]  and church organizations.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:05.160]  And it's just really exciting to have him join us.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.960]  State Representative Steve Toth, thank you so much for coming on, sir.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:11.520]  Hey, Alex, thanks so much for having me.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.520]  You bet.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.120]  I mean, I'm chomping at the bit here because this is so outrageous.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.040]  Why do you think Obama's coming for the guns?
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:21.680]  And what do you think of him like Saddam Hussein surrounding himself with children, and then
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.680]  we'll move into your legislation?
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.440]  Well, I mean, it goes all the way back to Rahm Emanuel.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.040]  Don't let any crisis go to waste.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.040]  This is part of their agenda.
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:37.240]  This has always been part of their agenda to make it difficult for law abiding citizens
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.480]  to own a gun.
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:42.480]  What was your take?
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:45.400]  Did you have a chance to watch his speech?
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.880]  Yeah, I did.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:51.480]  I was actually in the studio here in Austin while he was giving the speech.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:57.160]  And again, it's funny because Wolf Blitzer said, after it was done, he said he gave it
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.160]  in great detail.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.560]  Well, I'm sorry, there are 23 things, and he laid out maybe three or four of them.
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.560]  And at the end of the day, this is no different than Obamacare.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.080]  You deliver a bill that's 4,000 pages that no one has a chance to read, it gets voted
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:17.120]  in, and then it goes miraculously, it goes from 4,000 pages to 40,000 pages.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.080]  And this is how he does things.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:25.480]  It's just, at some point, we've got to say enough is enough, and stand up and say our
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.480]  Constitution matters.
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:32.200]  We're not a democracy, we're a constitutional republic.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.680]  We don't vote on whether or not we have liberty.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:39.120]  We don't vote on whether or not you can or can't do something.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.320]  We have this article, it's called the Constitution, our rights come from God and are enumerated
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320]  in that document.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:50.040]  And it's very clear about what we can and can't do.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:56.240]  I agree with you, and your call for the Second Amendment Preservation Act here in Texas has
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.800]  become a big national story.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:04.220]  A lot of other states are saying they're gonna try to introduce similar legislation.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:08.840]  And the Wolf Blitzer was trying to interrupt you so that you couldn't explain the constitutionality
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:13.180]  of this and how it works, but I want you to be able to elaborate on it.
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:19.000]  But expanding on that, 800 plus cities, 30-something states last time I checked, don't arrest illegal
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.320]  aliens for even drunk driving because they're just above the law.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.760]  They don't arrest them for being illegal, they don't even take them to be deported.
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.800]  They won't deport most of them most of the time now because Obama signed an order.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:34.360]  Now that's all unconstitutional with the feds and the states ignoring the law.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:38.160]  Well, why can't we ignore federal laws if they're clearly unconstitutional?
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:43.320]  Exactly, I mean, you nailed it, you absolutely nailed it.
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.800]  At some point you've got to draw a line in the sand and say, enough is enough, we're
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:53.400]  not sliding anymore towards a king.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.840]  I grew up in upstate New York.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:02.400]  I moved my family here because we believed it was the greatest state in the nation, greatest
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.520]  opportunity to raise our children in freedom and prosperity.
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.160]  And the thing that gets me about what's going on in New York right now, where they're
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:19.760]  limiting lawful people to own a gun, make it more difficult for them to get a gun, it
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:25.760]  was just three or four weeks ago that this crazed killer, this is a guy that beat his
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:30.520]  mother to death with a hammer, he beat his mother to death with a hammer, bludgeoned
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.520]  her head with a hammer.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:39.400]  And oh, by the way, more people died from being bludgeoned with a hammer than any kind
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.320]  of rifle, let alone an assault rifle.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]  That's right.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.840]  He beat his mother to death with a hammer.
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:55.000]  And then the libs in New York sent him to jail, where they promptly let him out.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  They promptly let him out.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  What did he do?
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:03.800]  He set his house on fire a few weeks ago, shot two volunteer firefighters, first responders,
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.680]  people that, you know, give their lives to save others.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.160]  He shot them like a coward that he is.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.880]  He shot them dead.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.240]  And what does New York state legislation do?
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.100]  Rather than getting on TV and saying, boy, we blew it.
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:22.520]  We haven't made it tough enough on criminals.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.880]  We should have locked this guy away and thrown away the key.
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:29.280]  We should have put legislation in place to ensure that this guy would never see another
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.280]  sunset again.
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.280]  Instead, what do they do?
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.400]  It's this baloney.
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:37.560]  They go and create legislation that has nothing to do.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.560]  This guy got this gun illegally.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:40.560]  He didn't buy it at a gun show.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.360]  He didn't buy it at a shop.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360]  This was a stolen weapon.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.700]  And just, we don't want to have a real discussion about what to do.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:51.960]  We just want theatrics.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.640]  We just want games.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.600]  And it's just, again, it's just another opportunity to erode our rights.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  I agree.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.520]  State representative hailing from Texas, Steve Toth, is our guest.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:07.640]  And we're going to give you his website as well as you want to get behind him and support
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]  him.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.040]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:14.860]  We either get on the offensive like you're doing or it's over because they are going
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.240]  to use these dead children.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.040]  They are going to wrap themselves around this tragedy.
[01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:26.560]  They are going to bill all gun owners as responsible, calling the NRA mass murder enablers, saying
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:32.440]  gun owners are all secretly Ku Klux Klan as Fox Sports, has said, we either get on the
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.920]  offensive and say, in every case, and it's now come out with a Batman shooter that he
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.720]  was on a bunch of psychotropic drugs.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.880]  They've been on drugs where the inserts say they can cause you to commit mass murder or
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.760]  kill yourself, a massive increase.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.480]  The guy that shot an Austin cop for no reason, no reason at a Walmart, was bombed out of
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:53.040]  his brain on Xanax.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.720]  He was a Xanax addict, taking more than what you're even supposed to.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:00.360]  I mean, I've known people on Xanax, it destroys their lives.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.480]  I mean, I've talked to doctors who will not prescribe it.
[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.200]  And of course, I mean, I heard this guy shot a cop for no reason.
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.920]  I said, I bet that guy's on psychotropics.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:11.400]  Boom, he was on antipsychotic, basically.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:16.280]  And now the Batman shooter, Harris, Kleibold, in like 99% of the cases, they're trying to
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:21.280]  suppress the file on Lanza, who tried to buy a gun, not once, not twice, not three times,
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.000]  not four times, five times the month before, couldn't.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.920]  His mother had gone through some of the strictest gun laws in the country to get these semi-autos,
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.840]  if you believe the story.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:35.840]  And again, they ignore all that and say, because a guy that murdered his mother with a hammer
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.720]  went and got an illegal gun and shot people, I've gotta give my guns up.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:44.300]  Because a guy went and killed his mommy and went and killed, it's always devil-worshipping
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.600]  goths on drugs.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.880]  I mean, if anybody needs to be profiled, it's these guys.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.960]  Instead, I've gotta lose my rights.
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:53.800]  So what about getting on the offensive here?
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.080]  Yeah, that's it, exactly.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:43:01.520]  I mean, everyone in every state has gotta take an interest in this thing.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:04.600]  If you think that this is just about guns, you're crazy.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:08.440]  This is about eroding all of your rights.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:14.120]  And I said to Governor Perry last night, and he's behind this as well, and I had such great
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120]  discussion with him.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:20.200]  He walked up to me when I was talking to him about the bill and he grabbed me by both arms
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.440]  and he said, he said, Steve, this isn't about hunting, this isn't about my right to be a
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  sportsman.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.480]  If I want to use an assault-style rifle to kill hogs, that's my right.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.280]  And if I don't want to kill hogs and I just want to have that in my gun safe in case I
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.840]  need it against the federal government or whatever, that's my right.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:39.840]  He is just a liberty-loving.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:40.840]  Absolutely.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:46.720]  And I'm thankful he's my governor, but the deal is y'all need to reach out to your elected
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720]  officials.
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:51.720]  This is a fight that we all need to be involved in, and it's not just about guns, it's how
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:57.200]  we educate our children, it's the kind of food that we eat and drink, it's everything.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.320]  We've gotta stop this and we've gotta stop it now.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:03.080]  Well, I mean, I disagree with Rick Perry on quite a few things like the NAFTA highway
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:11.760]  and stuff, but the governor has been resisting and really defending the Second Amendment.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.680]  And we need to see more of that.
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:19.320]  And I've gotta say, I'm proud of Texas, but also Kentucky, Washington State, many other
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.080]  states that are resisting.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:27.120]  But I have introduced into the public forum articles of impeachment.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.520]  And we've got a Texas congressman who has said he will introduce articles of impeachment.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:38.100]  If Obama tries to use executive orders, well, now he's saying 23 executive orders, but like
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:40.880]  you said earlier, won't tell us what they are.
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:46.620]  Well, I know what they've said they're gonna do, because the anti-gun groups have press
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.620]  conferences on C-SPAN.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:49.800]  I mean, I know what they're gonna do.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:54.600]  They're just gonna have the federal government put you on a list, no judge, no jury, and
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:55.880]  say you can't own a gun.
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:56.880]  They're gonna ban importation.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:57.880]  Go ahead.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:05.960]  A couple days ago, he was talking about there's got to be an administrative fix or solution.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.800]  That's code for registering our guns.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.800]  I'm just here to tell you.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:09.800]  No, that's it.
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:10.800]  Yeah.
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:11.800]  That's it in a nutshell.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:15.600]  And when that happens, we're done.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.600]  We're just done.
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.980]  And, you know, frankly, there needs to be some outrage for those of you that are listening
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:29.800]  in New York, and again, Sheldon Silver and the outrageous leadership that he has demonstrated
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:35.200]  in the state of New York, what he's brought that state down to, it's just a shame.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:41.840]  Well, it's so creepy that Bloomberg and Cuomo and all these people, Diane Feinstein is introduced
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.600]  to Bill, that says you'll have to come re-register your guns and they can, quote, do a forced
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.740]  buyback if they want, all this vague, really draconian language.
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:54.440]  They've all got concealed carry, I've played clips for admitting it, and bodyguards.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.360]  I mean, she's worth $100 million in her financial filings.
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.560]  Most people, I mean, I'm a successful talk show host, but I mean, I don't have the money
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:04.040]  to have bodyguards and stuff.
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.440]  I mean, I know you don't have the money to have bodyguards, I would guess.
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.440]  I don't either.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:12.520]  My campaign manager two years ago was walking through the, Bruce, if you're listening, love
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:18.880]  you buddy, but as he was walking through the parking lot at the Woodlands Mall, two guys
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:23.880]  started following him, so he starts taking the circuitous route around cars and everything,
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:25.200]  and sure enough, they're still following him.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:31.040]  He walks around a van, drops a package, draws, and as they came around the corner, he looked
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.120]  at these two guys and said, yes, can I help you?
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.800]  And they took off running.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:44.760]  He immediately called 911, and like any good concealed handgun licensed owner, he said,
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:46.000]  I was in fear of my life.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.920]  Two men were coming after me, and I drew, and the police arrived.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.440]  He described them, and he said, you know, those two guys, we've been trying to catch
[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:56.440]  them.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:59.600]  Good thing you didn't shoot them, but we've been trying to catch those guys.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:07.480]  They mugged two people that day, so evidently the president and Nancy Pelosi and Dianne
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:15.720]  Feinstein, they're allowed to have protection, but I'm not allowed to protect myself.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:16.720]  It's incredible.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:22.640]  I mean, we have crime maps from local governments compiled then by the FBI, and you can see
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:27.360]  where you have increased gun ownership, you have lower home invasions, lower crime rates,
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:32.440]  lower muggings, lower carjackings, and the area where people are disarmed is where this
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:33.440]  happens.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.640]  I mean, I've been in New York myself, and I weigh 260 pounds, and I'm a pretty strong
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:38.640]  guy.
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:43.160]  I mean, I'm not like He-Man or something, but I can bench press 350 pounds, stuff like
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.160]  that.
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.200]  I've had guys come and sit on both sides of me and ask me what's in my bag and stuff and
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.200]  try to intimidate me.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.200]  Yeah.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:55.640]  I mean, this is not the way I want to live, and it's just so despicable that these mob
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:02.440]  boss types like Rahm Emanuel and people consciously have this criminal instinct to want to disarm
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:03.440]  us.
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  Right.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.400]  That's it in a nutshell.
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:10.760]  Anything that they can do, you know, we don't have the Second Amendment for hunting.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:15.360]  We don't have the Second Amendment for putting trophy guns on our wall.
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.000]  We have the Second Amendment so that we can preserve the First Amendment, which is the
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.040]  free right to assemble and free speech.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.360]  And when people live in fear of the government, we will have tyranny.
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:32.640]  And as soon as they take our guns away from us, and again, this is a slow erosion, we
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.440]  will lose that freedom.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.840]  And we've got to get to the point where we say enough is enough and stand up.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.280]  Well, sure, if the federal government wasn't buying 1.6 billion hollow point bullets, if
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.960]  they weren't deploying armored personnel carriers, if they weren't dressing like Darth Vader,
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.480]  and they weren't trying to gut our borders and calling for world government, if they
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:56.280]  didn't have four network TV shows bad mouthing the founding fathers, I mean, these are obvious
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:57.280]  usurpers.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:01.720]  They're going down the list of things tyrants do and double checking every box.
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:06.400]  So that's all the more reasons, like Jesse Ventura said, when the government disarms
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.320]  and the government lays down its guns, then I'll think about it.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.040]  And obviously, that's tongue in cheek.
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.800]  The point is, is that they are arming against us.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.160]  We need our guns to protect ourselves.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:22.200]  And the media always tries to act like, wow, the state rep just said we need guns to protect
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.200]  ourselves from the federal government.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.200]  Well, that's what the founders said.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.320]  And if you don't like that, you're not an American.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:29.920]  No, I mean, that's not like a new thought.
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:38.440]  I mean, this is something that our founding fathers knew that just like gravity, you know,
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.440]  you hold something in there and you drop it, it's going to hit the ground.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:47.040]  Our liberty, our freedom will erode from the gravity of tyranny.
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.040]  It's the slow erosion.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:49.760]  It's not a quick on off switch.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:51.600]  It's the slow erosion.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.920]  And we have got to be on guard against it.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.720]  It is speeding up at an astronomical rate, exponential rate.
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:07.520]  So yeah, I mean, and yes, our founding fathers said, when government lives in fear of the
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:09.160]  people, there's liberty.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.560]  When people live in fear of the government, there's tyranny.
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:12.560]  They understood that.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.420]  They understood it well because of what they endured through King George.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:17.420]  We don't want another king.
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:23.280]  When we come back, I know listeners already have heard your report on on the WOAI.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.280]  It's already made national news.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.080]  They have the drugs report dot com and info wars dot com.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:28.480]  But I want to come back and give out your website.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:33.800]  But I also want to talk about what your piece of proposed legislation would do and how we
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.040]  would implement it.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.040]  And it's very, very simple.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:39.400]  I mean, the feds won't even pick up the illegal aliens and police do arrest them.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.760]  I've talked to the police has been on the news show if that's illegal and unconstitutional
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:47.920]  because that's something you're supposed to do, then how can the states get in trouble
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.760]  if they don't do something that's unconstitutional?
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.680]  So we're going to talk about your piece of legislation and how we can get it duplicated
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:58.720]  and different ways we can get on the offense against this tyranny with the representative
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.920]  from Texas.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:07.040]  Hemp USA dot org has a newly designed website and a new and improved detoxification product.

[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:35.560]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:36.560]  IRAs?
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.560]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:42.260]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:45.740]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:51.560]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237 don't get left behind by
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:52:01.960]  rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237 secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:04.240]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:09.320]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:11.380]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:16.340]  Vince experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:20.640]  In fact, just a few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:23.880]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:27.180]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:31.080]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:36.760]  That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:39.560]  and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:04.000]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water

[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:29.480]  Now you noticed Obama just said, I want to give everybody free healthcare, you deserve
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.480]  it.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.000]  And then we finally get the bill, it's death panels, it's written by the insurance companies
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.520]  to double your rates, doesn't give anybody free healthcare.
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.880]  Obama says, I'm not gonna raise taxes unless you make a quarter million dollars a year,
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:42.880]  I promise.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:47.200]  Raises a bunch of taxes on poor people, massively.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.480]  I have a responsibility because they bragged to the Washington Post, I've read their quotes,
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.620]  I've watched their press conferences.
[01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:58.260]  We know their attack profile, we know what the 23 executive actions are gonna be.
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:02.760]  We know, and he hinted at a bunch of them in the speech, but I was talking to state
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:08.100]  representative here from Texas who's introduced the Firearms Preservation Act.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:14.320]  And Steve, continuing with what you were breaking down during the break describing what Obama's
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:15.320]  doing masterfully.
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:17.720]  He's like, hey, I just don't want little kids to get killed.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:23.320]  I'm here, I'm gonna propose something, DHS is gonna run it nationwide, $5 billion, get
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.320]  ready.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:27.320]  Yeah, I mean, he's masterful at this.
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:33.200]  It's smoke and mirrors, you hide behind children, you pull the heartstrings to make an emotional
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:36.160]  connection with moms and dads.
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:44.720]  And then you introduce this nebulous legislation, and then once the ne'er-do-wells in Washington
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:52.020]  pass it, then what he does is he takes his bureaucrats, the only thing worse than a politician
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:56.880]  that has been in office too long is a bureaucrat that has been in office too long.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.720]  And these bureaucrats are the ones that craft the legislation once it's passed.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:05.640]  Obamacare was only about 4,000 pages only, right?
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:12.480]  But once it was the bill that you had to pass before you read it, well, that thing is upwards
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.440]  of 40,000 pages of regulation today.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.440]  And the devil in this thing is really truly in the details, and you won't find out what
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.960]  the details are, this is the way he does things.
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:27.360]  The thing is that they're just too controversial to make it onto the House floor or the well
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:28.360]  of the Senate.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:33.380]  That stuff isn't seen, it's not gonna be addressed in this legislation.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:39.480]  And so they're gonna keep it nice and nebulous, warm, fuzzy, children, puppies, and then pass
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.480]  this.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.320]  And then you pass it and you find out that our guns are registered and they're being
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:45.320]  taken away.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:49.600]  And by the way, that's what makes me so angry is that Dianne Feinstein, we have the clip
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.760]  of her saying, if I have my way, all your guns are turned in, Mr. and Mrs. America.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.720]  And then I have her new bill where it says, yeah, you gotta come re-register them, we'll
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.600]  decide if you can keep them, but we need money for a forced buyback.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.680]  And then Obama's up there going, it's just reasonable, we just want crazy people not
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:08.680]  to have guns.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.600]  I mean, it's such a deception.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:17.280]  You'd think once the public learned that they lie so much, then everyone would turn against
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:18.280]  them.
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:20.360]  But it's almost like people have just gotten used to being lied to.
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:25.200]  Well, check this out.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:32.000]  When the liberals say that the war on drugs has been an abject failure, they say it's
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.200]  because interdiction is impossible.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.280]  You can't keep drugs out of the country.
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.720]  You can't keep drugs out of the hands of someone that wants drugs.
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:44.720]  But evidently, they think you can't keep firearms out of the hands of criminals.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:49.240]  I mean, it's just pure- Well, that was my next point.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:51.800]  They're announcing Homeland Security's main duty.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:53.240]  It's not Al-Qaeda anymore.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:57.600]  You've seen the training manuals, gun owners, returning veterans, conservatives.
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.200]  They're now announcing this is what Homeland Security is, is a new thing to harass and
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:07.580]  nickel and dime gun owners, where somebody's got a legal AR-15, not modified, guy has no
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:10.760]  criminal record, businessman, what was it in Minnesota.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:16.140]  He pulls the trigger at the shooting range, it goes full auto, they rat on him, and he
[01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:17.140]  goes to jail.
[01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:21.680]  And the ATF says, we know he didn't do it on purpose, but we still wanna put you in
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.680]  jail.
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.680]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.000]  I know you've gotta go, but I wanna talk about your Firearms Preservation Act, how people
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  find it.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.840]  Fire out the best website, sir.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:35.560]  The best way to get ahold of us at this point is just on Facebook.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:37.560]  Steve for House District 15.

[01:59:53.720 --> 02:00:05.400]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:10.240]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:11.240]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:13.360]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:17.560]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:23.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:28.520]  State representative from Texas, Steve Toth, represents District 15.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:30.560]  And he is almost for five more minutes.
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:34.040]  I've got some big breaking news after he leaves us in the next segment.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:35.840]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.640]  Big breaking news.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:38.640]  And this is confirmed.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:43.360]  This is, well, we'll break it down on the other side and go over what this means.
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:46.960]  Getting into your State Preservation Act, tell people about that.
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:48.840]  I guess they can go to Steve.
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:56.280]  Steve Toth for House District 15 on Facebook.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:00.680]  So that's the best place to visit and- Yeah, that's the best place.
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:03.480]  How do people find a piece of legislation?
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:06.080]  How do they find a copy of it so they can get it to the-
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:09.160]  Yeah, we're not out of legislative council yet.
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.880]  So it's being drafted right now.
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:15.760]  And we've been told that alleged counsel will be done Friday and then it's gonna be in the
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:17.760]  hands of the Attorney General.
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:24.040]  Reason being, we wanna make sure that it's buttoned up as best we can.
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:29.040]  We're gonna put it in his hands and let him dot the I's and cross the T's and then we'll
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:30.680]  go from there.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:34.320]  We only serve in Texas 140 days every two years.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:37.320]  And we can't introduce legislation in the first couple months.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:43.120]  So the neat thing about this, and you're probably familiar with the TSA bill that Representative
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.120]  Simpson put through a couple years ago.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.120]  Absolutely.
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:48.080]  What's the background?
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:54.280]  Well, in the local radio station there in Houston said, well, I hope this isn't like
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.280]  the TSA bill.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:56.280]  It didn't get passed.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:01.840]  Well, the TSA bill didn't catch fire until April or May last year.
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:03.240]  It's January.
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:10.280]  So the nice thing about where we're at right now is that, and thanks to Texans that have
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.320]  just shown so much support for this thing that they're calling their elected officials
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:18.560]  and saying, we're behind this, they're respectfully calling their officials and saying, we're
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.840]  behind this and we appreciate it, you'd be behind it.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:25.800]  And that's the best way to talk to one of these people because at the end of the day,
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:28.800]  we serve here.
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:33.360]  It's really not even, I have a full time job, I own the company, I have employees, and I
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.840]  do this on the side, I'm paid $600 a month, it barely covers your expense.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:41.120]  No, you're a statesman, you're what we need in there.
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:45.560]  And I just appreciate you being on the front lines of this and we've got a good chance
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:50.800]  to get this ram through and it will take time and we've got a good chance to get other states
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:58.160]  to pick it up because what are, in closing, a few other areas we can get on the offense?
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:03.000]  Reach out through social media to people and start the discussion.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:09.080]  I'm amazed when you get under a liberal skin, they're calling my office right now, F bomb
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:11.800]  after F bomb after F bomb.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:17.320]  Because they can't have an intellectual discussion around this because their position is just
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:18.320]  so weak.
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.320]  Well, they're authoritarians.
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:20.320]  Unbelievable.
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:27.440]  So yeah, I mean, we just need to ramp up the discussion and we need to do it with integrity
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:28.440]  and honesty.
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.360]  And I mean, I want to put it back on them too, stop saying we have blood on our hands.
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:37.480]  If anybody has blood on their hands, it's the drug manufacturers putting mentally ill
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:42.840]  people on stuff that's known to cause psychotic outbreaks and it's making public schools gun
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:43.840]  free zones.
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:46.400]  I love the NRA's new ad.
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.320]  It's just a soft target and Wayne LaPierre hit the nail right on the head.
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.840]  The only way to stop an evil person with a gun is a good person with a gun.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.200]  It's the only way it happens.
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:01.040]  You look at all of these shootings that have happened as of late and it wasn't until an
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.840]  armed citizen or a police officer stopped them.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.840]  Well said.
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:07.840]  Period.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:08.840]  So.
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:11.120]  Appreciate you, Representative.
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:15.000]  Thank you so much for spending time with us and thank you for being a leader for Texas
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  and America.
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  Appreciate it.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  Thanks so much.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  Thank you.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  He'll know more tomorrow, by the way, as as more of Obama's plans leak out.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:27.880]  Let me tell you, that's what makes this so much worse is that they are going with a sneaky
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.120]  angle.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:30.140]  But that's what they always do.
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:35.200]  He writes the NDA, then says he's against it, then says, don't worry if it passes.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.200]  I'll veto it.
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.440]  Then he doesn't veto it.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:38.440]  He signs it.
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:39.440]  It turns out he wrote it.
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:42.240]  That was all the plan.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:45.720]  So there's no telling what they're going to do and then they're going to get the legislation
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:49.720]  written up separately and then have another mass shooting and then just sign a bunch of
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:50.800]  executive orders.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:55.280]  But we've got some very important news I'll announce after the break.
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:58.560]  Then we'll go to all the callers that are holding eight hundred to five at nine nine

[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.600]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.280]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:16.800]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:18.040]  on Earth.
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:22.860]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

[02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:30.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go to your phone calls here to respond
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:32.840]  to the president's nebulous announcement.
[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:38.720]  They have told us 23 orders and executive orders, legislation.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.860]  We know the plan.
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:41.760]  It's Dianne Feinstein's bill.
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:47.160]  It's the other ten bills that are in Congress, taxes on ammo, background checks on ammo,
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:50.200]  re-gun registration, can't sell guns to anybody.
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:53.820]  When you die, you've got to turn your guns in.
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:59.120]  Can't transfer anything semi-auto, can't even sell it to a gun dealer.
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:03.320]  Government wants to put you on a no gun buy list, no judge, no jury, you're just on it.
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:07.060]  They said last week in a press conference on C-SPAN what they were gonna do.
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:12.220]  The attorney general, the Chicago mob boss, Rahm Emanuel, all of them.
[02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:14.920]  And they got up there and they laid it out.
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:18.620]  And we've gone over it, but I'm gonna have my writers go back through and just say, here's
[02:09:18.620 --> 02:09:19.620]  the plan.
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:23.120]  I mean, if you had the December issue of the magazine, even before Sandy Hook, we tell
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:24.120]  you the plan.
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:28.760]  It's been the same plan Dianne Feinstein's had for 20 years, where she says, if I ever
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:33.000]  get the votes, Mr. and Mrs. America, you're gonna turn your guns in, okay?
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.480]  And then we're like, hey, folks, Obama's gonna try to take your guns.
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:40.600]  He said he'd never take any of my guns, that's a firm pledge.
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:45.480]  He also pledged to not raise anybody's payroll taxes, but some of the lowest paid Americans
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.400]  got them, 77% of tax paying Americans have their payroll tax raised.
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.180]  He will make them $30,000 a year.
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:10:01.120]  And it's so sad, these gullible people, because they look at you like, you're just mad cuz
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:02.700]  you're not on the winning team.
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:05.520]  And then meanwhile, Obama is totally chomping these people.
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.840]  I mean, they really think, their guy got in, everything's great.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:14.480]  I've got the Washington Times here breaking down his point.
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:18.100]  And it just goes over, it's basically just track everybody's guns and get them all registered
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:23.140]  so they can take your guns and harass gun owners and go after everybody.
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:25.460]  Also then we're going to your calls here.
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:32.640]  Also we've got DHS to expand formalized coordination on gun efforts, gun control efforts.
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:37.360]  So I told you, internally, they're all about getting our guns, it's not about Al-Qaeda,
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:39.840]  which they use in Libya and Syria.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:43.080]  Or who they let get on the plane to come over here so they can put naked body scanners in.
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:46.720]  Al-Qaeda is used to take your liberties, okay, period.
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:51.480]  And DHS does one thing, they train to take on veterans and gun owners, libertarians,
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:53.600]  conservatives, and rural communities.
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:58.160]  They see you as the undomesticated who don't wanna be a little collectivist with them,
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:10:59.160]  okay?
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:04.600]  They want you dumbed down, on welfare, begging for an Obama phone.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.240]  And by the way, you want welfare, you gotta take these shots that kill you better than
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:09.240]  a hammer down the road.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:12.480]  Here's the Daily Caller reporting.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:17.000]  There is now a second congressman, second GOP congressman suggests impeachment over
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.160]  executive action for gun control.
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:21.040]  And see, Obama blinked.
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:23.600]  He said he's gonna have executive orders and said it's for the kids.
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:27.400]  That way they can just say, hey, we gotta do something, it's for the kids, aren't I
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:28.400]  sweet?
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:31.440]  It's for the kids, like Saddam Hussein high-fiving kids.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:36.320]  I high-five the kids, I high-five, we're gonna show you that video coming up.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:40.280]  It's on YouTube, we got it up at infoawards.com.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:45.020]  We are gonna do a great job, we high-fived.
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:49.040]  And then meanwhile, well, you gotta get behind the bill, and it's a gun confiscation bill.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:56.320]  But they never even say that, knowing most of the public doesn't go and read legislation.
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:01.840]  So there is all of that info, and that is exactly what we expected.
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:06.600]  Now here's the announcement, and I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:11.280]  Something that absolutely, yeah, there it is, totally disgusting if you're a radio listener
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:16.200]  and the crowd is clapping, and the kids high-five Obama.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:21.680]  He looks to the kids and he says, I'm gonna get it done for you, because you've written
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.100]  me letters and this is what you want.
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:30.240]  He wants to steal their birthright, so they live in a big mega city being raped and robbed
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:31.640]  and taxed into oblivion.
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.600]  I mean, this is the global government that does medical experiments on little kids, nerve
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.720]  gases our own troops, injects black people with syphilis, totally ruthless, that's who's
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:40.720]  hijacked the country.
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:45.400]  And here's Obama, the gangster expression of it.
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:49.000]  And if you don't turn your guns in, you're not for these cute little kids.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  I mean, this is the worst, most hollow, mindless exploitation meant to manipulate women, to
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.440]  get women to be anti-gun, cuz they're panicking.
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:01.380]  The gun culture's taking over, women are out buying guns, crime rates are dropping.
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:05.200]  They've gotta hide that and point out that school shootings are going up, while everything
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.480]  else is going down, because they've been hyping the daylights out of it.
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:15.680]  Now, here is the announcement, I don't just get up here.
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:21.120]  Most websites have an IT problem, and they say we got hacked, we got this or that.
[02:13:21.120 --> 02:13:25.140]  Years ago, somebody hacked our website and posted an image of a naked woman on a motorcycle
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:27.920]  on the front page.
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:32.820]  We've had plenty of denial of service attacks coming out of China, coming out of Japan,
[02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:37.400]  but out of US military bases, they use them to basically zombie the computers to then
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:38.400]  attack us.
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:41.880]  We've had all sorts of attacks that go on, I don't talk about it.
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:46.560]  But I've had senior cyber security people who've been in government and out of government
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:47.880]  say, I don't know how you keep your side up.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:51.400]  There's been a lot of hackers out there that have also given us tips and helped us, and
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:54.520]  we're eternally thankful for that.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:57.160]  We've got some great IT people.
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:04.400]  But in the last two weeks, we've had two different dirty tricks done that are very sophisticated.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:08.160]  I'm not gonna get into what they did or what they exploited, but it's government level
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.160]  type stuff.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:15.680]  And it's very sophisticated.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:18.240]  And so we've got to basically watch the site 24 hours a day now.
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:21.360]  I'm having to hire more IT people just to watch 24 hours a day.
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:25.960]  I'm hiring an outside consulting firm to be able to deal with this.
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:29.340]  And then they went ahead to hit us with an old fashioned denial of service attack.
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:32.960]  It's undoubtedly, we are getting a lot of traffic today.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:35.440]  And traffic's much higher than it's ever been.
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:39.080]  But we were thinking early on, this is an all time record traffic, which it pretty much
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:41.560]  would be, or almost a record.
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:45.280]  But we can see, and they've got graphs in there, like I want them to get shots, that's
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:50.840]  a new report, cuz this is newsworthy, showing that it's denial of service from a whole bunch
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:56.280]  of zombie computers, government computers, hijacked university computers, you name it.
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:02.080]  The minute Obama started speaking today, about five minutes before he did when Joe Biden
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.480]  was up there is when this started, the site is up right now for now.
[02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:11.520]  And it appears they're very upset about the move to impeach Obama.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.120]  And I mean, listen, the globalists kill and assassinate people all over the world.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:18.920]  I am ready for them to kill me, okay?
[02:15:18.920 --> 02:15:22.560]  And I don't think it's gonna happen because I'm so outspoken, and my grandma's praying
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:25.760]  real hard for me, and I don't wanna die.
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:33.680]  I'll never commit suicide, but I mean, seriously, I've not made a big deal over the years about
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:36.960]  some of the other stuff that's going on, because it just sounds like a movie, and people aren't
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.960]  gonna believe it.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:41.720]  Now, other media people I've talked to, they're like, no, I know that's happened to me or
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:42.720]  that's happened to people I know.
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:46.680]  A lot of folks get intimidated like this and they just go away.
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:48.880]  All I know how to do is fight harder.
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:53.560]  I get death threats, I start doing videos at 2 AM, I mean, I start working 18, 20 hours
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.560]  a day.
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:16:02.500]  I'm like, wow, these people really are criminals, I better do something, I better work harder.
[02:16:02.500 --> 02:16:06.240]  And it's my upbringing, it's my instincts, it's just who I am.
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:10.260]  I mean, I'm not bragging about it, I'm proud of my ancestors, though they were all the
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:11.640]  same way I am.
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:17.560]  I mean, I'm probably like some of the more extreme examples, but the point is, it doesn't
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:18.560]  intimidate me.
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:21.240]  I mean, I am not afraid.
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:27.360]  I'm afraid of being a buffoon, I'm afraid of stumbling over things, I'm afraid of getting
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:28.360]  things wrong.
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:32.480]  I'm afraid of overworking and getting tired and not doing a good job.
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:37.640]  I'm afraid to look at myself in the mirror, I mean, I'm just doing the best I can, and
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:38.960]  that resonates with people.
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:46.040]  For all my warts, was it Lord Wellington, no, it was Lord Nelson said, you've gotta
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:47.680]  take me, warts and all.
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:51.720]  I know people are resonating with the fact that I'm real.
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:57.200]  And I just want you to know, this is the big thing we're doing, and they are upset.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:03.120]  Look, when they death threat us or they do sophisticated hacks, even against third parties
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:09.400]  to try to get into our system, when they call up and tell my wife or myself what we were
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:18.640]  just talking about on the phone to freak us out, like a movie, that just confirms everything,
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.640]  okay?
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.760]  And these people are criminals, and the reason they are doing denial of service attacks,
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:31.280]  the reason they are doing very complex governmental exploits, developed by French companies and
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:34.800]  others that openly only sell to governments.
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:39.800]  The fact that these are institutional attacks we're having against mfallwars.com, and whenever
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:42.800]  that site's having problems, you can go to prisonplanet.com.
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:47.360]  But make no mistake, what's happening right now is historical.
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:51.580]  And a lot of people joke and say, you're the only one dumb enough to get in this system's
[02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:52.580]  face like this.
[02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:58.040]  No, no, no, let it in, I mean, sometimes when I've been death threaded or messages
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:01.200]  are related, it's like, look, do you understand we can kill you?
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:03.720]  What you just think, I've been doing all this and I didn't know that?
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:08.540]  You think I'm like you, New World Order, most of you guys, go join the evil because you
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:09.800]  think it's the winning team.
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:13.240]  I cannot join you, okay?
[02:18:13.240 --> 02:18:19.040]  It's not even a question of, not comparing myself to one of the prophets, but things
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:20.240]  historically like this.
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:23.320]  Ezekiel, they're threatening to kill him cuz he's getting in the corrupt's faces.
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:28.860]  And he says to God, he goes, God, they're gonna kill me if I keep getting in their faces,
[02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:32.000]  but it's burning in my bones, I think that was Ezekiel.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.760]  And that's what it's like, I am not in control of myself, okay?
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:41.520]  I want everybody to understand that I cannot give up, I cannot give in, I cannot stop,
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:42.520]  okay?
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:50.000]  It is a overriding drive, and it may be ugly sometimes, but it's the best I can do, okay?
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.120]  And that's it.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:57.000]  But these fools think that dirty tricks, death threats, denial of service attacks, sophisticated
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:02.900]  hacks, all sorts of other crud, cognitive infiltration, COINTELPRO stuff's gonna get
[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:06.480]  to me, saying where I live and saying come kill me.
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.880]  All this kinda crap on the news saying, I hope his kids don't get killed, I think we
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:14.520]  should kill him, yeah, we'll do it in a uniform, ha ha ha ha.
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:22.080]  Look, I know you're a bunch of Jerry Sandusky, Jimmy Savelle wannabes, okay?
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:25.840]  And look, I'm not ever going to bow to you, you understand that?
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:30.780]  I'm never gonna shut up, I'm never gonna back down, I'm never gonna stop.
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:35.560]  And all my critics, hey, I know it's ugly sometimes, it is what it is, okay?
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:41.400]  I'm in the arena, and I'm in the arena with people like State Representative Koth.
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:45.680]  I'm in the arena with people like Ron Paul, I'm in the arena with people like Matt Drudge,
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:48.800]  I'm in the arena with people like you that want liberty.
[02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:56.200]  I'm never backing down, I signed my John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence 2012, and
[02:19:56.200 --> 02:20:00.920]  I'm never backing down, never giving in.
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:04.680]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but were waiting for an offer
[02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:09.640]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:10.640]  Here's why.
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:15.960]  Solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:20.360]  run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:23.720]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:25.400]  Now here's the best part.
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:30.080]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:35.260]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:36.260]  each year.
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:40.000]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.200]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty, and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:46.760]  Don't wait, they go fast.
[02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:50.640]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:57.200]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:07.880]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:13.720]  with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:16.920]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.
[02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:24.600]  You're on a golden stag safari for big game, but it's not Africa, it's Argentina.

[02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:07.080]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession, or at worst, depression?
[02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:09.520]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:13.800]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[02:22:13.800 --> 02:22:14.800]  is prudent.
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:18.080]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. treasuries are a safe haven.
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:23.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.840]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional
[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:28.240]  paper investments.
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:32.760]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing

[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:09.520]  is just too busy?
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:13.560]  You may be under too much stress, and it may be affecting your mind.

[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:22.680]  I just can't believe that so many people are fundamentally scared of this criminal government
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:29.560]  so then the criminal government wins and takes over.
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:31.680]  Because we act like sheep, they then win.
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.640]  Instead of acting like men, America is in a trance, man.
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:38.960]  Even people that know what's going on, you talk to them, you can't get through to them.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:43.560]  It's television watching has turned people into jellyfish.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:44.920]  Let's go to George in Texas.
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:47.560]  George, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:49.760]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:53.560]  I know there's been a buzz going around the Internet saying January 19th is going to be
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:55.920]  Gun Appreciation Day.
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:01.760]  I'm calling on the audience, let's have a Gun Owners of America membership bomb to send
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:04.640]  the message that we're not throwing down our weapons.
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:09.360]  I agree, I mean, I've said I'm not turning my guns in, I'm done.
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:10.360]  That's why I'm so upset.
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:16.120]  I've got to sit here as a law abiding person and tell the criminal government, who's exploiting
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:21.200]  dead children, you're not getting my semi-automatic rifles, you had incredible draconian gun laws
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:23.020]  in Connecticut and this happened.
[02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:26.640]  They probably staged it, they staged Fast and Furious.
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:27.640]  That's why I get so angry.
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:34.000]  Well, I'm just saying Larry Pratt has been on the fight for a long time, even when public
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.200]  opinion was against him.
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:38.280]  He has held his ground and I think he needs our support.
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:41.920]  So I'm saying January 19th, $20 a year membership bomb.
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:47.060]  Well, I agree, they've gotten a quarter million new members in the last month with the NRA.
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:50.680]  And the NRA got real milquetoast for a while because they were being infiltrated.
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:53.000]  We put pressure on them, they've gotten a lot better.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:56.840]  But yeah, Gun Owners of America, I mean, I need to ask Larry, they've gotten a lot of
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:00.160]  new members, but they should have gotten a quarter million new members.
[02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:04.520]  And we have NRA board members on and stuff like Bob Barr and stuff, I'm not knocking
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:05.520]  them.
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:06.640]  I mean, overall, they're getting better.
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:10.820]  It's just that they used to, they supported the 68 Gun Control Act that got us into this
[02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.120]  mess to begin with.
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:13.120]  Thank you so much, George.
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:14.120]  Good point.
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:16.120]  Bill in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:18.440]  Hey, Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:19.440]  Can you hear me?
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:20.440]  Yes, I can.
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:23.960]  Alex, first off, I pray for you every day.
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:25.200]  I love what you're doing.
[02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:26.600]  You've been incredible.
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:30.800]  And the night you went on Piers Morgan, I think that woke a lot of people up.
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:33.000]  And I just wanna make a quick point today.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.160]  Recently I moved from one town in North Carolina to right outside Camp Lejeune.
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.880]  And when I got here, I thought the young Marines were gonna be just sheep.
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:48.160]  And when I found out, the 19-year-olds, the 20s, the 28-year-olds, they know what's going
[02:26:48.160 --> 02:26:49.160]  on.
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.640]  They knew about Benghazi, they knew about Fast and Furious, they knew about the discrepancies
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:55.520]  in Sandy Hook, and they're gonna stand down.
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:59.520]  The ones I'm talking with, if they go in, they get told to confiscate, they're either
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:03.720]  gonna stand down, they're gonna pull out of rank, or they're not gonna show up for work.
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:07.700]  So I think one of the ways people can get on the offense is talk to your people, call
[02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:11.920]  your local sheriffs like I do, ask their opinion, find out what they're doing.
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:17.280]  Call Congressman Stockton, thank him, call Sheriff Merrill, because those guys need the
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:21.400]  prayers and they need people to support them because they're going out on a limb.
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:26.640]  And we need those guys to be a light out in the open for other representatives and other
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:30.000]  people in our legal system and sheriffs to follow.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.440]  Absolutely, I wanna get both these sheriffs, one in Kentucky, one in Washington State on,
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:37.240]  one of them wrote a letter just saying, look, what you're doing is unconstitutional, I'm
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:38.760]  not gonna be part of it.
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:43.400]  And it's gotta get to that point, but all this unconstitutional stuff, it's all out
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:45.240]  of control.
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:51.780]  And again, when I found that the FBI statistics from the locals was 21% reduction in violent
[02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:58.240]  crime generally, 49 in crimes with guns, that is the most powerful statistic.
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:01.200]  And again, I've criticized Fox News in the past, but they were showing the statistic
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:05.600]  last weekend, or late last week, and I went and looked it up and it was a statistic I
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:07.240]  hadn't seen or heard.
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:15.920]  And it was compiled from local governments, 49% drop in gun crime, 49%, I mean, and they
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.240]  want our guns and are parading and high-fying and going, you're beautiful children, the
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:25.480]  families here, you lost your beautiful children, like a vampire using the deaths of those kids.
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:28.760]  I mean, did it make you nauseated to watch that press conference?
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:34.200]  Alex, disgusting, I was sitting here chomping at the bit, I'm listening to and to exploit
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:40.240]  those children, it's a psyop, it's disgusting, because we know, those of us who are awake
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:46.240]  and those of us who have prior military experience know exactly what he's doing and why he's
[02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:50.040]  doing it, and it's just disgusting to watch.
[02:28:50.040 --> 02:28:54.800]  And one other thing too that I'm seeing too is the hypocrisy, a lot of times when I'm
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:58.920]  talking to the liberals out there, it's a matter of their opinion, it's like, look guys,
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:03.360]  it's not about your opinion, these are the impeachable offenses, you're Benghazi, you're
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:07.560]  Fast and Furious, you're Sandy Hooks, so what you were able to put down in those article
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:11.960]  impeachments, I'm able to get out to Facebook and share that with my friends and family
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:17.440]  because it's not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of constitutional doctrine.
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:22.560]  So keep it up, Alex, I love you, I pray for you and your staff, my brother, keep on keeping
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:23.560]  on, brother.
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:30.520]  Thank you, my friend as well, and again folks, if they were real dummies that wanted guns
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:36.960]  to keep us safe, it wouldn't be as bad, these are mobster gangster crooks that suckered
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:41.480]  their own people and said we're not going to raise your taxes and then massively hammered
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:46.240]  them, and then almost all the working poor are going down to 29 hours from 40 or 50,
[02:29:46.240 --> 02:29:50.280]  I mean, it's so mean.
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:30:01.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:06.160]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:10.760]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:12.600]  by a disastrous economy?
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:15.320]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:19.120]  At E Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:26.600]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:31.440]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:32.440]  and niece.
[02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:36.240]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:35.960]  It is really hard to do this radio show because really what I want to be doing is going back
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:39.920]  and getting all their statements and video clips and press conferences where they say
[02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:40.920]  what their plan is.
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:45.560]  And then I can show you, I say 11 or 12 bills, it's like 20 something now they've introduced
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:49.820]  in Congress, but they're all incredibly nasty.
[02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:52.920]  And so no one even knows what the plan is now.
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:57.960]  It's just, hey, I'm up here with kids high-fying, any more kids get killed, it's you gun owners,
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:02.320]  it's your fault if you don't do what I want, I'm the good guy.
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:04.160]  And it's just such a mindless psyop.
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:08.520]  It's like saying, turn your cars in or the next time there's a car wreck, it's your fault.
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:12.080]  I mean, it is just, yeah, let's get some audio while he's high-fying.
[02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:18.040]  I mean, exploiting those little sweetie pies, man, I tell you, people used to show me photos
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.440]  of their kids when I was young and I'd be like, why are you showing me photos of your
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:22.440]  kids?
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:25.360]  Now I've got children, people want to show me their wallet full of pictures, I want to
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:26.360]  see it.
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:27.360]  You know what I mean?
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:31.280]  I just, it makes me sick whenever people use kids for something.
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:37.520]  I just love children so much because their little minds ready to be filled with information
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:39.560]  and for the adventure of life.
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:45.400]  And then I think of people like Sandusky and Saville and these globalist scum and the things
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:49.480]  they do to children and it makes me sick.
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:54.320]  It makes me sick, it's like people that want to hurt innocent animals like dogs and cats.
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:57.820]  I mean, you read about people that it's like some fetish where good looking women beat
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:00.280]  animals to death, some kind of snuff porn.
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:06.920]  I mean, it's little puppies, kids, but kids, it's like 10 times more angering than puppies.
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:08.720]  It's like, who are these people?
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:14.800]  And they're always, these perverts and pedophiles and government types are always real fake
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:19.920]  and psychopathic and come off like nice guys, but you can see it in their eyes and in their
[02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:20.980]  actions.
[02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:25.560]  And when Obama talks about those beautiful children that got killed, they always call
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:26.560]  them beautiful.
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:31.120]  I mean, what a pervert, man, okay, I'm going too far what I really think about Obama.
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:34.400]  That guy is a demonic pervert.
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:37.920]  He wants to pervert our Constitution, he wants to pervert our republic.
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.880]  He wants to be a Peace Prize winner and launch all these illegal wars.
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:46.800]  And the left is just all sick and gets into the death and destruction and all of it.
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:52.320]  I mean, I'm just sick of them.
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:57.120]  And Joe Biden is such a gangster.
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:01.000]  And Rahm Emanuel looks like a cartoon character gangster.
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.040]  I mean, did you see him in that press conference yesterday, sweating and looking all nuts?
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:10.640]  I mean, that guy is crazy.
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:14.480]  And you've got all these like San Francisco and New York saying how big your Coca-Cola
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:17.720]  can be, how big your apartment can be now.
[02:36:17.720 --> 02:36:22.240]  I mean, just a bunch of control freaks, they just wanna run everybody's lives.
[02:36:22.240 --> 02:36:27.160]  They want everybody living in fear, not need of stuff that statistically isn't a threat.
[02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:31.480]  If my kids went to public school, I'd be worried about them being beat up by bullies, turning
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:37.560]  into mindless TV heads, turning into emotional wrecks cuz a bunch of mean kids telling them
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:44.000]  they're not cool, instead of their minds being filled with science and sports and discovery.
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.400]  I'd be scared of the state pushing drugs on them.
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:48.600]  I'd be scared of stuff like that.
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:53.080]  I wouldn't be scared if my kids went to public school of a mass shooting.
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:59.200]  88 people die a year, and last year was a record year.
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:03.080]  All the other crimes dropping but those, cuz the media advertises it, of a Sikh temple,
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:09.320]  a movie theater, a couple schools, 88 people dead.
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:14.880]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't even register in the top 100 causes of death.
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:19.240]  But they've got people thinking, I mean, I got news reports pouring out where people
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:22.840]  see a kid with a Nerf gun in their front yard that sold at Target and Walmart.
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:26.360]  My kids have probably had ten of them over the years cuz they break so easy, and we were
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:27.360]  having a Nerf battle this weekend.
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:31.080]  I mean, you drive through any suburban neighborhood, it's Nerf war.
[02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:33.860]  Your car gets shot with Nerf darts.
[02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:35.360]  Your car gets hit with footballs.
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:41.920]  I mean, people now see orange and yellow and green Nerf guns, and the police are called
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:44.880]  and they lock down the area and play along with it.
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:51.520]  I mean, it is just sick how they are turning us into a bunch of cowards.
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:55.080]  And believe me, everything Obama said in that press conference is a target.
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:57.720]  There it is, Nerf gun found after Long Island school lockdown.
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:00.960]  I mean, there's a bunch of these happening.
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:05.040]  That whole speech was targeting shocker moms about, here's the sweet kids, we don't want
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:06.120]  them to get killed.
[02:38:06.120 --> 02:38:11.440]  I got some reasonable stuff I'm gonna be announcing, goodbye, goodbye, high five, high five.
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:16.320]  I got an Obamacare, there's no death panels, no, it doesn't increase your premiums.
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:20.800]  That's a right wing lie, blah, blah, more like, here it is, here it is.
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:21.800]  It's in a bill.
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.320]  But see, they never say it in press conferences.
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:29.840]  So I have to sit here, that's why I'm getting so angry, is this is like Groundhog Day.
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:38.800]  You ever seen that great movie, Groundhog Day, with Bill Murray?
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:43.520]  And he just, I mean, it's the same day over and over again.
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:46.040]  No matter what he does, he has to relive this day over and over again.
[02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:53.000]  And I have to watch people get conned and bamboozled and manipulated and snookered and
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  conned over and over and over again.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.320]  And I know exactly what they're doing, and I'm not even smart.
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:02.200]  I mean, that was an incredibly exploitive press conference.
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:10.120]  Biden was trying to hold back a smile the entire time, was literally having a you know
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:12.280]  what dream up there.
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:16.200]  Obama was trying to act somber and look like the devil.
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:21.160]  All right, I'm gonna stop.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:23.240]  Andy in Africa, I didn't know somebody was calling from Africa.
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:26.080]  Where are you calling us from Africa?
[02:39:26.080 --> 02:39:28.040]  I'm calling from Africa, Alex.
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:29.400]  Welcome, you're on the air.
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:32.720]  Where are you calling from in Africa?
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:35.400]  The good part, the southern part.
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:36.400]  South Africa?
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:39.080]  That's it, that's right, Alex.
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:42.700]  To start out, I just wanna say thanks for making people aware of some of the really
[02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:44.440]  important issues like gun control.
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:48.160]  I really like how you've upgraded the show, and hello to all the listeners out there.
[02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:50.040]  May Yahushua bless you all.
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:51.240]  Well, thank you.
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:53.160]  How do we upgrade the show?
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:56.800]  Okay, no, just the new graphics and the TV.
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:00.440]  I've watched your show for about, I've seen your show, I wouldn't listen to it for about
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:01.920]  five, six, seven years now.
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:02.920]  So it's looking good.
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:08.400]  We're gonna keep upgrading, but I gotta say, CJ and Chris are just upping their game.
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:13.720]  John Bound, the hardest place to work is in here with me, cuz I get in a rampage, and
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:15.080]  so I pray for them as well.
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:16.520]  They're doing overall a great job.
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:18.680]  They really upped their game, so we're thankful for that.
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:20.400]  Go ahead, sir, I'll shut up.
[02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:22.240]  No worries, no worries, no worries.
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:24.520]  You mentioned your web servers have been going down.
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:26.760]  Well, you're not the only one, so to speak.
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.520]  I am a web developer and researcher, and I'm here to tell you that the Illuminati is back
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:32.520]  online.
[02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:33.520]  Breaking news.
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:35.940]  Now, what do I mean by that?
[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:39.320]  You remember the Illuminati card game, right?
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:40.320]  Yes.
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:46.160]  Okay, interesting thing is this card game started out as an online game, okay?
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:51.520]  Running on what we would call an Illuminati server, I guess, which was a DDS system.
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:56.600]  So the game started on a server, and then Steve Jackson's games was raided by the Secret
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:01.040]  Service, and they confiscated the server and the data that was on that server.
[02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:05.520]  The game was never supposed to get out, according to Stephen Dolan's said to be an ex-Satanist
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:07.840]  anti-priest, who exposed the game in the Prophets of God.
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:13.440]  By the way, the maker of the Illuminati card game and the video game developer, he has
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:16.000]  his offices about two miles from us.
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:19.080]  We've called him, no exaggeration, probably 40 times.
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:22.920]  I keep saying when we get time, we're gonna go over there.
[02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:26.760]  And also, in the past, I know where he lived, cuz my parents lived close to him in North
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:30.280]  Austin, and he'd have these weird Halloween parties where he'd let all the neighborhood
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:32.240]  kids in, run through his castle house.
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:34.800]  I never went over there, but I read about it in the paper.
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:39.560]  Back when I was in high school, actually, we're talking about like in 1992, yeah, his
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:41.800]  card game predicts everything.
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:43.600]  And I don't know how they did it.
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:44.600]  It's bizarre.
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.720]  Well, that's pretty interesting, cuz possibly Stephen Dolan's had insider knowledge being
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:50.720]  a Satanist anti-priest.
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:55.520]  So anyhow, Steve Jackson's games, this is where it gets really interesting, Alex.
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:01.720]  Steve Jackson games, PrismNet, used to own a domain called io.com, and that's Illuminati
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:02.720]  Online.
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:07.720]  Now, this domain name actually led to the creation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:12.400]  according to Flashdot.com, and they got their servers back, which they probably weren't
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:17.520]  supposed to, and the big part of the hacker movement actually is the EFF, Electronic Frontier
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:18.520]  Foundation.
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:19.520]  Perhaps they could help you guys out.
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:27.440]  In any case, July 1st, 2011, Richards & Richards sold the domain to an unnamed party, okay?
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:33.000]  Now io.com is being sold, and it seems perhaps the Illuminati is back online in a big way
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.960]  cuz io.com now points to io data centers.
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:41.960]  Get this, io is Goldman Sachs' worldwide vendor of choice for advanced data storage.
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:45.080]  Listen, what you gotta do is you wanna shoot a YouTube video about this, you wanna write
[02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:49.040]  an article about this, because it's complex, I'm not following it all.
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:53.080]  Plus, I don't know if this video game maker is a devil high priest, cuz somebody said
[02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:54.080]  so.
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:42:58.560]  I'm a devil high priest, or a ninja warlock, cuz we joked about it once, they actually
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:03.920]  think that's real now, that I'm a Vatican assassin ninja warlock, I mean, it's a joke.
[02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:07.680]  But yeah, they have some deep knowledge about things for that card game.
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:12.480]  But I mean, then people go too far, there's one card, looks like myself and Ron Paul in
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:15.360]  it, and so that's proof that we're part of it.
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:21.280]  I mean, but it is bizarre, I mean, cuz I've collected now, well, I haven't collected,
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:25.400]  listeners have meld us the entire set, which is pretty rare, I think it's three or four
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:26.400]  sets.
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:29.960]  And you look at this, and it was made like 20 years ago, and you're like, how did they
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:30.960]  do this?
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:31.960]  How did they predict all this?
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:38.160]  The tower's getting blown up, the Pentagon hit just like it got hit, staging terror,
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:43.360]  COINTELPRO, I mean, it's just, wow, this guy really knew what he was talking about, but
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:45.760]  he won't come on the show.
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:48.960]  And so it's becoming an issue, thank you so much, I gotta move quick here now.
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:53.080]  I wanna play some of these clips of Obama that David Knight worked to clip out from
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:55.040]  the disgusting press conference.
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:57.400]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:02.880]  Well, Gun Appreciation Day, that'd be January 19th, as the last previous caller mentioned,
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:07.720]  that was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 84th birthday.
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.040]  And we- By the way, he went and got a concealed carry
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:12.040]  permit.
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:14.640]  He went and was trying to get a gun permit right before they killed him.
[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:19.440]  Absolutely, and the deacons of defense who provided security for him from the KKK and
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:23.920]  other government-sponsored race-baitors, but we need to demand an apology from our government.
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:29.920]  Of course, you know about the 1999 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. family's court case at the
[02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:35.520]  kingcenter.org, a unanimous jury decision that his assassination was a conspiracy by
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:43.320]  state, local, and federal officials, and this was after expert testimony, 70 witnesses,
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:49.560]  and a civil trial in Memphis, Tennessee, unanimous decision on December 8th, 1999, after about
[02:44:49.560 --> 02:44:51.560]  an hour of deliberation.
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:58.040]  So that's one point I wanna mention, and also the FDA has their adverse event reporting
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:03.440]  system on 31 drugs that are disproportionately linked to the reports of violent behavior
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:04.440]  towards others.
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:08.840]  Now, we have a two-year-old Time magazine article that lists the top 10, it's entitled
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:14.040]  Top 10 Illegal Drugs Linked to Violence, and four of which are fluorinated.
[02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.840]  That'd be Prozac, Luvox, Effexor, and Paxil.
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:23.560]  Next, I would like to also mention that Cheers Morgan is in violation, subject to life sentence
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:28.920]  or death penalty, for the death threat against you, Alex, Title 18, Section 241 and 242.
[02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:34.360]  That would also include those co-conspirators on the air, Buzz Buzzinger, sports columnist
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:39.680]  for the Daily Beef, and Abby Huntsman of the Huffington Post, they have not redacted their
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:44.560]  conspiracy against you, Alex, and that's something that ought to be harped on.
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:48.840]  Joyce Riley showed this morning, was also very good on the Hensah-Neewick Elementary
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:52.720]  School shooting, she spent two hours with a private investigator, so check out the Power
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:55.600]  Hour, and that's a lot of awesome research.
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:59.720]  All right, buddy, I really appreciate your call, that's a lot of info, boy, my head wasn't
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:01.080]  spinning it is now.
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:06.800]  Here's the breaking news, document cam, please, now is the time, the President's plan to protect
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:10.160]  our children and our communities by reducing gun violence.
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:14.840]  And Aaron Dykes, since this came out about 30 minutes ago, he and David Knight, both
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:19.920]  crack researchers, have gone over it and indexed it, it is exactly what they already claimed
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:22.280]  they were going to do.
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:26.680]  It has created total gun hysteria, tie it to insurance, to get insurance you'll have
[02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:31.900]  to have police brainwashing, active shooter drills, but never wear your arm to protect
[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:38.080]  yourself to teach you how to go lay in a corner so the executioner can kill you a little bit
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:39.080]  more easily.
[02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:44.080]  The BBC has called my phone, no exaggeration, 30, 40 times a day, I'm gonna take this right
[02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:45.080]  now.
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:48.080]  Hello, is this the BBC?
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:52.840]  ITV, that's out of Canada, right?
[02:46:52.840 --> 02:46:58.480]  Ma'am, ma'am, I lost my phone and I never put the voicemail back on it, just do me a
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:46:59.480]  favor.
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:02.880]  I'm gonna be off the air in about 15 minutes or so, why don't you text this?
[02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:08.240]  Yeah, exactly, just text this number, your name and number and I or somebody will get
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:11.360]  back with you, okay?
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:19.400]  Thank you, this rings nonstop at every TV station you can imagine, I should be doing
[02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:23.160]  all these interviews, but I'm just too burnt out, man.
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:27.080]  And another thing is I get on these TV shows, I just wanna blow up at them, cuz I know we
[02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:32.780]  got mafia running things, people are in a trance, and the whole system wants us to just
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:35.280]  play along and just be real calm about it.
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:40.480]  And then we need to be calm, no, the time for being calm is over, we got into this situation
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:41.480]  by being calm.
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:45.820]  I've intellectually been calm, I've analyzed the data, these people are criminals, I'm
[02:47:45.820 --> 02:47:48.820]  done with them.
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:54.240]  Excuse me, now the irritating thing is I was doing radio interviews driving in this morning
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:58.040]  and TV stations would not stop calling it where I couldn't even do the radio interviews.
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:07.360]  In fact, I was on our 50,000 watt KMJ and they literally, literally called 15 times
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:10.760]  while I was on that 10 minute interview where the interview was worthless.
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:13.860]  My wife's like, well, you gotta put the do not disturb on here, which I don't remember
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:17.200]  to do, I'm not complaining on air, I didn't answer the phone to act powerful.
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:24.000]  I'm just angry about this cuz they've been calling, see I'm angry, I shouldn't have guns,
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:25.280]  I'm angry, I'm angry.
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:28.200]  You wouldn't have a country if your forebearers weren't angry.
[02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:31.760]  By the way, the reason we've had so much wealth, we haven't been perfect, we've been at our
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:32.760]  own problems.
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:36.620]  The reason we've had so much wealth is because we didn't let thugs get in control of us and
[02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:41.500]  turn us into the other slaves, okay?
[02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:45.520]  Our ancestors wouldn't put up with anybody's garbage and so there was a lot of private
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:50.480]  independent operators and a free market got developed and we all got super rich.
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.360]  Now we've gotten super decadent, we got taken over, now we're gonna get super poor again.
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:49:00.500]  Because despots make everybody poor on purpose, plus they screw everything up, but they don't
[02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:02.600]  care cuz they got theirs.
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:12.200]  Anyways, they have analyzed it and it is used the healthcare law to force everybody to pay
[02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:14.400]  for anti-gun training and anti-gun brainwashing.
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:18.760]  So it's gonna be an anti-gun tax in Obamacare, cuz Obamacare is written where they can do
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:20.320]  whatever they want.
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:26.840]  That's probably the biggest thing here, turn the doctors into spies, have a national demonization
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:32.880]  campaign run by Holder, national dialogue, talking about just putting people on lists
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:39.760]  without any proof that they can't own guns, banning all private sales, physically banning
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.800]  semi-autos and handguns if they can get it legislatively.
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:48.720]  Arresting anybody that sells a gun to a neighbor, claiming all your guns retroactively to prove
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:50.280]  where you got them.
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:55.320]  They want you to have to come in and re-register them, active shooter training everywhere to
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:49:57.480]  create more hype about mass shooting.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:00.880]  So all these mentally ill people just get told about mass shooting and shown how to
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:01.880]  do it all day.
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:05.280]  It's like the DARE program, it proved, made kids use more drugs.
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:10.160]  It's like sex ed, I remember sitting there in seventh grader in sex ed, and they're sitting
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:13.520]  there talking about sex and I'm looking over at the cheerleader next to me, and she's looking
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:14.520]  over at me.
[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:18.400]  Just like, I think the point is it makes everybody go have sex, folks.
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:22.120]  Well, it's the same thing here, you gotta tell the mentally ill people, hey, you wanna
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:23.120]  go out with a bang?
[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:25.560]  Go to a school, shoot some people.
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:30.040]  Model emergency response, FEMA involved, they want churches, campuses, everything to be
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:31.040]  brainwashed.
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:37.240]  They're gonna try to force gun manufacturers to put biometrics on all the guns.
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:42.160]  They want high school resource anti-gun brainwashing officers who aren't armed.
[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:45.880]  But if they are to be armed, they're gonna be federal people in the schools turning into
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:49.800]  a prison and a tattletale squad.
[02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:53.340]  And this is how they totally, just like they converted the airports into police state zones
[02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:55.600]  off of some staged events, they're doing the same thing here.
[02:50:55.600 --> 02:51:01.200]  All right, we'll be back with more of your calls, stay with us.
[02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:04.920]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:09.960]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:10.960]  Here's why.
[02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:13.960]  Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power.
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:19.600]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:20.600]  from the sun.
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:24.040]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:29.320]  Now here's the best part, every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't
[02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:30.320]  sell as new.
[02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:35.520]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of
[02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:36.520]  each year.
[02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:40.260]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:45.480]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[02:51:45.480 --> 02:51:47.000]  Don't wait, they go fast.
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:50.880]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:57.240]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:03.480]  Hi there, my name is Frank Bates.
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:07.160]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:52:07.160 --> 02:52:13.400]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:18.160]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:23.280]  are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:27.280]  Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up and you will be
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:31.160]  shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:36.820]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:39.240]  and how you can beat them too.
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:43.000]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:44.720]  in the last three months.
[02:52:44.720 --> 02:52:50.080]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:51.080]  your home.
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:57.240]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:52:57.240 --> 02:52:59.240]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:05.920]  Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older
[02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:06.920]  one gets.
[02:53:06.920 --> 02:53:10.560]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:16.200]  gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition.
[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:20.420]  If the Hanza men can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone in North
[02:53:20.420 --> 02:53:23.460]  America to experience a more youthful life as well.
[02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:27.640]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality
[02:53:27.640 --> 02:53:29.080]  of protein consumed.
[02:53:29.080 --> 02:53:33.520]  All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged, destroying 50 to
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:38.220]  75% of your ability to utilize the bodybuilding amino acids.
[02:53:38.220 --> 02:53:43.940]  One World Way is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids.
[02:53:43.940 --> 02:53:46.320]  This feat no one else has achieved.
[02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:49.200]  The results to your health can be amazing.
[02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:51.740]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:54.520]  That's 888-988-3325.
[02:53:54.520 --> 02:53:56.840]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:56.840 --> 02:54:20.160]  That's OneWorldWay.com Listen, I've got to go over the Obama speech.
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:21.160]  We've got all the clips.
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:25.000]  We're going to go into overdrive here today and we've got all these callers that are holding
[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.760]  like Mike in Texas and so many others.
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:30.760]  And we will take a ton of your calls in the next hour.
[02:54:30.760 --> 02:54:34.760]  And of course, Infowars Nightly News tonight is going to have my good friend and gun dealer
[02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:39.740]  and New American Magazine researcher and writer Bob Dacy is going to be here analyzing it.
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:42.320]  This is all about the UN treaty coming up.
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:44.560]  And Aaron Dykes was just showing me more.
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:46.200]  It's really bad.
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:50.080]  They're going to just have Health and Human Services.
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:53.280]  If you're handicapped, you're not going to be able to have a gun.
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:57.320]  And what I just read, and it's directly from Health and Human Services, it's why it's hard
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:00.600]  to do the show right now because I'm out there reading stuff during the breaks and then it's
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:01.600]  just overwhelming.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:06.760]  It looks like they're going to try to take handicapped people's weapons, not even mentally
[02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:07.760]  handicapped.
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:10.640]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:11.640]  It's unbelievable.
[02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:16.200]  And then they're just going to pick and choose gun owners to come harass and SWAT team and
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:17.200]  stuff.
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:22.400]  And then just have a huge unending brainwashing campaign like the Attorney General said against
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:23.400]  Republicans.
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:27.480]  All I know is we've got to get aggressive, have national days where we have our guns
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:28.480]  out in public.
[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:32.640]  They hate that because they like to have TV act like guns are already illegal.
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:36.960]  We've been fighting back and we've got good sheriffs, good police that are servants that
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:40.360]  by the way, I noticed her dressed like police and not army commandos.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:46.760]  You can always see the good cops are dressed like dignified public servants and not like
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:47.760]  goons.
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:53.240]  But side issue, I was on Porter Stansbury's radio show this morning and he lives in Miami
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:56.880]  during the winter.
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:55:58.880]  Not a bad idea, beautiful.
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:03.080]  And my allergies are so bad from the cedar during the winter.
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:06.640]  I'm thinking about going to Miami or something for three months out of the year and remoting
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:08.880]  into the office because of these cedar allergies.
[02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:13.320]  But the point is that he said, yeah, I really like the cops around here.
[02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:17.240]  They dress in just nice conservative outfits, they're real nice.
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:21.560]  He goes, I came down now, they're like Darth Vader cars, Darth Vader outfits.
[02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:25.340]  They pull over families and get their shotguns out when they walk up.
[02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:28.280]  And he doesn't even know if he wants to stay there anymore.
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:30.680]  I mean, it's just, that's one thing I got to say for R.D.
[02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:31.680]  Cevita.
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:35.660]  He's trying to put the police back in old fashioned police uniforms and old fashioned
[02:56:35.660 --> 02:56:39.200]  police cars and have them act like old fashioned cops.
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:45.640]  I mean, can't we just have that, do we have to have people playing Rambo all day and then
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:47.280]  acting like we're the enemy?
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:49.040]  A military fights an enemy.
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:52.200]  I don't want my police to look like a military.
[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:57.280]  I want my military to look like a military, and I don't want my military operating domestically.
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:01.840]  But support the broadcast, get the Propure water filters, 10% off the promo code water.

[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:36.960]  off short.

[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:54.360]  Again, my head is spinning right now.
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:57.720]  Aaron Dykes and the entire team are in there.
[02:57:57.720 --> 02:58:03.920]  Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Don Salazar, Kurt Nemo, Mike Adams is basically an unofficial
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:06.780]  member of the team, hammering through this.
[02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:12.520]  And it's all nebulous, but we got them because with each thing they've called for nebulous,
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:17.160]  we have previous policy and bills they've introduced by the very people on this board
[02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:20.680]  in some cases, we know their attack profile.
[02:58:20.680 --> 02:58:26.800]  You already know what it is, register, confiscate, shut down ammo manufacturers, harass gun dealers,
[02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:32.720]  harass gun manufacturers, sue gun manufacturers, ban importation, put you on no buy list with
[02:58:32.720 --> 02:58:38.800]  no proof for no reason, SWAT team and harass gun owners, demonize gun ownership everywhere,
[02:58:38.800 --> 02:58:39.800]  unbelievable.

[02:59:55.760 --> 03:00:05.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:10.600]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:11.600]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.600 --> 03:00:13.720]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.720 --> 03:00:17.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.920 --> 03:00:26.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:30.360]  Folks, if you go up to infoawards.com, it's been up and down today under a coordinated
[03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:34.240]  denial of service attack, the biggest we've ever seen.
[03:00:34.240 --> 03:00:35.240]  Does it matter?
[03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:37.280]  We'll just start even more backup websites.
[03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:40.800]  Our listeners will just get the impeachment articles out to even more people, get them
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:42.600]  out to every member of Congress.
[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:45.760]  I'll talk about it after we take calls and I got some clips of the president we're going
[03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:46.840]  to analyze coming up here.
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:51.000]  But it's the same thing with Obamacare, left it nebulous, and now he's just going to do
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:54.160]  whatever he wants.
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:55.720]  And they are licking their chops.
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:01:01.000]  I mean, they know there's going to be another mass shooting with all this media hype, guaranteed.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:02.640]  And it's just a matter of time.
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:04.080]  And if they're in, they'll stage one.
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:07.920]  And like Larry Pratt said, you notice the media won't attack Larry Pratt for that.
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:09.560]  They tried and dropped it.
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:13.800]  Remember Larry Pratt after Aurora, he said on my show and others, and it made national
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:18.040]  news, but then they backed off, Larry Pratt says the government could have staged this.
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.280]  What he said was if they staged Fast and Furious, they could have staged this.
[03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:23.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're the prime suspects.
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:27.360]  And then each event has so many earmarks.
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:32.600]  It'd be like if you were a cop and you're driving by a bank and you see guys running
[03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:37.360]  out with masks on and bags over their shoulders and guns in their belts.
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:42.720]  I mean, that's probable cause, they're bank robbers.
[03:01:42.720 --> 03:01:46.240]  I mean, if they don't stop, you can shoot them.
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:49.560]  I mean, it's the same deal.
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:53.720]  I mean, they have done this stuff before, they stand to gain from it.
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:58.360]  And all the anomalies and the things involved, I don't just say this because I want to think
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:00.520]  this, it's overwhelming.
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:06.800]  And I haven't even been touching it a lot, people are mad at me.
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:08.560]  Because people are like, yeah, this is blaringly staged.
[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:11.800]  Yeah, of course it's staged, of course it's staged.
[03:02:11.800 --> 03:02:15.200]  There's some real mass school shootings, but these things, you get a mental patient in
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:16.200]  there, you shoot them.
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:18.120]  You have organized crime, shoot some kids.
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:19.120]  They get out.
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:23.200]  Even if they get caught, the feds say, let them go, and then you just change the story
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:24.200]  around.
[03:02:24.200 --> 03:02:26.560]  And I haven't even gotten into homes.
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:28.000]  I mean, that is incredible.
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.400]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:32.000]  Guns and Obama, you're on the air.
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Go ahead.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:38.720]  Hey, Alex, my family and I are praying for you, you're doing the yeoman's job there.
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:42.640]  I hope that nothing happens.
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:44.000]  I hope everything stays peaceful.
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:48.320]  Well, listen, I only whine about it and I've gotten my will redone and stuff, because there
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:50.560]  is a chance they may set me up or do something.
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:52.680]  I'm just letting people know this is real.
[03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:57.600]  I'm not putting it out there, ooh, the show's spooky, and oh man, I mean, these are criminals.
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:01.420]  And a lot of people aren't fighting them because they know they're criminals.
[03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:03.680]  And I'm just saying, let's just get this out in the open.
[03:03:03.680 --> 03:03:05.320]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:10.800]  Well, you know, we are the cops out in front of the bank, and these guys are the robbers.
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:15.480]  They just ran out, they got the masks on, they got the guns, and they're saying, hey,
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:19.400]  you know, we'll just go ahead and gaslight these people and say, hey, turn over your
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:20.400]  guns.
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:24.080]  You can't get us, we just robbed the bank, you can't do anything about it.
[03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:29.720]  But the one thing I called in about is, you know, Obama sounds real reasonable to the
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:36.680]  soccer moms and to everybody that wants to obey the law and has empathy for the parents
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:39.880]  and the children that were killed and all of that.
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:42.280]  Everything he says is real reasonable.
[03:03:42.280 --> 03:03:49.280]  The only problem is, you know, he works for us, and he wants a background check so that
[03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:50.860]  we can have our guns.
[03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:54.760]  What about, he's working for us, we need a background check on him.
[03:03:54.760 --> 03:03:57.720]  He has access to weapons of mass destruction.
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:00.880]  He has access to predator drones.
[03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:05.240]  Exactly, he won't release any of his college records, he won't release any of it.
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:07.280]  He's got multiple names on record.
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:10.320]  He's in college magazines under other names.
[03:04:10.320 --> 03:04:12.020]  We don't know who this guy is.
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:13.840]  For all I know, he could be a robot.
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:17.740]  I mean, I'm joking when I say that, but I mean, he is Mr. Mystery.
[03:04:17.740 --> 03:04:19.560]  That's why more and more I'm getting freaked out by him.
[03:04:19.560 --> 03:04:24.240]  I mean, I, man, I tell you, we're in trouble, that's all I can tell you.
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:25.920]  Yeah, why are we putting up with this?
[03:04:25.920 --> 03:04:30.720]  I mean, you know, this is the thing that should be put out there.
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:35.880]  You know, he's never gone through a background check here, you know?
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:36.880]  We know he's bad.
[03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:37.880]  No, it's true.
[03:04:37.880 --> 03:04:41.240]  In fact, they've had news articles saying, to work at the post office, you'd have to
[03:04:41.240 --> 03:04:44.280]  have more of a background check than Obama's had.
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:48.760]  And that's why they've got him in there, is because who knows who he really is?
[03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:53.000]  Barry Sotero, who knows who his dad really is?
[03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:57.840]  All these other names, he's got at least three different names that have been his name on
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:04:58.840]  record.
[03:04:58.840 --> 03:04:59.840]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.840 --> 03:05:07.680]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[03:05:07.680 --> 03:05:12.920]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every

[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:41.640]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

[03:05:50.560 --> 03:05:53.000]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:54.840]  It's an info war.
[03:05:54.840 --> 03:06:02.560]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:31.560]  All right, it's official, we're trying to get the full text of all of them, we're live
[03:08:31.560 --> 03:08:34.720]  here at 208 Central.
[03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:41.520]  Obama signs 23 executive orders to curb gun violence, urges Congress to act.
[03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:46.120]  And we're gonna be going over all of this and playing some of the clips and then going
[03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:47.120]  back to your phone calls.
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:54.480]  The latest is all up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, we'll have a lot more tonight, 7 o'clock
[03:08:54.480 --> 03:09:03.440]  Central for the Infowars Nightly News at infowarsnews.com.
[03:09:03.440 --> 03:09:07.840]  Now if you go up to infowars.com, it's scrolled down to the bottom of the featured news area,
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:11.800]  it's citizens file articles of impeachment against Obama.
[03:09:11.800 --> 03:09:16.000]  And again, most people get it, some are saying, well, how do you file that?
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:21.120]  I'm publicly putting out with links to the lawyers and congressmen and women's statements
[03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:26.600]  and with the text of the Constitution where Obama is clearly violating Article I, Section
[03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:27.600]  9.
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:32.440]  And I just go on and on and on, showing all the high crimes and misdemeanors and what
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:33.840]  Congress is to do.
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:38.720]  And I think I'll go in there and add some statements as well and show some more of the
[03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:39.720]  Constitution at the bottom of the article.
[03:09:39.720 --> 03:09:45.040]  Then I have a video breaking it down there, but citizens file articles of impeachment
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:46.280]  against Obama.
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:49.240]  Where you really wanna go is drudgereport.com, that's where I go.
[03:09:49.240 --> 03:09:55.760]  And if you go there, it's got all the latest too, as it's breaking, but the ammo shortages
[03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:58.480]  are so bad cuz of citizens buying ammo.
[03:09:58.480 --> 03:10:02.240]  And now you know Homeland Security bought 1.6 billion bullets, more than they'd use
[03:10:02.240 --> 03:10:05.600]  for target practice in a decade, that's 1.6 billion bullets.
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:10.560]  That's enough bullets to shoot every person in America more than four times.
[03:10:10.560 --> 03:10:17.480]  Hollow points, 223, 308, hollow point 40, they did all this because they knew this was
[03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:18.480]  coming.
[03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:22.320]  And Obama's on record, that's the thing I get so mad about.
[03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:26.960]  They all admit they've always wanted total abolition of our guns, the UN treaty pushes
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:27.960]  that.
[03:10:27.960 --> 03:10:34.100]  The abolition of civilian ownership of firearms, because civilian ownership of firearms threatens
[03:10:34.100 --> 03:10:36.820]  the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[03:10:36.820 --> 03:10:43.720]  That's a quote from Unideer and the treaty in July 7th, 2001.
[03:10:43.720 --> 03:10:46.520]  And it's the same treaty today, they just added to it.
[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:52.340]  This is their goal, don't say it's about the dead kids, it's about domination.
[03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:55.120]  Because every country where they take the guns, the cops are running around in black
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:11:00.280]  masks with machine guns and torturing people and arresting everybody in giant prisons,
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:01.280]  okay?
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:04.040]  We know what this is about.
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:06.800]  Let's start going to some of these clips, and we'll have more of these on the nightly
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:07.800]  news tonight.
[03:11:07.800 --> 03:11:10.960]  Jacari Jax is doing it, but undoubtedly I'll do some special reports as well.
[03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:15.000]  Cuz as soon as the broadcast is over, I'm gonna put my head in all this and come up
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  with some statements.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:20.120]  It's exactly what we thought, but even bigger, they're gonna swarm us with our own tax money
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:22.220]  to take our guns at every level.
[03:11:22.220 --> 03:11:29.000]  They're gonna make the entire homeland security hysteria and fear about guns.
[03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:33.320]  They're trying to kill the gun culture, and I got news for you, it's gonna backfire.
[03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:37.260]  Currently, there's gonna be more mass shootings, though.
[03:11:37.260 --> 03:11:40.800]  That's why they're so confident, they've got something really nasty planned.
[03:11:40.800 --> 03:11:45.560]  Like Fast and Furious was when the Second Amendment, thousands of dead Mexicans conservatively,
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:49.020]  hundreds of dead Americans conservatively, five dead law enforcement conservatively on
[03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:51.760]  our side, hundreds on their side.
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:58.400]  Thousands of citizens, civilians, as we're called, these are cold-blooded mafia dons.
[03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:03.640]  I mean, Obama admits he signs death orders, what is it, every Tuesday for hundreds of
[03:12:03.640 --> 03:12:08.380]  drone strikes, because it's okay when he does, even though it violates international law.
[03:12:08.380 --> 03:12:11.920]  In all these countries we're not even at war with, that Congress hasn't authorized, and
[03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:16.280]  they'll blow up an entire apartment building to get one bad guy, they say.
[03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:19.000]  And it's like, well, that's collateral damage, yeah, dead kids.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  Go out and play golf, smoke cigarettes, drink whiskey, you know what Obama does.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:32.760]  I mean, this is disgusting exploitation, and the high-fying makes me wanna throw up.
[03:12:32.760 --> 03:12:36.040]  Drudge has a photo of that up on his site, we can play it here for viewers.
[03:12:36.040 --> 03:12:39.160]  But radio listeners, we've got it linked up at info-wars.com as well.
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:41.660]  Yeah, there's the clapping and all of it.
[03:12:41.660 --> 03:12:45.240]  Here's the first clip, universal background checks, okay?
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:51.600]  Obama, we're gonna go to the clip, 11 minutes into his speech, he says 40% not checked,
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:54.680]  yeah, when you sell it to your neighbor, or they sell it to you.
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:13:00.240]  I mean, criminals are always gonna get guns, they bust cops all the time selling guns they've
[03:13:00.240 --> 03:13:01.240]  gotten in buybacks.
[03:13:01.240 --> 03:13:05.360]  So here's the universal background check comment by Obama.
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:10.020]  First, it's time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying
[03:13:10.020 --> 03:13:11.020]  to buy a gun.
[03:13:11.020 --> 03:13:14.960]  The law already requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks, and over the last
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:19.640]  14 years, that's kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun.
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:21.120]  All right, that's enough.
[03:13:21.120 --> 03:13:22.120]  But it's hard to enforce that, though.
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:26.320]  Yeah, but Adam Lanza, your patsy- When as many as 40% of all gun purchases are
[03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:28.880]  conducted- That's good, I'm gonna go back to the air.
[03:13:28.880 --> 03:13:36.040]  Adam Lanza, your patsy, I guess they're so used to me in the first hour talking over
[03:13:36.040 --> 03:13:37.040]  him, I'm doing it again.
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:38.440]  Yes, you're right.
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:46.080]  Adam Lanza, the patsy, or whoever he is, the whacked out of his mind, the cover of a Hollywood
[03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:49.760]  movie about mind control, same look in all these guys' eyes.
[03:13:49.760 --> 03:13:55.280]  On psychotropics, under psychiatric care, they fought like a devil to keep that from
[03:13:55.280 --> 03:14:00.400]  coming out, but his family's on record now.
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:03.160]  He tried to buy a gun five times and couldn't get one.
[03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:08.400]  I mean, obviously, going to gun shop, plus his mental illness was in the health record.
[03:14:08.400 --> 03:14:12.080]  They got filed, and he looked like he was whacked out of his brain.
[03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:15.960]  I've been at gun shows with private dealers, somebody selling off their collection.
[03:14:15.960 --> 03:14:19.280]  They don't sell to people that look like they're illegal aliens, they don't sell to people
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:20.280]  that don't.
[03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:21.720]  They'll talk to you before they sell you a gun.
[03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:23.320]  And so what if you're a felon?
[03:14:23.320 --> 03:14:24.920]  Most felons were innocent.
[03:14:24.920 --> 03:14:28.240]  Or who's to say if somebody did a white collar crime 20 years ago, they can't have a gun
[03:14:28.240 --> 03:14:29.240]  to protect themselves?
[03:14:29.240 --> 03:14:33.920]  Look, here's the deal, you try to take somebody's guns, they're gonna try to take your guns,
[03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:34.920]  it's real simple.
[03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:38.260]  In the old days, when you got let out of prison, if you were arrested with a gun that you legally
[03:14:38.260 --> 03:14:43.200]  owned, your gun until the 50s in most states was given back to you.
[03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:47.640]  Here's your shotgun you were arrested with, you bought down at Sears and Roebuck.
[03:14:47.640 --> 03:14:54.180]  Don't try to use that illegally, because people got it, a criminal's gonna get a gun anyways.
[03:14:54.180 --> 03:14:59.320]  And I understand it's a way to put criminals back in jail if you catch them with guns again.
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:05.360]  Look, all that should be in prison is violent offenders and white collar criminals, and
[03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:06.880]  you shouldn't be getting out.
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:10.760]  It was a lot less crime in this country back in the 30s and 40s and things.
[03:15:10.760 --> 03:15:16.440]  When if you did a robbery or something, you're gonna be in jail for ten years, busting rocks.
[03:15:16.440 --> 03:15:18.600]  Now it's like a college of criminal activity.
[03:15:18.600 --> 03:15:23.000]  Let's go ahead and go to a Second Amendment right of individuals to own for sport, hunting,
[03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  protection, and collection.
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:27.320]  Notice he had to stick protection in there.
[03:15:27.320 --> 03:15:31.440]  But how am I gonna protect myself from six or seven gang bangers if I don't have a semi-auto?
[03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:34.900]  And we've seen those countless videos of store owners and others.
[03:15:34.900 --> 03:15:37.920]  So this is Obama's version of the Second Amendment, here it is.
[03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:42.320]  Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to
[03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:43.800]  bear arms.
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:51.640]  I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen.
[03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:56.840]  There are millions of responsible, law-abiding gun owners in America who cherish their right
[03:15:56.840 --> 03:16:02.660]  to bear arms for hunting or sport or protection or collection.
[03:16:02.660 --> 03:16:07.040]  Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to
[03:16:07.040 --> 03:16:08.040]  bear arms.
[03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:09.440]  Hit pause for a moment.
[03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:15.040]  I respect our strong- The crew was asking me where was the smiling.
[03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:16.040]  There it was right there.
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:19.400]  I only watched about half of it cuz I was busy talking over it.
[03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:22.560]  And I turned it off a few times cuz I couldn't listen to it.
[03:16:22.560 --> 03:16:26.320]  Just while I was watching the continued smirking.
[03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:33.080]  It's like when you get caught doing something bad and it's funny, and your dad's going,
[03:16:33.080 --> 03:16:34.080]  I know you did it.
[03:16:34.080 --> 03:16:38.280]  I know, you know, don't lie and you're going, and it's like funny.
[03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:43.620]  I mean, this guy could not get the, you know what, eat and grin off his face.
[03:16:43.620 --> 03:16:44.920]  And the crew was asking me where it's at.
[03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:48.860]  I saw it like five, six times in just half of it I've watched.
[03:16:48.860 --> 03:16:50.080]  But I mean, there it is.
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:51.080]  Let's roll that again.
[03:16:51.080 --> 03:16:53.360]  Here it is.
[03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:56.720]  He's an individual right to bear arms.
[03:16:56.720 --> 03:17:01.640]  I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership- Did you see him hold the smile down?
[03:17:01.640 --> 03:17:02.640]  And the rights of hunters and sportsmen.
[03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:06.720]  He is so happy, he had to fight- There are millions of responsible law abiding
[03:17:06.720 --> 03:17:13.040]  gun owners in America who cherish their right to bear arms for hunting, or sport, or protection,
[03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:14.040]  or collection.
[03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:15.040]  There goes another smile.
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:17.320]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:17:17.320 --> 03:17:22.320]  And then he goes on to say at the 1554 Club, I wanna play that one.
[03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:26.480]  He says, we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law breaking
[03:17:26.480 --> 03:17:29.040]  few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.
[03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:32.440]  Yeah, by arming people in the school.
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:36.640]  The government has psychological profiles to know who's steadfast, who's always been
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:41.920]  to work on time, generally who's got a military style background or an Eagle Scout, people
[03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:42.920]  that are into duty.
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:45.720]  I mean, I'll tell you who you are, you are the football coaches.
[03:17:45.720 --> 03:17:48.960]  I mean, this is a no brainer.
[03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:54.360]  You arm honorable people, obviously the weird science teacher, who everybody knows is a
[03:17:54.360 --> 03:17:56.720]  perv or whatever.
[03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:02.440]  And you give them a psychological evaluation, I mean, I'm all for that just cuz you might
[03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:04.880]  end up getting a crazy someday as a teacher that kills people.
[03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:07.760]  Plus the kids are so out of control, who knows what will happen, you're getting assaulted.
[03:18:07.760 --> 03:18:14.320]  My point is to do psychological profiling and arm the teachers, or have retired cops
[03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:15.320]  who wanna work as janitors.
[03:18:15.320 --> 03:18:19.760]  Believe it, they would come and be happy to sweep the floors, be undercover and protect
[03:18:19.760 --> 03:18:23.600]  kids and put a couple of retired cops at every school.
[03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:28.280]  I mean, I bet you get cops that would do it for free, but you don't wanna do that, you
[03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:29.280]  wanna just pay them.
[03:18:29.280 --> 03:18:33.880]  I mean, this is a no brainer, but I don't want the police in there doing the anti-drug
[03:18:33.880 --> 03:18:36.000]  stuff and harassing people and things.
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:39.840]  Dealing with bullies, things like that's fine, but I guarantee you, they're saying they're
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:43.200]  gonna have federal police in there, we're gonna skip this break coming up.
[03:18:43.200 --> 03:18:48.320]  I guarantee you, they're gonna just turn this into a federal brainwashing, federal spying,
[03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:52.840]  federal anti-gun officers, which is actually what they're proposing.
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:57.400]  Instead of arm the teachers, and if the schools are too cowardly to do that, like Texas and
[03:18:57.400 --> 03:19:00.080]  other states are doing.
[03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:04.280]  I had that state superintendent on from that Texas town where they're 30 minutes from the
[03:19:04.280 --> 03:19:07.120]  local police department, but it's a big school out in the country.
[03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:12.640]  And he said, we saw mass shootings in 2007, and we're not gonna wait 30 minutes, and we're
[03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:15.400]  not gonna have our teachers illegally carrying guns in principle.
[03:19:15.400 --> 03:19:19.200]  So we have people that have concealed carry that we do some private training with the
[03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:23.040]  police and some building clearings tile stuff.
[03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:27.600]  But the feds don't want that, they want mass shooting training where you go get in a ball.
[03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:31.660]  And in every mass shooting, a teacher finally knocks the window out and tries to claw out
[03:19:31.660 --> 03:19:33.800]  the burglar bars to go out the window.
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:39.940]  I mean, if you hear boom, boom, boom shooting, it should be, if you really wanted to be serious
[03:19:39.940 --> 03:19:47.840]  for something that's still very rare, you would have collapsible stairs, a step ladder
[03:19:47.840 --> 03:19:48.840]  that was right there.
[03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:52.760]  And you'd open it and make sure the windows were openable from the inside to go out the
[03:19:52.760 --> 03:19:54.760]  window.
[03:19:54.760 --> 03:19:58.600]  We're skipping the break.
[03:19:58.600 --> 03:20:08.520]  I mean, it is just amazing, absolutely amazing what's going on here.
[03:20:08.520 --> 03:20:14.840]  I mean, they used to tell people, if you hear a nuclear bomb sirens go off, get under your
[03:20:14.840 --> 03:20:15.840]  desk.
[03:20:15.840 --> 03:20:19.200]  And it was just all about creating fear.
[03:20:19.200 --> 03:20:22.520]  But at least with that, the ceiling might fall on you, that actually might protect you.
[03:20:22.520 --> 03:20:25.760]  There was some reality there, even though it was done for fair mongering, that was later
[03:20:25.760 --> 03:20:28.760]  declassified.
[03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:37.280]  Getting in a ball when someone's coming to kill you is the last thing you wanna do.
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:41.960]  You've seen that lawyer where the guy's trying to kill him and the lawyer's dodging and he's
[03:20:41.960 --> 03:20:45.440]  getting shot in the arms, but he still gets all the way up on him and then hides behind
[03:20:45.440 --> 03:20:46.440]  a tree.
[03:20:46.440 --> 03:20:52.400]  I mean, if you're cornered, you're better to fight than just sit there and be a sitting
[03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:54.400]  duck.
[03:20:54.400 --> 03:21:00.280]  I thought that was Remo Williams, remember that movie, Remo Williams, pretty good B movie
[03:21:00.280 --> 03:21:07.600]  where the guy, yeah, Fred Ward, where the Japanese karate master knows how to dodge
[03:21:07.600 --> 03:21:08.600]  bullets.
[03:21:08.600 --> 03:21:11.440]  You've seen that footage of the lawyer, he dodges a bunch of them.
[03:21:11.440 --> 03:21:13.440]  That guy's got a revolver and he's like dodging it.
[03:21:13.440 --> 03:21:17.160]  I mean, if somebody pulls a gun on me and I don't have a gun, that's what's gonna happen,
[03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:19.120]  is that I'm gonna dodge him.
[03:21:19.120 --> 03:21:24.120]  And if somebody came into my house and I couldn't get to a gun or a restaurant, I guarantee
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:28.600]  you without thinking I would go throw myself at them, just like Susanna Hupp's dad did
[03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:30.640]  in that Luby saving a bunch of people.
[03:21:30.640 --> 03:21:35.360]  Not because I'm a hero, folks, you couldn't control me.
[03:21:35.360 --> 03:21:38.480]  And I just don't know how we've gotten to the point where a lot of people just kneel
[03:21:38.480 --> 03:21:39.480]  down.
[03:21:39.480 --> 03:21:42.240]  You're shooting people and they just, you're shooting them in a row?
[03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:44.560]  Let me just get ready and put my head down.
[03:21:44.560 --> 03:21:46.960]  Let me put my head down while you shoot me.
[03:21:46.960 --> 03:21:50.520]  I mean, where is the survival instinct?
[03:21:50.520 --> 03:21:53.520]  Every mammal I know.
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:58.360]  I remember I was about five, six years old, my grandmother had these mousetraps out for
[03:21:58.360 --> 03:22:01.320]  mice and rats out in the country they were getting in the house.
[03:22:01.320 --> 03:22:04.240]  And I never even told them about this story, cuz it didn't really even break the flesh,
[03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:05.240]  like partially did.
[03:22:05.240 --> 03:22:08.280]  I was like three, four, five, I don't remember how old I was, it was real little.
[03:22:08.280 --> 03:22:11.560]  It was on the back porch and there was a bucket and there was a rat in it.
[03:22:11.560 --> 03:22:13.560]  It had fallen in the bucket, it was trying to get out.
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:15.940]  And I wanted to be nice and help him get out.
[03:22:15.940 --> 03:22:19.160]  And I reached in there and that rat bit me.
[03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:23.240]  One time a honeybee was in the baby pool and I wanted to say that it stung me and I really
[03:22:23.240 --> 03:22:24.240]  cried.
[03:22:24.240 --> 03:22:26.720]  My dad said, it was one of my first memories, I was about two and a half, cuz I wanted to
[03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:29.800]  help the bee and it stung me, I didn't know why it was mean to me.
[03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:36.080]  But the point is, is that a rat will bite you, a raccoon will bite you, a dog will bite
[03:22:36.080 --> 03:22:44.040]  you, a seal will bite you, a woodchuck will bite you, a otter will bite you, a wildcat
[03:22:44.040 --> 03:22:50.160]  will bite you, a puma will bite you, a cow will bite you and head bite you.
[03:22:50.160 --> 03:22:54.880]  A bunny rabbit will bite you, a deer will bite and kick you.
[03:22:54.880 --> 03:22:59.960]  Every mammal fights back, it's automatic if you're cornered.
[03:22:59.960 --> 03:23:04.040]  And they're trying to take our basic instinct of defending ourselves away.
[03:23:04.040 --> 03:23:12.960]  And that's why they hate the gun culture because it's helping us redevelop and rediscover that.
[03:23:12.960 --> 03:23:19.180]  Let's go to this bizarre 1647 clip, pundits saying it's all about all out assault by tyrants
[03:23:19.180 --> 03:23:20.320]  on liberty.
[03:23:20.320 --> 03:23:23.100]  Let's go to Obama responding to his critics, here it is.
[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:25.780]  This will be difficult.
[03:23:25.780 --> 03:23:30.200]  There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning
[03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:35.520]  of a tyrannical all out assault on liberty.
[03:23:35.520 --> 03:23:44.300]  Not because that's true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue
[03:23:44.300 --> 03:23:45.300]  for themselves.
[03:23:45.300 --> 03:23:47.820]  Oh, I wonder who you're talking about, punk.
[03:23:47.820 --> 03:23:52.640]  And behind the scenes, they'll do everything they can to block any common sense reform
[03:23:52.640 --> 03:23:55.240]  and make sure nothing changes whatsoever.
[03:23:55.240 --> 03:23:57.240]  Yeah.
[03:23:57.240 --> 03:24:02.520]  The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their
[03:24:02.520 --> 03:24:06.240]  members- Let's stop right there.
[03:24:06.240 --> 03:24:08.200]  That is a profound statement.
[03:24:08.200 --> 03:24:11.400]  And he's thinking about Alex Jones.
[03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:13.680]  He's thinking about Matt Drudge.
[03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:15.960]  He's thinking about Glenn Beck.
[03:24:15.960 --> 03:24:21.040]  He's thinking about Larry Pratt, Wayne LaPierre.
[03:24:21.040 --> 03:24:25.240]  I mean, guaranteed, cuz the White House has responded to me before.
[03:24:25.240 --> 03:24:28.760]  And it's come out that Homeland Security's got files on Matt Drudge and Alex Jones and
[03:24:28.760 --> 03:24:29.760]  all this stuff.
[03:24:29.760 --> 03:24:33.360]  And there's been lawsuits over, but they won't release them by InfraGard, that's a board
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:36.840]  member of the NRA, Bob Barr, former congressman.
[03:24:36.840 --> 03:24:41.800]  I mean, they're talking about us, cuz that's incredible.
[03:24:41.800 --> 03:24:47.600]  While they're up there, they know we know they're crooks.
[03:24:47.600 --> 03:24:52.840]  I mean, these people shipped 20,000 plus guns into Mexico.
[03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:57.160]  The gun dealers allowing guns to walk under ATF orders, that's just the least of it, so
[03:24:57.160 --> 03:24:59.520]  the media focused on that to divert.
[03:24:59.520 --> 03:25:00.700]  They shipped hand grenades.
[03:25:00.700 --> 03:25:05.760]  They had the US Army get weapons down there, 18 wheelers, rocket launchers, to try to just
[03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:10.920]  wreck Mexico so they could then say there's a bunch of US guns doing it to blame our Second
[03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:11.920]  Amendment.
[03:25:11.920 --> 03:25:14.200]  And again, that all came out.
[03:25:14.200 --> 03:25:15.920]  You know how gangster that is?
[03:25:15.920 --> 03:25:20.860]  That is a false flag.
[03:25:20.860 --> 03:25:26.640]  And they're doing the same thing right now.
[03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:29.960]  And I'm gonna be honest with you, again, I didn't watch that full speech, and I was only
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:30.960]  reading these quotes.
[03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:32.360]  That was a stunning quote.
[03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:34.520]  We're gonna do overdrive the whole hour.
[03:25:34.520 --> 03:25:37.880]  Guys, back that back up for me if you can, and I know you've moved to the next clip.
[03:25:37.880 --> 03:25:41.100]  I wanna go back to 1647, that is just stunning.
[03:25:41.100 --> 03:25:45.920]  And you can see him holding back his mafia smirk, hey, that Goodfella business, Biden
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:50.040]  might work for you in New York and Chicago and places, okay, nothing against New Yorkers
[03:25:50.040 --> 03:25:51.040]  or Chicagoans.
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:55.080]  They're great people, but because they've been such wealthy areas, the criminals all
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:57.720]  ran there and they've run your areas for 100 years.
[03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:04.000]  I mean, all that Goodfella crud and your shark skin suits and all that may intimidate people.
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:07.600]  And you may think it's funny to sit there with your, I mean, they look like Robert DeNiro
[03:26:07.600 --> 03:26:09.200]  and Goodfellas.
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:10.400]  Great Martin Scorsese movie.
[03:26:10.400 --> 03:26:14.120]  I watched it again, it's a true story, with my wife Saturday night.
[03:26:14.120 --> 03:26:20.320]  And that same fake confidence makes my blood literally boil.
[03:26:20.320 --> 03:26:25.520]  And they cannot stand the fact that I got up there and said, you wanna take our guns,
[03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:26.520]  you wanna enslave us.
[03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:29.040]  And that was the number one story in the country for two days.
[03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:37.320]  They were talking about Alex Jones first and foremost.
[03:26:37.320 --> 03:26:41.520]  That's why we need your prayers, because they go, you're discredited, you're yelling at
[03:26:41.520 --> 03:26:43.080]  us, you're calling us criminals.
[03:26:43.080 --> 03:26:44.400]  That's not a real debate.
[03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:46.840]  You're not a real person having a real debate.
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:52.020]  You're not like my neighbor coming over and going, hey, we don't have enough land to have
[03:26:52.020 --> 03:26:53.440]  an agriculture exemption.
[03:26:53.440 --> 03:26:58.040]  But if we combine together and get an agriculture exemption, we can get off on our taxes.
[03:26:58.040 --> 03:27:02.960]  If we put honeybees on it or maybe a cow or two, how's that sound?
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:03.960]  You wanna do that?
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:04.960]  Man, that's a really good idea.
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:06.240]  Yeah, that'll lower our taxes massively.
[03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:10.600]  I've been so busy, I really haven't had time to go talk to you, I'm glad you reached out
[03:27:10.600 --> 03:27:11.600]  to do that.
[03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:12.600]  Yeah, let's do that.
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:15.800]  I waited so long, the neighbor went ahead and just bought some more properties they
[03:27:15.800 --> 03:27:16.800]  could do it, but they're still nice enough.
[03:27:16.800 --> 03:27:19.320]  I'm gonna talk to them, but let me merge in with them.
[03:27:19.320 --> 03:27:22.360]  But the point is, that's a negotiation, that's a good faith.
[03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:31.000]  I'm talking to my neighbor, hey, how you doing there, Jesse, or whoever the neighbor is,
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:32.120]  how are you doing today?
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:36.640]  Let's talk about, as regular people, nice calm voices, hey, come on in and have a cup
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:38.200]  of coffee.
[03:27:38.200 --> 03:27:42.480]  When somebody is a known liar, telling me they don't want my guns when they're sworn
[03:27:42.480 --> 03:27:43.720]  to get them.
[03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:48.200]  And there are a bunch of crooks that cause mass murder in Mexico and the US Southwest
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:52.680]  to blame the Second Amendment and scapegoat gun owners and use a bunch of dead Mexican
[03:27:52.680 --> 03:27:53.680]  kids.
[03:27:53.680 --> 03:27:57.320]  Mexico has press conferences, Calderon did it, we gotta do a piece on that.
[03:27:57.320 --> 03:28:02.200]  He got a bunch of Mexican kids around him and said, America, we ban your guns, it's
[03:28:02.200 --> 03:28:03.200]  your fault.
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:07.680]  I mean, it's the most ridiculous script, and the White House did it, and the guy that did
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:13.360]  it, killing thousands of people and hundreds of children, is trying to blame you and I
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:14.360]  for it.
[03:28:14.360 --> 03:28:18.720]  And then we get angry and they go, you're discredited, and only the sheep go, yeah,
[03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:20.280]  you're discredited when you get angry.
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:29.080]  But when they go have rallies with Cuomo and gangsters like the godfather of Chicago, Emanuel,
[03:28:29.080 --> 03:28:33.040]  they start going, we're gonna do it, yeah, yeah, we're gonna get the guns.
[03:28:33.040 --> 03:28:38.040]  But with us, no, don't get excited, hold on, you just sit right there and you take a deep
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:41.520]  breath and you calm down and you're discredited, okay?
[03:28:41.520 --> 03:28:46.340]  But you notice the president in his press conference, what did he say?
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:49.580]  He said, there are gonna be people saying this is tyranny, there are gonna be people
[03:28:49.580 --> 03:28:50.920]  saying the government's evil.
[03:28:50.920 --> 03:28:56.880]  And he does this little gangster satisfaction, he's not even a good liar now, he goes, and
[03:28:56.880 --> 03:29:03.640]  they're lying, they're wrong, I mean, that is the most incredible thing, the President
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:10.480]  of the United States is directly responding to us, there's no doubt, no doubt.
[03:29:10.480 --> 03:29:17.120]  And I've entered this insane vortex where I've got all these pundits on, and they're
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:21.400]  saying, yeah, Alex, you're pretty much the most prominent voice now, I didn't even want
[03:29:21.400 --> 03:29:22.400]  that.
[03:29:22.400 --> 03:29:27.920]  I mean, this is creepville on steroids, cuz let me tell you, I'm a macho guy and I don't
[03:29:27.920 --> 03:29:34.000]  like tyrants, but I gotta be honest, it is creepy to have the president responding to
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:35.000]  you.
[03:29:35.000 --> 03:29:37.560]  And let me tell you, they're thinking about a group of people there, but right in the
[03:29:37.560 --> 03:29:42.240]  middle is me, I mean, he's thinking about a group of people.
[03:29:42.240 --> 03:29:48.920]  And cuz it's come out that we're in their internal stuff, but I mean, it's just unbelievable,
[03:29:48.920 --> 03:29:50.600]  that criminal now responding to me.
[03:29:50.600 --> 03:29:57.760]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:57.760 --> 03:30:07.760]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you

[03:30:35.520 --> 03:30:41.760]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:30:41.760 --> 03:30:49.200]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:50.680]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:30:50.680 --> 03:30:53.080]  The war is here.

[03:30:54.960 --> 03:31:02.600]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

[03:32:01.320 --> 03:32:05.520]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better
[03:32:05.520 --> 03:32:09.080]  than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood
[03:32:09.080 --> 03:32:12.240]  sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:32:12.240 --> 03:32:15.840]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of
[03:32:15.840 --> 03:32:16.840]  them.
[03:32:16.840 --> 03:32:18.320]  It's called heart and body extract.
[03:32:18.320 --> 03:32:22.680]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects
[03:32:22.680 --> 03:32:24.160]  of heart and body extract.
[03:32:24.160 --> 03:32:28.400]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary
[03:32:28.400 --> 03:32:34.160]  vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[03:32:34.160 --> 03:32:38.720]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,
[03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:40.080]  clean and unclog the arteries.
[03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:44.160]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetic stuff.
[03:32:44.160 --> 03:32:46.000]  The body is an amazing thing.
[03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:49.260]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[03:32:49.260 --> 03:32:51.640]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[03:33:26.720 --> 03:33:33.960]  What these psycho dungeon keepers really like is putting innocent people in jails.
[03:33:33.960 --> 03:33:38.760]  You know, when freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails and those that cried appease
[03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:44.040]  appease are hung by those they tried to please.
[03:33:44.040 --> 03:33:45.040]  I'm not afraid of dying.
[03:33:45.040 --> 03:33:47.400]  I don't want to be locked up in one of their dungeons, man.
[03:33:47.400 --> 03:33:50.160]  If they ever lock me up in one of their dungeons, I'm innocent.
[03:33:50.160 --> 03:33:51.160]  Get me out.
[03:33:51.160 --> 03:33:52.160]  Oh, man.
[03:33:52.160 --> 03:33:56.080]  Again, I hadn't seen the whole speech.
[03:33:56.080 --> 03:33:59.680]  I was reading over the transcripts and now we're playing clips of it and the whole crew
[03:33:59.680 --> 03:34:00.920]  said they were back there having lunch.
[03:34:00.920 --> 03:34:04.760]  Well, part of the crew, the TV crew, they said, no, no, we knew they were talking about
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:07.520]  you because obviously I came out saying it's tyranny.
[03:34:07.520 --> 03:34:09.120]  It's a takeover last week.
[03:34:09.120 --> 03:34:10.200]  That was the big story.
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:16.800]  The White House responded at the end of Piers Morgan to my petition and denied it as if
[03:34:16.800 --> 03:34:19.720]  they could have ever deported him because I asked anyways.
[03:34:19.720 --> 03:34:23.200]  We were just showing how your whole petition's a fraud anyways.
[03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:24.200]  You're not a dictator.
[03:34:24.200 --> 03:34:26.040]  You're trying to be one.
[03:34:26.040 --> 03:34:29.840]  Any country where you give a petition to the president and they can do whatever they want,
[03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:32.680]  that's not called a president, it's called a dictator.
[03:34:32.680 --> 03:34:37.160]  And by the way, Rand Paul, two congressmen, more congressmen, they're calling him a dictator,
[03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:38.160]  a king.
[03:34:38.160 --> 03:34:41.360]  They're talking about impeachment and they're talking about how they're gonna impeach him.
[03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:42.480]  Let's go.
[03:34:42.480 --> 03:34:45.280]  It's not, hey, if you keep pushing, we're gonna impeach you.
[03:34:45.280 --> 03:34:50.400]  We've got a grandstander up there telling us it's our fault when more kids get killed
[03:34:50.400 --> 03:34:53.560]  when they're the ones trying to block armed guards in the schools.
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:54.560]  Remember that?
[03:34:54.560 --> 03:34:59.360]  And he's trying to get the people organized to overthrow their own Bill of Rights and
[03:34:59.360 --> 03:35:00.360]  Constitution.
[03:35:00.360 --> 03:35:02.360]  That is sedition.
[03:35:02.360 --> 03:35:08.400]  He is trying to turn all of our cities into crime-ridden, mafia-dawn areas like he controls,
[03:35:08.400 --> 03:35:11.840]  and we don't want any part of it.
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:17.240]  White House now requires we the people petitions to have 100,000 signatures for official response.
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:20.760]  Yeah, well, they responded to the states' rights ones that had hundreds of thousands
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:22.880]  and he said, no, there are no states.
[03:35:22.880 --> 03:35:23.880]  I am your Supreme Leader.
[03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:27.080]  All right, I wanna go to your phone calls, but let's play this clip again.
[03:35:27.080 --> 03:35:30.040]  Pundits saying it's all about assault by tyrants.
[03:35:30.040 --> 03:35:36.160]  I mean, Obama brought in unconstitutional Obamacare openly.
[03:35:36.160 --> 03:35:45.380]  Hey, guys, will you come, hold on one second, man, will you come, guys, talk to this Canadian
[03:35:45.380 --> 03:35:48.320]  TV thing cuz I'm doing overdrive and just set me up for Skype.
[03:35:48.320 --> 03:35:49.320]  Ma'am, hold on one second.
[03:35:49.320 --> 03:35:50.320]  Here you go.
[03:35:50.320 --> 03:35:54.640]  I mean, they just all have gotten my cell phone number somehow, they're just calling
[03:35:54.640 --> 03:35:58.000]  and calling and BBC's on there too.
[03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:00.800]  And then Good Morning America's on there, I never even told you this morning about it.
[03:36:00.800 --> 03:36:04.760]  So I gotta deal with that, I gotta get more producers, more people, they're working hard
[03:36:04.760 --> 03:36:05.760]  in there.
[03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:07.600]  There's just too much going on.
[03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:08.600]  What was I getting into?
[03:36:08.600 --> 03:36:12.000]  I told, yeah, pundits, we're gonna play pundits.
[03:36:12.000 --> 03:36:15.340]  I know there's gonna be idiots on YouTube in places that aren't listening to the radio
[03:36:15.340 --> 03:36:16.920]  or not watching us on prisonplanet.tv.
[03:36:16.920 --> 03:36:21.320]  Look at this crazy guy, he says the White House is responding to him.
[03:36:21.320 --> 03:36:27.600]  They responded to my petition and said they were watching Piers Morgan, Jay Carney did.
[03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:29.200]  That's the White House press secretary.
[03:36:29.200 --> 03:36:34.660]  Myself, Matt Drudge and others have come out that Homeland Security has files on us just
[03:36:34.660 --> 03:36:36.600]  for our covering the TSA.
[03:36:36.600 --> 03:36:40.660]  Big Sis has responded and talked about Matt Drudge, the White House has.
[03:36:40.660 --> 03:36:46.800]  We have the tens of millions of listeners and viewers and readers.
[03:36:46.800 --> 03:36:52.280]  Piers Morgan has half a million until I went on his show and went up to a million.
[03:36:52.280 --> 03:36:54.240]  And then tens of millions cuz it was aired everywhere else.
[03:36:54.240 --> 03:37:02.600]  I mean, it's an illusion that the president is a nobody punk, he's not our president.
[03:37:02.600 --> 03:37:06.320]  And then they try this just cuz you're racist folks, if there was a black guy that was like
[03:37:06.320 --> 03:37:08.920]  George Washington, I'd wash his feet.
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:14.360]  I'm so sick of what color people are, I don't care about their hearts and their minds, the
[03:37:14.360 --> 03:37:15.760]  character of their deeds.
[03:37:15.760 --> 03:37:19.520]  And I'm sick of these racists standing behind a race, they're not even racist though, they
[03:37:19.520 --> 03:37:22.040]  use it to manipulate.
[03:37:22.040 --> 03:37:25.440]  And Obama is a clear and present danger to this republic.
[03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:30.840]  And I'm saying second American Revolution, peaceful secession, boom, people are listening.
[03:37:30.840 --> 03:37:35.160]  I'm saying it's time to impeach his butt, okay?
[03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:39.480]  And he's responding to us and they are hacking our site and doing every dirty trick you can
[03:37:39.480 --> 03:37:40.480]  imagine.
[03:37:40.480 --> 03:37:47.320]  We need people to help us, if they bring infowars.com down, it doesn't matter, we'll just set up
[03:37:47.320 --> 03:37:51.480]  alternate backup sites and we'll get our news out one way or the other.
[03:37:51.480 --> 03:37:54.720]  You're not gonna stop any of us, okay?
[03:37:54.720 --> 03:37:58.000]  But if these are sophisticated, obviously governmental things going on, I'm not gonna
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:37:59.480]  get into the nature of them.
[03:37:59.480 --> 03:38:03.360]  I saw there's one a piggyback on the exploitations, but it is not fun.
[03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:07.080]  And we have people up 24 hours a day, we're gonna put more on the job and it'll just make
[03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:09.720]  us stronger by the grace of God.
[03:38:09.720 --> 03:38:14.140]  But they're mad, because no one will call them what they are, low down gangster thug
[03:38:14.140 --> 03:38:18.840]  criminals and waging war against our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:38:18.840 --> 03:38:23.720]  Putting us under UN command, passing Obamacare, raising taxes on poor people.
[03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:29.960]  Man, I tell you, that makes me these helpless, sad, a lot of people laugh at these Obama
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:34.440]  noise and I've done it to myself cuz it's funny.
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:36.160]  It's funny cuz they sound funny.
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:39.200]  I told the Obama lady, I said, you sound like a Muppet.
[03:38:39.200 --> 03:38:42.200]  I said, I have laughed at you, but I care about you as a human.
[03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:44.000]  I don't know if I should laugh or cry.
[03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:48.040]  And then I showed her how he lied and said he wouldn't raise taxes and how he lied and
[03:38:48.040 --> 03:38:49.040]  said he wouldn't come after the gun.
[03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:51.560]  She goes, wow, I never saw that, he is a liar.
[03:38:51.560 --> 03:38:56.160]  And my whole point is I want her to have a future, I want her to have a country, I want
[03:38:56.160 --> 03:39:01.920]  her to be free, I care about her soul, her mind.
[03:39:01.920 --> 03:39:04.400]  And the media just says, no, you're racist if you don't vote for Obama.
[03:39:04.400 --> 03:39:07.800]  I mean, it's just such a dumbed down, how obvious does it have to get?
[03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:11.160]  Here's the kids, I'm high-fiving, I'm gonna get the guns for you kids.
[03:39:11.160 --> 03:39:15.240]  The kids said, you're against the little five-year-old if you don't give me my guns.
[03:39:15.240 --> 03:39:18.640]  But I'm not, I'm not a tyrant.
[03:39:18.640 --> 03:39:23.000]  There's no tyranny, there's nothing wrong going on anywhere.
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:27.280]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:39:27.280 --> 03:39:33.080]  They are attacking me and others because we're aggressive.
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:35.400]  And they wanna just normalize all this tyranny.
[03:39:35.400 --> 03:39:37.560]  Let's go to this clip one more time, here it is.
[03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:40.240]  This will be difficult.
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:44.660]  There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning
[03:39:44.660 --> 03:39:49.960]  of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.
[03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:58.760]  Not because that's true, but because they wanna gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue
[03:39:58.760 --> 03:40:02.280]  for themselves.
[03:40:02.280 --> 03:40:07.080]  And behind the scenes, they'll do everything they can to block any common sense reform
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:09.240]  and make sure nothing changes whatsoever.
[03:40:09.240 --> 03:40:11.680]  No, that's not true.
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:17.000]  The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:22.600]  membership says this time must be different.
[03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:31.700]  And that's what they call it, now is the time and his executive orders that are now out.
[03:40:31.700 --> 03:40:35.080]  Up there with those dead kids trying to blame gun owners for it.
[03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:38.300]  And we've said, don't make schools victim disarmament zones.
[03:40:38.300 --> 03:40:46.080]  We've said, get people off these Prozac type drugs that 20% of the country's on roughly.
[03:40:46.080 --> 03:40:50.440]  Don't have the federal government demand that foster kids be put on psychotropics, 67% of
[03:40:50.440 --> 03:40:51.440]  them.
[03:40:51.440 --> 03:40:54.840]  I mean, they know the vaccines are killing people, it's on the inserts, they can kill
[03:40:54.840 --> 03:40:55.840]  you.
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:40:59.120]  And they get on the news and go, there are no side effects, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:01.440]  I've shown you news clips, I've shown you news articles.
[03:41:01.440 --> 03:41:04.360]  These people do not care about you.
[03:41:04.360 --> 03:41:10.360]  And he represents Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
[03:41:10.360 --> 03:41:12.920]  We've got to start a protest, those guys start pulling money out of them.
[03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:16.480]  I guess that's the answer is just go after the banks.
[03:41:16.480 --> 03:41:19.300]  The foreign banks, I mean, I guess that's it, he's just their agent.
[03:41:19.300 --> 03:41:23.020]  And they've taken the country over by fraud and now they don't want us armed to ever be
[03:41:23.020 --> 03:41:26.080]  able to get our country back because they're planning real tyranny.
[03:41:26.080 --> 03:41:29.960]  They want those guns so bad because they're in a race before everything collapses.
[03:41:29.960 --> 03:41:34.040]  Because if it all collapses, they'll use it to be able to take over and get control.
[03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:38.840]  But if we have guns and fight off the roving hordes of welfare people burning things, that
[03:41:38.840 --> 03:41:40.760]  won't play into their hands, will it?
[03:41:40.760 --> 03:41:44.880]  So they've got to get guns demonized so they can have cover to wage their homeland security
[03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:49.080]  war on gun owners, and that's the plan.
[03:41:49.080 --> 03:41:55.040]  The NSA, the whole homeland security system and giant anti-gun checkpoints, and that's
[03:41:55.040 --> 03:41:59.040]  what these federally funded quote gang checkpoints are all over the country.
[03:41:59.040 --> 03:42:01.440]  Texas is heading it up, totally unconstitutional.
[03:42:01.440 --> 03:42:06.360]  But see, Texas thinks conservative means police state, no, it means the opposite.
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:10.080]  So they're like, well, yeah, we have crimes, we're gonna have checkpoints to look for gang
[03:42:10.080 --> 03:42:11.080]  members.
[03:42:11.080 --> 03:42:12.080]  No, it's just a search our cars.
[03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:15.180]  You know where the gang members are, I can take it to them right now selling crack cocaine
[03:42:15.180 --> 03:42:16.180]  five miles from here.
[03:42:16.180 --> 03:42:19.920]  Let's go to a few more clubs than your calls.
[03:42:19.920 --> 03:42:25.260]  Let's just say I can't just be the usual suspects.
[03:42:25.260 --> 03:42:29.040]  Let's play that club, here it is.
[03:42:29.040 --> 03:42:30.040]  That's 18-
[03:42:30.040 --> 03:42:34.840]  We are responsible for each other.
[03:42:34.840 --> 03:42:36.400]  It's okay, go ahead and play that one.
[03:42:36.400 --> 03:42:37.400]  It's all right, guys.
[03:42:37.400 --> 03:42:38.400]  I know we got a bunch of clips here.
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:40.400]  We are responsible for each other.
[03:42:40.400 --> 03:42:49.800]  Okay, do you wanna play 18-12 now or, got a whole bunch of clips there in our primitive
[03:42:49.800 --> 03:42:50.800]  computers.
[03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:55.600]  Well, it just says 18-12, I can't just pass the usual suspects, we've got them highlighted
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:42:56.600]  right here.
[03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:58.400]  I was just going off the ones I highlighted.
[03:42:58.400 --> 03:43:00.360]  It doesn't matter, hey, that's great.
[03:43:00.360 --> 03:43:02.360]  Which one can we go to next?
[03:43:02.360 --> 03:43:09.760]  Okay, well, let's just go ahead and play the next clip, yeah, let's go ahead and play it.
[03:43:09.760 --> 03:43:13.920]  Soon as I'm finished speaking here, I will sit at that desk and I will sign a directive
[03:43:13.920 --> 03:43:20.000]  giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals, and the public health community
[03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:24.840]  some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence.
[03:43:24.840 --> 03:43:28.580]  We will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening the
[03:43:28.580 --> 03:43:31.520]  background check system.
[03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:37.920]  We will help schools hire more resource officers if they want them and develop emergency preparedness
[03:43:37.920 --> 03:43:39.980]  plans.
[03:43:39.980 --> 03:43:43.720]  We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of
[03:43:43.720 --> 03:43:48.760]  violence even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to
[03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:51.160]  be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator.
[03:43:51.160 --> 03:43:53.520]  All right, let's stop right there.
[03:43:53.520 --> 03:43:57.880]  Their main mission is to say everybody's mentally ill, or get you on welfare, or get you in
[03:43:57.880 --> 03:44:01.840]  the criminal justice system to say now you don't have your rights and make you a slave
[03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:02.840]  of the state.
[03:44:02.840 --> 03:44:06.240]  This is just modern forms of slavery.
[03:44:06.240 --> 03:44:10.520]  They know exactly what they're doing and they exempt themselves from all their garbage.
[03:44:10.520 --> 03:44:14.040]  They've got get out of jail free cards, literally.
[03:44:14.040 --> 03:44:17.440]  Congress gets caught insider trading, they go, guess what, we'll pass a law to make it
[03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:18.440]  illegal.
[03:44:18.440 --> 03:44:19.440]  It was already illegal.
[03:44:19.440 --> 03:44:28.880]  Then the law they pass legalizes them insider trading if the House or Senate Ethics Committee
[03:44:28.880 --> 03:44:34.000]  run by some of the worst offenders, it's like, well, if the other fox says that I'm allowed
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:35.680]  to go eat the hens, it's okay.
[03:44:35.680 --> 03:44:40.600]  It'd be like Stalin saying, well, if the Politburo says I can kill 10 million Ukrainians, I can,
[03:44:40.600 --> 03:44:41.600]  that makes it legal.
[03:44:41.600 --> 03:44:46.960]  Or it'd be like Heinrich Himmler saying, well, we can kill all these people in death camps
[03:44:46.960 --> 03:44:49.880]  if Hitler says it's okay.
[03:44:49.880 --> 03:44:54.640]  Mr Hitler of Der Fuehrer, can you sign this order to make it all legal?
[03:44:54.640 --> 03:44:58.320]  Mr President, can you sign this order for drone attacks to legally bomb countries and
[03:44:58.320 --> 03:45:00.680]  kill innocent people?
[03:45:00.680 --> 03:45:05.320]  You signed the order, you didn't have authority, you say NATO gave it to you, not Congress.
[03:45:05.320 --> 03:45:08.000]  Okay, they're our boss now.
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:10.400]  One more clip, one more clip.
[03:45:10.400 --> 03:45:12.140]  This is really creepy collectivism.
[03:45:12.140 --> 03:45:15.240]  You heard, we have rights to be safe in our schools.
[03:45:15.240 --> 03:45:17.480]  We have rights to be safe in our churches.
[03:45:17.480 --> 03:45:22.320]  We have rights to be safe in Chicago, where we've taken all the guns and the mafia runs
[03:45:22.320 --> 03:45:23.320]  things.
[03:45:23.320 --> 03:45:25.320]  I didn't mean to say that.
[03:45:25.320 --> 03:45:30.800]  See, it's this collectivism where you as a group of gun owners, you are responsible for
[03:45:30.800 --> 03:45:31.800]  the dead kids.
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:35.720]  And he's had his pundits come out and say that, and that makes me mad.
[03:45:35.720 --> 03:45:41.960]  They're trying to guilt me into giving up my rights when he's nothing but a lowdown
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:42.960]  criminal.
[03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:45.680]  And again, I've listed the articles of impeachment.
[03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:50.920]  He is a criminal, and I've listed the proof at infoawards.com.
[03:45:50.920 --> 03:45:53.060]  We are responsible for each other.
[03:45:53.060 --> 03:45:57.040]  Listen to this weirdness now, this stazzy state they're announcing, where everybody's
[03:45:57.040 --> 03:45:59.520]  spying and cuddling, and it's collective.
[03:45:59.520 --> 03:46:03.360]  We're all in socialist healthcare now, so you're not allowed to eat that steak cuz I
[03:46:03.360 --> 03:46:04.840]  gotta pay for your healthcare.
[03:46:04.840 --> 03:46:08.920]  You're not allowed to drink that Coca-Cola or that beer now, because I say it's bad for
[03:46:08.920 --> 03:46:09.920]  you.
[03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:13.200]  And it's a nanny state, and we're the collective.
[03:46:13.200 --> 03:46:18.080]  And we're gonna get the gun manufacturers, NRA here, not the Second Amendment, but stakeholders
[03:46:18.080 --> 03:46:20.120]  to decide if we're gonna ban the guns.
[03:46:20.120 --> 03:46:23.040]  All this UN talk, let's go to that clip.
[03:46:23.040 --> 03:46:27.480]  We are responsible for each other.
[03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:34.960]  Again, we are responsible for each other, and it ties into all the rest of the garbage.
[03:46:34.960 --> 03:46:38.920]  We're gonna be playing more of these clips tonight on the transmission.
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:41.280]  Let's just go to more calls here.
[03:46:41.280 --> 03:46:44.280]  Antoine in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:46:44.280 --> 03:46:45.280]  Hey, buddy.
[03:46:45.280 --> 03:46:54.360]  I just wanna get a couple points for us, just I think we need to get on the offensive.
[03:46:54.360 --> 03:47:00.600]  I think I was talking to a couple friends, I think we should march on DC with fake guns
[03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:04.720]  cuz I don't want them to put a real person with a gun and say that we shoot people just
[03:47:04.720 --> 03:47:08.360]  to symbolize the guns that we have.
[03:47:08.360 --> 03:47:12.120]  And we should also, I also think you should do a special report cuz your special reports
[03:47:12.120 --> 03:47:13.120]  are very effective.
[03:47:13.120 --> 03:47:15.880]  I was able to wake up a lot of people through your special reports.
[03:47:15.880 --> 03:47:20.720]  If you could somehow, I know you're very busy, and make a really good special report showing
[03:47:20.720 --> 03:47:23.720]  everything that you talked about, how we got here, that'd be really great.
[03:47:23.720 --> 03:47:27.080]  I mean, Facebook or social media, I've woken up a lot of people, just like you woke up
[03:47:27.080 --> 03:47:31.040]  that lady, the Obama phone lady, right there on the air in front of us all.
[03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:32.400]  I've done that to a lot.
[03:47:32.400 --> 03:47:36.920]  I'm African American myself, and personally, every African American that I know that's
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:38.960]  under 30 knows that he's a crook.
[03:47:38.960 --> 03:47:41.800]  Now, the ones that are above 30 think he's God.
[03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:45.840]  Well, that's what I've noticed cuz I do get obsessed reading YouTube comments.
[03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:50.280]  And I go to the channels and look, and it's like most of the comments not just on my YouTube
[03:47:50.280 --> 03:47:54.160]  channel, but others are like, this is a crook, we warned you, he's coming.
[03:47:54.160 --> 03:47:59.960]  It's black people criticizing him, but then the media says 95% of blacks support Obama.
[03:47:59.960 --> 03:48:05.360]  I don't think that's true, and I don't think these polls we hear that only 15% don't wanna
[03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:06.920]  turn their guns in.
[03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:08.720]  I mean, that's not what I'm seeing or hearing.
[03:48:08.720 --> 03:48:11.680]  I don't believe these polls.
[03:48:11.680 --> 03:48:15.600]  And trust me, I'm in the black community, I mean, my grandmother cried cuz I wouldn't
[03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:16.600]  vote for Obama.
[03:48:16.600 --> 03:48:19.600]  That's how bad it is to vote for Obama.
[03:48:19.600 --> 03:48:24.040]  Okay, I was playing it to her all, and it was really weird.
[03:48:24.040 --> 03:48:28.760]  They were contradicting themselves while I'm laying out the hardcore facts in their face.
[03:48:28.760 --> 03:48:32.520]  You know, I've talked to folks who told their parents he's coming for the guns, and they
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:33.520]  didn't agree.
[03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:34.520]  But now he's coming for them.
[03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:36.480]  You're right, but see, it's kind of too late.
[03:48:36.480 --> 03:48:39.800]  But I mean, look, he said he wouldn't raise taxes on working class folks.
[03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:45.240]  I mean, they're raising taxes on the poorest people in America that are the working poor.
[03:48:45.240 --> 03:48:48.180]  That's pretty cold blooded, isn't it, when you claim you're this big communist that wants
[03:48:48.180 --> 03:48:49.180]  to help everybody.
[03:48:49.180 --> 03:48:50.180]  That's true.
[03:48:50.180 --> 03:48:55.600]  And another thing I noticed too, as I'm an African American, and you get an action card,
[03:48:55.600 --> 03:48:57.240]  he'll tell you the same thing.
[03:48:57.240 --> 03:49:01.280]  The more educated black people have a hard time believing it, cuz they've been in college
[03:49:01.280 --> 03:49:02.280]  and stuff.
[03:49:02.280 --> 03:49:06.000]  But in the same way, look, look, look, these educated idiot yuppies, I don't care what
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:07.600]  color they are, are dumb.
[03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:11.400]  They won't listen to facts, cuz they're too busy laughing at you, cuz they're so smart.
[03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:15.080]  I know, it's a joke, I appreciate your call, my friend.
[03:49:15.080 --> 03:49:17.920]  Let's talk to Joseph in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:49:17.920 --> 03:49:22.240]  Hey, Alex, I've been listening to you for a while.
[03:49:22.240 --> 03:49:27.040]  The question is, does everybody realize that history is repeating itself?
[03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:28.920]  A lot of people do, that's why I'm freaking out.
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:33.960]  We are repeating history, we're in trouble.
[03:49:33.960 --> 03:49:37.880]  You need to actually, the one thing that you need to realize is that he's gonna present
[03:49:37.880 --> 03:49:39.880]  four arguments.
[03:49:39.880 --> 03:49:44.080]  The four arguments are gonna run along the political, which they're already doing.
[03:49:44.080 --> 03:49:47.400]  The social with the children that he parades out.
[03:49:47.400 --> 03:49:51.240]  You watch, next thing he's gonna come out with, and they're gonna cherry pick the data,
[03:49:51.240 --> 03:49:54.200]  is gonna be medical and economic.
[03:49:54.200 --> 03:49:56.800]  No, he's already doing that.
[03:49:56.800 --> 03:50:01.840]  He's gonna turn Obamacare into a funding mechanism for gun grabbing, because Obamacare is written
[03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:04.360]  to where he can do anything he wants.
[03:50:04.360 --> 03:50:11.120]  Yep, but history's repeating itself, and it seems whenever there's a new bad thing, right
[03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:16.760]  now guns with a new smoking, they're bad, according to the government.
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:21.560]  They break out these four arguments, and the only way to fight them is basically say, quit
[03:50:21.560 --> 03:50:24.400]  cherry picking the data, let me see the entire report.
[03:50:24.400 --> 03:50:27.040]  Well, it's more than that, I got a right to defend myself.
[03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:31.400]  I don't care what you say, you're not getting my gun, cuz I'm not guilty for what somebody
[03:50:31.400 --> 03:50:32.400]  else did.
[03:50:32.400 --> 03:50:37.840]  That, and do they honestly think, do the people in New York, these legislators in New York
[03:50:37.840 --> 03:50:42.560]  who passed all these gun control laws, do they honestly think criminals are so stupid
[03:50:42.560 --> 03:50:46.880]  that they're going to be stuck in getting guns from the street?
[03:50:46.880 --> 03:50:49.400]  No, they're gonna go across state lines.
[03:50:49.400 --> 03:50:51.080]  The criminals are gonna rejoice.
[03:50:51.080 --> 03:50:55.640]  I mean, the criminals are on the run right now, because they're getting their butt shot
[03:50:55.640 --> 03:50:57.040]  off by the police and the citizens.
[03:50:57.040 --> 03:51:03.200]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[03:51:03.200 --> 03:51:08.720]  You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa, where a nicely furnished cabin

[03:53:00.760 --> 03:53:01.760]  My name is Steven Heuer.
[03:53:01.760 --> 03:53:05.880]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions
[03:53:05.880 --> 03:53:09.200]  have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[03:53:09.200 --> 03:53:13.040]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious
[03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:17.560]  matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting
[03:53:17.560 --> 03:53:21.240]  one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[03:53:21.240 --> 03:53:25.640]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione
[03:53:25.640 --> 03:53:26.640]  production.
[03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:30.640]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[03:53:30.640 --> 03:53:35.400]  I got him on One World Way, and in two months, his constipation is gone.
[03:53:35.400 --> 03:53:39.520]  He has become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has
[03:53:39.520 --> 03:53:40.520]  made his first friend.
[03:53:40.520 --> 03:53:44.680]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[03:53:44.680 --> 03:53:49.600]  You could offer him a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.
[03:53:49.600 --> 03:54:10.800]  Go to oneworldway.com, that's oneworldway.com, or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.
[03:54:19.600 --> 03:54:27.000]  We're gonna have a big info wars nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:30.200]  You can get 11 memberships for the price of one.
[03:54:30.200 --> 03:54:35.400]  Just go create the username passcode and share it with people, that's how we get the word
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:36.400]  out more.
[03:54:36.400 --> 03:54:40.840]  Yeah, no more Mr. Nice Guy, the globalists are dropping the hammer because they're behind
[03:54:40.840 --> 03:54:44.820]  schedule and they've got to kill our gun culture.
[03:54:44.820 --> 03:54:50.880]  It's very positive that they're being this nasty, and it really shows we're hurting them.
[03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:54.400]  And so they're gonna try to get their legislation through without ever really admitting, here's
[03:54:54.400 --> 03:54:57.480]  a little kid, I don't want your guns, well, the bill says it.
[03:54:57.480 --> 03:55:02.240]  Here's a little kid, hey, your Obamacare has death panels, no, it doesn't, yeah, it's right
[03:55:02.240 --> 03:55:03.240]  here in subsections.
[03:55:03.240 --> 03:55:04.240]  Shut up, racist.
[03:55:04.240 --> 03:55:09.920]  I remember actually watching Chris Matthews call people racist, and they'd be like, I
[03:55:09.920 --> 03:55:12.480]  see you are, you're racist.
[03:55:12.480 --> 03:55:14.840]  How does not wanting death panels mean I'm racist?
[03:55:14.840 --> 03:55:19.720]  Well, of course a racist wouldn't say they were racist, I mean, it's, look, little kids
[03:55:19.720 --> 03:55:20.720]  turn on your guns.
[03:55:20.720 --> 03:55:29.440]  The little kids want them turned in, don't worry, Jimmy, I'll get the guns.
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:37.440]  I mean, it's so transparent, Obama takes our tax money and wages war against us and gives
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:38.440]  it to foreign banks.
[03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:42.800]  And then I try to sell t-shirts like the new come and take it one to fund my media operation.
[03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:46.320]  And yeah, there's evil pro gun people that make money.
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:48.440]  And him and Biden are like, that's really terrible.
[03:55:48.440 --> 03:55:51.640]  Yeah, we didn't make it out of insider trading like you and Dianne Feinstein.
[03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:54.320]  Yeah, Biden, gosh, she's incredible.
[03:55:54.320 --> 03:55:57.440]  Jim in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:55:57.440 --> 03:56:02.400]  Hey, mega dittos, Alex, if you're not fan of me before the end of this, ask me about
[03:56:02.400 --> 03:56:05.440]  the Paris Morgan thing, I have some constructive criticism.
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:09.440]  But the reason I called, I think regarding the Second Amendment, we could clear up all
[03:56:09.440 --> 03:56:13.520]  the confusion of terms, intent, and reason if everybody would just go get a copy of Unintended
[03:56:13.520 --> 03:56:15.680]  Consequences and read it cover to cover.
[03:56:15.680 --> 03:56:17.000]  Yeah, it's an excellent book.
[03:56:17.000 --> 03:56:18.000]  It's an excellent book.
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:22.720]  And I think later I'm gonna mail my copy to Barry Hussein, highlight it, might get me
[03:56:22.720 --> 03:56:24.360]  killed but might be worth it.
[03:56:24.360 --> 03:56:30.400]  But this whole discussion about 1776 and we're all gonna go have a gun battle in the street
[03:56:30.400 --> 03:56:36.680]  and stuff, before we get to that point, it seems to me that it would be smart by trying
[03:56:36.680 --> 03:56:39.640]  the intelligent approach first.
[03:56:39.640 --> 03:56:43.680]  But if everybody that went out and bought guns and bought ammo and had background checks
[03:56:43.680 --> 03:56:49.040]  and did all that stuff, would just stop paying their taxes, most of these problems would
[03:56:49.040 --> 03:56:50.040]  go away.
[03:56:50.040 --> 03:56:51.240]  Hey, brother, let's get something straight.
[03:56:51.240 --> 03:56:53.560]  I'm trying to stop the Civil War.
[03:56:53.560 --> 03:56:56.840]  Believe me, I'm gonna be the first person killed or locked up.
[03:56:56.840 --> 03:56:59.200]  I don't want this, okay?
[03:56:59.200 --> 03:57:03.760]  I'm saying they want to get it started while having kids around them going, we just wanna
[03:57:03.760 --> 03:57:05.040]  be reasonable.
[03:57:05.040 --> 03:57:06.840]  I'm telling you, we're in danger.
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:07.840]  What's your constructive criticism?
[03:57:07.840 --> 03:57:08.840]  Okay, I'll skip there at some point.
[03:57:08.840 --> 03:57:09.840]  But constructive criticism, I'm Paris Morgan.
[03:57:09.840 --> 03:57:10.840]  You were great.
[03:57:10.840 --> 03:57:11.840]  I love you.
[03:57:11.840 --> 03:57:12.840]  You're preaching to the choir.
[03:57:12.840 --> 03:57:13.840]  But I'm not the guy when you go on Paris Morgan, you should be talking to, you should be talking
[03:57:13.840 --> 03:57:14.840]  to my mom and dad and my neighbors and whoever.
[03:57:14.840 --> 03:57:18.440]  I tried to share with other people and they couldn't get past the tone and the indignation,
[03:57:18.440 --> 03:57:19.440]  which I totally get this.
[03:57:19.440 --> 03:57:31.000]  Totally justified.
[03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:34.760]  But I think you need to put on a little bit of a dog and pony show to get a few more people
[03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:35.760]  over on your side.
[03:57:35.760 --> 03:57:40.320]  You've already won the Over a Marty list and I'm already calling your show.
[03:57:40.320 --> 03:57:42.320]  I'm not the target audience when you go on Paris Morgan.
[03:57:42.320 --> 03:57:47.280]  It's the little old lady who sits and drinks the Kool-Aid all day that you need to be kind
[03:57:47.280 --> 03:57:48.280]  of that-
[03:57:48.280 --> 03:57:51.880]  Let me get to a certain point, but I found if you slap them upside the head, down the
[03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:53.160]  road they wake up.
[03:57:53.160 --> 03:57:54.160]  It's like a delayed action.
[03:57:54.160 --> 03:57:55.760]  And I didn't even do that on purpose.
[03:57:55.760 --> 03:57:58.520]  I just got mad at the sniveling lying.
[03:57:58.520 --> 03:58:01.400]  Christ overturned the tables and beat the money changers.
[03:58:01.400 --> 03:58:04.260]  Paul Revere rode around saying get your weapons and shoot people.
[03:58:04.260 --> 03:58:05.260]  I'm not doing any of that.
[03:58:05.260 --> 03:58:06.540]  I didn't overturn the table.
[03:58:06.540 --> 03:58:08.300]  I'm not saying shoot people.
[03:58:08.300 --> 03:58:13.360]  I'm saying look, look, you want my guns, you little tyrant, okay?
[03:58:13.360 --> 03:58:14.900]  And I'm sick of you.
[03:58:14.900 --> 03:58:18.240]  And I'm sick of your propaganda, all right?
[03:58:18.240 --> 03:58:23.640]  Now, if you'd like to learn more, we'll be covering all this tonight, seven o'clock central.
[03:58:23.640 --> 03:58:28.080]  We take you now to Klandathu, where our forces are winning an incredible battle against the
[03:58:28.080 --> 03:58:29.080]  Obamanoids.
[03:58:29.080 --> 03:58:30.800]  Alex Jones signing off.
[03:58:30.800 --> 03:58:34.520]  That's a Starship Troopers plug there.
[03:58:34.520 --> 03:58:48.480]  And I'm not going crazy before the New York Times talks about Klandathu.
