[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:30.520]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.520 --> 00:37.420]  Wow I tuned into the big local morning talk show and I thought it was Alex
[00:37.420 --> 00:42.840]  Jones on the air so I called in and they put me right on air and they just
[00:42.840 --> 00:46.680]  basically totally agree with me and told me I've been right all these years and
[00:46.680 --> 00:51.560]  that happens with so many radio shows that would criticize us in the past
[00:51.560 --> 00:58.200]  because people now see that what we warned of is unfolding foreign interest
[00:58.200 --> 01:04.440]  of hijacked the federal government and they are using our tax money against us
[01:04.440 --> 01:07.680]  to turn the United States and the same things being done in every other
[01:07.680 --> 01:15.240]  industrialized country into a classical hardcore in-your-face tyranny and what's
[01:15.240 --> 01:18.800]  really waking people up is the announcement of 30,000 drones in the
[01:18.800 --> 01:24.120]  next decade to be phased in and watching national news like Fox News were there
[01:24.120 --> 01:28.720]  that's right is that potting soil explosives homeland security is going to

[08:09.840 --> 08:30.160]  Shibu Edmonds who was a FBI translator who on the day of 9-11 the day
[08:30.160 --> 08:38.040]  before 9-11 heard the CIA commanding Al Qaeda she is going to be joining us
[08:38.040 --> 08:44.040]  she's broken her gag order and written a book and we're going to be talking to
[08:44.040 --> 08:53.080]  Shibu Edmonds with us in years coming up today in the third hour and of course
[08:53.080 --> 08:59.840]  she also heard them running sex slaves and weapons that's what these criminals
[08:59.840 --> 09:03.960]  do and our naivete and not realizing our government was taken over a long time
[09:03.960 --> 09:11.880]  ago by totally ruthless foreign banks until we realize that we don't have any
[09:11.880 --> 09:15.840]  hope of ever turning this around. Things are just going to get progressively worse
[09:15.840 --> 09:22.840]  until we have that collective reawakening that our forebears had and if we
[09:22.840 --> 09:30.840]  don't it is a eugenics nightmare that is where the tunnel basically ends okay
[09:30.840 --> 09:37.040]  let me just give you some of the headlines here big news today military
[09:37.040 --> 09:43.160]  detention law blocked by New York judge that's the NDAA saying the military can
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.920]  secretly arrest you secretly disappear you and Obama went forward and said kill
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.840]  you that's US citizens and enforcement of that has been blocked thanks to the
[09:52.840 --> 09:57.720]  lawsuit by Chris Hedges the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who we're going
[09:57.720 --> 10:01.520]  to get back on the show we got him on when he first filed that a few months
[10:01.520 --> 10:06.680]  ago and again this is so immoral that even if the courts later end up saying
[10:06.680 --> 10:14.800]  this is okay it shows that this is a confession of their abject evil you see
[10:14.800 --> 10:20.840]  as things get worse and worse it's only going to illustrate to people that the
[10:20.840 --> 10:28.080]  bad guys have taken over so there is that report also we're going to get into
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.480]  whites account for under half of births in the US whites really are a minority
[10:32.480 --> 10:36.360]  overall and when there's no more white people left you won't have white folks
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.640]  to kick around anymore that's a joke from Nixon you won't have tricky dick to
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.240]  kick around anymore and again I see how race politics is used to control people
[10:45.240 --> 10:49.560]  people are people it doesn't matter people that have been filled with hatred
[10:49.560 --> 10:53.320]  for you whether you're black or white or Hispanic or whatever it is you still
[10:53.320 --> 10:57.880]  got to deal with that and I am just so sick of hearing how white people cause
[10:57.880 --> 11:01.800]  all the problems in the world no evil white people because they've been smart
[11:01.800 --> 11:08.920]  and barbaric have been dominant for a long time globally endless wars with
[11:08.920 --> 11:13.760]  each other but every other group of humans enslave kill and and and go after
[11:13.760 --> 11:18.520]  each other but the big mega bankers Ford Foundation others they sell this idea
[11:18.520 --> 11:23.000]  of white guilt and whites are bad so they can organize other groups into
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.240]  political armies under their control while making whites guilty to say hey
[11:27.240 --> 11:30.920]  go for government-run health care or racist that's what MSNBC said as a
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.880]  talking point you're like what does that do with being racist well you don't be
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.320]  racist oh a take vaccines or you're sometimes extremist or racist don't
[11:40.320 --> 11:44.800]  criticize Obama or you're a racist this is how they do it and so you you should
[11:44.800 --> 11:50.560]  learn to not be guilty when you've done nothing wrong and that goes for
[11:50.560 --> 11:53.320]  everybody this whole environmental movement has nothing to do with the
[11:53.320 --> 11:57.040]  environment it's all about having guilt thinking you're bad that's an across the
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.440]  board system that we're all trash humans are trash we believe we're trash we
[12:02.440 --> 12:05.320]  act like trash we roll over to the globalist who want us out of the way
[12:05.320 --> 12:08.680]  they've stolen the planet through fraud they want us dead and whether you're
[12:08.680 --> 12:15.480]  black white Hispanic Asian polka dotted whatever you are the globalist want you

[12:51.160 --> 12:54.360]  building widgets you know in military see the new economy is not going to be
[12:54.360 --> 13:00.080]  just widgets from China it's going to be drones surveillance weapons for the
[13:00.080 --> 13:05.360]  globalist you're not going to have police helicopters in the sky soon because
[13:05.360 --> 13:09.600]  those aren't going to be rated as safe I saw this over the weekend you know they
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.800]  come out with a Friday edition of USA Today and then it's the weekend edition
[13:15.800 --> 13:20.560]  and I was at the beach with the family save the newspaper we got home at nine

[14:13.760 --> 14:16.800]  you won't be allowed to have a car you might be able to share a car with your
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.400]  neighborhood this is the plantopolis I mean and they say there look that's what
[14:22.400 --> 14:27.240]  the control grid is it's shutting off the resources and the only jobs are gonna

[24:03.640 --> 24:08.240]  I already digressed off into drones but we're gonna be covering it coming up in
[24:08.240 --> 24:12.000]  the next segment because people are finally concerned about it I mean I
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.320]  remember reading Pentagon public statements 15 years ago that most the
[24:17.320 --> 24:21.280]  Air Force by 2012 more than half of it will be converted over to drones they've
[24:21.280 --> 24:27.680]  now done that they've got something like 15,000 predators last time I checked
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.000]  the Air Force does and they're talking about doubling that even the
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.320]  transports are gonna be remote control this gives the technocrats power over
[24:35.320 --> 24:40.280]  everything and cuts human decisions out all these science fiction movies where
[24:40.280 --> 24:44.520]  humans go out to space no it's gonna be robots and the elite believe they're
[24:44.520 --> 24:47.360]  gonna merge with them and they're building the technocracy in that
[24:47.360 --> 24:52.480]  direction whether that's true or not I should break down their master plan more
[24:52.480 --> 24:57.480]  often it's so big side issue I'm gonna come back after the break spy drone
[24:57.480 --> 25:02.360]  almost causes mid-air collision with jet over Denver FAA investigating
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.680]  extremely dangerous incident and it's the drone that did it but don't worry
[25:06.680 --> 25:10.280]  they're going to come out and say watch in the future just like they are with
[25:10.280 --> 25:16.360]  cars now the answer is make the aircraft remote control with a ceremonial pilot
[25:16.360 --> 25:22.880]  to sit there and mind it in case there's a problem taking humans out of the
[25:22.880 --> 25:28.600]  equation so that they can be synced with the drones that's another system of
[25:28.600 --> 25:32.320]  problem-reaction solution when you're gonna have 30,000 in the skies and then
[25:32.320 --> 25:35.760]  this story is up at Drudge reporter was last night in this morning judge
[25:35.760 --> 25:41.200]  Napolitano first patriot to shoot down a government spy drone will be a hero
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.680]  blast illegal use of plastic drones the spying Americans in their backyards we
[25:45.680 --> 25:49.000]  got two different clips I'm gonna play because he's absolutely on target but in
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.240]  the first part of the Fox News clips because they're both up there I'm not
[25:51.240 --> 25:56.200]  gonna play that one don't have time they're like in the newscast piece it's
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.080]  so wonderful watching you in your backyard in case you do something are
[26:00.080 --> 26:04.720]  those potted plants really bombs is that potting soil a bomb we need to be
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.000]  watched to keep us safe from Tim McVeigh all of you will be watched and then they
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.760]  cut to the Shepherd Smith and then and then Napolitano I mean it's amazing how
[26:14.760 --> 26:19.200]  they push this stuff but then you have the judge on to say it's wrong
[26:19.200 --> 26:24.720]  continuing the military's involved it's totally illegal we're gonna be breaking

[33:46.280 --> 33:50.720]  which are confirmed to be targeting whitey but hey what's wrong with that
[33:50.720 --> 33:54.160]  media said it was good all part of trying to get people divided in this

[33:59.560 --> 34:05.280]  here is French news agency continuing of good news military detention law blocked
[34:05.280 --> 34:10.120]  by New York judge the NDAA of course they never follow what the judges say
[34:10.120 --> 34:15.080]  anyways I've seen that for a while prominent activists backs Occupy
[34:15.080 --> 34:19.720]  Bilderberg campaign that we've launched and a lot of folks are coming the 31st
[34:19.720 --> 34:25.360]  of this month or the third or so there in Chantilly Virginia confronting the
[34:25.360 --> 34:29.920]  the real problem and you know this big activist I'll tell you about him later
[34:29.920 --> 34:35.760]  it's at top of info wars calm David Swanson who helped break the Downing
[34:35.760 --> 34:39.760]  Street memo information seen as a cost 11 the left he goes why don't we go
[34:39.760 --> 34:46.080]  protest the big you know NATO summits G20s why don't we go protest the real
[34:46.080 --> 34:51.480]  elite meeting in secret because the left always said that didn't exist they
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.680]  want you to believe it's just Republicans and Democrats Tory Labor left
[34:55.680 --> 35:00.240]  right not that both sides are controlled at that level I mean look at how Obama
[35:00.240 --> 35:05.280]  is financed by the very same people financing Mitt Romney the company Mitt
[35:05.280 --> 35:11.080]  Romney ran and basically controlled and partially owned Bain Capital is giving
[35:11.080 --> 35:15.200]  money to Obama double the amount given to Mitt Romney and Mitt Romney still
[35:15.200 --> 35:22.040]  owns part of it I mean it's a joke they're stealing tens of trillions of
[35:22.040 --> 35:27.240]  dollars and then using your money to pay for 30,000 drones TSA highway
[35:27.240 --> 35:32.800]  checkpoints all these weapons systems for us the criminals and they are getting
[35:32.800 --> 35:38.960]  all the police stirred up in a frenzy against us it's just so ridiculous that
[35:38.960 --> 35:43.280]  this is happening but first I want to get into this report it's at info wars
[35:43.280 --> 35:49.040]  dot com originating with Mike Adams a natural news dot com LA County health
[35:49.040 --> 35:53.880]  enforcers conduct door-to-door raw milk confiscation operations they of course
[35:53.880 --> 36:03.960]  have rated long-standing raw milk sellers pastures and they've gotten their
[36:03.960 --> 36:10.000]  customer list and are going door-to-door this is confirmed demanding the fresh
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.960]  real milk back now again 60 years ago all you could get was raw milk they
[36:13.960 --> 36:16.880]  started boiling it so they could feed you the blood and pus and overwork cows
[36:16.880 --> 36:22.000]  that their udders produce with real milky it lasts longer by the way than
[36:22.000 --> 36:27.600]  the pasteurized but if there's any impurities you can't sell it I mean
[36:27.600 --> 36:30.360]  you'll immediately find out who's doing good milk and then statistically it's
[36:30.360 --> 36:34.640]  very very low problems but it's kind of like they want to have PCs and disease
[36:34.640 --> 36:37.880]  on the chicken and beef so they spray up with live viruses now that quote eat the
[36:37.880 --> 36:44.120]  bacteria think I'm joking look up viral spray put on me ABC MSNBC in fact put
[36:44.120 --> 36:47.880]  that on screen folks won't believe it that was approved six years ago causing
[36:47.880 --> 36:54.480]  massive gut problems because the virus is just incredible it's a it's a
[36:54.480 --> 36:57.960]  vaccine they spray and in the big giant tanks where they make it there's other
[36:57.960 --> 37:03.960]  viruses and micro plasms in there so enjoy your Crohn's leaky gut all of

[37:41.760 --> 37:48.480]  but that's not a problem LA County health enforcers conduct door-to-door raw
[37:48.480 --> 37:53.200]  milk confiscation operations and they say we're coming in and force their way
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.280]  in illegally but hey who needs that you know I mean look imagine they come to

[38:23.000 --> 38:26.560]  they were the ones that would come grab you no judge no jury and then bring you
[38:26.560 --> 38:30.200]  before a fake family court they just set up and have a eugenicist I've played the
[38:30.200 --> 38:36.080]  newsreels here say well your brother is mentally ill so that means you are your
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.600]  unfit I order you sterilized and they whack the gavel that's an end game
[38:42.600 --> 38:52.120]  blueprint for global enslavement and they take you away and cut out your

[39:05.960 --> 39:11.360]  process because you might get a little soft kill you know complication on top
[39:11.360 --> 39:14.560]  of it how I continue it you know of the mother that's the best part with the UN
[39:14.560 --> 39:17.560]  program of the tetanus shots because you don't just cause a second trimester
[39:17.560 --> 39:21.320]  abortion for the rest of woman's life when you give them the tetanus shot added
[39:21.320 --> 39:25.760]  to the female hormone causing an army in response to it you also then get a good
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.200]  soft kill ratio because it causes all sorts of inflammation polyps cyst and
[39:30.200 --> 39:41.800]  tumors in the uterus but especially in the ovaries very loving of very good
[39:41.800 --> 39:46.520]  people but they're nice the drones are good and the TSA on the streets groping
[39:46.520 --> 39:50.560]  people violate in the fourth and tenth amendment that's good too and again I
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.840]  shouldn't be so extreme LA County health enforcers conduct door-to-door raw
[39:55.840 --> 39:59.680]  milk confiscation operations you can read the whole article LA County health
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.280]  enforcers go door-to-door demanding or fresh milk it's kind of like in New
[40:04.280 --> 40:08.200]  Mexico a few months ago you know they had an annual thing where the neighbors
[40:08.200 --> 40:11.760]  look in the country got together and had a big cookout less than 100 people they
[40:11.760 --> 40:14.840]  brought their potatoes and tomatoes and you get there in the morning chop them up
[40:14.840 --> 40:19.120]  you know by lunch have a snack and then at dinner have this big feast you know
[40:19.120 --> 40:23.200]  beef chicken all off their own farms and then you get the homemade ice cream
[40:23.200 --> 40:28.240]  going churn in that I mean this is just standard where my folks are from my
[40:28.240 --> 40:34.120]  dad's from northeast Texas and that's what we always did that culture is
[40:34.120 --> 40:37.600]  pretty much dead now that doesn't happen everybody buys the stuff at Walmart and
[40:37.600 --> 40:41.800]  we all eat the GMO together there I'm well not really joking you know I guess
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.120]  somebody brings in some peas or some collard greens and you know maybe maybe
[40:46.120 --> 40:49.240]  some venison or something but you know mainly it's it's with Walmart purchase
[40:49.240 --> 40:52.720]  stuff so that culture is dead and I mean that's how I grew up going to grandma's
[40:52.720 --> 40:55.640]  and you know we go to somebody else's house or neighbors would come over you
[40:55.640 --> 41:01.440]  have like 30 people there all this food people playing 42 playing cards you know
[41:01.440 --> 41:08.600]  hanging out not even get some square dancing going oh yeah it's all dead it's
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.880]  all gone we get to worship homeland security now that's the new patriotism
[41:12.880 --> 41:19.640]  and the people are trying to resurrect this the foodies the they're mainly
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.920]  doctors and executives most of I've been out in these communities outside
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.480]  Austin the average person probably makes $300,000 and they've gotten and they
[41:28.480 --> 41:33.440]  know what's going on and I think most of them are reformed eugenicist
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.120]  establishment liberals and and they're all over in every community they're all
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.040]  out there just with their kids trying to be decent trying to have a co-op with
[41:42.040 --> 41:45.400]  their own cows and stuff and you know just having a good wholesome life and

[44:43.240 --> 44:47.880]  California the regulatory agencies just say how long Obama says well there's no
[44:47.880 --> 44:51.320]  law but I'm gonna order power plants not owned by my buddy shut down and
[44:51.320 --> 44:55.160]  massively increase your coal power prices to the point of there's gonna be
[44:55.160 --> 44:58.360]  blackouts everywhere on top of it because you're gonna pay more for less and
[44:58.360 --> 45:00.840]  we're gonna shut down your local reservoirs and make you buy it from
[45:00.840 --> 45:04.360]  other companies and there's no law we're gonna do it and we're gonna make you

[45:07.960 --> 45:11.520]  countries that's on record but but again we have your best interests in
[45:11.520 --> 45:15.040]  heart we're gonna get you American jobs Obama why don't America's got an
[45:15.040 --> 45:18.520]  incredible engine of liberty and freedom and ingenuity we're gonna get back on
[45:18.520 --> 45:21.560]  our feet while he's doing everything they can to shut us down and then in
[45:21.560 --> 45:26.840]  their own documents saying post-industrial world global poverty is what's needed and
[45:26.840 --> 45:29.240]  your high school daughters being brainwashed about the world while I
[45:29.240 --> 45:34.040]  fund it was set up so they could have poaching of you know animals in Africa
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.680]  as a front to run all sorts of scams for Prince Bernhard the head of the
[45:38.680 --> 45:41.840]  Bilderberg groups had to step down as chairman caught shipping guns and weapons
[45:41.840 --> 45:46.960]  and then gold mining operations in the Congo but these are nice people though
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.680]  these are really good people and they said they want you poor that's out of
[45:52.680 --> 45:55.000]  one side of their mouth yeah we're gonna make you poor so we can do whatever we
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.040]  want to you oh but we're gonna pay to ship General Motors overseas just because
[45:58.040 --> 46:03.120]  we care about you anyways I want to commit the crime of this a crime in well
[46:03.120 --> 46:07.720]  it's not a crime but doesn't matter it's not illegal than any state to spank your
[46:07.720 --> 46:12.800]  children it's not look it up but they take children every day for it it's not
[46:12.800 --> 46:16.320]  illegal to not take vaccines they take kids every day for not doing it because
[46:16.320 --> 46:19.760]  they've got enforcers and they got bureaucrats and they got family courts
[46:19.760 --> 46:23.720]  that aren't real courts set up by the eugenicist 100 years ago literally 100
[46:23.720 --> 46:27.240]  years ago for they can do whatever they want they've got armies of little
[46:27.240 --> 46:30.640]  control freaks who'll tell you it's my administrative privilege to stick my
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.440]  hands down your pants law says I can't do this but I'm God and I'm gonna
[46:35.440 --> 46:39.040]  exercise this power now get ready and if you give me a problem we're gonna take
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.480]  in the private room and then the lip licking begins now here we go here's
[46:44.480 --> 46:50.880]  the crime this is milk from outside Austin Texas Molten Texas about to
[46:50.880 --> 46:57.080]  commit a serious evilness oh my gosh part of trying to get healthy after years
[46:57.080 --> 47:00.400]  of just working so hard not caring about myself again I'd be killed any day I
[47:00.400 --> 47:03.920]  just got to where I was totally unhealthy until my buddy Tommy Pilata said
[47:03.920 --> 47:07.320]  you know what because you because you don't care if you die you're already
[47:07.320 --> 47:11.500]  basically killing yourself won't you stop smoking those cigarettes won't you
[47:11.500 --> 47:15.600]  stop drinking and why don't you lose weight and exercise I was about five
[47:15.600 --> 47:19.720]  years ago I never really got all the way into it but I quit smoking and it
[47:19.720 --> 47:23.880]  spoke a lot but here in the air quit smoking cigars basically cut back on
[47:23.880 --> 47:28.760]  drinking to almost nothing and started exercising but it wasn't like I got the
[47:28.760 --> 47:33.400]  proper nutrition the proper gut flora not a better probiotic out there than
[47:33.400 --> 47:38.520]  raw milk allergies got better when I started doing this because the cows are
[47:38.520 --> 47:48.520]  eating the local flora all of it and here I am I've got some whey in there
[47:49.160 --> 47:55.840]  uh-oh I'm committing a hardcore crime you know we even compromised our day
[47:55.840 --> 47:58.760]  Savetta when we had him here in studio I had some of this and he thought it was
[47:58.760 --> 48:02.160]  a joke they're arresting people for raw milk I said here have some and he saw
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.520]  me drink it so he drank it part of his anthropology you know he's with the
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.360]  natives locally assessing me and but also you know keeping friends close

[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:18.680]  talk to James in Florida James you're first up at bat today yes I found
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.520]  something online and I haven't seen it on your website yet it's an executive
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:30.640]  order that was given out by Barack Obama yesterday on May 16th it says blocking
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:37.400]  property of persons threatening the peace security or stability of Yemen and
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.440]  then and then if you give money to some mainline aid group or something and then
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.240]  they later claim they were aiding somebody who was aiding a terrorist I
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.360]  mean they've said with the Coney 2012 thing with that executive order that
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.200]  anywhere in Africa if they claim you're aiding someone who might be aiding who
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.320]  might know somebody that did aid Coney especially anybody on the planet that
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.400]  you know you bought a box of roses literally a lot of roses come out of
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.240]  Central Africa in England they're saying they might put you on a list and yes I
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.960]  was aware of that that guys print me that article I didn't see that in my
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.000]  stack it might be there I might have missed it what do you think of the
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.240]  other big order I didn't mention where they want a ex-patriot act that if you
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.120]  try to leave the US they'll never let you return if you try to leave with your
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.560]  money criminal unconstitutional these words come to mind or Bilderberg
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:34.520]  global mafia comes to mind the thing about this executive order that
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.920]  concerns me is it says I hereby declare national emergency to deal with that
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:46.800]  threat and paragraph two it is it is a big deal that's my point people think
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.560]  I'm exaggerating how bad it is I can't even keep track of it anymore sir it's
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.960]  it's it is insane how fast their takeover is taking place because they're
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.360]  getting ready to fully implode things and poses saviors that's gonna be the
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.520]  sickest part when the depression gets really bad is having to watch the
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.520]  perpetrators be praised as the saviors it just really gets old I have one
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:14.360]  additional comment and that info wars thing in the background he's on
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.440]  YouTube is really cool but I really liked the Patrick McGowan prisoner picture
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:25.640]  he had before I'm sorry they were cutting into my ear saying something what
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:32.440]  did you just say I said this is for Paul Paul Joseph Watson that info wars
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.040]  thing he has behind him when he's on Skype is cool but I like the Patrick
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.040]  McGowan prisoner picture better well I wanted a big printout that covered the
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.480]  whole wall behind him and somehow he got miniaturized it's kind of like spinal
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.960]  tap where they want stone hinge around them like 20 feet tall instead they're

[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:25.240]  the IRS claims the private collection agency of the private fellow reserve if
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.640]  the IRS shares you owe the federal reserve money no judge no jury just like
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.720]  they seize your bank account your passport is deactivated that's the whole
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.720]  point of the chip in them this has been a long-term plan that systems going in
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.920]  worldwide they're trying to pass that right now that's right out of Nazi
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:48.560]  Germany right out of Soviet Russia on top of that they are now announcing good
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.600]  old Chuck E. Schumer now the big multi-billionaires they're all above the
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.480]  law offshore they don't pay taxes like General Electric and the rest of them
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.880]  that you pay banker bailouts to ship that what's left of the factories of China in
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.280]  the case of General Motors never forget that that's how much they want you to
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.880]  have jobs because they're good people folks always say oh they're just idiots
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.480]  in government oh yeah they're running things and have dumbed everybody down
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.120]  and gotten away with poisoning our food and water and admitted they do and in
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.960]  public memos at the Rockefeller Foundation and they're just running
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.800]  pretty much the whole world oh yeah they're incompetent idiots yeah yeah
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.240]  they're incompetent no they make the bureaucracy incompetent where the
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:32.320]  rubber meets the road so you can't ever get anywhere and get lost in a minotaur
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:41.040]  maze that maze was designed by the big brains the brain bugs the New World Order
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:47.040]  who hated humanity so much they worked real hard to make sure they win and the
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.240]  winning means killing you as every ancient culture did to those that they'd
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.600]  had conflict with it was some little wimpy tribe that they beat easily they
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.320]  just take them as slaves but if it was an old enemy that they'd almost lost to
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:06.560]  we're all to be put to the sword just as the Romans would do if someone resisted
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.240]  them just as the Israelites would do if you resisted them we're all being put to
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.560]  the sword our minds right now our bodies but we will be physically put to the
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:19.320]  sword and that is the hardcore victory in their eyes in the enemy's eyes as they
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.680]  just press their murderous operation so hardcore so vicious so complete so total
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.400]  so wicked that the average person can't grasp the full magnitude of the
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:39.600]  exterminism that we're under the slow creeping take their time take down of
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.960]  everything the family's almost gone common sense is almost gone the defense
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.240]  system is dropping soon it'll be automated robots and drones and full
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.080]  control tiny technocracy it'll only be technician servicing the
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:11:02.000]  technocracy a total system of surveillance and then the next controlled
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.840]  bio weapon release that they'll say terrorists did they'll use that to clamp
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.920]  down anymore they'll use that to clamp down even more and set up the
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.040]  metropolis planopolis and then once that's in place they'll roll out the
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.160]  next phase probably targeting the third world first I predict they'll kill over
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.760]  90% of Africa in one month then they're gonna hit Asia then they're going to hit
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:29.880]  Latin America then they're going to hit the West oh I know I'm that guy that
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.480]  said there'd be drones in the skies and secret arrest and reeducation camps I
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.680]  have their plan it's public
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.800]  it's in pieces but it's like a perfect jigsaw puzzle you put together it's like
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:52.720]  whoa you stand back you stagger you get chills the full magnitude hits you it's
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:59.280]  otherworldly it makes you really believe in the devil because I'm gonna tell you
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.880]  there are a lot of smart people a lot of wicked powerful people out there but
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:08.400]  this is the mystery of evil this is manipulated by a spiritual force that
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.000]  ties it together it has its own providence its own manifest destiny of
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.840]  evil but just as Nineveh was reprieved and as we see this same thing throughout
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.480]  history if we resist evil and stand up against it and repent that doesn't mean
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:28.920]  one of these government-run churches they took those over first but if we get
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:34.200]  our hearts right and just choose the side of good and say I want to be good I
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.240]  want to be loving you will be filled with courage and the spirit of resistance
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:48.480]  against tyranny and to overcome it and you will be guided you can call it your
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.440]  instincts you can call it your survival instinct your common sense I've been
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.880]  guided through my entire life to be where I am now I didn't understand that
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:02.400]  when I was young but some of God's greatest blessings some of God's greatest
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.560]  gifts are unanswered prayers to quote Garth Brooks
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:13.400]  the good things that have happened to me but the bad things or all nothing but
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:20.560]  a preparation you've got a decision to make my friends I mean look at these
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.520]  articles here I just played to you where the news is saying Mercury is good for
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.080]  your children's brains here's another one BBC National Health Service should
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.800]  consider giving statins to healthy people and they say they're gonna make you
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.520]  take it that's what government health care is folks statins literally eat the
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:43.720]  brain literally rot holes in it it gives you scurvy of the brain that's the
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.200]  best way to describe it for the medical doctors I've talked to the it of the
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:56.600]  solid part 70% or so is water of the solid part over 90% is cholesterol it
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:04.560]  is an electrochemical oil-based computer it's electrochemical and it is it
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.440]  makes fluoride look like mother's milk
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:19.880]  oh have you read what's in the formula have you read what's in it the average
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.480]  formula on the store shelves we've done this on air is 50% corn syrup high
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:28.760]  fructose filled with heavy metals on record that's just a loud government
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:38.520]  says so they care about us and on average another 25% or so as other sugars I
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:44.520]  mean folks that just that would they've done studies on rats feeding on that and
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:49.200]  they become just these lethargic mindless their brains don't grow mother's
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.040]  milk you know it comes out of your mother it's got every immunity passed on
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.840]  through women through the mitochondrial DNA and other systems back to our
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:06.600]  ancient ancestors every immunity is passed from the colostrum to the child
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:12.040]  all the mother's immunities nature's vaccine don't get that child instead
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.920]  we're going to feed you corn syrup and sugar and we're going to wonder why
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:26.080]  these people are like gibbering a jellyfish not made 18 months of pure
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:32.920]  mother's milk because I'm evil that's another reason I'm not a slave these
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:38.440]  people don't have a chance fluoride corn syrup GMO the environment of course the
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:44.080]  public oh my I mean we are under devastating attack and now they're
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.960]  launching the drones and weapons systems and of course saying it's for
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.080]  citizens and saying we're watching you we want you know we're watching you I'll
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:54.520]  get to that after calls I got a big report on it but I've already shag weight
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:57.360]  off into this and now they want to make you take statins you know they say in
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.440]  the US they want to put them on water they're like you know we want to put
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.000]  statins in the water and lithium that'll get the suicide down but we'll give you
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.480]  prozac is you're depressed which makes you commit suicide and wonder why
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:18.160]  suicide goes up to THX 1138 let's go ahead and talk to truth warrior in

[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:37.240]  breakdown robert in Missouri you're on the air welcome hey Alex hey I got some
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:43.240]  news for you have you ever heard I know you know this radio frequency energy
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:51.240]  yes okay I think I thought I've seen UFO 20 years ago well I finally figured it
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:57.480]  out these up on these cell phone towers and radio towers they have all these they
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:03.400]  look like drones but they fly and they usually only fly them at night I haven't
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:06.560]  ever seen them released from the towers but I've seen them actually flying in the
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.400]  air so I just wanted to blow that whole UFO thing out of water because it's they've
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.960]  been spying on us for over 20 years with this technology well if people seem to
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:19.920]  think a UFO means it's an alien it just means on an unidentified flying object
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.840]  people in the 50s and 60s would see the prototypes of the b2 bomber that's an
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.680]  ancient tinker toy that we're told is the most advanced along with the SR 71
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.160]  blackbird in service of 55 yeah that's explained we've got 55 and against not
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.000]  we it's the globalists that we are the slaves of that we finance our own
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.960]  slavery I had to break my conditioning we don't have the Air Force we don't have
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:46.680]  those weapons my own ego was thinking it was my military sorry let me just break
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.360]  that right now sorry I'm just shortly programming myself yes all the time out
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:55.240]  in New Mexico and Arizona they'll film these big drones these flying saucer
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.520]  drones with cameras they'll show blimp surveilling and they say it's a UFO where
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.200]  it even has propellers because even low-tech is very effective to have a
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:06.880]  big platform of surveillance equipment on it and the media will go along and say
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:13.000]  it's probably Casper the friendly Martian instead of going oh look that's a
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.120]  surveillance drone because there's not supposed to be secret government
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:23.440]  technology because Mercury is good for us and yes they do have a lot of drone
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.760]  type equipment hidden in plain view from some of my sources I've talked to
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.360]  they've got all sorts of landing decks on top buildings they're renting they've
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.320]  had a giant high altitude blimps up for at least 15 years and now they're just
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.040]  getting everybody ready I remember five years ago protesters in DC saw fake
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.920]  dragonflies and hummingbirds and they were conspiracy theorist we ran with it
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.960]  were evil cooks a year later they said yeah we got fake dragonflies we were
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.440]  watching you fake hummingbirds it's all your money sucker and we're gonna spend
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:28:00.680]  it so take some more shots we win sorry I'm just thinking of how wonderful our

[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.920]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:24.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:54.000]  caller actually here's the issue I got these bright lights in my face I got
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.320]  really good eyes but there's this little computer screen that's got their
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:02.320]  names and numbers up there this is a TV show slash radio I don't sit here and
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.760]  answer the calls myself I probably should and so I do get names wrong I
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:12.320]  call I call Michael Michelle and I call names wrong but the point is so what
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.080]  just move on man I mean I could do like coast-to-coast AM does sometimes where
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.560]  at least in the old days they would just say caller were you calling from and you
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.400]  could say your name and how you're listening but it becomes a pet peeve
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.160]  that when I screw up a name or the people putting your name in there screw
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.200]  it up because both happens or people mumble it that I'm sick of hearing
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:37.720]  about it do you understand that I've probably heard that a hundred times oh
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:42.560]  you screwed my name up who cares look you can call me Alice if you want in
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.680]  fact I think we're gonna start calling everybody what it do just come in here

[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:58.680]  now just be called Dave from Wisconsin how's that sound every caller now Mike

[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:15.800]  taking your phone calls I want to get into the drone pieces and play with
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.760]  Napolitano had to say about it and and really break down what this signifies
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.640]  and what this means and the magnitude of this because it's totally illegal and
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:31.400]  Napolitano points that out I mean it's illegal but so is all of this but I'm
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.720]  gonna go to your phone calls but I got to give each person like a minute cuz I
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:36.760]  want or you'll never get on air and I'll never get to the news and we got a
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:45.400]  guest coming up see Bell Edmonds let's go ahead and talk to wolf in Texas you're
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:52.520]  on the air wolf hey Alex you may know me I met you at the TSA rally down in
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:56.840]  Austin I'm the one who got you the information on the special forces out
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:01.360]  of Fort Hood deployment last year yes that was very good information thank you
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:16.320]  um I've got a very good friend that saw the original Zapruder film the uncut
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:22.160]  one the one that hasn't been seen since 1963 except for sitting president
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:32.640]  this individual's father who was in the OSI and had high security clearance this
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.160]  individual's brother and the brother's friend who's got the tape all died
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.000]  mysteriously in their early 50s from heart failure well that's no big deal
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:53.080]  everything's fine um he wants to come out and say what he saw what the true
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:58.960]  film looks like because we know the frames they cut out there were other
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:04.400]  photos taken of the flashes and the powder smoke from the grass you know the
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.160]  police all ran up there and we know we've had the head hit man who ran black
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:17.640]  op murders worldwide deathbed confession he Howard Hunt on this show so and we
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.680]  premiered the video by the way Coast to Coast had the audio did a great job
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.960]  there but sure have them send me some information you know the difference is
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:31.920]  though if you don't have the uncut quote Zapruder film which actually Groton
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.920]  actually did get and because he was working at time life and he actually
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:40.480]  got the time life photos like he's got some photos never before seen he was
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:43.560]  waiting till his book came out to do it by the way call him and see if that
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:47.240]  books out this big color book he was showing me photos with the whole back
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:50.920]  of Kennedy's head blown off and he's a famous guy I mean he I mean he is the
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.360]  guy who did work there and did leak it and all that and so I thought from what
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:59.960]  I know that they released to the media years later the cut one but then I'm
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:03.320]  going from memory here but Groton did leak the full film I mean what is he
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:13.760]  saying he saw in this other film he reportedly saw the umbrella man and a
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:25.400]  shooter in the gutter that was it's no longer there just before the man I don't
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.680]  think the government killed Kennedy they wouldn't do something like that I mean I
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.600]  think 91% of American people are mentally ill they haven't had enough mercury I mean
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:38.520]  the official story makes a lot of sense okay so I appreciate your call but I
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.720]  send us the information again I'm being sarcastic here today ladies and
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:49.240]  gentlemen Chris in Florida you're on the air welcome Alex yesterday in St. Petersburg
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:53.440]  and Romney showed up and we had we were changed to have a great opportunity to
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.120]  bullhorn him from Peter Way and that video will send you posted of course
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.440]  flash a great well-read sign over there website up there I wanted to point out
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:07.200]  also with a Glenn Beck so-called a debunking the footage from Linda
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:12.760]  Thompson's documentary called America under siege from the 90s and that video
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.400]  of the alleged concentration camp our camps that have been debunked and of
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:21.400]  course that one back claims to have done so work out laughter words I want to
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.800]  point out that what Linda Thompson had done was called for an armed march on
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.800]  Washington DC with all the militia and she was self-appointed a militia leader
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.200]  for the country and then she called that off she said she issued a letter of
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:41.940]  cancellation and saying that it was all a publicity stunt so I want that one
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:48.000]  back to know that you know he's not really such a pioneer in in debunking
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.200]  such an easily look that's the only string in the book for a month back
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.360]  today was going to expose the FEMA camps that are admitted on record for a
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:59.160]  quote emergencies and now they admit reeducation camps and he should come
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.520]  back and retract himself and he has the classic government minions from Hearst
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:07.600]  Publishing the fathers of yellow journalism on and says oh my gosh none
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.400]  of it's true and goes and debunks things that we debunked years ago and I had
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.880]  predicted on record that he would do it but I only said it the day before he
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.040]  aired it so that I wouldn't influence my prediction but I appreciate your call
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.560]  sir I can't wait to see that Mitt Romney footage Matt and Pennsylvania you're on
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:33.080]  the air Alex how are you doing oh I'm doing okay I guess I'm glad that in LA
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.100]  County they get the list of people that have bought raw milk and the SWAT team
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.680]  right I'm I think that's good that sounds like a free country right yeah
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:47.200]  that's definitely a free country there hey I wanted to ask your opinion about
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:52.600]  this summer I'm planning on taking my daughter to New York City but just
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.600]  everything going on I mean do you think it's safe
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.520]  New York City is a I like New York City in many respects I mean it's
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:15.320]  interesting but it is it is the capital of the Western New World Order and I I
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.640]  probably will never take my children there and you know I have to debate
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:22.840]  whether I need to get them out of this country the problem is there's no where
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.600]  to run I mean this this country really is been taken over by vicious criminals
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:33.600]  that want to kill their opposition I mean we're run by some bad people so I
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.640]  would just think about that I mean I mean if you've got the money and have
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.280]  already gotten prepared and stuff and you think you want to give her the
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.960]  cultural experience of going to the New York Natural History Museum and the
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.320]  planetarium and stuff it's interesting I'd love to take my children there but
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.980]  I don't have time to drive them there and I just can't let weird perverts you
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:54.600]  know grab them and drag them in the back room and rip their clothes off and
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.000]  everything and have cops swatting me and beat me over the head so you know
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.680]  country's dying right in front of me it's real sad if we have to do that we're
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.240]  not going to see whatever attractions you know because I'm not gonna let
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.160]  somebody lay their hands on my dog they're now doing that at a lot of it a
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:15.200]  Disney World and stuff they're starting selective groping and have scanning and
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:20.280]  the Pentagon admits it's a laboratory of prison cities Disney facilities now our
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.280]  Pentagon run models on you can actually look this up Disney admits this isn't
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:30.000]  this is in their public reports first one I saw was in 96 just type in Disney
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.840]  Pentagon laboratory and you think it's fun with everybody there but but it's
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:41.480]  actually a model of a concentration camp how you go in how you're surveilled how
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:47.280]  you purchase it's a model of the casual society beast system how's that sound
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.480]  sounds like a all-american great family vacation I tell you real quick about my
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:43:02.960]  experience in 2006 traveling sure okay my family and I were going flying from

[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.800]  could not believe it you know because my daughter was four at the time she was
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:46.480]  scared she didn't know what was going on that's all they're training your daughter
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:50.440]  grandma see daddy taken away that's why they have FEMA training to take the

[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.560]  ago about the plan for the smart meter and it wasn't you know openly admitted
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:42.120]  them but it was in government documents we were conspiracy theorists now it's
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:49.960]  admitted but a spy drone again today almost flew into a passenger jet over
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.560]  Denver international and FAA is investigating extremely dangerous
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.880]  incident it was the drone that almost caused the accident but doesn't matter
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:02.680]  the answer is just get rid of pilots again they'll still be there like a
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:08.000]  ceremonial toilet attendant or a waiter but the aircraft can be flown by the
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.520]  robots means the globalist can make your plane crash that they want has a lot of
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.880]  other good little options for you hope you'll all enjoy that as well hundreds of

[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:27.160]  continuing this was on again a big story got a lot of attraction as it should
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.880]  yesterday was up on drudge till this morning it's at info wars dot com by
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.400]  Steve Watson judge to Palatano first Patriot to shoot down a government spy
[01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:39.560]  drone will be a hero blast illegal use of plastic drones the spinal Americans in
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.240]  their backyards and shepherd Smith who other than the Palatano is one of the
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.880]  better people on Fox cuz they know the libertarian systems very popular so they
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:54.720]  let those guys talk about a little bit of freedom but on a short leash and he
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:00.200]  points out as a local news reporter if somebody had a fence you really it's
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.160]  about an eight-foot fence is what the regs and laws say but he said it was a
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.880]  12-foot fence and some guys got his you know movie star girlfriend out there
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:10.720]  sunbathing naked I can't jack a camera up on a tripod and look at her I go to
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.280]  jail that's illegal and the Palatano is yes it's illegal for the government as
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.920]  well and then they just go into it all but in the earlier parts of the two
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:25.160]  newscasts that we have posted in the article on info wars that the news is
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.440]  saying it's good on Fox they're gonna keep us safe from Tim McVeigh is that
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:33.880]  potting soil really explosives you're being watched and then they cut to these
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:39.200]  guys with the rest of the story but here is the Palatano saying he agrees
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:42.600]  with a columnist that said the first person to shoot down a drone is going
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:47.760]  to be a hero now the first person to shoot down one of these illegal drones
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:52.440]  is gonna get swat teamed and diesel till their feet explode and tortured and
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:55.840]  probably gang raped because the government's run by sadomasochistic
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:00.240]  murdering scum who hate this country let's go ahead and play the clip I
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.920]  listened to Charles Krauthammer last night and Democrats to there seems to
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:08.520]  be bipartisan outrage from this about this do you think this is one time
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:11.720]  where both sides will come together well I would hope so I mean when the
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:14.800]  president bomb Libya the Congress look the other way now the president wants
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:19.600]  the dispatch plastic drones to spy on Americans it would be reprehensible for
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.600]  the Congress to look the other way and I want to give a shout out to Charles
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:28.120]  Krauthammer he's 100% correct the first American patriot that shoots down one
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.920]  of these drones that comes too close to his children his backyard will be an
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.040]  American hero I'm just gonna give you another scenario
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.440]  Laquahana 6 training in Buffalo they think there's something going on there
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.280]  they can't get in but they can see above would you say it's okay to use a drone
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:44.840]  for that get a search warrant from a judge that's what the Constitution says
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:48.920]  all right we'll find out coming to a neighborhood near you coming to a
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:52.480]  neighborhood near you but but again it's keep us safe from a terrorist the
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:56.480]  terrorists that the government openly funds in plain view in front of
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:01.120]  everyone people say Alex you don't know of 9-11's an inside job it was in
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.720]  Newsweek the hijackers were trained at US bases and the colonel went public and
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.080]  said I was for I trained Muhammad Eda the government's involved in this of
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:17.160]  course criminal elements they ran drills of attacking the exact same buildings
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.080]  at the exact same time on 9-11 same thing on 7-7 in London and it came out
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.920]  there that an MI6 agent was running that operation and the guys were patsies that
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.040]  thought they were part of a drill folks don't ever get recruited as an informant
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.440]  and they want you to simulate explosives in fact people know that now that's why
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:39.440]  they've actually got to find mentally retarded people now to set up before they
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:42.640]  would get like a school teacher hey you're a Muslim you know you've spoken
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.760]  out against Muslim extremism how'd you like to get paid on top of it do some

[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.320]  sarcastically saying the stuff that's in the news but it still sounds like satire
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:22.840]  because it's so over-the-top and I may sound mean to the system calling them
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:27.560]  scum trash if people would have done this with the Soviets or with the Nazis
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:30.600]  or with others stuff wouldn't have gone the way it did I mean we got to call this
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:35.680]  out you know how many Rockefeller Foundation documents we posted info
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:37.560]  wars.com over the years where they admit
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:43.640]  sterilants in the food and water brain damaging us how they're doing it all the
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:47.760]  other UN documents I mean it's all right there I mean they're killing us man
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:52.440]  this is serious and then even when Fox criticizes the drones because CNN and
[01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:56.080]  others are like Anderson Cooper who admits he CIA is like breathless it'll
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:00.680]  keep us safe 30,000 drones thank God the Pentagon's here it's so good at troops

[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:12.360]  sitting there looking at all of this and even on these Fox news shows if you go
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:15.720]  to info wars.com to our article about it Judge Napolitano first Patriot shoot

[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.880]  funny it's like I walked out of PFC a couple years ago and I said you know
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.160]  that's the dying core building they got caught running giant child kidnapping
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:57.920]  rings the cops started laughing goes I know I do work for him sometimes like
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.200]  the head you know the head commander or whatever they all just laughed at me it
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:04.720]  was just funny because see if they didn't laugh they'd have to go oh you're
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:08.520]  you're good guys that fight crime there it is right there oh I do off duty work
[01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:13.320]  for them and of course most people in the building aren't involved in that it's
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:20.120]  just it's just like the police don't even investigate money laundering by big
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:24.480]  banks but when you go in to wire a thousand dollars you get 20 questions
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.040]  because you're a lowdown scum American or you know if you if you're you know
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:34.040]  getting a check for say $5,000 to pay somebody oh what's this for let me oh
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:36.960]  you're gonna do a little secret police questions yes we are do you have
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:41.400]  something to hide oh really how much drug money is this this bank launder shut
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:46.200]  up and stop treating me like a criminal you filth you little stosie spy you're
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.840]  the threat you're the scum you're the dirtbag you're you want to make me feel
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.760]  guilty I'm sorry I'm gonna try not to get angry anymore let's just go back and
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.520]  go to the next Apollo tono clip when he was on with shepherd Smith here it is
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:02.360]  thanks well well Fox News senior judicial analyst judge Andrew Napolitano was
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:05.720]  with they can't require us to build an extra bedroom but I guess they can spy
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:09.160]  on us from ahead well they can't spy on us from ahead they really can't tell
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:12.760]  they can't but they will did you see any legislation enacted by the Congress or
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:16.720]  signed by the president or any amendment to the Constitution answer no these are
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:22.080]  regulations in which bureaucrats gave themselves the authority to capture
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.680]  images of us in the privacy of our backyards and depending upon how low
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.880]  the drones fly Jonathan can back me up inside the home the drone is able to see
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:34.440]  inside the home and to retain and analyze and distribute amongst members of
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.240]  the government what they find this is not permitted by the Constitution it's
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:41.560]  not permitted by federal law the Congress didn't vote on it the president's
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:45.240]  been silent about it bureaucrats did it on their own and this has been the case
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:50.640]  forever and I know from working local television 1520 longer than that ago if
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:55.320]  you as a citizen have a reasonable expectation of privacy for instance your
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:58:00.200]  girlfriend is laying out by the pool in the backyard and you have a 12 foot fence
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:04.400]  around your backyard if my television camera shoots over that 12 foot fence
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:08.080]  at that woman who's naked in the backyard I've committed a crime because she has a
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.760]  reasonable expectation of privacy the drone shouldn't be allowed to do that
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:15.200]  either for the exact same reason I would make the same argument as your
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:18.080]  hypothetical neighbor who wants to see which a girlfriend looks like the
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:22.520]  government would commit the crime chef this is very serious it's one thing for
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:25.280]  the government to do it it's another thing for the Defense Department to do
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:29.800]  it the Defense Department cannot engage in any activity in the United States of
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:34.320]  America we'll be back from the president hey everything they do is illegal they
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:38.640]  don't care because they're hijackers the people running the country work for
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:51.040]  foreign banks you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today for a long
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.280]  time you've heard me talk about building your own food supply with e-foods

[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:46.200]  of UN Trump's Congress and getting approval for war on Syria Defense
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:50.440]  Secretary reaffirms Obama administration's unconstitutional stance
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:54.400]  following controversy over his assertion and seeking international permission
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.560]  from the UN to launch wars trumps the authority of Congress Secretary of
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:03.520]  Traders activity Leon Panetta the hijacker for Goldman Sachs over the
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:09.800]  U.S. reaffirmed this premise during a recent testimony before the vestigial
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.160]  ceremonial Congress in which he again stated that Congress would play a
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:19.280]  second fiddle to the international community i.e. foreign eugenics criminal
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:24.680]  bankers asked adding parts to Paul Watson's article here as we go as by
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:28.720]  congressman Walter Jones who has launched a resolution the affirming the
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:33.800]  limits of presidential power by by making the launching of war without
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:38.240]  congressional approval and impeachable offense by the president Obama would seek
[02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:42.520]  re-election or authorization from Congress before attacking Iran or Syria
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.880]  Panetta stopped short of answering in the affirmative but he did kind of go
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:50.600]  backwards a little bit which is a good sign we can put more pressure on him he
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:57.400]  goes we will clearly work with Congress while we still chill your number back
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.680]  door you'll not you'll never stop us excuse me we will clearly work with
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:06.640]  the Congress if it comes to the issue of the use of force said Panetta backing
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.800]  away from comments made March which we have a link to when he told the Senate
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:14.360]  Armed Services Committee quote our goal would be to seek international
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:18.440]  permission and we would come to Congress and inform you and determine how best to
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:23.160]  approach this whether or not we would want we would want to get permission from
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:27.520]  the Congress I want to see if I can get permission you know I might want to get
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:30.920]  permission before I grab a lady in a park you know Panetta says and beat her
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:35.360]  over the head or maybe I'll just do it if I feel like it continuing here
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:39.960]  however Panetta later told Congressman Randy Forbes during the House Armed
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:43.840]  Services meeting the commander-in-chief has the authority to take action the
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:48.440]  commander-in-chief what a joke that involves the vital interest of this
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.320]  country that means the vital interest of the bankers and destroying America
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.920]  adding that the president would have to quote take steps to get congressional
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:59.800]  approval under the War Powers Act so that's actually a big reversal would the
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:03.280]  approval be required before you could take a military action against Syria
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.440]  asked Forbes the president could act it could in fact deploy forces if he had to
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:12.000]  if our vital interests were at stake Panetta said so you get the support of
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.720]  Congress after you begin military operations asked Forbes in that
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.720]  particular situation yes Panetta reaffirming the congressional authorization
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:23.280]  would not be needed but he's gone from just laughing and going shut up to him
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:26.960]  I mean but don't worry all those congressmen are going on no fly list you
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:32.160]  know there are a lot of members of Congress on no fly list you think I'm
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:35.800]  joking guys just typing members of Congress on no fly list and they go to
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:42.160]  the bureaucracy and say hey get me off that and they say shut up you saw the
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:45.120]  congressman down in San Antonio where they pull him out they have the cops
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.840]  waiting and they say look you're gonna get crushed they're not flying the cop
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:55.000]  sits there and he just has to lean back and the TSA goes to work and they go

[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:31.960]  Alex Jones
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:35.360]  a lot of people were coming home from the New Year's holiday when suddenly a man
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:40.520]  starts acting strangely he starts saying I'm God I'm in charge LAX police and
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:47.600]  arrest that man and he turns out to be a TSA agent they are the first line of
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:51.200]  defense and airport security transportation security administration
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:55.040]  agents but there have been a troubling incident by the way that's not the only
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:58.720]  time they flip out and begin trying to rape women asking them out on dates
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:06.240]  robbing things groping children I mean just a group of crazy people I mean who
[02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:10.280]  wants a job taking people's diapers off and groping their wives and children in
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:15.400]  front of them this is total federalization total tyranny no country does
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.640]  this not even North Korea and now they're on the streets and all of it
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:25.680]  based on the fraud the giant stinking pile of lies that is the false flag
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:31.160]  staged event of 9-11 months before 9-11 I said that criminal elements of the
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:33.520]  government we're going to blow up the world trade centers and blame it on
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:39.920]  their CIA asset bin Laden I shut it the day of the event and I went from over a
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.120]  hundred radio stations to less than 30 in one month and I was told stop saying it
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:49.440]  by the stations we're gonna turn you off and I said I can't I saw him blow up
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.920]  building seven that day remember that I saw ran corporation documents about
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:58.240]  plans for this I saw the media gearing up for people to give up their rights
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:01.800]  when the terrorists hit and you know Newsweek reports the hijackers were
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.840]  trained at US bases there were drills for a stand down that was tripod to they
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:12.240]  found the passports within hours and and that's impossible for them to survive
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:16.480]  and be found and I went on and on and on it's the truth I've got to tell the
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:21.720]  truth my point is I didn't come out and say I mean I was already exploding in
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:26.360]  talk radio 12 years ago you know but leading up to 9-11 11 years ago or 10
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:32.160]  and a half years ago I had made it I was successful I'd been on air you know
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:36.160]  five years and was already very successful and saw that all reversed
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:43.920]  because I would tell the truth I'm saying I paid a big price financially my
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:47.440]  career everything but my career isn't a career about money or fame it's about
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.880]  exposing this and I'm not saying I'm a hero I'm pointing out a lot of people
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:55.520]  have given their lives to tell the truth like Barry Jennings that died shortly
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:58.360]  after we aired interview with him the deputy head of emergency management
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:02.400]  admitting bombs and building seven so many others I've interviewed police
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:05.320]  officers who've been death-threaded after they come on who were there and heard
[02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:09.240]  the countdown to blow up seven we have the footage of cops saying get back
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:13.880]  they're gonna blow up seven that's seeing in we have BBC saying you know it
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:19.200]  had fallen before it did we have them and there's the problem 9-11 is there's
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.840]  thousands of pieces but bottom line it was used to take our rights now we're
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:28.240]  about to go to C. Bell Edmonds but the point is people
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:34.160]  contact us good old boys I run into military generals I meet with retired
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:37.080]  generals and they go Alex look I know that the government is a lot of bad
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.800]  stuff stage Gulf of Tonkin and things but it's just hard to believe the
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:43.440]  government would do that and I go it's not the government it's the criminal
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.200]  banking elements that launder the money run the child kidnapping rings that are
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:52.480]  on record in Congress that C. Bell Edmonds exposed and others have they
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:55.760]  are the ones that have hijacked the country and there are radical Muslims
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:59.360]  their groups they fund it's in the news that they're funding al-Qaeda to attack
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:03.760]  Syria they gave Libya to al-Qaeda they're training the coastal liberation army
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:10.320]  with al-Qaeda in the mainstream news is reporting on it to go into Syria the US
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:13.680]  ambassador the UN said last week there'll be more bombings Assad if you
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:17.600]  don't step down they're calling them activists who are blowing up police
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:28.240]  stations in Syria this is the reality and I've interviewed Colonel Schaefer who
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:33.000]  said yes you know a SWAT and a lot of these other guys they're double agents
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.640]  inside the Pentagon and FBI yes this stuff staged and he was hunting Midlotton
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:42.120]  could have killed him wasn't allowed to but the biggest whistleblower out there
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:47.440]  bar none is C. Bell Edmonds she's the editor of Boiling Frogs post and co-founder
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:51.120]  director of national security whistleblowers coalition she's a recipient
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:56.560]  of the 2006 pin Newman's own First Amendment Award Miss Edmonds worked as
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:02.520]  a luggage specialist for the language specialist for the FBI I was thinking
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:08.160]  about the TSA where she I reported serious acts of security breaches and
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:13.240]  cover-ups she was looking at NSA interception listening to it and for
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:17.480]  that she was retaliated against it unfairly fired now I wanted to recap her
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:22.200]  story she told Congress in closed session closed hearings then she was told
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:26.240]  shut up there's other whistleblowers but they didn't have the courage that she's
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:33.280]  had to go public she later broke the gag order and went through what she heard
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:37.960]  the government drug dealing Al Qaeda being commanded arms dealing now they
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:42.640]  admit they grow the opium in Afghanistan so I wanted to just preface all of this
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:47.440]  upfront that she's undoubtedly the biggest and most senior whistleblower to
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:51.440]  actually put the finger from the inside not just the image we're seeing from the
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:55.600]  outside clearly using the attacks to take our liberties launch wars lie about
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:14:02.680]  WMD's create a clash of civilizations as peanut called for and her website is
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:08.240]  classified woman calm she has a new book out in the startling new memoir
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.480]  Sebel Edmonds the most classified woman in US history takes on a real journey
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:19.560]  that begins with a secretive FBI down the dark halls of feckless Congress to a
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.000]  stonewall and judiciary and finally to the National Security whistleblowers
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.520]  movement she spearheaded will stop right there and bring her up with us for the
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:30.280]  balance of the hour but it's great to have her here with us correct any points
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:35.000]  that I may have gotten wrong recap your story what you heard and what your book
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  covers thank you very much Alex and thank you for this great intro one of the
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.200]  thing is then you just mentioned that I'm the most classified woman in the
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:51.160]  history of United States this is what the United States legal communities
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:56.000]  including the ACLU have comment that you know they slapped me with the state
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:02.320]  secrets privilege not one twice and with this book classified woman we have been
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:06.840]  fighting the FBI and the Justice Department for over a year to get this
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:12.040]  book out to publish it and you have to submit it to the FBI because they only
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:16.600]  when you when you work for agencies like this and you obtain clearance they make
[02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:21.960]  you find these forms and papers and you give up every single right you have as
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:26.360]  a citizen most importantly you give up your first amendment right I didn't
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:30.760]  realize it when I took the job with the FBI three days after 9-11 I was naive I
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:36.280]  was one of the majority of the United States who believe FBI was a you know
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:42.640]  good law enforcement agency I had a master's degree in public policy and my
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:47.240]  head was filled up with all these theoretical and you know fantastical
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:52.520]  lies that we still have separation of powers and system of checks and balances
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:57.200]  so I went ahead and I find those papers well they use those papers saying you
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:02.360]  have no right to publish a single warden this book ordinarily they take it you
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:05.680]  know all these people who have had clearance with FBI they have to submit
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:10.440]  it okay I mean this is this itself is police state because this is this is
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:16.000]  absolutely contradiction to our first amendment and the FBI has to go through
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.440]  it and decide what they need to read that and they have 30 business days to do
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:23.000]  that they sat on it for one year they send letters to my attorney they said
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.720]  they are not releasing a single word not a single word yeah let's be clear let's
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:31.640]  tell people what you were doing you were for the FBI looking at NSA intercepts so
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:35.080]  you three days after 9-11 you get hired they're hiring a big force to go in
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:39.720]  there and listen to the Arabic and things you're hearing Al Qaeda I mean tell
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:44.800]  people in a nutshell the intercepts what you heard well first of all there were
[02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:49.120]  several areas where I was working for the FBI counterintelligence and also
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:57.120]  counterterrorism now some of these files dated back to mid 1990s Alex 1996 okay
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:04.840]  and it covered the period 96 to 2001 and we as a nation and this is not the FBI
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:08.340]  okay this is the CIA and the State Department our military industrial
[02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:13.400]  complex we were busy working in Central Asia and in caucuses these are the
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:19.440]  Turkic Republics you know the ex-Soviet Union state and I do speak those
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:24.680]  languages I speak Turkish I speak other way Johnny so I had to re-review because
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:29.200]  they had been translated summary translation before and basically it
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:35.520]  showed that our government okay has been working with you didn't even call them
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:40.520]  al-Qaeda al-Qaeda didn't get to be called al-Qaeda until 9-11 in the FBI they
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:45.800]  still refers to them our government as Mujahideen our allies Mujahideen so they
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:50.800]  were creating cells in Central Asia and caucuses and they had an arm of NATO and
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.680]  this is through their you know Turkey that ally countries a NATO member and
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:18:00.120]  creating cells together with these elements from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:06.480]  Bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri and they were pouring hundreds of millions of
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:11.520]  dollars creating these terror cells against Russia in Central Asia and
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:17.200]  caucuses in other by Johnny in Pakistan in Tajikistan and they're using the same
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.760]  terror cells against Libya and Syria and against Russia again while using them
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:26.240]  against us to take our liberties they've been using and they've been partners with
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:30.080]  these people those people actually work for us they have been working for us since
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:35.200]  1980s at the big Afghan and this is after the Russian thing now you're seeing stuff
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:41.720]  96 you said up and you said up to the day of 9-11 tell us about those 300 much
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:47.640]  losses okay with our money our taxpayers money Congress would help the federal
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:51.840]  government and this is the State Department and Pentagon to funnel money to
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:57.200]  these Turkish construction companies these are front companies as these are
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:04.360]  the aid the US aid to democracy to these to these states when the money was
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:10.880]  being used building madrasas bringing Zawahiri several times into other by
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:15.360]  judge so for the FBI it was a shock because the FBI they were not like the
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:19.520]  CIA I mean not the heads the heads of FBI they're part of the same police state
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:24.480]  but these agents for years have been calling for real investigation but they
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:29.520]  were being shut down by the State Department and the CIA this was our
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:34.520]  so-called diplomatic foreign relations this was what we were doing we were also
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:39.320]  doing it in certain regions of China you know it's referred to as east by the way
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:43.200]  stay there you know whistleblowers are protected under the Constitution when
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:47.240]  they're exposing criminal activity folks you're hearing I mean she's she's
[02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:52.840]  breaking stuff down here that that it again absolutely proves it I mean she
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:58.200]  saw the intercepts with bin Laden right up to 9-11 under CIA command well they're
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:03.600]  right back ladies and gentlemen a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:07.480]  research into why even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:11.960]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:14.840]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:19.120]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.880]  working for the FBI and and and from what she's saying there's some good
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:27.720]  people in the FBI we know the head of counterterrorism O'Neill quit and even
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:30.640]  told British papers they're working with Al Qaeda they're gonna stage something
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:35.120]  and use it to launch wars yeah and a lot more and then of course he died on 9
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:38.960]  11 in the World Trade Center if you can believe that but going back to C. Bell
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:42.080]  Edmonds in her new book we're gonna be talking about this is a short segment
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:45.440]  long segment coming up we're gonna do a commercial free long interview whether
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:50.280]  on Friday on info wars nightly news as well and hopefully have her one video
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:55.720]  Skype he's on phone today so see Bell continuing let's get to the nitty gritty
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.360]  and how you did get the book published but first you know I mean repeat because
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:03.160]  you didn't break the gag order till a few years ago and then now you're going
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:06.120]  even further and they've been persecuting people that expose them
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:11.000]  obviously we know there's a whole NSA division that's leaked just a spy on
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.760]  government people that know the truth of 9 11 but tell folks of the relationship
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:20.440]  with Al Qaeda drug dealing weapons and the CIA State Department break it down
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:26.600]  for folks let's give you one very straightforward example in mid 90s okay
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:33.320]  the US and NATO they use the largest private Turkish Airlines okay that went
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:39.280]  into caucuses and Central Asia and this is this place Central Asian caucuses
[02:25:39.280 --> 02:25:44.840]  had much ahead in from all over the place you know Saudi Arabia Pakistan part
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:49.920]  of the group was actually Chechen and they brought these much ahead in into
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:55.320]  Turkey they gave them Turkish passport they trained up militaristically for
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:25:59.000]  three to six months with Turkish passport then these individuals the same
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.720]  much ahead in these are the people under Zabahiria under bin Laden they were
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:08.360]  with NATO planes again Turkey is a NATO country where them transferred into
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:13.240]  Bosnia you know back into Albania coastal region we were working the same
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:17.200]  thing we were taking them actually into Romania and they all held Turkish
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:22.160]  passport okay well these people were the people as I said we have been
[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:27.600]  partnered with and then 9 11 happened and they come out and they say there is you
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:33.280]  know this Al Qaeda this brand that sounds pretty ferocious Al Qaeda and then
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:37.600]  there is this bin Laden and these people have been you know they hate us and the
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:42.880]  way we live well I always tell people Alex terrorists no matter from where they
[02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:48.560]  cannot take away our freedom they can't make it then it's our constitution not
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:55.360]  a death the only power capable of taking away our liberty and destroying our
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:00.040]  constitution is the government our own government you can have a terrorist
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:04.000]  either domestically or internationally blow up a bus but can they blow up a
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.440]  constitution well that's what our government has been doing since 2001 9
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:14.360]  11 they have been basically they have made constitution irrelevant because
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:19.360]  constitution today is some kind of a historic document because we're just one
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:23.920]  more country gone we're just one more country that they're looting just like
[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:29.080]  Afghanistan for the opium and of course there's all these factions of
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:32.960]  different groups that want the opium of course Al Qaeda Mujahideen was the
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:37.000]  faction that worked with the west this was all a big joke for them to help
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.760]  knock out the other Taliban and people who had been shutting down opium
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.240]  production absolutely and you have you ever heard anyone in the mainstream
[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:50.800]  media or even the quasi-alternative media talking about this the heroin and
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:56.200]  opium production is a no-no it's a no-no they won't touch that topic look at
[02:27:56.200 --> 02:28:01.960]  Afghan GDP if you don't even have a GDP right well the whole economy is based
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.120]  on this and you're looking at hundreds of billions of dollars where is it
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:10.040]  going they point out once in a while time magazine and those crap shooters
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:14.760]  they say look at those guys with shawar those bearded guys they are the warlords
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:19.360]  who have all the opium those guys don't have hundreds of billions of dollars
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:23.200]  who are the ones who are getting this hundreds of billions of dollars who are
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:28.240]  the real players I mean you look at NATO and say that's one arm of NATO nobody
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:35.560]  dares to expose and it's been the case for so long but you find one person one
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:40.640]  reporter from the mainstream or the quasi-the source on the quasi-alternative
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:45.920]  and show one that who dares touching this no it's all a total hoax we're
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:49.480]  about to go to break long-signment coming up but get back into more of these
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:55.000]  communiques what did you think as you're in there as an FBI translator reading
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.360]  this you were somebody you know with all these degrees and things that believe
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:03.280]  the official narrative of how the world works what was going through your mind
[02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:08.520]  I was so naive I thought if I were to go and tell the people in Congress in the
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:13.160]  Senate Intelligence Committee if I were to go to court I was going to expose this
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.000]  and we were going to have a bunch of high-level US officials go to jail I was
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:22.760]  that naive I mean I was almost a stupid and so I did go through these so-called
[02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:27.800]  channels and with every channel they shut me up further they even
[02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:32.200]  invoked gag orders illegally unconstitutionally on Congress by a
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:37.560]  retroactive classification and it took me five years to realize there is no
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:42.160]  system the system has been broken there is only one branch of government and
[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:47.520]  that is the police the state government one there is no separation of powers they
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:50.640]  have the better stay there stay there we're gonna be right back we're on the

[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:44.400]  they're hiding under every table okay but the government even if you believe
[02:33:44.400 --> 02:33:49.440]  that is bringing in record numbers to the west okay I don't think they're bad
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:55.440]  people I'm not buying that propaganda my point is that if you know about
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:00.360]  British intelligence radicalizing the Wahhabist and using them to create Saudi
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:05.680]  Arabia if you know about every time these Arabic speaking nations that are
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:09.760]  always been highly advanced in their city-state areas you know inventing
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:15.680]  mathematics you name it tries to build up a civilization on par with the west
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:19.880]  they just send in the jihadis they've been doing it for a hundred years and
[02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:23.840]  we're seeing it right now again in the Balkans we're seeing it right now
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:28.120]  people say well you're for the Serbs no I'm not for the Serbs I'm for the
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:32.760]  Muslims I'm for whoever the globalists are attacking and they'll play Christians
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:37.760]  off against Muslims then they'll play Muslims you know off against the the
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:45.840]  Russians they'll play this just goes on and on and think about what a master
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:52.560]  skeleton key al-qaeda is they create it because the real Taliban had cut opium
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:57.200]  production down to nothing they blow up the world trade centers blame it on
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:00.680]  al-qaeda create this narrative set up some hijackers that were really taking
[02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:06.280]  part in drills we know that they just set them up add up the to topless bars
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:10.560]  drinking liquor you know all of it massade FBI following them all part of
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:13.800]  the drill they set up guys now it's going to be harder because people understand
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:20.680]  this just like 7-7 it's the same story over and over again and again it's
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:25.000]  criminal elements globalists that want to bring in the national security state
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:29.600]  shut down free speech bankrupt the country have a military industrial
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.200]  complex gobble up the US as they've done the rest of the world and then
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.240]  meanwhile the average soldier going off the dye thinks they're fighting al-qaeda
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:41.120]  as the globalist race to replace them with robots and drones soon you want to
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:44.520]  be in the equation but your death benefits are stolen you're treated like
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:48.360]  crud record suicides you know we had corrupt good old boys 50 years ago but
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:52.240]  they didn't have troops served seven eight turds and then they say you're the
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:55.400]  new enemy now they're flipping from al-qaeda to domestic groups they're
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:36:01.040]  getting ready to stage terror attacks and blame it on constitutionalist we you
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:05.280]  think they hate independent Arab countries or Muslim nations they really
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:08.960]  hated independent America they hate anybody that doesn't want to get rid of
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:12.560]  the family and take the eugenics and be part of this we're gonna go back to C. Bell
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.280]  Edmonds here in just a moment the point is is that when you see something of this
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:22.400]  magnitude and she's on record she testified to Congress it's on record I've
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:26.400]  confirmed from countless sources what she's saying it's all come out now the
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:29.320]  trip started going I don't want to grow the opium so they just hide it in plain
[02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:32.600]  view on the news yeah we grow it it's patriotic and the troops think well it
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.800]  must not be bad it's on Fox and CNN that we grow the opium and loaded on C-130s
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:40.920]  when they took over Afghanistan they put conscripts in the front lines to be
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.000]  killed as theater the Taliban al-qaeda were just waiting to be put on C-130s
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.280]  and flown to Pakistan and paid in gold bars BBC reported to start the next
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:56.560]  phase al-qaeda is made up and now you have the TSA taking over now you have
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:00.840]  total federalization the drones and they're saying oh yeah the new threat is
[02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:07.960]  patriots I told you that was coming they always get rid of the rights on an
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:16.220]  unpopular minority they're following an exact program now going back to
[02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:20.480]  Sebel Edmonds I want to try to give you the floor now because I can hear I've
[02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:23.080]  heard you a lot of times radio you're very very focused and calm I could tell
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:26.800]  you're emotional today because I must have gotten you fired up tell us again
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:29.920]  more about what your book covers if they were sitting on it for a year
[02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:33.880]  threatening people how did you finally get it published help folks so they can
[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:37.920]  get it but then go through for people that don't know the type of communicates
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:41.160]  you read what you saw because when you finally broke your gag order they
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:43.280]  didn't persecute you like they've done others because they don't want to bring
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:47.120]  attention to this you've got a lot of courage because they've killed others
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:49.560]  that have tried to do what you're doing I want you to speak about that if you've
[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:55.560]  had threats or things like that but I want you see Bell Edmonds to your biggest
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:59.280]  whistleblower in 9-11 maybe in US history I mean she makes the Pentagon
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:04.080]  papers look like a joke and when we've had the Pentagon papers guy on he said
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:07.360]  9-11 was an inside job and then said change that I'm getting heat you know
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:12.680]  reverse that I want to go back but that's a side issue Sebel again tell us
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:15.880]  the rest of the meat because you said two years ago when you broke your gag
[02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:19.560]  order that you were able to see the communicates with Al Qaeda being commanded
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:25.480]  by the CIA right up to 9-11 tell us what you saw well Alex it's very hard to
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:29.600]  get down because one of the things that media does they never provide people with
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.520]  contacts and that's why I wanted to write this book and I wanted to put it out
[02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:38.720]  give people the contacts the details give them the whole thing that's when
[02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:42.920]  they start getting the picture because when it comes in little by lines or
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:48.160]  little little small headlines here and there it's in pieces and this is why
[02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:53.160]  for over a year government has been right now under this threat these are
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:56.680]  official letters it's on my website in my attorneys you know they are my
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:01.040]  attorneys website they said I'm gonna face prosecution if I publish this book
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:06.600]  okay I said I am going to do it under my first amendment and I'm going to stand
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:11.520]  up for my first amendment and the big publishers the mega corporate publishers
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:15.520]  they didn't want to touch it they said they didn't want to get on the wrong
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:20.880]  side of the FBI I said fine I will publish it myself I went and I got and
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:26.120]  I hired my own editors my own you know people to help me with the cover of the
[02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:30.680]  book everything in this book I did it you know why because those publishers
[02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:36.840]  unless it is kosher by the government and considered kosher a lot of CIA with
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:40.840]  those war books are coming out there are not whistleblower books they are
[02:39:40.840 --> 02:39:46.280]  actually they're white washes to act like it's a whistleblower to sell false
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:49.920]  narratives because people people only believe the cognitive dissonance when
[02:39:49.920 --> 02:39:53.800]  it poses as a whistleblower and cast Sunstein the White House admits that's
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:40:00.040]  part of a strategic program absolutely anyone who says otherwise I will line up
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:04.960]  people my organization has 150 national security whistleblowers especially with
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:09.400]  the CIA the CIA doesn't want your books to get out it won't come out
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:13.240]  guaranteed or you're gonna be jailed okay and then they're gonna do what they did
[02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:18.120]  with Colonel Schaefer they're gonna they're gonna ask for 5-1 they're gonna take
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:21.880]  these books they're gonna burn them that's what we are doing that's what our
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:26.240]  government has been doing so I challenge and challenging that standing up for my
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:29.400]  heart I want to stop you right there because this is so amazing we're gonna
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:32.600]  have an in-depth hour-plus interview tomorrow on the nightly news commercial
[02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:36.240]  free but I always start a story and never finish it I started the interview by
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:42.240]  saying I lost 70 plus percent of my stations I went through hell for
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:46.800]  exposing 9-11 is an inside job death threats you name it but nothing compared
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:51.800]  to you they're threatening you with prison publicly after 10 years of you
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:56.480]  trying to expose this evil if you publish this book and you've done it and I
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:41:02.240]  just cannot say with enough words how much courage that you've got but I mean
[02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:07.120]  I wish more men were like you Alex because you know because there are so few
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:11.160]  of us who are becoming whistleblowers and doing this they are getting away with
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:15.400]  so much of this because they intimidate people I tell people imagine with the
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:20.720]  torture cases if we had 30 CIA officers most of them are 30 people anyway but
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:25.480]  let's say they walked out and they said be quit this is despicable and they went
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.280]  to the media they wouldn't even call them whistleblowers the problem is we have
[02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:33.360]  become exception to the rule okay so therefore they can't finger point and
[02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:37.200]  say they must be enough cases they are eccentric they are just grunt old
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:41.600]  employees that the media they make sure they don't cover the case so they get
[02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:46.080]  away but they need the numbers there was the other people that and they not that
[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:50.640]  must be I know from the FBI so many people good agents wanted to do the
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:53.400]  same thing but they were afraid they were afraid they were gonna lose their
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:58.160]  pension they were afraid because they had they try to destroy shaper retirement
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.240]  they try to destroy shaper and he hasn't gone half as far as you have but last
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:05.200]  time he was on he just went ahead and bartered it out he goes yeah this guy and
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:07.680]  that guy and most of them actually are working for the government that these
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.960]  all kind of people and and and then he kind of you know took a deep breath
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:14.720]  because he realizes what he and his family are facing and he was the guy who
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:18.760]  could have killed bin Laden but was told don't I mean this is such powerful
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:26.560]  information that but I've noticed Sibel you pulled back a little bit because you
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:32.160]  did come out two years ago and say that yeah bin laden was under CIA command
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:37.560]  and guess what again this went completely under reported and you know how I
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:42.800]  mentioned my about my naive stage this was not only with government and
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:47.080]  Congress and the court I did what many whistleblowers do there's this whole
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:51.280]  nonprofit industrial complex they're called themselves whistleblower
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.480]  organization you think they are there to help you you go get to know what's
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:00.080]  going on with these people you you say wait a second for example why would
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:04.920]  Rockefeller Soros and Carnegie's each to give each organization four million
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:09.120]  dollars a year why why do they do they care for whistleblowers are you kidding
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:14.480]  me do they have such great heart so they are funding them because that becomes
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:18.720]  another layer this is the so-called non-governmental even though they are in
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:23.160]  some ways governmental they're under the same shadow government to go and
[02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:27.560]  actually dissuade whistleblowers from putting their story forward they
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:32.880]  actually try to manage and censure whistleblowers and and they are part of
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:37.760]  this whole game this nonprofit industrial complex go look at the funding
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:42.160]  why in the world Rockefeller wants to protect the whistleblower ask yourself
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.800]  the critical thinking that people need to engage in and the same thing with this
[02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:52.000]  book I put all the stuff including the nonprofit industrial complex it is from
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.520]  the beginning to the end book part one book part two Alex that book hopefully
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:01.320]  if this is successful that book will come out it is going to be a fiction
[02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:06.720]  because with fiction I'm not obligated to submit it to the FBI and I'm gonna tell
[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:11.560]  people here's my fiction you go read and draw your own conclusion because what
[02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:15.240]  you've been hearing from the government is fiction therefore if you put out a
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:20.000]  fiction that contradicts government's fiction then what would you call that
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.400]  and that's why I wrote this part one this gives the context from the beginning
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:29.840]  to the end as a whistleblower as what's happening to our nation we have become a
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:34.560]  police state a lot of people they say oh we are descending towards police state
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:38.920]  we are moving towards I keep asking them why do you think you're moving as if
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:42.480]  we haven't gotten there yet no no the media puts that in their mind oh we're
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:48.440]  moving towards one with reeducation camps and in DAA and street lamps that
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:57.760]  listen to you and watch you and citizen spies they are raising the
[02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:01.720]  temperature one degree at a time and they people have gotten used to they go
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:06.280]  like cattle we go through those security line we spread our legs we just open it
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:12.080]  up and we say give it to us that that's what we have become as a nation we are
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:17.760]  losing we have been losing our dignity our liberties and I mean we have become
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:22.600]  nothing and I must be stand up and say no they're doing it with our tax money
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:28.440]  and we're afraid of people that we actually sustain I mean that's ludicrous
[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:33.640]  Alex it's ludicrous and they think oh police the state is gonna be just
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:39.040]  really a separate the state that if we enter that stage at a state everybody's
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:42.480]  gonna know of your police they people they think I'm being dramatic saying
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:46.400]  police the state then your first amendment is taken away which has been
[02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:50.240]  look at all this was the floor for going to jail see them look at how they're
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:53.240]  announcing they're gonna shut down freedom on the web how they're gonna
[02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:57.560]  again have street lights watching and listening to you drones they've got the
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:02.280]  repair people watching you you know there were websites and there were groups
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:07.400]  that were kind of cheering for me after Obama got elected I have become now
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:12.120]  their enemies they have been slendering my name saying why don't you just live
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:16.760]  it to the George W. Bush and leave Obama out of it as whistleblower as an as a
[02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:19.920]  director of national security whistleblowers coalition I've been saying
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:25.560]  Bush was bad this guy is terrible even with that horrible George W. Bush we
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:29.400]  didn't have a single whistleblower prosecuted just take a look at what
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:34.840]  this man has been doing we have had seven Alex seven government whistleblowers
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:39.520]  are being prosecuted for exposing government crime which which is the
[02:46:39.520 --> 02:46:44.000]  height of corruption and again Bush didn't persecute whistleblowers not
[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.880]  because he was a nice guy he knew he couldn't get away with it but in comes
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:53.720]  Obama and I've seen him on the news go good you expose corruption Democrats are
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:58.440]  like send him to jail as if Obama is the government and as if because they
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:02.600]  support him now they're part of the winning team you got it Alex I guess
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:11.000]  what else they did they gave Obama last year transparency award and the
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.720]  meeting the award was classified they made sure it was secret the ceremony
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:20.200]  they gave that's right that's right the award ceremony for transparency the
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:24.240]  secret as a sick joke he has the most secret he said he wouldn't have signing
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:27.200]  statements signs the most said he would give you five days for people to read
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:31.600]  the bills accelerates it secretly through says he isn't friend EA turns out
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:35.960]  he demanded it right says he won't sign it so people don't have opposition to it
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:41.480]  then does sign it I mean total deception showing there are no two parties at the
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:45.880]  top we have been hijacked by Goldman Sachs
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:51.160]  and there's two party system all the stuff they're putting there they get
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:54.760]  two of their own candidates because there is no Democrats or Republican with
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:59.560]  these criminals and the mob it's the same it's the same side of the coin one is
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:04.320]  called the other one and they say we give you two choices or options and you
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:08.200]  choose between the two choices it presents you and we're gonna call that
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:14.200]  we're gonna coin that democracy let's expand on that talk about the sex
[02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:19.520]  trafficking weapon trafficking money laundering that al-Qaeda is used to do
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:23.120]  because it's in the news the NATO is training a giant al-Qaeda force at the
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:31.640]  old Kosovo training bases to jihadi invade just like Libya into Syria and
[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:36.760]  they've said the Christians and Jews are dead but again you're not a patriot if
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:40.760]  you don't want the Christians and Jews to all be killed now I'm not familiar with
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:47.280]  sex trafficking aspects of it but as far as heroin goes absolutely and Turkey
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:52.320]  has been our number one partner to get a lot of this done because it's true
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:57.600]  Turkey that it gets to be distributed to you know go to UK and you're not gonna
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:01.920]  believe this do you know where is the top distribution center after Turkey when
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:08.040]  it goes to the rest of Europe Belgium are you ask yourself why Belgium oh
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.240]  that's because they've always been the gun dealers in in Africa and everywhere
[02:49:11.240 --> 02:49:19.280]  else yes and that's what it is and then you go anybody who has tried to expose
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:24.320]  this has been suffocated one way or another either literally suffocated or
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:28.880]  they they have been just marginalized put aside because they cannot have a
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:33.000]  career and again you're seeing all the NSA communicates on this you know the
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  point is is that they don't hide it now see bell I mean have you seen Fox singing
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:41.600]  and all the channels go yeah the troops help grow the opium we we loaded on
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:45.680]  aircraft and fly it out uh-huh patriotic you're not for al-Qaeda are you we
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:49.760]  find al-Qaeda by shipping it out mm-hmm they literally say we find al-Qaeda well
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.600]  you've got to ask me to have as a nation have we become that dumb I'm sorry to use
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:58.680]  that word thing as a nation we are becoming dumb and desensitized that
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:02.320]  they can actually spread it in front of us put it there and we don't react any
[02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:07.760]  longer as I said if we can go every day millions of us and get bundled and stop
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:11.480]  reacting they can get oh they're saying now we're gonna hide it in our body
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:16.160]  cavities I told my husband I said I can't no no no they're gonna grab you
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:19.880]  with cops and when your kids cry that's gonna be bad and you're gonna

[02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:24.840]  I was looking at articles I see these all the time around the country these new
[02:54:24.840 --> 02:54:27.960]  checkpoints are setting up they do a lot of them in Tennessee because they see
[02:54:27.960 --> 02:54:33.920]  that as an enemy population that may revolt at these new TSA checkpoints
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:38.280]  they have the local police rob your wallet and as little as $500 is seen as
[02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:44.360]  illegal there's no law but they say no judge no jury you can't prove again one
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:47.760]  case in Texas with the state police years ago the woman had been at the bank
[02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:51.480]  it was like $4,000 she even had the receipt that it was they said it's gone
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:56.000]  lady and if you argue they go ahead and just take your car and impound it to and

[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:17.760]  this could happen to them I absolutely would not believe it could happen in

[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:52.880]  journalists that talk to whistleblowers so maybe I'll get in trouble by the
[02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:55.800]  narcotics trafficking murdering government that's using our money against
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:00.480]  this we may be laughing right now but I won't be surprised because how things
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:05.280]  have been escalating nonstop and by getting this book by reading it by
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:09.320]  letting other people know people will be standing up for the freedom of
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:14.160]  speech for the First Amendment and also it is raising awareness because so many
[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:18.600]  people and I tested this I gave it to people who were not activists they
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:21.920]  really you know they are the ones who tune into the mainstream media and watch
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:25.360]  dancing under the stars or whatever is that show I don't even have TV in my
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:32.840]  house and and they read oh I had no idea how corrupt and awful I am just shocked
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.640]  because to me just read like fiction ma'am all over the country now the police
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:43.160]  pull you over and in some cases take as little as $500 and I mean from old
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:46.320]  ladies they're not even taking it from my gangbangers it's bad enough I mean
[02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:50.040]  well this country is burning down right now
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:55.960]  so yes please for the listeners get this book read it and and and become and
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:57:00.880]  become active put the word out and say as long as we take it they are going to
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:05.120]  escalate it there's only one solution and that is for us to stand up for our
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:09.720]  own right and I tell whistleblowers don't go to Congress anymore there is one
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:13.760]  way and that is the real revolution to bring about revolution don't write
[02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:18.520]  petition to Congress I was dumb enough to do that and waste time for years even
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:22.680]  when you and I talk last time Alex four or five years ago I believe that if I
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:26.800]  got hundred thousand people petitioning the Congress something was gonna happen
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:32.280]  today I tell them don't wait your time you got a few good people up there but
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:38.400]  the rest of them are involved in the in the in the drug trafficking there's
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:43.040]  the criminals I'm sorry that's because they are and that's one of the things
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:48.000]  the book gets into of the dozens of congressional people exposing this
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.600]  criminal ring they're there on the pocket of foreign lobby and the heroin
