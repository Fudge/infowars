[08:52.840 --> 09:00.600]  inner think tank of the Rand Corporation which is the the the upper tower of the
[09:00.600 --> 09:07.480]  globalist eugenics mass murder complex super hardcore information coming up on
[09:07.480 --> 09:13.320]  that front you can see photos that folks were able to snap of Queen Beatrix and
[09:13.320 --> 09:20.840]  of course Henry Kissinger and others all up at info wars.com big things are
[09:20.840 --> 09:26.840]  happening the the facade that is Bilderberg the facade that global
[09:26.840 --> 09:30.640]  government shadowy corporate interest controlling government using it to
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.880]  shut down freedom and and steal resources the facade the lie that that
[09:35.880 --> 09:40.320]  doesn't exist and crazy people talk about common sense historical facts is
[09:40.320 --> 09:47.000]  imploding because the dinosaur trader media collaborator media for the last
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.040]  really 80 years or so has sat there and lied to the American people the
[09:51.040 --> 09:54.840]  robber barons bought it up in the last hundred years accelerating the last 80
[09:54.840 --> 09:58.040]  years so since the 1930s they engineered the depression that's been
[09:58.040 --> 10:02.320]  declassified to try to get government control over America get us into social
[10:02.320 --> 10:08.520]  security make us dependent basically in-state rights and they've taken over
[10:08.520 --> 10:13.120]  our society but they haven't fully taken over our minds we can always awaken
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.680]  from that trance here is the huge news up at info wars.com EPA using drones to
[10:19.680 --> 10:25.440]  spy on cattle ranchers in Nebraska and Iowa that's curtain ammo the 30,000
[10:25.440 --> 10:32.760]  drones we've got Bilderberg members label protesters cockroaches Charlie
[10:32.760 --> 10:37.000]  Skelton was able to talk to some of the hotel staff indeed they're cursing the
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.640]  protesters because they get yelled at by them talking about how they want to
[10:40.640 --> 10:44.840]  kill Ron Paul kill the protesters kill the Americans that are aware that the
[10:44.840 --> 10:49.480]  criminals are meeting inside they're guarded by Marines illegally that's
[10:49.480 --> 10:54.800]  confirmed Marines driving around with their Marine Corps plates running
[10:54.800 --> 11:01.280]  security just absolute criminal activity and then that segues into this piece of
[11:01.280 --> 11:05.600]  news that I think is probably the most important today up at info wars.com CFR
[11:05.600 --> 11:12.600]  proposes using army to enforce domestic law now they've gotten rid of Posse
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.360]  commentators in everything but name we got documents and got video in the late
[11:17.360 --> 11:23.600]  90s with Marine Corps regular Army National Guard checkpoints just in Texas
[11:23.600 --> 11:27.080]  the middle of Texas all over the country as well we got footage in Hebron
[11:27.080 --> 11:32.600]  Maryland the list goes on and on Alabama California Michigan Marines will come
[11:32.600 --> 11:36.840]  over with guns in the middle of towns like Hebron Maryland say turn your
[11:36.840 --> 11:41.960]  camera off with the police but Marines with guns will start pointing them at
[11:41.960 --> 11:47.240]  people I've had the army come up with side arms on and and say turn your
[11:47.240 --> 11:52.680]  cameras off in America so they keep telling you it's for terrorist but the
[11:52.680 --> 11:59.960]  army general goes on writing forward the council on farm relations they go on in
[11:59.960 --> 12:07.360]  the report and they say that oh we need the police to be able to call us in for
[12:07.360 --> 12:13.800]  any reason well that's what's been going on by stealth forever that's what's been
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.120]  happening by stealth I mean I kept saying there's urban warfare drills the
[12:18.120 --> 12:23.680]  military is dressing up in in generic police uniforms in Norfolk Virginia
[12:23.680 --> 12:30.840]  documents witnesses confirmed in Dallas Texas in the in Houston they're
[12:30.840 --> 12:35.280]  they're raiding gun dealers homes they're they're raiding farmers that won't give
[12:35.280 --> 12:38.920]  their property up the army is already engaging and pulling triggers and killing
[12:38.920 --> 12:42.200]  us citizens they did it at Waco that's been declassified in congressional
[12:42.200 --> 12:46.000]  hearings and they're like oh yeah right in the Martians are gonna get us well
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.960]  now they admit the FEMA camps now they admit the reeducation centers but
[12:49.960 --> 12:54.480]  they're like it's for your own good there's a giant arms race with our money
[12:54.480 --> 12:59.000]  against us and our military is not our military anymore that's not figure of
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.840]  speech it openly is under UN NATO treason command we've been infiltrated we
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.160]  were taken down and if you're a new listener just check that out but you've
[13:09.160 --> 13:14.280]  got to get the military informed here you've seen the cases in New York where
[13:14.280 --> 13:20.080]  a woman here's my show and here's that her local base has a emergency internment
[13:20.080 --> 13:23.640]  facility it's listed in the civilian inmate labor camp program of this two
[13:23.640 --> 13:29.920]  years ago she goes out there and starts video taping from the front gate they
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.160]  come she legally has a shotgun in her trunk they take her to jail and last
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.800]  time I heard the army hadn't released her I mean the army grabbed a woman with
[13:38.800 --> 13:45.960]  no criminal record who went out and Fox is like good good they got her again
[13:45.960 --> 13:49.840]  you're trained on the bait of the foreigner that in a primitive level men
[13:49.840 --> 13:52.360]  are designed to see you know the you know the clan over the hill is the
[13:52.360 --> 13:54.920]  enemy they say look at these guys they don't dress like us they look like us
[13:54.920 --> 13:57.880]  they're gonna get you they're al-qaeda meanwhile al-qaeda really works for the
[13:57.880 --> 14:02.280]  banksters on record now all the major al-qaeda leaders even mainstream news
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.400]  admits me at the Pentagon the 9-11 mastermind 7 7 a SWAT all of it it's
[14:07.400 --> 14:14.080]  all a fraud and that's the key here this is premeditated I told you all this
[14:14.080 --> 14:18.360]  was coming now they say it's here but only because things are collapsing I
[14:18.360 --> 14:27.920]  mean look at USA today America's yes but economy the recession officially into
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.160]  three years ago but the recovery has been a frustrating mix of good and bad
[14:31.160 --> 14:36.800]  news I mean this is like Pravda the old Soviet Union this is cartoon level the
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.680]  next article states way motorist taxes one idea charged for miles driven then
[14:42.680 --> 14:45.880]  they go into an ounce oh it's actually being done it's all written to be
[14:45.880 --> 14:50.560]  non-threatening and they said we're not getting as much tax money off gas you
[14:50.560 --> 14:53.200]  look go look at the actual numbers there we're using more fuel than ever
[14:53.200 --> 14:57.560]  they're getting more taxes than ever it's just a pure lie and they say in the
[14:57.560 --> 15:01.200]  USA today everyone will have tracker chips by the state authority under
[15:01.200 --> 15:04.520]  federal control that will track you doesn't matter all the new cars are
[15:04.520 --> 15:09.640]  coming out with it anyways folks this is all a a literal panopticon
[15:09.640 --> 15:16.560]  technocratic takeover in their own words and that's been preplanned for a long

[24:39.040 --> 24:44.320]  coming up Jim Mars and more look it's very simple we have to identify the
[24:44.320 --> 24:48.960]  shadow government and we have to identify the hijackers the usurpers of
[24:48.960 --> 24:54.520]  our nation's mindset their program their plan its scientific dictatorship as a
[24:54.520 --> 24:59.720]  means to exterminate their their their more internal documents and more
[24:59.720 --> 25:04.440]  esoteric documents say about 99% publicly you in biological diversity
[25:04.440 --> 25:09.760]  assessment 96 all the globalists they say 80 to 90 because I don't want to tell
[25:09.760 --> 25:12.560]  the professors and the minions that are all into this I mean go to any
[25:12.560 --> 25:15.520]  university around you most of them are like yes kill everyone they feel real
[25:15.520 --> 25:20.320]  special these are very sick people they're anti-human they're in these
[25:20.320 --> 25:24.520]  weird mutual adoration clubs with each other it's very simple you don't
[25:24.520 --> 25:27.360]  progress in the universities unless you're a eugenicist just like you
[25:27.360 --> 25:30.920]  don't progress as a police officer unless you're a sadomasochistic you know
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.760]  person enjoys raw power and following orders there's plenty of good cops but
[25:35.760 --> 25:38.760]  they're outright in tickets and generally get out of their work because they
[25:38.760 --> 25:43.240]  find it unfulfilling do you understand ladies and gentlemen this is real
[25:43.240 --> 25:47.160]  they're going to kill everybody you know I mean I'm again you've seen all the
[25:47.160 --> 25:51.040]  preparations that I told you would unfold happen exactly as I said because
[25:51.040 --> 25:56.280]  it's all CFR it's all federal reserve it's all you in it's all ran
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.720]  corporation and Hudson Institute I mean Aaron is in there with just hundreds of
[26:00.720 --> 26:03.520]  documents right now we were given a bunch of Bilderberg documents from a
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.920]  government leaker it's just it's just it's so overwhelming and you see people
[26:07.920 --> 26:11.160]  asleep and you want to warn them you want to tell them you want to do
[26:11.160 --> 26:14.720]  something I love humanity I love all the innocent people I see it makes me
[26:14.720 --> 26:19.280]  upset they're going public and see children now and people like oh you're
[26:19.280 --> 26:27.320]  so good to care so good to care what we're being murdered here now I want to
[26:27.320 --> 26:32.280]  go to a report that's up on the drugs report if you go to the drugs report my
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.040]  wife and children are really tickled by this because they like the drugs report
[26:35.040 --> 26:41.000]  they also like wired magazine online so my wife only sites constantly I guess
[26:41.000 --> 26:45.080]  everybody yes but you know big image of myself protesting the Fed a few years
[26:45.080 --> 26:47.800]  ago I guess it's only protest image they have it's pretty good and it says
[26:47.800 --> 26:53.160]  Bilderberg 2012 protesters hail their hero Alex Jones and it's a very fair
[26:53.160 --> 27:05.000]  London Guardian report by Ryan Devereux I hope I'm pronouncing that right and it
[27:05.000 --> 27:13.360]  goes over the fact that that well it's it's a pretty powerful article it's not
[27:13.360 --> 27:20.480]  just about Alex Jones it's about the fact that Bilderberg is being exposed
[27:20.480 --> 27:25.120]  that there's a wide-ranging movement against global government developing
[27:25.120 --> 27:30.440]  and unfolding I mean these globalist ladies and gentlemen are so cynical
[27:30.440 --> 27:35.360]  it's like Bono he's a Bill and Melinda Gates front he admits he is he gives
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.320]  right at 1.3% of the money he raises for quote African children to them and
[27:40.320 --> 27:44.080]  with it his strings attached to be sterilized and everything else I mean
[27:44.080 --> 27:50.000]  it's hellish and people like oh isn't he humanitarian it's all a sick joke I go
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.360]  back to this article that is at info wars.com where they are talking about
[27:56.360 --> 28:03.320]  how we're cockroaches and I've been told by Hispanic journalists from Mexico and
[28:03.320 --> 28:08.120]  I went looked it up that is the case that's what the elites down there have
[28:08.120 --> 28:12.120]  called the Indians which are you know people who don't have a lot of European
[28:12.120 --> 28:18.600]  blood in them they call them the cockroaches and if you watch the Mexican
[28:18.600 --> 28:24.680]  Congress it's all like six foot three people with blonde hair blue eyes I mean
[28:24.680 --> 28:28.480]  Vicente Fox is about as dark as people get in that government and he's looks
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.440]  like a pure Spaniard and I mean there's all about non-interpreting with anybody
[28:33.440 --> 28:37.120]  that's not a Spaniard and it's it's all there and they call the people
[28:37.120 --> 28:41.440]  cockroaches and then they fund the Ford Foundation to try to teach anybody who's
[28:41.440 --> 28:47.520]  Hispanic you know Spanish descent and native is really what it is you know
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.560]  Native American they try to teach him that you know hate freedom hate guns
[28:51.560 --> 28:55.720]  families bad all this garbage and you're gonna bring down America well it's the
[28:55.720 --> 28:58.640]  very globalist that have brought down your country you know they bragged at
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.480]  Walmart's deindustrializing Mexico and ruining all the local businesses too
[29:02.480 --> 29:08.440]  that's in USA today they're very very proud of that so so this is the system
[29:08.440 --> 29:17.040]  we're facing and they see us as cockroaches and they love the fact that
[29:17.040 --> 29:23.320]  it's all mammals fed the BT corn other systems are completely it's like 99
[29:23.320 --> 29:28.280]  plus percent sterilized mutations organs on the outside of their body hair
[29:28.280 --> 29:31.200]  growing in their mouths and we're starting to see this happen with us I
[29:31.200 --> 29:34.560]  mean they're murdering us folks you're being murdered right now about these
[29:34.560 --> 29:38.080]  people all of you that serve them we're all being murdered I mean they are
[29:38.080 --> 29:42.960]  murdering us they see us as cockroaches I got news for you you're the cockroaches
[29:42.960 --> 29:46.080]  globalist that's why you've got all these underground bases so when you release

[33:32.960 --> 33:37.160]  Bilderberg coverage as we identify the enemy the usurpers the covert
[33:37.160 --> 33:41.720]  infiltrators that are now trying to normalize yeah the armies on the
[33:41.720 --> 33:46.200]  streets to take you on you're a terrorist so the local police can quote
[33:46.200 --> 33:50.280]  call in airstrikes that's in the CFR document and they're all started with oh
[33:50.280 --> 33:55.800]  20 years ago plus covert operations defusing bombs but don't scare the
[33:55.800 --> 33:59.920]  public police the armies here and they're gonna wear generic police
[33:59.920 --> 34:05.680]  uniforms you're part of the secret club now yeah violating Posse Comintatus the
[34:05.680 --> 34:09.640]  national security state did this illegally then they told you it was for
[34:09.640 --> 34:15.080]  al-Qaeda with the public rollout after 9-11 that they staged now they're
[34:15.080 --> 34:19.200]  shifting away from al-Qaeda they publicly run to yeah the army is gonna be part of
[34:19.200 --> 34:25.720]  rural affairs council and it's gonna be in your town plainclothes military and I
[34:25.720 --> 34:30.080]  faced them at Bilderberg and we have footage from heaven Maryland in police
[34:30.080 --> 34:36.280]  state 2000 of 10 11 and 12 year olds in white shirts the Boy Scouts going in
[34:36.280 --> 34:40.400]  their parents houses and coming back to the Marines in plainclothes and in
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.240]  full garb and telling them what guns they had and they said oh it's just part
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.520]  of a fun drill just like Arcadia Iowa that was in the newspaper yeah they're
[34:48.520 --> 34:51.560]  doing door-to-door gun confiscation drills I come out and pointed out hey
[34:51.560 --> 34:54.240]  the paper says door-to-door gun confiscation drills they practice
[34:54.240 --> 34:58.120]  rating the gun shops but the gun shop owner says he was helping and he's mad
[34:58.120 --> 35:01.600]  at me for being a conspiracy theorist they admit they're training to take over
[35:01.600 --> 35:06.200]  our gun shops and door-to-door gun confiscation in the Arcadia newspaper and
[35:06.200 --> 35:11.600]  I had the Colonel on but then I'm bad because I didn't like it and they
[35:11.600 --> 35:16.120]  suddenly went well this is for Iraq oh yeah sure it is like Katrina was ladies
[35:16.120 --> 35:19.600]  and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen you've got to talk to the military now
[35:19.600 --> 35:24.000]  about this you got to talk to the police you got to decide what side you're on
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.520]  when I talked to the police at Bilderberg it was one of the head guys
[35:30.520 --> 35:35.280]  there was the head of the SWAT team four years ago and he was there for riot
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.640]  control he was like the head guy over that was the name Lee like first name
[35:39.640 --> 35:42.600]  he says it on tape he's the cop comes over and says yeah I listen to your show
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.720]  I like it and then later he got in trouble he said don't talk to me later we
[35:45.720 --> 35:49.320]  talked to him and he said and we talked some of the other guys later the whole
[35:49.320 --> 35:53.480]  SWAT team listens there in Fairfax County a large numbers of the police did
[35:53.480 --> 35:56.880]  know we were four years ago after bullhorring four days they were riding
[35:56.880 --> 36:00.600]  it all down and looking it up this time as I was born and they were sitting there
[36:00.600 --> 36:05.360]  with iPads looking it up and I said look up the Secretary of Defense say on the
[36:05.360 --> 36:09.240]  UN and NATO command the military not Congress an hour later they were going
[36:09.240 --> 36:13.440]  my god it's true I said okay now look this up and other cops go and see he
[36:13.440 --> 36:16.560]  told you didn't they send out these higher up guys who try to start fights
[36:16.560 --> 36:19.720]  they would they would call the cops out to get in front of us for no reason and
[36:19.720 --> 36:23.640]  then threaten people I dare you to step on the street again and the other cops
[36:23.640 --> 36:27.480]  are like don't do it we'll get in trouble if we don't arrest you I mean it was I
[36:27.480 --> 36:32.000]  could see the whole thing right there and the head cops they to bring in like
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.480]  the head guys and like full dress uniforms were flipping out we're flipping
[36:37.480 --> 36:41.640]  out that the police were all waking up and by the end we're like who supports
[36:41.640 --> 36:44.200]  Constitution police were raising their hands they come over the Guardian
[36:44.200 --> 36:47.160]  reporters see not just me and said oh yeah we ate Builder Bird we know they're
[36:47.160 --> 36:52.720]  evil it's happening it's happening it's happening you can do it in your area it's
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.000]  an emergency situation before they set off nukes or something and blaming on
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.760]  Patriot groups this is real they plan reeducation mass arrest I'm getting total
[37:01.760 --> 37:05.480]  chills right now we can defeat these people that's what's so frustrating but
[37:05.480 --> 37:09.800]  you've got to get involved yourself it's not just Alex Jones people say oh
[37:09.800 --> 37:13.480]  you're so brave they could kill you I could care less ladies and gentlemen I
[37:13.480 --> 37:18.640]  love my life I love my family but there's no future if we don't beat them
[37:18.640 --> 37:22.160]  there's not a choice you understand that's why I was going to my thought
[37:22.160 --> 37:27.360]  process you can understand it there isn't a choice it's real look at it look
[37:27.360 --> 37:31.680]  it up find out it's so much more horrible Aaron who's somebody who never cusses
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.280]  stomped around the bus all yesterday and last night couldn't go to bed till like
[37:36.280 --> 37:39.320]  three in the morning because he was finding more and more documents and
[37:39.320 --> 37:44.160]  ran corporation all Bilderberg all eugenics poisoning the food blood with
[37:44.160 --> 37:48.480]  HIV in it for little kids the hemophiliacs mass murder death killing
[37:48.480 --> 37:54.840]  Eli Lilly all of it I mean it is so incredible what they've done to us and I
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.320]  know I'm ranting Mike Adams is going to be again doing the second half of the
[37:59.320 --> 38:03.680]  show today he's here doing traffic control right now with us Mike I want to
[38:03.680 --> 38:06.520]  run through some more we've got Aaron coming in with a breakdown on Mitch
[38:06.520 --> 38:11.760]  Daniels in the next segment but but but but seeing all of this this lawless
[38:11.760 --> 38:15.840]  government openly declaring war on us openly saying yeah we spawn you without
[38:15.840 --> 38:19.320]  warrants yeah there's drones in the skies yeah we're delivering armored tanks to
[38:19.320 --> 38:22.520]  local police departments yeah we're gearing up for war with you now yeah
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.000]  we're getting armored pillboxes for the highways yeah we're buying four four
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.960]  hundred and fifty million rounds of 40 cal yeah we're doing it I mean it is on
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.000]  they are getting ready Mike it's coming soon and we've got to absolutely get the
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.560]  word out like Paul Revere's of every race color creed and religion and male
[38:40.560 --> 38:44.920]  female you name it we have all got to do maximum effort right now and we can back
[38:44.920 --> 38:48.920]  them off but once they pull the trigger on this Mike it is going to be one
[38:48.920 --> 38:53.160]  bloody civil war I'm gonna get arrested you're gonna get arrested it's gonna be
[38:53.160 --> 38:57.040]  dead cops and military everywhere the next wave plan is public they're gonna
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.680]  bring in I for NATO they're telling the military this hell on earth is about to
[39:01.680 --> 39:05.920]  be released we are in an emergency brinksmanship operation we've got just
[39:05.920 --> 39:10.600]  110 percent pedal to the metal hammer in against these people in the info war
[39:10.600 --> 39:14.200]  and it may be like the Alamos some of us may get wiped out up front but that's
[39:14.200 --> 39:17.320]  what it takes to win against these people there is no future if they're not
[39:17.320 --> 39:23.560]  defeated info war 110 percent what do you say Mike Adams I say this is real
[39:23.560 --> 39:27.600]  everybody what you are watching what you were witnessing I believe this is the
[39:27.600 --> 39:30.880]  most important transmission taking place right now anywhere on the planet
[39:30.880 --> 39:36.840]  what info wars has put out what Alex is telling you is real I concur with his
[39:36.840 --> 39:41.600]  analysis and the breaking news that he's been bringing us but look look at
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.840]  what's happening because this is being exposed because of the work of info wars
[39:45.840 --> 39:48.240]  and all the supporters and all the people out there who are helping to
[39:48.240 --> 39:52.320]  expose this and this is my question to you Alex I'd like your analysis on this
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.280]  is the so-called global elite and again I hate using that word elite because
[39:57.280 --> 40:01.960]  they're more like global scum is the global scum planning on accelerating
[40:01.960 --> 40:06.560]  their own timetable because of the awakening and and and the second
[40:06.560 --> 40:13.480]  exactly go ahead go ahead no no they are they have put so much in motion they
[40:13.480 --> 40:17.520]  can't even probably fully stop it themselves and analyzing them they're
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.600]  scared now but they're still arrogant and so used to winning that they they are
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.720]  still rolling forward and they have got to know that we see them we know who they
[40:28.720 --> 40:34.280]  are we know who to blame and again when government fears the people there is
[40:34.280 --> 40:37.240]  liberty when the people fear the government there is tyranny and let me
[40:37.240 --> 40:40.640]  tell you there were a lot of people out there packing heat there are people out
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.720]  there with 44 mags you name it open carry again that's one of the biggest
[40:44.720 --> 40:48.240]  revolutions is the open carry thousands have been arrested doing it even though
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.680]  it's legal and every statement a few cities like New York and the fact that
[40:52.680 --> 40:56.520]  that was happening too that the Bilderbergs hate that look you're not
[40:56.520 --> 40:59.760]  getting our guns even if you ban them you're not stopping us if you want the
[40:59.760 --> 41:03.760]  Civil War go ahead and try it and we were there peaceful but the fact that
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.400]  Bilderberg understands they are having an attack on real humans that they are
[41:08.400 --> 41:13.680]  savagely attacking us and humanity at an instinctive level is activating right
[41:13.680 --> 41:16.800]  now well the other it's happening and the other the other were were some red
[41:16.800 --> 41:20.400]  flag the big sign that came out of this there was talk a Jim Tucker reported
[41:20.400 --> 41:25.080]  there was talk of within the Bilderberg group in inside the hotel there of
[41:25.080 --> 41:31.320]  wishing that Ron Paul would die there's talk of of murdering people murdering
[41:31.320 --> 41:34.800]  the protesters treating them like cockroaches crushing them there's now
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.880]  this this this sort of open hatred which is of course a reflection of their core
[41:39.880 --> 41:44.640]  philosophy of eugenics which gets into GMOs it gets in the war I don't listen
[41:44.640 --> 41:49.440]  listen listen we had people all around the building bullhornings so loud I got
[41:49.440 --> 41:52.680]  migraine headaches you can see one of the videos having to go to my knees with
[41:52.680 --> 41:58.680]  daisy chain 10 15 20 bullhorns going so loud in unison feeding them daisy
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.920]  chaining that the windows were shaking the Bilderberg members and there were
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.240]  coming out with their mouths hanging up and they were they heard it and I mean
[42:06.240 --> 42:09.680]  this was guttural there were other people they're just like we were just
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.760]  I mean it was you they knew they knew they understood Kissinger looked freaked
[42:13.760 --> 42:17.400]  out Beatrice looked freaked out and they should you're killing us we don't have
[42:17.400 --> 42:22.040]  any choice we're all in we get it okay the chips are down we understand it most
[42:22.040 --> 42:24.760]  of us aren't going to make it through this we know you've got the super bio
[42:24.760 --> 42:28.000]  weapons the underground bases we know you're already killing a soft kill the
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.840]  hot kills coming we're committed we understand there's no future if we
[42:31.840 --> 42:35.560]  don't expose you okay we get it you want to just quietly kill us and have your
[42:35.560 --> 42:39.960]  deindustrialization walmart's go in got article right here at a u.s.a. today or
[42:39.960 --> 42:42.920]  they admit walmart is paying off the officials but they say that's the
[42:42.920 --> 42:47.800]  American way and the Mexican government makes everybody use smart cards now so
[42:47.800 --> 42:51.200]  all the little shops can't get their business and they're taking over and
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.880]  shutting everything down they're now the biggest company in Mexico I mean this is
[42:56.880 --> 43:01.040]  the deindustrializer this is the global takeover using Chinese slave goods to
[43:01.040 --> 43:04.960]  leverage the planet this is a strategic ran corporation scientific
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.080]  dictatorship program that's why they're shutting down the Amish that's why
[43:09.080 --> 43:11.800]  they're attacking people selling peaches on the side of the road they know
[43:11.800 --> 43:15.960]  humans are figuring it out and trying to run to the hills trying to everybody
[43:15.960 --> 43:20.200]  ish trying to get back to basics instinctively the human survival instinct
[43:20.200 --> 43:25.800]  despite all the fluoride the poison the GMO of the attacks the human emergency
[43:25.800 --> 43:29.880]  survival mechanism that they've tried to shut off I meant by saying humans are
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.400]  bad we hurt the earth that's only at a conscious level subconsciously the will
[43:34.400 --> 43:39.680]  to survive is now activating and I'm telling you I'm telling you even with
[43:39.680 --> 43:46.880]  mainstream media being there they even the guardian people were were were were
[43:46.880 --> 43:49.880]  sold on the fight against the New World Order now because of the facts they saw
[43:49.880 --> 43:55.240]  two different writers the Washington Times you see once once some of the
[43:55.240 --> 43:59.560]  mainline media starts reporting it forced all the others and it's the same
[43:59.560 --> 44:04.360]  thing this is how the dominoes start falling this is how we have our Trenton
[44:04.360 --> 44:09.760]  New Jersey victories in the Info War and and now force all this out this is big
[44:09.760 --> 44:13.240]  Mike and they're probably gonna do some counter strikes very very soon it's
[44:13.240 --> 44:17.640]  huge this is big but one of the things that you demonstrated now observing
[44:17.640 --> 44:21.720]  your activities there your bull bullhorning the protests everything that
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.760]  took place over the weekend from from from an outside perspective one of the
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.680]  key things that you demonstrated was that aggressiveness works because the
[44:30.680 --> 44:35.760]  global elite and those who are guarding them are actually cowards so when when
[44:35.760 --> 44:39.200]  you were aggressive but not violent and I want to point that out you were
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.360]  aggressive in talking to the police officers there in asserting your own
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.000]  rights you were able to do things that shocked other people remember when you
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.480]  just cross the street you cross the street and the crowds were cheering
[44:49.480 --> 44:52.400]  because the cops there were saying you can't cross the street and when you got
[44:52.400 --> 44:55.520]  to the other side you said wow it's the new the new standard of freedom is in
[44:55.520 --> 44:58.560]  America is that we can cross the street now without getting arrested well again
[44:58.560 --> 45:02.200]  the reason what happened with the police is I walked over the Guardian couldn't
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.000]  hear it but it was on live stream I'm recording of it and they're like look
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.640]  we're being ordered to do this they're watching right now on the video camera
[45:09.640 --> 45:14.680]  across the street and I said it doesn't matter this is a side street would you
[45:14.680 --> 45:17.640]  on a normal day stop somebody here I've looked at the code I actually looked it
[45:17.640 --> 45:21.600]  up they've been doing it you know that this isn't a law and I said I said is
[45:21.600 --> 45:24.080]  this really what you want for your children and then the cops just said
[45:24.080 --> 45:27.520]  that cross the street I mean look it's real simple hey you want your kids to
[45:27.520 --> 45:32.040]  live like this buddy you want to live in North Korea I mean the truth is that the
[45:32.040 --> 45:36.000]  cops were all there including senior ones captains and people saying there's
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.840]  audio and video we're being watched if we don't do this we get in trouble and I
[45:39.840 --> 45:42.960]  said I said to the cops I said well so you're just gonna do whatever you're
[45:42.960 --> 45:46.560]  told and they said no we're not you can cross the street and I looked at them and
[45:46.560 --> 45:49.800]  I said that shouldn't have been a big jump for you I said the new standard of
[45:49.800 --> 45:53.440]  freedom is we can cross the street in America this is worse than North Korea
[45:53.440 --> 45:56.600]  I didn't say oh thank you like some of the folks in the crowd did that they
[45:56.600 --> 46:01.400]  weren't bad I'm like look this is a very sad moment that you had to refuse
[46:01.400 --> 46:06.200]  orders and let us cross a legal little side street and I said by the way you've
[46:06.200 --> 46:10.760]  got this pushed all the way out to the major road where it's dangerous you're
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.040]  telling people to cross the street and go around the other side just to make
[46:14.040 --> 46:17.960]  people do what you want your higher-ups are gonna get somebody killed and the
[46:17.960 --> 46:21.680]  cops looked at me and they said he's right move the cars back move the line
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.600]  back everybody can cross the street I mean I talked to them like they were
[46:25.600 --> 46:29.600]  humans and I said do you really want to live in a country like this and I'm
[46:29.600 --> 46:33.200]  right there with the commanders on a big surveillance pod right across the
[46:33.200 --> 46:37.680]  street watching their own police and I just said so this is what you're gonna
[46:37.680 --> 46:43.120]  do and again if somebody's got any humanity left this story of the police
[46:43.120 --> 46:48.240]  is a microcosm of every other battle we face when you destroy someone's rights
[46:48.240 --> 46:53.120]  police you're shooting a hole in your own boat okay you notice as the liberties
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.240]  go out the window the prosperity is going on the oxygens leave in the room
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.000]  ladies and gentlemen they're going yeah there are reeducation camps yeah we are
[47:00.000 --> 47:03.680]  listening to without a warrant yeah the UN does run our military yeah we are
[47:03.680 --> 47:06.600]  gonna use troops from foreign countries against Americans this is in the
[47:06.600 --> 47:12.640]  newspapers now Mike I mean I'm even blown away though that we were this right
[47:12.640 --> 47:15.600]  but I guess I was just reading government documents but to see them go
[47:15.600 --> 47:19.800]  ahead and do it it's but this happens in Germany and Russia people can't believe
[47:19.800 --> 47:23.920]  it's happening it's really happening but our forebears with the first amendment
[47:23.920 --> 47:28.320]  the second amendment put in those emergency switches they gave us powers
[47:28.320 --> 47:33.440]  that other countries had not fought for and attained Mike so we have we have
[47:33.440 --> 47:38.520]  these swords and shields we have the weapon the mighty mighty mighty Thor
[47:38.520 --> 47:43.160]  hammer if we use what the founders fought and died for and most of them
[47:43.160 --> 47:46.280]  lost everything they had including their families we have these weapons
[47:46.280 --> 47:53.000]  forged in the fires of liberty but we must use them Mike yeah if you're just
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.160]  tuning in the Alice Jones is speaking here Mike Adams filling in you are
[47:57.160 --> 47:59.960]  watching history in the making I believe one of the most important
[47:59.960 --> 48:04.640]  transmissions I also believe that when the revolution is successful the peaceful
[48:04.640 --> 48:09.320]  revolution of taking back our republic that info wars actions here and what
[48:09.320 --> 48:13.480]  just took place in Chantilly Virginia will be a highlight of the history books
[48:13.480 --> 48:17.680]  and of course if for some reason the revolution doesn't go our way then of
[48:17.680 --> 48:20.680]  course they will write off they will attempt to write off info wars is never
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.680]  existing just as the mainstream media is doing right now we must prevail at
[48:25.680 --> 48:28.960]  least 90% of us are dead if we don't prevail I mean there's not a question
[48:28.960 --> 48:32.640]  folks that's the thing this isn't just some conquering group that wants to run
[48:32.640 --> 48:37.560]  things okay this is a group of scientific crazy people who write
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.440]  thousands of publications how they want to end the family and kill most of us I
[48:41.440 --> 48:45.400]  mean there's no quarter you know when the pirates a white flag means surrender a
[48:45.400 --> 48:50.840]  black flag in history in all major cultures in from Asia to you know the
[48:50.840 --> 48:56.360]  Mediterranean you name it a black flag meant no surrender also meant the plague
[48:56.360 --> 48:59.920]  sometimes mean we're dead ship but a black flag meant no surrender a skull
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.680]  meant in a fight we're also if you don't surrender right away we're gonna kill you
[49:03.680 --> 49:06.560]  so we were not gonna surrender and when we capture you we're gonna kill
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.560]  everybody the globalists are flying a Jolly Roger at us okay and they're
[49:10.560 --> 49:15.000]  saying no quarter given none taken we're going we are killing you we are
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.000]  poisoning you right now we're getting you ready for the real hot killing like
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.560]  they're doing in Africa and in other places in India and there's a cold war
[49:23.560 --> 49:27.680]  against the family it's going hot now they're not giving us quarter there
[49:27.680 --> 49:32.520]  is no choice is what I'm trying to tell people there's only the delusion that
[49:32.520 --> 49:36.320]  you can join the system you know a guy jogged by at the event and gotten
[49:36.320 --> 49:38.920]  people's face that you're a bunch of conspiracy nuts tried to get in a fight
[49:38.920 --> 49:43.000]  some jogger that idiot works for a defense contractor I've guaranteed a
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.040]  system thinks they're God thinks we're idiots thinks that they had Marines
[49:47.040 --> 49:49.960]  driving in and out giving us dirty looks and laughing at us these are these
[49:49.960 --> 49:54.800]  are children these are children they have no idea what they're facing Mike I'm
[49:54.800 --> 49:57.680]  sorry go ahead yeah no well you've studied history so much Alice you speak
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.600]  about it very eloquently on your show here you've seen what happens and it
[50:01.600 --> 50:04.400]  happens over and over again it's a pattern a reliable pattern of what
[50:04.400 --> 50:07.480]  happens when governments get too big and too powerful or fascism takes over
[50:07.480 --> 50:11.920]  corporate intervention with governments so you can see what's happening here and
[50:11.920 --> 50:15.520]  what you're just commenting on there is how other people they delude themselves
[50:15.520 --> 50:19.280]  into believing that somehow this the system is going to be okay as long as
[50:19.280 --> 50:22.760]  they play along with it if they go along they're going to be one one of the
[50:22.760 --> 50:26.800]  minions they're going to be one one of the of the people that gets benefits from
[50:26.800 --> 50:29.720]  the government let's say all they got to do is keep their head low and not speak
[50:29.720 --> 50:36.280]  out but the bigger point here is that now you have proven the effectiveness of
[50:36.280 --> 50:40.880]  speaking out once again and I saw that you were surrounded there at the event
[50:40.880 --> 50:44.320]  you could hardly speak live on the air because of so many people talking to

[56:02.280 --> 56:07.800]  Turner I was wondering if you think it's a good idea to reduce 90% of the
[56:07.800 --> 56:14.400]  population because we are being overpopulated by a lot of 80 Prince
[56:14.400 --> 56:25.320]  Phillips at 80 sir I go with 85 right me too thank you exactly one child
[56:25.320 --> 56:27.880]  policy
[56:29.280 --> 56:33.160]  can you speak about your population control saying you wanted to reduce the
[56:33.160 --> 56:38.840]  population to 95% extermination you said you want a one child policy but you
[56:38.840 --> 56:47.960]  have five kids doesn't make it 40 years old but that's what the Nazis did
[56:47.960 --> 56:52.920]  which is an excerpt sir you want to do humanity hey detail you don't have to
[56:52.920 --> 56:56.520]  I'm not even doing nothing wrong can you tell me what I did wrong you don't have
[56:56.520 --> 56:59.920]  you don't have permission yes I do I have I'm a legitimate person I'm on the
[56:59.920 --> 57:08.480]  list so I'm not even doing that's all legal to Turner your enemy of humanity
[57:08.480 --> 57:12.360]  and you're not like policies won't be tolerated I don't want to give you any
[57:12.360 --> 57:15.320]  trouble I'm just trying to ask my questions this is what I'm trying to do

[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.040]  everything shows that these are these are deceived people as well we are
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:03.320]  fighting pure wickedness pure crystallized death Mike Adams will be
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.240]  taking over fully in about 30 minutes and he's going to have a lot of great
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:12.640]  folks on today like Jim Mars but we've got Aaron Aaron give us your basic
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.240]  breakdown on how important this year's Bilderberg was I mean we're talking about
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.400]  this being a victory it's all over mainstream media but but there's a
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.800]  revolt in the media where the editors can't say no anymore and people are
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.680]  writing positive articles and the media is more and more getting sold on the
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.280]  truth but we see the loyal opposition groups like Beck Tucker Carlson and
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.600]  others show in their true colors Washington Times shows their true
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.080]  colors for patriotism not saying they're perfect drudgereport.com shows their
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.160]  true colors blowing it wide open George Norrie helping do it but then you
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.440]  really learn who's who now don't we oh yeah and it's a classic best of times
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:57.560]  worst of times like any Dickinson era we've blown it wide open the activist
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.320]  community has mobilized that's growing every year I mean it must have been ten
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.960]  times bigger than it's ever been in terms of number of protesters outside the
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.440]  meeting no wonder they see us as cockroaches because they want to quietly
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.920]  move forward on their agenda make sure it's achieved in silence always under
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.320]  the name of world government as they make insider deals get all the land deals
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.680]  all the population and money and wealth for themselves and that's really what
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.680]  these Bilderberg members do I try to focus on studying the list and we see
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.320]  this year they're really mobilizing the architecture is there for World War 3
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.520]  whether or not they actually want that we're gonna find out warfare against us
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.240]  announcing yeah troops are on the street yeah we're watching you yeah drones I
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.240]  mean it's just a full tyrannical declaration of war against humanity well
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.040]  you notice Bill Gates has been under a lot of heat and criticism for his covert
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.920]  war against humanity through his name was always on the list he was there the
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.640]  photograph and stuff the Washington Post had been it is insiders off the list
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.080]  though admitted he was there but off the list but those who are on the list you
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.320]  study him you look up what they're involved with it's extremely telling
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.080]  you'll find their names almost daily in the Wall Street Journal but never
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.760]  mentioning that they coordinate their efforts at Bilderberg but in fact they
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.320]  do decide policy there we've been given a huge data dump of documents we'll talk
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.800]  about that later from back in the 60s when Prince Bernhard was still heading
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.760]  the group he of course had to step down in the 70s because of his own bribery
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.120]  and his world wildlife fund was used as a front to actually hunt elephants and
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.560]  stuff and get gold I mean no end to the level of how wicked these people are
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.720]  well it's not that's that's the point with Ted Turner it's not just that his
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.920]  policies are like Nazis they're working with actual Nazis Prince Bernhard one
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.560]  of them well we're just a eugenics spinoff but it's not even just the eugenics
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.040]  they're seizing up land all the agenda 21 stuff was done under Ted Turner
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.400]  Murray you and lines people up in Latin America and Africa and shoots them I
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.480]  mean this is in the news in the name of the liberals are like murder them it's
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.040]  good in the name of global warming it's all phony your racist if you don't want
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.480]  to kill black people but as you know they were in there not only talking about
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.480]  carbon taxes but the fact that it's Rio plus 20 revisiting agenda 21 under the
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.320]  United Nations they've had a lot of major defeats there's opposition against
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.440]  that they're looking to move that forward and you see more and more of the
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.240]  Rothschild's Rockefellers openly working together whereas there were some
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.680]  in fighting but mostly coordination before and this all just goes on and on
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.800]  but it's very troubling to see so many big-time Russian envoys the head of the
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.360]  Syrian National Council and all these Chinese delegates here they really want
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.760]  to move forward I'm glad we're getting into the agenda on the other side I
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:43.600]  want to break down the vice president that Dolderberg likes what's going on
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.560]  with all of that and more I'm Alex Jones resistance is victory you are
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:55.600]  resistance you are victory realize the threat face the enemy it's the only hope
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:02.440]  we've got we're not heroes we just want to survive hi this is Alex Jones did you

[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.080]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.240]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.160]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.240]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.520]  Jones show this is Mike Adams the health ranger sitting in today at the
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:21.920]  headquarters at Austin Texas Alex Jones and Aaron Dykes are joining us via the
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.540]  road broadcasting from a hotel room they've been on the highway on the the
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:30.740]  road version of the Millennium Falcon the the Info Wars bus and they're
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:34.520]  breaking down the information from Bilderberg which of course is the biggest
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:38.640]  story on the planet right now and yet most of the media absolutely refused to
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.520]  cover it the eugenics agenda is real we just saw an interview with Ted Turner
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.400]  where he confirms that he wants one child policy across the planet for the
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.480]  next hundred years reduced the population to I think two billion people
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.520]  were talking mass death across the planet Alex and Aaron have more
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.960]  information on this front go ahead guys and that's what the carbon taxes in
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.840]  their own numbers what they wanted in Copenhagen two years ago one billion
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.360]  dead in the next ten years in the New York Times admits the UN in Africa in
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.160]  Uganda but also in Latin America and Honduras other areas lines up villagers
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:20.000]  that won't leave from their ancestral land and blows their heads off and and I
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.880]  talked to all the liberal trendies who aren't liberal at all they go well
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:27.360]  there aren't too many people listen idiot your food has been jacked your water
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:32.280]  is you're under attack to you people make me sick that's what Mike Adams
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.640]  exposes now I want to get into the agenda what happened at Bilderberg what
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.160]  we know from the list what we know from sources you know calling us cockroaches
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.480]  wanting us dead this is incredible Aaron Dykes has been barely able to sleep the
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.760]  deeper he goes down the rabbit hole learning even more than I know in many
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.720]  areas constantly researching just how true our analysis is Aaron Dykes what
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.800]  are we facing what do we know from the agenda we're gonna have huge reports when
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.640]  we get back the whole you know giant reports we're just gonna churn out all
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.880]  the documents we've got the Brookings Institute the connections to the Hudson
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.120]  Institute the connection to the Rand Corporation their master plan I mean
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.120]  these people really are incredible psychopaths there's I mean they are
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.160]  they are unbelievable they might as well be a foreign alien force just spilt my
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.240]  water over the electricity hold on but it's so damning Alex I learned more and
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.760]  more as each hour passes by I just keep reading on the road even though it makes
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.400]  me slightly ill because I can't just resist looking up these names and seeing
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:34.240]  the terrible things they're admittedly involved in just last week we found
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.080]  they're putting herbicide in the water contaminating it Bilderberg group but
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.160]  more importantly they have but I mean it's all the Bilderberg group once you
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.120]  know their names you open every newspaper article up and it's just all
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.400]  them ripping us off constant bailouts total criminals telling us the debt is
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.200]  ours I mean these people are filth I'm sorry go ahead I mean to recap what's
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.680]  happened in the past several years in the economic crisis they're admittedly
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.680]  selling us on austerity it's officially on the Bilderberg agenda on their
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.920]  official website meanwhile they put in all their technocrats Mario Monti a
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.480]  top steering committee member of Bilderberg head of Italy Popindrao and
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.160]  the other counterpart in Greece Peter Sutherland who has the air against a
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.880]  red BP and the aliens in fake human bodies this is what they would do I'm
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.080]  not saying that this is who they are that that's a figurative thing before
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.080]  when Beck runs with it but I mean this is so anti-human they might as well be
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.800]  from a distant star I mean sometimes I think it's like a thing episode I mean
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.840]  it's so systematic so crafty so hateful so evil and I just look at the photo
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.960]  my wife sent me my four-year-old with a basket of peaches she picked and she's
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.720]  so innocent and so good and it's beyond hatred I have for these people Aaron
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:47.400]  they are the scum of the earth they are enemy enemy go ahead I know Alex it's
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.040]  so sick what they've done especially respect to humanity but you got to
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.960]  understand while they're selling us on austerity in Europe they're setting the
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.120]  scene to make it happen here in America the pension funds in particular have
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.800]  been bought out by these Bilderberg firms they're getting after they were looted
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:06.520]  already don't buy them correct and they're leveraged on the derivatives
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.320]  market they're leveraged in these terrible buyout schemes and when the
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.160]  dominoes collapse it will all go they're already losing money on the pensions
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:18.480]  and again arrogantly the head of the teachers Texas teachers retirement system
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.240]  officially in attendance at Bilderberg this year my god meets with Henry
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:28.480]  Kravitz of KKR and the other big it was the Texas utilities people four years
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.200]  ago in Istanbul and they sort of shut down the power plants if you weren't
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.960]  insider and literally doubling rate since then I mean these are just Henry
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.880]  Kravitz is one of those angels of death he was part of the largest utilities
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:44.440]  buyout of all time in Texas TXU and there is admitted and that are
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.520]  consolidating the economy to wreck it folks that's the thing they say that's
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:52.640]  their plan city group and Goldman Sachs and others admittedly were insider
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.640]  trading on that buyout deal that's how they roll meanwhile they're all behind
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.040]  the toll roads that scheme hasn't died Mitch Daniels who now may be the vice
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.840]  president is part of that scheme as well then after super high I want you to
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.160]  break down Mitch Daniels Mike Adams is riding shotgun with us this is the
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.240]  governor Indiana just let's just look into a window of Bilderberg into just
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.000]  Mitch Daniels who they want they don't want Rand Paul that we've got that from
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.600]  sources that they don't they don't like his father they don't trust Rand Paul
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:24.160]  obviously because he's not a globalist but he's a little more political they
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:28.560]  are they do not like Rand Paul they like Mitch Daniels Rubio into the CFR and
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.600]  promised world government as well at the same time but but but go over the
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.440]  data sheet you wrote up last night from all public sources you got any
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.960]  Arizona article later today on this will go over this monster well in short Mitch
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:45.240]  Daniels ties into the George HW Bush power structure but even more than that
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.640]  is a quail front Dan quail the quail family basically owns Indiana each state
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.600]  has its own little mini cartels and Mitch Daniels worked with Eli Lilly he was
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.560]  head of the corporation that the quail family owns a controlling interest you
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.640]  wonder why they sold us on all these gaps about how stupid Dan quail was how
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.400]  he couldn't spell potato or how he thought a $4 job at Burger King was a
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.160]  sign of economic progress that's all to keep you from looking at the admitted
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.560]  ties like how the Queen's cute that's a standard psych warfare operation these
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.160]  are these are genius level vicious killer psychopaths okay I mean again they
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:25.080]  got it they got the aspartame approved they got the prozac approved and then
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:28.180]  he was the front man to cover up all the mass deaths and suicides keep
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.600]  breaking them and of course Eli Lilly is the top producer of thai Marisol that
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.840]  they put in vaccines and under the George W. Bush administration they tried
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:42.080]  to sneak in total dismissal of all thai Marisol based vaccine lawsuits under
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:47.720]  the Homeland Security Bill in 2002 but that's to protect us from 9-11 Alex but
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.120]  Mitch Daniels is a lifelong lobbyist through the Reagan administration through
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:56.560]  the Bush administration for Eli Lilly he headed the company in the late 80s
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.040]  early 90s before that he was president and CEO of the Hudson Institute on
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.640]  camera what it who is the Hudson Institute well they're basically the
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.480]  Rand Corporation it was founded just like the Rand Corporation by Herman
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.280]  Khan and his buddies they call it a conservative think tank I don't see what
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.360]  the scientific military industrial think tank business has anything to do with
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.560]  the idea of conservatism this is a scientific takeover of the economy and
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.440]  that's why they get even more globalism under Republicans anybody that
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.120]  thinks Mitt Romney's gonna save him has a hole in their head and again I'm not
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.240]  even attacking Mitt Romney himself or Obama these they are non consequential
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.440]  there will be no difference but in rhetoric folks this is a scientific
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.480]  blueprint takeover in their own words tell me about how he was the head of the
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:49.760]  highest sub group that directs Rand yeah that is the Hudson Institute today it's
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.360]  headed by Henry Kravitz his wife Marie Jose Kravitz they meet annually at
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.960]  Bilderberg but it used to be Mitch Daniels they're absolutely part of the
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.120]  top power structure they're a lot more secretive than these other groups and
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:06.800]  they really steer the way this whole system is going and you can see how it
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.720]  interlocks with Eli Lilly immediately after leaving the CIA George Herbert
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.680]  Walker Bush went to the Eli Lilly Corporation on the board of directors
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.800]  put there by the quail family there's tall roads run through it all I mean it's
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.080]  just insane and it's every one of these guys once you start looking at them
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.800]  they're connected to all the other groups and what's the number one thing
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:31.280]  just pushing poison on the public fluoride in the water GMO McDonald's it's
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.560]  all been a plan I'm suspicious of Scientology as well but that whole
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:40.600]  demonization of Scientology came about from quail and bush and Mitch Daniels in
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.120]  the early 90s when they almost stop Prozac killed its market share and we're
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.480]  about to have it removed instead they released hit piece after hit piece in
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.120]  all the major papers to make them look crazy maybe they are that's up to you
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.480]  to decide they didn't like them attacking Eli Lilly's Prozac Mitch Daniels in
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.120]  particular bare minimum the Scientologists are a competitor group
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:05.680]  with the globalist they they want to that that's the argument that they will
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.000]  they want to be them well I'm not even getting into site so I don't know but
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.480]  they were hurting the pros and Mitch Daniels was a specialist at defending
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:18.560]  the the role of Prozac in the public's mind and it drove market shares right
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.240]  back up spiked up there as they continued to put thy marisol in the
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.480]  vaccines it tried to get themselves immunity on it Mitch Daniels is an
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:30.360]  angel of death just like many of the others but headline but he was part of
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:35.000]  the Indiana toll roads again centra and mackery with their thumbprints all over
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.200]  and they take over now they're gonna get moped pack a paid for road older at the
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.560]  lane that you get and turn it into a toll road even though that's illegal
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.800]  bushine executive order saying they could be as an executive order over through
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.560]  law and it's just total criminal takeover they get these conglomerates do
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.640]  these fake choices it could all be toll road only part what do you want and again
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.000]  while they block all the other roads being built and steal all the money they
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.440]  have a surplus in Texas it's total criminality no it's the masters of the
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.480]  false left-right paradigm it's not just Obama and Romney it's coke and Pepsi
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.280]  meat at Bilderberg it's one writer at Bilderberg says let's use diplomacy in
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:18.080]  Syria the other writer says let's bomb them right now today let's starve them
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.680]  young Fareed Zarkaria exactly I mean these people are unbelievable they're
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.960]  masters of controlling a fake paradigm a false reality it's like going you know
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.200]  going to Disney World it's its own city it's its own town it's fake oh yeah this
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:37.280]  and again look up Disney World Pentagon laboratory you'll find out the whole
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.480]  things a Pentagon laboratory for Fallujah you're like Fallujah how to lock a
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.440]  city down how to have biometrics and you're paying to be part of a laboratory
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.400]  I mean these people are the more you read into this the more you see that the CIA
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.840]  just bleeds over into the Rand Corporation bleeds over into Bilderberg
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.440]  these people admit Google's NSA created as I told you decade I mean this all
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.720]  here yeah and they have huge conglomerates to suck out the profits
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.280]  while they make the public pay for infrastructure Mitch Daniels again not
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.800]  only did the toll road he put a new there's really not just the government
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.560]  there's this corporate private state where they're now transferring its power
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.160]  over to it completely calling it privatization that's why they're
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.800]  flirting with libertarians because it's a fake libertarian system oh but
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.560]  privatization Mitch Daniels put a new tax on the people of Indiana so they
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.720]  could build sports stadiums the Lucas Oil Stadium the Indiana Convention Center
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.560]  which again is a psych warfare center tax and also use to put them in the camp
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.280]  yeah it was a tax on liquor though so it sounds like he's doing something good
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.320]  but the point is he's a continuation of quail and bush I didn't even get to get
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.640]  into how they rigged the FDA so they could approve biotech sell vaccines
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.400]  unapproved but I know that is already in most people's brains it's in hundreds
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.600]  of foods they're put

[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:36.680]  in there 7 a.m. I hear him start yelling and I went out and saw some of the TV
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.640]  myself the mayor of London saying you Americans you shouldn't even have this
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:46.480]  be able to celebrate this like a weekend you made a big mistake in 1776
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:50.800]  oh queen is so incredible that's a big news item right there and the army is
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:54.680]  like oh yes we're so sorry and it's just everywhere and at the little hotel where
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:59.320]  people are watching it down there at breakfast going oh queen queen I mean
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:04.600]  this is not even a Brett not even a German it's Transylvania royalty it's
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:08.640]  mainstream media their total globalist criminals they live off the dole Prince
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:13.280]  Phillips and Nazi and they've got people you know that guy on CNN
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.440]  incredible she's eating soup right now look at her she stood up and waved the
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:24.440]  honor the courage I mean you describe it better than I this is total
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:29.360]  twilight zone not just for England I mean in the last 800 years they hate the
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.040]  royalty on majority but here the Americans really believe it's like
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.040]  Snow White in the seven dwarfs no she's the big bad witch folks we only have a
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.920]  few minutes Jacobson but but describe what you've been witnessing for people
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.480]  that are out there because it's it's I mean they're all witnessing it as well
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:49.040]  I mean this is just insane all right thanks Alex yeah I woke up early this
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:52.520]  morning as I usually do on these trips and I went downstairs and of course the
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:56.880]  TV's playing like you know right in the middle of the dining area and the first
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.560]  thing I see is CBS morning today their morning show it's not their cable show
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.920]  but it's the regular broadcast show and they have the mayor of London on and
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.520]  they're like we're going you know here we are with the mayor of London and they're
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.720]  showing scenes of London of everybody cheering the Queen and everybody and then
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.800]  they come to your imitations it's funny oh yeah they cut to the mayor and he's
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:23.600]  like you people the biggest mistake you Americans made was back in 1776 and the
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:32.280]  CBS crew was like you are so correct oh if only we were able to not make that
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:37.040]  mistake and the worship just continued from there I mean I was disgusted
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.200]  have articles in the Philadelphia newspaper like the Constitution is the
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.280]  declaration bad British experts say perhaps we don't have a right to revolt
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:48.560]  declaration of independence bad yeah we are I was sitting there in the middle of
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.600]  that room I'm like where the hell you know where am I and the biggest mistake
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:59.000]  that we have made was 1776 because we don't get to bow down and worship this
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.520]  lady you don't get to properly enjoy but it goes on and on I mean David page of
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:07.720]  notes I got a couple of pages here like David Cameron they do an interview with
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:12.880]  him and he won't talk about actual issues Syria the economy no no no he will
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:18.560]  only focus in on the Queen oh the Queen oh they she's not officially part of
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.480]  government but she's there for all the decisions and they strongly take her
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:26.880]  recommendations at every level runs the whole thing she has governor just
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.640]  nicks the whole deal whenever she wants all the Commonwealth continue I couldn't
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:35.680]  even believe it I was listening to then our our press CBS is like oh and the
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.160]  British do it so much better than us oh my god even though they have rings of
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.560]  security just like us there's so much more civilized you actually walk up to
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.160]  10 Downing Street and knock on the door guys I've been there guys with machine
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.000]  guns and banned citizens out on the main road from any free speech we have it on
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.520]  video no free speech in certain zones just like in Australia they arrest you
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.960]  yeah and the freedom the Queen gives us and how civilized you knock on the door
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:06.680]  and somebody answers and it happens to be David Cameron it's all just a giant
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.440]  sigh of that like as if they weren't expecting her like people are our
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.440]  military what to do keep going yeah I mean just like I mean you reminded me
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.960]  this morning like it's a very similar to a North Korean situation where they're
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.360]  all phony crying it's all these people are
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:28.720]  queen make you go out and worship the you know the Kim Jong-un son or you
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.520]  get arrested oh it's exactly the same and then they cut back to the studio and
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:39.480]  it's like the Queen should be praised for standing up she was standing there in
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:44.680]  front of her people like they're her pets you know oh her people that I she's
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.080]  identifying with her people and my question again you're not allowed to
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.680]  have British or UK patriotism they even say don't have the King George flag it's
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:56.920]  it's evil but you're only allowed to have patriotism when it's worshiping
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.560]  your foreign murdering monarch yeah I mean this woman has nothing to do with
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.360]  us in this country as far as I knew but now it's like all the points at your
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:09.720]  other all right so I mean the jellyfish media of course they went on to praise
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.920]  the rain oh it rained for the Queen and actually the rain was actually a
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.240]  character so I went on to do a little bit of research just to see what kind of
[01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:22.120]  damages is doing for the Brits and it looked turned out that they closed the
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.760]  bank and called it a banker holiday so this thing besides all of the rest of
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:30.120]  it is costing the Brits one point two billion dollars in debt for closing the
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:35.320]  banks for one day and all those Brits are cheering and screaming yeah it's just
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.520]  the idiots they have come out and doing it so sad they think that's all that's
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.400]  left of England that's the only time they're allowed to cheer is for their
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.280]  foreign pig monarch all right folks Warren Bilderberg coming up Mike Adams

[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.240]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.320]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.200]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:24.360]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:32.960]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:36.640]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.080]  future that will be but one that might be this is not a new world it is simply
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:18.520]  an extension of what began in the old one it is patterned itself after every
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.360]  dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:28.240]  history since the beginning of time it has refinements technological advances
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:33.720]  and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom but like
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:39.480]  every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule logic
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.360]  is an enemy and truth is a menace
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:34:01.120]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.360]  all right welcome back folks to the Alex Jones show on this Monday June 4th
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.600]  2012 you just heard some powerful segments with Alex Jones Aaron Dykes
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:16.480]  Rob Jacobson Jacobson all on the road right now returning from Chantilly
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.200]  Virginia wow a lot of hard-hitting breaking news coming out of there you
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:24.400]  know the important thing to realize is and by the way we're gonna be Jim Mars
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:27.840]  is gonna be joining us here in just a second but the important thing to realize
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:33.400]  in all this is that this is not fiction this is not conspiracy theory the
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:38.360]  meeting took place the world leaders are there they are the global mafia they
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.680]  control the banks they control the technology they control the search
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:47.200]  engines they control the economy they control all the rules and regulations and
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:52.320]  laws and even the non-laws that they use that they invoke to try to control us I
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.440]  mean they control the food they control the drugs the pesticides the chemical
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.600]  companies petroleum energy everything you name it and they have an agenda which
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.920]  is to reduce human population down to maybe one billion people or so maybe
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.240]  more that's the only part that's debated is how how many of us do they want gone
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:15.720]  not whether they do or not so so here to join us with some thoughts on all of
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:20.800]  this is author researcher investigative journalist Jim Mars he's the author of
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.400]  many books including the trillion dollar conspiracy it's all about zombie banks
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:29.680]  and much more he joins us by phone today with his analysis of what has just
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:34.040]  happened in Virginia and what it means for our future as people trying to
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:39.840]  survive on planet Earth Jim welcome to show today hey Mike thank you so much
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:46.200]  for having me it's good to have you on man it's it's really amazing it's part
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:51.600]  of crime the epiphany for me because of course I've been talking about the
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:56.760]  builder burgers for many years now and particularly in my book rule by secrecy
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:03.520]  which was published in 2000 of course written in the 90s and back then when I
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.280]  tried to tell people about builder burgers like what what's that what yeah
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:11.400]  and then you try to talk to the media and they're always nothing they're not
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:14.720]  there don't don't look at that don't look behind the green curtain you know
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.400]  and today I mean I think the reason that they had to meet in Chantilly
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:25.360]  Virginia is because last year when they met in Switzerland the European media
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:29.880]  was all over including even some Swiss politicians who showed up on that
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:33.200]  saying hey what are you guys doing in there you know they kind of pulling an
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:38.280]  Alex Jones yeah and and and this year they decided well let's get back to
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:45.560]  America where we can keep a plate close tight rain on the media and of course
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:51.200]  that doesn't include Alex he's gonna go where he wants to go which is great
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:56.400]  that's that's what the the the milk toast lamb balls who called himself
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:00.360]  journalist today that's what they should be doing they should be pounding down
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.560]  the door saying what you folks doing in there yeah well you think about this if
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.680]  there was any meeting of any other group of professionals you know a hundred
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:14.680]  baseball players a hundred actors a hundred scientists from NASA it would be
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:18.840]  covered by the media but for some reason go ballistic I mean just think about it
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.680]  Mike what if what if all the owners of the National Football League franchise
[01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:27.360]  this man hotel underarm guard for a week and then came out wouldn't tell anybody
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.960]  what they talked about oh man they'd be screaming restraint of trade you know and
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:40.440]  and just all kinds of stuff they just go nuts you know this is a monopoly you
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:45.200]  know y'all are this is terrible but but here's here you got the people who are
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.160]  actually trying to run the world and they get a pass yeah yeah but also the
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.400]  thing about this gym too in not covering this and in denying it the
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:00.400]  mainstream dinosaur media has only further discredited itself because now
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.920]  every reasonable rational person that's observing these events can say wait a
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.040]  minute this really happened you know info wars has all the footage all the
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.880]  real-time transmissions and broadcast everything this really happened these
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.440]  people are there the photographs of these world leaders supposed leaders scum
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:22.480]  that that we like to call them here at info wars leaving the event it's the
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:27.840]  event is real it really took place and the media says it's not real they won't
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.640]  cover it how more discredited could they get well I I saw recently we're seeing
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.720]  in his loss like almost 50% of its listeners and this is why because they
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:44.440]  are nothing more than just propaganda organ for the corporate state and people
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:48.280]  are beginning to realize that then this is this is what the good news is Mike this
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:52.720]  is really good news I mean we're talking about it more people are waking up and
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:58.000]  there are a lot more of us than there are them and this is why they reduce the
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.880]  world's population but if the world's population even 10 or 20% of us got
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.240]  wide awake realize what the game plan was and simply put our foot down and
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.160]  said no we're not gonna go with this then they're out of business right yes
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:16.720]  yeah and and I'm glad you pointed out that's the silver lining in all of this
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.960]  you know Alex is great at at uncovering the truth of what's going on and
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:26.040]  showing the threat at the same time the flip side of what he's doing and what
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.200]  the entire crew here is doing and what people like you and I do and others like
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.880]  us is we also show the power the power of the individual the power of telling
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.200]  the truth the power of speaking out the power of just showing up I mean you know
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.840]  80% of the battle just showing up right look look at what Alex did with the
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:47.920]  bullhorn he didn't have a firearm on him he wasn't armed but he he made history
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.240]  with a bullhorn and just the will to just confront the nonsense and assert
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:57.040]  his constitutional rights right there on the scene think about the power that we
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.960]  have as a nation if more people would just be like Alex yep well you know it's
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:07.400]  like the old children's story about the the emperor's new clothes all it took
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.600]  was one little boy to say hey different got a clothes on and everybody went oh
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.480]  holy crap that's right the emperor doesn't know it have any clothes on and
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.880]  that's that's what that's what we're doing today yeah not ranting or even not
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.680]  trying to change everything just simply saying look you know look what's going
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:30.080]  on today it's not right it's ridiculous and you know we need to all wake up and
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.640]  but it's kind of happening it really is a good example I was just seeing a thing
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:39.240]  here I know I drive a little Prius it's a hybrid okay and I'm getting pretty
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:45.400]  pretty good mileage getting 46 miles the gallon something like that and you know
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:52.520]  that's good but I've seen a thing today where the Volkswagen and other companies
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:59.800]  they're making a car with an engine that'll get in excess of 70 miles to the
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:05.600]  gallon oh wow that's great so how come we can't get one because they won't allow
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:11.320]  them to be sold in the United States sure okay now wait a minute wow what's
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:17.360]  this all about scarcely man nation which seems likely is that yes it's corporate
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.560]  greed but it's more than that I know here in Texas we we have one of the best
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.720]  highway systems in the nation and it's due to the gasoline tax when you buy
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.160]  gallon gasoline for two dollars and fifty cents or I mean three dollars and
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:36.960]  fifty cents however much it is now probably more than half maybe three
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.160]  quarters of that price you're paying for that gallon gasoline is taxed and those
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.400]  taxes go to build a highway and maintain the highway well if everybody start
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:52.240]  driving 70 mile an hour a 70 mile per gallon cars then that's going to cut
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.520]  their taxes and then we'll have money repair the road so they say well it's
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:01.040]  an economic issue well so what do you do about that okay it's real simple if you
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:05.400]  educate people and people understand that they could have a car that could get
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:10.360]  70 miles a gallon and cut their gasoline bills in half if they truly
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:15.320]  understood that then all they got to do is for a significant percentage of people
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.840]  just say okay I'm not going to buy a new car this year until you give me one
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.520]  that give me 70 miles a gallon and what the car manufacturers can do they're
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:28.160]  going to choke up and say okay here's a car that'll get 70 miles an hour this is
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:36.680]  how in a in a market a free market and even in a corporate run market that's
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:41.120]  how you can get something done because they are greedy and they do look to their
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.560]  bottom line and if you can affect their bottom line they will change yeah but
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.560]  the issue we've got in America today is the government interference the with
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.720]  the free market obviously the crony capitalism there's no free market right
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.200]  there's no free market and speaking of the automobile industry we've got the US
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:02.440]  government now actually spending taxpayer money to move US automobile
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:07.320]  manufacturing facilities overseas into places like China actually gutting the
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:11.800]  industrial base gutting the jobs base in America here and doing it deliberately
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.080]  and saying that the government is here to save you the whole time because now
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:18.560]  you don't have a job you don't have a house you don't have health care now
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:22.040]  you're a total government dependent a total victim and that's right where they
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:28.040]  want you that's the game plan Mike if you will know you know it is it is
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:33.200]  absolutely incredible but what they want is everyone totally dependent on the
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:39.320]  government and that's why they are pushing this globalist socialist agenda
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.360]  people go on socialism oh no but you know people have different views of
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.880]  socialism and that's just like people have different views of democracy and
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.880]  socialism you know which means public ownership of all the means of
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:55.120]  production distribution that doesn't sound like such a bad thing really
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.440]  doesn't mean that's what everybody loses sight of also on any social program
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:06.040]  whether it's good better and different it's gonna require central administration
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:10.880]  yeah right and that's the key to it because once they get a global socialist
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:16.240]  system and some programs like say Medicare or Social Security might be good
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:22.400]  some programs like Obamacare are probably terrible but regardless of whether
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.400]  good better and different they require central authority and these globalists
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.240]  these people who meet at Bilderberg they know they have the power and the money
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:35.600]  to buy up the central administration and then that's how they achieve one of the
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:41.040]  oldest goals in the history of the world which is control of the world no it's
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.000]  it's incredible clearly clearly a global world government is on the agenda and
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.840]  another agenda agenda 21 of course is world government control of all all
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.560]  environment land animals resources things like that but let me let me ask you a
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:58.360]  financial question Jim that's been on my mind here there's so much happening in
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:04.280]  Europe right now a financial cascading collapse appears to be imminent we've
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:09.200]  got the Greece situation we've got Spain on you know money fleeing Spain some
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:14.240]  bank runs have already been reported there a lot of concern about Spain we've
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:19.400]  got the Tokyo market just crashed on Friday to a 28 year low there's new
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:22.760]  talk about the new retirement age for many people in many countries around
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:26.160]  the world is going to have to be set at 80 years old so you can't retire until
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:30.040]  your 80 if you even live that long which is highly unlikely likely if you're
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:32.880]  injected with the cancer-causing vaccines and drink in the fluoride in the
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:38.760]  public water supply your thoughts Jim Mars well that's pretty much it they're
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:44.960]  working their global agenda but you know there's so many aspects to this for
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.360]  example everybody kind of knows about the federal reserve system and how it's
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:53.320]  neither federal nor does it have any reserves and it's simply a collection of
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:56.600]  banks that are owned by other banks which are then owned by private individuals
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.400]  many of whom are not even American citizens and these are the folks who are
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.440]  looting us and looting the public treasury let's not forget the $15
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:09.800]  trillion that Ben Bernanke said overseas to prop up foreign banks right now when
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.600]  people are struggling to make a living struggling to keep their families afloat
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:18.480]  by groceries and then you tell them that their tax money is going to prop up
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.880]  foreign banks that should get people upset but they don't really hear it
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:27.440]  because they listen to TV okay but they've got all kinds of things going on
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:32.160]  the financial stability board are you familiar with that this is something
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:40.560]  that Barack Obama signed us up to in 2009 on April the 2nd 2009 at the G20
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:45.920]  meeting in London he signed us up for the Financial Stability Board which is a
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:52.360]  used to be called the Financial Stability Forum which was a division a
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:56.760]  part of the Bank for International Settlements which if you've read my
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:01.360]  book The Rise of the Fourth Reich you realize was an old Nazi controlled bank
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:08.000]  before during and after the war and they had the Financial Stability Forum
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.360]  which was basically just a good old boys meeting of the international bankers
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:18.440]  trying to keep things stabilized and everything in their favor well now they
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:24.720]  changed the name to the Financial Stability Board and we have signed up
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:31.040]  for this and according to their own it's a policymaking board and they can set
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.600]  standards policies regulations and pass them on to their respective nations and
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:41.360]  the idea is to standardize the financial system in the world right right
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:46.400]  global global bank own financial system anymore it's in the hands of a board
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:52.040]  made up of foreigners that just came out of a Nazi controlled bank yeah but but
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.320]  look where it's going Jim and and Darren McBreen here at the Info Wars Studios
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:59.600]  has been doing some research and reports on this it's all about going to a
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:04.400]  cashless society it's all about the right the chip implants the electronic
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:08.080]  centrally globally controlled money system where everything you buy is
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:12.840]  tracked every financial transaction is spied on by the government just by
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:17.160]  default immediately you have no financial privacy you can't even carry
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:21.240]  cash without being considered a criminal and that has already begun in some
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.760]  ways it's in embryonic stages but it has already begun but now here's the whole
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:31.400]  thing Mike how are you going to get people in the world particularly like in
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:37.040]  North America and the United States where we had a had a pretty stable and
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.880]  widely accepted dollar how do you get them to go to such a system you have to
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:46.600]  destroy the dollar exactly and they're doing it quite well yeah but let's talk
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:51.880]  about that the dollar right now is looking good but only relative to the
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.440]  collapse in Europe so a lot of money is fleeing Europe into the dollar making the
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.680]  dollar look good your comments go ahead yeah that's like saying my dilapidated
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:03.600]  rundown old house looks pretty good compared to the one next door which is
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:11.400]  burning down fire right everybody run to the shack yeah exactly no that's
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:14.840]  exactly what's going on also the other important point here is that all of
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:18.040]  these so-called defenders people who work for the government the TSA workers
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:22.600]  the this the police the FBI all of these people who work for the government
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:26.000]  they are dependent on government pensions for their retirements that's
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.320]  right now we're we're headed into a break here shortly but I want your
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.960]  thoughts to you and what what's gonna happen when these pensions disappear
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:37.960]  well here's the big problem is that and this happened years ago this happened
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:43.240]  back in the 70s because I saw the story before I left the newspaper I was
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:49.200]  working for at the time and that is that they crossed the threshold the 50%
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:54.480]  mark where now more than 50% now it's way on up there of the population of
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.800]  the United States a big healthy majority of the population is now
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:05.120]  deriving its sole income from the government okay and when you have that
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.600]  kind of situation then you have the very situation that the Turquoiseville wrote
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:15.200]  about when he came over and saw the fledgling United States just beginning
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:20.080]  in back 1700 went back and wrote and said that you know democracy sounds good
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:25.040]  but it'll never last because as soon as people realize they can vote themselves
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:29.960]  largesse from the public treasury they're just gonna vote for ever promises
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:34.160]  of the most sure and unfortunately that's kind of where we are today I think
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.600]  we've crossed that threshold already Jim we got to go to a break here so
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.920]  hold on just a second but when we come back from this break I want to ask Jim
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:47.160]  Mars about the zombie apocalypse that has been happening across America his
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:50.880]  comments on that a much more when we return here on the Alex Jones show stay

[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:32.120]  know the quote from Alex that he said earlier says he says quote we're not
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:36.600]  heroes we're just trying to survive and that's why he hates to be called a
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.480]  hero for anything that he's doing out there even though people see you know
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:43.400]  you have a lot of courage you're very aggressive out there fighting for
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.760]  freedoms and so on but he doesn't want to be seen in that way he says we're
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.520]  just trying to survive and he wants you to join the fight in working to survive
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.920]  and of course one of the authors who has been working in the same parallel
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:58.680]  effort for a couple decades several decades in fact is Jim Mars and he
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:03.400]  continues with us by phone here on the Alex Jones show so Jim before the break
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:08.600]  we talked about the zombie apocalypse we've got literal zombies rising up
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:15.640]  across America now several reports including the face-eating zombie in Miami
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:19.960]  which I guess is not a laughing matter breaking news this morning what the one
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:24.600]  cannibal which we're calling zombies was captured in Berlin as of this morning
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.600]  that was reported on the drudge report so what are your thoughts Jim what's
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:33.240]  going on right before we get to the zombies let me toss in one coat of
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:37.520]  here on what we were talking about before the break about how that there are
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.920]  now more people making their living from the government than paying into it you
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:49.000]  know one thing just one simple change of law could could really make a huge
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:56.080]  effect here and that is that anyone who is driving more than 50% of their income
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:00.160]  from the government should not be allowed to vote okay because it's a
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.180]  conflict of interest sure only those who are paying into the government get to
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:09.360]  vote because otherwise the whole thing lopsided and it doesn't work well
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:13.480]  unfortunately we've crossed the 50% threshold though Jim so now more than
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:16.600]  half the country is on the dole and they're never that's that's never gonna
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.520]  happen I agree with your assessment but it's never gonna happen and now they
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:22.560]  vote and they're not gonna vote for somebody who would try to take their
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.520]  vote away so I know it's a catch-22 but you can see how ridiculous the whole
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:30.920]  thing is and that's leading kind of to what we're talking about here about the
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:36.360]  zombies first let me tell you where the zombie thing came from or at least for
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.240]  my book the tree dollar conspiracy which I was forced to change the title by the
[01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:46.280]  publisher my original title was the zombie nation yeah I like that title
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:51.200]  better everyone does and in fact I'm convinced that the only reason they made
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.440]  me change it was to diminish the sales they really don't want it out
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:02.520]  in fact sure enough they stuck it over on the financial bookshelves in the
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.400]  bookshelves you know where only only a few of the number of countries go to
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:14.960]  actually get those books and investment people but anyway the thing is if that
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:20.040]  started with what they called a zombie bank now a zombie bank is a bank that
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:24.720]  is broke okay it's dead but it's still going through the motions it's still in
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.800]  business because of the tarp money you know public money that's been tax money
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:34.000]  that's been thrown at it to prop it back up so it's dead but it's going through
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.560]  the motion so they call those zombie banks well the reason I call it zombie
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:43.400]  nation is because depending on who you want to listen to this nation now owes
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:51.280]  somewhere 15 trillion 20 trillion plus trillions of dollars which is an
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:58.000]  unimaginable number and yet it's also been estimated that if every man woman
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.840]  and child in the country sold off everything they've got their clothes
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:05.320]  their TV their car their house everything we couldn't come up
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:10.560]  collectively with maybe but about nine or ten trillion dollars so in other words
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:14.640]  we're broke we're a dead nation yeah we're just still going through the motion
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.920]  domination hey we got to go to break again real quick short break here folks

[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:44.520]  from Kurt Nemo Paul Joseph Watson and others we continue now with our
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:48.840]  conversation with Jim Mars author and investigative researcher we're talking
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:54.720]  about zombie banks and now we're going to get into human zombies or degenerative
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:58.520]  human zombies because there seems to be this rise of the zombie apocalypse in
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:03.400]  America that I don't know what's behind it but it is there are several cases now
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:08.640]  of people losing their minds and then feasting on others other humans and the
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:12.880]  CDC has even warned us about a zombie apocalypse and they're gonna they're
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.240]  gonna have a handle on it this is this is true I'm not making this up it's an
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:20.680]  official page on the CDC's website US government's website warning us about a
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:25.280]  zombie apocalypse so Jim Mars continuing what are you what are your
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:31.480]  thoughts on the the the human zombie situation that we're seeing well I went
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.080]  looked at the CDC website sure enough they got a whole thing there on zombie
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:40.840]  apocalypse but it was tongue-in-cheek and it was done I think to bring people in
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:47.920]  to learn how to store food water and how to prepare themselves for a some sort of
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:53.080]  disaster so that was just their little PR move yeah it is interesting though
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:58.800]  and it what it brings to me Mike is the question the age-old question of does
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:05.480]  art imitate life or life imitate art you know I mean I'm pushing it on up
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:10.520]  there I've lived quite a number of years now and I don't recall stories of zombie
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:17.280]  attacks or cannibalistic attacks crazy people running around this country until
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:24.200]  after the zombie metaphor became a pretty standard in science fiction horror
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:29.960]  movies novels and TV and everything else so it really does make you wonder you
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:35.600]  know or are we are we actually thinking in terms of zombies because somehow the
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:39.920]  subconscious level we realized that we kind of are zombies we're just getting
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:45.960]  up going to work come home watch TV go bed get up go work come home watch TV you
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:50.480]  know are we really have we kind of been turned into zombies that we kind of
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:55.120]  subconsciously well I'll have to say is that explain our fascination with clearly
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:59.240]  clearly well those are people that I call functional zombies Jim they're
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:03.520]  functional zombies they can still go to work and punch a clock they can still
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:07.720]  you know watch the news they can still line up and get their vaccine shot and
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:11.480]  so on but yeah there's zombies they're sleepwalking through life and I got to
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:17.480]  think that some of this has to be just the incredible cumulative burden of all
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.240]  the chemicals from the vaccines from the fluoride the aspartame the food
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:26.640]  additives over-the-counter medications pesticides and all of that and then some
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.520]  people just cross that threshold and sometimes perhaps a street drug causes
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:34.400]  them to do that they blame this this latest person on so-called bath salts
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.120]  which is just just a sort of a street name for a designer drug but you know
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.520]  what got me was early on they were trying to say that bad thoughts of some
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:49.120]  sort of LSD it's not you know that I don't know what bad thoughts it's
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.640]  supposed to be I don't I don't know either it's some some kind of designer
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:57.640]  synthetically created molecule that but but some people thought they were
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:01.480]  actually bath salts and they are now afraid to buy bath salts and put them
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:04.320]  in their bath because they think they're gonna turn into zombies that's not the
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:12.120]  case folks yeah yeah don't melt them down inject them into your veins that's
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:17.560]  probably a pretty good principle for anything yeah including vaccines yeah
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:20.800]  yeah well yeah think about if you inject a peanut butter into your veins you
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:23.760]  might go crazy too so what are they gonna do declare war on peanut butter
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:29.280]  next you know this is pretty typical though of our society's reaction we all
[02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:35.080]  try to blame a drug we try to blame guns we try to blame any kind of you know
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:44.320]  non-organic thing or drugs or whatever we I know 20 seconds Jim do what we're
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:50.760]  running out of time man I gotta thank you yeah well said Jim Mars thanks for

[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:46.640]  yours truly and so I put together a new one called seven reasons to reelect
[02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:51.960]  Obama yep and we're gonna play that in in a few minutes and what you didn't know
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:55.560]  you didn't know I was an Obama supporter I'm a huge Obama supporter are you
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:09:01.040]  kidding me in fact I came up with seven good reasons to reelect Obama and I
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:07.880]  just felt so just emotionally driven by that that I wanted to share it with all
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:12.920]  of the Alex Jones listeners I'm sure Alex won't mind you know let's vote for
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:16.160]  Obama come on seven reasons anyway that's coming up in just a few minutes

[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:24.800]  who keep contacting me over through natural news and you want me to get
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.080]  something to Alex that doesn't work okay I never see Alex because the only time
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:35.280]  I'm here is when he's not here think about it I I never see Alex I mean I
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:40.240]  talked to him on the phone occasionally but I can't get stuff to Alex really so
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:45.960]  that doesn't work you have to send it to info wars studios anyway here's a here's
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:49.160]  a note that I wrote down that was an important discussion point about
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:52.960]  something earlier remember the Ted Turner video that you saw in the previous
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:59.080]  hour and was that we are change that recorded that yeah we are change a great
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:02.920]  confrontation with Ted Turner where he admitted right there on camera that he
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:07.480]  wanted to reduce the world population to I think he said a two billion level and
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:12.880]  he wanted a one-child policy for the next hundred years and then Alex talked
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:16.920]  about the depopulation agenda the important note that we did not get to
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:23.080]  discuss at that time is that the depopulation agenda is has already it's
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:28.160]  it's it's nearly complete a lot of you are out there thinking well let's just
[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:31.680]  stop that when it happens you know we'll say no when it happens you're
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.800]  already infected with SV 40 if you have been taking vaccines all right your
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:41.160]  fertility is already compromised if you've been eating GMOs you're already
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:45.720]  contaminated with the artificial chemical sweeteners with the synthetic
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:51.120]  chemical pesticides in fact new research from a professor right out of the
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:55.720]  University of Austin University of Texas at Austin that we covered over at
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:11:00.360]  natural news talked about the quote transgenerational epigenetic inheritance
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:05.160]  which has been proven in laboratory tests what does that mean big big phrase
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:10.560]  what does it mean it means that if if you are exposed to chemicals today that
[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:15.120]  your offspring three or four generations down the road can suffer the same
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:20.080]  damage the same neurological damage of that exposure even if they are never
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:25.400]  exposed to it so it means that everybody getting vaccinated now that their
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:29.920]  family tree is about to be history another two or three generations down
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:33.760]  the road they may be completely infertile and doesn't that fit just
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:40.520]  perfectly into Ted Turner's agenda hey why why commit mass murder of the
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:44.360]  population when you can just have them all voluntarily line up to get
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.280]  vaccinated and make themselves infertile you know that's the difference
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.040]  between what's happening today and what happened let's say in Nazi Germany in
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:57.320]  Nazi Germany they the Nazis had to line up the Jews at gunpoint it was
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:01.880]  obviously involuntary for the prisoners to go into the gas chambers and be
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:06.440]  killed that's not something you would want to do voluntarily obviously but
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:11.240]  today the eugenics is being carried out with the support of the people they
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:16.720]  line up to be injected at the pharmacies they just line up they beg for the
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:21.360]  chemicals they beg for the drugs they beg for the chemotherapy treat my cancer
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:25.880]  doctor and destroy my kidney and liver and brain at the same time but people
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:30.320]  don't know that last part of it so that's the big difference is the soft
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:35.600]  kill it is already upon us don't think that you're gonna have time to defend
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:39.040]  against this if you aren't already standing up and speaking out and sharing
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:43.880]  this information with people you're late you're behind the curve and it's
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.040]  it's it has already begun that's the important message here that's what Alex
[02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:52.200]  is trying to urge you all to to understand to really grasp that we're
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:56.960]  late okay we have a good shot at restoring liberty restoring our
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:02.440]  republic and and and defeating these globalists eugenicists but if you're
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:06.160]  not already in the game you need to get off your butt get off the couch turn off
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.520]  the the cable news and start making copies of Info Wars videos and start
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:16.880]  sharing this broadcast with everybody you know and get them on board with the
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:20.480]  truth of what's happening that's that's why I'm here that's what I'm into is
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:23.920]  just sharing all of this information just trying to report the truth it's
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:27.800]  like Alex said we're not heroes we're just trying to survive okay trying to
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:32.600]  survive now 30 seconds here we're gonna be rolling this video right that's our
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:36.320]  timing all right now let me give a little intro to it this is seven reasons
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:41.800]  to reelect Obama yeah great reasons you'll want to share these with everyone
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:46.160]  so we're gonna roll that video go to break and then we'll come back with some
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:48.920]  more discussion about some other things and then an interview with James Jaeger
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:53.400]  from tactical response is coming up at the bottom of the hour but enjoy this
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:14:20.920]  video showing reasons to reelect Obama have a look
[02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:40.360]  at all of your own food now the compassionate government can take the
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:59.400]  extra food and redistribute the food to those in need don't call it communism it's just mandatory charity who says government doesn't have a heart number 2 vaccine mandates poor vaccines are good for everyone so with individuals
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:26.400]  decide they don't want vaccines that puts all of us at risk when the great Obama is reelected he will use executive orders to authorize armed government vaccine enforcers to make sure that every man woman child and even unborn children are vaccinated at gunpoint is necessary because it's all for your own good it's about government protecting you from you
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:52.400]  number 3 gun control here in the Obama administration we really like gun control because it means that we control the guns not you Obama's goal is to remove all the guns from American citizens and place them in the hands of trusted honorable federal government workers like the TSA who are keeping America safe from terrorists that might be hiding in your underpants
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:16:17.400]  sure our attorney general Eric Holder sold tens of thousands of guns and grenades to the Mexican drug gangs but he was only trying to enhance America's economy by boosting exports arming criminal gangs in Mexico is okay you see but allowing law abiding American citizens to buy guns that's bad that's why Eric Holder wins our big brother brainwashing award congratulations
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:22.400]  just really brainwash people with the thinking about guns in a vastly different way
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:48.400]  number 4 secret arrest on December 31st 2011 our savior Obama signed into law the national defense authorization act which legalizes secret arrest detention interrogation and torture of American citizens on US soil with no due process or bill of rights because who has time for all that anyway and if you don't have anything to hide you shouldn't mind being interrogated in the first place
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:17:05.400]  due process only protects criminals like those people who criticize the government they should be arrested and if you help reelect Obama we'll make sure that the bill of rights never gets in the way of giving out free camping experiences courtesy of FEMA
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:27.400]  number 5 criminalizing farmers under the Obama administration our government promoted food safety by raiding fresh milk farmers and food distribution centers at gunpoint see that's where guns are really good so after King Obama is reelected we intend to expand this effort to criminalize backyard chickens
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:42.400]  small livestock operations home gardens and any food source that isn't owned by one of the politically connected mega corporations that gives us campaign contributions remember if your food doesn't come from a factory it's probably illegal
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:18:03.400]  number 6 GMOs our illustrious leader Obama is so supportive of jellyfish modified foods that we lovingly call him GMO Obama I know working hand in hand with Monsanto and the science based biotechnology industry Obama plans to outlaw all heirloom sea
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:23.400]  then introduce new GMO craps engineered by our favorite technology super hero Mr. Bill Gates you love the new fruit fruit shot corn on the top VP tomatoes contain core exit monkey berries that we feed to the TSA and our new favorite brownie fried chicken
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:41.400]  a white house delicacy and finally number 7 reeducation camp day our savior Obama believes in education for America not just one education but a second education reeducation remember reeducation is free education
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:59.400]  just like we promised our campaign speeches so that's why we are now activating reeducation camps all across America it's also kind of like free camping for everybody because at these complimentary camps which are surrounded with razor wire for your security and comfort
[02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:12.400]  citizens who do not understand Obamaism can be taught the principles of compassionate government do a series of lovingly delivered group beatings that we call social therapy
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:29.400]  yay so much fun to watch that I just I love that part remember it takes a village to reeducate some people and there you have it the top seven reason to re-elect Obama with your help we can transform America into a whole new Obama nation
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:47.400]  imagine a world with free education free camping no more guns in the hands of citizens free energy enhanced food for everyone and in the supply of loving vaccine specifically formulated with mercury to enhance your intelligence so you can take like we do
[02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:50.400]  so vote for Obama in 2012
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:20:00.400]  take 41

[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:35.400]  yeah there's a little bit more to it there's an outtake at the end it's kind of funny we're gonna have this posted on YouTube and natural news shortly and send it over to the info wars team that and that video actually does plug info wars at the end also it says it says stop
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:51.400]  electing tyrants vote no mama in 2012 so it's not a it's not a it's not a pro Romney video it's not pro anyone it just says that look at the track record of Obama this is obviously not the guy that we want running our government for the next
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:25:07.400]  four years I mean as if we need more grenades sent to the Mexican drug gangs I'm not sure how that's supposed to help anything I got a couple other interesting items here I mean I know it's been a whirlwind of news today so just to take a quick breather from that
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:24.400]  and show you some other interesting stuff Alex requested me to bring this in this is a similac go and grow soy based formula for babies and if you let me let me turn this here so we can get it just right
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:41.400]  oh here we go the in the ingredients we're showing on on the prison planet TV check it out this is the famous ingredient list right here 42.6% corn syrup solids alright that's it from formula for you 42.6% corn syrup solids
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:26:01.400]  followed by 14.7% soy protein isolate followed by some safflower oil and then another 10% sugar that's on top of the 42.6% and then another 8.4% soy oil and probably genetically modified because most soy is genetically modified so if you look at the first five
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:20.400]  ingredients of infant formula sold in America today four out of the five ingredients are sugars and soy I mean come on come on is it any wonder why we have a problem with children having learning disabilities or being diagnosed with the
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:34.400]  false disease of ADHD or ADD is it any wonder why obesity is a problem why sugar addiction is a problem this is real folks this is not a made up label this is this is right here the similac infant formula
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:50.400]  yeah there's the the front cover oh look it's got a cute little fuzzy teddy bear on the front right here look at that oh the cuddly teddy bear says it must be good for you and it says right here soy based formula balance nutrition for older babies nine to 24 months with iron
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:27:05.400]  oh they put some iron filings in there or something great have a little iron with your soy and your sugar it'll make you magnetic they give you like a magnetic soy based personality hey you could be a trendy you could actually be your
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:19.400]  own trendy and start your own videos of why we should change our light bulbs or something like that I'm sorry folks I I cannot sit in this chair without having a little bit of comic relief at some point throughout the show it's just so intense
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:35.400]  alright here's something else Japan diet glasses fool wearers into eating less these are augmented reality glasses that that scan the scene and then they augment that they have a display in them so they they place a new image
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:51.400]  an apparent object on the scene that you're looking at and what the way this works is when you're eating a cookie or a muffin these augmented glasses make the cookie appear larger so that you eat 10% less because your brain thinks you're eating a larger cookie
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:28:06.400]  and I just got to thinking wow the US government could do this with like social security checks make you think you're getting a larger check or they could even make prison food look good with this there's all kinds of things that they could do with augmented reality glasses
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:23.400]  like for example you could be watching the news and they could make you think it's real oh wait a minute they already do that it's called CNN Charlie Rose and everybody else Charlie Rose of course recently at the Bilderberg meeting I wonder if he will actually even mention
[02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:38.400]  the Bilderberg on his own show that would be a question but if you think about what's going on in the world today so much of it is just is just out of control and we've got this augmented reality technology coming in and Google is heavily invested in that and I think that's a game changer and not necessarily in a good way
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:57.400]  but if you think that TVs can program you today you wait until people are wearing glasses it's like wearing the internet on your face and at that point they're going to be able to feed in advertisements and feed in messages and you can bet the government's going to have a mandatory circuit for real time government emergency announcements
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:14.400]  which are going to be things like oh emergency there's a terrorist in your neighborhood who's been caught carrying cash and that family over there hasn't taken their vaccine shots if you see them call 911 so we can dispatch vaccine enforcement team people
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:30.400]  vaccine enforcers yay that's the voice from the animation you just saw yes Darren's Darren's voice was a weird concoction from my studio in any case straight ahead we're getting back into some serious topics with none other than James Jaeger the founder of tactical

[02:34:53.400 --> 02:35:08.400]  well I see me in the YouTube videos yeah well it's just you know I started shooting when I was young and started competing I started working undercover as a police officer and continue taking training and more and more and more and I started a little training
[02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:24.400]  school and I continue to train you know to this day I take home several several hundred hours of training last couple years and it's just a few farms is the only true American martial art I view it as a martial art I follow it with that level of discipline
[02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:36.400]  well that's a really good point and by the way I see for those watching on prisonplan.tv they have shown your bad dude photo up is like you look you look so I mean truly you're actually a nice guy in person you don't I mean you look very intimidating in this picture though but
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:51.400]  which one is it I'm sorry that's the one you've got the black shirt with showing your tattoos you got an AK that is that is in the belly of the Death Star that is in the parking garage of the NRA Center of the Perfection Academy
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:36:06.400]  oh that's funny that's funny and why an AK there for that picture that's my trusty AK you know I have you know a truck gun and what's better than an AK-47
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:12.400]  right on I see you got your finger trigger safety you're practicing what you teach there that's good
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:27.400]  so a bunch of questions for you James because the audience of course here is very much into the Second Amendment and having the right for self-defense but one of the problems that I see today is a lot of people are buying firearms and they're sticking them on the shelf and that concerns me does it concern you
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:47.400]  absolutely and just you know just Cooper said buying a guitar doesn't make you a musician buying a gun doesn't make you safer and but the good news is Mike there's an overwhelming number of people going out and getting firearms training that doesn't match the amount of people that are buying them but still there are more people coming to train and that is a good thing
[02:36:47.400 --> 02:37:05.400]  what kind of trend are you seeing then for example is your student roster just jam packed this year compared to let's say two years ago what's what's the story 2008-2009-2010 25% growth each year 2011 50% growth and we're looking at another 25% this year
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:22.400]  wow wow so you've more than doubled in just just a few years that's incredible and I noticed that the class I took from you you know you weren't teaching you have instructors that they're teaching how many instructors do you have that are fanning out across the nation to teach people competency and firearms
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  I've got a small cadre of full-time guys there's four of us full-time and then I've got a huge adjunct number of guys that come in to help from time to time on different different schools and classes and stuff like that so I've got about 20 guys all together and last year that was enough to train 3,110 people
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:46.400]  wow that's how many rounds of ammo were fired through all of that a few million rounds
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:38:05.400]  yeah probably close to 3 million probably incredible speaking of millions of rounds by the way there's something I want to ask you a lot of people are concerned when they saw the Department of Homeland Security buying up a contract they awarded for 450 million rounds of hollow point 40 caliber mostly pistol ammo of course
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:19.400]  plus on top of that lots of contracts for 223 and a lot of other things I noticed in your class when I was in your class a lot of guys were talking about that is that do you hear a lot of people just chatting about that they're concerned about those kinds of things today what do you hear
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:31.400]  absolutely concerned about that you know we have all these economic processes that they can hear them from either side there are people there are mutterings of martial law and that's what that ammo might be for
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:41.400]  so there's a lot of skepticism and there's a lot of people that have concerns just they come to class all the time
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:56.400]  yeah well but at the same time I think it's important to point out that your school trains a lot of law enforcement a lot of undercover cops in fact I've got a history of volunteering and being involved with law enforcement in Arizona and helping those guys out there
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:04.400]  but the law enforcement that I see in your classes are guys who are also you know with the program they're like we're not giving up our guns and they're the cops
[02:39:04.400 --> 02:39:21.400]  absolutely not and you know I believe that I have to bring a foreign military in to snatch our guns away from us but to by and large the people that show up in our classes are patriotic American citizens and they believe that the Second Amendment does not give us the right to keep our arms
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:35.400]  that God does and the Second Amendment recognizes that right you're exactly right no I'm I'm I'm really glad you pointed that out because the Bill of Rights all it does is is codifies the natural God given rights that we are born with
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:47.400]  yeah just just just defines them and outlines them and puts them in a spotlight that's all but of course the global agenda is more about well they'd like people to be more disarmed because it's so much easier to you know corral them
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:40:04.400]  yeah exactly like look at look at JPFO just as a classic example Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership JPFO you know they realize that if if the Jewish victims of the Holocaust had firearms they could have perhaps defeated Hitler and avoided the loss of I don't know how many million lives
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:18.400]  right absolutely let's talk about gun myths for a minute because a lot of people approach firearms they have a lot of mythology surrounding it for example people like to use cars for shelter when they're getting shot at tell us about why that doesn't work
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:35.400]  well it doesn't work because cars don't stop bullets effectively if you fired if you walk down beside a car you fired 10 handgun rounds through it 6 or 7 are probably going to get through it as you walk down inside of that car and the thing is is that I'm not a very lucky person I don't buy lottery tickets
[02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:41.400]  and so depending on what to protect me by getting behind the cars gonna probably not one of my last choices
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:56.400]  yeah you'd rather rely on skills and training it sounds like right and and and good equipment as well absolutely you know that if I can catch up there might be a hierarchy of survival principles four items mindset is at the top
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:03.400]  and tactics and skills and then gears at the bottom you have to have good gear but it's the least important aspect to your survival
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:11.400]  absolutely and by the way for those who want to read your blog I believe that is getoffthex.com is that the correct URL
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:16.400]  yeah getoffthex.com I've got a Facebook page upon YouTube I mean it's pretty easy to find us
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:21.400]  all right all right just search for James Yeager and the spelling of his last name is Y-E-A-G-E-R correct
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:22.400]  yeah just like Jack
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:34.400]  okay right on right on and then the the main training website is tacticalresponse.com and you know there are a lot of great training schools out there as well do you have any others that you would also recommend as just being good quality schools
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:45.400]  the list the list goes on yeah like I said I continue to take training Clint Smith out at Thunder Ranch Clint and Heidi Smith run a great school out there in Oregon Thunder Ranch I was out there and took a high angle rifle class last year
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:42:00.400]  Craig Douglas known as South Narc on the internet does some extremely good stuff I mean this is like a Renaissance period for firearms and tactical training there are a lot of guys doing a lot of really good stuff Larry Vickers
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:06.400]  I consider to be a friend he does some really good classes for my Delta Force guy there's just a bunch of great stuff going on
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:12.400]  yeah also also more and more women I'm seeing in the classes as well all right have you noticed that also
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:21.400]  yeah absolutely we went from having about zero percent women to now classes are about about the fifteen or twenty percent women
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:28.400]  wow that's incredible it's awesome to see some of them are really very quite accurate and very skilled as well
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:37.400]  what's funny is it used to be the women we saw were dragged there by their husband more and more now we're seeing husbands dragged there by their wives
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:46.400]  yeah that's great the other thing I really love about your information is because you do so much training because you see so many rounds fired down range
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:55.400]  you also get to look at what equipment works and what equipment doesn't work and I want to ask you for example what handguns don't fall apart at the range
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.400]  because I've seen people bring stuff it just breaks after a couple hundred rounds
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:07.400]  listen there's a lot of great stuff a lot a lot of good guns being built blocks that I'm a block guy that you know that's just the way it goes
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:16.400]  Smith and Wilson M&P finally there's an American made gun that I can depend my life on so the M&P line is even in rifles it's fantastic
[02:43:16.400 --> 02:43:26.400]  SIG makes great pistols I really like those I mean there's you know Ruger of course another American made company Ruger guns are typically a little heavier and stuff like that
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:36.400]  but of course they actually work so there's a lot of really good guns if you kind of pin me down to handguns I'm going to say Glock or Smith and Wilson
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:44.400]  yeah you're the reason why I went to Glock 19 actually and doing very well with that with the big dot sight on it too
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:54.400]  what about the 1911's I know it's highly debatable these guys love their 1911's they bring them to class and they jam up or whatever
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:44:04.400]  are you okay to talk about your take on 1911's absolutely I got a lot of hate over this basically John Moses Browning was a genius
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:13.400]  absolute genius and there's not a handgun designed today that doesn't have some kind of DNA from one of Browning's designs so I want to just start out with
[02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:22.400]  I pay homage to John Moses Browning however the 1911 was designed during a time when craftsmen hand fitted guns together
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:31.400]  and it is a gun that simply does not lend itself well to modern machining practices CNC, EDM, MIM and things like that for instance
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:39.400]  quote unquote drop in parts and so we have a gun that was supposed to be built by craftsmen now being built on a mass production scale
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:49.400]  and things like stacking tolerances you engineers know I'm talking about these things just begin to add up and they just don't work well
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:53.400]  and what does that translate into jams or malfunctions what?
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:58.400]  yeah well they don't call them jams they say oh that wasn't a malfunction that was a failure to feed or that was a failure to eject
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:05.400]  but anytime the gun you press the trigger and the gun's got bullets in it it doesn't work there's no problem
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:11.400]  now there are some guys that can build guns John Jardine out in California built a gun you can depend your life on
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:21.400]  you know Wilson Combat my buddies over at Wilson they can build a 1911 that runs Jim Garth Wade up Pennsylvania that guy can build 1911s that work
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:26.400]  they're all craftsmen they can still do it but there are very few of them
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:31.400]  yeah yeah good point but so then in terms of mass manufacturing the Glock's of course are legendary the M&P now
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:35.400]  what's the story about the mushy trigger reset on that on the M&P is that solved yet?
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:38.400]  but that is much to do about nothing
[02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:41.400]  really I haven't fired one of those so I haven't felt it
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:49.400]  well you know people say to me I can shoot for instance they'll say I can shoot a SIG really good but man when I shoot a Glock I'm all over the place
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:57.400]  and I think that's silly and if we if we change the brand on that you would too if I say to you I can drive a Dodge straight down the road
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:03.400]  but you put me behind a Ford I'm running off in a bitch I'm hitting metal boxes this doesn't make any sense besides the trigger
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:09.400]  you know gas pedal steering wheel you know either you can shoot or you can't
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:19.400]  right right let's talk about okay America is unique in the world in that such a high percentage of its population is trained in firearms
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:29.400]  is competent in firearms would you agree that that helps protect America from possible foreign invaders or foreign agendas
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:32.400]  I mean America is going to be a tough country to try to overrun
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:38.400]  absolutely I mean even if you go back to World War two you know the Japanese wouldn't even consider
[02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:43.400]  coming onto our shores because they said there was a rifle behind every blade of grass
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:50.400]  and certainly that's a problem I don't know what the numbers are now but I heard that over 50,000 AR-15s alone
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:58.400]  were going into civilian hands every month five years ago five years ago no production has increased what's it 100,000 a month
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:02.400]  yeah that's just AR-15s
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:09.400]  yeah that's incredible doesn't count all the pistols but but it's also it's also regional so you've got obviously a lot of firearms
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:18.400]  competency in Texas in Tennessee in North Carolina in you know the southern belt in Florida even as well Arizona many places
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:25.400]  but then you've got these pockets of like Massachusetts for example where they have all these crazy laws about guns
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:29.400]  so that population is going to be very easy to invade it would seem like
[02:47:29.400 --> 02:47:33.400]  well here's what's funny I've got a lot of friends at the NRA
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:38.400]  the NRA was started on Long Island New York after the Civil War to keep the marksmanship skills in northern troops up
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:47.400]  in case those pesky ripples acted up and so that the irony is that there is any kind of other rebellious activity
[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:51.400]  that's probably going to be a majority of NLA members that are doing it
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:56.400]  and so and I think that is that's geographically independent
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:03.400]  I have shooters I just taught a class in West Virginia we have some guys from Maine there we have some guys from Connecticut there
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:10.400]  they were shooters and now can their neighbors shoot I don't know but I live in Tennessee and not everybody here can shoot either
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:15.400]  but the guys that are serious about it I think it doesn't really depend on where they live I mean I've got some of my top shooters
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:21.400]  are Canadian and New Yorkers really yeah that there are absolute tacticians absolute shooters
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:28.400]  Wow that's that's interesting what about the collapse scenarios that people talk about a lot of people are living in the cities
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:35.400]  they're afraid of let's say a riot a collapse of social order or an economic collapse
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:40.400]  they're worried about how they can survive a city or get out of a city with a bug out bag and a firearm
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:45.400]  how you know how they can safely get their family out is that is that something you hear a lot of people talking about
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:50.400]  all the time I get couples in class all the time I'm going to say you know hey why are you guys here
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:55.400]  and they'll begin to say something about we heard had you had your reputation blah blah blah and I go no no no
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:49:01.400]  why are you taking any class and they say well and they kind of like kind of like they're embarrassed to say
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:06.400]  but you know we've got a little extra food at our house and we've got you know some medical supplies at our house
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:11.400]  and we bought these guns just in case something happens we don't know how to use them
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:19.400]  and so these conversations happen in every single class and it's people coming to the classes that think they're the weirdos
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:25.400]  because their family makes fun of them their friends make fun of them for preparing and then they get around us
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:29.400]  and we go oh yeah we all do that and so they feel at home
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:36.400]  Yeah exactly well the other thing though too is Americans I know you've worked outside the country
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:45.400]  I mean you've served outside the country Americans are they tend to vastly underestimate the depths of human intention
[02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:52.400]  when there's a war when there's bad things going on in society you know you know how low some people can go
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:56.400]  if they're desperate and starving and vicious right I mean
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:01.400]  absolutely I just want to just to make sure everybody's clear you said served I've never been in the military
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:06.400]  I'm sorry yeah I just want to make sure everybody you know everybody understands
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:14.400]  but yeah social decay is a very wicked thing and you know even if we look at even if we look at Katrina
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:18.400]  some of the things that were happening down there some of the things that were happening in the Houston ashram
[02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:22.400]  I for one do not want to be dependent on FEMA to protect me and my family
[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:26.400]  yeah and and so these are these are real legitimate concerns
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:31.400]  well then that's the other side of this too is that there's it on the left side of the political spectrum
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:36.400]  they try to paint gun owners as being just crazy violent people in fact the opposite is true
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:41.400]  they're the ones that want to restore peace and non-violence to social situations
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:45.400]  if we were as crazy as they said we were they wouldn't exist anymore
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:50.400]  yeah hey we're gonna go to break James stay with us we'll be right back after this break with much more
[02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:52.400]  here on the Alice Jones show
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:26.400]  one of our oldest sponsors their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:32.400]  when you need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes
[02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:38.400]  and produces electricity from the sun it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:44.400]  whether it's ice storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:50.400]  when the power goes out this winter you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solutions from science

[02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:18.400]  oh
[02:54:18.400 --> 02:54:25.400]  in our final segment here joined by James Yeager the founder of tactical response they are a firearms training
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:31.400]  school just a very large school offering training in many different states across the United States
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:38.400]  and you know the thing is there's a lot of bickering in the industry there's a lot of competitive competitiveness
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:41.400]  and aggressiveness among different schools who offer different types of training
[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:47.400]  but look I've learned something in every class that I've ever taken on firearms and I learned a lot
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:51.400]  from taking the tactical response firearms class here in Austin not too long ago
[02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:57.400]  so James what you know isn't it funny that people like to argue about little fine details
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:01.400]  meanwhile most of the population just needs some basic training right
[02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:06.400]  right yeah I kind of I'm kind of one of the few instructors that actually tells people
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:11.400]  hey go to these other places you know and because I think if you're walking that true martial arts path
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:16.400]  you've got to do that but yeah it's more relevant that they get some training
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:21.400]  and what training they actually get you know I mean even even the most basic array of pistol class
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:28.400]  well you know have you becoming a safe and responsible shooter yeah well the thing that you taught me the most
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:34.400]  of your your class is to move just move because most guys stand there in front of a paper target
[02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:38.400]  and just shoot off rounds and then reload standing still they do everything standing still they clear jam
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:43.400]  standing still they're just a target waiting to get shot well you probably heard this in class
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:49.400]  but it's more important to not be shot than it is to shoot the bad guy right and another little acronym
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:56.400]  we use for the word move this motionless operators ventilate easily nice good acronym there
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:01.400]  yeah one of your instructors actually had a cattle prod that he was going to start using on us and we didn't start moving
[02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:07.400]  very effective the other thing that I learned from your class and others is you know there's a myth that if you
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:12.400]  shoot somebody once that that's over they just fall and die like they do on on TV and Hollywood movies
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:17.400]  why why is that not true James well I mean there's a difference but first off there's a difference
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:23.400]  difference between locality and incapacitation people say things like well more people kill 22s than anything else
[02:56:23.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  so they carry 22 the problem is you can deliver that lethal lead to a guy he's bleeding to death
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:34.400]  he'll be he'll bleed to death in 11 minutes but he is stabbing you to death while he is bleeding to death
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:41.400]  and so we get to you know have a balance of locality now all handguns suck I don't care
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:49.400]  what caliber it is it is terrible fight stopper so you you know 9 or 45 of the calipers I recommend
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:54.400]  and put them where they where they belong house in her chest the right the brain box yeah exactly
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:59.400]  there's a big debate about you know nine millimeter strong enough or powerful enough to be effective
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:05.400]  itself defense and as you teach of course it is if you put it where it needs to go I sure you it will
[02:57:05.400 --> 02:57:12.400]  kill people yeah and end of sentence enough said right there but again I want you know the context
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:17.400]  of this interview for everybody listening and watching is about restoring order to your community
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:22.400]  protecting your household protecting your family protecting your neighborhood if things go wrong out
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:27.400]  there law enforcement is going to be spread so thin that they may be completely incapacitated I
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:33.400]  mean I'm sure you hear that from cops in your class let's just look at history look the LA riots
[02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  the shopkeepers that stood up for themselves didn't get their shots burned out right ones that didn't
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:44.400]  have have you know any protection that the shops are down it's just as simple well yeah and again
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:49.400]  this is about having the skills to be part of the solution so you may be working with local
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:53.400]  sheriffs they may deputize you and say help protect us from this gang of looters that's
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:57.400]  burning down houses things like that right yeah absolutely could happen especially in the south
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:04.400]  they'll deputize anybody just show show some competency and you know how operate with ethics
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:10.400]  folks that's the thing operate with ethics and and you know defend the innocent protect law
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:16.400]  and your rights well James sorry to cut you off there we're about out of time but I want to thank
