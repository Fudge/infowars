[00:00.000 --> 00:07.480]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.480 --> 00:15.520]  GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:15.520 --> 00:35.280]  Well, we have a very special broadcast lined up for you today. Pentagon survivor April Gallup
[00:35.280 --> 00:40.640]  will be joining us in the fourth hour today from 2 to 3 o'clock Central Standard Time,
[00:40.640 --> 00:49.880]  3 to 4 p.m. Eastern. We have Bob Chapman coming up and joining us in the third hour of the
[00:49.880 --> 00:56.440]  International Forecaster to spend an hour with us and break down what appears to be the beginning
[00:56.440 --> 01:02.800]  of what is being called the greater depression. Financial forecasters, economists are calling
[01:02.800 --> 01:11.000]  this the greater depression because of the numbers we're dealing with and the lack of
[01:11.000 --> 01:17.200]  sophistication of the average American investor, the fact that we are in urban settings and not
[01:17.200 --> 01:23.320]  in rural so that when things collapse, it will be complete and total bedlam when the credit
[01:23.320 --> 01:28.440]  card stopped working, when the welfare checks stopped coming. And that's by design. All of
[01:28.440 --> 01:32.040]  this is by design. We have the documents. We have the proof. We have the facts. We'll be going
[01:32.040 --> 01:41.080]  over that today. And yes, David Ike will be on the show in T minus one hour. I may even get him
[01:41.080 --> 01:48.040]  on a little bit earlier, but he's coming on for one hour today. David Ike is a icon in the
[01:48.040 --> 01:51.880]  awakening movement, the truth movement, whatever you want to call it, love him, hate him. He cannot
[01:51.880 --> 01:58.080]  be ignored. And we always enjoy a visit with him. So he'll be joining us for one hour to talk about
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.360]  his view on the financial collapse, which he's been predicting for over a decade, knowing that
[02:02.360 --> 02:06.640]  the ruling elite through the banking system have openly said they're planning to do this.
[02:06.640 --> 02:13.000]  Just like Napoleon, when Napoleon fell, what the Rothschilds did in 1815. And I'll be talking
[02:13.000 --> 02:22.000]  about that today. So big show, David Ike, April Gallup, and of course, Bob Chapman. And that's
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.960]  some surprise guests we're working on today, tomorrow, maybe next week, some really big
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.160]  guests lined up for the show in the next few weeks, that's guaranteed. We like to surprise you
[02:31.160 --> 02:35.880]  with big guests, kind of like we're surprising everybody with David Ike today, one of the more
[02:35.880 --> 02:47.360]  popular guests out there. Really serious news. Words cannot properly or in a ample way describe
[02:47.360 --> 02:51.800]  what we're dealing with here. And there's so many facets to all this. I'm going to get into the
[02:51.800 --> 02:59.720]  economy after the break. But later in the shower, brigade homeland tour starts October 1st in the
[02:59.720 --> 03:07.120]  US. And in this Army Times reports that it's it's chilling. They say they hope the army won't have
[03:07.120 --> 03:12.040]  to shoot Americans. They say they've been touring in Iraq and that now that'll be their job here.
[03:12.040 --> 03:19.840]  And in between microwave guns and less lethal weapons that they talk about. They say, well,
[03:19.840 --> 03:26.800]  the military regular army will be out helping the police and auto accidents. See, that's how
[03:26.800 --> 03:32.560]  they ease it in. It's like, oh, the army now helps for wrecks instead of a fire truck and a police
[03:32.560 --> 03:40.120]  car to the US armies here. And then, oh, they're just on the streets helping with car wrecks. So
[03:40.120 --> 03:46.240]  not a bang, but a whimper of the Republic dies. Just suddenly there's stormtroopers all around,
[03:46.240 --> 03:52.240]  battle hardened. They're rotating them out of Iraq. This brigade and it's the first of many.
[03:52.240 --> 04:01.480]  It's the third infantry. First BCT. An entire brigade. Now, and they start mentioning all the
[04:01.480 --> 04:11.480]  classified brigades that we covered in 1998, 1999, 2000, when we were freaking out on air going,
[04:11.480 --> 04:16.440]  my God, we've got the secret documents. We've got Marine Corps captains. We've got emergency
[04:16.440 --> 04:21.320]  managers. We've got police chiefs. There's a secret military takeover of the US happening.
[04:21.320 --> 04:26.200]  People said, oh, really? Where is it? Where are the FEMA camps? Where's the mass roundups? We said,
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.600]  no, no, it'll come after stage terror attacks and then economic collapse. We laid out exactly what
[04:31.600 --> 04:36.240]  they're doing. Why? Because they state what they're going to do. They don't even veil it anymore. So
[04:36.240 --> 04:43.040]  the United States is now being invaded by the US military. I told you, it's not Afghanistan or
[04:43.040 --> 04:50.280]  Iraq or even Iran that are the prize. It's the US. The United States is under invasion by its own
[04:50.280 --> 05:19.800]  military.
[05:19.800 --> 05:28.960]  After the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[05:28.960 --> 05:35.560]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[05:35.560 --> 05:38.320]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[05:38.320 --> 05:43.640]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of
[05:43.640 --> 05:50.160]  Trump's rise. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com. It's

[07:52.120 --> 08:17.840]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. More than a decade ago,
[08:17.840 --> 08:30.200]  I warned my listeners on there there was a covert wide reaching secret program to incrementally
[08:30.200 --> 08:38.920]  introduce the American people to military occupation, military form of law. And in my
[08:38.920 --> 08:48.080]  films, police state 2000, police state 2 the takeover, police state 3 total enslavement, 9-11
[08:48.080 --> 08:59.680]  the road to tyranny. We show you illegal secret military units without patches on their arms,
[08:59.680 --> 09:09.200]  assigned from Fort Hood and that was in the army in one case, the Marines, military in black
[09:09.200 --> 09:17.800]  uniforms, in gray uniforms, in plain clothes, running domestic operations, drilling to take
[09:17.800 --> 09:26.640]  over police stations, sheriff's departments, city halls, driving buses to pick up people on
[09:26.640 --> 09:37.360]  pickup list to be taken to camps, to be taken to airports, those that are to be killed are
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.520]  going to be flown out of the country. We made films about that before they said, oh yeah,
[09:42.520 --> 09:47.120]  we grab citizens off the street with rendition, we grab people off the streets of Europe and
[09:47.120 --> 09:54.720]  the US and just fly them out to Poland and Czechoslovakia and Azerbaijan and we torture
[09:54.720 --> 10:01.840]  them to death. And we told you long before it was in the news about torture that the
[10:01.840 --> 10:09.720]  government was training giant cadres of men to carry out torture. I mean, it's part of
[10:09.720 --> 10:19.040]  the mainline special forces training in the army and the Marines and that's all been declassified.
[10:19.040 --> 10:25.360]  There's no doubting or denying what's going on, the new upgraded forms of torture, attacking
[10:25.360 --> 10:30.920]  people's children in front of them, the most dark, vicious, evil, criminal actions you
[10:30.920 --> 10:42.320]  can imagine. And how did I discover this? We would have urban warfare drills from California
[10:42.320 --> 10:50.440]  to Maryland to Texas, Missouri, Florida, and I would get local newspapers mailed to be
[10:50.440 --> 10:54.400]  my listeners. I mean, even the Miami Herald and it would say a helicopter fired into
[10:54.400 --> 11:00.600]  a restaurant and it, you know, bullets went into the tables and this police chief threw
[11:00.600 --> 11:06.600]  them out in a helicopter crash killing secret forces. The police wouldn't say who they were
[11:06.600 --> 11:13.040]  in Houston and police chief says Delta Force tried to bribe him so I'd get in the car and
[11:13.040 --> 11:15.880]  drive down to San Antonio and the police chief would say, yeah, they just come in with big
[11:15.880 --> 11:21.960]  bags of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars and are buying off the whole city. And he's
[11:21.960 --> 11:25.960]  like, I was in the military, I was in army intelligence. This is some kind of black cop
[11:25.960 --> 11:33.480]  like they take over third world countries. And we go on the radio here in Austin and
[11:33.480 --> 11:40.160]  I guess it's 98 I've been syndicated and people would call and say, you're lying. And I'd
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.640]  say, well, here are all the news articles and I post them on info wars.com and I made
[11:44.640 --> 11:51.320]  films about where there's just a checkpoint set up on the side of I-35 with the army pulling
[11:51.320 --> 11:56.120]  cars over pulling buses over searching them with one bus for 11 hours. And then it's
[11:56.120 --> 12:02.320]  saying it's just a drill. Then the FBI pulls up and tries to run us off Mike Hansen, camera
[12:02.320 --> 12:10.560]  guy, did a great job. And the FBI gives them the wrong document and gives them a classified
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.040]  document that says this is restricted. It's up on info wars.com. It's in police state
[12:15.040 --> 12:23.120]  to the takeover. And it says in 77 counties, we basically are the police. We're in all
[12:23.120 --> 12:31.320]  the departments. This is a secret operation to help you fight crime. All forms of crime.
[12:31.320 --> 12:36.640]  Pretty illegal at the time. They've since said Possecom and Tottis is gone. And we were
[12:36.640 --> 12:40.480]  telling you, but see, you weren't ready to hear it. And the establishment wasn't ready
[12:40.480 --> 12:48.360]  to tell you about it yet because it's a creeping death. They had to first pay off and infiltrate
[12:48.360 --> 12:55.240]  or find out who they couldn't pay off or infiltrate. And by the way, if you didn't take Delta Force
[12:55.240 --> 12:59.360]  and CIA payoffs in your city or county, I mean, they're in small towns, big cities,
[12:59.360 --> 13:05.080]  it doesn't matter. They bring in former FBI, former DEA, former CIA, and they will put
[13:05.080 --> 13:10.680]  in millions of dollars just to elect a little sheriff in a small town. Normally you might
[13:10.680 --> 13:20.960]  see $20,000 spent on that race. They'll spend millions. For now, large percentage of your
[13:20.960 --> 13:29.760]  sheriffs and police chiefs are feds. Forget just buying them off. They now have got them
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.160]  in place. And then they said, oh, we're building emergency management command bunkers for Y2K
[13:33.160 --> 13:36.840]  and for terrorist threats like building seven in New York they put in. And when they've
[13:36.840 --> 13:40.800]  got here in Austin, Texas and even rural areas, every four or five county areas have
[13:40.800 --> 13:46.440]  an area fusing their police departments, their sheriff's departments, their fire departments.
[13:46.440 --> 13:50.920]  And in hundreds of cases, they'll just move the National Guard armory in or they'll move
[13:50.920 --> 13:57.920]  the police department into the National Guard in the same building with them. All together,
[13:57.920 --> 14:14.000]  all being compromised, all nesting. It isn't enough to spend more than $800 billion a year
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.440]  just on budget for the military. They report about a $500 billion off budget not counting
[14:19.440 --> 14:25.760]  other narcotics money that's $400 billion a year conservatively. It's not enough to
[14:25.760 --> 14:31.120]  lock he down the red light cameras. It's not enough to have the federally controlled big
[14:31.120 --> 14:35.120]  international corporations training our police and brainwashing them. It's not enough to
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.720]  have the foreign global corporations buying up our city infrastructures now. It's not
[14:40.720 --> 14:44.800]  enough that the defense contractors are putting in the face scanning cameras, no license plate
[14:44.800 --> 14:50.000]  scanning cameras and now putting in cameras all over the country that see through your
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.080]  clothes just like they have in the airports. That was in the news yesterday. I don't even
[14:54.080 --> 15:00.360]  get to it. They are absorbing everything 10% in the statistics that came out a year ago
[15:00.360 --> 15:05.760]  of the college grads or Homeland Security related. 10% of the country are going to be
[15:05.760 --> 15:13.320]  spooks and spies and cops. And this is it, a military armed camp with a bunch of parasites
[15:13.320 --> 15:19.320]  who are just going to tax and run our lives. Classic tyranny. You got the average American
[15:19.320 --> 15:25.120]  still so brainwashed they just see a uniform. They just fall down and start worshiping.
[15:25.120 --> 15:34.440]  I remember being in Belton, Texas. We got a tip off. They were going to do an urban warfare
[15:34.440 --> 15:39.760]  drill. We show up. The mayor gets up in front of the news and says terrorist have attacked
[15:39.760 --> 15:46.200]  simultaneously. A couple cars blow up in the parking lot. The town starts freaking out.
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.080]  People around there by the city hall think the terrorist have attacked and the police
[15:51.080 --> 15:54.720]  chiefs sitting there smiling with the military behind him and looking at FEMA and they're
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.960]  nodding at him and he's smiling like it's funny and he reads this whole script about
[15:58.960 --> 16:04.480]  how we were attacked by terrorists and then says, but it was just a drill. Then the next
[16:04.480 --> 16:11.240]  day the paper comes out with a headline terrorist attack Belton. It's in road to tyranny. And
[16:11.240 --> 16:15.880]  then at the bottom, it's you have to read the big article. It tells you it wasn't real.
[16:15.880 --> 16:21.040]  See that's a that's a reeducation camp. A mass that city was turned into a reeducation camp
[16:21.040 --> 16:28.560]  shocking you psychologically manipulating you. Just like they have drills with the police
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.440]  show up on an ounce, throw fake blood on children and say, we're the militia homeschoolers for
[16:33.440 --> 16:40.280]  gun gun ownership, but that's been in the associated press. Or in another case, we're
[16:40.280 --> 16:44.480]  a homeschoolers against public education. We're going to kill you and they put guns
[16:44.480 --> 16:52.000]  to children's heads and they universally crap themselves in hard core mind control operations.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.560]  I mean, that is hard core teachers have heart attacks. Teachers have gone to mental institutions.
[16:57.560 --> 17:02.320]  One in Minnesota case we had their lawyers on took the kids out came in the portable
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.160]  building. So we're going to kill you were terrorist, marks the teacher out in the woods,
[17:06.160 --> 17:19.920]  put her on her knees. She's cuckoo for cocoa puffs. Just gone. And it's in the news they
[17:19.920 --> 17:24.960]  soil themselves. Now just came out in MSNBC. What a few days ago that they went into a
[17:24.960 --> 17:29.640]  big school, terrorized everybody, didn't tell the teachers said they were going to kill
[17:29.640 --> 17:33.640]  them. And when the teacher said this is bad, they said, Hey, the federal grant says we're
[17:33.640 --> 17:38.440]  going to do it this way. We're going to do it again unannounced. And every week I see
[17:38.440 --> 17:45.880]  a case of where they'll even have eighth grade camp during public school that the school
[17:45.880 --> 17:49.360]  just introduced that year and said, Oh, we're taking the kids out to these college dorms
[17:49.360 --> 17:52.920]  by the lake. Then they had people in black mask come to the doors with guns and knives
[17:52.920 --> 17:57.240]  and say they're going to kill them. I mean, this is they are that they are passing boundaries.
[17:57.240 --> 18:02.880]  They are they are conditioning. I don't care what you say you freaks. Hey cops, this is
[18:02.880 --> 18:07.840]  all being done so the fascist can take over and steal all the pension funds. That includes
[18:07.840 --> 18:13.920]  yours too. You understand you're part of something very evil. Do not rationalize unannounced
[18:13.920 --> 18:18.960]  busting in and telling people you're going to kill them. Rest is terrorist. Just don't
[18:18.960 --> 18:26.800]  try it. You're sick freaks. Any of you that say that's okay. So this is the type of stuff
[18:26.800 --> 18:30.840]  that's going on. Imagine having men throw blood on fifth grade students and then tell
[18:30.840 --> 18:37.200]  them they're going to kill them fake blood, red syrup. These are bastards and then say
[18:37.200 --> 18:40.720]  that pro gun groups did it. See those kids for the rest of their lives will hate the
[18:40.720 --> 18:46.360]  second amendment. That's mind control. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to the financial
[18:46.360 --> 18:51.520]  news and it's incredible. But that's only the beginning. See, first they gear up covertly
[18:51.520 --> 18:55.480]  take over local police departments, covertly illegally get rid of posse commentators and
[18:55.480 --> 19:00.640]  they staged terror attacks. As I said on July 25th, 2001. And as I said in films years
[19:00.640 --> 19:07.240]  before that that they would stage terror attacks as the pretext to roll out the secret military
[19:07.240 --> 19:11.880]  takeover and make it public. And how are they going to have them step out? What did I say
[19:11.880 --> 19:18.360]  in police state 2000 in road assistance? Oh, the army's just helping. And they they say
[19:18.360 --> 19:23.360]  on the army times. Imagine all the armies showed up with the jaws of life to get the
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.720]  lady out of the car. The cops can't do that. You're not militarized enough for them. You're
[19:28.720 --> 19:36.920]  not federal enough. It's all about jurisdiction. You know, used to have a county over was in
[19:36.920 --> 19:40.760]  your county. It'd be a big deal. Now it's all the feds are here. See, oh, what's wrong
[19:40.760 --> 19:45.840]  with the army? There's just helping direct traffic. But it says in the article and engaging
[19:45.840 --> 19:50.480]  the American people, it says if we try to they're getting ready for insurrection. I wonder
[19:50.480 --> 19:55.400]  what they think you're going to be insurrecting about a day unlike any other in the long course
[19:55.400 --> 20:01.040]  of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America
[20:01.040 --> 20:07.040]  on September 11. Who is the enemy? Bin Laden. This is his M. O. We have to look to the Middle
[20:07.040 --> 20:12.080]  East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled enemies is the first 9 11 film to take a close
[20:12.080 --> 20:16.880]  look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US
[20:16.880 --> 20:21.680]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again, very much engaged in spying in and
[20:21.680 --> 20:27.920]  on the U. S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections
[20:27.920 --> 20:32.800]  to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[20:32.800 --> 20:37.200]  intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government and much, much more
[20:37.200 --> 20:43.040]  fabled enemies. Get the DVD at info wars.com or see it in super high quality along with
[20:43.040 --> 20:48.960]  hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv. Either you are with us or you are with the
[20:48.960 --> 20:56.000]  terrorists. Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.960]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events,
[21:00.960 --> 21:04.960]  it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[21:04.960 --> 21:09.440]  depositors can remove from their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small
[21:09.440 --> 21:13.360]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending
[21:13.360 --> 21:17.760]  will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank
[21:17.760 --> 21:22.640]  run followed by a depressed economy. A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other
[21:22.640 --> 21:27.520]  central banks to increase liquidity for depositors. However, an increase in money supply without
[21:27.520 --> 21:31.920]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and
[21:31.920 --> 21:37.120]  stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned
[21:37.120 --> 21:42.240]  into gold and silver. While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on
[21:42.240 --> 21:48.880]  its own has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[21:48.880 --> 21:57.920]  That's 1-800-686-2237. We live in a world of vanishing privacy. The added threat of invisible
[21:57.920 --> 22:02.160]  radio waves sending out personal information to anyone willing to receive them makes our

[22:07.600 --> 22:12.400]  secure. Thieves are able to read information stored on these tags to steal your identity.

[24:03.520 --> 24:08.960]  Witnessing a covert operation's military takeover of the United States
[24:08.960 --> 24:14.400]  with the express intention of criminally looting the economy and as a rearguard action
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.440]  by the internationalists so the American people cannot get control of our government again
[24:19.440 --> 24:23.840]  and try to prosecute the people that have carried out this economic collapse. Now,
[24:23.840 --> 24:29.360]  I want to be clear to the FBI. I want to be clear to the military. I want to be clear with police
[24:29.360 --> 24:37.040]  listening in the cities that we're on. Like San Diego, Kansas City, Austin, Texas, Niagara Falls,
[24:37.040 --> 24:43.360]  places like that. I want to be clear to you. Everything I'm saying is backed up in triplicate.
[24:43.360 --> 24:48.880]  It is not my opinion. Did I just now start saying there would be big stage terror attacks and they
[24:48.880 --> 24:53.040]  would basically get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and publicly get rid of Possecom
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.400]  and Tottis, which they'd already covertly gotten rid of? And did I say that then an economic collapse
[24:58.400 --> 25:05.040]  would come and that they needed the police state so that they could criminally transfer things?
[25:05.040 --> 25:12.240]  It's nothing more than bank robbers come in and aim guns at people and say get up against the wall,
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.880]  hands up. That's all Northcom is, up against the wall, hands up. And they're all these well-meaning
[25:18.880 --> 25:24.960]  guys with bass boats at home and power of pride stickers on their cars and they've just been
[25:24.960 --> 25:29.440]  completely twisted and most of them have been paid off in Iraq with illegal money that's been
[25:29.440 --> 25:36.160]  admitted, a private gets 30,000, sergeants get hundreds of thousands, colonels, some cases millions,
[25:36.160 --> 25:42.080]  normally hundreds of thousands, generals, it's been in the tens of millions. They pay off city
[25:42.080 --> 25:48.160]  mayors, county commissioners. I mean just cash payoffs, folks, bribery. And they just say just
[25:48.160 --> 25:54.240]  be our friends, work with special forces, work with the federal government. Folks, they did that
[25:54.240 --> 26:00.800]  in Iraq when they helped bring it under globalist control in 1979. They did that for years before
[26:00.800 --> 26:04.960]  with covert operations. They're going around with big satchels of money and diamonds and gold
[26:04.960 --> 26:11.760]  right now in Iran for the last six years. They are doing, they are running a covert government
[26:11.760 --> 26:16.240]  takedown operation. But what are they taking down? It isn't enough that they have the presidents
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.160]  and the most the governors and the heads of all the major committees in Congress.
[26:22.160 --> 26:29.840]  Why do they need microwave guns and suppression forces and martial law control grids? Which is all in
[26:32.160 --> 26:40.880]  the Army times today. But all put in flowery, oh well we're going to help deal with insurrection
[26:40.880 --> 26:47.920]  and riots and we're going to use regular Army to also help get people in car wrecks and this is
[26:47.920 --> 26:52.480]  only one of many brigades to come and oh by the way it's linking up with the other brigades
[26:53.680 --> 26:59.120]  which had all been secret. That's why we, we, we go to Belton and they're blowing up cars
[26:59.120 --> 27:03.680]  in the public's freaking out running a Psyop just like throwing fake blood on kids unannounced and
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.920]  putting guns in their heads. And then I'd have Army walk right up to me and say you're the ones
[27:07.920 --> 27:13.440]  that videotaped me last year or a couple years ago in Belton when they were out on I-35
[27:13.440 --> 27:20.320]  South of Belton and he's like turn that camera off and I said no I've got a right to do that
[27:20.320 --> 27:25.120]  and he just looks at me with a murderous look on his face and then there's other military
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.600]  walking around with their name tags off but it says special forces, special operations.
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.320]  They're not playing games that was before 9-11 that was in 2000
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.560]  and see it always sounds reasonable oh it's ordnance disposal but then you find out but
[27:40.560 --> 27:46.080]  that's only the front we got their documents where it said in any law enforcement capacity
[27:46.080 --> 27:52.240]  we will deliver you helicopter, military and plane clothes. We want to assist you
[27:52.800 --> 27:57.760]  meanwhile their mayors and people are paid off. I mean you understand this is a covert
[27:57.760 --> 28:04.960]  operation completely illegal completely criminal with the stated aim of overthrowing the
[28:04.960 --> 28:12.240]  civil authority and notice that's why for 20 years mayors police chiefs call us civilians
[28:12.240 --> 28:15.760]  it's now military martial law nomenclature.
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.840]  I mean I remember this Marine captain who didn't know that Austin computer company he'd gotten
[28:23.840 --> 28:32.800]  out of it but he was a Marine in the 80s leading teams of Marines they would they were directed
[28:32.800 --> 28:38.080]  and he'd been part of space command guarding that guarding stuff out in Colorado Springs
[28:38.080 --> 28:43.120]  and then they send him out to Virginia and say we want you to head up a special project
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.040]  we're going to have you and other Marines dressed up in what looks like police outfits you know
[28:47.040 --> 28:53.200]  with just this police on the back in the blade in the windbreakers and you're going to be
[28:53.200 --> 29:05.040]  rating gun owners homes in gun raids. Now see that's as far as we can tell this this covert
[29:05.040 --> 29:12.640]  operation went into gear it was already set up by Eisenhower but it went into gear in 1984
[29:12.640 --> 29:16.800]  with Rex 84 and I meant to get into the economy I'm going to get into it right now it's just
[29:16.800 --> 29:25.040]  we're gay homeland tour starts October 1st 3rd infantry trains for new dewell time mission
[29:25.600 --> 29:29.120]  helping people at home may become a permanent part of the active army
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.600]  ah it says uh they'll be doing the same mission they had in Iraq that is suppression of the people
[29:37.600 --> 29:49.600]  and eugenics operations we're on the march the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[33:42.400 --> 33:47.040]  against the military being on the streets to help the car wrecks are you see that's why they put them
[33:47.040 --> 33:51.840]  in new york put them at the super bowl kentucky derby yeah you're searching your bags that you
[33:51.840 --> 33:56.640]  acclimate it to the military putting their hands on you you know they're they're trying to kill
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.280]  people and break things and any country that has their military on the streets is a third world
[34:01.280 --> 34:08.880]  police state like mexico or Guatemala or communist china or east germany under the stasi but well
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.240]  this land of the free home of the brave where we spy on you without warrants but our borders are
[34:14.240 --> 34:21.360]  wide open illegal aliens are above the law brigade homeland tour starts october 1st third
[34:21.360 --> 34:28.880]  infantry's new time mission helping people at home oh helping people at home and then they
[34:28.880 --> 34:32.720]  mentioned how they're going to help you with a baton upside the head may become a permanent
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.600]  part of the act of arming and why they've been gearing up for this all this year is because
[34:37.600 --> 34:44.000]  america is going by by land of the free home of the brave a land of milk and honey your pension
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.200]  fund as they've announced is going by by and the young marines are going to gun your ass down in
[34:49.200 --> 34:57.040]  the street or are they well that's why they're hiring aggravated felons for the marines in the
[34:57.040 --> 35:01.360]  army that's why they're hiring criminals in the sheriff's departments that's why they're hiring
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.240]  illegal aliens that's why they're bringing in mercenaries that are paid 180 thousand dollars a
[35:06.240 --> 35:12.000]  year because of the marines won't kill their own citizens so the bankers can feast on this country
[35:12.960 --> 35:19.280]  the mercs made up of latin american death squads and eastern european troops certainly will and
[35:19.280 --> 35:23.280]  you'll be called a terrorist if you fight back against foreigners having their way with you the
[35:23.280 --> 35:30.080]  american dream is about a foreigner having their way with you by the way i'm not joking about any
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.960]  of this okay you understand this is going to happen this is the plan unless you stand up and say no
[35:34.960 --> 35:40.960]  now go to your city councils stand up and speak and say many cities 800 plus pass laws against
[35:40.960 --> 35:44.880]  the patriot act being implemented well posse common taught us is still unconstitutional and
[35:44.880 --> 35:48.960]  it's criminal and we know the military has come in here and bought off a lot of you this is part
[35:48.960 --> 35:58.960]  of a takeover don't be part of it listen to this it says the third infantry's division first brigade
[35:58.960 --> 36:05.680]  combat team oh the combat team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in iraq patrolling in full-time
[36:05.680 --> 36:13.360]  battle rattle helping restore essential services and escorting supply convoys now they're training
[36:13.360 --> 36:20.240]  for the same mission with a twist at home they're getting ready for the battle rattle oh how cute
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.800]  and they're linking up with all the units that were secret but aren't now the units training
[36:26.800 --> 36:31.120]  that i videotaped to take your guns and break your family up and take your children from you
[36:31.680 --> 36:32.640]  all on video
[36:37.120 --> 36:40.320]  and they train the marines that you're lucky to be in the camp you know the marine
[36:40.320 --> 36:42.720]  shouted you when you're coming into the camp you're lucky to be here
[36:44.880 --> 36:47.760]  it's all disgusting psychology for weak little pea brains
[36:50.800 --> 36:54.560]  it is not i i i guess they couldn't get smiddly butler the two-time congressional medal of honor
[36:54.560 --> 36:59.680]  winner and in line number two in the in the marine corps command they promised him basically to be
[36:59.680 --> 37:04.880]  leader of the dictatorship but he went to congress and exposed it and it was the same deal then a
[37:04.880 --> 37:10.320]  covert military takeover by stealth over six months and then a hot flash takeover of the federal
[37:10.320 --> 37:19.040]  government but butler said no well the marines aren't going to say no this time i don't think
[37:20.240 --> 37:24.400]  it is not the first time in active duty so they use that too oh we we've had active duty
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.960]  before they help put out fires and help confiscate guns and Katrina beginning October 1st for 12
[37:30.960 --> 37:36.880]  months the first bct will be under the day-to-day control of the u.s. and army north which has
[37:36.880 --> 37:41.680]  us listed as a theater of operations the army service component of the northern command
[37:41.680 --> 37:45.680]  has an on-call federal response force for natural or man-made emergencies
[37:45.680 --> 37:50.640]  and disasters including terror attacks that north com carried out and don't give me north
[37:50.640 --> 37:56.240]  com wasn't set up it was set up in the early nineties slaves were told about it in 2001
[37:58.560 --> 38:04.560]  it is not the first time an active duty unit has been tapped to help at home to help help take
[38:04.560 --> 38:09.680]  those guns in august 2005 for example in hurricane Katrina unleashed hell in mississippi louisiana
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.840]  several active duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.200]  but this new mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assessment
[38:19.200 --> 38:25.280]  to north com a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal
[38:25.280 --> 38:30.400]  homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities coordinate that
[38:30.400 --> 38:37.680]  means command the civil authorities and repeat edd 51 read the john war defense authorization
[38:37.680 --> 38:43.920]  act it says to wage war against the american people it states it clearly in the john war
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.680]  defense authorization act and it says the governors are already vassals there's nothing but regional
[38:49.680 --> 38:57.200]  governors after the first bct finishes its dwell time mission expectations are that another
[38:57.200 --> 39:01.760]  as young unnamed active duty upgrade will take over and the mission will be a permanent one
[39:01.760 --> 39:07.200]  they're going to rotate them all in for domestic ops right now their response force requirement
[39:07.200 --> 39:14.240]  will be an enduring mission i bet it will be god almighty you get the butcher the fat hog usa
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.960]  like every other military does in an empire it's just happening here the poor fool public doesn't
[39:18.960 --> 39:24.720]  know they think it can happen how the defense department chooses to source that and whether
[39:24.720 --> 39:29.680]  or not they continue to assign them to north com that could change in the future said army colonel
[39:29.680 --> 39:37.840]  louis vogler chief of north com future operations now the plan is to assign a force every year the
[39:37.840 --> 39:43.120]  command is paterson air force base in colorado springs the us capital the real capital but the

[39:59.920 --> 40:05.200]  in war zones but then it goes on to mention they'll be doing counterinsurgency ops here
[40:05.200 --> 40:10.320]  there's two more pages it's very long and it mentions all the other
[40:12.320 --> 40:19.280]  support teams the covert ops the active army's new dwell time mission north com dod response
[40:19.280 --> 40:23.520]  package says other branches included active duty soldiers will be part of the force that includes
[40:23.520 --> 40:27.280]  elements from other military branches dedicated national guard weapons of mass destruction
[40:27.280 --> 40:34.400]  civil support teams that's the front for the payoffs of local mayors that's the cia front
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.520]  they ever get caught they show that to the public and while there's huge warehouses drug ops drug
[40:39.520 --> 40:46.160]  shipments the final mission rehearsal exercises scheduled for mid september at fort steward

[40:59.280 --> 41:05.200]  including elements of the first medical brigade out of fort hood and they use that again as a front

[41:11.200 --> 41:17.280]  air force engineer medical units and the marine corps and oh i'm sorry there's a whole other page
[41:17.280 --> 41:21.200]  here that didn't prevent i'll have to get that of all the other branches this is just who they're
[41:21.200 --> 41:30.160]  telling you about all cia commander now you can go back to my films made more than 10 years ago
[41:30.160 --> 41:35.760]  you can go back to uh all the shows we've done we said there's a covert giant operation building
[41:35.760 --> 41:40.080]  up we got the documents we got the police chiefs who they tried to buy off we got emergency managers
[41:40.080 --> 41:45.680]  like thomas sanchez over kingsville and he said look i'm an army vet and they came in and told
[41:45.680 --> 41:50.320]  me this is a martial law takeover program and you know offered me all these goodies to go along
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.600]  and i'm this is this is a violation of posse common taught us i'm not gonna be part of it
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.520]  thank god a lot of these guys are army vets and know that they were taught this was high treason
[41:59.520 --> 42:05.920]  20 30 40 years ago so they know when they've got black ops in their offices and playing
[42:05.920 --> 42:09.760]  clothes with bags of money they're like what on earth but other towns like alice texas
[42:10.400 --> 42:14.000]  where you got a former dea agent who's the police chief at least then in the films i don't know
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.600]  he is now jack decompton he just says look there are foreign troops here involved too and i'm not
[42:19.600 --> 42:26.080]  going to tell you who they are it's national security and when they tell you it has a foreign
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.560]  component when they tell the press that a foreign component of the training it's true of course they're
[42:30.560 --> 42:36.000]  going to use these skills other places but the government documents that we have and all the
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.040]  generals we've had on and and and the documents we've gotten ferreted out and the FEMA training
[42:41.040 --> 42:46.320]  and now the bills and the legislation and what congress admits see now it's out in the open it's
[42:46.320 --> 42:50.000]  this is domestic gun confiscation well i mean look there's so many examples i can't cover them all
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.160]  the governor two weeks ago three weeks ago now in this is a month now time flies
[42:57.600 --> 43:02.400]  of illinois announces with mayor daily uh we're going to use the national guard and regular army
[43:02.400 --> 43:06.720]  to assist in gun confiscation not just in chicago but statewide we're going to lock
[43:06.720 --> 43:11.920]  uh neighborhoods down and go door to door uh coming in and seeing if there's illegal guns
[43:11.920 --> 43:19.760]  i mean they just calmly announce in a press conference gun confiscation you don't hear a
[43:19.760 --> 43:25.600]  word out of the n r a you don't hear a word out of bob bar that little c i a spooky you don't hear
[43:25.600 --> 43:30.800]  a word this is their time it isn't enough to suck third world countries dry it isn't enough to use
[43:30.800 --> 43:34.720]  our tax money to pay for it so the international bankers can use our muscle dominate the planet
[43:34.720 --> 43:39.600]  it isn't enough to have tens of trillions of dollars of debt they're putting on our name and
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.320]  our children calling it a bailout this isn't a bailout we have the imf world bank documents
[43:44.960 --> 43:48.560]  this whole thing has been completely and totally engineered i'm gonna say this now
[43:51.920 --> 43:55.840]  steve watson's got a political science master's degree so maybe he can do it
[43:56.640 --> 44:00.400]  paul i know can do it but but one of you guys i'm i guess i'm gonna have to do it he's doing
[44:00.400 --> 44:07.120]  article explaining this is all by design no one is getting that except joseph stick was noble prize
[44:07.120 --> 44:10.800]  winner we had on he'll tell you the imf world bank have done this in hundreds of third world
[44:10.800 --> 44:15.840]  countries they said they wanted to do it in the west they are doing it uh the incredible news of the
[44:15.840 --> 44:23.680]  day out of big picture blog and then they point to the story out of um bloomberg it is confirmed
[44:23.680 --> 44:32.240]  now understand congress raises money congress was supposed to run funding but under pdd 51
[44:32.960 --> 44:37.120]  but congress is at the same level as the president they can't do this they're equals
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.520]  but congress passes the laws and appropriations the president executes
[44:43.520 --> 44:52.640]  it's just amazing what i'm about to tell you and i have a stack all of it is this this important
[44:54.800 --> 45:01.040]  and it's so mind-blowing to see it happen congress on monday started arguing and some
[45:01.040 --> 45:06.560]  republicans started at least for their constituents shooting their mouths off and saying hey we may
[45:06.560 --> 45:12.400]  not do these bailouts of aig and you know 87 and 100 billion dollar and then leverage 100 times in
[45:12.400 --> 45:17.600]  the tens of trillions and huge 50 something trillion dollar bailouts of fanny man freddie
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.960]  mack and it's all leveraged we may not be part of this we know we get to debate this
[45:23.520 --> 45:28.160]  and henry paulson the treasury secretary came out and i have his quotes that's in bloomberg
[45:28.160 --> 45:34.720]  and said let me explain something you're not involved in this and they invoked pdd 51 and
[45:34.720 --> 45:39.280]  said you don't run anything sit down and shut up you see that military
[45:39.280 --> 45:45.600]  country they were brought up on mercury vaccines in florida they like to kill people they'll do
[45:45.600 --> 45:51.600]  whatever i say sit down and shut up we're looting everything you got it
[45:54.400 --> 46:00.080]  i mean this is worse than i even thought it would be listen to this paulson's says congress has no
[46:00.080 --> 46:04.320]  authority here the big picture blog up on info wars dot com all this is up on info wars dot com
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.720]  as with any contract the parties of the government may modify the covenants by mutual agreement only
[46:11.520 --> 46:15.040]  treasurer secretary henry paulson so see they're saying congress isn't involved in any of this
[46:15.760 --> 46:19.920]  henry paulson's god complex just got bigger the director of government bailouts and the
[46:19.920 --> 46:24.960]  head of socialism department at the treasury has informed congress to back off his turf
[46:26.240 --> 46:30.480]  all your legislation belongs to us and when i first wrote this i said i don't believe it
[46:30.480 --> 46:38.480]  then i read bloomberg ap and when the what they foot noted he said it
[46:46.240 --> 46:48.160]  i mean this is the type of stuff we're dealing with
[46:51.680 --> 46:56.320]  now last i checked it was congress that had the power of authorization of disbursements
[46:56.320 --> 47:01.200]  and the treasury does not have the authority to spend 5.3 trillion dollars comrad and by the way
[47:01.200 --> 47:07.600]  that's just what they admitted is it's leveraged okay conservatively a hundred times comrad paulson
[47:07.600 --> 47:12.720]  you stand duplicated ponzi'd leverage you know what that means it's in the hundreds of trillions
[47:12.720 --> 47:16.720]  conservatively i don't know what's a hundred times five point seven trillions five hundred
[47:16.720 --> 47:22.640]  something trillium or five point three trillion what's a hundred times five point three trillion
[47:22.640 --> 47:29.200]  five hundred something trillium comrad paulson does not seem to understand the way the different
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.920]  branches of government work in the united states oh he understands that they've got
[47:33.920 --> 47:39.920]  battle seasoned totally psychopathic soldiers by design put through four or five tours who've
[47:39.920 --> 47:45.360]  got every screw loose who are ready to come back here and eat their guts and ask for seconds
[47:45.360 --> 47:53.760]  he understands big picture block i love how people i'm not bashing these guys is a great
[47:53.760 --> 47:58.480]  story the point is i love how they always think that the government doesn't understand oh they
[47:58.480 --> 48:04.800]  understand comrad paulson does not seem to understand the way the different branches of
[48:04.800 --> 48:08.880]  the government work in the united states and it's apparently unfamiliar with a little
[48:08.880 --> 48:12.880]  parchment called the constitution well bush that on you know it's a gd piece of paper
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.040]  perhaps we can get ron paul to explain how these things work to our friend from the people's
[48:17.040 --> 48:23.360]  republic of goldman yeah he's a former goldman sax head bill king hank is trying to ensure the
[48:23.360 --> 48:29.280]  market into believing that if congress tries to change the law the executive branch would then
[48:29.280 --> 48:34.160]  sue congress for breach of contract good luck with that at the supreme court nice try comrad
[48:34.160 --> 48:41.760]  but no such luck these issue here is authorization i cannot write a contract to sell your home car
[48:41.760 --> 48:46.400]  except for the third party without your authorization otherwise it's fraud the party with the legal
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.360]  title and ability to convey those goods or services on the one side for indebtedness
[48:51.360 --> 48:56.320]  or money on the other side of the transaction requires authorization the original bazooka
[48:56.320 --> 49:03.200]  legislation did not give treasury a blank check to do whatever they want a decision for example to
[49:03.200 --> 49:08.080]  add fanny and freddy to the budget wouldn't automatically translate into explicit government
[49:08.080 --> 49:13.360]  backing for the companies combined with 1.7 trillion in the unsecured debt of 3.5 trillion
[49:13.360 --> 49:19.360]  of mortgage guarantees to do so requires congressional legislation to change the company's legal status
[49:19.360 --> 49:25.120]  that's where any of the changes like reducing the absurd pay package for the current idiots
[49:25.120 --> 49:30.480]  running fanny and freddy would come in these aren't idiots they've quietly militarized the police
[49:30.480 --> 49:34.960]  and bought off governments for 20 plus years and have been building fema camps and preparing the
[49:34.960 --> 49:40.400]  public for this they're not idiots they're precision criminals total precision
[49:48.640 --> 49:52.560]  and then he has all the footnotes here i mean these are quotes out of bloomberg us treasury
[49:52.560 --> 49:56.640]  said fanny and freddy mac debt and mortgage backed securities are protected by the government
[49:56.640 --> 50:00.960]  stock purchase agreement that put the mortgage finance companies under federal control the
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.840]  holders of senior debt sub subordinated debt and mortgage backed debt
[50:08.080 --> 50:14.160]  securities issued or guaranteed by these gsc are protected by the agreement without regard to those
[50:14.160 --> 50:17.920]  securities were issued or guaranteed the treasuries are today referring to the so-called
[50:17.920 --> 50:25.280]  government sponsored enterprises then it goes on with him on bloomberg television saying the same
[50:25.280 --> 50:31.280]  thing uh where did the facts from this article come from uh treasury dot gov they have a link to
[50:31.280 --> 50:37.520]  that and also bloomberg okay so so understand see they're not just telling congress you can't see
[50:37.520 --> 50:43.680]  the homeland security plan our pd 51 the cover sheet says the president's dictator so we know what it

[54:23.600 --> 54:28.560]  basically all global currencies and destroy the financial system while the elites have
[54:28.560 --> 54:33.280]  positioned themselves in commodities and infrastructure and then they're going to pose
[54:33.280 --> 54:39.200]  as the savior and roll out the world i d cards down the road after years and years of depression
[54:39.200 --> 54:43.760]  and problems and people will say what do we do to get jobs oh you join the homeland security team

[55:26.080 --> 55:31.360]  web down claiming terrorist cyber attacked it and then oh we've got to have web registration to
[55:31.360 --> 55:35.200]  and they're saying this the un is meeting today i got the news article in the stack
[55:35.200 --> 55:41.360]  the un's meeting today now over in brussels with the communist chinese government the nsa
[55:41.920 --> 55:47.120]  on a global registration system to make you do that i mean it it's all happening they're all
[55:47.120 --> 55:54.480]  teamed up together against us and henry paulson says hey congress you're not involved you have
[55:54.480 --> 56:00.800]  no say on whether the treasury and the private fellow reserve bail all this out because they
[56:00.800 --> 56:05.520]  say congress you signed contracts in 1913 yeah but they're fraudulent contracts
[56:07.920 --> 56:13.840]  and congress has to levy those funds i mean but see congress is the congressmen the congress
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.040]  women the senators they know the media will back up the president which represents the
[56:19.040 --> 56:22.960]  military industrial complex so they can't individually really speak out the ron paul and
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.200]  others are and they get too upbeat they'll just be killed they've killed congressmen in their
[56:27.200 --> 56:32.400]  offices before they blow their planes up kill their families that's what they do
[56:34.800 --> 56:38.560]  and plus most of congress has bought and paid for an all part of the gravy drink
[56:38.560 --> 56:45.120]  it is an orgy of looting and evil going on and it's a fact you know the economy is going into
[56:45.120 --> 56:50.880]  depression right now i've got your spiegel bbc associated press the world as we know it is

[56:58.880 --> 57:02.800]  they would have kept lying and saying everything's great that wasn't the case bush has now come out
[57:02.800 --> 57:09.760]  today and said okay things are really bad and they may even bump it back up for a while but
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.200]  then it'll just go back down maybe two or three more bumps but this may be it you know where
[57:13.200 --> 57:18.320]  they pump it back up a little and it plunges again this may be it all the experts we've had on

[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:05.760]  farce he did that i want to get the aftermath of that i also uh with david ike he's been for over
[1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:10.800]  a decade predicting this world financial collapse by design no one is saying that even the imf
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:16.560]  world bank documents from 2001 2002 admit it's by design and joseph sticklets noble prize winner
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:22.880]  came on here two days ago and said on air uh that yes you know basically this is engineered
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:28.320]  as he said a few years ago on the show so we've got david icon about that and where he sees the
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:32.800]  future going i mean you know they they they gear up the police state they stage a terror attack to
[1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:38.240]  roll that out publicly then they cause a financial implosion where people will be more apt to grovel
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:43.520]  to them in this modern system believing that their masters will take care of them so go to david

[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:40.080]  got to start talking louder than ever because uh this is moving on so fast well there's a quickening
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:44.800]  happening and i don't know how soon you cut off there when we first got you on the global financial
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:50.880]  meltdown this is being engineered we have their own documents oh absolutely we've got our own one
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:56.640]  here today with the biggest mortgage lender in britain the halifax bank of scotland being uh taken
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:05.280]  over by lord's tsp and then you've got a situation where you've got a uh a merged company halifax
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:11.680]  and bank of scotland being taken over now by another merge company loids and tsp we're now in
[1:03:11.680 --> 1:03:18.640]  a situation where um it's not just big fish taking over smaller fish it's big fish being taken over
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:27.200]  by mega fish and and one aspect of this halix is um the rapid um speed of if you like globalization
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:33.040]  centralization of power in the banking system as is um being accepted here this merger today
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:40.960]  which is now giving this merged merged company 40 percent currently of uh of british current
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:49.360]  accounts would never have been allowed by the monopoly laws but because of um the the problems
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:54.400]  this big more biggest mortgage lender has had and was going to collapse that's all put aside and now
[1:03:54.400 --> 1:04:00.720]  we have this mega mega banking operation and and as you say it's moving it's moving so fast and uh
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:07.760]  and uh in the end we're now seeing in our face what has always been the case it's always been
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:13.280]  the case that a few have controlled the banking system but they've used a stream of of front
[1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:19.680]  names and masks now the mask is lifting and we're seeing this uh this in front of our eyes now
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:25.280]  well you're absolutely right the imf and world bank documents stated that they do this in third
[1:04:25.280 --> 1:04:29.680]  world countries that they wanted to do this in the west uh the quote bailout is the real theft
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:34.800]  because the elites already took the real assets out of the banks and then and and and then leveraged
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:39.840]  them into other assets and then took those assets out into infrastructure and commodities and now
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:45.760]  they're going to leave us holding the entire bag uh not to bail them out but to get us into
[1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:50.480]  greater debt uh we're going to skip this break uh with david ike right now so we can have more
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:56.720]  time with him stay with us uh david let's continue and if your phone uh if the connection cuts out

[1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:14.240]  john harman john's been my on-site engineer up in minnesota i'm down in texas for the last four
[1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:20.960]  years and he is the best uh on-site uh off-site producer i've ever had say hi to david john
[1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:26.240]  hello mr ike how you doing hello john all right mate nice to talk to you okay to explain you too
[1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:32.720]  uh to explain this on the job you do you know we we need we need uh as many people who uh who
[1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:38.880]  know how the system works the uh as we can because uh we really got to get this out now well too thank
[1:05:38.880 --> 1:05:44.000]  you sir to explain how this works uh only the internet audience will hear us in these behind the
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:49.440]  scene discussions but still that tends out that tends to even be a bigger audience in the aggregate
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:55.360]  yeah the amon fm's and satellite come back after the break but in the aggregate over time this all
[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:00.080]  gets put as video we're on prisonplanet.tv right now streaming live it'll be archived later and
[1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:06.080]  then it gets ripped to youtube and live link and uh emotion uh uh and all the other big sites that
[1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:09.760]  are out there so we'll be covering it uh we're going to come back to the full audience in two
[1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:14.480]  minutes but i'm going to skip some of the breaks this hour uh if that's okay with you but just
[1:06:14.480 --> 1:06:18.400]  give us a preview what are some of the things i've mentioned what i want to talk about the
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:22.560]  engineered implosion of the economy sounds like you do want to go there david but what are some
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:29.280]  of the other things you want to talk about well i think um the uh the important thing is to know
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:36.000]  where they want to take us and uh this manipulation now quite blatant of the financial markets is
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:42.960]  taking us um in that direction uh of a world government world army world central bank um
[1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:48.880]  world currency world uh microchip population and what what we're seeing now is the dramatic
[1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:55.520]  centralization of power in the banking system because in the end um they want just one uh
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:07:00.720]  centralized world banking system they will want centralized everything and the more that they are
[1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:08.720]  dismantling uh choice the more they dismantling uh diversity even apparent diversity um the more
[1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:13.920]  they're um hurtling towards this this point of centralization that's right everything that um
[1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:20.400]  i feel that it's important to um to understand is on another level of this uh creating this
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:24.240]  structure like the world army and the world government they want a world war they want a
[1:07:24.240 --> 1:07:31.120]  third world war and and we've reached the point now where they're now starting to throw uh everything
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:38.480]  they can at us the kitchen sinkers because um they're um desperate to bring this in in not a
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:43.600]  long time scale and therefore they're uh they're throwing everything at us that they can and the
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:51.360]  more they can create fear on a financial level on a uh a conflict level whatever the more people
[1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:55.840]  are going to open up to tell us tell us how we can we can we can bring an answer stay there let's
[1:07:55.840 --> 1:08:00.560]  cover we'll be their agenda of the global fascist state david we're coming back live here we go
[1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:10.560]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin
[1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:24.160]  texas alex jones the financial collapse that we are witnessing has been engineered that's in the
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:33.520]  imf and world bank document plans the rothschilds in 1815 this is mainline history knew that the
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:38.640]  polian had lost they had their fast ships race across the channel hours before anybody else
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:45.920]  and say that lord wellington uh and the austrians have lost uh and then the stocks plunged by 98%
[1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:50.400]  as we cover in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement and then they bought up the entire
[1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:55.360]  stock exchange and the brokerage houses and banking houses for pennies on the dollar and it
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:00.400]  is the same thing with the five false pillars of these big brokerage houses and banks they have
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:05.360]  done this by design and now at the end of the ponzi scheme people think this is saving the economy
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:12.000]  or bailing it out uh treasure secretary paulson has even told uh the congress you're not involved
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.280]  in this and congresses but we're involved in funding and they said look we have a private
[1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:20.480]  government now into the federal reserve that's in the news and so you have it all openly consolidating
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:24.480]  down to one system and david ike's going to be talking about how this has been engineered he's
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:27.840]  been predicting this for more than a decade and then we're going to get into how they want to
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:33.840]  also create world war three global conflict to create the fear so that they can sell the cashless
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:38.960]  society control grid they have to destroy the dollar destroy the pound destroy the old order
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:44.160]  while they've been building the new world order this this this technological enslavement system
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:49.920]  uh enslavement grid and now they have to get rid of the old so that the new can fully emerge this
[1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:55.120]  is all on paper not just our opinion and so david's going to break all this down with us uh in the
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:10:04.000]  next uh 55 minutes that we have left with him uh david ike please continue well you know we've reached
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:10.480]  the point in this um in this unfolding uh conspiracy to create this centralized global
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:16.960]  or welly and state where it's broken the surface i mean for a long time it was operating under the
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:24.880]  surface where people couldn't see it but for it to become uh in stored in place it had at some point
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:30.080]  have to break the surface where people can actually see it so this is a time of a great
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:36.000]  challenge but it's also a time of great opportunity because people um uh more and more can't just go
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.960]  into denial and and and ask what when the next game shows on because this is now starting to
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:48.320]  impact on their lives and i just got back from coasia um where the the the the interest in this uh
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:54.240]  whole uh information that we put out is just which just took me aback people are starting to wake up
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:11:01.840]  to it and uh so the challenge uh yes there is but there's also an opportunity as people can see
[1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:07.440]  that what we've been saying is actually now i'm happening so those two things are going together
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:14.960]  and uh in this uh if you like final run into this uh uh or welly in uh in position that they want
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:19.680]  and is of course unfolding very very fast all over the world they're now throwing everything
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:26.160]  they can at this they want to hit us from emotionally financially on all um levels and
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:31.200]  one of them of course is is is creating fear through finance because money is is what everyone
[1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:36.720]  is frightened of not having in this world where it is so important to choice in life and living
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:44.320]  and survival but they're also going to hit us and uh on the level of a third world war i'm
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:48.960]  absolutely convinced and have been for a very long time they want a third world war involving
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:55.760]  north america particularly europe russia and china and this whole business in georgia has been part
[1:11:55.760 --> 1:12:03.600]  of the moving of the chess pieces to uh advance that along the road to when it actually breaks out
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:09.520]  and possibly involving the middle eastern israel is a trigger but it's a time when we've really
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:15.600]  got to um reevaluate our lives and reevaluate our priorities and realize that we're facing
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:20.960]  not just a massive challenge for ourselves now but an enormous challenge for our children and
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:26.080]  grandchildren that's right if we don't say no now they're going to be able to the the the new world
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:29.680]  order social architects as you know in their own textbooks going back a hundred years ago
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:34.000]  and the different phd's were put out from germany and england on this said they they
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:38.880]  unfreeze societies with crisis and fear because societies are normally rigid people like the
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:44.880]  status quo but they say it's a danger because they when things are unfrozen can mold things the way
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:51.920]  they want but also the resistance can mold things and so this is that window the enemy's window our
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:57.040]  window that's why all of you have got to shine brighter than ever what david was saying is that
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:02.080]  everything is yin and yang in this world every for every action an equal reaction and so all over
[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:07.840]  the world nine eleven truth everything is exploding like never before the disinfo operatives are telling
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:11.920]  us it's all dead they're panicking you know they're trying to tell us you've already lost you will be
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:16.560]  assimilated when we have a really big chance here and talk about orwellian a sneak attack
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:22.800]  by the us and israel back nato back georgia on these russian enclaves and talk about mind control
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:27.600]  our media comes in says russia snuck attack i mean if that is an orwellian please continue
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:35.920]  well the whole thing in georgia came originally from the uh... the so-called people's revolution
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:42.560]  there and uh... these some people's revolutions the spontaneous uh... people's uh... protest
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:49.200]  which led to the overturning of the of the regime in power um... were invariably manipulated to bring
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:57.360]  that about i mean in in georgia the um... so-called rose revolution uh... which involved uh... in a
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:04.720]  high-profile way a man called charcos molly who then became the president um... was funded by george
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:12.160]  sorris and uh... students were trained in large numbers in the art of civil disobedience and
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:19.680]  civil protest which led to that until not only did uh... the forces that control uh... american
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:25.680]  society uh... take advantage of the georgian revolution and then turned it into yet another
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:31.280]  fifty-first state of the united states um... they actually created the revolution in the first place
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:36.880]  and this happened throughout and there's always there's always a european communist country and
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:42.000]  david there's always other layers meanwhile soros acts like he's against bush but then it turns
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:48.320]  out his funded group work with the cia and with bush and mccain's uh... advisor who's georgian
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:52.800]  so again uh... on the surface they're fighting with each other but behind the scenes they're not
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:57.840]  it's like mary maddlin's and married to george carvel uh... and you know exactly and the the
[1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:05.120]  the thing is that i've seen uh... people responding to this uh... invasion of south asetia by georgia
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:11.040]  and then the uh... russian response uh... as if hey you know uh... the americans have got to be crazy
[1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:16.960]  or or whatever uh... did not realize russia was going to respond like that of course they did that's
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:23.920]  part of the game it's causing this uh... rushing up of the fear the rushing up of the yeah that
[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:28.720]  crashed the the russian stock market that was going up all ours was going down now theirs has
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:35.600]  been shut down for two days yeah i mean these are all masks on the same face it's a chessboard
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:41.040]  order out of chaos even wrote about yes it's a chessboard and we've seen the pieces uh... moving
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:47.680]  around and what i would say to people is if if you think um... you know you don't like the world
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:53.520]  as it is now what it ain't gonna stay like this this is not the point where they wish to be and
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:16:00.080]  and and pitch their tent and say okay we've got control they want to push this forward uh...
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:06.960]  in in in a much more extreme way even it is now far more and if it's bad now what is it gonna be
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:12.000]  like for our children and our grandchildren they're gonna have to live most of their lives
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:17.200]  in this uh... orwellian nightmare that he's moving so fast they're not even gonna live
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:20.720]  david they're not even gonna live in fact you've written about this before i was even on the scene
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:26.720]  but i want you to get into the population plan open un biological diversity assessments open
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:32.720]  uh... government plans pdds uh... uh... state apartment random two hundred uh... the royal
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:38.720]  commission on population it is world government is only a means to an end let's talk about that
[1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:44.640]  end where they debate whether to kill one hundred percent of the humans and then make themselves
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:50.720]  the cybernetic god creatures that's not me that's them that's mainline or and i'm saying that's
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:54.320]  real that's what they believe you know david would say that that probably is the point is
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:17:00.000]  is that it's so wild what they write and say the debate is kill everyone or kill ninety nine percent
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.800]  or kill down to eighty percent david talk about that of the end game but where this is going
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:12.400]  well the point i i really want to get over is that you know i have i've been uh... you know
[1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:19.600]  with this for for many many years as you have and um... in the end we we as people people
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:27.120]  listening to the show and all shows like it we've got a uh... move from just learning more and more
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:32.640]  and more about our own present and how it works that's important to know it really is
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:37.520]  we've got to get to the point now where we say what the heck are we going to do about it and we
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:43.840]  have to stop uh... uh... being divided and ruled by the fault lines of religion and class and
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:51.120]  income bracket and culture and country and realize that uh... where we're going here and the cell
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:59.520]  door is swinging and and we've just got a bit of time here to stop it crashing shut but not
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:05.760]  if we just talk about it and shout about it we've got to start getting organized and and
[1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:14.640]  respond to this and what we need is to stop uh... uh... cooperating with our own enslavement we
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:21.680]  need you know that uh... peaceful uh... non-cooperation with the system here's one here's
[1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:27.360]  one everybody otherwise we're building our own prison everybody should put up a micro fm
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:32.960]  and carry radio shows like this it's civil disobedience we've got north com declaring martial law
[1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:38.080]  right here in the army times saying regular brigades of army troops will be in the u s i agree
[1:18:38.080 --> 1:18:42.880]  you'll put up micros to keep to show the slaves their prison to unlock their minds but us at a
[1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:47.440]  higher level go to the city council say don't be part of this don't be part of martial law
[1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:52.080]  david uh... how else do we not comply i mean what do we do when they put a camera up by our house
[1:18:53.920 --> 1:19:02.240]  well in the end we've got a uh... peacefully resist the imposition of this enslavement and
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:07.520]  and even on the ticket real simple level uh... we need in britain now you can get fine seventy
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:14.240]  five pounds uh... for uh... putting your trash can out on the road in a on the wrong day now
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:20.000]  instead of and i hear it all the time alex oh what's the world coming to all i don't know
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:24.960]  whatever next i don't know it's terrible isn't it and then and and and then they switch the game
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:31.520]  show on we've got to start all of us whether we christian or muslim or or or jewish or whatever
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:37.360]  this this prison is not for one group it's for all of us who are not part of they play us off
[1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:42.400]  against each other to control us stay there we're gonna talk behind scenes for info wars dot com
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:47.200]  stream listeners and prison planet dot tv viewers david ike's coming to the us check it out at
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:55.600]  davidike dot com stay with us okay david continue with examples of saying no continue with examples
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:02.640]  of i mean it starts small start a blog call into a talk show go to a city council uh... say no i mean
[1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:07.920]  i'm not saying climb up a pole at night and beat a camera up with a baseball bat i'm not saying go
[1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:12.560]  up on a corporate billboard and spray paint info wars dot com or davidike dot com i'm not saying
[1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:20.640]  go that far like the founding fathers would have uh... david yeah the thing is um you know
[1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:27.760]  we've got a rich point now where one person's injustice um and one person's uh um imposition
[1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:34.480]  by the state is ours so um when one person is treated um unjustly by the state for doing
[1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:40.720]  something then then large vast numbers of people immediately do it you know a simple thing like
[1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:45.840]  uh you put your wheelie back been out on the on the wrong day the council gives you five to seventy
[1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:51.040]  five pounds the next thing you know the council is dealing with thousands of people putting
[1:20:51.040 --> 1:20:56.880]  their wheelie been out on the wrong day um uh indefinitely until the law's changed or refusing
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:04.000]  to pay um uh taxes to the council until the law's changed we've got to start doing this otherwise
[1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:10.800]  we're just going to complain and moan and basically watch the prison being built and and more and more
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:16.160]  knowing it's being built and and understanding how it's built but actually still not intervening
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:19.680]  in the process of it being built well david here's a quick example i remember like eight
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:24.640]  years ago it was in louisiana big five-a-school people can look it up it was in world net daily
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:28.400]  and the associate press in other places because i had some of the kids on it was a high school
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:33.200]  young men and women and they just said you've all got to wear id badges around your neck
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:38.000]  and first they showed how you could read the barcode and learn just viewing it what somebody
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  sell security number was so that show that was unsecured and one girl said no they expelled her
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.080]  and then about 20 said no they expelled them and then like half the school said no and they
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:53.520]  expelled all them and then they had to back off and remove it and and and that that's an example
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:58.800]  right there of saying no no no that that's what we need to do you see we had a wonderful example
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:02.320]  in this country um a few years ago which i was actually involved in when i was in the green
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:09.760]  part of the card yeah second it was a national ID card wasn't yeah no it was it was a margaret
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:16.080]  thatcher a tax called the poll tax which um uh a taxed people of high income the same as people
[1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:23.200]  of low income it was a local poll tax and because and this is the important thing alex because it
[1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:29.600]  didn't just um uh hit the the if you like the working classes as we call them here it hit the
[1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:36.080]  middle classes as well there the fault line was removed because there was a mutual um effect on
[1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:42.480]  both uh groups as a result there was a vast movement in this country which i was involved in um uh
[1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:48.080]  myself in um not paying that tax refusing to pay the tax some people went to jail because of it
[1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:54.640]  but what actually happened was so many people didn't pay it the tax had to be withdrawn and and
[1:22:54.640 --> 1:23:00.720]  it was a fundamental reason why margaret thatcher um lost her power um so these are the things that
[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:08.800]  we can do the point is oh my god there are billions of ours and at the core who know the big picture
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:14.720]  of what they're doing there is a relative relative handful of the people doing it i think i see a way
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:21.280]  out of this and and but we have to unite and we have to take a deep breath and we have to stop
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:26.880]  being frightened of authority and realize that in the end it's frightened of us well they're scared
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:33.120]  to death of us i mean look at how the system uh is trying to chill demonstrations protests trying
[1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:39.120]  to intimidate people and uh now everybody can see that we're being looted that that the treasuries
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:43.840]  being robbed that trillions and debts being piled on all our names and it's an illegitimate
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:48.720]  fraudulent debt and there's no discussion in the corporate media of any of these criminals
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:53.200]  even being investigated or going to jail here we go full audience okay
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:24:04.080]  david ike uh quite a uh rebel certainly an icon uh when you talk about the awakening movement
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:09.840]  the waking life that we're all uh living here we're always honored to have him on with us
[1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:15.520]  as things quicken as things accelerate and get worse a lot faster i want to have david on more
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:22.240]  and more uh and we respect his time but it's just great to have him here with us because what he
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:26.480]  does is very important he's been right about everything he's talked about coming true and
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:32.320]  he gets people to really get outside the box uh in his own uh you know own way uh you know very
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:36.320]  well spoken and and you know comes at things from a great angle so we love having david ike
[1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:41.200]  with us and he's coming to the united states uh in late september uh in early october check out
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:47.680]  more at david ike dot com he'll be in california uh three dates only twice in santa clara on the
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:54.400]  27 the 28th and once in los angeles again details at david ike dot com uh david of course those
[1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:58.000]  always sell out folks you better get tickets now don't wait till the last day and then why and
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:03.280]  scream about it uh that's that's part of the good thing david can sell out 3000 4000 5000
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:08.880]  person ballrooms now uh and and and you know going back decades ago uh maybe five people
[1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:14.560]  would show up but that's because and and and really isn't that the power we have is that we saw it
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:19.600]  nothing special about us we just saw uh behind the curtain a little bit earlier than other people
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:24.160]  and have gone deeper down that rabbit hole you you know probably deeper than me in some respects
[1:25:24.160 --> 1:25:30.080]  uh and and then we so much of what we said came true exactly as we said it would and so people
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:37.040]  are really paying attention now david yes they are and and you know i i but i just want to keep
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:42.560]  emphasizing you know with the with the uh the major audience that we're back talking to now
[1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:50.720]  that um we really got to start moving from just understanding more about the game and the situation
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:58.960]  we face to doing something about it there are billions of people being manipulated along
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:06.720]  this road there are a relative handful of people at the core in full knowledge of what they're doing
[1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:14.720]  who are actually doing the manipulating we do not have to go down this road if we wake up first of
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:22.640]  all to what's happening and then start to react to it i remember alex uh was a a movie um an animated
[1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:29.280]  movie some years ago called a bug's life for people who um who don't remember it it was about um a
[1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:36.800]  small group of grasshoppers who um controlled through fear a massive uh group of um ants on a
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:44.240]  place called an island and they got these ants all the year to gather food uh to to to uh give to
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:50.160]  the grasshoppers when they come once a year to fetch it and there's one scene that was so encapsulating
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:56.240]  of what we're talking about here they were the grasshoppers were in like their their their winter
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:01.840]  quarters in some tree or or other and they had all the food they needed and the the leader came
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:08.000]  along and said we've got to go down to an island and one of the uh smaller guys said well what
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.720]  do we have to go to an island for yeah we got all the food we need we don't need that food what do
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:19.760]  we need it for and then he stood up and he made a speech about the facts of life if you are the
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:26.560]  few and you need to control the many and um what had happened um in a previous scene is one ant
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:31.040]  the last time they went to an island to get the food had stood up and challenged what they
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:36.880]  were doing and questioned what they were doing and he said basically it's not about the food
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:44.720]  it's about keeping them under control and this was the line I remember there's a few of us basically
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:53.600]  and there are uh enormous numbers of them we need them more than they need us and if they ever figure
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:28:01.200]  that out there goes our way of life what we need to do now Alex now we're gathering this understanding
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:08.480]  of what's happening is is to figure that out we do not have to be controlled by the few um when
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:14.080]  we are the vast majority what happens is we're divided and ruled we fight among each other on
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:19.760]  religion and and and and politics and income bracket and culture and country and all these
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:24.720]  and the enemy facilitates that even in our own uh truth movements patriot movements they send in
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:30.720]  the people to create dissent who then stand back and go I I've not done anything I'm I'm being
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:34.800]  persecuted so they get those fights going so I think it's important to ignore those fights
[1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:39.040]  and move forward with issues in fact we played that clip many times here on air years ago John
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:44.240]  Stevens told the computer it's where he says hey boss what do you care about one ant he goes listen
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:51.120]  they outnumber us a hundred to one and if they ever figure that out it's over for us yeah and and
[1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:56.320]  that's what we need to figure out now um because um at the moment what's happening you've got this
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:00.480]  pyramid you've got the few at the top of we're doing it you've got the vast majority at the
[1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:07.680]  bottom or being manipulated but also in that middle sector you've got people who are fundamentally
[1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:15.840]  important to the agenda unfolding and playing out into society who don't know this to extend to the
[1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:20.640]  game they're playing a party and they have children and they have grandchildren I talked to some in
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:26.400]  the last uh uh little while and they're now starting to go hold on a second what are we actually
[1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:32.800]  um installing here without realizing it and if we get to those people the pyramid starts to
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:38.080]  melt exactly stay there David well let's continue behind the scenes for info wars.com stream listeners
[1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:43.440]  only um we'll be right back for everybody else please stay with us we're I just don't want to
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:49.600]  waste any of this time uh John can you find that clip I'm looking on YouTube I'm trying I used to
[1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:53.920]  play it like eight nine years ago and I've heard other shows play it uh here on the networks you
[1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:58.480]  might look in some of their files I forget the shows I think I've heard it on Dave and Joyce shows
[1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:03.920]  and and on JC Clayton show and some of the others so just uh look in there and see if you can find
[1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:11.760]  that uh for folks uh okay uh David let's continue I mean I'm glad you're focused in on this because
[1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:16.160]  but but you're so deep in the understanding and I understand tens of millions in the U.S. and
[1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:20.800]  hundreds of millions maybe even a billion worldwide or somewhat awake now you know to a deeper
[1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:27.520]  understanding but I I think we need to continue trying to broadcast with the new massive people
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:33.360]  we've woken up if they continue the process of just trying to get the the the the mind controlled
[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:39.680]  zombies to to be break you know to be taken out of the matrix pod then we can go to the next level
[1:30:39.680 --> 1:30:45.440]  so I think we should simultaneously resist and say no no no and get others to say no no no but
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:52.080]  continue to inform and educate and expose yes absolutely I'm not saying stop putting the info
[1:30:52.080 --> 1:30:56.320]  out and let's do something no no no I know you're not saying that I was saying yeah I know
[1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:01.120]  but they have to be simultaneous absolutely I couldn't agree more and because there are still
[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:07.760]  um uh enormous amounts of people who are still solid gold concrete asleep it's just the numbers
[1:31:07.760 --> 1:31:13.200]  are getting greater but those who are awake those who are beginning to see it and no longer in
[1:31:13.200 --> 1:31:18.400]  denial about it they're the ones that are now that have got to say oh okay what do we do about it
[1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:25.920]  and you know it's one of the things I say in my talks no more excuses there's no more excuses
[1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:32.400]  look in the eyes of your children and grandchildren and tell them your excuses we now have to get
[1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:39.840]  seriously active and and organize this non-cooperation with this system because if we don't cooperate
[1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:44.320]  it can't function absolutely let me see if this is the clip right here
[1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:52.080]  oh for some reason it's not playing on this computer I want to I have it oh wait we have it
[1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:57.360]  we'll play it when we come back I got obsessed with that it's just so powerful it says so much
[1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:03.120]  in a few words really yeah I've actually got it up on uh screen uh two for folks so we're also on
[1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:10.880]  tv at prisonplanet.tv you know David things are accelerating at every level and and and the evil
[1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:14.240]  even though I consciously knew that they were going to do this and I intellectually knew all
[1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:20.320]  this would be happening it's still amazing and shocking to be here and to see the awakening
[1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:25.360]  happening that that we foresaw and that you foresaw it's just extraordinary I'll tell you
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:31.360]  Alex my experience just now in Croatia last week just took me back I I didn't know whether I'd um
[1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:37.440]  I'd landed at an airport or a space station on another planet because um you know I was all over
[1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:44.080]  the mainstream media um their version of the BBC I was in the main news magazine there was a two page
[1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:47.920]  feature in the main stay there we're coming back live I want to hear about this sorry to interrupt
[1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:52.400]  we have to go back live to the full audience here we go okay no problem play the clip whenever you
[1:32:52.400 --> 1:33:02.480]  want John you let one aunt stand up to us then they all might stand up those puny little ants
[1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:12.000]  outnumber us a hundred to one but we're not puny little ants we're human beings made the image
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:17.680]  of the creator we are amazing dynamic creatures stop groveling in the dirt for jewels and goblets
[1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:23.200]  and cars start caring about liberty and freedom that's what generates all that wealth that's
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:28.640]  why the enemies of freedom came here to take it over the birthplace of modern liberty England
[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:34.240]  and the United States the Rothschilds took over there in 1815 totally and they've taken over here
[1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:39.440]  in 1913 and they are running us directly into the ground uh David Ike uh from the behind the
[1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:44.160]  scenes folks that were listening at infoworks.com and watching on prisonplanet.tv you started telling
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:48.960]  a story of landing in Croatian it was like you were at a spaceport it's the same thing
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.880]  I'm sent photos every day in Russia in Germany in Czech Republic in Japan bridges with info
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:34:04.240]  wars.com on it Australia and then I go on Russian TV Iranian TV other foreign TV Japanese TV comes
[1:34:04.240 --> 1:34:08.560]  and interviews me and it's like they're falling over themselves going oh everyone loves you in
[1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:13.040]  our country oh everyone is waking up to the new world order may I have your autograph and it's
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:19.440]  it's presenters on TV and I'm just one guy in this so I can't imagine what happened to you in
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:25.680]  Croatia tell us about it. Well it was it was just incredible I mean you know you you you put this
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:29.600]  information out and then you put more information out the next day and the more information out
[1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:35.360]  the next day you don't really understand where it actually goes and the the the the the the rate
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:39.920]  that it's it's picked up around the world and I went into Croatia and not knowing what to expect
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:44.560]  and like I said I didn't whether I'd landed an airport or a space station because it was
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:51.040]  like a different planet you know and what it was Alex it was a glimpse of what could be and would be
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:56.080]  but for the suppression of information in the mainstream media because I was on the
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:02.800]  mainstream television with being interviewed by mainstream journalists that read read my staff
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:08.480]  and are aware of the information I was in the main Sunday newspaper two pages
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:13.840]  about the information in which the writer said having seen it put together I think I think it's
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:18.160]  right I think there is a global conspiracy I think this is happening mainstream journalist
[1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:22.880]  I was in their version of Time magazine called Glowers magazine again three pages about this
[1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:29.040]  information and and I was I was just everywhere and not because of me but because the information
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:35.840]  people are just I can't get enough of it because once people start to see the dots connected
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:43.680]  this apparently bewildering confused impossible to fathom the world makes total sense to make
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:51.920]  sense and but but you know I at the risk of being repetitive we really have those people
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:56.400]  who have woken up I've really now got to turn their minds to what are we going to do about it
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:01.040]  and they've got to realize those every day and they've got to realize every day what have we
[1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:08.960]  contributed today to bringing an end to this move this enormously quickening move now to this
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:14.080]  Orwellian state and what have we done to inform more people of what's going on because there's
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:19.840]  nothing nothing more important than this information because if we don't sort this out
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:27.680]  everything goes everything ends and we've really got to focus on what do we do rather than just
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:33.120]  learning more about it well I just want to repeat what you were saying but another way
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:39.040]  this is the time folks this is the window for the enemy and for humanity this is it and it's
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:43.760]  only going to intensify for the next decade and then that's going to decide the future destiny
[1:36:43.760 --> 1:36:50.720]  of humanity we are at the crossroads they try to use fake christianity to neutralize the majority
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:55.200]  of christians to think it's the you know there's nothing you can do the devil's coming don't warn
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:00.960]  anybody just wait to be raptured that is designed to make you set out they get the buddhist to set
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:05.360]  out thinking you know you know it's all the will of the singularity of the universe they you know
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:10.400]  all these mainline religions and i'm not attacking them i'm saying the what the new rulers done with
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:16.400]  them is turn them into excuses to lay there and lay down and take it you need to be active in you
[1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:22.480]  in you know in this one time to live in this key time that that that we are alive and what david
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:29.200]  ike is saying is absolutely true the power you have right now with blogs and emails and calling
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:33.760]  into shows and talking to people on the street and picketing and and and going to city council
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:39.040]  and saying no to the system and making little internet films or big internet films the power
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:43.120]  that you know so many well to do people who sat on the sidelines and said i'm going to see what
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:46.640]  happens i know you're right about this but i'm going to see what happens before we went to break
[1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:51.760]  david you brought up a key area people in the middle and upper strata of the new world order
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:55.840]  are going my god they really do plan to kill 80 percent or more my god they really are putting
[1:37:55.840 --> 1:38:00.320]  sodium fluoride in the water to brain damage people my god they really are and it's all coming
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:05.920]  out and and and so people are really starting to find out in the system what do they do what's
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:12.160]  your advice to not just the grass roots but but say a police captain i mean i thought this is
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:16.560]  this is this is a key area because um you've got the pyramid you've got the few at the top
[1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:20.800]  that were doing it in full awareness and then you've got the mess of the people in society at the
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:26.880]  bottom but between those points you've got this if you like middle management of the pyramid which
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:34.960]  is absolutely essential to installing the agenda that's dictated from above but doesn't have the
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:40.480]  full picture and often very little of the picture of of how the pieces fit and what they're actually
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:44.960]  contributing to and they have children and grandchildren who are going to have to live
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:51.920]  and face the consequences of them doing nothing and and so and i like i say in the last little
[1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:55.520]  while i've talked to some of these people and they've gone hold on a second i i think i've
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:01.600]  realized what i've been uh contributed to all this time now this is the level but if they start to
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:08.320]  rebel if they start to refuse if they start to question if they start my goodness me to speak
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:14.640]  out publicly and say i know this is happening as i'm in on the inside and i can tell you this if
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:20.560]  they start to do that then a massive spanner is thrown in the works because you're talking
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:26.960]  about a few people in full knowledge who are manipulating and they have to manipulate the
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:32.560]  population to manipulate and control each other and to imprison each other and if those people
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:39.040]  are those key levels of management if you like start to refuse to do that start to speak out
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:46.400]  stop in refuse to impose ludicrous laws that come straight out of nazi germany then the system
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:52.480]  can't function and if the people at the um a mainstream society who are not in those positions
[1:39:52.480 --> 1:40:00.480]  also start to get together on a mass campaign of civil disobedience and refusal to cooperate
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:06.480]  with their own enslavement then the whole thing starts to fall apart because there's a few of them
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:13.360]  and there's an enormous amount of us and we need to stop asking are you a christian are you a muslim
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:19.280]  i won't take you seriously if you're not at all this nonsense which is putting all of us in the
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:24.480]  same prison cell i tell you what when we're in a prison cell and the doors slam shut and there's
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:29.600]  guards all around let's have a debate about who's got the right religion shall we there's so many
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:35.120]  bait with our children whose very thoughts are being controlled by then about what religion they
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.040]  should follow or whether they should vote for this person or that person or whether this country is
[1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:45.280]  better than another let's start to grow up because if we don't this is the road we're going down but
[1:40:45.280 --> 1:40:51.680]  if we do it's a house of cards this whole thing it's a house of cards and who's holding it together
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:59.920]  we are we need to stop and when we do it'll fall but not unless we do well it is your capacity
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:04.320]  and others capacity to empathize that leads to greater knowledge people that only care about
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:08.560]  themselves think that they're winning or having some big victory as they covet something in the
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:12.960]  dark corner but empathizing when you start caring about other people and when you see
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:17.760]  their abuse as your abuse and when you see an iraqi child with their legs blown off
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:21.920]  and you empathize that could be my child and you start standing up against that crime
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:28.000]  it's that idea and that idea put into action that brings liberty and freedom it's the idea
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:32.320]  oh they're subhuman kill them that will bring death and destruction to your own children
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:37.760]  because if you let you go Alex I tell you one thing that would change this world overnight
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:43.520]  because of all that would come from it if everybody or vast numbers of people stop
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:51.280]  making decisions on situations they face every day on the basis of what's right for me and start
[1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:58.720]  to ask the question when they're making decisions on their action what is right if we do what is
[1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:05.520]  right then we stand up for the injustice against others even if we're not affected by it if we
[1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:09.840]  have a situation this is how how it works I hear people say well I'm not bothered about
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:15.520]  his freedom of speech but don't agree with him I mean if one person does not have the freedom to
[1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:23.200]  express their freely chosen uh a view then none of us do because everything else after one person
[1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:28.480]  loses that right is not the right to freedom of speech it's the right to conform within the limits
[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:36.000]  of what is acceptable to say so one person loses their freedom of expression we all lose it and
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:43.680]  one person is targeted by these fascists then we all need to stand with them whether we agree with
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:48.080]  them whether we like them whether a different religion a different color it doesn't matter
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:55.040]  we need to come together and absolutely these fault lines of divided rule because that's the
[1:42:55.040 --> 1:43:02.320]  way it's done and we stopped doing it that whole agenda comes under tremendous pressure
[1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:07.120]  because it can't function and it can't play out now David we've talked about the awakening people
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:10.720]  taking action a lot of solutions today we're going to have you back up the next month if you can do
[1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:14.800]  it to get more into that and some of your new books and videos that are out available at
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:22.000]  davidike.com but I wanted to spend some time on the enemy's agenda and their program they're having
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:28.400]  a meeting in Europe in in Brussels today with the Chinese government's proposal uh this is in
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:35.600]  the Associated Press and on the UN's website and with the NSA to decide on a global standard
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:40.960]  how to enforce internet ID where you're tracked and traced and so they can turn your internet ID
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:45.280]  off if they don't like the poster making so a universal ban because now if they restrict
[1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:49.200]  YouTube or Google or something people just move to other sites and those become popular
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:53.280]  they want to be able to universally ban and control they openly say they're bringing internet to and
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:59.440]  blocking most IPs and blocking most websites there's hundreds of ways they're attacking
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:05.520]  Comcast, Time Warner you know blocking in many cities now in many systems down to just a few
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:09.680]  thousand sites you can visit from billions I mean it's happening it's not in the realm of
[1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:17.280]  gonna come you know might happen it it's now here they they are moving they YouTube is implementing
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:22.880]  uh the bill that hasn't even passed the senate yet to restrict anything basically criticizing
[1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:27.840]  the government 9-11 truth has been listed as as to be banned on the web I mean you can't make this
[1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:33.120]  up it's in the bill they showed 9-11 truth next to al-qaeda in congress in videos they showed
[1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:38.320]  uh architects and engineers from 9-11 truth they're so scared of those scholars uh how do we
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:44.320]  protest and demonstrate and and and and boycott uh Time Warner cable even if people say well
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:50.080]  they're not blocking IPs yet or blocking webs addresses in austin or dallas it's only in areas
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:56.640]  of south texas or areas of canada they're beta testing you you you boycott them all now and let
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:02.400]  them know you're doing it because of this uh you educate the public you explain that I mean I mean
[1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:08.400]  what are your ideas to save the internet well exactly but the one thing we can do is is when
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:15.200]  these people impose these things we we we just move away from them because um what you're describing
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:20.000]  is what we have in britain um when the government says we're having a trial and when the government
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:24.800]  says we're having a trial you know actually this is what's coming next for everybody um they have
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:30.960]  trials of of of all different things to do with this all well in agenda or it's just a trial
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:37.680]  and we've had a trial recently um in in terms of um uh tracking car speeds over a period of many
[1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:41.840]  many miles instead of on one camera as you pass it and let me stop you if the trial was going to
[1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:46.800]  become uh uh universally uh introduced and that's what they've now announced they're going to do
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:52.640]  david so david it's at the point of the trial we need to jump in and and uh and and start
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:57.520]  resisting it not when the whole thing's a fate of complete well I mean I was about to say every
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:01.920]  you know what it's corporate propaganda because everything is phrased like it's no big deal it's
[1:46:01.920 --> 1:46:05.520]  just a trial doesn't affect anyone don't worry and then a year later everybody's got to do it
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:10.400]  remember it was just a trial five years ago with transponders taxing people in London now
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:16.160]  they're doing it and taxing you at you know five six pounds per way oh it's just a trial
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:21.680]  to make people take satellite systems in their cars that remote control them and call the police
[1:46:21.680 --> 1:46:26.320]  when you speed and now england wants to make it the law drivers could have speed limit by
[1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:31.760]  satellite devices it was just a trial in five us airports to have scanners that look through your
[1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:37.440]  clothes and record your neck and body now it's going in 200 all the big 214 all the major airports
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:41.840]  and now they announced yesterday they're going to put it on the streets of america looking through
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:48.160]  your clothes i mean my god it's just a trial david yeah it's just a trial this is this is
[1:46:48.160 --> 1:46:52.400]  what i call the totalitarian tiptoe although it's not even the totalitarian tiptoe anymore it's a
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:57.840]  totalitarian sprint uh this this is coming in so fast and and this is another point that i would
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:03.360]  say to people i did make the point last time we talked you know people need to open their minds
[1:47:03.360 --> 1:47:09.760]  to to uh the bigger picture of what's behind this too because when you look at the the scale
[1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:14.880]  the interconnected detail of all these different aspects of society and life and
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:23.760]  emotion and and and and and mind and all of it is being brought into this you know it's not a group
[1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:30.000]  of dark-suited men sitting around a table working this out there is a vast vast conspiracy behind
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:37.680]  this um which is um is is coordinating it all and and and george borschen barak obama and
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:43.280]  gordon brown are light years uh down the pyramid from the level it's coming out of and the scale of
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:50.240]  technological advancement that that is behind it and we need to open our minds to the fact that
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:55.280]  you know this is above governments and it's above the people we see in the public arena
[1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:00.560]  uh we've got to get really in the shadows before we can ever understand what the the force is behind
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:04.800]  this that plays out through these people but doesn't originate with them well we know the
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:10.240]  tax-free foundations and congressional hearings design have think tanks for every little ass
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:15.520]  aspect then they have these literal statistical and organizational geniuses who put it all together
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:21.200]  but you're right then when you look at it uh then you find out they're all a cultist at the highest
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:25.440]  level of the pyramid they're all into blood sacrifice and we're not making this up folks
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:29.920]  this is mainstream it comes out here in there ritchard nixon talked about the homosexual
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:36.160]  orgies of bohemian grove that's on tape harper's magazine i mean there's a level at the top they
[1:48:36.160 --> 1:48:40.560]  believe they are communicating with entities and that's where me and david i mean david's
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:45.520]  deep deep around the rabbit hole i just go with what i can prove uh but uh but but but bottom line
[1:48:45.520 --> 1:48:50.320]  david ike on one side the good guy side and then the bad guys on the other dark side
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:57.200]  they all believe they are under the control of entities yeah and you know i was talking earlier
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:03.040]  today about the Rothschilds that their name used to be called bower and the the the the bower family
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:10.320]  in uh in europe was a notorious what they call a cult family it was deeply into the uh
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:15.920]  black magic arts and uh of course the black magic is just the uh negative use of knowledge
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:22.240]  of how energy and consciousness works and and and these people are really uh behind their uh
[1:49:22.240 --> 1:49:27.600]  their banking front and their dark suit and tie front these people are deep black magicians who
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:33.040]  have in effect cast the spell on the human collective mind and that's why we talk about
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:38.400]  people need to wake up and by the way up from from that trend look at all the look at all the
[1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:44.080]  hollywood people with cabala all over them and then we always said at 10 15 years ago that madonna's
[1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:49.200]  uh rock concerts were rituals and then she came out two years ago and said yes they've always been
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:56.240]  these are these are black magic rituals basically uh and and yeah yeah the thing is um we've got a
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:02.800]  conscious mind um which we obviously are consciously aware of all the time um and we've got a subconscious
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:08.640]  mind that we're not consciously aware of by definition and these are black magic arts and rituals
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:13.840]  they don't have a program to the subconscious mind that's that's their aim and it's programming
[1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:20.720]  eventually as as it filters through the conscious mind's perception of reality and and and and you
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:28.640]  know all these structures like uh religion and uh and and all these uh institutions of belief and
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:36.080]  all these rigid belief systems that people have they're all part of this um imposition of um a wall
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:41.840]  around our sense of possibility and our sense of um what what's happening and and the nature of
[1:50:41.840 --> 1:50:50.160]  life itself okay and if you can put someone in a in a mind prison called rigid unyielding belief
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:55.440]  david stay there stay there off we gotta break off hey david part of them themselves david you're
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:51:00.400]  on a cell phone aren't you no okay just when i talk i don't think you can hear me we had to go to
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:04.880]  break but we're still live on the internet so so so finish your thought i just had to cut you off so
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:09.200]  you can continue but before you finish up with putting them in that rigid control system looking
[1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:14.640]  at the world you know through a straw so you can hardly see any of it while it's all and keep you so
[1:51:14.640 --> 1:51:19.280]  close to the problem you're like what is this in front of me i can't tell but you take that off and
[1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:23.760]  pull back oh it's a microphone uh there it is now i can oh my gosh there's a computer right here

[1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:23.280]  david okay thank well we're going to be back in about 20 seconds and then just finish up your
[1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:28.800]  thoughts so it's congruent uh and i appreciate uh everybody out there uh who's watching on prison
[1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:32.560]  planet dot tv get all the behind the scenes discussions you know this is total transparency
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:37.760]  now on the show literal reality tv because you're seeing behind the scenes you're seeing what we do
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:42.960]  what goes on hey john let's come in with the bugs life again just bring music fade it down
[1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:50.720]  play the bugs life one more time here we go okay do it now or become property of the new world order
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:54:00.800]  you let one and stand up to us then they all might stand up those puny little ants outnumber us a
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:15.600]  hundred to one your own personal jesus he did a great talk at oxford that i've seen really
[1:54:15.600 --> 1:54:22.640]  shot beautifully excellent presentation at that dvd at davidike.com just came out uh really interesting
[1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:26.480]  information very thought provoking that's what matters getting you outside the box and then
[1:54:26.480 --> 1:54:32.400]  outside the other box the outside the next box you're in uh david finishing up you were bringing
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:40.000]  up uh before we went to that break uh getting people to to to to take the blinders off literally
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:43.600]  and and just open their minds up and what that does continue
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:51.360]  ancient greek philosopher socrates is uh quoted as saying uh wisdom is knowing how little we know
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:57.120]  and um i always work with that because you know in the vastness of forever um all possibility
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:06.480]  exists and if we shut our minds uh from that by rigid beliefs that um uh construct a limitation
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:12.320]  of what's possible then um we're operating on a fraction of of our own potential and also a
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:17.200]  fraction of the knowledge and awareness that's available of who we are and the nature of what
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:22.560]  we're experiencing so it doesn't mean that that you open your mind and and you say i'll believe
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:28.240]  anything it's quite not that at all but it's it's opening to the possibility instead of a reflex
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:34.240]  action no i'm not going there that can't be true because it's against my belief system and there's
[1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:41.520]  this um psychological state which which explains so much about behavior which is called cognitive
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:51.680]  dissonance and it's a it's a stress state and an unease state that people go in when their belief
[1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:57.040]  and their experience or information they come across are contradicting each other now what
[1:55:57.680 --> 1:56:03.280]  the few people do is they look at the information and the experience and they say hold on a second
[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:08.880]  i've got to have another look at my belief here because in the light of what i'm i'm experiencing
[1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:14.880]  and seeing and that is great because cognitive dissonance then you it's about bringing the
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:19.840]  the contradictions together into a whole then you can move forward and your belief changes
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:24.560]  in the light of new information but what what most people do when they go into this cognitive
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:32.160]  dissonance state is that their prime motive is to preserve the belief system that's right in fact
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:37.920]  in fact they have invested like like bill hickson i've put a lot into this ride don't you tell me
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:44.640]  it doesn't matter exactly that and and and what um what they then do and i you see this all the
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:52.080]  time if they then concoct stories they lie to themselves to bring together an explanation
[1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:57.280]  of of what they're experiencing and seeing and learning um to keep make sure the belief system
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:02.320]  is retained their delusion that's when you get things like oh no we've got to go to war to bring
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:07.920]  peace or um oh no um we've got to have some of our freedoms that are taken away so that we can
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:13.840]  protect our liberties this is cognitive dissonance lying to itself or causing people to lie to
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:19.520]  themselves to protect tech the belief system have you ever these systems need need just to not
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:24.880]  control us anymore let's look at the evidence let's look at what we're seeing and let's come to
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:30.560]  conclusions based on that not preconceived idea that the priest told us or the politician told us
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:36.720]  or the guy at the college told us have you ever seen my film terror storm sorry i was my friends
[1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:42.800]  gone fun i didn't hear that did you ever see my film terror storm because you know you still jump
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:57:47.520]  in a row okay go to see what's wrong with the line here okay can you hear me david
[1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:53.600]  no i'm i'm losing about every other word i don't know what suddenly made that happen
[1:57:53.600 --> 1:57:59.200]  okay uh well who knows you know okay you know you can you know you can hear me up yeah have you
[1:57:59.200 --> 1:58:04.960]  ever seen my film terror storm uh i've looked looked looked at it a little bit yeah okay well
[1:58:04.960 --> 1:58:10.560]  i mean there's the part where the woman uh at the uh fruit shop outside says i want to give up my
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:15.360]  liberty for freedom and i said but liberty and freedom are the same things she's like no they're
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:21.520]  not so uh let me talk about double think i won't give up my liberty for freedom uh david ike in
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:27.520]  the final five minutes segment with him then bob Chapman detailed analysis of the engineered
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:34.000]  economic implosion that is happening stay with us all right i'm going to skip this break too
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:37.520]  this is one minute david we're going to come back in one minute we'll have five minutes left and
[1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:45.120]  i've got you set for the 6th of october uh at 118 to one yes 11 to one 11 that's great 11 to one

[1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:03.840]  be an hour and a half of live airtime so you are the best i'd like to look at look at reality and
[1:59:03.840 --> 1:59:10.080]  how we uh create it and how we interact with it because these guys know that and they could have

[2:00:55.920 --> 2:01:00.800]  out they're open about world government open about the north american union uh... suddenly i'm
[2:01:00.800 --> 2:01:06.800]  seeing roth child's all over tv's the the wife of a baron roth child was on cnn last night
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:13.200]  acting completely wicked i mean the woman just radiated evil uh pushing john mccain uh we've
[2:01:13.200 --> 2:01:20.880]  got uh as if it mattered uh we've got uh major articles here where the the militaries come out
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:26.640]  and said yes regular army will patrol america period and even do police work now into posse
[2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:31.360]  common taught us in the army times and then we have the pope saying ufo's are real aliens are
[2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:35.280]  real all these governments saying they're real they have astronauts coming out and saying and i
[2:01:35.280 --> 2:01:40.480]  never covered that i mean what is all this part of why are they coming out we got three minutes
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:47.760]  uh... i mean uh... the bottom line is you know when you when you when you look at uh
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:51.760]  this this reality uh... there's no way that humans are the only uh...
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:58.320]  uh... form of so-called intelligent life um there are obviously are other forms of life um
[2:01:59.040 --> 2:02:05.360]  that we call extraterrestrials um around this uh this universe however um there is a
[2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:13.280]  very clear plan it would seem to me to use um the threat of some kind of extraterrestrial
[2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:20.480]  invasion or extraterrestrial uh manipulation to justify all the things that they um they want
[2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:26.480]  to introduce i mean you you're talking about um a world army we must come together to meet this
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:31.520]  threat we must come together financially we must drop borders we must have a like a war cabinet
[2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:38.800]  if you like all these things become um open to justification once you can sell the idea of a
[2:02:38.800 --> 2:02:43.600]  threat from beyond now i'm not saying it's going to happen but um it's certainly one of the things
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:49.040]  that i've picked up over the years that has been in the planning ready to be uh to be played and
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:54.720]  it is interesting to me uh what you said there though because i've noticed it too how um over the
[2:02:54.720 --> 2:03:02.480]  years through the nineties any idea of um uh UFOs extraterrestrial uh uh presence was just
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:07.760]  dismissed by the authorities by reflex action all of them it's a nonsense there's no evidence
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:13.760]  now suddenly there's been a big big sea change in the way that they're treating this information
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:19.040]  and the way they're dealing with it i think we have to be very very careful if it comes along
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:24.160]  that uh yes we're we're under the threat of some extraterrestrial invasion because we need to
[2:03:24.160 --> 2:03:28.960]  look at that very closely well i agree i was watching a mainline pbs special about uh
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:34.240]  meteorites hitting the earth and hitting saturn jupiter and in that show to you in conference
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:39.360]  with russians in the u.s and others saying we could use a threat of an asteroid to unify
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:44.560]  things for world government and they said or that plan for extraterrestrials so stuff like that leaks
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:50.320]  out and we know about bluebeam and other plans to make a fake holograms that's admitted and then
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:56.800]  suddenly it looks like they may be getting ready of the financial 9 11 uh the physical 9 11 will
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:04.480]  there be an et 9 11 who knows well it's a sudden certainly a possibility uh because we're now in
[2:04:04.480 --> 2:04:10.480]  um uh compared with the lives that people have led in the world up to this point we are in fantasy
[2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:17.840]  land now we're we're in a realm in a period where anything is possible um and and all bets are off
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:22.480]  and we should not be surprised at anything that comes along what we need to do is not take it on
[2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:28.400]  face value that's right whatever it is but to look at it is passionately before we start to
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:32.240]  uh that's right decisions on it that's right they're blurring the lines of reality on purpose
[2:04:32.240 --> 2:04:36.480]  because they know we're exposing their false reality they just want to smoke screen at all
[2:04:36.480 --> 2:04:40.720]  like a squid with ink so nobody knows what's going on but we're going to shine a light through that
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:48.000]  david ike i will talk to you coming up uh in about a month from now on october 6 thank you so much

[2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:12.960]  okay bob Chapman joined us for about 40 minutes today
[2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:18.880]  and we've got april gallup who was a survivor in the pentagon really suspicious things that
[2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:26.960]  happened there uh bomb uh dr paul craig roberts yourself uh joseph sticklets everybody we've
[2:08:26.960 --> 2:08:33.120]  had on this show the new york business school wonk they've all said that we could have a depression
[2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:38.400]  at any time with what's happening in the last few years but it would probably happen in 2009
[2:08:38.400 --> 2:08:44.800]  2010 and we'll continue on out from there uh it looks like things are worsening uh quicker than
[2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:49.680]  we thought uh you know on one hand i have all the imf and world bank documents where they admit
[2:08:49.680 --> 2:08:55.760]  they want to implode economies they want bailouts uh they uh need to create a new financial order
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:00.880]  by collapsing the old one to bring in a world currency uh we know they're doing all of that we
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:05.440]  know that the real scam now is the bailouts hundreds of billions a day leverage into the
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:10.400]  trillions because these are all leveraged 70 100 200 times i see different numbers in the press
[2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:15.440]  probably far worse than that so i want to get into what the full exposure is where the steepening
[2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:22.320]  crisis is going gold exploding last time i checked it was up like 100 bucks from two days ago uh
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:28.560]  they say the biggest one-time rise for gold ever uh all of this happening on the heels of them driving
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:34.480]  down uh oil and gold and uh and and other commodities jacking up the dollar now the dollar
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:39.120]  plunging uh where bob Chapman thinks all of this is going and for those that don't know who he is
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:42.960]  he is the international forecaster dot com to have one of the biggest the biggest newsletters in
[2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:47.760]  the world one of the biggest gold silver brokers ever uh worked in military intelligence before
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:55.200]  that uh and has been spot on with his analysis uh so uh i mean bob we know this is contrived
[2:09:55.200 --> 2:10:00.800]  but uh you and a few others say well they did want to contrive this but now they've lost control
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:05.680]  which i don't know what's more you know which is uh scarier bob Chapman thanks for coming on
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:12.480]  well thanks for having me again and uh it's all scary because it's all gonna end up in the same
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:17.840]  place sooner or later and it's not gonna be nice uh as far as gold is concerned yesterday it was up
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:24.800]  in the outside market uh 87 dollars and 30 cents and it was higher earlier and in today it's trading
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:32.960]  up around 50 dollars and it it you know we said in the forecaster that we felt once gold bottomed
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:41.280]  it's 775 approximately that uh it would be the fourth test of that area and when it went up it
[2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:48.560]  would go up in a straight line quickly and we've been proven to be correct again and one of the
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:55.120]  things that the chart is submitting is that there's an inverse a reverse head and shoulders patent
[2:10:55.840 --> 2:11:02.640]  and uh not to get into any detail uh it's very bullish and uh we could go straight right up
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:09.760]  it's trading around 900 dollars right now yeah it's uh 895 dollars and 60 cents it's spot up 32
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:19.200]  70 today after going up around 80 dollars yesterday so what's 32 and 80 uh but over 112 dollars
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:25.360]  in less than 24 hours and it just shows you that the market was manipulated and they couldn't
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:31.600]  continue to control it and we had predicted that and that's what happened now what i see in there
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:38.080]  right now is i see the commercials are starting to do some shorting and essentially for all
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:44.480]  intensive purposes even though the contracts out on the short side are about 95 000 that's normal
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:49.520]  and so they're looking for places to short hey bob bob dumb it down because i study this all the
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:53.920]  time and i barely follow you i mean dumb it down for people explain what's going on and and then
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:59.840]  give us the gold perspective then let's get into the wider economy you know the the the real economy
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:05.680]  versus the banking economy and and and and if you're changing your prognosis from the country
[2:12:05.680 --> 2:12:12.800]  will be dead from cancer in two years financially or will it be dead in six months well uh dumbing
[2:12:12.800 --> 2:12:18.560]  it down uh when you short a stock or short a metal or short anything you're betting it's
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:24.800]  going to go down and professionals are always on the opposite side of the market uh the public
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:30.240]  goes on the long side and they buy something hoping it's going to go up the the professionals
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:36.640]  their mindset is to figure out when they should bet that it's going to go down and i see them
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:42.880]  in doing a little betting in here that it's going to go down and uh and i see shorting and that's
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:49.120]  natural and that's okay because they were short before and when gold went down they came in and
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:55.920]  bought their shorts back in and when they did that they stabilized gold which turned out very well
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:13:02.400]  for people who were long gold because it stopped the correction and anyway we're headed up uh i'm
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:07.920]  sure that the government's going to try to step in again to stop gold and silver platinum palladium
[2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:14.480]  uh from moving higher i'm sure they're trying to keep oil down this morning uh at 330 oil was
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:20.480]  up 240 now it's down 70 cents and so then they're in the markets working all the time and it's very
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:27.280]  difficult uh to make good decisions except on a long-term basis so where's gold gold and silver
[2:13:27.280 --> 2:13:35.440]  and going they're going higher uh as far as uh what's going to happen as far as the timing
[2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:40.480]  on things getting much worse than they are already and they're all bad now uh again
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:47.840]  everything everything takes more time than people think and uh i'm still looking out two and a half
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:55.760]  years or so and uh they would have to be something extraordinary that would happen to change that
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:05.360]  and what could that be um perhaps some event that nobody had expected within the financial
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:15.360]  sphere to happen and then it would send everything awry and then send the financial part of our system
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:23.120]  down and uh and that would bring on depression and probably a lot of other things and so uh
[2:14:23.120 --> 2:14:29.440]  in the absence of that uh we have to deal with what we can generally see in the future
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:37.200]  and uh and so i expect that that's what that will be the time frame uh what's going on now as you
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:46.320]  pointed out uh before on the program is that uh we have uh the united states government not to
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:53.840]  do treasury and the fed reserve privately owned uh which acting as conduits to keep to keep the
[2:14:53.840 --> 2:15:01.920]  entire economy from collapsing that's really the bottom line on it and uh the feds in the repo market
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:07.040]  injecting in a two-day period a hundred and twenty billion dollars uh they got other central banks
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:13.440]  doing the same thing uh that aggregates uh something like a hundred sixty billion dollars
[2:15:13.440 --> 2:15:19.600]  we still have the uh the discount window open to the banks we don't know what they're doing right
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:25.600]  now because everything is a secret and then we have the auctions they're running two hundred
[2:15:25.600 --> 2:15:34.720]  billion dollars plus a month and and then we have on top of that the repo market uh the uh m3 as it
[2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:40.880]  used to be called is probably running somewhere between 14 and 15 percent right now inflation
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:49.600]  is still sticking at 13 and 5 8 percent long-term unemployment's 14 and 7 8 percent uh all the
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:56.880]  indicators are towards the generative process within the economic structure not only the united
[2:15:56.880 --> 2:16:08.240]  states but the world the generation of the financial system as well and continued interference by
[2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:14.560]  government and central banks in that process which is going to cause horrendous inflation
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:23.520]  and that's why we see gold exploding it really should be up at around 3000 now for the amount
[2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:28.640]  of money and liquidity they've issued we're dealing with conservatively hundreds of trillions
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:34.560]  leveraged into god knows what thousands of trillions uh we've got uh fanny man freddy mac
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:39.200]  50 something trillion uh saying five trillion of its and you know big trouble but then we know
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:45.920]  that's been sold in securities over and over again and leveraged over and over again and they bought
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:52.160]  up most of the real assets uh by doing this and now they're positioning themselves for the imf
[2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:59.120]  world bank riot as they call it the breakdown of the economy north com has announced that they
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:03.760]  will have regular army patrolling the streets of america just randomly wherever they want
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:10.560]  they're training multiple brigades for this uh it's just they're pulling out all the stops bob
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:15.440]  and and and then paulson was in bloomberg on bloomberg tv and and i've got the article right here
[2:17:16.800 --> 2:17:22.880]  and said congress a few congressmen said hey well don't we get say and hundreds of billions a day
[2:17:22.880 --> 2:17:28.160]  being being given to these banks brokerage firms in in paulson said no it's a contract
[2:17:28.160 --> 2:17:32.400]  and you're not involved the executive runs this and the fellow reserve runs this which is private
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:38.000]  uh and and congress you know what they sat down and they shut up i mean for anybody that knows
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:41.760]  the bill of rights constitution declaration of independence anybody that knows congress does
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:49.920]  the funding that's their authority uh i mean to see pdd 51 bob implemented uh in monetary policy
[2:17:49.920 --> 2:17:54.320]  which is what it says in there it's just for economic or any other crisis my god i mean this
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:17:59.200]  is open dictatorship by the banking elite and now they're rolling the ponzi scheme into the next
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:04.560]  level saying the new thing will be a world carbon tax regionally and locally on us distributed and
[2:18:04.560 --> 2:18:09.600]  controlled internationally uh the g and you know the different geopolitical sectors feeding back
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:15.040]  into the global corporate structure that nests in every capital i mean this is just hellish
[2:18:15.040 --> 2:18:18.880]  looting that's going on and i guess the only place where we've somewhat disagree is you're
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:24.720]  saying they've lost control my this looks like a controlled uh feeding frenzy i mean two sharks
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:29.920]  skin and feeding frenzies and bite each other and do you know attack smaller sharks yes but
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:34.960]  uh i mean i mean you you've said this thing was engineered in the past uh i mean why are you
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:39.520]  saying it's it's well i mean first comment on the pulsing situation just saying you know what
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:45.760]  congress sit down and shut up and they did yeah well that's because they're paid off most of them
[2:18:45.760 --> 2:18:51.840]  and they do that through campaign contributions and other things and uh that's why i continue to
[2:18:51.840 --> 2:18:56.960]  say clear congress except for warrant ron paul they get rid of them and and start over again
[2:18:57.600 --> 2:19:01.440]  because if you don't you're going to have the same problem and we're going to lose lose lose
[2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:07.440]  and yes that's what paulson is telling congress you know sit down and shut up and but that's
[2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:15.760]  been going on for some time uh but more blatantly lately uh lately within the last year or two
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:23.520]  because things are getting far more difficult and uh within the economic and financial spheres uh
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:27.760]  in fact i have quotes here from the leader of the house in the senate and they're saying
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:31.120]  we don't even know what's going on i'll read the quotes after we come back from break
[2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:36.800]  we don't even know what's going on we don't even understand uh uh what you know we don't
[2:19:36.800 --> 2:19:42.000]  know what to do we'll just do whatever you say i mean just totally compliant will whatever the
[2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:46.960]  private bankers say you run everything now this is all contrived this is engineered this implosion
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:51.920]  just like the Rothschild did in 1815 is being engineered let's skip the break for info wars
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:58.400]  dot com uh i mean bob flesh that out why are you saying they've lost control i mean i know they're
[2:19:58.400 --> 2:20:04.640]  saying that but i mean you see a lot of control here and and and and vertical integration massive
[2:20:04.640 --> 2:20:10.480]  consolidation now the international structure right now uh i believe by design and a lot of
[2:20:10.480 --> 2:20:14.800]  others believe by design uh even sticklet says they've done this by design in other cases he
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:20.160]  doesn't know if this is by design he's been out of the imf world bank for seven years i mean what
[2:20:20.160 --> 2:20:28.720]  say you ye on that well i think it's controlled chaos but only controlled to a degree at this time
[2:20:29.440 --> 2:20:36.400]  what it'll evolve in eventually is collapse now the question is can they control the people of
[2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:41.600]  the world during the collapse period and that's why they're doing what they're doing with uh
[2:20:41.600 --> 2:20:49.200]  northern command and and bringing troops in and things like that um they think that they can control
[2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:56.560]  it by using american perhaps even other forces and that is their goal because what they've been
[2:20:56.560 --> 2:21:04.560]  trying to do is a mess and they're trying to do the best they can to control the collapse
[2:21:04.560 --> 2:21:10.320]  and that's why it looks like it's working the way you just described for them and in other
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:15.360]  words the consolidation is working and they're doing what they can but in the end it's still gonna
[2:21:15.360 --> 2:21:23.600]  collapse and then i guess we'll be a banana republic ruled by north com exactly unless the
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:30.160]  people use the 450 million weapons that they've got in america and say look we don't want that in
[2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:34.640]  that the proof troops do not lay down their weapons we're gonna kill them all well the declaration
[2:21:34.640 --> 2:21:39.040]  of independence says it's not only our right it's our sacred duty but through cognitive dissonance
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:43.200]  people think it's it's it's it's i mean they say do whatever let them take your children
[2:21:43.200 --> 2:21:48.960]  go to fema camps line up in ditches there is no moral right to resist any action of criminal
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:53.280]  government and now it's not even government the federal reserve openly just says sit down i mean
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:59.920]  i got the quotes here sit down shut up and it's now like you said you might be right they might
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:05.680]  have lost control because it really is reaching a lala land proportion and then now they're recalling
[2:22:05.680 --> 2:22:10.960]  brigades from iraq which we knew they were gearing up for but i mean see well how did they know the
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:16.240]  eventuality of the collapse of the economy then to have troops for that as they say they say for
[2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:21.120]  economic collapse and dealing with americans and and it says you know they hope they won't have to
[2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:26.400]  shoot us that's in the army times we hope we mean they're now the army times is saying we hope we
[2:22:26.400 --> 2:22:31.120]  don't have to shoot you i mean they're really i guess because they have to be brazen and out in
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:35.680]  the open so the troops go well it's in the army times i mean you know i guess well there's a flip
[2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:40.640]  title that there's the flip side to that i hope we don't get killed in the process because they get
[2:22:40.640 --> 2:22:48.000]  more weapons than we have i mean we could feel 35 million adults i mean how many are they gonna
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:55.840]  feel 500 000 well i mean i just can't but i mean literally the us army is now invading the united
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:23:02.960]  states and ahead of economic collapse god help us look what these bastards have done bob i just
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:08.080]  can't believe it i mean i mean we've been knowing either video even as long as i've been associated
[2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:14.160]  i i didn't think it would get this far and it has well we'll come back and talk about that
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:21.840]  because that's what blows my mind uh is that is that you even if you consciously intellectually
[2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:27.440]  coldly analyze the facts and then this answer pops out of total tyranny martial law they state
[2:23:27.440 --> 2:23:31.760]  that it's not our opinion it's not even our analysis they're they just say it to see it
[2:23:32.320 --> 2:23:39.520]  unfolding to see them doing it to to to understand that that they're just going from broke
[2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:42.640]  and they got a bunch of roi head idiots that are going to follow them right to hell
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:48.240]  and i i just can't believe it god help us okay bob here we go i want i want you to speak about
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:54.240]  that here we go today
[2:23:57.600 --> 2:24:01.360]  yeah we've known this was coming for a long time that it's all public government documents
[2:24:01.360 --> 2:24:06.080]  declassified martial law tyranny breaking up families forced inoculations people living in
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:12.480]  communal uh skyscrapers under police control that's the plan one child policies that's the
[2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:16.880]  bare minimum and they wanted to have economic implosion but bob is saying and many other
[2:24:16.880 --> 2:24:21.600]  analysts say he got out of control the the pyramid ponzi thing they built in the crooks they hired
[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:26.000]  to run it the kind of mid-level managers even got out of control and so now the whole thing is
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:30.720]  in jeopardy which is even more dangerous in a way uh but it shows they're not invincible and
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:35.120]  maybe you're right bob but regardless we know what the final outcome is north com coming out and
[2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:40.000]  announcing they're gonna field troops against the american people for insurrection ahead of it they
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:47.120]  know what they're doing is so bad people are gonna resist uh just god help us you traders uh bob what
[2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:50.800]  do you say to the military what do you say to the police what do you say to everybody about this
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:54.720]  it's not like we just started this week saying this we've been saying this for decades and now
[2:24:54.720 --> 2:25:00.000]  it's all happening well i think as far as the police are concerned i i think they have to be
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:04.560]  informed that they really don't want to be on the other side because they don't stand a chance
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:09.680]  and even if they moved to half a million troops out of iraq which they don't have there or from
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:15.200]  other places in the world into the united states they wouldn't stand a chance i mean you can easily
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:21.760]  arm which are the people have already got the weapons 45 million male adults in america i mean
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:27.840]  sure the kill ratio might be great but they do the other guys can't win so the military has got
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:35.360]  to think about all being exterminated but just by numbers i mean even with a 20 to 1 kill ratio
[2:25:35.360 --> 2:25:40.960]  they still can't win and a lot of these people who have weapons in america are veterans and i'm
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:46.560]  one of them you know i'm a crack shot i can make kills of a thousand yards well let's boil it down
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:51.920]  let's say 1 percent of a hundred million gun owners we know it's higher than that but a hundred million
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:55.520]  because when polars call people a lot of folks won't say they have a gun because they're smart
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:26:02.320]  they're smart um if we have one percent of a million fight back that's a million combatants
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:06.160]  and i don't even want this folks i mean they're saying they're going to use
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:10.720]  mexican and canadian troops it was public a decade ago but they signed the deal last year
[2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:19.040]  in canada no in january of 2008 nine months ago and congress a few congressmen said well you
[2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:23.680]  did not authorize by congress and i mean usually they had to commission an officer folks congress
[2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:28.560]  used to be in control so the president couldn't be a dictator and they just said you know what we'll
[2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:33.680]  use canadian and mexican troops for insurrection in the u.s during any emergency including economic
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:40.160]  and that's it shut up and now polson tells congress shut up i mean this is open they are
[2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:46.080]  insurrecting against our republic i want to make that clear this is illegal what you're doing to
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:54.000]  take them out bob you never used to talk like this and i mean as a veteran as somebody who fought
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:58.320]  against the russians and in intelligence operations what do you think the other people in government
[2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:02.960]  are saying are they just total ne'er-do-wells well i think they're as terrified as we are
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:08.560]  we wouldn't be talking this way if we weren't really terrified about the ramifications of this
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:15.680]  and i do programs that are devoted uh directly to military people and we discuss this all the
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:22.800]  time on these programs and i tell them and and i said i say spilt spread the word these men are
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:30.000]  all over the world you do not want to attack the american public that is that is an order if you're
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:37.840]  given that order that order is illegal and you you have to challenge it i mean we we saw the
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:44.240]  nirnberg war crimes trials and the excuse was well you know if we didn't do it they shoot us well
[2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:51.360]  you're not supposed to do it and so the military knows what's going on and they're very very concerned
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:57.600]  because they don't want to get involved in that they did a defend america uh not to police americans
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:05.920]  or shoot them and the good people and uh i don't know what this is going to come to but i do know
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:12.320]  this if it comes to that the people will win they'll pay a terrible price well i'll tell you what's
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:16.960]  going to happen mom government will be wiped out yeah i want you to get more into what this will
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:22.320]  come to in a moment and back in the gold and the final segment coming up but right now the problem
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:28.560]  is they will have provocateurs who they allow to escape attack military groups on video to then
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:34.800]  demonize anyone resisting the troops they're also training like you do with dog training we train a
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:42.080]  dog to attack on dummies and they're saying they're going to fight crime fight tear fight rioters
[2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:47.760]  and help with the jaws of life get people out of cars and it says they're just going to show up in
[2:28:47.760 --> 2:28:52.160]  the military is going to do it as kind of a pr thing so they're going to phase this in with
[2:28:52.160 --> 2:28:57.840]  scyop but i still don't think that's going to work bob but i mean you get the angle i'm going with
[2:28:57.840 --> 2:29:04.640]  here yes i do and one of the reasons it's not going to work is because of your program and programs
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:11.200]  like yours that are discussing this in the air both sides of the situation why we don't want it to
[2:29:11.200 --> 2:29:18.080]  happen but why it probably are might happen and what to do under those circumstances this is what
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:24.560]  democracy is about you're not going to get it of course on the on the major media but by just by
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:31.200]  the fact that we're discussing this is extraordinarily important well the government and the criminals
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:37.120]  running it are not invincible and these mercenaries are going to turn and run and yes folks it's a
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:42.800]  serious probability this is going to happen we're going to skip to segment two okay bob i'm going to
[2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:48.480]  keep you till about 40 after uh right now continue getting into what i interrupted there uh with
[2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:52.800]  what you're saying you know how this will unfold if it does go into a shooting war
[2:29:52.800 --> 2:30:00.160]  that some of the different scenarios well it's been a long time since i was in the military
[2:30:00.160 --> 2:30:07.280]  but i i you know you'll you'll have a false flag sort of thing and like you said uh
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:13.520]  they will they will perform attacks on troops and things like that but i think perhaps because
[2:30:13.520 --> 2:30:19.680]  there's so much going on i think we got a slide back into the economy i i think that the people
[2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:27.520]  have heard enough here about those sort of things we know we've discussed them before okay well
[2:30:27.520 --> 2:30:33.600]  well if we've got three of the big five banks brokerage firms going under we've got hundreds of
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:39.360]  billions a day being pumped in uh with interest on the american people's backs trillions total
[2:30:40.480 --> 2:30:46.160]  we have all of this stuff unfolding uh then let's talk about i mean you're saying two three years
[2:30:46.160 --> 2:30:50.560]  so this really goes into depression are you saying a depression's a hundred percent now
[2:30:50.560 --> 2:30:59.760]  in all probability it is a hundred percent uh it was guess and and uh and projection uh
[2:31:00.400 --> 2:31:05.840]  you know based upon what we saw fundamentally economically and financially as well i mean
[2:31:05.840 --> 2:31:11.600]  is this not worsening i mean i mean from your from your projection or your forecast this was
[2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:16.400]  this deep and quicker than most people thought i mean this is definitely a catastrophic is it not
[2:31:16.400 --> 2:31:21.120]  i mean i know you're saying it'll take a while to unfold and extrapolate and unwind but i mean
[2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:27.360]  does this mean when it unwind just going to be that much worse yes and you know it's just like
[2:31:27.360 --> 2:31:35.120]  the early 1930s only it's far worse because we had a solvent government we had a positive trade
[2:31:35.120 --> 2:31:42.320]  balance we had gold back currency uh and so today and nobody had credit cards of course
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:48.160]  and today we have all kinds of debt which didn't exist at that time and that's probably the major
[2:31:48.160 --> 2:31:54.080]  factor uh it not only individual but a corporate look at our government i'd like to go into it
[2:31:54.080 --> 2:32:02.800]  and so these companies that we're using tremendous leverage as you spoke of earlier uh they're
[2:32:02.800 --> 2:32:10.560]  getting caught with the pants down and uh they're proposing and arranging all of these mergers so
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:18.240]  that some of these companies can get together and survive and yes we've just lost fanny and freddy and
[2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:24.080]  and layman and bierstern's before that and now they're talking about a washington mutual and
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:33.360]  and what covia and uh even goodness gracious a goldman fax and and at the same time they're
[2:32:33.360 --> 2:32:40.640]  they're they're calling all over the country demanding that these large pensions and institutions
[2:32:40.640 --> 2:32:48.320]  stop lending their stock to people who are shorting the market now that is totally illegal i mean
[2:32:48.320 --> 2:32:54.320]  there's no way you could legalize that and what they're saying is let's go hold on bob here we go
[2:32:54.320 --> 2:33:04.160]  the market bob here we go to the full audience alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:11.600]  bob chatman over and over again the last few years while been interviewing you since 2000 but over
[2:33:11.600 --> 2:33:18.720]  and over again the last few years you talked about naked shorts and short selling and how these
[2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:21.840]  brokerage firms are taking the hundreds of billions a day being given to them by the
[2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:27.920]  federal reserve the private federal reserve our money on our name and they're still leveraging
[2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:33.840]  and shorting and pulling scams and games explain that to people uh for those that don't understand
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:40.160]  until finally yesterday the treasury saying oh well we may change rules to restrict this but that only
[2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:45.520]  means uh on the low level people doesn't it it's it's more selective enforcement so so a breakdown
[2:33:45.520 --> 2:33:51.040]  how those how those little financial scams work how they are illegal uh and they're saying well
[2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:57.760]  we're now going to you know enforce what is illegal uh and then where you see this going
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:02.640]  well first of all i don't think they're going to enforce it i'll wait and see
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:11.520]  i noticed mr mckay and call for the resignation of mr cox as head of the sec the sec has been a
[2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:17.840]  handmade to wall street for years they never go after any crooks on wall street they only go after
[2:34:17.840 --> 2:34:24.160]  the people who they think might be crooks in the middle size and small brokerage houses
[2:34:24.160 --> 2:34:30.800]  and attack who people who write newsletters like me and they cook up all these spurious schemes to
[2:34:30.800 --> 2:34:36.000]  make it look like they're doing something when the people at the major firms have been running
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:47.760]  rampant for years now with that said we have a situation where they've said no more naked short
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:53.200]  selling and i'm not going to go in and describe how that's done it's just it's illegal then
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:03.680]  we just saw here on cnbc today that the government is calling up the people who run the pension and
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:10.320]  profit sharing funds and telling them not to lend their stock to people who want to borrow it in
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:17.200]  order to go short now that's illegal you can't do that the government can't do that i mean you
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:24.000]  may as well just shut down all the markets because this thing we don't want the financial stocks to
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:28.560]  go down or anything else to go down because we want to live happily ever after what they're not
[2:35:28.560 --> 2:35:34.400]  telling you is they've been rigging the markets since 1988 they've been rigging them in a big way
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:39.600]  for the last 10 years and they want to continue doing so so people won't know what's going on
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:47.120]  and so the next step is the merger of the firms that have been out there
[2:35:47.120 --> 2:35:53.680]  leveraged a hundred to one or rating triple a paper which is triple b and scamming even
[2:35:53.680 --> 2:35:59.360]  other bankers i mean the europeans are furious they're sitting with 48 percent of the toxic
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:05.920]  garbage and probably another 10 percent is in asia and the rest of it is in america and now
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:10.080]  they're saying it's all got to be re-rated but the but the insurance firms that rated have been
[2:36:10.080 --> 2:36:13.920]  caught in all the fraud the accounting firms have been caught in the fraud like arthur anderson
[2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:20.400]  we're having in ron's level implosions every hour forget every day all of this is going on
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:24.960]  and there's no talk of investigations no talk of indictments in fact they're talking about
[2:36:25.520 --> 2:36:29.040]  basically just giving immunity to the top bankers to just do whatever they want
[2:36:29.040 --> 2:36:36.480]  you're absolutely correct and that's where they're scrambling that's where it's out of control
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:42.880]  and they're trying to bring about a controlled collapse so that they can control it when we
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:48.560]  get on the bottom wherever that is and so they're merging companies together good example today
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:54.480]  they emerge they want to merge together walk over your bank which has a modicum of problems
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:59.760]  and no i would say on a scale of 10 their problems are probably a five
[2:37:01.120 --> 2:37:05.200]  and they want to merge it with morgan stanley whose problems are probably
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:15.360]  probably a two or a three and so the reason they're doing that is not because they're worried
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:21.760]  about morgan stanley they're worried about walkovia and so that's why they want to bring
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:30.240]  the two of them together and walkovia can along with morgan stanley generate the capital flow
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:34.480]  that's necessary to keep them in business and that's what they're up to but i will say this
[2:37:35.360 --> 2:37:40.560]  and i've said it before on the program you're safer in the brokerage house than you are on the bank
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:45.600]  because the accounts in the brokerage house are insured for five hundred thousand dollars and more
[2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:50.320]  and at the bank you're covered for a hundred grand and that's it and that and and now a whole bunch
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:56.480]  of analysts i mean it's all over the news there's so many sources are saying a thousand banks are
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:38:04.560]  going to fail up from just a hundred we have a we we had a prominent individuals say by the time
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:11.760]  this is over over four thousand banks will fail and they will i mean i've got a list right now
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:17.200]  they were sent to me this morning that i'm printing as an addendum to the international
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:21.760]  forecaster when it goes out and sadly it's going to take up a lot of space going to do it anyway
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:27.120]  it's a whole list of banks that get problems where their ratings have been dropped and i
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:32.800]  can't even remember who sent it to me but thank you very much and we get we get stuff like this
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:38.160]  all from all over the world yeah internal stuff every day uh bob give me a favor will you send

[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:51.360]  a couple times a day will you send me a copy of that and i hold on one second uh erin a a r r
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:39:01.680]  yeah it's two a's a r o n yep at info wars at info wars dot com and i already get the forecaster
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:06.160]  but then i have it in my email so clogged i have to look around for it but but please give me that
[2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:10.960]  folks you can subscribe and get a free copy at the international forecaster dot com

[2:39:15.280 --> 2:39:18.880]  hard copy now now now bob in just a few minutes we've got left with you today
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:23.120]  and as this develops i may have to get you on every day if you can do it because there's
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:29.520]  so much happening for your little quick 10 minute blurbs um i want to talk about gold and and and
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:34.560]  kind of recap what we've seen it do the last two days what this means how they try to suppress it
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:38.960]  what this failure to suppress it means if you think it'll go back down again before it goes back
[2:39:38.960 --> 2:39:45.680]  up or if or if this is the final suppression before it goes where it should be at 2800 3000
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:51.280]  you know just a dollar parity the devaluation from 1980 numbers uh so i mean give me a few
[2:39:51.280 --> 2:39:55.680]  minutes on gold and then a few minutes uh just on any other key areas people need to know about
[2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:02.800]  well uh you give me a lot more credit i am not a soothsayer but look at this they deliberately
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:07.840]  drove gold down because they knew these problems were coming and they figured if we get it down
[2:40:07.840 --> 2:40:12.720]  it's going to go back up again but it'll go back up again from a lower level and so that's what
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:17.520]  they were up to now can they do it again if they can attempt to do it again they can do it through
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:23.440]  derivatives in the futures market but how much gold do they have left they being the central banks
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:30.240]  nobody knows they lie about everything how much do i think they've got left somewhere between zero
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:37.280]  and five thousand tons that's it that's all they've got left the rest of it is in private hands i mean
[2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:45.120]  just in august alone and this is before the season of the two holidays in india in august alone
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:49.120]  people in india bought more gold than he did in the first seven months of the year
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:55.280]  i mean they can't buy it fast enough let's put it in layman's terms you've got the elite with the
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:41:00.640]  tens of trillions of false currency and credit they made because they know that's going to suddenly
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:05.920]  be worthless grabbing everything for the last 10 years they can get with the fiat currency and
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:10.560]  leaving us with the debt on our backs and our children's backs a debt that could never be paid
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:14.560]  back but at gunpoint the militaries and try to make you pay it back uh to them when they did the
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:20.240]  robbery uh their bosses did uh and and so now the elite keep trying to suppress gold but because
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:26.800]  all the elites and the populations want gold it is in reality running low and hard to get so is
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:32.720]  silver and so they can only hold down the beach ball 10 feet underwater so long and when you
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:36.480]  finally let go of the beach ball it's going to shoot straight up and go up even higher i mean
[2:41:36.480 --> 2:41:42.720]  is that a good way of putting it absolutely and what we have here with this the technical formation
[2:41:43.360 --> 2:41:49.440]  is it should go right back up right through 900 and it should go back up and test 1033 where it
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:54.560]  was earlier in the year and then it will be broken we need to get up to somewhere between
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:42:04.320]  2700 to 3000 to meet the official inflation rate since 1980 and that will be a threshold
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:12.080]  and then the question is how much was real inflation real not the government figures
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:17.280]  since 1980 and of course we're looking at six or seven thousand dollars now for those that don't
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:23.600]  know me these guys the enemy are buying gold i promise you even though they run it down when
[2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:26.080]  when they do they run in there and buy it for themselves
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:33.920]  well i'm central banks were selling they were in part the buyers well i know that's come out in
[2:42:33.920 --> 2:42:38.480]  some of the press reports that the the i mean the elites are snatching it so are third world
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:44.560]  populations they're not stupid the russians the folks in the stands the indians the chinese the
[2:42:44.560 --> 2:42:50.320]  japanese are snatching metals up because folks you don't go buy some fancy jewelry that has two
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:56.160]  three times mark up in it you buy the raw metal because you can get it as close as possible
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:43:02.160]  to spot and you know i wouldn't tell people to invest in gold unless i believed in it and
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:04.720]  that's why i've been saying the last few weeks folks it's going to go back up it's going to go
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:11.040]  back up there's no way with market fundamentals with trillions of dollars a week leveraged into
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:16.640]  lord knows what as you said it's all secret being guaranteed to these bankers and it's in our name
[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:20.400]  i mean how long until the dollar's toilet paper i mean that's a guarantee now isn't it bob
[2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:27.200]  yes it is and it's just a question of one and it it's down the line and so you're buying gold
[2:43:27.200 --> 2:43:33.600]  cheap and that's why you should be getting it yourself into the gold and silver related assets
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:40.400]  the first place to start is with gold coins silver coins and for those of you have a lots of money
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:47.520]  and kind of can take risk when you can buy the shares as well and it's very important that you
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:54.080]  get involved because if you don't your assets are going to diminuate in value and this will
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:43:59.280]  keep you even by having your investment in gold and silver during the hyper inflationary period
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:05.280]  that's right they can't hide the 15 percent inflation conservatively some areas it's even higher
[2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:10.240]  they can't hide that forever for the election they drove down oil for a while but the bottom line
[2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:17.040]  here is uh this inflation is compounding each year it's adding on stacking on top of the last year
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:22.320]  and and inflation has a way of telescoping doesn't it bob historically that that that you're really
[2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:27.680]  going to suddenly start feeling it not on a monthly or yearly basis but a weekly basis and then a
[2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:34.400]  daily basis until all confidence is lost in the currency and that's what's happening or beginning
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:41.360]  to happen now when you know i predicted because i've seen it before 50 and 100 dollar days where
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:47.360]  gold is up and gold is down as well we're going to go into a very volatile market and it will not
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:54.000]  be unusual for a 50 dollar uh upswing and gold for the day and and that might go on for three or
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:45:01.200]  four days at a time people will be in a flight to quality they've got to understand that all
[2:45:01.200 --> 2:45:07.680]  the currencies in the world is suspect they are all fiat that's right and loss of respect for one
[2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:13.840]  will will uh spread to others uh in closing bob i really appreciate you coming on i want you to
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:19.840]  pop back in maybe tomorrow certainly uh next week we appreciate well just tell me the time and
[2:45:19.840 --> 2:45:26.560]  and don't forget uh we have a number for people to come in on uh to get a free copy the international
[2:45:26.560 --> 2:45:40.000]  forecast so that's 877-429-479-8178 that's 877-479-8178 and they can get a free copy absolutely well
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:45.200]  bob i appreciate you spending time with us and we'll talk to you soon thank you very much bye
[2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:53.920]  there he goes uh ladies and gentlemen gold is up 35 dollars today still rising still rising
[2:45:53.920 --> 2:46:04.240]  the graph goes like this and so it's going up gradually and it went up right at 80 dollars
[2:46:04.240 --> 2:46:19.120]  yesterday and 35 80 and 35 that's just amazing that's uh 115 and 10 cent rise in 24 hours
[2:46:19.120 --> 2:46:25.600]  bottom line ladies and gentlemen i told you on monday it was a buying opportunity
[2:46:26.160 --> 2:46:33.120]  at 779 and i said i can't believe it hasn't gone up yet i mean the fanny may freddy mac
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:38.960]  this is all in the dollar's back this is la la land this is like trying to hold a beach ball
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:42.800]  underwater you ever try to do that and try to really push it down like five feet under the water
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:48.480]  this is beach ball like a hundred feet under the water and you're down there with a ball
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:56.240]  and chain you know tied to your ankle trying to hold the ball down and now it's exploded over
[2:46:56.240 --> 2:47:02.960]  a hundred dollars in one day 115 dollars and in uh 24 hours i don't know what it's going to do by
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:07.760]  the end of the day i don't know what it's going to be next week but bottom line the dollar is dead
[2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:13.200]  bottom line they are raping the daylights out of us and bob's right i mean they've engineered the
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:18.880]  collapse but it's gotten worse than they wanted but they're still trying to organize it and control it
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:24.800]  i want to bring ted anderson up for this segment the next then we've got april gallup
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:28.400]  by the way i forgot her bio i know who she is well you asked the guys for down on time
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:33.520]  so i have it in 10 minutes to give me april gallup's bio and i know her whole story but i want to
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:40.320]  have that uh i had it my here i don't know where it is she survived in the pentagon heroic tale
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:48.560]  and uh it ties into 911 truth and so we'll be getting into that uh ted yesterday you offered
[2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:55.680]  gold at the price it was tuesday uh at uh right around we were selling it for right around 800
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:02.960]  dollars an ounce it's gone up uh over a hundred dollars from what you were selling in it but
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:10.160]  you offered it at that yesterday and uh sold out a little bit over even your supply but you've got
[2:48:10.160 --> 2:48:16.320]  it being shipped in so uh you know at that price so you're even losing a little money on that but
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:22.960]  that did in this morning uh you've got another big deal because you were able to get it at at at
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:27.920]  before the price it is today and even back a little lower than it was yesterday and that was the best
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:31.680]  deal ever offered and you told me this probably on the phone you've ever offered or you've ever
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:37.920]  heard of it was an insane deal and you're honoring that uh you sold out your safe of the gold at that
[2:48:37.920 --> 2:48:43.600]  price you now you've bought more gold uh at the higher price we talked this morning folks uh but
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:49.760]  you've you've still got a super deal on it today and uh folks i tried to get you to buy it monday

[2:48:55.520 --> 2:49:00.640]  mean uh yesterday we did we oversold our inventory we're going to honor every single transaction
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:05.840]  just means that i'll be buying it higher and selling it for lower uh that's okay i'll survive i
[2:49:05.840 --> 2:49:11.200]  appreciate what everybody does for us uh the second thing is i did lock in a position when gold was
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:17.920]  sitting there at that uh 800 and uh 870 dollar level right around there and now we're sitting with
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:25.040]  a high end goal of 918 10 today right now it's hovering at 960 cents per ounce or over 900
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:29.840]  dollars per ounce yeah let's be clear this is like gambling folks and ted puts everything on the line
[2:49:30.400 --> 2:49:35.680]  he he gambled gave you a deal never before seen he lost money okay he's honoring it all he
[2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:42.000]  he wants to you know have customers is a great guy uh now he locked it in yesterday and it's gone up
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:48.000]  a whole bunch more over that he's going to offer it to you at the locked in amount now ted if you
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:52.400]  sell out you're locked in a mount you're i guess you're going to honor that as well i certainly
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:57.360]  will and i can tell you yesterday is the first time i've ever sold gold coins that far below spot
[2:49:57.360 --> 2:50:02.080]  it was amazing that i could do it and i'm glad i'm able to do it everybody who bought is winning
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:07.600]  right now that's just a perfect mix there is something still alex from last week that i still
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:13.840]  have inventory on and then that and that's those walking liberty halves i have them at 695 silver
[2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:20.400]  now rather than being 10 dollars an ounce is 12 dollars and 98 cents an ounce almost 13 dollars
[2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:27.280]  an ounce and i haven't moved the prices on those that is a that that will not be here i can tell
[2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:33.840]  you that you've got you've got silver gorgeous half dollars it's a pretty silver coin i've got
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:43.440]  right now below spot folks that deal is insane 800 686 2237 i love offering my listeners deals
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:50.320]  like this 800 686 2237 come back we're gonna tell you about the gold deal um briefly with ted
[2:50:50.320 --> 2:50:56.320]  anderson stay with us cameras are everywhere let's skip this break let's skip this break i mean for
[2:50:56.320 --> 2:51:00.160]  the network we're gonna leave the break but but but but bring ted in here for the internet listeners
[2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:03.920]  i don't want to waste any time tell let's come back with everybody on the gold issue but but
[2:51:03.920 --> 2:51:08.400]  but i mean getting down to brass tacks we were scared six months ago in private phone conversations
[2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:12.880]  we're both freaking out i mean this is great for folks that invest in gold and silver in it but i
[2:51:12.880 --> 2:51:18.480]  mean watching rome berm is not fun this is an emergency survival package to try to just save
[2:51:18.480 --> 2:51:23.440]  wealth i mean will it go up will it go down most probably up and up and up and up and up but with
[2:51:23.440 --> 2:51:28.800]  that rome burns the point is is that this is a life preserver you there's no question
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:34.320]  that you need gold and silver and ted's a great place to get it so he's got that silver the he's
[2:51:34.320 --> 2:51:39.200]  got the gold it's just a higher price and we'll talk about that coming up but dealing with the
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:43.760]  economy ted i mean this is even getting worse faster than i thought it would this is worse than
[2:51:43.760 --> 2:51:51.520]  we've uh... you know the the uh... the prospectus we put out your comments well yeah i mean it really
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:55.680]  is i mean you look at the kind of the institutions right now that are failing
[2:51:55.680 --> 2:51:59.600]  and the kind of bailouts that are coming out of the united states government
[2:51:59.600 --> 2:52:04.640]  and uh... where the stock market is in the volatility there and consider the fact that
[2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:08.560]  if you have over a hundred thousand dollars of the bank you're at risk and you know there's so
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:14.000]  many people that have have uh... mutual funds and uh... the stocks and they have money in the bank
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:19.200]  through these 401k plans and it's it's a house of cards and the biggest problem is not so much
[2:52:19.200 --> 2:52:23.360]  that there's gonna be bankruptcies and you lose everything the biggest risk is that the united
[2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:29.600]  states dollar is is is being bombarded right now because of the new currency coming into the system
[2:52:29.600 --> 2:52:34.000]  to bail out these problems i mean we could be looking at twenty percent maybe thirty percent
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:39.440]  inflation the kind of inflation that argentine and brazil went through or even it could be as bad as
[2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:44.800]  the weimar republic because the fact that the that we're trying to solve our problems by injecting
[2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:49.440]  money into the suit that in the system i just i like the way petersha put it man we need to let
[2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:55.120]  the problems come and let the economy adjust go through this thing and on the other side will
[2:52:55.120 --> 2:52:59.760]  come out okay but instead of doing that the united states governments try to step in and
[2:52:59.760 --> 2:53:05.440]  bail everything out and and you just can't do that by doing that it affects the entire system
[2:53:05.440 --> 2:53:10.160]  it does affect the entire system elix we're just that we're driving this this this economy in the
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:13.440]  united states right into the floor and the people you know they don't know what's coming
[2:53:13.440 --> 2:53:18.000]  and what's going to hit them and uh... you know i i don't know how to say it enough i mean
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:21.520]  we don't even know how to grow food here as a nation you know the farmers
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:26.560]  the farmers are sitting there you know with all this grain and everything that no no we're going
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:31.680]  to the concentration camp economy i mean it's a pentagon plan for all the out there giggling
[2:53:31.680 --> 2:53:36.400]  smirking just keep it up i mean we tried to warn you jackasses well you know the thing about it

[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:52.800]  with his great brokers who stayed there till past midnight last night uh the most amount of calls
[2:54:52.800 --> 2:54:58.320]  they ever got yesterday from the show period they've been on coast to coast a m uh so i hope that uh
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:03.680]  you will uh give them a call right now at eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:08.720]  hundred six eight six two two three seven now the best deal ever in the history that i've ever
[2:55:08.720 --> 2:55:12.880]  heard of and the teds are not just him that we ever heard of it was an insane deal yesterday
[2:55:12.880 --> 2:55:19.200]  ted has won almost as good which might break the other records as well uh after his record uh but
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:24.560]  tell folks the specifics of the deal ted uh yeah right now we locked into the the goal that that at
[2:55:24.560 --> 2:55:29.520]  eight hundred and seventy one right in that range uh we were looking at british sovereigns are currently
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:34.480]  the right now they're at two hundred and forty one dollars per coin we have the francs at 193
[2:55:34.480 --> 2:55:41.520]  now alex the day before the day before today you could pick up those francs at 217 rather than
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:46.800]  241 these are still below the spot price you're not going to find them out there because spot now
[2:55:46.800 --> 2:55:54.080]  has jumped over 900 bucks and uh and two days ago i was offering the silver halves at 695 and
[2:55:54.080 --> 2:55:59.120]  they were ten dollars and some last time silver was up in that 18 dollar range right in there well
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:04.000]  guess what silver's just blowing through all the levels right now it's 13 and uh and i locked this
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:09.760]  stuff in at 10 so this is exactly the same buy if you missed out on something yesterday you still
[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:14.640]  have an opportunity today to get on those walking liberty halves and i really okay so there's the
[2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:21.200]  same below spot deal it's just now you uh pay more because you waited but the point is it's still
[2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:26.080]  the same insane level no no alex you're getting that wrong it's the same price as yesterday they
[2:56:26.080 --> 2:56:30.800]  haven't gone up yet it it's that much better of a deal because spot has gone up but i didn't
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:35.520]  understand that excuse me i'm selling the silver halves for the same price i did when i got on
[2:56:35.520 --> 2:56:40.800]  your show on monday there there i understand that part the gold the gold prices are up yeah a little
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:44.240]  bit that's that's right i couldn't do that anymore i understand ted i understand lost

[3:00:10.080 --> 3:00:14.560]  to air that at the end of the show today at least part of it i got a key government clip from a few
[3:00:14.560 --> 3:00:22.240]  days ago where he admits about the forced injection of immigrants with vaccines that are not mandatory
[3:00:22.240 --> 3:00:28.240]  for citizens so he also is that there's a hoax that citizens have to take it too and this government's
[3:00:28.240 --> 3:00:33.120]  completely criminal i mean i'm sure they lie about everything he's really something else
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:36.480]  uh... he tells the truth about government sponsored terror and everything now that's why
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:40.160]  they're trying to force him out that's officially fired him from election coverage and they're
[3:00:40.160 --> 3:00:44.480]  trying to get him out for the next administration that's been in the news that oberman's probably
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:49.840]  on his way out i want to play about a one-minute clip of him talking about the vaccines then this
[3:00:49.840 --> 3:00:57.040]  disgusting Rothschild uh... the uh... wife of the baron she goes night she says she's just a commoner
[3:00:57.040 --> 3:01:01.600]  a no big deal person the fact that they're now all over tv and i don't mean if you have the name
[3:01:01.600 --> 3:01:07.280]  rothschild big huge family tens of thousands i mean this is the wife of the kingpin you know
[3:01:07.280 --> 3:01:13.200]  rothschild's almost like when it comes to jewish people like the name jones uh... but uh...
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:20.560]  you know for for for welsh uh... or or or the name uh... you know uh... vladimir for russians
[3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:25.760]  you know real popular so i'm blaming all rothschild's here but this is a very wicked rothschild and
[3:01:25.760 --> 3:01:32.000]  you watch the video on info wars dot com she just so arrogant so hateful so we'll play a part of
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:37.760]  both these clips back to back first oberman then the uh... rothschild shoveling bs on the public
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:45.360]  here it is number three vaccine gate it is revealed the two months ago mr bush's immigration
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:51.680]  department added a new mandatory vaccination for anybody seeking u.s. citizenship garthasil
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:57.840]  which protects against human a human papillomavirus hpv which is 19 months ago the head of immunization
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:02.480]  for the centers for disease control insisted garthasil should not be mandatory for americans
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:08.320]  because hpv is not communicable like say chickenpox is so now if you're a citizen you don't have to
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:13.600]  be vaccinated if you want to become a citizen you do meaning we are demanding they take away the
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:19.040]  right to choose the right we give citizens oh and we also got another group of human guinea pigs for
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:26.000]  this vaccine and murk gets to charge them 162 bucks a pot number two passport gate remember
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:32.560]  this that explosive night when it was revealed somebody had access linda forster to rothschild
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:38.000]  is here with us in the situation room and we're going to get your reaction now this was a surprise
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:43.280]  because you've been a democrat for a long time you love hillary clinton and she says don't vote for
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:49.120]  mccain and palin why do you decide to cross over let me just go back to your piece if i may for a
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:56.000]  minute uh it is true i am married to a wonderful a wonderful man whose name is dorothschild it is
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:03:02.800]  also he's a baron and he's a knight okay but not to quibble but i grew up in a middle class
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:10.720]  family in new jersey my parents worked two jobs to put four children to through college law school
[3:03:10.720 --> 3:03:16.000]  and medical school and we were told the american dream could be ours because we live in a great
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:21.680]  country and i have lived the dream because what they're saying the obama people you just heard
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:26.720]  uh that congresswoman suggests that lady baroness the rothschild who is that to be talking about
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:32.400]  elitism when when you are obviously uh among the elite right now see this is so sad when the
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:38.320]  democratic party plays the class card and they try to divide america and they try to say that
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:45.600]  somehow my opinion is less worthy than another person's because i have this wonderful life i
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:51.440]  have a wonderful life i want john mccain and sarah palin in the white house so other people can
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:55.760]  have that wonderful because a lot of clinton supporters know can i call you lin yes of course
[3:03:55.760 --> 3:03:59.520]  okay a lot of a lot of clinton supporters say you know on so many of the issues
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:05.440]  that you supported worked really hard for hillary clinton the democrats the mccain palin ticket is
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:10.480]  opposite of what you believe in on some of the social issues for example i assume on gay rights
[3:04:10.480 --> 3:04:15.680]  or abortion rights or sex education in school some of these issues you feel comfortable with
[3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:22.560]  mccain and palin see the democratic party tries to take those issues as wedge issues there is no
[3:04:22.560 --> 3:04:28.800]  question that john mccain and sarah palin are going to take away the right to choose or they're
[3:04:28.800 --> 3:04:34.640]  going to take away gay rights that's not what they're there for they're there for ordinary americans
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:40.400]  this people who they are and the people who they fought for that's why i support them but you support
[3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:44.320]  abortion rights for example i support abortion rights are you concerned you know i'm not for
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:49.440]  barack obama but when you get this witch supporting mccain it makes you wonder stay with us we'll be
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:57.280]  right back the day unlike any other in the long course of american history a terrorist act of war
[3:04:57.280 --> 3:05:02.640]  again you got april gallup take away the right to choose are they're going to take away gay rights
[3:05:02.640 --> 3:05:08.480]  that's not what they're there for they're there for ordinary americans this people who they are and
[3:05:08.480 --> 3:05:13.760]  the people who they fought for that's why i support them but you support abortion rights for example
[3:05:13.760 --> 3:05:18.240]  i support abortion right you're concerned you know i'm not for barack obama but when you get this
[3:05:18.240 --> 3:05:25.520]  witch supporting mccain it makes you wonder stay with us we'll be right back the day unlike any other
[3:05:25.520 --> 3:05:31.280]  in the long course of american history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemies

[3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:29.520]  one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:34.240]  checking up on my wife making sure she has the things she needs but mostly providing for my family
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:38.960]  and knowing that they are secure that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins they
[3:07:38.960 --> 3:07:43.520]  don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives i've
[3:07:43.520 --> 3:07:47.920]  always wanted to be a good provider and i'm not going to change that now just because the economy
[3:07:47.920 --> 3:07:52.160]  is in up evil and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty and i hear
[3:07:52.160 --> 3:08:05.120]  about global famines and i see the escalation alex jones on the gcn radio network i'm going to let
[3:08:05.120 --> 3:08:10.960]  her introduce herself and you know give us some background and really walk through this story
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:15.840]  some have heard it others haven't it's all documented april gallup worked inside the
[3:08:15.840 --> 3:08:23.120]  pentagon on 9 11 as she has an administrative specialist with a top security top secret
[3:08:23.840 --> 3:08:34.240]  security clearance with sci with the us army and we're going to tell the story of what she
[3:08:34.240 --> 3:08:41.360]  witnessed on that day and the tremendous injuries and trauma on 9 11 that she uh that she survived
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:47.200]  and i really want to thank april gallup for coming on with us today to first tell her story
[3:08:47.200 --> 3:08:51.760]  of what happened then and the fight she's going through right now april it's great to have you
[3:08:51.760 --> 3:08:59.520]  on the show with us thank you for having me alex you bet uh start at the beginning who you were
[3:08:59.520 --> 3:09:03.760]  what you were doing there what happened that day and then now what's happened after all the key
[3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:11.920]  issues place okay uh september 11 2001 i was returning back uh from maternity leave um and
[3:09:11.920 --> 3:09:20.240]  with that come uh getting situated um i was asked uh to take care of some paperwork prior to taking
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:27.520]  my son to daycare uh so i said yes of course to do what they said but honestly i didn't think
[3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:33.520]  that they were actually going to clear my son uh to get through but somehow on that particular day
[3:09:33.520 --> 3:09:42.640]  he was able to get cleared uh to go uh in the back with me when i sat down at the desk i pulled out
[3:09:42.640 --> 3:09:51.120]  the keyboard i went to touch the computer and as soon as i touched the button boom um and then of
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:09:58.400]  course the rest is history now from an insider's perspective because it happened simultaneously
[3:09:58.400 --> 3:10:04.880]  when i touched the keyboard the and when i touched the button on the uh screen i thought i triggered
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:10.400]  something i mean that's just you know by virtue of what took place yeah that was probably just a
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:15.600]  coincidence because when i was covering a bill de berger meeting a few months ago right as i go to
[3:10:15.600 --> 3:10:21.680]  open the door to go back in the room and there was a tv crew inside right as i open the door right
[3:10:21.680 --> 3:10:25.760]  as i start cracking it the alarm goes off and i'm like my god what did i touch i tried to
[3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:30.480]  saying rob what did you touch but but but but it wasn't uh that it just so happened to happen right
[3:10:30.480 --> 3:10:36.480]  as i turned the door right as i swipe the key and right as i push it down it happened so you hit
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:42.400]  the keyboard right you get to work boom okay uh continue you're at the pentagon supposedly an
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:48.880]  aircraft just slammed into it right and of course being on the inside there were no alarms no hints
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:56.240]  with everything that was going on um and they're always watching you know news around the world
[3:10:56.240 --> 3:11:04.240]  24 seven in the pentagon there were no alarms no hints no warnings nothing so you know that was
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:14.240]  another um wow how how come um and of course you know i eventually i came to um and we got out of
[3:11:14.240 --> 3:11:21.040]  the debris and i lost my shoes and i and i bring this part up very crucial because i walked barefoot
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:31.600]  it out with my son um and i didn't see you know various types of debris or you know anything to
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:39.280]  that nature that would cause me to think wow i was in a bomb that was a plane so i was quite surprised
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:48.560]  um and then when i was told and as i continued to relive the incident i i tried to see how
[3:11:48.560 --> 3:11:55.200]  was it possible you know i try to rationalize the situation after i was given the information
[3:11:55.200 --> 3:11:58.640]  yeah let's go back and walk through this slowly i mean i mean describe you're in there with your
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:03.360]  newborn baby uh you just brought him into the pentagon right as you sit down to go to work
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:08.960]  the huge explosion i know what are you seeing in there i mean you describe not seeing plane debris
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:15.360]  or luggage or people or anything what are you seeing i mean there's images of inside the pentagon
[3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:20.080]  where it's just sheer blown out and cut and there's still computers and desks sitting there
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:26.240]  untouched but the plane just disappears right i mean you could see that there were you could see
[3:12:26.240 --> 3:12:33.200]  where the inside the computer they were still burning um i guess stuff i don't know what the
[3:12:33.200 --> 3:12:40.320]  inside of stuff in the ceiling was that it all came down um there was still some um office
[3:12:40.320 --> 3:12:44.720]  i don't know if it was desk equipment whatever it was it was all piled on top of each other
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:53.200]  but seemed it was more like we were blown and then covered under just debris um the metal desk
[3:12:53.920 --> 3:13:00.080]  weren't moved that much from what i saw but that was it now you are right along the line of
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:06.880]  the explosion there um your office from that outer ring where where was your office along that line
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:13.680]  of the first uh several rings that got penetrated by the projectile right we were right there what
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:21.280]  they would consider as the uh ground zero we were in the first corridor e-ring fifth floor
[3:13:21.280 --> 3:13:27.760]  so you you had an outside uh seat then you were right up on the edge of the ring right
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:35.680]  right so we were right there um i don't know if you know i try to rationalize it the black
[3:13:35.680 --> 3:13:41.680]  savers when we got blown a little bit i mean i really you know i really don't know but you
[3:13:41.680 --> 3:13:48.240]  didn't see any aircraft or any smoking aluminum or any dead bodies burning up it was just uh
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:52.720]  and in fact how bad how big were the fires we have the video of it they look pretty small and
[3:13:52.720 --> 3:13:59.600]  uh it's pretty clean 16 foot i mean they you know they weren't i guess when you're trying to get
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:04.720]  yourself together maybe in the beginning it might seem that things seemed a little bit
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:08.400]  exaggerated because again you don't know what's happened oh no it was terrible you're in there
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:13.600]  in a big explosion like right you know you hear this baby crying you're wondering what's going
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:20.080]  on thank god your baby was okay i mean how's your baby doing all that well um again he had is
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:24.320]  it was rough and you know in the beginning because he was so young and his head was all
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:31.200]  soft and tender um so there was that period we went through with that um but again he had stopped
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:36.000]  crying and so that's what made me get out from under debris because the other young lady that
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:40.160]  was in there she's like get your baby get your baby and i'm like oh that's my baby because you
[3:14:40.160 --> 3:14:45.760]  know you're you're out of sport you're present but then you're not it's like it's real but then
[3:14:45.760 --> 3:14:55.840]  it's really it doesn't feel real yeah um so you know now now now now now where did you climb out
[3:14:56.480 --> 3:15:03.360]  and then after you climbed out did you see the entry hole of the uh weapon um technically they're
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:08.080]  claiming that the area that we came out of that we walked out of was supposed to have been that
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:13.360]  this was the uh trying to think of the name of the office that did the uh scaling of where everybody
[3:15:13.360 --> 3:15:20.400]  was located they said what we came out of was the entry hole i i you know i i don't i don't know i
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:27.040]  know i came out of a big gaping hole and when i came out it felt like you know somebody had
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:31.680]  taken a hammer and beat me from my head all the way down to my body so i collapsed on the grass
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:39.200]  um now how big was that hole it wasn't that big
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:47.760]  big big passenger liner i mean even if it hit it's it's it's engines would have hit you know
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:52.960]  20 yards out 15 yards out you you would have seen those smash up or make holes but it didn't it was
[3:15:52.960 --> 3:16:00.480]  just this this 16-foot hole and uh you know later they came in and dumped sand everywhere in front
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:04.880]  of it to make it look like it was worse and you got some spools there and the grass is doing just
[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:12.240]  fine and you climb out of this burning 15 16-foot hole then later they spray water on it and the top
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:18.080]  collapses in a little bit but still that's only about 20 feet across all right but even you know
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:23.760]  when i when i was coming out and i was about to collapse they grabbed me on both sides of my arm
[3:16:24.560 --> 3:16:28.720]  and they caught Elijah but then the guy who had my right arm came way back in
[3:16:28.720 --> 3:16:37.760]  so i said wow how would you able to do that with that jet fuel and you know you know based off of
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:42.960]  you know official stores and this is just a few minutes after it happens uh there's people right
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:48.080]  after and there's people just going in but the jet fuel burned and melted all the plane
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:52.400]  and burned all the bodies but they're just going right in there it's no problem right
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:16:57.920]  right i mean back and forth now now now yeah please continue
[3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:07.760]  uh april yes okay i was saying please continue with your story okay i'm sorry to hear you that's
[3:17:07.760 --> 3:17:15.120]  okay and so you know again it it seems real but then it didn't but it was you know a moment
[3:17:15.920 --> 3:17:21.040]  and it was a it was a very pivotal moment and i spent a lot of time trying to
[3:17:21.040 --> 3:17:28.240]  you comprehend the whole situation but um i wind up being in a local hospital they want i did want
[3:17:28.240 --> 3:17:33.360]  to eventually go into the hospital but they separated me and my son and later that night
[3:17:34.080 --> 3:17:39.520]  or maybe it was after midnight or maybe early that next morning somebody bought my wallet um
[3:17:39.520 --> 3:17:45.680]  and in my wallet was my id card and my son's id card so then they bought um in my they put it
[3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:51.200]  together but we were still in this triage type setting because it was a room full of other
[3:17:51.200 --> 3:17:57.200]  people and a couple of hours later from that not that i was keeping up with the sense of
[3:17:57.200 --> 3:18:05.120]  time racing uh someone came in and that's when they said do you know what happened and i said well
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:10.400]  no not really i thought maybe i triggered something and then they said this is what happened
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:15.840]  and then that was it it wasn't like they were how are you are you okay how's your
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:20.880]  kid i mean it was nothing like that it was just more of this is what happened well well april
[3:18:20.880 --> 3:18:24.240]  i want to go over the story very carefully here after the break we really appreciate you joining
[3:18:24.240 --> 3:18:30.080]  us but did you know now there's all these videos of of minutes after the towers fall of guys in
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:35.440]  baseball caps professionally walking around saying the same thing about well you know the plane went
[3:18:35.440 --> 3:18:39.360]  in with all that jet fuel and went out the other side and it caused such incredible heat on the
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:44.800]  structural uh weakened the girders and it you know fell from a structural uh weakening of course but
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:49.680]  said it all professionally then the news all repeated it and and now we know what the pentagon
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:54.160]  and at the world trade centers guys would go around saying this is what you saw you didn't see bombs
[3:18:54.160 --> 3:18:58.400]  going off you didn't see that you know and with building seven they told the cops you didn't hear
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:03.600]  us say we were going to blow that up uh so when we come back i want to specifically go back in
[3:19:03.600 --> 3:19:10.240]  every detail you can tell us about who this person was how they were dressed what they look like what
[3:19:10.240 --> 3:19:14.160]  they said to you i mean imagine you're laying there in a bed why shouldn't they care about
[3:19:14.160 --> 3:19:19.360]  somebody at the pentagon who her and her baby were hit i mean they know it's a plane everybody knows
[3:19:19.360 --> 3:19:24.400]  you know why go to an eyewitness and say hi uh you're awake now dear let me tell you what you
[3:19:24.400 --> 3:19:29.760]  just saw okay let's get this real straight right now with you just like they had all the guys on

[3:24:24.240 --> 3:24:31.520]  grown up quite a bit from since that terrible attack seven years ago uh april continuing here
[3:24:31.520 --> 3:24:36.720]  with it as much detail as you can you're laying there in the hospital bed who did he identify
[3:24:36.720 --> 3:24:42.960]  himself as where did he say came from and what did you think i mean as somebody's hovering over you
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:48.560]  telling you this is what you saw this is what happened is that clear you know you got the
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:57.200]  official story understand um i mean go over as much detail as you can well the gentleman
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:25:06.560]  didn't identify his name he was with other military there was like one person in a navy
[3:25:06.560 --> 3:25:13.280]  uniform and one in an army uniform but the gentleman who spoke was just in regular clothing
[3:25:13.280 --> 3:25:20.240]  he didn't really say hi i'm so and so it was not like how are you doing i'm so and so you know
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:26.400]  i'm with he never identified organization or no he's an he's a spook he's the kind of guy that
[3:25:26.400 --> 3:25:31.680]  launches missiles in the buildings he's a blood thirsty spook killer spook uh and he's there to
[3:25:31.680 --> 3:25:36.720]  let you know young lady this is what you saw isn't that right because i'm a hardcore soldier and i
[3:25:36.720 --> 3:25:42.960]  understand collateral damage and sacrificing pawns and you don't uh so so so i mean he's there
[3:25:42.960 --> 3:25:48.480]  what are the other guys doing i mean was he white was he black i mean describe him uh he was a
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:54.800]  Caucasian american and he was accompanied by an african american and i think the other woman
[3:25:54.800 --> 3:26:00.320]  was asian american okay so the spook house is there and and and you're saying they're in
[3:26:00.320 --> 3:26:06.880]  different branches of the military uniforms do you remember yes because after he left the lady
[3:26:06.880 --> 3:26:14.240]  did come back and um she was saying that they were going around you know doing accountability
[3:26:14.240 --> 3:26:19.840]  because i had asked questions i was like well wow i mean you know are you gonna ask if i'm okay
[3:26:19.840 --> 3:26:26.720]  or i mean well who are you you know and so nobody said anything he just said what he had to say
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:32.640]  and that was it so then she came back and then she just said hey we have to do accountability and
[3:26:32.640 --> 3:26:37.520]  make sure we know where all the military people are exactly it's like smooth that over with her
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:42.000]  that one might ask questions now i mean by then are you wondering why you're seeing on the news
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:46.960]  or had you watched the news that a flight no i had not seen the news i had not seen the news till
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:53.680]  about two more days later so i think i saw the news maybe the 14th or the 15th
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:26:59.440]  because at that time of course we're getting an evaluation
[3:27:01.360 --> 3:27:05.440]  because immediately the military does the investigation determine who's at fault or if
[3:27:05.440 --> 3:27:12.400]  you cause part of your accident so immediately investigations began so immediately i went into
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:18.080]  investigation well let's stop and go back and then we'll go forward into investigation what
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:23.360]  specifically did he say to you what did he say he said here's what you saw i'm going to tell you
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:31.280]  what you saw what did he say specifically he said what do you think happened and i said oh well
[3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:35.200]  i thought maybe i triggered something because as soon as i touched the button on the computer boom
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:43.440]  it was like no this is what happened and that was it and it was like he was elaborating or
[3:27:45.600 --> 3:27:51.360]  and an additional and it's blank straight to the point april what did he tell you happened
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:59.760]  what did he say happened that some terrorists had hijacked the plane that ran into
[3:27:59.760 --> 3:28:06.880]  you or crashed into the Pentagon now have you ever talked to others because this story comes
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:11.440]  up with other emergency workers that showed up people in the middle that these men would show
[3:28:11.440 --> 3:28:15.760]  up and say this is what you saw is that clear did you ever talk to anybody else who told you
[3:28:15.760 --> 3:28:24.240]  similar stories no i hadn't no i hadn't talked to anybody okay uh now you said you immediately
[3:28:24.240 --> 3:28:29.760]  went into the investigation phase please continue yeah what happened is when you're in you're in
[3:28:29.760 --> 3:28:36.640]  military regardless uh first of all the Pentagon you're selected to come there so not everybody
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:41.760]  gets to go to the Pentagon you're selected to come there but it doesn't matter if you're still
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:48.080]  active duty military uh they do they begin investigations determine if any part of that
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:55.120]  incident was your fault and so then you have to get you know physically mentally emotionally
[3:28:55.120 --> 3:28:59.760]  evaluated and then they investigate the incident to determine who's at fault
[3:29:02.880 --> 3:29:05.600]  and so those those that that began right away
[3:29:08.720 --> 3:29:14.480]  and from there they say yeah this is what happened none of it is your fault or they say
[3:29:14.480 --> 3:29:19.520]  this happened but part of this is your fault that type of thing all right let's talk about
[3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:24.320]  that investigation long statement coming up with our guest april gallup she survived her newborn

[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:04.000]  that make the show possible because i want you to be able to tell whatever part of the story you
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:09.600]  want you've told us up to this point then they start the quote investigation in the 20 minutes
[3:38:09.600 --> 3:38:14.080]  we've got left roughly run through then the rest of the story and boy is there a lot of it left and
[3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:21.200]  then tell us your take on what really happened on 9-11 being one of the victims of it well it's a
[3:38:21.200 --> 3:38:29.520]  long story because again it's been a long journey and we're still valid in 2008 and uh the investigations
[3:38:29.520 --> 3:38:36.240]  remain ongoing and because ever so many months during the medical evaluations the paperwork
[3:38:36.240 --> 3:38:41.680]  would get lost and so then we had to start all over again and begin the process all over again
[3:38:41.680 --> 3:38:50.240]  and so it stayed that way for for for many many years and then during one point in my medical
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:57.680]  eval there were pretty much explaining to me that it wasn't appropriate um to share that my son had
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:03.360]  been in the building that particular day and had gotten hurt and then i thought it was unusual when
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:08.160]  i asked well what in the world am i supposed to say who am i supposed to say you know was
[3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:13.200]  heard i mean what what in the world was i supposed to say and a lot of this incident
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:20.080]  incidences are so memorable because you wonder how how do you tell someone that
[3:39:21.040 --> 3:39:26.640]  or how do you come in a hospital with someone laid out and say this is what happened and never
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:30.720]  asked well how are you or when did you start to get suspicious about it not being an airplane
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:40.240]  that hit the pentagon well because i you know when i was finally told then i started asking
[3:39:40.240 --> 3:39:46.880]  questions because of where i worked this was the pentagon supposedly one of the most secure
[3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:53.360]  building in all of the united states of america and when you think about the budget the technology
[3:39:53.360 --> 3:40:01.680]  and things of that effect my rationale was how on one particular day nothing was functional
[3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:08.640]  and nothing was operational on that particular day i just was thinking what was the odd and then
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:16.880]  wow jet fuel you know then i looked up you know you know the jet fuel what the impact would be
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:23.600]  like and then i begin to question well how in the world if it happened how in the world are we not
[3:40:23.600 --> 3:40:28.960]  ashes well let's go back yeah i mean the plane burns up you're right in the hit zone but
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:32.480]  doesn't hurt you or you know hurts you but doesn't burn you up or or your son thank god
[3:40:33.120 --> 3:40:38.000]  uh... and then later they start trying to pressure you about being wrong even spot
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:41.840]  speaking to your friends and others about it before you're even really speaking out about
[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:48.560]  nine eleven itself being a fraud uh... did i mean did they start pressuring you to shut
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:54.480]  up or when you started asking questions what did they say about this well
[3:40:54.480 --> 3:41:02.720]  i started going public and then there were times where there were just particular comments being
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:13.760]  made as far as um is it wise for me to say particular things when i am trying to get through
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:19.920]  you know these investigations so that's how the whole military is they're always investigating
[3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:23.360]  they're always saying you've done something wrong so they have something to hang over your head so
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:29.280]  now they're intimidating you be quiet right because you're under investigation i mean it wouldn't be
[3:41:29.280 --> 3:41:34.320]  for operative it wouldn't be wise to just go up to somebody and say well you know if you do this
[3:41:34.320 --> 3:41:39.520]  we're going to do this it's another method it's more of it's a more sensible yet direct method
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:45.120]  like is it wise for you to be doing this while you're trying to get you know your medical is
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:51.520]  all your medical releases and if you just more or um we don't think it's appropriate if you
[3:41:51.520 --> 3:41:57.040]  discuss that your child a minor was you know in this particular area during this particular time
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:03.600]  um then they changed it and said well weren't you there letting him visit people and i said well
[3:42:03.600 --> 3:42:08.640]  now it was an inadvertent way of saying well why don't you instead of just saying well why don't
[3:42:08.640 --> 3:42:12.640]  you tell people you were there you know visiting us all around instead they say well why weren't
[3:42:12.640 --> 3:42:16.960]  you there letting him visit people and i said well how do you get inside the pentagon how do
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:21.440]  you clear your child to get inside the pentagon so she could show them off that's just not possible
[3:42:21.440 --> 3:42:26.960]  well let's go back now yeah you had said that nothing was working that day
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:35.120]  breakdown what wasn't working that day the stand down a pentagon security well i mean with you
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:42.160]  if you sit down and you do your homework and you look at the money
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:48.320]  that's spent when you go back and you go back maybe four years prior and you look at the
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:55.680]  department's budget and you look at the money that's spent so this building can be deemed the
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:43:03.200]  most secure building in all of the united states of america and then you look at how in the world
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:10.480]  was applying even able to get within a certain radius of the building now they admit they have
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:17.120]  missiles anti-aircraft missiles guns all of this always ringing it and then we know that day dick
[3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:25.120]  cheney ordered to stand down all right i mean so you have to say you know that leads to more
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:31.840]  questions you gotta understand you know everybody knows at this point that the official story was
[3:43:31.840 --> 3:43:37.360]  botched up they know the official story was botched up but you know there are certain things that
[3:43:37.360 --> 3:43:44.400]  lead to certain questions you know how do you spend this money um in this building and then on this
[3:43:44.400 --> 3:43:50.720]  particular day nothing was functional nothing was operational and this building the most secure one
[3:43:50.720 --> 3:43:57.280]  in all the united states was able to get attacked what's the probability of that
[3:43:59.840 --> 3:44:02.640]  i mean you have to really look at that i mean you really think about it
[3:44:04.560 --> 3:44:08.400]  it doesn't have a very high probability of something like that happening especially
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:13.760]  no i agree now now now give people a basic overview of your story what this led to lawyers other
[3:44:13.760 --> 3:44:21.200]  things i mean hit all the key points i mean when i was you know again we you know you know then it
[3:44:21.200 --> 3:44:28.080]  went to okay something's got to be done but i'm more of an effective type person i'm not more of
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:32.880]  just talk i try to find ways to get things done so the first thing was i want to try to find a lawyer
[3:44:33.440 --> 3:44:38.560]  but it was very hard because no one wanted to take the case then i started appealing to members of
[3:44:38.560 --> 3:44:44.960]  conga now that means take the case tell people what you had a case about i mean i mean specific well
[3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:51.120]  you know it wasn't that was clearly identified because here you had the official story that
[3:44:51.120 --> 3:44:57.760]  was saying that it was a terrorist attack um however there were so many questions out there
[3:44:57.760 --> 3:45:02.480]  that would lead you to believe otherwise and and and they were with a with a with a legal action
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:08.320]  and they were holding up lawsuit and with legal action you can get those documents and then you
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:13.360]  can put the pieces of the puzzle together exactly so you really start investigating all right so the
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:19.760]  purpose of the lawsuit was to try to obtain a lawsuit the purpose of it was the best way to get
[3:45:19.760 --> 3:45:27.760]  to the bottom of the situation is to litigate and have documents to penitent and obtain and then
[3:45:27.760 --> 3:45:33.600]  that way you can piece together what is true what is back this is what happened this isn't what happened
[3:45:33.600 --> 3:45:40.960]  yeah i've done that before you know it got you know one it was really hard to try to find
[3:45:40.960 --> 3:45:46.640]  attorneys who would take it we finally have two people now in 2008 um
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:53.520]  so we're you know it's been a long it's been a long standing we thought the commission was going
[3:45:53.520 --> 3:45:59.200]  to do something other than what it did but then that wind up being a disappointment um
[3:45:59.200 --> 3:46:05.440]  oh yeah 2008 uh we've had two wonderful attorneys which will come back probably another time and
[3:46:05.440 --> 3:46:13.600]  talk about uh pursuing litigation options um and that's over because that's how you're going to
[3:46:13.600 --> 3:46:18.800]  get the information well listen listen i knew they were taking down access tv on a smaller area
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:23.680]  and engaged in corruption so i just sued them for one issue to get documents on another and
[3:46:23.680 --> 3:46:28.720]  caught them stealing as i already knew they were doing and sent the guy to huntsville so but then
[3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:33.360]  it went up to a higher level folks in the city so they killed the investigation well only him
[3:46:33.360 --> 3:46:38.080]  going to prison john villarreal but yes you're right if you know there's dirt and then you've
[3:46:38.080 --> 3:46:43.280]  got one claim it's good to start a lawsuit to get in to something and burrow in it's you know it's a
[3:46:43.280 --> 3:46:50.080]  way to get in there and get the facts right now now now now let's be specific you were there
[3:46:50.080 --> 3:46:54.880]  you went through this have you ever had threats or intimidation after other than trying to go after
[3:46:54.880 --> 3:47:01.760]  your job or not you know give you medical releases uh you know all other key points before the show
[3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:06.720]  ends it was it was it was at you know after that and after the questions came after i said there's
[3:47:06.720 --> 3:47:12.880]  no way i could possibly say my child wasn't there um after you know i said well okay these are very
[3:47:12.880 --> 3:47:16.320]  valid questions because they were asking you to lie they were asking you to lie and say your child
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:22.480]  wasn't there they pretty much wanted me to say they didn't say lie they said it was it it was it
[3:47:22.480 --> 3:47:28.160]  it was inappropriate for me to discuss and so but they wanted you to say though that your child
[3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:34.560]  wasn't there though right yeah that i was there visiting i took him there to visit with other
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:38.400]  people and i said you don't bring your child so they wanted you to say that you'd basically
[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:43.920]  snuck your child in pretty much and i brought him there to visit with other people okay so so
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:46.800]  bringing my son to so day one you're in the hospital bed and they're telling you this is
[3:47:46.800 --> 3:47:51.360]  what you saw this is what happened and now they're trying to set dirt up on you and so you start to
[3:47:51.360 --> 3:47:58.000]  really ask questions uh i wasn't gonna say it so they you know that was it i mean the truth you know
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:04.560]  the truth i say the truth as i saw it from the perspective that i had and that's what i stand
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:10.080]  on and were there threats after that i mean now that you've been public for the last year or so
[3:48:10.080 --> 3:48:16.080]  are now longer just seem like you know it you know actually i've been out from the beginning
[3:48:16.080 --> 3:48:21.680]  i just was trying to find other methods of doing things that had a little bit more teeth to it
[3:48:22.480 --> 3:48:29.680]  we've taken up this issue since the january of 2002 and then november about november december
[3:48:29.680 --> 3:48:34.400]  that's when we started trying to get attorney so ever since then something was wrong i mean you
[3:48:34.400 --> 3:48:39.840]  didn't see a plane none of this happened you smelled a big fat dirty rat and so run over the
[3:48:39.840 --> 3:48:44.320]  high points i mean i mean run over the key things that have happened since then it was like afterwards
[3:48:44.320 --> 3:48:50.880]  uh a medical uh an investigation is only supposed to take 90 days from the date of the event so
[3:48:50.880 --> 3:48:58.240]  if that's from september 11 2001 90 days from september 11 2001 investigation part uh for the
[3:48:58.240 --> 3:49:06.400]  medical was not over until 2003 wow and then we and that was because every it seemed like every
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:10.160]  two months or close to the end close to the beginning of third month the paperwork would get
[3:49:10.160 --> 3:49:17.680]  lost and then we had to start all over again and then finally when that was done all of a sudden
[3:49:17.680 --> 3:49:24.880]  i would supposedly have uh um been overpaid by the department by the department of defense
[3:49:24.880 --> 3:49:30.880]  a certain amount of money for this period of time all of a sudden and it's in total violation of
[3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:35.200]  their regulation there's no way you would be able to go okay so there's all sorts of dirty tricks
[3:49:35.200 --> 3:49:42.400]  going on did you start to figure out that something was wrong right that evidently either i was on
[3:49:42.400 --> 3:49:48.000]  something or they were concerned about something that i said because of behavior it just all got
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:53.760]  very unusual and most of time when you see that it can only mean a number of things but again
[3:49:54.560 --> 3:50:02.800]  april when did you first start to think hey this is an inside job well i begin questioning about
[3:50:02.800 --> 3:50:08.800]  the end of november 2001 and that's when i began to find to go on a search to find an attorney
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:18.400]  um so it's not just you know uh you know starting a year or maybe people are just finding out about
[3:50:18.400 --> 3:50:22.640]  it but it's been a long journey i know you've been out a few years but i mean folks have only
[3:50:22.640 --> 3:50:26.800]  known about you for a few years because you were kind of within the system trying to fix it from
[3:50:26.800 --> 3:50:31.040]  within i'm gonna skip this break for info wars dot com audio stream listeners if you're listening
[3:50:31.040 --> 3:50:36.560]  to genesis you want to go over to info wars dot com and uh listen to the screams there if you want

[3:51:00.800 --> 3:51:05.760]  it all the facts fit with it the photographic and other eyewitness reports i mean this whole
[3:51:05.760 --> 3:51:10.160]  thing just gets stranger and stranger classic black ops shoot a missile into there and say it
[3:51:10.160 --> 3:51:15.040]  was an aircraft and have it fly low and the doomsday aircraft above but anything else you
[3:51:15.040 --> 3:51:18.720]  want to add or any harassment you went through or things that have developed along the way and
[3:51:18.720 --> 3:51:23.280]  where you're going in the future just other parts of your story that need to be heard i mean it
[3:51:23.280 --> 3:51:28.320]  good i mean it was still fighting the battle still continued we finally uh mr william bill
[3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:33.600]  and another gentleman is interested in taking the case but finances is always an issue so my
[3:51:33.600 --> 3:51:38.480]  goal is to try to see if people who are paralegals can volunteer their time to kind of help out
[3:51:39.360 --> 3:51:44.880]  if they want to help it with um you know legal funds i have an address where they could send
[3:51:45.440 --> 3:51:51.360]  you know funds to um and that's it we're going to keep fighting until the bitter end and so i'm
[3:51:51.360 --> 3:51:58.720]  not going to go anywhere um and hopefully you know if everybody gets in you know you know whatever
[3:51:58.720 --> 3:52:05.440]  they can because it has to be done and unfortunately you know the legal remedy will be the way to get
[3:52:05.440 --> 3:52:11.360]  certain pieces of document to get to what you know to come to the conclusion of this matter
[3:52:12.400 --> 3:52:18.560]  and we tried everything else um and now it can have to be done legally well give out your address

[3:53:26.560 --> 3:53:30.640]  i can't believe how we just calmly report all of this now it's just kind of like oh yeah and
[3:53:30.640 --> 3:53:35.680]  north com says they're gonna put combat brigades in the u.s to quote deal with riots and you know
[3:53:35.680 --> 3:53:41.040]  economic crises and oh yeah the the country's bankrupt and trillions of dollars are being
[3:53:41.040 --> 3:53:47.120]  given to the bankers and all in our name and oh yeah i mean it's it's just all getting so crazy
[3:53:47.120 --> 3:53:55.520]  right now and just pray to god to help us here we go final segment april final segment with
[3:53:55.520 --> 3:54:02.800]  april uh gallup it's also final segment of this radio show okay april any other key points you
[3:54:02.800 --> 3:54:07.440]  want to add and then you've got a legal defense fund address for folks that want to try to
[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:12.880]  or not even legal defense fund a exploratory legal fund to try to get in there and investigate
[3:54:12.880 --> 3:54:17.360]  uh what really happened at the pentagon people can say oh there's no hope so what hey all of us
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:21.440]  resisting in a million different ways it's going to bring the new order down but then i went in
[3:54:21.440 --> 3:54:27.760]  closing i want you to tell us exactly what you think happened on 9 11 go ahead okay again um
[3:54:27.760 --> 3:54:34.480]  um you know for those that are following those who haven't it's obvious by many of the testimonies
[3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:38.160]  whether it was by the could be done during the commission there are many contradictions and
[3:54:38.160 --> 3:54:44.480]  testimonial statements um the official story was botched up and you can't help but conclude um
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:50.960]  that there was a large amount of negligence and and an intentional act um on that particular day
[3:54:52.000 --> 3:54:56.640]  but again for us to bring a conclusion to the matter it is going to take legal action so we
[3:54:56.640 --> 3:55:02.000]  now have to now have to bring teeth to what we're trying to do and pull together strong legal
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:08.720]  teams so if you have paralegal skills if you know some good attorneys um please uh stand up
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:13.680]  you know and volunteer if you know if everybody has a sound on my voice they're made of five dollars
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:22.960]  that would be good you can send it to um attention elijah's fund e o i s h a comma s fund and you
[3:55:22.960 --> 3:55:31.120]  can put specifically legal if that's what you wanted to go to and it can go to 1 1 0 0 johnson
[3:55:31.120 --> 3:55:46.800]  fairy fe r r y road sweep 9 0 0 at lana georgia 3 0 3 4 1 um or you can call 1 800 9 8 3 6 2 2 3 um
[3:55:46.800 --> 3:55:54.640]  um regarding where to send um any other conceivable guests uh this particular fund uh can take
[3:55:54.640 --> 3:56:01.760]  any conceivable guests um but our goal is to continue in the battle um but legal action
[3:56:01.760 --> 3:56:07.840]  is going to be the best way uh to get the missing pieces of the puzzle okay well we can bring a
[3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:12.400]  conclusion to this matter bottom line you personally looking at it is 9 11 an inside job
[3:56:12.400 --> 3:56:19.440]  i mean when you say that in what respect well i mean clearly the official story is a fairytale
[3:56:19.440 --> 3:56:24.080]  yeah right the official story is botch and i do believe that there were intentional acts
[3:56:24.720 --> 3:56:31.280]  um on that day and i'm working very hard to bring that to a conclusion and get those missing
[3:56:31.280 --> 3:56:36.320]  pieces to the puzzle and in order to do that it would be wrong for me to make a final statement
[3:56:36.320 --> 3:56:41.600]  without conclusive evidence we need to get that conclusive evidence and the best way we can do
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:45.600]  that is through litigation well i don't think it's a bad way to do it i don't think it's a bad way
[3:56:45.600 --> 3:56:49.920]  to do it but i mean when you got a duck swimming around in front of you quacking in the lake you
[3:56:49.920 --> 3:56:55.200]  know it's a duck and the evidence is just unbelievably overwhelming all over 9 11 it's
[3:56:55.200 --> 3:57:03.360]  blatantly obvious um and i mean it's blatantly obvious and and i mean there's nothing else to
[3:57:03.360 --> 3:57:10.080]  say it's definitely obvious um but you know we've got to stand up and we've got to do something
[3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:15.120]  and we can't just let it die down and we can't just keep talking about it we have to put some
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:20.560]  teeth to uh i agree we've got to keep it moving or they'll stage more terror attacks it's absolutely
[3:57:20.560 --> 3:57:24.960]  key the fact that we have exposed it is probably backed them off a bunch of other attacks april
[3:57:24.960 --> 3:57:28.320]  it's been great having you on i'm glad you and your son survived and thank you for your courage
