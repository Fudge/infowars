[01:16.600 --> 01:22.600]  to pull out of Satocetia. The town of Gory still has Russian control, though the Russian
[01:22.600 --> 01:25.280]  presence in the town seems to have depleted somewhat.

[01:28.640 --> 01:33.460]  Suriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can
[01:33.460 --> 01:34.960]  be even more devastating.
[01:34.960 --> 01:38.480]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[01:38.480 --> 01:41.040]  I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaking is.
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.560]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[01:43.560 --> 01:45.160]  I don't want people knowing I have this to bear a sin.
[01:45.160 --> 01:47.920]  Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.

[02:33.480 --> 02:34.920]  Phelps too.
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.320]  Phelps helped the 400-meter medley relay team to win a world record today, collecting his

[03:52.440 --> 04:22.400]  The two spoke yesterday at a California mega church.
[04:22.400 --> 04:29.720]  Israel will free about 200 Palestinian prisoners as a goodwill gesture to the Palestinian government.
[04:29.720 --> 04:34.560]  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised Palestinian President Macron Abbas
[04:34.560 --> 04:39.120]  to free some of the 11,000 Palestinians held by Israel.
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.640]  Abbas's rival, the Hamas militant group, is demanding the release of hundreds of Palestinian
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.680]  prisoners in exchange for a captured Israeli soldier held in the Gaza Strip.
[04:49.680 --> 05:04.680]  The hairs should reach as an Israeli interior minister.

[05:17.000 --> 05:18.000]  world.
[05:18.000 --> 05:20.040]  No, I go home extremely thrilled.
[05:20.040 --> 05:23.680]  Torres ends the Olympics with 12 career medals.

[07:17.520 --> 07:22.240]  I come in every Sunday because so much news develops over the weekend building into the
[07:22.240 --> 07:24.000]  new week, first day of the new week.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.320]  We are here not playing the hooky for you, bringing the latest news and information as
[07:29.320 --> 07:36.920]  we track the criminal activities of the global elite also known as the New World Order.
[07:36.920 --> 07:41.920]  We're going to be going through a lot of really important news today and I want to take a lot
[07:41.920 --> 07:42.920]  of your phone calls.
[07:42.920 --> 07:48.040]  If you have any question, any comment, you disagree with me, you agree.
[07:48.040 --> 07:53.920]  You want to take me to task or want to ask a question about a piece of legislation or

[07:58.840 --> 08:03.120]  I will be here live for the next two hours and again we thank you for spending part of
[08:03.120 --> 08:05.320]  your Sunday with us.
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.920]  Our great listeners across the country listening on the AM and FM dial a growing list of wonderful

[08:24.280 --> 08:27.640]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday.
[08:27.640 --> 08:29.720]  Now I want to get into the economy some later.
[08:29.720 --> 08:35.800]  I also want to talk about the escalating tensions with Russia and quote the West and who is
[08:35.800 --> 08:42.280]  really behind kick-starting, re-kick-starting, reigniting the Cold War and also have a large
[08:42.280 --> 08:49.640]  stack of police state news, the surveillance control grid, the military surveillance apparatus
[08:49.640 --> 08:51.400]  being turned against the American people.
[08:51.400 --> 08:56.000]  So I want to go over those three areas, the economy, what's happening with Russia and
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.800]  of course Iran and now the police state.
[09:01.800 --> 09:13.280]  To recap what's happened with Russia about what 11 days ago or on 888 there was a premeditated
[09:13.280 --> 09:22.200]  sneak attack on Ossetia and Abkhazia, two breakaway republics that broke away in 1992
[09:22.200 --> 09:23.960]  from Georgia.
[09:23.960 --> 09:29.360]  Georgia in the caucuses on the Black Sea historically has been part of Russia going back more than
[09:29.360 --> 09:30.360]  300 years.
[09:30.360 --> 09:35.680]  That's where Joseph Stalin and many other famous Soviets came from.
[09:35.680 --> 09:44.400]  But in 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed several breakaway areas were predominantly
[09:44.400 --> 09:51.560]  Russian citizens, purely Russian and the Georgians began ethnic cleansing them and slaughtering
[09:51.560 --> 09:52.560]  them.
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.560]  This is all part of the public record.
[09:53.560 --> 09:54.560]  This is not debated.
[09:54.560 --> 09:55.560]  This is history.
[09:55.560 --> 10:01.160]  The United Nations force came in, made up of Georgians, Ukrainians, Russians, Poles
[10:01.160 --> 10:08.360]  and others and in the early morning hours of 888, in fact right at midnight, right at
[10:08.360 --> 10:15.480]  the start of the Olympics as a smoke screen, Mikhail Shaskavili launched a sneak attack.
[10:15.480 --> 10:21.760]  Now the sneak attack began with Georgian peacekeepers inside the military and police bases, inside
[10:21.760 --> 10:27.400]  the capital of Ossetia and surrounding towns, literally coming up behind the Russians and
[10:27.400 --> 10:31.240]  slitting their throats, stabbing them when Russians would run out of their barracks,
[10:31.240 --> 10:35.240]  they would be machine gunned by their fellow peacekeepers.
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.000]  It has now come out that the United States, if you can call it that, the people that have
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.040]  hijacked our nation, were directing all of this and that's all admitted in mainstream
[10:43.040 --> 10:46.640]  news just in buried in the stories.
[10:46.640 --> 10:52.920]  Then about 125 tanks, a bunch of helicopters and jets, as well as more than 100 self-propelled
[10:52.920 --> 10:59.040]  missile launchers, opened fire on the major towns and cities of Ossetia, tried to take
[10:59.040 --> 11:06.920]  a gorge going into Abkhazia, the other Russian area, and the peacekeepers that survived as
[11:06.920 --> 11:13.400]  the Georgian forces backed up by U.S., Israeli and NATO troops, and Herats is reporting this,
[11:13.400 --> 11:17.520]  we're very proud of it, so we got a lot of this from the Israeli newspapers, so is Wynette
[11:17.520 --> 11:22.600]  News, when house to house killing all the women and children, they would be begging
[11:22.600 --> 11:27.120]  for their lives, in fact the footage is all over Russian TV, all over European TV, not
[11:27.120 --> 11:31.120]  here in the U.S. our media is so controlled, and they go door to door to just shows the
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.160]  houses full of the lined up bodies of women, children, and men, they would just have them
[11:35.160 --> 11:42.240]  line up, shoot them up against the wall, 2,000 of them in one town alone in less than 12 hours
[11:42.240 --> 11:47.840]  they killed, anyone on the streets, they mowed them down, this was ethnic cleansing, meant
[11:47.840 --> 11:52.440]  to draw the Russians in, so that the media knowing, the corporate control media knowing
[11:52.440 --> 11:56.600]  our public so dumbed down here in the United States that they could tell us, oh God, look,
[11:56.600 --> 12:01.920]  Russia just snuck attack Georgia, oh my gosh, we've got to move U.S. troops in and basically
[12:01.920 --> 12:07.520]  have war with them, and it was purely, and Zbigniew Brzezinski who's now running things
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.880]  up there at the White House, and advising both political candidates, McCain and Obama,
[12:11.880 --> 12:15.920]  he had recommended in two of his books, he just published the last six years, the Grand
[12:15.920 --> 12:20.520]  Chess Board, 97 and another, so I guess it's the last 10 years, in the Grand Chess Board
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.520]  he talks about starting bushfire, starting wars in Georgia, Tom Clancy's written about
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.880]  how a war would start in 2008, you know, Shettia in Georgia, wrote that seven years ago, they
[12:29.880 --> 12:34.680]  loved to let you know what they were planning, U.S. troops began massing there in the last
[12:34.680 --> 12:39.640]  six years, Israeli troops began massing in the last six years, and they ran a sneak attack
[12:39.640 --> 12:43.960]  on Russia to reignite the Cold War, they've got to have an enemy to sell weapons systems
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.720]  to on both sides, they've got to have an enemy to scare the population into submission, and
[12:49.720 --> 12:53.920]  at the same time they don't want Russia to be able to continue to export its oil and
[12:53.920 --> 13:00.840]  natural gas to Europe and surrounding countries because they found oil and gas reserves larger
[13:00.840 --> 13:06.920]  than what's in the Middle East and Central Asia in Russia proper and its satellites,
[13:06.920 --> 13:14.120]  and so this is a major power shift, and so a sneak attack was launched by, and it's
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.480]  admitted now, U.S. special forces backing up Georgians with Israeli and NATO and Ukrainian
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.360]  special forces, a sneak attack, the Russians came in, pushed them out, pulled back up to
[13:24.360 --> 13:31.600]  near the border of Russia, they're only about 10 miles over the border into Ossetia, a massive
[13:31.600 --> 13:38.680]  escalation, a rekindling or a reigniting of the Cold War in a big, big way.
[13:38.680 --> 13:46.480]  Now if that wasn't enough, weapons systems, satellite systems, tanks, U.S. troops have
[13:46.480 --> 13:53.360]  been moving in to Czechoslovakia, to Poland, to Ukraine and four other nations, not counting
[13:53.360 --> 13:59.640]  Georgia, I guess it's a total of nine, menacing Russia, and Friday I read on air the official
[13:59.640 --> 14:05.240]  NATO doctrine, it's now public, and it says, our doctrine is to encircle Russia and launch
[14:05.240 --> 14:12.360]  a sneak attack, nuclear attack, we are publishing this to provocate Russia into World War III,
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.800]  we want to have a nuclear war with you, and I read that, and I had a top professor from
[14:16.800 --> 14:23.480]  the University of Ottawa on to read the official document, we posted it up on infowars.com,
[14:23.480 --> 14:29.080]  official policy, so when you hear it's an anti-missile defense shield, that's not what
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.360]  it is, these are short range missiles all around the borders of Russia, so that the
[14:33.360 --> 14:38.840]  West can launch a sneak attack, a sneak nuke attack on the Russians, and then they can't
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.480]  counter with mutually assured destruction back, what kept us from having nuclear war
[14:43.480 --> 14:53.680]  over the last 58, 60 years, I don't know since about 1954, so we're talking about 56 years.
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.680]  Where we don't nuke them, they don't nuke us, there's a balance of power.
[14:57.680 --> 15:01.880]  When the Russians tried to move weapons into our theater, into our hemisphere, we had the
[15:01.880 --> 15:09.360]  Cuban Missile Crisis back in 1961, well now the United States is moving weapons systems
[15:09.360 --> 15:14.400]  into there, so that Russia can't respond, and telling the Russians, so the top Russian
[15:14.400 --> 15:19.480]  general, Putin, the prime minister, and their president, all went on TV this week saying,
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.960]  please stop, they read our doctrine on air, and by our, we need to start realizing this
[15:23.960 --> 15:27.280]  isn't our government, this isn't our military, this isn't even our country anymore at the
[15:27.280 --> 15:32.520]  highest levels, it's been hijacked by the New World Order, and their general said, fine,
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.120]  we adopt your preemptive strike system, we understand your planning to launch a nuclear
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.800]  attack on us, we're now going to retarget the U.S., retarget Europe, and move in short
[15:42.800 --> 15:53.560]  range tactical nuclear weapons into that theater, and they did roll several nukes into the area
[15:53.560 --> 16:00.800]  of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, so when we come back, I'm going to read a story, a article,
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.120]  the Neocons do Georgia by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Wall Street Journal editor, former
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.040]  head of policy department of Treasury, father of Reaganomics, because he puts it best in
[16:10.040 --> 16:14.480]  just a few pages, and then after that, after the bottom of the hour news, I'm going to
[16:14.480 --> 16:18.960]  take unlimited calls today, except for the last segment, I'm going to air a few minutes
[16:18.960 --> 16:23.760]  of an interview I did with the awesome police chief this week, it was an hour long interview,
[16:23.760 --> 16:26.440]  I'm going to air about 10 minutes of it, stay with us.
[16:26.440 --> 16:35.400]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[16:35.400 --> 16:38.280]  won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[16:38.280 --> 16:43.440]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the
[16:43.440 --> 16:49.280]  financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[16:49.280 --> 16:54.520]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments, like stocks, bonds and
[16:54.520 --> 17:00.560]  CDs, yet no word about IRAs, perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your
[17:00.560 --> 17:02.880]  assets by keeping you in paper.
[17:02.880 --> 17:09.200]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237, don't get left
[17:09.200 --> 17:16.160]  behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments, call 800-686-2237,
[17:16.160 --> 17:28.560]  make sure that you secure your future, call 800-686-2237, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[17:28.560 --> 17:33.160]  It's a fact, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United
[17:33.160 --> 17:37.480]  States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never ending
[17:37.480 --> 17:41.880]  late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically
[17:41.880 --> 17:46.080]  impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[17:46.080 --> 17:50.440]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program to legally
[17:50.440 --> 17:54.760]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts which
[17:54.760 --> 17:56.880]  have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[17:56.880 --> 18:01.200]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[18:01.200 --> 18:03.320]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[18:03.320 --> 18:07.000]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.520]  eliminated their debt.
[18:08.520 --> 18:12.280]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.280]  around.
[18:13.280 --> 18:22.280]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600, that's 877-943-8600 or visit FDRS.org.
[18:22.280 --> 18:24.920]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[18:24.920 --> 18:28.920]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[18:28.920 --> 18:32.760]  Hi there, I want to talk to you about a dirty word, hangover.
[18:32.760 --> 18:37.000]  I know, I know, as the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets we hear it every
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  day.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.400]  Grown respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[18:41.400 --> 18:45.000]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about 10 too many at the frat house
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.920]  and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[18:48.920 --> 18:52.840]  These days, well sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes
[18:52.840 --> 18:56.200]  you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[18:56.200 --> 18:58.560]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[18:58.560 --> 19:01.680]  Well call it what you want, but now you don't need to get one.
[19:01.680 --> 19:04.000]  Just a drink and mate hangover defense.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.320]  Just pop one fizzy drink and mate tablet into a glass of water just after you have a couple
[19:08.320 --> 19:09.320]  drinks.
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.880]  They taste great and the patented guava leaf extract formula works while you sleep.
[19:13.880 --> 19:18.000]  So you wake up with no headache, no queasiness, no hangover.
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.360]  Look for the green box at retailers everywhere.
[19:20.360 --> 19:23.440]  For a location near you visit drinkandmate.com.
[19:23.440 --> 19:24.840]  Drink and mate hangover defense.
[19:24.840 --> 19:28.800]  It's how smart, responsible people like us avoid hangovers.
[19:28.800 --> 19:31.880]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[19:31.880 --> 19:37.520]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[19:37.520 --> 19:41.760]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients.
[19:41.760 --> 19:42.760]  Most of which are synthetic.
[19:42.760 --> 19:44.480]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[19:44.480 --> 19:48.200]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[19:48.200 --> 19:52.680]  coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and
[19:52.680 --> 19:53.680]  mucous membranes.
[19:53.680 --> 19:55.760]  Now compare a cow-bed and pure soap.
[19:55.760 --> 20:00.000]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.120]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[20:05.120 --> 20:08.920]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.

[20:32.000 --> 20:34.480]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[20:34.480 --> 20:35.720]  Well search no more.
[20:35.720 --> 20:45.200]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[20:45.200 --> 20:53.120]  All right, this report is from Creator Syndicate, hosted on infowars.com.
[20:53.120 --> 20:55.120]  The Neocons do Georgia.
[20:55.120 --> 21:01.160]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, a true conservative and true Republican.
[21:01.160 --> 21:05.920]  The success of the Bush regime's propaganda lies in deception with gullible and inattentive
[21:05.920 --> 21:08.920]  Americans since 9-11.
[21:08.920 --> 21:13.760]  It's made it difficult for intelligent aware people to be optimistic about the future of
[21:13.760 --> 21:15.280]  the United States.
[21:15.280 --> 21:20.000]  For almost eight years, the U.S. media has served as a ministry of propaganda for a war
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.680]  criminal regime.
[21:22.680 --> 21:27.640]  Americans incapable of thinking for themselves, reading between the lines or assessing foreign
[21:27.640 --> 21:30.320]  media on the Internet have been brainwashed.
[21:30.320 --> 21:35.240]  As the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels said, it is easy to deceive the people.
[21:35.240 --> 21:38.600]  You just tell them that they have been attacked and wave the flag.
[21:38.600 --> 21:41.080]  It certainly worked with Americans.
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.880]  The gullibility and unconcern of the American people has had many victims.
[21:46.880 --> 21:49.880]  There are over one million dead Iraqis.
[21:49.880 --> 21:52.240]  There are four million displaced Iraqis.
[21:52.240 --> 21:55.440]  No one knows how many are maimed or orphaned.
[21:55.440 --> 21:56.440]  Iraq is in ruins.
[21:56.440 --> 22:01.280]  It's infrastructure destroyed by American bombs, missiles and helicopter gunships.
[22:01.280 --> 22:05.720]  We do not know the death toll in Afghanistan, but even the American public regime protests
[22:05.720 --> 22:09.680]  the repeated killings of women and children by U.S. and NATO troops.
[22:09.680 --> 22:15.920]  We don't know what the death toll would be if Dick Cheney and the neocons succeeded in
[22:15.920 --> 22:20.480]  their plot with Israel to bomb Iran, perhaps with nuclear weapons, as they stated they
[22:20.480 --> 22:21.480]  want to.
[22:21.480 --> 22:22.800]  I would add.
[22:22.800 --> 22:28.800]  What we do know is that all this murder and destruction has no justification and is evil.
[22:28.800 --> 22:33.160]  It is the work of evil men who have no qualms about lying and deceiving in order to kill
[22:33.160 --> 22:40.680]  innocent people to achieve their undeclared agenda.
[22:40.680 --> 22:45.680]  That such evil people have control over the United States government and media damns the
[22:45.680 --> 22:48.080]  American public for eternity.
[22:48.080 --> 22:52.600]  America will never recover from the shame and dishonor heaped upon her by the neocon
[22:52.600 --> 22:53.880]  Bush regime.
[22:53.880 --> 22:58.840]  The success of the neocon propaganda has been so great that the opposition party has not
[22:58.840 --> 23:03.800]  lifted a finger to rein in the Bush regime's criminal actions, even Obama, who promises
[23:03.800 --> 23:09.960]  change is too intimidated by the neocon success in brainwashing the American population to
[23:09.960 --> 23:15.000]  do what his supporters hoped he would do and lead us out of the shame in which the neocon
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.760]  Bush regime has imprisoned us.
[23:16.760 --> 23:19.600]  Now, he's saying he's going to intensify it, just like McCain.
[23:19.600 --> 23:22.400]  They're all in control of the same people I would add.
[23:22.400 --> 23:29.000]  This about sums up the pessimistic state in which I existed prior to the go ahead given
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.640]  by the Bush regime to its puppet in Georgia to ethically cleanse South Ossetia of Russians
[23:34.640 --> 23:36.920]  in order to defuse the separatist movement.
[23:36.920 --> 23:42.600]  The American media, aka the Ministry of Lies and Deceit, again accommodated the criminal
[23:42.600 --> 23:47.560]  Bush regime and proclaimed the Russian invasion to cover up the ethnic cleansing of Russians
[23:47.560 --> 23:51.800]  in South Ossetia by the Georgian military assault.
[23:51.800 --> 23:56.560]  Only this time, the rest of the world didn't buy it.
[23:56.560 --> 24:01.800]  The many years of lies in 9-11 Iraq, weapons of mass destruction, al-Qaeda connections,
[24:01.800 --> 24:07.680]  yellow cake, anthrax attack, Iranian nukes, the United States doesn't torture, the bombings
[24:07.680 --> 24:15.000]  of weddings, funerals, and child soccer games, Abu Ghraib renditions, Guantanamo Bay, various
[24:15.000 --> 24:20.440]  fabricated terrorist plots, the determined assault on civil liberties have taken their
[24:20.440 --> 24:22.840]  toll on American credibility worldwide.
[24:22.840 --> 24:27.440]  No one outside America any longer believes the U.S. media or the U.S. government.
[24:27.440 --> 24:33.160]  The rest of the world reported the facts, an assault on Russian civilians by America
[24:33.160 --> 24:35.760]  and Israeli trained and equipped Georgian troops.
[24:35.760 --> 24:41.560]  The Bush regime, overcome by hubris, expected Russia to accept this act of American hegemony,
[24:41.560 --> 24:47.800]  but the Russians did not and the Georgian military was set fleeing for its life.
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.720]  The neocon American response to the Russian failure to follow the script and to be intimidated
[24:52.720 --> 24:59.000]  by the unipower was so imbecilic that it shattered the brainwashing to which Americans had succumbed.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.120]  McCain declared, this is a quote, I play this Friday on the air, in the 21st century, nations
[25:04.120 --> 25:06.720]  don't invade other nations.
[25:06.720 --> 25:10.440]  Imagine the laughs John Stuart will get out of that on the Daily Show.
[25:10.440 --> 25:14.360]  In the early years of the 21st century, the United States has already invaded two countries
[25:14.360 --> 25:17.920]  and has been beating the drums for attacking a third. President Bush, the chief invader
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.840]  of the 21st century, echoed McCain's claim that nations don't invade other nations.
[25:22.840 --> 25:24.920]  Total contempt for the American people.
[25:24.920 --> 25:28.000]  They know you're dumbed down, folks.
[25:28.000 --> 25:34.840]  This disconnected claim shocked even brainwashed Americans as readers' emails revealed.
[25:34.840 --> 25:39.160]  If the 21st century countries don't invade other countries, why is Bush dumb when he's
[25:39.160 --> 25:44.280]  done an Iraq and Afghanistan, and why are the naval armadas and propaganda arrayed against
[25:44.280 --> 25:46.760]  Iran about?
[25:46.760 --> 25:51.920]  Have two of the worst warmongers of modern times, Bush and McCain, called off the U.S.-Israeli
[25:51.920 --> 25:52.920]  attack on Iran?
[25:52.920 --> 25:58.440]  If McCain is elected president, is he going to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.560]  because nations don't invade other nations in his own words, or is President Bush going
[26:02.560 --> 26:06.400]  to beat him to it with five naval attack groups now in the Gulf, I would add?
[26:06.400 --> 26:07.560]  We all know the answer.
[26:07.560 --> 26:14.440]  The two Stooges are astonished that the Americans have taught hegemony to Russians, who were
[26:14.440 --> 26:18.320]  previously operating naively, perhaps, on the basis of goodwill.
[26:18.320 --> 26:19.320]  That's right.
[26:19.320 --> 26:22.600]  NATO's threatened to preemptively nuke Russia out of blue skies, so Russia's saying we
[26:22.600 --> 26:25.280]  may nuke you out of a blue sky.
[26:25.280 --> 26:29.320]  Suddenly, the Western Europeans have realized that being ally with the United States is
[26:29.320 --> 26:31.360]  like holding a tiger by the tail.
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.280]  No European community wants to be hurled into war with Russia, especially when 80 percent
[26:35.280 --> 26:37.880]  of their oil and gas is supplied by them, I would add.
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.440]  Germany, France, and Italy must be thanking God they block Georgia's membership into NATO.
[26:43.440 --> 26:49.200]  The Ukraine, where a sick nationalism is taken hold by funding by the Neocon National Endowment
[26:49.200 --> 26:55.400]  for Democracy, will be the next conflict between American pretensions and Russia.
[26:55.400 --> 27:01.720]  Russia is being taught by the Neocons that freeing the constituent parts of its empire
[27:01.720 --> 27:06.440]  has not resulted in their independence, but in their absorption into the American empire.
[27:06.440 --> 27:11.360]  Unless enough Americans can overcome their brainwashed state and rigged, die-bold voting
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.680]  machines, turn out the imbecilic Republicans and hold the Neoconservatives accountable for
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.080]  their crimes against humanity, a crazed Neocon U.S. government will provoke nuclear war with
[27:22.080 --> 27:23.080]  Russia.
[27:23.080 --> 27:29.280]  The Neoconservatives represent the greatest ever faced, the greatest danger ever faced
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.400]  by the United States and the world.
[27:31.400 --> 27:34.320]  He has no greater enemy.
[27:34.320 --> 27:39.360]  Now that's a true conservative former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former father,
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.920]  the father of Reaganomics, Ronald Reagan's confidant, a true conservative.
[27:43.920 --> 27:50.200]  The United States snuck attack Russia on the 8th, ladies and gentlemen, and it's all over
[27:50.200 --> 27:51.520]  the world, it's a fact.
[27:51.520 --> 27:57.800]  And the world sees Bush and McCain and Rice and Obama saying that Russia snuck attack
[27:57.800 --> 28:03.480]  Georgia and they're just going, oh my God, this is two off the charts, what are they
[28:03.480 --> 28:06.080]  talking about?
[28:06.080 --> 28:13.040]  In one city they killed 2,000 people in 12 hours, shooting everyone on the streets, going
[28:13.040 --> 28:15.280]  door to door killing families.
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.640]  And I was watching Fox News this week and they had Americans who were in Georgia saying,
[28:19.640 --> 28:23.040]  thank God the Russians attacked, they were killing everyone, we barely got out.
[28:23.040 --> 28:25.800]  And then Fox says, we have to cut the commercial and they come back and say, that's just what
[28:25.800 --> 28:27.920]  Russia wants you to believe.
[28:27.920 --> 28:32.200]  It's an admitted fact, I have to say the Austin American statesman got it right, admitted
[28:32.200 --> 28:34.880]  that Russia was snuck attack by the U.S.
[28:34.880 --> 28:38.240]  But it's not the U.S., it's the New World Order.
[28:38.240 --> 28:45.040]  And the dictator, and he is a dictator and they got Black Ops torture camps and secret
[28:45.040 --> 28:50.440]  arrested dissidents in Georgia and they have ghost sites where they kidnap people worldwide
[28:50.440 --> 28:53.360]  in Georgia, the U.S. does.
[28:53.360 --> 28:57.040]  He went on CNN and said, this is about the New World Order, we have to take down Russia.
[28:57.040 --> 29:02.360]  Folks, Russia isn't Iran or Iraq, they got 20,000 nukes.
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.680]  This isn't defenseless Arabs that we can kill and celebrate in their blood.
[29:06.680 --> 29:11.120]  I mean, this is like Napoleon attacking Russia or Hitler attacking Russia.
[29:11.120 --> 29:15.880]  The good guys don't attack countries, don't sneak attack countries.
[29:15.880 --> 29:18.720]  Russia wants to trade with us, not have war.
[29:18.720 --> 29:20.320]  We'll be right back.
[29:20.320 --> 29:27.320]  WorldWars.com has all these reports, your call straight ahead after the news.

[30:29.200 --> 30:33.280]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[30:33.280 --> 30:35.240]  energy and vibrant health?
[30:35.240 --> 30:40.160]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[30:40.160 --> 30:45.360]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[30:45.360 --> 30:49.360]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[30:49.360 --> 30:54.360]  Alkalizing plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping
[30:54.360 --> 30:57.840]  you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[30:57.840 --> 31:04.040]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[31:04.040 --> 31:08.680]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[31:08.680 --> 31:09.840]  of your body.
[31:09.840 --> 31:14.920]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[31:35.840 --> 31:41.040]  in a dive. He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach. Let's go look.

[32:38.280 --> 32:43.400]  each day. The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[32:43.400 --> 32:46.680]  in which we live is unable to remove all toxins.

[33:27.280 --> 33:37.280]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[33:37.280 --> 33:47.280]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas. Broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide. This
[33:47.280 --> 34:03.120]  week, the British prime minister, the president of Turkey, the president of Georgia, and a
[34:03.120 --> 34:07.800]  bunch of others have all called for a world government. They say only a world government
[34:07.800 --> 34:14.720]  can stop this crisis in the Caucasus surrounding southern Russia. And you go read the definition
[34:14.720 --> 34:20.880]  for a new world order and what the white papers from government say it is, it's a world government.
[34:20.880 --> 34:26.040]  And then I still get emails every day saying I'm crazy, it doesn't exist. And I'm not
[34:26.040 --> 34:30.680]  going to let the White House get away with the fact that two weeks ago it was reported
[34:30.680 --> 34:38.360]  on MSNBC, or we broke it, but it was reported later by MSNBC, that Cy Hirsch at a media
[34:38.360 --> 34:42.960]  conference said, well, I published a few months ago the fact that the U.S. government wanted
[34:42.960 --> 34:47.080]  to stage terror attacks on its own military to blame it on Iran. But he said, I didn't
[34:47.080 --> 34:51.400]  give details. Let me give you details. Dick Cheney wanted to paint up patrol boats to
[34:51.400 --> 34:56.400]  look like they were Iranian and have Navy SEALs come and attack U.S. naval ships. Yes,
[34:56.400 --> 35:00.280]  you heard me right. And that just kind of calmly got reported. Oh, Dick Cheney wanted
[35:00.280 --> 35:06.120]  to stage terror attacks that was overruled, who can overruling but the president. And
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.640]  people are still debating whether 9-11 was an inside job or not, despite the fact we
[35:09.640 --> 35:14.760]  have declassified government plans like Operation Northwood to stage just such attacks. I mean,
[35:14.760 --> 35:19.600]  I'm sorry. But people have been trained that patriotism is worshiping the government, not
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.120]  questioning the establishment, acting like the government's our friend and they're to
[35:23.120 --> 35:27.800]  help us. When I'm sorry, it's bankrupt, it's been bought up by foreign interest, and they're
[35:27.800 --> 35:32.840]  using us to build a world government and empire. And they're running it up on our credit card,
[35:32.840 --> 35:37.080]  on our dollar, on our debt. Okay, I said I'd take a lot of calls. We're going to take seven
[35:37.080 --> 35:44.200]  of them in a row. Starting right now, Zach, John, Matt, Matto, Al, Todd, Jonathan, and
[35:44.200 --> 35:50.640]  many, many others right now. Zach, in Utah, you're on the air. How are you doing? That's
[35:50.640 --> 35:53.840]  stuff's getting pretty wild. How are you doing? I'm doing all right. I just want to get your
[35:53.840 --> 35:58.520]  opinion on something in the book of revelations in the King James Version of the Bible. It
[35:58.520 --> 36:02.200]  talks about the seven headed dragon or the serpent. And I was wondering if you had the
[36:02.200 --> 36:07.040]  same thoughts I had that that dragon represents world government. And it says that the Antichrist
[36:07.040 --> 36:11.360]  we put in charge of the world government, and it'll be given the power to kill people
[36:11.360 --> 36:17.040]  who don't follow. Well, it says you'll be put over the 10 regions. And guess what? Under
[36:17.040 --> 36:23.240]  the United Nations, there are 10 world regions. You know, I don't get into things generally
[36:23.240 --> 36:29.280]  from a from a spiritual or religious perspective. We just cover the news and people can decide
[36:29.280 --> 36:36.520]  if that fits into scripture for themselves. But I have to say, it's pretty scary. Because
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.200]  yeah, Revelation says this world government based in Europe will get in a fight with and
[36:41.200 --> 36:47.800]  it uses the ancient name of Russia to then start this world world war and that will
[36:47.800 --> 36:53.840]  then kill what is it like a third of the world's population? Pretty scary stuff. Let's go ahead
[36:53.840 --> 37:01.080]  now and talk to John in North Carolina. You're on the air, John. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking
[37:01.080 --> 37:06.640]  my call. I just wanted to let all listeners know that the two breakaway republics in Georgia
[37:06.640 --> 37:11.760]  at Casey in South Ossetia weren't traditionally part of Georgia. They only became part of
[37:11.760 --> 37:17.320]  Georgia when Stalin incorporated them as part of Georgia in the 1920s. That's right. He
[37:17.320 --> 37:22.720]  was from Georgia proper. And so that was kind of a little hors d'oeuvre to his buddies from
[37:22.720 --> 37:28.800]  his hometown. He's from the capital of Tbilisi. And I mean, it's a fact. I'm getting callers
[37:28.800 --> 37:33.440]  on air on during the weekday show and an email saying, I'm lying. Russia attacked because
[37:33.440 --> 37:39.800]  people can't believe the media lies that bad. If you even folks just go to the AP and read
[37:39.800 --> 37:46.160]  their chain of events, the rundown, the fact sheet, it will admit that there was a sneak
[37:46.160 --> 37:52.640]  attack launched by US backed Georgian forces. But I mean, that's how evil our media is,
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.040]  is that the nightly news keeps saying Russia attacks, Russia attacks. Russia didn't attack
[37:57.040 --> 38:02.800]  anybody. Yeah. And people should also take a look at what happened in Kosovo where NATO
[38:02.800 --> 38:07.640]  went in there about 10 years ago, and they actually did ethnically cleanse the Christian
[38:07.640 --> 38:13.600]  Serbs. And then they just handed it over this year to the KLA. To the Muslims. Yeah, absolutely.
[38:13.600 --> 38:19.240]  That's an absolute fact. But in fact, we have articles up on infoawards.com, the famous
[38:19.240 --> 38:24.760]  Newsweek photo of the starving man at barbed wire. And they said, we've got to invade.
[38:24.760 --> 38:31.760]  And it turns out that was a UN food station on the Macedonian border there to the east
[38:31.760 --> 38:36.560]  of southern Serbia, southern Kosovo. It's Albania, straight to the south. And then right
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.960]  to the east, it's Macedonia, you know, formerly part of Greece. That's where Alexander the
[38:41.960 --> 38:46.920]  Great's from. And again, but Americans don't know that. They don't know that they use
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.400]  Muslim al-Qaeda. And this is admitted. This is a Senate report to attack for two years
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.800]  the Serbs. The Serbs finally fought back. Then NATO came in, bombed them, bombed Belgrade
[38:56.800 --> 39:01.720]  proper in northern Serbia, took over, promised they were never going to give it to Albania.
[39:01.720 --> 39:06.600]  And last year fully gave it to the Albanians and then mass murdered tens of thousands of
[39:06.600 --> 39:12.600]  Serbs with NATO led forces. Absolutely. Well, thanks for taking my call. I really appreciate
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.400]  your coverage of the whole situation. Hopefully it will be diffused. You bet. Thank you. And
[39:17.400 --> 39:24.280]  don't forget a few years ago in 2006, Slovomilážovic was in the Hague being tried for like five
[39:24.280 --> 39:27.520]  years. And they would never let him have a trial. And he kept bringing up all this.
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.800]  So they gagged him in his own trial. Then he was able to get messages out through his
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.880]  lawyer that he'd been told to basically plead guilty or they were going to poison him. And
[39:35.880 --> 39:43.800]  this came out in the news. Then he poisoned himself with a bizarre type of very rare poison
[39:43.800 --> 39:47.520]  and they claim it was snuck to him in his shell. He's saying that if they're going to poison
[39:47.520 --> 39:52.560]  me, if I don't say I did, did all this, the Muslims attacked us, please, they're going
[39:52.560 --> 39:56.840]  to poison me. Then they murdered him the next week. Oh, you're talking out. Oh, we'll just
[39:56.840 --> 40:03.160]  murder you. It's the same thing with Radovan Kajovic right now coming out. Let's go ahead.
[40:03.160 --> 40:07.280]  But you know, those are just facts. Who wants facts? Better just to believe lies, huh? Matt
[40:07.280 --> 40:12.440]  in Chicago. But remember, art, the government is not our government. It's destroying our
[40:12.440 --> 40:17.320]  borders, our sovereignty, setting up a police state here too. But people think patriotically
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.840]  just nuke the Russians. I've been hearing that nuke them, nuke them. These aren't defenseless
[40:22.840 --> 40:27.800]  Arabs, good old boys. And the good old boys can't find Iraq on a map, but they like to,
[40:27.800 --> 40:32.280]  you know, mad. There's some brown people. Let's kill them. I'm tough. Yeah, let's get
[40:32.280 --> 40:38.080]  tough. Let's nuke Russia right now. I'm seeing that all over the place. I mean, they got
[40:38.080 --> 40:45.760]  nukes folks. This country's in a lot of trouble. Let's talk to Matt in Chicago. Matt, you
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.080]  are on the air. Good afternoon, Alex. How you doing? Well, not too good. They just kicked
[40:51.080 --> 40:56.160]  off another giant cold war, but it's not cold. Yeah, it's terrible. I'm trying to convince
[40:56.160 --> 41:02.240]  my family and friends. Yeah, real story. Oh, they think Russia attacked them. They follow
[41:02.240 --> 41:08.960]  Fox News, religiously, basically. I just wanted to share two quick stories with you. First
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.160]  on the economic front and the war on censorship. This past Thursday, AP had posted a story
[41:14.160 --> 41:20.000]  in Chicago Tribune's website, breaking down the high inflation at the 17-year high. So
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.480]  in response to that being the Info Warrior I am, posted a comment on there with four
[41:25.480 --> 41:30.800]  links breaking down an M3, is no longer reported by the Fed. What the impacts of that are?
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.800]  Well, tell folks M3 is the outside the country money supply. Right. And so basically I broke
[41:36.800 --> 41:42.280]  that down and then I broke down the problems endured by the world due to the private federation.
[41:42.280 --> 41:46.800]  Oh, but you weren't allowed on a comment board to actually share info. Right, right. Well,
[41:46.800 --> 41:52.280]  the big thing is most of the people who posted comments in response to that agreed with me,
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.600]  and that was pretty surprising on mainstream news. But so throughout the evening as a typical
[41:57.600 --> 42:04.160]  narcissistic person, I frequently checked the... No, you want to commune and interface with
[42:04.160 --> 42:09.320]  other fellow humans. This is kind of the digital soapbox in the town square. You want to see
[42:09.320 --> 42:14.240]  what had been said. And let me guess, your links were taken down. Well, yeah. There were
[42:14.240 --> 42:19.240]  over 20-plus posts the night before I went to bed. I woke up in the morning, went in,
[42:19.240 --> 42:25.120]  looked down the Chicago Tribune. Two posts total the next day. Mine and all responses
[42:25.120 --> 42:29.080]  to mine were removed. Well, let me read the story you're talking about. Consumer prices
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.640]  rise at double the expected rate. Now, remember, that's at double their cooked numbers. It's
[42:33.640 --> 42:37.920]  really about... First note saying that it's three times what they report. Yeah, consumer
[42:37.920 --> 42:43.480]  prices shot up in July at twice the expected rate, pushed higher by surging energy and
[42:43.480 --> 42:49.880]  food costs, the latest surge, left inflation running at the highest rate in 17 years. And
[42:49.880 --> 42:55.400]  they claim that it's 5.6%. But every private firm and bank that analyzes it says between
[42:55.400 --> 43:00.320]  13 and 15. But I guess you weren't allowed to link to that. No, no, we can't let people
[43:00.320 --> 43:05.800]  know that. Well, hey, let the yuppies believe it's only at 5.6. The second story I want
[43:05.800 --> 43:11.720]  to get out real quick. Just notice on the cover of Time Magazine, the title, the cover
[43:11.720 --> 43:18.200]  magazine article is How to Stop a New Cold War, authored by none other than the Grand
[43:18.200 --> 43:22.800]  Chess Board and Mastermind's Big New Presents. Oh, he's going to save us? Is the world government
[43:22.800 --> 43:29.280]  going to save us? Got a jump. We're going to come back with more calls. Stay with me.

[45:27.520 --> 45:33.480]  Hey, since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and
[45:33.480 --> 45:37.720]  hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and forced tens of millions to go
[45:37.720 --> 45:42.120]  without food and water. After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.000]  begging for food. If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.920]  food, you'll be begging as well. Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald
[45:50.920 --> 45:55.040]  Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic. The U.S. dollar
[45:55.040 --> 45:59.520]  is worth less today than it was even last week. Before food prices skyrocket, trucks
[45:59.520 --> 46:04.080]  stop running and stores close their doors. Survival enterprises can help you prepare.
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.360]  They're master distributors of Mountain House freeze-dried food with up to a 50-year shelf

[47:28.600 --> 47:38.600]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[47:38.600 --> 47:59.480]  You can't say it's really a U.S. attack on Russia because the American people run nothing,
[47:59.480 --> 48:04.240]  control nothing. We have to realize that to get control of our country back. The government
[48:04.240 --> 48:09.520]  is completely bought and paid for by Fortune 100 companies that are offshore. Doesn't matter
[48:09.520 --> 48:15.080]  what issue it is, they ignore the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the will of the people.
[48:15.080 --> 48:21.160]  I catch myself in the psychology of we have attacked Russia. It's bad. No, the New World
[48:21.160 --> 48:29.440]  Order has attacked Russia and then told their mindless cattle that Russia attacked. I keep
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.240]  bringing this up. I've got a bunch of economic news coming up in the next hour and some incredible
[48:33.240 --> 48:38.240]  police state news, but we're continuing with your phone calls right now. Motto in Michigan.
[48:38.240 --> 48:39.640]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[48:39.640 --> 48:47.000]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex, or evening, so to speak. So many topics, a little time. Quick
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.800]  for the first caller. The last book in the Bible is the book of Revelation. There's no
[48:50.800 --> 48:55.400]  less on the end. It makes a big difference. The guy that was just talking about being
[48:55.400 --> 49:00.360]  censored, it brings up a sore subject with me. I apologize for having to bring it up
[49:00.360 --> 49:06.200]  to you on the air, but I've kind of exhausted all resources and trying to get some resolution
[49:06.200 --> 49:07.200]  through.
[49:07.200 --> 49:09.040]  We'll just make your point then quickly.
[49:09.040 --> 49:15.600]  I'm being censored on your message boards. My posts disappear almost instantly or within
[49:15.600 --> 49:20.480]  a few seconds after me posting. I'm never vulgar. I follow the rules. I don't know why
[49:20.480 --> 49:21.480]  this is.
[49:21.480 --> 49:25.640]  Well, let me ask you a question. Did we censor your call coming into the show?
[49:25.640 --> 49:26.640]  No, absolutely not.
[49:26.640 --> 49:30.840]  And we ask where you're calling from, what your name is. Occasionally, if I have a guest
[49:30.840 --> 49:37.920]  on about a specific, say, growth hormone and milk or mercury and vaccines, I will say,
[49:37.920 --> 49:42.520]  Hey, I want it to be about this, but that's a couple of times a week.
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.640]  Most 90 plus percent of the time, it's whatever you want to answer the question about the
[49:46.640 --> 49:57.560]  prisonplanet.com forum. We have a few moderators on there who are just taken from the people
[49:57.560 --> 50:03.120]  that are prison planet forum users.
[50:03.120 --> 50:06.960]  And I don't have the personnel. I have like 15 employees. That sounds like a lot. It's
[50:06.960 --> 50:12.160]  not two of them are administrative. Three of them are in shipping because I have an online
[50:12.160 --> 50:19.480]  video and bookstore at info wars.com. And so I guess that leaves, that leaves 10 people
[50:19.480 --> 50:23.160]  for radio video web.
[50:23.160 --> 50:28.280]  We had to shut down Ron Paul war room.com because some bug in it. If you go look at
[50:28.280 --> 50:31.560]  it, the site shut down. It's not there today. At least it was a few hours ago. I ordered
[50:31.560 --> 50:36.400]  it taken down this morning because some hole in it was allowing people to post porn on
[50:36.400 --> 50:43.360]  there. And I wanted it to be a user driven thing, but then we can't seem to stop that.
[50:43.360 --> 50:49.240]  So it's going to registration. They still just do it. And so it's so abused, it becomes
[50:49.240 --> 50:50.240]  a problem.
[50:50.240 --> 50:53.760]  Now, I have gotten a bigger office. I am going to hire more people. I don't know how I'm
[50:53.760 --> 50:58.080]  going to hire them to actually go in and take the, look, I've had the secret service out
[50:58.080 --> 51:03.360]  of my office twice and they're not mean when they come by my South Austin office. They
[51:03.360 --> 51:11.440]  just say we need the IP address of the person saying kill this, kill Bush, kill Barack Obama.
[51:11.440 --> 51:15.760]  And then the people start IMing me and emailing me, not IMing, sending me emails, posting
[51:15.760 --> 51:19.200]  on the comments, the secret services at my house in Michigan, the secret services at
[51:19.200 --> 51:23.720]  my house in Austin. Why did you give my IP address? Well, because the secret services
[51:23.720 --> 51:31.840]  come to my office and you can't do that as for people censoring you on there nine times
[51:31.840 --> 51:36.680]  out of 10, we have all sorts of server things going on because of millions of people visiting
[51:36.680 --> 51:42.400]  the sites. A lot of times you will post and it'll take a few minutes and you'll see the
[51:42.400 --> 51:46.160]  person start griping. My post hasn't come up yet. You're censoring and then it pops
[51:46.160 --> 51:47.160]  up.
[51:47.160 --> 51:53.200]  So, you know, I have never had websites until like the last year and a half where you could
[51:53.200 --> 52:01.600]  post comments because of the trouble it causes and because of the provocaturing. We've also
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.040]  gotten rid of some moderators and we've told a few of the moderators who were just volunteers,
[52:06.040 --> 52:14.320]  please be more lenient with people. And so it is what it is. Censorship in its classic
[52:14.320 --> 52:18.000]  sense is where they want to shut down the web as you know it and not let you have your
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.440]  own website. Or censorship would be the government coming in with the fairness doctrine and saying
[52:22.440 --> 52:26.920]  I can't have an opinion against gun control, against victim disarmament. I don't want to
[52:26.920 --> 52:33.040]  get into big treatise on this because I'm going to take a lot of calls today. But infowars.com,
[52:33.040 --> 52:37.800]  prisonplanet.com, the Prison Planet Forum are some of the most free and open places
[52:37.800 --> 52:41.920]  you're going to find anywhere on the web. I'm going to be honest with you. We had people
[52:41.920 --> 52:49.720]  going in there and saying kill N-word over and over again. So we did ban the keyword
[52:49.720 --> 52:55.440]  usage of kill the N-words. I mean, you know, there has to be some. You see because what
[52:55.440 --> 53:00.640]  happens is we also caught people with the same IPs, IP addresses, they would come in
[53:00.640 --> 53:05.120]  and say let's start killing police. And then they would post above it. My God, look at
[53:05.120 --> 53:10.280]  this website. We need to call the police. Alex Jones is calling for killing police.
[53:10.280 --> 53:14.200]  And then we go look at their IP addresses the same person. So you understand we're being
[53:14.200 --> 53:19.760]  set up here. So if you fall through the cracks and something happens to you, you know, that's
[53:19.760 --> 53:25.600]  just the way it is. I mean, if I get some million dollar donation, I guess I could, you know,
[53:25.600 --> 53:30.880]  hire a bunch of people that, you know, and had exact rules of what we do. But hey, you
[53:30.880 --> 53:35.680]  know, or we could just shut the website down. RonPaulWarrem.com right now. It isn't there,
[53:35.680 --> 53:40.440]  folks. Let me just check online right now because I got to lean over here to the computer.
[53:40.440 --> 53:43.880]  This isn't very ergonomic in the studio. Let me go to RonPaulWarrem.com and see if it's
[53:43.880 --> 53:48.120]  even there anymore. I'm sorry, the transvestite porn that was all over it. Just it had to
[53:48.120 --> 54:02.040]  come down. RonPaulWarrem.com. Okay, RonPaulWarrem.com. Oh, it wants a password. This thing every
[54:02.040 --> 54:05.800]  10 minutes wants a password. I can't even get on the internet here. Studio is like a torture
[54:05.800 --> 54:12.160]  device. The point is, is that that's the way it is now. Now look, they're in circling Russia.
[54:12.160 --> 54:16.920]  The economy is imploding. The dollar is imploding. All this is happening. And we're talking about
[54:16.920 --> 54:22.720]  the big bad, Alex Jones. Let's go ahead now and take another call. Let's talk to Al in
[54:22.720 --> 54:29.040]  South Dakota. Al, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Say, I just wanted
[54:29.040 --> 54:33.720]  to point out, I have two things to point out. The first one is it adds credibility to what
[54:33.720 --> 54:40.440]  you're saying, I believe, just to the east of Georgia is a country called Azerbaijan.
[54:40.440 --> 54:50.080]  And the website to take a look at it. Azerbaijan. And it's up. The website to take a look at
[54:50.080 --> 54:58.280]  it is www.usacc.org. And then click on the leadership and you'll see some people that
[54:58.280 --> 55:07.160]  are quite familiar to you. Zabretzky, Henry Kissinger, John Sununu, James Baker, Brent
[55:07.160 --> 55:11.960]  Scowcroft. That's just a few of the people. Yeah, there are hundreds of billions of dollars
[55:11.960 --> 55:18.560]  of oil, gold, uranium, national gas in these countries and these global corporations using
[55:18.560 --> 55:22.920]  our muscle are going in and kind of setting up their own little doctor evil kingdoms.
[55:22.920 --> 55:28.680]  They're building secret prisons to fly kidnapped Americans into. Exactly. And the second point
[55:28.680 --> 55:36.360]  I wanted to make, Alex, was on the last week, silver and gold both dropped dramatically.
[55:36.360 --> 55:44.640]  And this is on more of a local front. The price is being controlled. If you go to kitcode.com,
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.280]  you'll notice that they have a disclaimer on the top there that says they're having
[55:48.280 --> 55:54.120]  trouble because of the high demand. Well, anything that's in high demand normally rises
[55:54.120 --> 55:59.480]  in price. No, I hear you. I got a jump here on that note. I want to get to more calls.
[55:59.480 --> 56:08.920]  That's a good point, sir. Listen, this is a psychological warfare tactic that the social
[56:08.920 --> 56:16.640]  engineers use on us. Instead of having a national debate about was it right for us backed forces
[56:16.640 --> 56:21.960]  with us troops with them to mass murder a bunch of innocent Russians, we are now going
[56:21.960 --> 56:26.880]  to have a debate for the next year about who attacked first when it's admitted in all the
[56:26.880 --> 56:30.960]  publications at the bottom of the article. They'll have articles like Russia attacks
[56:30.960 --> 56:36.360]  Georgia and at the bottom of the article will say after Georgia snuck attack Russia. And
[56:36.360 --> 56:41.400]  so instead we'll talk about, you know, Alex, this will add credibility to your argument.
[56:41.400 --> 56:46.720]  It's like arguing. Arguing of the sun came up this morning, but they know we have an
[56:46.720 --> 56:52.040]  uninformed population. So then it just becomes a debate about who sounds the slickest or
[56:52.040 --> 56:57.560]  who sounds the most credible on the radio or who's wearing the best suit on TV, reading
[56:57.560 --> 57:03.840]  off a teleprompter, you know, who lies the best. The United States has been hijacked.
[57:03.840 --> 57:09.960]  It's set up criminal regimes all around Russia. They're moving weapons in and starting conflicts.
[57:09.960 --> 57:14.520]  For the two weeks before the sneak attack, Georgia had been shelling some of their cities
[57:14.520 --> 57:22.000]  and cut off the water supply. That's all an incontrovertible fact. But instead of the
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.000]  issue being why are the, why is the new order doing this? We have a debate about, does the
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.880]  new order exist or we have a debate about who attacked, who shot first? Because people
[57:31.880 --> 57:36.920]  don't know how to check. They just hear the nightly announcement of Russia attacks Georgia.
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.200]  George Bush says they better pull out. This is unprecedented. Countries don't attack countries
[57:41.200 --> 57:48.080]  and invade nations for no reason in the 21st century. Well, that's exactly what they've
[57:48.080 --> 57:53.320]  done. All right, we're going to talk to Jonathan, George, Brett and many others. The toll free

[1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:26.560]  prove to be beneficial. You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:37.160]  90KLBJ, Austin, Texas, it's five o'clock. I are in USA Radio News. I'm Jody Jordan.
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:43.400]  Church bells ring as Georgians attend Sunday's services in the capital city of Tbilisi. Secretary
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:48.280]  of State Condoleezza Rye says she hopes Russia's president keeps his word this time in honoring
[1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:53.760]  a cease-fire agreement to pull back troops from Georgia. President Dmitry Mcbedev says
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:59.040]  Russian soldiers will begin a withdrawal tomorrow. And officials are urging visitors
[1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:04.720]  to leave the Florida Keys ahead of tropical storm fay. The storm could start pelting parts
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:09.080]  of the Keys in South Florida by tomorrow. The National Hurricane Center has issued a
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:14.080]  hurricane watch. Deputy Becky Herrin is with the Monroe County Sheriff's Department. We
[1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:18.680]  like to get visitors out early so that if something happens and we do have to order
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:23.720]  a general evacuation of our population, then we have those folks out and can clear the
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:30.000]  roadway for our residents to leave should they have to. This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:35.800]  It works. It works. It works. It works. And what's best is it works from home. I have
[1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:40.200]  in the world, are you anyway? This is Andy Willoughby from the Threestepplan.com home
[1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:45.680]  business system. The dramatic difference with Threestepplan.com is that it does work. And
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:50.240]  after almost five years, I think that even the most diehard skeptic would have to agree
[1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:55.640]  there must be something different about the Threestepplan.com home business system. You
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:00.400]  see, we operate more like a mini franchise, so you get the expertise of people who have
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:05.320]  actually been successful working at home to help and guide you in operating your home
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:10.120]  business. It's kind of like a McDonald's franchise without the teenagers and big startup expense.
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:14.880]  And of course, we don't sell hamburgers. You do get to work with some really nice people
[1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:19.960]  who share similar family values. To find out how you can make more money working from home,

[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:35.560]  Swimmer Michael Phelps and three teammates are the winners of the 400-meter Medley Relay.
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:40.640]  It's Phelps's eighth gold medal at the Olympics. The lip-sync marks Spitz's seven gold performance
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:46.400]  in 1972. Swimmer Aaron Pearsall says he's glad to be part of something special.
[1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:49.960]  We're all very proud. I can speak for myself especially to be part of something as special
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:53.480]  as this and to end, you know, this wonderful meaning of such a high note.
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:03:02.880]  Through 153 events, China has 55 medals overall with 31 golds. The U.S. has 19 golds and 63
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:08.960]  total. In Barack Obama, John McCain differs sharply on abortion. In a televised forum,
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:14.920]  McCain said a baby's human rights began at conception. Obama restated his support for
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:20.680]  legalized abortion, but he said he would limit abortions in the late stages of pregnancy
[1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:26.400]  if there are exceptions for the mother's health. For more news and analysis, log on to

[1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:05.680]  Olympic veteran Derek Torres has won two silver medals in a women's 50-meter freestyle and
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:11.720]  the 400 medley relay. Torres ends the Olympics with 12 career medals. She says she takes
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:17.800]  pride in being a role model for middle-aged athletes. If that can help anyone out there
[1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:22.800]  to show what I've done and that you can do it, then I'm absolutely thrilled.
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:28.920]  Rafael Nadal captured the gold medal by beating Fernando Gonzalez today in Beijing. Here's
[1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:32.960]  Chris Bowers. Rafael Nadal has long since written his name into tennis history books
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:36.840]  for his clay court exploits, but by winning Wimbledon and now the Olympic gold medal,
[1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:40.040]  he's showing the world that he's a class act who transcends the vagaries of different
[1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:45.320]  surfaces. He was ruthless against Fernando Gonzalez, winning 6-3-7-6-6-3, a victory
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:49.080]  built around his phenomenal speed around the court. The Chileans' only chance came when
[1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:53.000]  he had two set points in the second set, but even if he'd won that set, Nadal was playing
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.320]  so well it probably wouldn't have changed the result.
[1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:59.520]  In a late fourth-quarter touchdown pass from rookie quarterback Colt Brennan, gave the red
[1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:05.720]  skins a 13-10 win over the Jets at Giant Stadium last night. Brennan connected with
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:11.640]  Jason Good for a 33-yard touchdown pass with 117 left in the fourth quarter to ruin Brett
[1:05:11.640 --> 1:05:18.240]  Farve's New York debut and seal the three-point win for the skins. Brennan celebrated another
[1:05:18.240 --> 1:05:19.800]  special occasion last night.
[1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:22.800]  Yeah, today is my birthday. I got to play against Brett Farve and throw a touchdown
[1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:24.600]  in Meadowlands, so it's a good day.
[1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:28.960]  I'm Jody Jordan, and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:33.960]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming
[1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:35.640]  a third-world nation.
[1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:39.800]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health

[1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:13.080]  We're back. Thank you for joining us on this Sunday. Now, six minutes into the second hour,
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:17.840]  the final hour, I've been covering the fact that U.S.-backed Georgian forces launched
[1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:23.720]  a massive sneak attack into Russian-controlled territories, violating international peace
[1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:29.440]  agreements from 1992, killing more than 2,000 people, and they have so much disdain and
[1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:37.120]  contempt for the American people, our government does, the criminals that run it, our criminal
[1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:41.160]  controlled media, that they lied and said that Russia launched a sneak attack. Just
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:46.440]  an absolute complete fraud. You can verify it's a fraud in about 10 seconds. They don't
[1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:52.880]  care. And the only amazing thing is about 90% of the newspapers and TV news shows said
[1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:57.760]  to lie, but then even on some of the networks, they would then later admit the truth, and
[1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:01.720]  a lot of newspapers admitted the truth. So they're not even getting their lies straight
[1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:08.560]  now because all media, even all mainstream media, is not lying. And that's a whole other
[1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:13.160]  subject, not just the sneak attack, the start of a new hot war, moving weapons into Georgia,
[1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:18.560]  moving weapons into Ukraine, Poland, NATO announcing it as a new doctrine of principally
[1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:22.840]  nuking Russia. They've been announcing this for two years. No, no, not that. It's the
[1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:29.160]  issue of how controlled our media is, how much lying they do, how dangerous that is.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:34.080]  I mean, that's tyranny, folks, when you've got lies of this magnitude. And what does
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:38.400]  that say about the American people that the elites would lie like this, that they would
[1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:43.280]  think they could get away with something like this? And what else are they lying about?
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:49.160]  Well, pretty much everything. They lie, they spin, they tell half truths, like no government
[1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:52.840]  I've ever seen. I've never been a fan of Russia, never been a fan of the communists and never
[1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:57.800]  been a fan of their corrupt kind of free market system they've got now. I'm not even
[1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:00.800]  siding with Russia, but the point is I've been watching the Russian news, reading the
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:04.560]  reports, checking it with other reports, and they're telling the truth, the whole truth,
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.720]  nothing but the truth, and that even freaks me out more, that they tell the truth. It's
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:14.120]  incredible. There's not even a spin involved. In fact, they've got the head of the Russian
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:19.600]  military is freaking out on TV going, what is going on? Why have you attacked us? Why
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:25.120]  is your media lying and saying we attacked your country or attacked one of your satellites?
[1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:31.320]  Why are you doing this? Why are you moving weapons up against our borders? And Ukraine
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:35.760]  is threatening to not let the Russian fleet land at the port that they've leased. I mean,
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:40.520]  look at this news I've got here. Bush, speech continues dangerous, brinksmanship with Russia,
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:46.280]  more threats today. Russian forces still entrenched in Georgia. Ukraine offers satellite defense
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:51.680]  cooperation with Europe, a telegraph Ukraine, inflamed, mounting east-west tensions today
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:57.520]  by offering a Soviet built satellite facility as part of the European missile defense program,
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:02.120]  which again is a sneak attack system is what it is. So the Russians can't defend themselves.
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:06.760]  Neo cons up nuclear war Annie with Poland missile deal. They're also in Poland. It's the type
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:13.920]  of news I have here. Let's go ahead and go back to the calls. Let's talk to Taj in Florida.
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:18.600]  You're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, how you doing, Alex? I actually want to talk about
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  the damn rather video that you got up on info wars.com. Yes. Basically, I mean, we all know
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:30.120]  the 9 11 commission report denied finding the boxes. The FBI lied about it. But I'm like,
[1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:35.640]  you know, I'm sure you remember behind the scenes. Um, Demasi and below talk about how
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:43.160]  they witnessed three of the black boxes recovered from the scene. Um, has anybody, uh, you know,
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:47.600]  you're aware of anybody who's tried to get these guys, you know, on interview or anything
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:53.960]  like that to talk about. Let me, let me fill people in because you are in the know you're
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:58.880]  informed. You probably know where the United States is located on a map. You probably know
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.400]  how to brush your teeth or wipe your nose. You probably have an IQ of above a hundred.
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:07.760]  But the general public, I'm sad to say, has no idea what you're talking about. And I was
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.360]  going to cover this near the end of the show if I had time. This really isn't a new development
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:18.080]  other than the fact that it's a new video clip backing this up. We have the photos of
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.960]  the black boxes that really orange with black stripes, three of the four. There's two per
[1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:29.960]  plane from the north and south tower. They were discovered, uh, basically undamaged firefighters.
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:34.840]  Giuliani, they held them up. They announced it was the boxes. They said we had them. It
[1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:39.600]  was in the news. It was in the New Jersey news. It was in the Philadelphia news. I called
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:44.440]  the two firefighters who later said, yeah, the FBI grabbed them away from us, threatened
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:50.280]  us and said you did not find three of the four of the four boxes. Uh, and so I called
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:55.120]  them at home about five years ago and this broke, you know, after the fact and they said,
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:00.000]  we've been threatened. We're scared. We won't come on your show. Uh, but, uh, yes, we do
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.680]  have Dan rather being told Giuliani's live at the scene, holding up the boxes. And,
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:10.000]  uh, he said, we're going to go to that in the quote feed cut and they were unable to
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:15.800]  show those boxes. So I do have that clip. It's up on info wars.com. And it's just one
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:23.480]  more piece of the ongoing coverup. It's unbelievable. The coverup is amazing and people just don't
[1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:28.120]  see what's going on. I mean, you got to be blind not to see all. There's extensive amounts
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:33.480]  of evidence. No, I hear you. I hear you. And that's just one, one facet of it. Uh, let's
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:38.920]  go ahead now. Thank you for the call. Jonathan in Fila, you're on the air worldwide. Hello,
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:44.440]  Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Thank you. I'm a five year listener and I've got your
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:48.880]  folks and videos and prison plant TV and Birkey and I saw that it's great. And thank you for
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:54.680]  making me historically and politically aware. Alex, basically I'm a tech Shopee, I guess,
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:59.280]  but currently committed pro-lake Catholic and not even want to call in and as a disagree,
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:04.200]  disagree or because I agree with everything you do stay. But over the, over the years,
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:07.680]  there's two things that kind of don't sit with well with me that I hear every once in
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:12.880]  a while. First of all, we just want to say before I get to them, I just want this question
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:17.680]  in general, I think is the root of it. Why would, in your opinion, why is this seems
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:23.720]  to me as such a disconnect between pro-lifers and Patriot movement, Patriot movement. And
[1:13:23.720 --> 1:13:27.440]  I learned a lot through you. 9 11 Second Amendment, Federal Reserve, false left-right
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:33.360]  paradigm or Iraq, media, my control. Sir, I spoke out on three different shows this
[1:13:33.360 --> 1:13:40.960]  week against abortion. I did. I did long extensive 10 and 20 minute rants about how we are an
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:47.560]  evil culture that's aborted 50 plus million babies since 1974. Roe v Wade and I have constantly
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:51.600]  spoken out about how it's part of a eugenics program and I've made a film in game that
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:56.760]  gets into the larger eugenics program and I don't know what you're talking about. Okay.
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:00.600]  Well, I didn't hear you this week. Sorry. But I mean, I do speak out against abortion.
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:07.280]  Yeah, you do. And I'm just asking the question, why would there be a disconnect? Whereas pro-lifers
[1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:13.040]  are more focused on contraceptive divorce against homosexuality against abortion. I'm
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:17.400]  just wondering in your mind, why is there seem to be a disconnect? I'm not sure I understand
[1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:25.320]  what you're saying. Okay. Well, coming from like a pro-life angle. I really don't understand.
[1:14:25.320 --> 1:14:31.640]  I mean, I just told you I cover all that. Okay. All right. Okay. No, let me say you've
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:36.920]  never heard me speak out against abortion. No, I do hear you. I do hear you speak out.
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:42.640]  And when you do, we do an excellent job. And my end game was great. I got into a lot of
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:48.360]  the years. Listen, thank you. Thank you. It's just, you know, I don't know what I can do.
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:52.840]  I mean, I mean, I don't know what I can do for people. I had some guy call me at the
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:56.720]  end of the Friday show and say, why aren't you covering Dennis Kucinich's impeachment
[1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:00.800]  of George Bush? I mean, I play clips on the air. I've covered it. I've covered his, I've
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:08.080]  had him on. I do everything I can. I mean, really, I think, folks, I'm not the one taxing
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:12.800]  you out of existence. I'm not the one devailing the dollar, the one launching wars. I'm not
[1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:18.800]  the one doing all this. And so the show really isn't about Alex Jones. I mean, I had the
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:26.600]  New York Times attack me Friday for criticizing Barack Obama. I'm not really here talking
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:30.920]  much about that. Most talk shows are making a huge deal out of it. I don't really care.
[1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:36.640]  I don't want to make the show about Alex Jones because that isn't going to wake people up
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:42.240]  and save this country. Okay, I want to make it about the news and about the information
[1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:48.320]  and the topics that we cover here. And I'm doing the best job I can, Jonathan. We're
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:57.280]  going to go break when we get back. George, Brett, David, and many, many others that are
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:03.840]  patiently holding, we are going to get to you. I do have some police statements. I do
[1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:07.160]  have some economic news. I'm going to cover it as well, but I'm going to continue with
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:12.880]  your calls in the next segment after this quick break. I'm not going to save you. A
[1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:16.040]  lot of people come to me and say, you need to do this, you need to do that. I don't have
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:22.640]  as much pull as you think. The solution is in the mirror. Look in the mirror. That is
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:29.120]  the solution. Okay, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:33.320]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt. But
[1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:38.320]  the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:45.960]  a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:50.480]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution
[1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:56.480]  called the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:01.000]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce. However,
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:05.160]  shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth
[1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:09.760]  in a stock portfolio. Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard

[1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:21.360]  debt. You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:36.600]  them to justice. Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy
[1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:41.680]  the destroyers. The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:45.680]  of the population of the U.S. Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and
[1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:50.040]  influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to
[1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:55.040]  justice. All nations will participate since they reside the world over. They are called
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:18:00.800]  Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order. They oppose everything that is God
[1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:06.200]  and truth. They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:10.880]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:15.880]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind. We will undo through the authority

[1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:58.120]  That's what happened this week. We called up the Austin Police Department and said,
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:03.880]  hey, we'd like to interview Art Acevedo, the police chief. They call right back and they
[1:21:03.880 --> 1:21:09.960]  say, yeah, he wants to come do it. He shows up just with one person in studio Thursday
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:14.720]  during the weekday show at my studios in South Austin and spent an hour with us. We're
[1:21:14.720 --> 1:21:18.840]  going to play about 12 minutes, some of the highlights of that hour long interview. The
[1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:23.480]  whole thing's posted for free right there at infowars.com.
[1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:27.040]  Now the reason I had him on is we reach out to everybody and he has actually done a few
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:33.320]  good things and some bad things. But he has been trying to interface with the community,
[1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:36.800]  very charming, very intelligent individual and he was telling me about the shows he
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:40.960]  listens to and how he likes my videos and I was asking him questions about the films
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:46.600]  and the TV show and he knew all about it. So he wasn't giving me a line of baloney.
[1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:53.400]  So that's interesting. That's coming up in the end of the next, the last segment and
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:58.720]  the last segment, some of the highlights with Art Acevedo, the Austin Police Chief. Let's
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:05.080]  go ahead and talk to Brett in Sacramento. Brett, you are on the air. Welcome.
[1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:13.120]  Hi, Alex. My question is, with regards to the Russia-Georgia situation and its connection
[1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:20.920]  to China, quite some time ago, a couple of decades ago, Anatoly Galitsin, I think, I'm
[1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:23.200]  not sure how you pronounce his name. That's right.
[1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:28.720]  So a Soviet defector wrote New Lies for Olden and Perestroika Deception and as you know,
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:36.360]  he predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, etc. And he also suggested that the Sino-Soviet
[1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:37.360]  split.
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:40.720]  It was false and we've had General Benton Parton who wrote the seminal war doctrine
[1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:46.480]  paper on the falsehood, the staged Sino-Soviet split between China and Russia.
[1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:52.160]  Right. And he claimed that even though that may go on for decades, that eventually they
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:59.920]  would reunite and form a powerful alliance. And I wanted to get your thoughts on that.
[1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:06.880]  Well, they did that two years ago with a new agreement. And so that's actually what's
[1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:14.280]  happening. I mean, that's the nature of power is that Iran's bad, the U.S. is bad. Russia's
[1:23:14.280 --> 1:23:17.840]  corrupt, the United States is corrupt, England's corrupt, Germany's corrupt. I mean, read
[1:23:17.840 --> 1:23:22.840]  the Bible, read history, read common sense. Usually elites get into control that are corrupt
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:24.760]  and bad.
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:30.560]  And so the New World Order, the corporatist as Carol Quigley, the top political scientist
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:35.960]  at Georgetown, Bill Clinton's mentor, he was the historian for the Council on Foreign Relations
[1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:39.360]  and the Royal Institute of International Affairs. These are the real shadow governments
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:44.600]  of England and the U.S. And he said that this banking elite funds both sides. And so they
[1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:49.160]  fund the conflicts to make money on both sides.
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:54.480]  And so it's the ultimate monopoly game. The difference here is this is a clear escalation
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:59.160]  by the West, by NATO, by the U.S. against Russia. I mean, I think Putin's a good guy.
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:03.040]  Now I've made films about how he was caught blowing up his own apartment buildings when
[1:24:03.040 --> 1:24:08.280]  he was vice president as a pretext to launch a war in Chechnya and to be brought into office
[1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:13.800]  in a popular election. So I just report the cold hard facts. Make what you want of them.
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:18.520]  It's not good for world stability to have this happening, this escalation with Russia.
[1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:22.120]  But that's what they need to then say, oh, we need a strong global government to stop
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:25.520]  this. And then they merge the U.S. and Russia, which is what they're politically wanting
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:29.960]  to do. So yes, there's a lot more to it. Great points, Brett. Appreciate you calling.
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:34.360]  Let's go to Bill in Michigan. Bill, you are on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:36.080]  Yes, sir.
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:37.080]  Welcome.
[1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:43.480]  I pray for your safety every day, sir. And I hope that we can turn this thing around.
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:49.760]  But one thing we got to do, when we get control of this, we have got to get rid of these people
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:55.080]  with all the money. I don't know if you got to kill them or what you got to do. But the
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:25:01.440]  Rockefellers and some of these clowns, if we don't do it, Alex, in a year, we're going
[1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:05.440]  to end up having it, or in 10 years, our kids are going to have to do it.
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:10.440]  Well, listen, let me comment on that. You know, you're saying, basically, arrest, get
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:17.680]  rid of the, quote, rich people. What the elites actually do throughout history is they go
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:28.800]  after. They always go after the middle class. They tell the poor people that the middle
[1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:35.200]  class is the elite. Somebody living in a one-room apartment making $1,000 a month or whatever,
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:39.000]  they think somebody living in a million-dollar house is a rich elitist. And that's what the
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:44.080]  big banks did in 1917. This is all declassified now. They funded the Bolsheviks to overthrow
[1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:49.480]  the Tsars and then the middle class under them to bring in a system to control populations.
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:54.360]  And so, we don't want a French Revolution here where anybody who's got any money gets
[1:25:54.360 --> 1:26:01.080]  their heads whacked off. We want to prosecute those that have engaged in crimes, and yet
[1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:06.680]  certainly confiscate their ill-gotten wealth. But we do not want some type of purge going
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:12.240]  on like Pol Pot, which the U.S. funded. Zbigniew Brzezinski, running this Russian situation,
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:18.600]  brags that he helped them kill 2 million people. The U.S. helped Pol Pot. And they killed anybody
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:22.480]  who had glasses because that meant they were middle class. Very, very serious. Let's go
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:27.000]  to another call here. Let's go to George in Florida. You're on the air, George.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.240]  How are you doing, Alex? Good, sir. Good to talk to you.
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:35.680]  Yeah, well, I'm getting ready to brace myself because of Tropical Storm Fay. And I was warning
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:39.920]  the listeners in Florida, if you've got a back way, take your guns, take your food,
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:42.920]  and have your burkies ready. That's right. In every case now, the National
[1:26:42.920 --> 1:26:47.200]  Guard comes in, if it's a bad hurricane, and confiscates your firearms, and they even go
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:50.120]  into high and dry areas and confiscate your guns. They're now using the National Guard
[1:26:50.120 --> 1:26:54.360]  to do door-to-door gun confiscation in Illinois, according to NBC News. All part of the new
[1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:59.960]  freedom. And yes, and I got to say, I'm going to grab my food, supply my guns, and I'm
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:06.200]  taking far away from Florida. How bad is that thing that's supposed to hit
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:09.400]  there? How bad is it supposed to be? Well, I'm predicting it might hit like
[1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:12.720]  Tarpon Springs, Dunnington, Florida, where the eye would hit.
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:15.840]  Well, I was looking at those, I was looking at those tracks. They've got them all over
[1:27:15.840 --> 1:27:19.400]  the place, yeah. Well, and the thing is, where I live, I'm
[1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:23.440]  near, I'm where the surge would hit. Yeah, well, you better get out of there, then.
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:30.920]  Let's go ahead and talk to BL in Texas. BL, you're on the air. Hi, Alex. Welcome.
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:37.720]  What have you heard about Friday night's countdown? Democratic strategist Chris Cofinas
[1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:44.520]  called for the Democratic Party to deal with Jerome Corsi using extreme prejudice.
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:49.320]  No, we have Dr. Corsi with the New York Times' number one best-seller, Obamination. We had
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:53.080]  one of the first interviews he did a few weeks ago. The New York Times attacked him for the
[1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:56.840]  interviews he's done with me, and I know I got attacked in the New York Times, but I
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:00.960]  was not aware of this extreme prejudice. For those that don't know, that is military
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:07.320]  terminology for killing him. Corsi was called the poster child for lies and smears who sold
[1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:13.840]  his soul to get this book published. At the end of the diatribe, with the guest host and
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:19.040]  Cofinas, the smirking Cofinas turned a serious face to the camera and called for the Democratic
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:25.640]  Party to deal with Corsi using extreme prejudice. Unbelievable.
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:30.200]  I need to look at that definition, but BL, from memory, doesn't that term mean violence?
[1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:35.720]  It's a CIA euphemism for assassination. Yeah, that's what they, that's the cover
[1:28:35.720 --> 1:28:46.600]  term they use. Right. From spinning the news to outright lies, 24-7.
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:51.840]  Now all of the mainline neocon followers listening, who now realize Bush betrayed him and was
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:55.800]  bought and paid for by the New World Order, get ready for the Democrats, and then suddenly
[1:28:55.800 --> 1:28:59.720]  I'll be the darling of the right wing again, the left will hate me. No, I'm the same yesterday,
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:04.040]  today, and tomorrow. We're patriots. We love liberty and freedom, and both parties are
[1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:07.960]  bought and paid for by the New World Order. 90% of the American people in Gallup polls
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:12.120]  want to control the borders. They say no. 75% would don't want gun control. They give
[1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:17.720]  it to us. 80% don't want a war. They throw it in our face. Anything else BL? I'll do it.
[1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:20.600]  Thank you. All right, we're going to come back with a blitz on the police state, the
[1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:28.760]  economy, and the awesome police chief in studio. Stay with us.

[1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:33.280]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[1:30:33.280 --> 1:30:38.160]  energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH
[1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:44.360]  level of 9 or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals
[1:30:44.360 --> 1:30:49.800]  and elements. This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness. Using plasma

[1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:40.920]  in a dive. He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach. Let's go look.

[1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:56.040]  them out. Let's see them. Oh, I'm so embarrassed. Don't worry. Now there's Non-X nail gel. Use
[1:32:56.040 --> 1:33:02.400]  it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic in sandals. Oh, I will, Non-X
[1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:10.800]  Man. Great. Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails. Don't let Non-X Man find you with
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:16.400]  unsightly toenails. Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X nail gel. It's
[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:24.800]  in the foot care islet, supersetters, lawgreens, CVS, Longs, Meyer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Sniders,
[1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:35.680]  Dwayne Reed, Bylo, and Rite Aid. You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication
[1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:49.320]  Radio Network. Okay, let me get into the Pentagon designed police state grid. Do you see the
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:54.880]  elite that put in electronic voting machines to basically cancel most major elections to
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:34:01.920]  control them? Northcom is now designated the United States as an enemy war zone. The American
[1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:08.240]  people are enemies of the criminal government. It's all stated in PDD 51 and others. Look
[1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:14.200]  at this Washington Post today. US may ease police spy rules. The Justice Department has
[1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:17.960]  proposed a new domestic spying measure that would make it easier for state and local police
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:21.720]  to collect intelligence about Americans. They're being federalized. Share the sensitive data
[1:34:21.720 --> 1:34:25.480]  with federal agencies and retain it for at least 10 years. Proposed changes would reverse
[1:34:25.480 --> 1:34:28.920]  the federal government's rules for police intelligence gathering for the first time
[1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:35.000]  since 93 and would apply to any of the nation's 18,000 state and local police agencies receiving
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.520]  about 1.6 each year in federal grants. So federalizing them there. Here's another one.
[1:34:40.520 --> 1:34:46.320]  We actually broke this. We are change Colorado for the DNC found the secret FEMA camp. They've
[1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:50.800]  built these in every major city in my 1999 film, police state to the takeover. We show
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:57.240]  you the secret camps. City defense secret jail. Oh, it's secret local police. It's secret.
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:02.000]  Just got barbed wire. Constantina wire. You sleep on concrete enough for 5,000 people.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.640]  Activist groups say the converted warehouse poses a threat to liberties. The city maintains
[1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:10.080]  that the facility is needed in case of mass arrest. The Democratic National Convention,
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:15.240]  the makeshift holding center dubbed Gitmo on the plate by activists is located on city
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:19.720]  owned property near Steel Street and 38th Street Avenue. When our reporters went out there
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:23.640]  to talk to them, the police screamed at them and told them leave. I can't have cameras
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:27.520]  in America. I can't have freedom. Newly installed security cameras guard the exterior chain
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:34.040]  link fences. A secret prison. Also operation Sentinel high tech police state takes shape.
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:37.760]  CBS News reports in New York, every car that enters on any of the eight bridges or any
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:42.320]  other roads in will be tracked and traced and your will be recorded your license plate.
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:45.240]  That's already been in nation while there's letting you know. Another report here. How
[1:35:45.240 --> 1:35:49.400]  big brother watches your every move in the ever growing surveillance society. The average
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:56.680]  Britain is recorded three times a week. So just a report on that for you. You know throughout
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:36:01.200]  history what kills what enslave what steals is corrupt governments and the founding fathers
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:05.600]  told you this history shows this. We have this huge governmental apparatus worldwide
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:10.120]  being built against the people and they say it's in the guise of terrorism. Now in the
[1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:14.880]  fake green revolution for carbon footprints to regulate and track your every move and
[1:36:14.880 --> 1:36:20.880]  tax your very air you breathe. This is the age of control. Corrupt elites are making
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:26.240]  a move and the people don't wake up and realize this control grid that's going in around us.
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:31.080]  We're going to get in a lot more trouble. On the banking front. I've seen a lot of different
[1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:35.560]  government reports coming out in the last year about how the majority of large corporations
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:42.440]  pay almost no taxes. And they don't get prosecuted. They don't get in trouble. Shmuck cattle American
[1:36:42.440 --> 1:36:47.680]  people are there to pay taxes and there to not have due process and have the IRS take
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:53.140]  your homes with no judge jury no due process. Daily mail US banking giant switches billions
[1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:57.880]  in debt to Britain to avoid paying corporate taxes for 60 years. Merrill Lynch might not
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:01.960]  pay corporate taxes for the next 60 years and emerge today. The giant American investment
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:06.120]  bank which employs thousands in the city has made the losses of 29 billion for its exposure
[1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:12.680]  to US subprime. Then it goes on to see how it's moved overseas. Dick Cheney, Halliburton,
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:16.640]  Blackwater, thousands of corporations are all leaving and they passed a law this year
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:22.120]  that American citizens can't take our wealth outside the country. Slaves come in they don't
[1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:30.960]  come out. One report there for you. Also Los Angeles program to give 2.2 billion dollars
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:36.280]  to Mexican trucking firms. Landline magazine to help them destroy US trucking jobs. The
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:40.360]  globalist want to create monopoly. See when things get worse in the economy, Walmart does
[1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:47.120]  better 70% profit. These are predatory. They're black holes. It's all about consolidation
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.520]  destroying free markets. We're going to go out the next five minutes with the police
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:54.960]  chief interview I did live in studio a few days ago and we're going to come back and
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:58.840]  finish out the show with some of the highlights of that in the final segment and full wars
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:03.200]  dot coms. The website here it is. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I am really excited
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:06.960]  and he's a really nice guy. I guess that's why he's already a major police chief in
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:11.160]  a major city as young as he is. And he's got a long bio here, but I thought that he was
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:15.840]  for the rest of the hour being very gracious about that. Art Acevedo, he is the Austin
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:21.600]  police chief who's now been in what close to a year or so. A little over a year. And
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:25.200]  we're honored to have you, sir. Good to be here. Finally get to meet you. Well, it's
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:29.960]  great to have you in studio with us today. Just out of the gates, instead of reading
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:33.880]  your lengthy bio, tell us a little bit about yourself. This is an international audience,
[1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:38.880]  obviously, not just in Austin. Okay, well, I'm 44 years old. I'm a proud father of three
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:46.160]  kids, a 19 year old, 16 year old and a four month old. I was born in Havana, Cuba. I've
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:52.280]  migrated to the United States. One of the lucky ones that got out of Cuba in 68. Always
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:58.120]  wanted to be a cop, became a cop, loved being a cop. And I did it out of a, out of a desire
[1:38:58.120 --> 1:39:02.200]  to really serve. I love people. I think being a cop is really about dealing with people
[1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:06.040]  and, uh, and if you can deal with people, have people skills, you can be very successful
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:11.640]  at policing. Now, obviously you, you've got courage coming into the lion's den here.
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:17.720]  Well, hey, I, I, I, I frisked you down. I don't see any weapons on you. So, you know,
[1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:21.280]  words can't kill you. I hope no, no, listen, listen, we've always wanted a relationship
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:24.280]  with the police. Yeah. And, and, and you know, I don't like the fact, and I've probably
[1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:27.880]  even been bad in the past bashing police too much. And that kind of compacts police
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:31.760]  into their own little culture. Right. Instead of having the public and the police interface.
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:34.920]  And I know that since you've gotten in, you've done a lot of things I've actually really
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:39.480]  agreed with some things I've disagreed with, uh, and, uh, really have been interfacing
[1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:43.080]  with the media, the public. I mean, you've got to be the hardest working police chief
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:47.440]  I've ever seen living in Austin, uh, for the last 18 years. Well, great. Well, thank you
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:51.560]  for that. And, but yeah, it's important. Look, we have nothing to hide. Uh, I really believe
[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:56.320]  that, uh, through transparency comes trust. And, uh, the more transparent we are, the
[1:39:56.320 --> 1:40:00.840]  more we engage the community. Sometimes we're going to have to agree to disagree, but, uh,
[1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:05.640]  and that's okay. But we have to have a dialogue because that's what's going to breed trust.
[1:40:05.640 --> 1:40:09.120]  And with trust, I think comes safety and a better quality of life for all of us. Well,
[1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:14.040]  there have been big changes. Also in the past, if Austin police shot somebody in the back,
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:19.160]  they would not get in trouble. Now that they have been getting in trouble. Well, you know,
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:22.400]  that you're talking about the Kevin Brown shooting. That was a tragic event for everybody
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:27.960]  involved, including the sergeant was fired. But the reality is, uh, we've got a column
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:31.440]  as we see them, you know, I know the community likes some of the calls. They'll dislike
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:34.640]  some of the calls, but I think if people know your heart and you know that you actually
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:38.200]  care and that you're trying to do the right thing, they may not agree with you, but at
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:41.720]  least they'll respect the fact that you're trying, uh, and that your heart's in the
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:47.240]  right place, which is important. Well, absolutely. And you've done some other things, uh, that
[1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:52.080]  have been good. And I've been happy to see police and the union not attacking you as
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:56.120]  much because they understand that if they don't clean house, uh, it's just going to
[1:40:56.120 --> 1:41:00.960]  be downhill. You know, and then, and that's true. Uh, the reality is we don't have that
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:06.320]  much clean and do with the majority of our cops are really hardworking, dedicated professionals,
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:10.840]  but it doesn't take more than one or two or three or a handful to really diminish the
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:14.920]  excellence and destroy the excellence in the bridges that we're building. I tell you what,
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:17.440]  we're going to break. That's a great place to leave it off. Stay there, sir. Back in
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:22.000]  just a few minutes with the Austin police chief in studio with us. Austin police chief
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:28.760]  art, Osaveto is our guest in studio. And now we can start the interrogation. Here we go.
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:31.960]  You like the interrogation room. We have lots of lights, a little bit of room. I like the
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:36.600]  padding, you know, so when you get rough with me, I know I can hurt myself too badly. You
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:41.560]  know, I'm surprised that, uh, you didn't bring a whole entourage with you because other Austin
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:45.400]  police chiefs I've noticed would normally have an entourage and then guys out in the parking
[1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:49.000]  lot, I've worked with a few of the radio stations doing my show out of there and like
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.880]  the police chiefs would be coming on other shows sometimes and you'd see guys in the
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:56.200]  parking lot looking around and okay, let's get into the tough questions in this short
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:42:00.560]  segment. We got a long one coming up after the next break. Um, plate scanning. Uh, they've
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:04.920]  announced all over the country, the feds have put in these license plate reading cameras,
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:08.360]  these cars are getting them. Uh, it's all part of this larger north com grid. You have
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:12.200]  the emergency management centers where they're bringing in the national guard, uh, threat
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:17.120]  assessment, threat matrix systems, this whole north com grid. Uh, the last police chief
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:20.680]  actually interviewed in person was the police chief of San Antonio, LA, Philippus when Delta
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:25.080]  force tried to bribe him and ended up in the paper to run covert operations in the city.
[1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:30.440]  Uh, your take on all that. Well, I think, uh, any technology, uh, it's not the technology
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:35.320]  that is bad or evil or anything else. It's the, how you use it. License plate readers
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:39.280]  are a good tool when you're looking for an amber alert, a partial plate on a kid that's
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:43.960]  been kidnapped. You can actually program that system. Let's say it's one, two, three,
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:48.760]  s a m. Uh, and now you have one, two, three, and it'll spit out any car. It'll identify,
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:54.360]  here's a car that you're looking for. So it helps us in terms of finding wanted vehicles
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:59.320]  and recovering stolen cars. Uh, with that said, if we bring it here, it's solely for
[1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:04.000]  our local law enforcement use and nothing else. But those grids, those grants are paid
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:07.720]  for by the feds. And if you'd like to give me documents, I can. They're also feeding
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:11.720]  into that within S. A. Technology. Well, I'm not aware of that. That's something
[1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:14.160]  that happened. Okay. Well, what about the gunshot detectors? They started putting up
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:18.640]  in 1998, which are really microphones. Uh, gunshot detectors. We don't have them here.
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:23.280]  We're very fortunate that we have a city that's a very safe city. What about the grants that
[1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:26.840]  announced in 98 that we're putting them in an East Austin? We don't have them here.
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:30.680]  I mean, if we have them, I haven't seen them or heard them. Every week, thousands of violent

[1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:36.000]  to you, hey, gasoline prices are going to jump to $5 a gallon, and I know a way that we can
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:41.240]  store several hundred gallons for you, a year or two supply of gasoline, buy it today at

[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:47.680]  game. And you'll probably at the time would have said to me, you're nuts, get away, you're
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:53.200]  crazy little dick, go bye-bye, and okay, fine. Now I'm telling you what's happened to gasoline

[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:43.960]  This is the GCN Radio Network. Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:48.960]  Art Acevedo, Austin Police Chief, is our guest for the rest of the hour. Very charming, devil,
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:52.680]  I have to say. We'll be watching you very closely from this time forward.
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:57.320]  Well, I think the feeling is mutual. You know what? You're a teddy-bear in person. I like
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:47:59.440]  watching you. I am a nice guy. You are a nice guy.
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:04.000]  I get intimidated by police that have been given federally paid for Darth Vader uniforms
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:08.120]  that aren't wearing badges. You were talking earlier about seeing video of me on the web
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:12.240]  or TV or something where I'm going up to the police downtown who are in their riot gear
[1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:17.200]  and I just wanted to see their badges. That's why I was talking to them.
[1:48:17.200 --> 1:48:23.120]  Let's bring up the big issue then. You talk about drunk driving and I've got hundreds
[1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.440]  of mainstream articles. I know you're aware of this.
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:27.000]  You keep saying that.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:32.120]  Well, because you're a smart guy. If you want me to pull you this up right now, I can.
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:37.600]  I'm just saying we document it. Claims I'm making are not claims. They're facts.
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:43.520]  Sheriff's, police chiefs, all over the country have said that they pull over a van and say
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:47.960]  with 15 illegal aliens in it. None of them have IDs. None of them have insurance. Some
[1:48:47.960 --> 1:48:51.400]  of them are drunk. They pick them up. They take them in. Ice won't pick them up. The
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:55.840]  judges in the city say $50 fines. We don't have any ID. We're letting them go. The famous
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:00.120]  railway serial killer killed a bunch of people, been going around for years, couldn't be caught.
[1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:04.520]  You talk about tracking things and having accountability. Citizens are having their plates scanned, face
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:10.040]  scanned, controlled, police everywhere, children spying on us in the schools.
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:14.640]  But then meanwhile, I know for a fact in Austin, Texas, I've had a bunch of Austin police tell
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:20.160]  me this and it happened. One night I pulled up at this office and I see two police cars
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:25.440]  and the life's going about a year and a half ago and I walk up and my IT guy, six of contractors
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:29.400]  in handcuffs, he goes, oh yeah, my license expired. I haven't got it renewed. And they
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:33.080]  said, yep, we're just having to arrest him. And I said, and then it turned out the cops
[1:49:33.080 --> 1:49:36.440]  kind of bowled up when I first pulled up and they said, oh, Alex Jones, how you doing?
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.760]  We're fans of the show. But then they went ahead and said, oh, we got to arrest him.
[1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:41.760]  And I said, but if he was an illegal alien, you probably wouldn't. And he says, you know
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:45.880]  what, they just let him go and we're not encouraged to do it. And Austin's a sanctuary
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:51.480]  city. Now, and so, so, so what do you say to that claiming drunk drivers when statistically
[1:49:51.480 --> 1:49:54.520]  you talk about Austin being hard drinking, we know folks from south of the border are
[1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:58.880]  hard drinking too, just like Texans. Well, look, what I've been talking about this
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:04.480]  on Spanish media and Spanish radio and it's from the day I got here. If you commit a crime
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:08.560]  in the city, if you commit a violation, I don't care if you're legal or illegal, we're
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:12.880]  going to enforce the law. That is our job. And this wasn't a year and a half ago, but
[1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:15.560]  why did the officers tell me they weren't supposed to arrest him a year and a half ago?
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:19.200]  You know what? Some of it may be their own self-perception, their own perception. The
[1:50:19.200 --> 1:50:23.760]  reality is when we take enforcement action, we base it on the statutes and the ordinances
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:28.040]  in the city without regard to socioeconomic standing. Is this a sanctuary city? It's
[1:50:28.040 --> 1:50:31.520]  listed as one. This is not a sanctuary city because when we
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:36.400]  booked people at the jail, ICE has access to the jail. They don't come, do they? What
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:41.040]  do you do when you don't know who somebody is and there's been a stabbing and you've
[1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:46.720]  got three witnesses and it's hard to prosecute because nobody knows who these people are.
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:50.640]  And then also then that victimizes these communities because they're lawless. Well, absolutely
[1:50:50.640 --> 1:50:56.960]  because we have, there's two things that are happening. First of all, immigration control
[1:50:56.960 --> 1:51:00.360]  starts at the border. You've got to secure your borders. I think that most major city
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:04.800]  chiefs, that is actually a policy position on major city chiefs here in the country is
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:08.720]  that we've got to secure our borders. The second part though is that we have to be
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:13.640]  serious about it because here's the unintended consequence. If I become, actually it's an
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:18.320]  unfounded mandate for me to be doing ICE's work or immigration's work, but here's the
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:25.880]  problem. If it is a revolving door where three days after you get them, if we became an arm
[1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:30.600]  of immigration, they're going to be right back. What can happen is that we lose the
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:35.080]  trust of that community. It's going to be here and we lose witnesses, we lose victims
[1:51:35.080 --> 1:51:40.840]  and we all lose. I have friends that work for the federal government in Southern California
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:46.840]  that used to be frustrated that they'd take people down on the bus and the joke was that
[1:51:46.840 --> 1:51:49.200]  the people that were deported beat the bus back.
[1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:54.640]  Well, they also, they also killed police, federal police. They commit murders and Mexico
[1:51:54.640 --> 1:51:58.960]  will not extra die back to the US if there's a death penalty. So I mean, this is literally
[1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:02.640]  like the Wild West. You know about the rocket attacks in Nuevo Laredo. You know about the
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:07.560]  truck bomb in Dallas. You know about Los Zetas paramilitary Mexican troops are now, and I
[1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:12.600]  reported this three years before it hit the mainstream, are now carrying operations. The
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:17.920]  police are scared of them. MS 13. I mean, it's, and then meanwhile, my guy's got an
[1:52:17.920 --> 1:52:19.600]  expired license. He's off to jail.
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:24.560]  Well, again, our official position here is that if you break the law, if you violate
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:27.920]  the law, we're going to treat you the same way that you're legally illegal. You're going
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:28.920]  to go to jail.
[1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:31.600]  So what do you do when you pull an illegal alien over who's driving a car and they don't
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:35.200]  have insurance? I mean, how do you write them a ticket if you don't know who they are?
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:39.360]  Well, if you know, if you cannot reasonably identify who a person is, then you take them
[1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:41.400]  forthwith to get them identified.
[1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:44.920]  So you are taking people to jail who you don't know who they are.
[1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:49.680]  Our policy allows our officers that if you cannot identify a person, then you can go
[1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:50.680]  forthwith.
[1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:54.880]  See, that's their discretion. You can go forth. I mean, yeah, the police are encouraged
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:59.040]  to go out and write tickets and generate revenue on the almost broke back city, even though
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:04.000]  we're a wealthy city. But meanwhile, you see, I mean, look, look, let's be honest, chief.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:08.240]  You know, and I know there's a double standard. There's a double standard to 867 sanctuary
[1:53:08.240 --> 1:53:13.240]  cities and Austin is on the map as one of the worst in the country after LA Denver, Chicago.
[1:53:13.240 --> 1:53:17.240]  We got a Mexican, you know, consulate our mission here, which hands out these cracker
[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:23.200]  jack, uh, uh, the consular, uh, particular. Yeah. I mean, I had the leader of the Republican
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:28.040]  Senate, uh, in, uh, on a few years ago, he, he and one day himself went and got four fake
[1:53:28.040 --> 1:53:29.640]  IDs from Mexican consulate.
[1:53:29.640 --> 1:53:34.120]  Well, it is a challenge, but you know, the problem for us and this as police officers
[1:53:34.120 --> 1:53:39.680]  at the local level is policing a community that we know is here and policing a community
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:45.720]  that, uh, you know, we don't control the borders. We have to control what's in our city. Uh,
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:50.280]  and I think some of the frustration is that the reality is the way that you deal with
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:55.000]  immigration is you dry up jobs, you dry up some of those opportunities. Uh, people wouldn't
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  come here illegally.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.800]  And to me, that's, if you're going to get serious, that's where you start is with employers.
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:05.000]  Oh, I agree. I am for throwing them in plus just as a citizen, I want people to be able
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:09.160]  to have entry level jobs. No matter what color they are, we've got hundreds of millions
[1:54:09.160 --> 1:54:11.160]  of people that want to come here.
[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:14.760]  What if there was a huge terror attack, uh, somewhere in the United States and they said
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:19.800]  that we have to implement PDD 51, basically making the president a dictator. Uh, what
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:23.280]  would you do then if they told you, you know, gave you a list and they have these been the
[1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:27.520]  Houston Chronicle now of, uh, 3000 Austin nights to be picked up and Alex Jones is
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:31.880]  on there and there's no judge, no jury, no indictment, no grand jury. It's just go pick
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:32.880]  up Alex Jones.
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:37.440]  Well, we'd say Alex Jones. We know him. We're going to vouch for him. But, uh, the reality
[1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:41.240]  is, uh, we'll, we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Uh, you'll cross the bridge
[1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:46.760]  to follow it out to figure out what, uh, if it's a lawful order, uh, and, uh, we'll make
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:48.800]  that decision based on what we know to be right.
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:53.160]  I mean, we got the city to throw out the Patriot actor locally, you know, to say that we oppose
[1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:54.160]  it.
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:57.920]  But you know, I'll mind just remember we, we are a local police department. We are a
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:03.960]  separate entity, uh, and we will operate based upon, uh, what our own city statutes are and
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:08.160]  our requirements are. And I think that's what would be, but we know that, that, that they've
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:12.480]  trained the police to drive the buses and pick up people during riots. And we know they have
[1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:15.880]  the emergency center out at the old airport, the overflow center. Is that still there with
[1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:17.520]  the Bolton chains on the floor?
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:18.880]  I haven't seen it since I've been here.
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:23.080]  I mean, are you aware of that there's a Bolton change where the little FEMA camp they've
[1:55:23.080 --> 1:55:24.440]  got at the old Mueller airport?
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:25.440]  I haven't seen it.
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:26.440]  You went to the old airport.
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  But you know what, the old airport, I think that's pretty much, uh, been, uh, privatized.
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:30.440]  Yeah.
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:31.440]  Yeah.
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:34.440]  Let's see what's staying there. One minute break, chief.
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:52.440]  Well, I have been interrogating him, and I'd like to give him the last five minutes.
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:58.160]  Awesome. Police chief aren't a Savado to talk about whatever he thinks is most important
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:01.400]  to get out on the websites or any points he's making. I would like to see other police chiefs
[1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:08.160]  across the country where we're on in Chicago, LA, San Diego, Kansas city, uh, other places.
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:11.600]  If you want to come on this show, you are welcome. Uh, we'd love to hear from you here
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:15.360]  as well, because one thing that'll fight tyranny is the people truly being involved in their
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:19.640]  government and being friends with the police, but not a spy way, but in a, you know, in
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:23.120]  the way you're doing it. Uh, and so it, it humanizes both sides.
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:29.320]  Well, I, yeah, and I think, uh, familiarity, uh, breeds, uh, trust and respect. And, uh,
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:32.760]  the reality is at least we know each other's positions and we don't have to get in everything,
[1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:36.080]  but we can agree to disagree. Uh, please don't take me to the Famer Camp.
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:40.760]  No, we have a special lockup for you. I'm kidding. Uh, trust me, we don't have any black
[1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:44.240]  helicopters falling around. I only have one helicopter for God's sakes. I'm trying to
[1:56:44.240 --> 1:56:47.760]  get a second. Uh, but the reality is it buzzes my house daily.
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:52.120]  That must be tank. One of our, uh, guys with good sense of humor. The reality is we have
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:56.080]  a great police department here in Austin. We live in a great city. Our goal though is
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:00.720]  that we don't want to be naive to think that, uh, uh, things can't worsen for us in terms
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:04.960]  of crime. If we don't stay on top of it, we want to be proactive. We want to be aggressive,
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:09.040]  uh, but we want to be respectful of people's rights. And, uh, most importantly, we want
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:12.880]  to make sure that everybody's treated the same and equally. Ultimately, no matter whatever
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:16.840]  happens in this city that impacts public safety, the federal government isn't going to answer
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:21.520]  to that. The state isn't going to answer to that. The chief of police of Austin, Texas
[1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:26.080]  is going to answer to Austin ice because I worked for them, uh, and there is no excuse.
[1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:30.320]  We have to stay on top of issues, but know this. We are here to serve. We have nothing
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:34.560]  to hide. We're a transparent organization, uh, and we're not afraid to answer the tough
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:37.640]  question. I have said this. Things have changed since you've been here. We're seeing changes
[1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:41.200]  everywhere, but I just want you to realize those governing the federal government do
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:45.280]  not have the same altruistic goals of you. I will assure you. I mean, look at all the
[1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:48.640]  chemical and biological, radiological testing they've done on the American people. Do you
[1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:52.200]  know about Tuskegee and all that? I mean, the point is, let's stop completely trusting
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:56.880]  government as well. Let's get involved in government. All right, folks. So there's
[1:57:56.880 --> 1:58:02.440]  like 45 minutes more of it up on info wars.com. I am out of time. Back next Sunday, four to
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:07.640]  six p.m. Central five to seven Eastern. I want to thank all the affiliate sponsors,
