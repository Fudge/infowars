[00:00.000 --> 00:01.020]  In the conditioning!
[00:01.020 --> 00:02.180]  Info Wars comes to mind.
[00:02.180 --> 00:02.980]  Alex Jones.
[00:02.980 --> 00:03.780]  Alex Jones.
[00:03.780 --> 00:04.580]  Alex Jones.
[00:04.580 --> 00:07.580]  But there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:07.580 --> 00:12.420]  For Google it's been accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign,
[00:12.420 --> 00:17.100]  but changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:17.100 --> 00:18.940]  That's according to website Info Wars.
[00:18.940 --> 00:22.700]  It's currently confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[00:22.700 --> 00:24.140]  Automatic action is on fire!
[00:24.140 --> 00:28.380]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death and messed with Tennessee.
[00:28.380 --> 00:31.580]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:31.580 --> 00:36.380]  It was almost a district where a planned impulsion hit just hanging.
[00:36.380 --> 00:38.540]  They took the babies out of the incubators.
[00:38.540 --> 00:40.940]  They left the children to die on the cold floor.
[00:40.940 --> 00:43.420]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[00:43.420 --> 00:47.340]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work,
[00:47.340 --> 00:50.620]  operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:50.620 --> 00:51.740]  USA.
[00:51.740 --> 00:53.980]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:53.980 --> 00:56.380]  Is it one world the central bank has been charged?
[00:56.380 --> 00:58.620]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:58.620 --> 01:01.900]  Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:01.900 --> 01:05.420]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[01:05.420 --> 01:11.020]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:11.020 --> 01:12.540]  Russian scum!
[01:12.540 --> 01:14.860]  Denied everything. He called it all fake news.
[01:14.860 --> 01:17.820]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:17.820 --> 01:19.740]  This is a national emergency.
[01:19.740 --> 01:25.580]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:25.580 --> 01:27.580]  This is a female high-level emergency.
[01:29.500 --> 01:31.100]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:31.100 --> 01:34.300]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct
[01:34.300 --> 01:36.860]  communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[01:36.860 --> 01:39.820]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[01:39.820 --> 01:41.580]  They can shut us down, you're next.
[01:42.620 --> 01:46.620]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47.420 --> 01:50.060]  It's Alex John's info war.
[01:50.060 --> 01:58.380]  It's Tuesday, April 30th, 2019.
[01:59.100 --> 02:00.540]  I'm your host Alex Jones,
[02:01.340 --> 02:04.460]  broadcasting worldwide on the AM and FM dial global shortwave.
[02:05.100 --> 02:07.500]  And of course many television stations across the country
[02:08.300 --> 02:11.260]  at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:13.660 --> 02:18.780]  A theme has emerged from the President and from his advisors and from patriots
[02:18.780 --> 02:24.540]  that are in the Pentagon and also from a lot of former actual CIA counterterrorism
[02:24.540 --> 02:28.380]  experts and people that have been in the field and been in command of large operations,
[02:28.380 --> 02:30.380]  not leftist pencil pushing.
[02:31.180 --> 02:34.060]  That's the other CIA we've been battling with the last few years,
[02:34.060 --> 02:35.020]  trying to get the country back.
[02:36.700 --> 02:40.620]  It's emerged that it is confirmed and in Congress is even
[02:41.180 --> 02:44.300]  set to have hearings on this on the attempted coup against Trump
[02:44.300 --> 02:47.100]  that there is still an ongoing embedded group of criminals
[02:47.100 --> 02:52.860]  being directed by Obama, Hillary and others and that they are still trying to overthrow Trump
[02:52.860 --> 02:54.140]  and destroy the First Amendment.
[02:54.140 --> 02:57.020]  They're allied with big tech and the communist Chinese.
[02:57.580 --> 03:02.860]  And so it's now coming out that Biden has gotten billions to his sons.
[03:02.860 --> 03:07.820]  That's B with a B, not millions from communist Chinese state run companies.
[03:08.460 --> 03:12.860]  Joe Biden should have obviously be arrested for treason and tried and dealt with accordingly.
[03:12.860 --> 03:14.220]  But it's all hiding in plain view.
[03:14.220 --> 03:16.780]  That's why they're fighting so hard and won't give up.
[03:16.780 --> 03:19.980]  Because they'd gotten so far down the rat hole.
[03:20.620 --> 03:25.020]  They drug this country so deep down the rat hole that they still believe
[03:25.020 --> 03:27.820]  they can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[03:29.100 --> 03:31.180]  So it's all coming out.
[03:31.180 --> 03:32.940]  The chickens are coming home to roost.
[03:32.940 --> 03:36.060]  We have Rosenstein resigning yesterday.
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.740]  We have the head of the Air Force Academy.
[03:37.740 --> 03:40.860]  Obviously a lot of evidence shows involved staging those racial events
[03:41.500 --> 03:44.460]  for political correctness and mind control being removed.
[03:44.460 --> 03:48.540]  We have the head of Gitmo being removed and I'm told that a lot more is about to happen.
[03:48.540 --> 03:53.420]  The heads are going to start rolling in a big fat juicy way.
[03:53.420 --> 03:57.820]  Larry C. Johnson formally with the CIA and covert operations.
[03:57.820 --> 03:59.820]  He'll be in a bunch of other operations.
[03:59.820 --> 04:02.380]  He'll be joining us to get into this ongoing coup.
[04:02.380 --> 04:04.700]  We're going to play clips from a powerful report
[04:04.700 --> 04:08.380]  that's in a Paul Joseph Watson report up at newswars.com
[04:08.380 --> 04:10.860]  and infowars.com that will play when we come back.
[04:10.860 --> 04:12.300]  I hope you'll share with everyone you know.
[04:12.300 --> 04:16.940]  So, former CIA officer Warren's leftist violence is going to get very, very bad
[04:16.940 --> 04:18.380]  over the next two years.
[04:18.380 --> 04:21.660]  That it's being concerted and driven by deep state in bed groups.
[04:22.380 --> 04:24.860]  And that they're planning to overthrow the president
[04:24.860 --> 04:26.860]  and planning to kill police in mass.
[04:26.860 --> 04:29.500]  And that's a former CIA officer Kevin ship.
[04:29.500 --> 04:31.660]  There's an expert in counterterrorism.
[04:31.660 --> 04:33.820]  Warren's that leftist violence is about to hit.
[04:34.380 --> 04:36.620]  And of course that is very evident.
[04:36.620 --> 04:40.060]  But we're just here reporting the facts why they want us off air.
[04:40.060 --> 04:43.100]  So they believe they have air superiority in the information war
[04:43.100 --> 04:45.900]  when they launched these attempted coups that have already failed.
[04:45.900 --> 04:48.140]  But when they don't first succeed they try and try again.
[04:48.140 --> 04:48.860]  We're winning.
[04:49.500 --> 04:50.140]  We're winning.
[04:50.140 --> 04:52.540]  But the enemy can still take us out.
[04:52.540 --> 04:56.460]  That's why we've got to intensify efforts against the globalist now.
[04:56.460 --> 05:26.300]  Everyone, full effort now.
[05:26.460 --> 05:28.140]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[05:28.140 --> 05:30.940]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[05:32.140 --> 05:36.540]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[05:36.540 --> 05:39.580]  This is a fight about taking your speech away.
[05:39.580 --> 05:40.700]  Not just my speech.
[05:40.700 --> 05:43.020]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[05:43.020 --> 05:44.540]  This country is in a war.
[05:45.340 --> 05:47.580]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done.
[05:47.580 --> 05:50.380]  But I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos
[05:50.380 --> 05:53.740]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us
[05:53.740 --> 05:55.980]  and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[05:55.980 --> 05:56.860]  I'm in your hands.
[05:56.860 --> 05:57.900]  You're in my hands.
[05:57.900 --> 05:59.340]  Infowarsstore.com.
[05:59.340 --> 06:26.220]  Thank you.
[06:29.660 --> 06:37.420]  Hi, Larry C. Johnson worked in the CIA for many years in counterterrorism.
[06:38.060 --> 06:40.700]  And he's going to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[06:40.700 --> 06:41.420]  Hour number two.
[06:41.980 --> 06:45.180]  And he said rightly that we are in the middle of a civil war in this country.
[06:45.180 --> 06:49.180]  And that globalist forces, the chai comms and others are financing the left
[06:49.180 --> 06:53.340]  in an attempt to overthrow an attempt for just the federal government
[06:53.340 --> 06:58.620]  to come back into being and not be a globalist viceroy.
[06:58.620 --> 06:59.900]  Or a globalist governor.
[07:00.620 --> 07:03.660]  Also the exact same things being said, because we're all looking at the same page,
[07:04.300 --> 07:05.980]  the same information, the same truth.
[07:05.980 --> 07:09.340]  Former CIA officer and counterterrorism warrants leftist violence
[07:09.340 --> 07:11.740]  is going to get very, very bad over the next two years.
[07:11.740 --> 07:14.700]  That we're in the middle of a civil war inside the government
[07:14.700 --> 07:17.740]  that leftist forces are trying to create a physical civil war.
[07:17.740 --> 07:21.580]  And that Antifa and others have been lazing police departments.
[07:21.580 --> 07:26.380]  That is preparing, doing dry run attacks to have a massive rollout
[07:26.380 --> 07:31.980]  and mass blood in the streets, decapitating local government ahead of a coup
[07:31.980 --> 07:33.660]  to remove Trump at the federal level.
[07:34.300 --> 07:37.340]  And then they're going to try to activate mainly black communities
[07:37.340 --> 07:40.700]  that the left has been trying to brainwash into burning down cities.
[07:41.340 --> 07:46.300]  And that's actually come out in Alexander Soros documents that we got two years ago.
[07:46.300 --> 07:48.780]  And that ties into another big article here today,
[07:48.780 --> 07:51.820]  admitting that Netflix is trying to create racial division.
[07:51.820 --> 07:54.460]  So is all of the Hollywood Combine.
[07:54.460 --> 07:56.540]  So that is all coming up today.
[07:56.540 --> 08:01.180]  Yes, we've been beating the globalist so far all over the world
[08:01.180 --> 08:03.260]  in nationalism and populism coming back.
[08:03.260 --> 08:07.500]  But that doesn't mean that they don't have a major left hook ready for us
[08:07.500 --> 08:12.860]  and aren't planning all sorts of violence and basically asymmetrical warfare.
[08:12.860 --> 08:17.340]  Now Paul Joseph Watson wrote about this for newswars.com and infowars.com.
[08:17.900 --> 08:23.100]  And also on his site he has now, that is summit.news, very good website.
[08:23.100 --> 08:26.380]  That's former CIA officer warns leftist violence is going to get very, very bad.
[08:26.380 --> 08:31.020]  He'd share this via email, share it via text message, get it past the censors.
[08:31.020 --> 08:32.060]  This is important.
[08:32.060 --> 08:35.820]  Former CIA officer Kevin ship who also worked in the same area counterterrorism
[08:35.820 --> 08:38.940]  warns that this is part of a larger premeditated plan
[08:38.940 --> 08:42.220]  that is going to be intensifying the next 18 months to two years.
[08:42.220 --> 08:44.380]  Let's go ahead and roll a piece of the detailed report.
[08:44.380 --> 08:47.260]  It's an hour long interview at infowars.com.
[08:47.260 --> 08:47.740]  Here it is.
[08:48.380 --> 08:51.500]  But what do you think people should do with what's going on?
[08:51.500 --> 08:55.100]  What's the, what's the danger for we the people in all this?
[08:55.100 --> 08:58.220]  I mean, you say they're going to be a rough and wild summer.
[08:58.220 --> 09:01.500]  You know, you got Donald Trump and making sure all Americans are armed.
[09:02.460 --> 09:04.780]  And what's the danger for we the people?
[09:05.340 --> 09:11.180]  The danger for we the people right now is the dark left and dark left violence.
[09:11.180 --> 09:15.980]  Because as these arrests, these indictments first of all begin to come out.
[09:15.980 --> 09:20.220]  And as the players are called out, the violence on,
[09:20.220 --> 09:25.580]  I call it the dark left is going to increase to the point where it's going to be a very,
[09:25.580 --> 09:26.300]  very bad.
[09:26.300 --> 09:27.340]  There's going to be beatings.
[09:27.340 --> 09:28.620]  There's probably going to be shootings.
[09:28.620 --> 09:30.620]  There's probably going to be shootings at police.
[09:30.620 --> 09:34.940]  And the dark left seeing this, knowing that this didn't work.
[09:34.940 --> 09:38.140]  I think there's going to be a lot of violence if you want to call it left.
[09:38.140 --> 09:42.620]  There's going to be a lot of violence coming from less left in the next year or two Americans.
[09:42.620 --> 09:46.300]  This is one of the reasons that they need to exercise their second amendment right,
[09:46.300 --> 09:53.180]  which I do quite a bit actually, is because of what the left is going to do with these findings
[09:53.180 --> 09:57.980]  and the fact that this could be the death knell for what is now the Democratic Party.
[09:57.980 --> 10:01.820]  And it's certainly the death knell of this coup and the death knell of the dark left's attempt
[10:01.820 --> 10:04.220]  to take over our constitution and culture.
[10:04.220 --> 10:08.620]  They're going to see that and they're going to bring exponentially bring up their violence.
[10:08.620 --> 10:10.300]  And Americans need to arm themselves.
[10:10.300 --> 10:12.060]  They need to protect themselves against that.
[10:12.060 --> 10:15.740]  Speaking of defending yourself against violence,
[10:15.740 --> 10:21.580]  there is a unedited 18 minute video up on info wars.com that we cannot show you here
[10:21.580 --> 10:24.380]  because it would take hours to bleep out all the cuss words.
[10:24.380 --> 10:30.300]  But we do have a short video we're going to play next segment of the young reporter being
[10:30.300 --> 10:35.340]  viciously attacked by Antifa and knocking down six of them before the police come over
[10:35.340 --> 10:43.580]  and arrest Antifa, who literally are a bunch of live action role players out in the real world
[10:43.580 --> 10:47.180]  until they run into patriots and get knocked on their asses.
[10:47.180 --> 10:49.980]  So journalists defend themselves against Antifa mob attack.
[10:50.940 --> 10:54.620]  Believe me, this is a video that you want to watch.
[10:55.420 --> 10:57.420]  If you're a radio listener, it's on info wars.com.
[10:57.420 --> 10:59.980]  We're going to come back and get into that report.
[10:59.980 --> 11:01.020]  But let's pull back here.
[11:01.020 --> 11:04.940]  Yes, they have the methods.
[11:04.940 --> 11:09.420]  Yes, the left has all the entitled professors and all the entitled people that thought they'd
[11:09.420 --> 11:13.020]  be the ruling class that thought that they would rule America that thought that this was
[11:13.020 --> 11:15.820]  their time under Hillary to make their move and take over.
[11:17.020 --> 11:22.460]  But now because it's failed and going down the proverbial historical drainage ditch into the
[11:22.460 --> 11:26.940]  gutter, they are getting even more angry and more pissed.
[11:26.940 --> 11:31.180]  But emblematically, look at Hillary, evil and crone-like.
[11:31.820 --> 11:34.220]  Look at Obama, a Mr. Trendy nobody.
[11:35.100 --> 11:38.780]  Look at Biden, who can hardly talk and slurs his words.
[11:38.780 --> 11:41.340]  He's on so many drugs and so many medications.
[11:42.060 --> 11:44.780]  These are decadent narcissistic drug addicts.
[11:45.340 --> 11:46.460]  They're easy to beat.
[11:46.460 --> 11:48.860]  You just have to call their bluff.
[11:48.860 --> 11:50.380]  So here's old man Joe.
[11:50.380 --> 11:51.660]  Nobody gets to be an old man.
[11:51.660 --> 11:53.500]  He's the one always saying he can kick Trump's ass.
[11:53.500 --> 11:58.060]  He slurs his way through first speech as presidential candidate.
[11:58.060 --> 12:02.140]  So this is the sleepy, creepy, weak Joe Biden.
[12:02.140 --> 12:05.180]  This is the best they can muster against Trump.
[12:05.180 --> 12:29.180]  Here it is.
[12:29.180 --> 12:57.980]  And that's why I get all the big Wall Street money and Trump don't.
[12:57.980 --> 12:59.900]  But that thing is stupid like me.
[13:00.460 --> 13:05.900]  I think maybe Hillary takes on kind of an urban accent when she's in front of blacks.
[13:05.900 --> 13:06.940]  So does AOC.
[13:08.060 --> 13:12.060]  So maybe he just thinks that these union workers are mentally retarded.
[13:12.060 --> 13:12.860]  Maybe that's why.
[13:12.860 --> 13:14.780]  I'm not making fun of other people.
[13:14.780 --> 13:16.380]  I'm really worried about Biden.
[13:16.380 --> 13:17.740]  They just have a big stroke.
[13:18.300 --> 13:20.300]  He's up to tell us about Wall Street.
[13:21.420 --> 13:22.460]  Let's go back to him.
[13:23.180 --> 13:26.060]  All my time in public life, I've gotten involved.
[13:26.060 --> 13:32.700]  The country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, and hedge fund managers.
[13:32.700 --> 13:35.180]  If the enterprise is hard times, everybody took a hit.
[13:35.900 --> 13:42.620]  Union workers, the UAW took incredible cuts in their future and their pensions in the left
[13:42.620 --> 13:44.060]  to get GM working.
[13:44.060 --> 13:49.660]  They also got that last year and try to cut wages or freeze wages for their people.
[13:49.660 --> 13:53.020]  Right today, the same is happening in big hospital systems.
[13:53.020 --> 13:58.860]  They've got to rethink how we define what constitutes a successful economy.
[13:58.860 --> 14:02.460]  Folks in America don't think their children have the same standard of living they had.
[14:02.460 --> 14:04.220]  The same standard with them.
[14:04.220 --> 14:05.580]  Take me to be maintained.
[14:05.580 --> 14:07.340]  I got beer for the tiny.
[14:07.340 --> 14:08.140]  Why do they do that?
[14:08.140 --> 14:13.420]  It means investing much more in medical research to conquer devastating diseases like
[14:13.420 --> 14:13.900]  cancer.
[14:13.900 --> 14:15.820]  They're going to kill the baby after they're born.
[14:15.820 --> 14:19.020]  God bless you all and make God protect our troops.
[14:19.020 --> 14:24.220]  God protect our troops?
[14:24.220 --> 14:26.140]  I mean, that's literally not a manipulated video.
[14:26.140 --> 14:28.460]  If you're a radio listener, it's even worse watching.
[14:28.460 --> 14:31.340]  Because he has to put on that tough guy fake talk act all the time.
[14:31.340 --> 14:33.020]  But this guy's a little bit tiring.
[14:37.260 --> 14:38.700]  Porky Pig meets PCP.
[14:40.300 --> 14:44.940]  Oh, by the way, when we come back, we'll also get into all the big, massive reports coming
[14:44.940 --> 14:46.940]  out in the Wall Street Journal and Fox News.
[14:46.940 --> 14:52.700]  Everything you already heard here years ago, that Joe Biden got $3 billion through his
[14:52.700 --> 14:57.580]  sons for the Chinese government directly from the Chai Cops.
[14:57.580 --> 15:04.460]  I mean, arresting Indyta Jash, hauling him up in front of a jury and then giving
[15:06.620 --> 15:08.780]  the penalty you get for traitors.
[15:08.780 --> 15:13.740]  Seriously, if this country is ever going to heal, we need to have due process and it needs
[15:13.740 --> 15:18.540]  to be carried out and then Joe Biden needs to be led to the gallows poll.
[15:19.420 --> 15:21.660]  After conviction, I wish no violence against him.
[15:21.660 --> 15:22.780]  That would turn him into a martyr.
[15:22.780 --> 15:25.740]  I want him like the Nazis at Nuremberg.
[15:25.740 --> 15:30.380]  I want him given a trial and I want him and Hillary and all the rest of, you know what,
[15:30.380 --> 15:31.340]  let me be magnanimous.
[15:31.340 --> 15:31.980]  I don't want that.
[15:31.980 --> 15:33.180]  That'd make him a martyr too.
[15:33.180 --> 15:35.980]  How about a nice prison sentence for you?
[15:36.940 --> 15:39.260]  How about we send him to a Chinese slave work camp?
[15:40.060 --> 15:41.740]  Always running his mouth against America.
[15:41.740 --> 15:44.060]  Hello, I'm Joe Biden.
[15:44.060 --> 15:48.780]  I've been selling America out for a low time and I'm going to keep doing it.
[15:48.780 --> 15:53.740]  When we come back, watch a crowd of race-like, what appear to be mess mouth,
[15:53.740 --> 16:21.740]  uh, bandage, attack a reporter, get their asses kicked.
[16:24.060 --> 16:28.140]  Come trust your family survival to survivalist camps.com.
[16:29.420 --> 16:31.340]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[16:31.340 --> 16:36.060]  Clawed arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[16:36.060 --> 16:38.300]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[16:38.300 --> 16:40.940]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,
[16:40.940 --> 16:45.500]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that
[16:45.500 --> 16:46.620]  something is wrong.

[16:54.300 --> 16:56.540]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[17:28.460 --> 17:34.860]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[17:34.860 --> 17:37.900]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:37.900 --> 17:43.740]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:43.740 --> 17:47.580]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.580 --> 17:48.860]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.860 --> 17:50.220]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.220 --> 17:53.100]  The Deep State began with World War I.
[17:53.100 --> 17:57.980]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[18:02.620 --> 18:07.980]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[18:07.980 --> 18:12.220]  where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[18:12.220 --> 18:17.260]  Faced of hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions,

[19:59.180 --> 20:28.860]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.180 --> 20:58.860]  I'm an Elemental, my sight is clean, I am perpetual.
[20:58.860 --> 21:10.540]  I'm an Elemental, my sight is clean, I am perpetual.
[21:28.860 --> 21:48.540]  I'm an Elemental, my sight is clean, I am perpetual.
[21:59.820 --> 22:01.340]  FBI report.
[22:01.340 --> 22:08.300]  Antifa activists scheme with drug cartel associates to staged armed rebellion at U.S.
[22:08.300 --> 22:11.020]  border. And what do you think? The trip's being disarmed.
[22:11.020 --> 22:14.780]  And the Mexican government incursions into the U.S. are about.
[22:14.780 --> 22:18.380]  It's all about getting in our face, probing, seeing what we'll put up with.
[22:19.420 --> 22:22.700]  And that ties into all these tweets that Trump has put out about this.
[22:22.700 --> 22:27.740]  The coyotes and drug cartels are in total control of the Mexico side of the southern border.
[22:27.740 --> 22:31.980]  They have labs nearby where they make drugs to sell them into the U.S.
[22:31.980 --> 22:34.380]  Mexico, one of the most dangerous countries in the world.
[22:34.940 --> 22:40.460]  Must eradicate this problem now. Also stop the march to the United States,
[22:40.460 --> 22:43.580]  which just a few months ago the Democrats didn't say even existed.
[22:43.580 --> 22:47.740]  Now they have to admit it and now the Democrats know their own constituents are turning against
[22:47.740 --> 22:52.220]  them over this. So now they're going, okay, there is a border crisis, but Trump created it.
[22:52.220 --> 22:53.580]  Of course you did.
[22:53.580 --> 22:57.340]  If the Democrats don't give us the votes to change our weak,
[22:58.060 --> 23:02.220]  ineffective and dangerous immigration laws, we must fight hard to vote them out,
[23:02.220 --> 23:09.180]  Trump went on to say, in 2020. But all of that now dovetails with this latest footage.
[23:09.180 --> 23:12.620]  In fact, maybe we should put a compilation together of all the times,
[23:12.620 --> 23:17.180]  there's hundreds of these videos, or Antifa walks over and hits a woman in the head of the bike lock
[23:17.180 --> 23:23.980]  and then like 20 dudes just grab her and she just disappears. Like the last episode of Game of
[23:23.980 --> 23:28.060]  Thrones where the zombies climb over the parapet walls and then grab somebody and they just
[23:28.060 --> 23:32.700]  disappear being chewed into pieces. You see that footage at Berkeley of the woman trying to get
[23:32.700 --> 23:37.900]  into here. Milo Yiannopoulos speak and they first hit her and she's bleeding and crying.
[23:37.900 --> 23:42.780]  She holds onto a gate, they grab her and she goes into the dark and they just boil over her and
[23:42.780 --> 23:48.220]  bruises all over, cuts all over, is just men stomper and stomper and glee and other women get
[23:48.220 --> 23:54.700]  in and kick her in the face. The opposite of chivalry, the opposite of honor, treating women
[23:54.700 --> 24:01.260]  like absolute crap, bullies ganging up on people, being anti-free speech. But then there's hundreds
[24:01.260 --> 24:07.900]  of videos of one lone man or maybe two men standing up to 10, 15, 20 of them. Tommy Robinson did it,
[24:07.900 --> 24:11.740]  fought nine of them, knocked five or six down to the ground before they got on top of them and
[24:11.740 --> 24:16.940]  started stomping him. When the police came, Tommy was the bad guy. Even though it was all on footage,
[24:16.940 --> 24:22.860]  he was just trying to leave a McDonald's. Well, now there's new footage and boy, let me tell you,
[24:23.660 --> 24:29.580]  the police reports out, he knocked out four or five more of them after the camera got disconnected.
[24:29.580 --> 24:34.780]  They broke the camera, but he got the tape. The full 18 minutes of video is up on infowars.com.
[24:34.780 --> 24:38.460]  I want to get this journalist on the show. Wish we had the budget, I'd try to hire him.
[24:38.460 --> 24:44.540]  It's up on infowars.com. Journalist defends himself against the Antifa Mob attack. Violent left-wing
[24:44.540 --> 24:49.340]  group stunned by YouTubers' response. Paul Joseph Watson, a journalist, defended himself
[24:49.340 --> 24:55.740]  against a violent Antifa Mob attack during a protest at Huntington Beach on Saturday. The
[24:55.740 --> 25:00.620]  demonstration saw true groups with opposing views on illegal immigration face off against each other.
[25:00.620 --> 25:04.140]  During the rally, a YouTube journalist who goes by the moniker, that's the point,
[25:04.140 --> 25:09.820]  with Brandon, became involved in the confrontation. And you watch the full 18-minute video. This is a
[25:09.820 --> 25:14.540]  short clip. He's just trying to cover the events. He's being nice. They get in his face, start hitting
[25:14.540 --> 25:18.940]  him over and over again, shoving him. The cops come over and say, well, they're not going to let
[25:18.940 --> 25:23.980]  you get on the sidewalk. They own the city now. It's kind of a liberal cop, a leftist cop. But
[25:23.980 --> 25:30.620]  they still attack the journalist. He kicks their ass and the police did arrest five of the ringwraiths.
[25:30.620 --> 25:36.860]  So again, they love to target women. They love to target people in wheelchairs. They are the scum
[25:37.420 --> 25:42.300]  of the earth. And there's more articles out today with professors all over the U.S. calling for
[25:42.300 --> 25:48.620]  physically attacking any Trump supporter that you see in public. So these are terrorist calling
[25:48.620 --> 25:52.860]  for bullying. It's not going to work. We're not cowardly scum like you. It's going to have this
[25:52.860 --> 25:57.260]  response. Radio listeners, I'll try to give you play-by-play, but here it is. Are you guys going
[25:57.260 --> 26:07.660]  skiing? You guys going skiing today? I can ask people questions. Don't put your hand on me.
[26:07.660 --> 26:14.300]  You put your hand on me again. It's going to be a problem. There ain't no problem. Why? They
[26:14.300 --> 26:17.740]  shouldn't be a problem. This is America. I should be able to talk and walk wherever I want, right?
[26:17.740 --> 26:21.660]  Isn't that what you guys stand for? For the freedom and no government and all that bull
[26:21.660 --> 26:28.300]  s***. We're building a wall. We're building a wall. You don't weigh enough, little boy. You're
[26:28.300 --> 26:37.020]  underage, dude. You're underage. Hey, somebody get this child out of my face, please. Hey, don't
[26:37.020 --> 26:52.140]  touch me. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. And then
[26:52.140 --> 26:55.660]  the camera, audio gets knocked off and the camera itself gets knocked off. But the police report
[26:55.660 --> 27:01.500]  says they continue to attack him with clubs and he knocked another three people down who all then
[27:01.500 --> 27:05.980]  tried to file charges, but the cops watched the video and arrested them. One appears to be a man,
[27:05.980 --> 27:10.860]  a woman. Well, there, men and women don't exist. I forgot. Whatever Google says today they are,
[27:11.740 --> 27:18.380]  hits him with a club in the head and he knocks the, what appears to be a ghoul out.
[27:19.660 --> 27:25.340]  So it's, it's pretty amazing footage. It's up on info wars.com and these people are literally
[27:25.340 --> 27:30.940]  LARPers, live action role play. And so they don't meet in the park anymore to be each other over
[27:30.940 --> 27:38.540]  the head with rubber swords or foam swords or foam darts. By the way, I'm not not anybody that
[27:38.540 --> 27:42.460]  does that. I've played that with my kids in the, in the woods behind the house with those nerf arrows.
[27:42.460 --> 27:46.300]  Those are a lot of fun. Not saying that's bad. I'm just saying you don't want to actually come out
[27:46.300 --> 27:50.140]  and do that in the real world and start like a dude walks into a group of about 30 of you and
[27:50.140 --> 27:55.260]  he's not afraid, probably been in some fights, probably not scared of getting punched. And you
[27:55.260 --> 27:59.820]  guys got knocked upside your heads and it's just pathetic to watch these comebacks in motion.
[27:59.820 --> 28:06.220]  And when we come back, Biden to the trader, who by the way, I forgot he did have brain surgery
[28:06.220 --> 28:13.020]  for a stroke. And I think he probably had a mini stroke when he was up there in that speech.
[28:13.020 --> 28:17.580]  We'll play the audio again for you where he sounds like a mixture of porky pig and
[28:18.460 --> 28:23.260]  slowed down two times. It's kind of sad that that's the best they've got, or maybe it's
[28:23.260 --> 28:27.500]  apathetic. We are, we can't beat him. But please, however you're listening, the globalists are
[28:27.500 --> 28:32.860]  trying to move heaven and earth to shut us up ahead of the election. And in six months we'll
[28:32.860 --> 28:36.460]  be in the middle of the election. That's why they're trying to strangle him forwards. Please
[28:36.460 --> 28:40.220]  tell everybody about every local radio station you're listening to, tell them people about it
[28:40.220 --> 28:46.620]  aggressively, lovingly, persistently, and please tell people, hey, Alex Jones, the forbidden guy,
[28:46.620 --> 28:53.180]  he's still on the air, newswars.com. You go there. I know you know that. You're the smart folks.
[28:53.180 --> 28:58.780]  We got to get the general public to do this. They get the big picture.

[30:01.100 --> 30:05.900]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But if you took it
[30:05.900 --> 30:12.140]  with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than that. And that's an example
[30:12.140 --> 30:18.300]  of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best
[30:18.300 --> 30:22.460]  out there. You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil. If you're
[30:22.460 --> 30:25.900]  going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong. They don't give
[30:25.900 --> 30:30.380]  you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry.
[30:30.380 --> 30:34.620]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so
[30:34.620 --> 30:38.460]  good. In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five

[33:25.260 --> 33:33.660]  What do you think people should do with what's going on? What's the danger for we the people
[33:33.660 --> 33:38.860]  in all this? You say there's going to be a rough and wild summer. You had Donald Trump
[33:38.860 --> 33:44.060]  making sure all Americans are armed. What's the danger for we the people?
[33:44.620 --> 33:51.500]  The danger for we the people right now is the dark left and dark left violence. Because as these
[33:51.500 --> 33:58.140]  arrests, these indictments first of all begin to come out and as the players are called out,
[33:58.140 --> 34:03.740]  the violence on I call it the dark left is going to increase to the point where it's going to be
[34:04.540 --> 34:08.060]  very, very bad. There's going to be beatings. There's probably going to be shootings. There's
[34:08.060 --> 34:13.260]  probably going to be shootings at police and the dark left seeing this, knowing that this
[34:13.260 --> 34:17.660]  didn't work. I think there's going to be a lot of violence if you want to call it left. There's
[34:17.660 --> 34:22.220]  going to be a lot of violence coming from the left in the next year or two Americans. This is
[34:22.220 --> 34:27.020]  one of the reasons that they need to exercise their Second Amendment right, which I do quite a bit
[34:27.020 --> 34:33.180]  actually, is because of what the left is going to do with these findings and the fact that this
[34:33.180 --> 34:38.780]  could be the death knell for what is now the Democratic Party and certainly the death knell of
[34:38.780 --> 34:43.500]  this coup and the death knell of the dark left's attempt to take over our Constitution and culture.
[34:43.500 --> 34:47.900]  They're going to see that and they're going to bring exponentially bring up their violence
[34:47.900 --> 34:51.340]  and Americans need to arm themselves. They need to protect themselves against that.
[34:52.220 --> 35:00.220]  Now, what did I say last year when Twitter banned me? I said Antifa has announced plans and it's
[35:00.220 --> 35:05.900]  coordinated out of major foundations and out of major universities with stay-behind groups inside
[35:05.900 --> 35:11.500]  the CIA and FBI, not the entire agencies, but those criminal networks, those embed groups,
[35:11.500 --> 35:17.660]  as Trump calls them, the proper name is stay-behind networks to target and to get intel
[35:18.220 --> 35:22.940]  through their leftist networks on where law enforcement leadership lives, where members of
[35:22.940 --> 35:29.020]  Congress live, where local government people live that are patriots and they have actually dreamed
[35:29.020 --> 35:33.420]  up the schemes that they're going to then come to your house or your work and kill you and your
[35:33.420 --> 35:38.220]  family. Now, of course, this is not going to go too well when they send the methods to do it.
[35:38.220 --> 35:44.540]  They're not meant to do well. They're the decoys like spies like us. There will be some targeted
[35:44.540 --> 35:50.300]  real assassination that takes place carried out by professionals and that's why folks need to be
[35:50.300 --> 35:57.260]  very concerned about this. Now, remember they had Lester Holt and all the rest of the usual suspects
[35:58.140 --> 36:03.740]  read edited statements I said on air. They didn't play audio. They didn't show video because it
[36:03.740 --> 36:08.780]  would have been so edited like word salad made up or like the refrigerator magnets or you could
[36:08.780 --> 36:13.900]  cut stuff out of a magazine and say whatever you want. Magazine may just be an article about
[36:14.620 --> 36:21.500]  gardening, but you could probably cut the words into anything you wanted, a ransom note, anything.
[36:22.700 --> 36:26.620]  And remember, it was a big national story. Jones says attack the media with battle rifles.
[36:27.340 --> 36:31.420]  No, I said Antifa says they're coming to your house just like they did Tucker Carlson. They
[36:31.420 --> 36:37.420]  threatened to kill his wife and you better have your battle rifle next to your bed. I mean, seriously,
[36:38.140 --> 36:46.300]  you better have your firearms ready and secured and you better have a plan of what you're going to do.
[36:47.900 --> 36:51.660]  And if you see the Antifa bust in your door or come in your house,
[36:51.660 --> 36:57.100]  you are under bodily harm threat and you have to defend yourself. So you better think about
[36:57.100 --> 37:01.660]  the type of ammunition you have so that the bullets don't go into your neighbor's house
[37:01.660 --> 37:06.300]  when they go through the Antifa scum. So this is the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:07.660 --> 37:13.740]  This is what's actually unfolding and all the different killing of police,
[37:13.740 --> 37:19.500]  all the different stuff you saw under Obama, that was a prelude to try to get them to capitulate
[37:19.500 --> 37:23.580]  to globalist control for the federal government at that time under Obama's control. And while
[37:23.580 --> 37:30.700]  Retta Lynch had the Strong Cities Initiative to literally put the police of the country under
[37:30.700 --> 37:37.580]  UN control, that's mainstream news. You can't make that up. This is red dawn, level garbage,
[37:38.380 --> 37:43.900]  pipe dreamed out of Bill Ayers and these people who planned this back in the 60s and 70s and now
[37:43.900 --> 37:48.860]  they tried race war under Obama, it failed. And again, it came out in all the documents and all
[37:48.860 --> 37:55.740]  the statements and all the books and all the WikiLeaks that that was their plan. A bold and
[37:55.740 --> 38:01.100]  sane plan and guess what? It's failed and their coup against Trump has failed. But it doesn't
[38:01.100 --> 38:06.060]  mean that just because these rattlesnakes are down, they're out. They are more dangerous
[38:06.940 --> 38:14.140]  and more vicious and more wild eyed than they've ever been. So you just heard the clip there
[38:14.140 --> 38:19.660]  that we were laying out that's up on infowars.com. Former CIA officer, Warren's leftist violence
[38:19.660 --> 38:25.020]  is going to get very, very bad over the next two years. America is in a civil war with the
[38:25.020 --> 38:29.180]  globalist ally of the communist Chinese, the EU and Hollywood against the American people.
[38:29.180 --> 38:34.460]  That's the power players. And of course, that's the reality that we're facing. That was Kevin
[38:34.460 --> 38:39.500]  Schipp. We have joining us another counterterrorism specialist, former with the CIA, Larry C. Johnson
[38:39.500 --> 38:45.260]  next hour, getting into all of this and he concurs and says the same thing because
[38:45.820 --> 38:51.100]  this is what Antifa says they're doing. Now, remember, we push to get Antifa listed as a
[38:51.100 --> 38:56.300]  terrorist organization. They threaten violence, they carry out violence for political aim. They
[38:56.300 --> 39:02.620]  are the definition of it. They're coordinated. They are just the kind of brown shirts or the SA
[39:02.620 --> 39:07.900]  of the wider evil. And Paul Joseph Watson has that article, FBI report, Antifa activists
[39:07.900 --> 39:13.900]  schemed with drug cartel associates to staged arm rebellion at U.S. border. Now think about that.
[39:13.900 --> 39:19.500]  That's a nationwide alert by the FBI saying they've been surveilling Antifa leadership
[39:19.500 --> 39:24.300]  and they are planning to work with MS-13 other cartels to even carry out violence against law
[39:24.300 --> 39:29.980]  enforcement. And what did I say a year ago in that same 35 minute video that scared Lester Holt
[39:29.980 --> 39:36.300]  and scared NBC and ABC and CBS and every channel said, Joan says kill the media. Joan says violence.
[39:36.300 --> 39:42.700]  Jones is dangerous. He's got to be taken off the air, said no such thing. I said MS-13 is the
[39:42.700 --> 39:49.020]  auxiliary hitman for the Democratic Party, Antifa are the useful idiot cover story.
[39:49.580 --> 39:56.620]  And there's going to be other multinational forces, EU, German, sheep dipped intelligence
[39:56.620 --> 40:01.500]  operatives who are going to blow up federal buildings just like last time, just like 95,
[40:01.500 --> 40:05.180]  who are going to carry out targeted assassinations. And people always go what's this
[40:05.180 --> 40:11.180]  anti-German thing, not anti-German. The globalist forces at the end of World War II ended up taking
[40:11.180 --> 40:16.540]  over Germany and setting up Hitler's plan for an EU. They used Germans because they were basically
[40:16.540 --> 40:21.980]  political slaves to build NASA and build the spy grids and do all of it. And so just like we use
[40:21.980 --> 40:27.340]  the British to spy on Trump, that is the globalist too, the U.S. uses foreign governments to spy on
[40:27.340 --> 40:31.820]  their citizens, our government inspires on the German citizens, that's how it works. And I'm
[40:31.820 --> 40:36.700]  just telling you from experience and studying it that we're going to deal in this country,
[40:37.260 --> 40:40.620]  just like we did with the Jackal who was obviously involved in the killer assassination as well,
[40:40.620 --> 40:47.900]  with foreign hitmen in America. MS-13, EU intelligence operatives, Middle Eastern intelligence
[40:47.900 --> 40:55.420]  operatives, mercenaries, you name it, they have assembled an army and they are planning in one
[40:55.420 --> 41:00.540]  night in the future to try to decapitate the government. They will blow up the White House
[41:00.540 --> 41:05.260]  with concerted truck bomb attacks, they will blow up Congress, they will kill Republicans at
[41:05.260 --> 41:09.740]  retreats, they will blow up Republican trains, they will attack Republican baseball games,
[41:09.740 --> 41:15.260]  they will try to kill you and your family, period. And everybody better get the red alert out,
[41:15.260 --> 41:21.420]  well guess what NBC and CNN, I broke it all first and I'm not proud of that, I'm saying it's why
[41:21.420 --> 41:25.420]  we're under attack. We put out the message, everybody knows it now and we're not going
[41:25.420 --> 41:30.540]  to be caught flat footed. So you go ahead and try to pull your crap, you go ahead and try to
[41:30.540 --> 41:35.660]  pull your internet kill switch under the president's nose, you go ahead because America hidden asleep
[41:35.660 --> 41:40.300]  dumbasses, you thought you were going to carry this out with race riots directed by Hillary
[41:40.300 --> 41:46.700]  when she was put in office, guess what, you're not in control. You are the authoritarians,
[41:46.700 --> 41:51.180]  you've been caught, you're allied with the Communist Chinese and now the chickens are coming,
[41:51.180 --> 41:59.740]  home to roost and you're in a lot of trouble. So good luck, go ahead and try it, go ahead and try
[41:59.740 --> 42:03.420]  to pull it, you know they just put up a screen for TV viewer, you saw it radio listeners,
[42:03.420 --> 42:08.220]  Hillary is emperor Palpatine from Star Wars, she looks more evil in the real world without
[42:08.220 --> 42:14.140]  putting her in Palpatine's outfit. I think it makes her look lovable, pull up real photos of
[42:14.140 --> 42:17.980]  Hillary, you want to see the face of evil but it's her actions that are real evil, we're going to
[42:17.980 --> 42:25.020]  come back and get into Biden and the Chinese treason that's now breaking but this is what
[42:25.020 --> 42:29.500]  we're facing, this is the real revolution for America, it doesn't mean Trump's perfect,
[42:29.500 --> 42:33.500]  doesn't mean I'm perfect, doesn't mean you're perfect, it means we're loyal Americans, we believe
[42:33.500 --> 42:37.900]  in America, we believe in freedom, we believe in free market, we believe in the right to self-defense
[42:37.900 --> 42:42.380]  and private property and the right of the unborn and the born and we believe in fighting for it
[42:42.380 --> 42:46.780]  and we're not backing down and you people think harassing me and everything makes me back down,
[42:46.780 --> 42:51.820]  I'll quote John Paul Jones when the British told him to give up when the ship was sinking,
[42:51.820 --> 43:17.820]  he said surrender, I've only begun to fight and he won and we're going to win, you can feel it.

[46:58.860 --> 47:19.100]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:29.740 --> 47:49.100]  so
[47:49.100 --> 47:49.900]  last year
[47:49.900 --> 47:59.740]  about eight months ago about a month after i've been banned off over 70 major platforms apple
[47:59.740 --> 48:06.940]  google youtube facebook that is they they they banned those pages i had
[48:11.820 --> 48:17.660]  we came out and said we've done an analysis of antifa and what they're saying and what they're
[48:17.660 --> 48:22.940]  doing and they've linked up with ms-13. Nancy Pelosi of course was coming out saying that
[48:24.780 --> 48:33.580]  ms-13 was all god's children and i said listen it's standard operating procedure of intelligence
[48:33.580 --> 48:39.020]  agencies when they're overthrowing a government to use criminal networks inside the country that
[48:39.020 --> 48:43.980]  they've made contact with and recruited with the promise of sharing power once they get into control
[48:43.980 --> 48:51.260]  so i'd love to say that i broke all this just because i have a crystal ball in my back room
[48:52.380 --> 48:58.300]  truth is i actually worked my ass off and i do a lot of research and when i went on air and said
[48:58.300 --> 49:02.540]  they're planning a violent overthrow of the president and they're gonna use ms-13 as the
[49:02.540 --> 49:11.580]  mercenaries and antifa as decoys it's because i had 30-something pages of alexander soros's
[49:11.580 --> 49:17.020]  command book from 2015 when they tried to cause martial law and working with blue city police
[49:17.740 --> 49:23.980]  were staging attacks that the police allowed to happen so that blacks would engage in race
[49:23.980 --> 49:30.220]  rioting but the racist leftist soros people were unable to trick blacks into doing it
[49:31.980 --> 49:35.660]  there it is documents until planned for civil unrest and martial law in baltimore that would then
[49:35.660 --> 49:44.620]  spread nationwide but the globalists are still planning this and now the mega super incredible
[49:44.620 --> 49:52.540]  bombshell with almost no fanfare the fbi has come out six months ago and said that antifa groups
[49:53.580 --> 49:59.100]  are listed as terror groups they are they are listed on the terror watch list because that's
[49:59.100 --> 50:04.220]  what they espouse as their doctrine anti-free speech and offensive violence that's the definition
[50:04.220 --> 50:11.580]  of bad guys they wore a mask so there you go well now ladies and gentlemen the fbi's put out a
[50:11.580 --> 50:15.660]  nationwide alert it's gotten almost no attention it's on info wars dot com went up last night we
[50:15.660 --> 50:23.180]  should repost this to the san diego union tribune that antifa is plotting they've been in the meetings
[50:23.180 --> 50:28.700]  physical attacks on military and police to open the border that's the definition of sedition
[50:28.700 --> 50:34.300]  and the definition of insurrection it's not saying i'll fight back to try to forcibly
[50:34.300 --> 50:40.860]  inoculate me or or all you know this or that that's that's we're going to stop the country
[50:40.860 --> 50:52.060]  from existing we're going to open its borders up and a costa and all these people aoc they all
[50:52.060 --> 51:00.300]  run around and and and say we shouldn't have any borders at all this is the plan and it's just
[51:00.300 --> 51:06.140]  sensational that it's actually unfolding but you learn what really upsets them when i laid out that
[51:06.140 --> 51:11.340]  35 minute video emergency message the president that ms-13 was openly working with antifa they
[51:11.340 --> 51:17.100]  were planning to target conservative leadership nationalist leadership loyal leadership patriot
[51:17.100 --> 51:24.140]  leadership american leadership it freaked the hell out of us they keep saying how does he know this
[51:24.140 --> 51:28.780]  it's called research i don't get handed talking points like you left us to everybody asked how
[51:28.780 --> 51:33.980]  did i show up in bullhorn the white house about jack dorsi censorship right when he was having a
[51:33.980 --> 51:41.100]  secret meeting with trump it's called the force being with you nobody told me to be there i said
[51:41.100 --> 51:46.060]  we must go to washington i must bullhorn the white house i've never done it we must bring
[51:46.060 --> 51:52.300]  up censorship and it's just so that's the way god works folks and the left doesn't understand god
[51:52.300 --> 51:59.740]  because they want to be god ladies and gentlemen instead of wanting to know god you want to know
[51:59.740 --> 52:06.540]  god not be god the more you know god the more pathetic you know you are but again all these
[52:06.540 --> 52:10.940]  little narcissistic know-it-alls the only reason i point out how right we are is because that's why
[52:10.940 --> 52:16.940]  they fear us they think i'm inside their head because i am and many of you are inside their
[52:16.940 --> 52:22.220]  head as well because you know they're criminals you know they're past behavior and past behavior is
[52:22.220 --> 52:27.580]  the most indicative of future behavior isn't it everybody knows that leopards don't change their
[52:27.580 --> 52:33.980]  spots you know the old parable the old african parable of the scorpion and the frog and the
[52:33.980 --> 52:40.140]  frogs nice and friendly and the scorpion says we carry me across the river and the frog says no
[52:40.140 --> 52:44.300]  you're mean you'll sting me you'll kill me he goes no i promise i promise just be my friend
[52:44.300 --> 52:48.380]  he says okay and he gives him a ride across and they get to the other side and the scorpion
[52:48.380 --> 52:55.980]  goes boom and the frog goes that hurt really bad i'm dying what you i'm nice to you i said
[52:55.980 --> 53:10.460]  cute dumbass frog i'm a scorpion i mean these people are the worst of the worst picked by the
[53:10.460 --> 53:16.540]  globalist to sell the nation out and then they've got the nerve to point at those of us who they
[53:16.540 --> 53:21.900]  call romantic they call boobs they call stupid because we believe in something yeah it's called
[53:21.900 --> 53:26.780]  our children what you don't think we couldn't be evil like you we're smart enough to know where
[53:26.780 --> 53:32.620]  that leads dumbass we like having a floor to things we like having a bottom we like having
[53:32.620 --> 53:37.820]  chivalry we like leave the women and children out of war you know this stuff got developed out of
[53:37.820 --> 53:42.300]  thousands of years of barbarism and death and hitting bottom and once you hit bottom you want
[53:42.300 --> 53:46.780]  to go towards the light not towards the dark you haven't hit the bottom yet democrats you will
[53:46.780 --> 53:53.020]  because once you make your next move we're going to help you like christ said we're going to tie
[53:53.020 --> 53:58.140]  a big millstone around your neck and throw your ass in the deepest abyss because that's where you
[53:58.140 --> 54:02.940]  go that's where trash goes i don't take any pleasure it's like stepping in dog crap i'm
[54:02.940 --> 54:07.260]  going to clean it off your shoes now i already mentioned it but i'm going to get deep into the
[54:07.260 --> 54:11.180]  report of biden caught working with the tricoms this is this is real this is bonafide this is
[54:11.180 --> 54:15.980]  billions to his sons this is state-run stuff this is him making decisions his vice president
[54:15.980 --> 54:21.740]  to screw over u.s companies this is quid pro quo this is open and shut hand the cookie jar this is
[54:21.740 --> 54:30.140]  it this makes you know the lakosa nostril look like little angel cakes that's all coming up but
[54:30.140 --> 54:35.020]  let me tell you about something really important here we have the biggest special ever it is the
[54:35.020 --> 54:40.300]  biggest special ever on survival shield x2 that we didn't think we could get any more but we we
[54:40.300 --> 54:45.420]  cancelled the contract as they kept jacking up prices on the 12,000 7 to 12,000 foot deep pure
[54:45.420 --> 54:50.220]  iodine that nobody else has that has all these incredible effects just experience it yourself
[54:50.220 --> 54:53.660]  there's nothing else like it other than maybe fish oil it all synergistically goes together
[54:54.460 --> 54:59.340]  but any red blooded human really needs this we were able to get it again and by the way it's our
[54:59.340 --> 55:06.220]  overall most profitable item you know we sell more knockout sleep anything else but that's
[55:06.220 --> 55:11.260]  so low priced that it doesn't really fund our operation but but x2 does it's got a decent
[55:11.260 --> 55:17.980]  markup on it but it's 25% off right now and a free bottle of x3 that has the deep earth
[55:17.980 --> 55:23.260]  crystal source in it as well that we got from another source before i got the other guys to
[55:23.260 --> 55:26.540]  back down put me over a barrel and i talked to scientists and they said why don't you add the
[55:26.540 --> 55:31.820]  other two types of iodine so that's all three for tri iodine because some people can't absorb
[55:31.820 --> 55:36.380]  pure iodine most people can't absorb iodine that isn't pure that's the big secret most of it's
[55:36.380 --> 55:41.500]  bound in the ground or bound to other things in the environment so you don't absorb it so
[55:41.500 --> 55:46.060]  a survival shield x3 is weaker there was a big debate in the scientific community that we
[55:46.060 --> 55:51.260]  talked to uh literal scientists that even though you know they could say that's seen as grass
[55:51.260 --> 55:55.820]  certified or you know FDA says it's okay to have x2 as strong as it is that maybe we should put
[55:55.820 --> 56:01.180]  out a weaker brand and people looked at simple wise x3 weaker well for kids or you know i mean you
[56:01.180 --> 56:06.940]  you want to be really careful with iodine because this is such a missing link ladies and gentlemen
[56:06.940 --> 56:14.140]  this is so important it's it's it's the good halogen that with low iodine iqs or 15 points
[56:14.140 --> 56:19.740]  lower on average just type in iodine and iq studies you'll get Harvard studies you'll get
[56:19.740 --> 56:24.300]  university of texas studies you'll get studies back from the 30s and 40s and 50s for a while
[56:24.300 --> 56:33.020]  the government put it in the salt because people's iqs were just going straight down the tubes
[56:33.980 --> 56:38.460]  and there was goiter and all these problems they put a little bit of a cruddy low-quality iodine in
[56:38.460 --> 56:44.540]  and boom iqs dropped 15 points the big swollen thyroid problems you know went by by and no one
[56:44.540 --> 56:49.660]  will tell you then why there's all these issues now because we're we're iodine starved ladies and
[56:49.660 --> 56:56.540]  gentlemen we're iodine starved right now and i'm telling you i'm the same way i'm not a big
[56:56.540 --> 57:01.100]  supplement guy i know how good they are but i'll forget to take this for a month and i'm like wait
[57:01.100 --> 57:05.900]  i feel bad i feel sluggish i'm getting away i religiously went back on iodine three weeks ago

[57:12.540 --> 57:18.380]  because i've been doing a lot of uh on the road stuff i've lost five pounds working out less

[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:56.140]  and look i know our listeners are awesome it brings tears to my eyes when i walked through an airport
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:08.220]  and black white hispanic asian old young male female our listeners are strong focused firing
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:14.140]  their eyes and then i see the left when they attack me in the street they all look mentally ill
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:20.380]  you think i feel good well look at all these mentally ill people it's scary it's like a zombie
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:27.900]  disease and i think about the incredible work of all of our reporters and all of our writers and i
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:35.100]  just want to get their information out viewer discretion is advised a new article just went
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:40.700]  up on info wars dot com by paul watson minutes ago it's a venezuela the government running over
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:46.060]  citizens with armored vehicles so viewer discretion is advised next segment we're gonna get to this
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:53.260]  shock video shows government vehicle mowing down venezuelan protesters and that's why
[01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:59.100]  people are starting to shoot back and people say oh we shouldn't have an intervention
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:04.540]  i was against all these other wars this is on our doorstep in northern south america
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:12.140]  they're staging with the un the border collapsing and we're under attack and i don't like invading
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:18.940]  countries but this is teddy roosevelt would have invaded eisenhower would have invaded
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:27.740]  you know in the old days we put governments in the middle east to stabilize things and let
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:32.460]  women go to college that's what eisenhower did now we put governments in that throw gays off buildings
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:35.820]  but then tell us we're gonna teach five-year-olds how to be gay here in the us it's all just a
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:41.500]  discordant evil so i'm not saying go to venezuela because i don't trust the neocons to not double
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:47.180]  cross trump and mess it up or put some dictatorship in there we don't need a right-wing dictatorship
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:52.780]  either we just don't need maduro down there thousands starved to death a week for years
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:57.020]  they ate all their dogs and cats four or five years ago they lost 30 something pounds on average
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:03.980]  last year that was in the news even orders reported and now you've got armored vehicles from the state
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:08.780]  running people over and and the left will spend it oh that's a fake false flag no it's not i watched
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:14.460]  all the footage of them burning those trucks they were stay stop those trucks they didn't let aid
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.980]  come in from columbia and they burned those damn trucks i know false flags when i see them those
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:27.580]  aren't false flags give me a break oh the soldiers accidentally set the aid convoys on fire uh-huh
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:37.180]  all right it is total bedlam down there and the butter knife brigade is going to remove
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:42.860]  maduro it's it's over i predicted two months he's gone and we could probably just sit back
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:47.260]  and just wait for him to collapse the problem is this is a humanitarian crisis show i don't want
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:52.220]  to hear about we've got to invade this or that over a manager in crisis this is a absolute out of
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:59.980]  control situation shots fired all over the country even the poor barrio districts that have been the
[01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:05.980]  biggest supporters of the communist government are now the ones being uh a terrorized firebomb
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:09.740]  by the government when they protest the only people to get food or the military and police
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:13.500]  well that's not going to last very long because they're running out all the gold
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:18.380]  and all the and all the treasuries they have to ship food in and pretty soon people are just
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:24.060]  going to start shooting at any aircraft that land and so there'll be no more aircraft coming in
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:30.300]  so that place is circling it already circled the toilet bowl it already went down the toilet bowl
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:36.300]  and it's it's just a shame because the country's got so much resources i just can oil that shock
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.300]  footage when we come back and so much more and then boy if you were triggered by greg reese's

[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:08.180]  Also the new video, journalist defends himself against Antifa mob attack, violent left wing
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:15.180]  groups stunned by YouTube's response.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:24.780]  Now, I want to get to the latest in Venezuela with armored vehicles running over crowds of
[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:28.500]  people and our own liberal media praising it and saying it's a great thing.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.780]  I want to praise the Arab Spring.
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:36.460]  Shock video shows government vehicle mowing down Venezuelan protesters, socialist hellhole
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:42.780]  teeters on the brink of collapse and like a black hole swallows in countless other innocent
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.780]  people.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.540]  But this is what Wall Street and the big megabanks are funding.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:51.140]  Trump didn't get 1% of the Wall Street money.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.380]  Hillary got almost all of it.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.380]  Am I against free market?
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.380]  Am I against Wall Street?
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.380]  No.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.460]  But the big megabanks that run Wall Street have moved to China.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:04.580]  They're allied with authoritarianism and they want to have socialism for the general
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:09.340]  public and communism because it ends competition for us.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.980]  The big megacorporations are offshore.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.180]  They're tax exempt.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:16.780]  They don't play by the rules they impose on us.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.660]  So here's the report.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:22.900]  A shocking video out of Venezuela shows an armored government vehicle mowing down a group
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.340]  of protesters.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:29.580]  The footage shows demonstrators in Caracas throwing objects at the tank-styled trucks.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.260]  I look like they were made in the U.S.
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:38.100]  Some of the vehicles then mounts a curb and plows into protesters as they attempt to flee.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:41.700]  Two victims who appear to be seriously injured are then dragged away by the crowd.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:48.820]  Venezuelan opposition leader on Tuesday called for military uprising to oust President Maduro
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.860]  reports the Associated Press.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:55.500]  Armed factions have been engaging in gun battles all day outside of Caracas air base.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:03.100]  That's the key, as the country teeters on the brink of collapse, yay socialism.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.460]  That's up on infowars.com.
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:06.620]  What is going to happen?
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:11.980]  Well, I'll just say this, Mexico is already getting its aid cut and they better stop the
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:16.180]  millions pouring up here or we're going to have to go into Mexico because they border
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:20.420]  us and they're allowing this and it's an active war to flood somebody with millions of people,
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.420]  especially criminals.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.340]  Many of them are criminals that were being flooded with.
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:29.460]  So this is a very serious situation and national polls are out showing that Democrats are really
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:31.380]  upset about this and think it's a big crisis.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:38.300]  So now the Democratic Party is admitting the crisis is real, but trying to spin it all
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:43.860]  and tell everybody that it's Trump's fault as if you have no memory.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.580]  Now I want to go to this report.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:52.340]  Greg Rees did a report last week, early last week that caused a lot of controversy and
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:56.940]  we're going to repost this new report and the old report from last week up on infowars.com.
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:58.620]  In fact, I think it's probably already up.
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:03.700]  I talked to him during the break about five minutes ago so people can see the original
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.060]  report that Greg Rees put out as well.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.860]  But this is a new report that we're going to premiere here and this is the origins of
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:16.500]  Islamophobia and I want to be clear, there are a lot of Muslims that are nice people
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.980]  and I don't think they all want to kill everybody and take over, but Islam started 1400 years
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:27.660]  ago in Saudi Arabia today at Mecca and Medina and it's now taken over half the planet and
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:32.420]  there's about to be 3 billion Muslims and leftist media is always defending Islam and
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:37.820]  covering up for it and if you criticize murder, death, sexual mutilation in Europe, you get
[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:42.900]  arrested so it's protected and so that makes me go after it more.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:49.340]  So Islam needs a reformation and by the way, we don't respond to people criticizing us
[01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:52.180]  when we criticize Islam by kissing Islam's ass.
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:56.220]  We are just trying to be really fair and balanced here to look at what's happening, but I'm
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:01.140]  not going to sit here and when Christians get blown up and call it Easter worshipers,
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.820]  we're going to call it Christianity under attack, it is and for every Muslim that gets
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:11.580]  killed by a Christian, there's probably 500 Christians that get killed and so we're going
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.300]  to do what the establishment says we're not supposed to.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:17.820]  They say we're not supposed to say that men can't compete in women's sports and then
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.820]  win every contest.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.140]  Transgender athlete smashes four women's powerlifting records.
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:25.140]  This is a joke.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.860]  You tell us not to, we're going to cover it.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:33.980]  So here's Greg Rees' report that did you just go live on infowars.com, please share it,
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:40.540]  the true origins of Islamophobia.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:47.780]  Early Christianity was centered on the relationship between God and the individual and after centuries
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:54.340]  of persecuting Christians, Rome created the Catholic Church, declared it the state religion
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.180]  and changed the Christian doctrine.
[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:02.420]  Practicing Christianity was now legal so long as it was Catholic.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.900]  There is clear evidence that every people have had their religions subverted from the
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:11.700]  truth, but none more egregiously than the Muslim.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:16.900]  Before there was any such thing as Islam, there were Sufi Muslims and they lived in
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:20.900]  relative harmony amongst Christians and Jews.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:25.740]  The Sufi way was similar to that of early Christianity.
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:32.220]  It taught that a personal relationship with God was not only achievable by the individual,
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:33.740]  but it was essential.
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:40.300]  The Sufi poets were philosophers sharing knowledge and ideas with the community and they always
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:46.420]  described the Prophet Muhammad as a wise man of admirable temperament.
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:51.140]  Similar to how the Christians described Christ.
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:56.860]  Hundreds of years later, a much different version of Muhammad was put forth by a priest
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:02.500]  class engaged in the bloodiest conquest of their time.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:08.180]  They published and distributed the Quran and the Hadith and claimed they were the absolute
[01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:10.180]  word of God.
[01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:17.620]  A written ideology forced upon all Muslims that allows an unelected priest class to dictate
[01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:22.660]  the word of God and outlaw all opposing views.
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:29.300]  The Quran was accused of plagiarizing Sufi poems and Sufi Muslims were naturally reluctant
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:34.060]  to accept the clerics as middlemen between themselves and God.
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:39.420]  But Islam had zero tolerance for any opposition.
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:46.660]  Sufis were burned, Sufis were killed and Muslims were subjugated under the new law.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:49.460]  Islam was brutal from the start.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.780]  The Quran itself describes how people would pretend to be with Islam because they feared
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.140]  being killed.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:03.940]  According to Islam, Muhammad himself had dozens killed for criticizing him.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:11.580]  Many used the words extreme Islam or radical Islam to describe Islamic terrorism.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:16.460]  But a better choice of words would be fundamentalist Islam.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:22.180]  Because if you accept the Quran to be the literal word of God as Islam commands, then
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:29.180]  waging terror and jihad upon non-Muslims is absolutely the highest path.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:35.140]  Even the most respected Muslim scholars agree that the final chapter of the Quran abrogates
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:41.940]  all else and the final chapter tells Muslims to fight Jews and Christians until they submit
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.460]  as willing slaves.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:49.780]  According to the Hadith, Muhammad loved jihad so much that he prayed to be reincarnated
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:54.180]  so that he could fight and die over and over again.
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:59.860]  According to the Quran and Hadith, suicidal terrorists who kill non-Muslims are the heroes
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.580]  of Islam.
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:07.420]  The Quran teaches that Muslims are superior to all others and that Jews and Christians
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.860]  are the worst of creatures.
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:13.260]  It teaches that women are mentally deficient.
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:19.220]  It teaches Muslims to punish non-Muslims, make enemies with them and wage war against
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.220]  them.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:27.580]  The Quran tells us that Allah granted Muslims the right to rape women and own sex slaves,
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.420]  including children who have not yet reached puberty.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.620]  Alright folks, we're going to go to break.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.740]  That's only half the report.
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.500]  It's up on infowars.com.

[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.380]  It's also on newswars.com.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.940]  The true origins of Islamophobia is up on the side.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:46.700]  But we're going to shift gears and get into what I said I'd covered.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.380]  And that's a Biden openly run by China.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.580]  Will he be arrested?
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.100]  I think so.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:54.140]  We either arrest all these people or they win.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.820]  These are foreign traders.

[01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:09.780]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.780]  take vitamins at all.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.860]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:16.900]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.900]  I trust.
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.900]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.980]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them and they're often not things
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:23.980]  that are natural.
[01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:24.980]  I appreciate that.
[01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:25.980]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force?
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:26.980]  Tell us about it.
[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:27.980]  Well, it's really great.
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:28.980]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:29.980]  I take it.
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:30.980]  It tastes good.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:31.980]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:35.500]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and, you know, it just gives me energy and
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.500]  fuels me throughout the day.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.500]  So I really like it.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:40.300]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:44.100]  They're known to turbo charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:47.500]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.340]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:51.500]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:57.940]  Infowarsstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:02.020]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.260]  be there for my children someday.
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.180]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.900]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.740]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:10.380]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:13.180]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:16.180]  You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're even better
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.340]  getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:23.020]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.020]  burning, isn't it?
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:27.420]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:31.740]  I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:36.540]  know the truth and you can't be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something
[01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:39.460]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:43.260]  There is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time.
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:47.780]  When you commit the word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos,
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.820]  that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:55.420]  So please now commit to support Info Wars however you can and realize your provision
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:01.940]  to Info Wars is your own provision.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:28.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m.
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:33.940]  I'm here live and you got to ensure in the war room 3 p.m. central we're about to add
[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:37.420]  some more shows as well will be announced the next few weeks.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:43.380]  We also have David I do a great job weekday mornings 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. when I come on
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:48.300]  joining us in the next segment is Larry C. Johnson of CIA counterterrorism formerly
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:54.060]  who's come out and exposed the coup plot against Trump years ago it's now all been confirmed
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.820]  and then we'll get his take on what other folks are saying counterterrorism specialist
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:03.660]  about the left's open calls for civil war the FBI terror alert to the antifa is basically
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:08.980]  the deep states decoy for violence to trigger violence we'll talk about that all with him
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.860]  but here's really the big news I know as an audience and as researchers you already know
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:18.420]  all about Joe Biden but the general public doesn't and you know it's a great bait and
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:23.940]  switch it's a great diversionary tactic you see in old movies or cartoons where the villain
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.260]  gets caught and then whoever the hero is that just caught the villain goes no actually he's
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:38.220]  the spy he's the one well the real world that actually goes on and so now there's a big Breitbart
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:43.380]  article up on him force dot com and Breitbart dot com that has a long 20 minute interview
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:48.620]  that was done on Fox News that goes through all the evidence and these investigative journalists
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:52.500]  that have looked into this but Biden didn't hide this because he thought that the you
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:59.100]  know the Clintons and people being power forever Biden under Obama particularly his sons got
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:04.260]  billions and billions of natural gas and oil they made hundreds of millions themselves
[01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:09.860]  they got over three billion from Chinese companies to their companies again the Bidens have made
[01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:13.260]  hundreds and hundreds of millions that we know of and they've got a bunch of offshore
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:21.180]  accounts so if you think Manafort was doing some stuff that he was nothing so Steve Hilton
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:29.220]  China is funding Biden family businesses with billions Hunter Biden Biden the second son
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:34.340]  secured a one billion in financing from the Bank of China an arm of the Chinese government
[01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:39.940]  for a private equity firm founded by himself and Christopher Heinz the stepson of former
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:43.900]  secretary of state John Kerry and again I've read all the stuff on this even before it
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:50.140]  came out in Breitbart it's three billion from China two billion at least from Ukraine Joe
[01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:55.520]  Biden is the very definition of a corporate insider said Hilton rejecting left-wing and
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:00.420]  partisan Democrat marketing in fact can we queue up his slurred speech the other night
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:08.460]  Biden as a man of the working people he profiled Biden a segment entitled swamp watch Hilton
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:14.340]  added with Joe Biden there's a much more worrying relationship with the foreign power one that
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:22.620]  represents a vastly bigger threat to America than Russia and China so going over all this
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:29.260]  it's a big report and it links to other detailed reports that break all this down this is only
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:35.540]  one area of the China sellout directly with the state owned Bank of China and the other
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:40.660]  companies are direct state owned facilities and state owned energy companies technology
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:48.460]  companies you name it and it's clear payoff absolutely clear payoff the Chinese have
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:52.900]  no rules but screw over America the Chinese Communist they do whatever they want whenever
[01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:57.260]  they want they make US companies that move there give them all their technology I was
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:03.740]  there bowling last week for his blaze TV it's the Claire TV show in DC and I told him I
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:08.660]  said no Apple officially moved their last April last April they officially moved there
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:13.300]  a year ago Reuters reported they had to give all the code keys to everybody's devices to
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:19.060]  the Chinese government and Eric stopped the cameras had him looking up on a phone read
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:26.180]  the article needs to be a big stockbroker he couldn't believe it ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:34.540]  the level of the treason is absolutely mind blowing and it's done right out in the open
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:37.540]  so what do you do if you're Biden and the Clintons and you've sold out because they're
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.780]  not Chinese agents they just sell it to everybody they're just the worst traders you could ever
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:49.740]  imagine as long as it's anti-American what do you do you then blame Trump and the nationalists
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:58.260]  and the patriots with what you yourself have done it's truly dangerous it's it's insane
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:02.180]  and it's coming to a head right now ladies and gentlemen and we're going to look though
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:07.500]  at how the deep state plans to fight back and all these resignations of Rosenstein and
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:12.660]  of the head of the Air Force Academy and of the head of Gitmo I'm told by some folks in
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:19.180]  Florida in the military that are pretty smart that this is a big big deal we'll get this
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:26.180]  former covert operations anti-terrorism expert from the CIA on next segment Larry C. Johnson
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:31.460]  to give us a take on that before I go to break because I never do this properly and I need
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:36.980]  to do this properly and people need to listen up to me okay I think everybody's noticed
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:41.580]  that we really try to give you accurate info and have some of the most accurate information
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:48.100]  out there I told you last year eight months ago I got man from Twitter for it that Antifa
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:53.180]  is working with MS-13 the Democrats as their muscle on the ground to carry out assassinations
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:58.180]  you name it it's an FBI alert they've been inside the meetings specific groups they're
[01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:01.740]  getting ready to arrest this is serious folks you see them over the news saying kill the
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:08.300]  president this is how the chai comms and others are manipulating through the sellouts in our
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:13.980]  government that wanted to sell the country out that's what globalism is so it's very
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:19.220]  very very important that folks understand this is very serious and that without you
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.060]  spreading the word and without you buying the products we won't be here I don't get
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.500]  money from the chai comms or George Soros I fund this operation and all these shows and
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.380]  all these investigative reporters that are in the field confronting Biden yesterday and
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.780]  you know Caitlyn Bennett getting 30 million views a month and and maybe we were getting
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.700]  20 million a month I mean we we're toe to toe with these people okay and I'm not bragging

[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:36.460]  Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones well we're getting them on the
[01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:40.820]  line right now the Skype Larry C. Johnson distinguished member of the CIA and counter
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:45.100]  terrorism he's been pointing out that there's been a real attempt to kill this country for
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:49.460]  several years it's all been confirmed with the latest from him in a moment but here he
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:56.500]  was last week when I was on one American news as a guest I noticed that he was live during
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:00.260]  one of their programs and thought what he said was very informative so here it is one
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:07.340]  of the strengths of strengths and weaknesses or dangers of this five eyes cooperative is
[01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:14.620]  that it provides a channel for sharing intelligence information Johnson said there is a cooperation
[01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:21.140]  agreement between the intelligence services of the U.S. U.K. Canada New Zealand and Australia
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.500]  the so-called five eyes club that allowed the Obama administration to access surveillance
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:32.500]  of U.S. citizens as foreign gathered intelligence on this side of the ocean who are the highest
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:38.580]  levels of U.S. intelligence community is sort of an agreement to collect and share information
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:44.220]  and do it in a way that would not necessarily attract and do attention but would provide
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:49.580]  a documentary record that could be being used to justify targeting Donald Trump just as
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:54.660]  the Trump administration took office a senior official in the Obama Pentagon had an unguarded
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:35:00.660]  moment on MSNBC I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:06.780]  people who left so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks if
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:13.580]  they found out how we knew what we knew about their the staff the Trump staffs dealing with
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:18.420]  Russians that they would try to compromise those sources and methods we know that specifically
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:23.740]  from a former Department of Defense official under Obama named Evelyn Farkas she admitted
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:28.540]  to it Johnson said in the beginning the British were simply curious about Donald Trump as
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:33.540]  he became a serious candidate for president the British did this in part I'm given to
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:38.860]  understand by people who were familiar with what was up is that they were concerned about
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:43.940]  Trump's policies on NATO and Syria and they they wanted to make sure that they could start
[01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:48.900]  understanding what he was up to one clear example of the UK surveillance was the monitoring
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:54.500]  of Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos he said how did George Papadopoulos come to
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:36:00.700]  the attention of both law enforcement and intelligence forces and when you look at his story you
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:08.180]  begin to realize his first communications from UK to the United States they were emails so
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:14.060]  maybe and one or two phone calls I would probably call correctly well those were intercepted I
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:19.660]  absolutely they were intercepted by the United Kingdom he was general communications headquarters
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:24.380]  all right so that's Larry C. Johnson and I've seen him on national television he's been on
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:28.980]  the show before I mean he was laying all this out two plus years ago just like we were what's
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:34.460]  crazy is how public all this is how brazen all this is and and so I wanted to get into the
[01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:39.660]  five eyes the spine how illegal this was Trump says he's taken the gloves off we've seen these
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:45.420]  firings we've seen these high-level resignations and I've talked to three people last week to
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:50.100]  which met public met with the president he said no I'm we're gonna arrest them all we're getting
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:54.340]  them all and I think that's why they're panicking is because I think this president's for real
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:58.100]  and understands that he's actually trying to be the president maybe I'm wrong but Larry C.
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:04.820]  Johnson without going through your whole bio distinguish CIA counterterrorism expert run
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:10.780]  major operations your respected guy in a patriot what would you call this period we're in I would
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:16.020]  call it a governmental civil war I would call it a world crisis I what would you call this
[01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:20.860]  period we're in and now that the deep state or criminal elements of it have failed where
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:27.100]  we're going here well the intelligence community and the law enforcement community have been
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:35.140]  weaponized against a domestic opposition party it's that simple we've really never experienced
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:42.340]  in our history where these tools of government were turned on the opposing political party
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:51.660]  and in such an intense way and it was designed you know people will disparage Trump for calling
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:57.380]  it a coup but I don't know what else you can call it this is exactly a failed coup attempt
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:03.420]  and people like Jim Clapper and John Brennan and Jim Comey and Moretta Lynch and Susan
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:09.180]  Rice they were all involved all implicated and they're trying to pretend now that they
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:15.220]  were just you know looking for the bad deeds of Russians who just happened to stumble across
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:24.940]  all these Trump people which is just a lie you are the expert here and the real expert
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.060]  is years ago I saw you on actual TV we had you on a few years ago you were laying this
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:34.200]  out then now it's all been confirmed looking at the psychology of the different elements
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.740]  of the deep state obviously just criminal cliques or in bed groups Obama clearly left
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:45.020]  stay behind networks in my research behind they're still operating and I think they thought
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:48.740]  from decades of getting away where they wanted to that they were invincible I don't think
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:53.820]  they understand they've overreached so far now that even the establishment realizes they've
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.380]  got to be punished and gotten rid of because they're not giving up they are engaged in
[01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:01.500]  anti free speech terrorizing the public if I got into stuff they've done to me I'm not
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:06.500]  trying to in a victimology it's actually entertaining but it's like a spy movie and so I'm wondering
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:12.180]  what do you think a quantify this for folks and then what do you think is coming next
[01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.580]  what are they going to do in their death rows because I think Trump's going to move against
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:24.180]  them I think bar is forced to move against them maybe I'm wrong well I hope bar moves
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:29.980]  against them I think he will a lot of this I do lay at the feet of Donald Trump himself
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:34.260]  because when he came into office he left all these people in place he had the full authority
[01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:40.300]  and power to remove a lot of what are known as senior executive service senior intelligence
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:45.980]  service they really serve at the direction and discretion of the president his failure
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:52.260]  to get rid of them is it's on him I can't blame the deep state for that no I agree the
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:56.540]  other the other point though I think you correctly know is this didn't just start with Donald
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:02.580]  Trump it started you yourself have experienced this persecution we saw that James Rosen
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:08.860]  of Fox News was being spied upon other journalists were being spied upon so this is something
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:14.140]  that the Obama administration started doing early on and then it just they got so used
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:19.900]  to doing it and getting away with it it just escalated and expanded dramatically and then
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:24.100]  when you know what through phases with Trump because in the initial phase of the Trump
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:29.580]  campaign nobody thought he was going to win but they were collecting information that
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:38.300]  you would do for let's call it opposition research on steroids because they were enlisting
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:44.100]  British firms are enlisting British intelligence to help start identifying people that the Trump
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:49.700]  campaign folks are talking to and then when it looked like Trump was going to get the
[01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:56.300]  nomination it entered another phase even more intense and this starts about March of 2016
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:04.980]  and you can see that's when Perkins Coy hires fusion GPS and Christopher Steele is brought
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:10.380]  on with the do the dossier that's the time period they start going intensively after
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:14.980]  a Papadopoulos that's the time frame when they start going after Carter Page.
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:21.180]  So this this had sort of a natural progression and then phase three comes when Trump stuns
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:26.900]  them because I know for a fact from a friend who was present in some conversations between
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:32.380]  Clapper and Brennan that they genuinely did not believe that Trump would win and they
[01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:37.540]  were even counseled by the FBI is it don't be so certain of that I know people that were
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:42.980]  in the room of security with Hillary that literally she was totally drunk got even drunker
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:47.780]  through a fit attack people and collapsed that night.
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:53.220]  Yeah so this was it was stunning for all of these folks and it was at that point that
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:59.860]  they've entered the phase three of trying to find an extra judicial way to get rid of
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:05.860]  Donald Trump even entertaining thoughts of making approaches to federal judges to have
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:12.100]  his election ruled as illegal and then opting for that was Nancy Pelosi's daughter and
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:16.220]  then when I talked about that she went on Fox and said I death threaded her stay right
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.540]  there I want to come back sir and get into all this and what you think they're going
[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:23.420]  to do now are they going to give up or they're going to keep striking back because obviously
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:27.620]  I've been asked by the FBI and others not to get into all the things that happen behind
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:32.900]  the scenes but I reported this the FBI and I mean repeatedly the stuff I caught them
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:37.940]  and it's what you're saying they're they're wild eyed they don't they're not accustomed
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:42.140]  to having anybody stand up against them so they've committed so many wild crimes how
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:46.260]  does Trump not prosecute him but as you said why does Trump leave them in the government
[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:49.740]  we'll be right back with our guest Larry C. Johnson will tell you about a website we
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:59.100]  can read more of his writings as well when we come back stay with us I want to salute

[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:59.300]  but this is history happening we're not up here dolling this up to sound alarmist or
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:06.260]  whatever i have to pinch myself when i realize how serious this is and like i said a lot
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:10.780]  of times i just laugh at it even when the stuff is gone in my life and i'm not really
[01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:14.540]  at liberty to get into a lot of it but it's it's over the top okay it's stuff like you
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:18.380]  hear about movies but except you laugh at the people that are doing it i think that's kind
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:24.340]  of the good news is all the scum they've sent after me act and look like mentally ill people
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:29.940]  it doesn't matter that they work for intelligence agencies or big tax free foundations they've
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:34.940]  got the little secret agent card they never gone out and done anything real so as scary
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:40.500]  as they are these are not the professionals and i just have to tell you i was in dc the
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:47.260]  police the secret service last week all listeners i mean all listeners and i'm not bragging
[01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:52.860]  i'm saying that's good intel that the police and military are really awake about what's
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:57.340]  happening they understand there's foreign interest manipulating the country they understand
[01:48:57.340 --> 01:49:02.740]  that arrogant interest try to overthrow an election try to stop an election and the public
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:06.380]  i think understands that and sees there's a border crisis and really sees that this
[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:10.460]  country is in 21st century war without me asking the questions and just getting back
[01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:13.860]  to our guest larry c johnson who's one of the only other people other like colonel
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:18.620]  shaffer who we had on like two years ago three years ago who laid out that there was an ongoing
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:25.700]  attempt at coup and now it's been proven the mindset of the leftist and the and the stay
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:30.220]  behind groups and what they're planning now because now this is all come out and as you
[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:34.140]  said trumps big failing as he didn't clean them out early because i don't think he understood
[01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:38.580]  it he wasn't from government he got lied to but but what is here's a better question
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:43.220]  what does the president need to do now in your expert view in your your research view
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:47.940]  talking to others what's the best thinking on that and then let's look at the enemy
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:55.900]  the the mentally ill scrap feeders of globalism that think they're maybe conquering something
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:59.980]  by trying to overthrow the country to turn it over to multinationals i mean quantifying
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:06.220]  your own words without me putting words in your mouth just the epic moment we're in
[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:12.580]  the first thing he needs to do is declassify all of the relevant documents even intelligence
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:20.100]  information nsa documents documents passed from liaison services like gchq human intelligence
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:26.460]  documents the five awards he classified all publish it get it out there because it's going
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:30.860]  to be this kind of sunlight that's going to be required to disinfect this filth really
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:37.180]  which has dirtied up the american political system that's number one number two to go
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:42.700]  after and start rooting out these hold mama holdovers that have been allowed to stay i
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:49.620]  give you a case in point a woman named tina cat now tina used to be the ambassador at
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:55.060]  large for counterterrorism in the bureau of counterterrorism when and she was on diehard
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:51:01.540]  hillary support i mean diehard when trump came into office they allowed her to become
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:06.060]  the head of political military affairs of state they can make the argument that that
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:11.020]  was just the internal state doing its own thing but then it was compounded where she
[01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:15.580]  resigned from the foreign service and the trump administration appointed her to a senior
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:20.740]  position at do d i mean now this is crazy you know i know trump likes to play the role
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:25.420]  of being a tough guy that hires and fires people but the no the truth is he doesn't
[01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:30.300]  know any of this he has ideas he wants to be president he's just trusting his adjuncts
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:35.700]  and they are selling us out yeah well i don't know who's doing the sellout but all i can
[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:42.300]  tell you is people like tina cat now should not be around in the loud in the trump administration
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:47.380]  she is a pure partisan political hack all right i'm gonna keep interrupting her she's
[01:51:47.380 --> 01:51:51.540]  making so many great points but larry c johnson former c i counterterrorism expert who really
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:57.780]  predicted and and and laid all this out trump has now said he's gonna release the classified
[01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:02.180]  info but just like he said he'd get us out of afghanistan the pentagon told him no don't
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:08.100]  do it to his arm i don't see how it gives up methods and all this stuff to release this
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:12.860]  this was an internal coup i think trump has to do it and he has to know now that if he
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:16.420]  doesn't root these groups out they're not gonna give up so can we speak to that from
[01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:20.980]  what you studied in your sources they don't seem to be giving up they seem to be regrouping
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:26.500]  and trying something to to you to still overthrow this election yeah no this is this is like
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:32.540]  some bad zombie movie they continue to uh to come to come at us and they just need to
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:40.180]  be you know they need to be stopped it is um you know this is the kind of thing that requires
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:44.420]  some tough decisive action and they're they're not giving up but i think what we'll start
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:50.740]  seeing is if the first ones that get prosecuted or indicted uh then they will start turning
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:58.260]  on each other because there is a the self-preservation instinct will kick in and i do have the confidence
[01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:03.900]  that the attorney general bar is going to take this very seriously i think the next
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:09.340]  shoe to drop comes with the inspector general's report armed with that inspector's general's
[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:15.900]  report that will show that jim comey leaked classified material and the likely possibility
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:23.180]  that at that point uh both mccabe and comey themselves will be indicted and put in front
[01:53:23.180 --> 01:53:26.700]  of the grant or their charges will be put in front of the grand jury and will likely
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:34.860]  be returned for misuse of classified information in line to uh the fbi so as that's as that
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:40.380]  starts to happen then i think you're going to see the panic reaction among the conspirators
[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:46.340]  grow even more intense i mean we saw ben roves this week who is national in the national security
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:53.900]  advisor role to uh president obama claiming that he you know he he sounded like the the
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.380]  slave girl and gone with the wind you know he didn't know nothing about birth and no
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:02.500]  baby see i mean he didn't know nothing it was like sergeant schultz and hogan's heroes
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:07.940]  i know nothing i i know i mean you even have like the top people the state department saying
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:14.500]  someone broke into our computer and unmask the spying yeah this and the the the whole
[01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:22.340]  unmasking thing is a further indication that this was an organized effort because to unmask
[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:28.740]  means the names of people had to appear in intelligence reports there are only two types
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:34.620]  of intelligence reports alex one is a piece of signal intelligence from the nsa that's
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:39.980]  produced either by the nsa or from a liaison service like the british or you got a human
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:44.980]  intelligence report which is generated principally by the central intelligence agency those are
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:49.060]  only two types of reports where someone's name is going to show up and when it's a us
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:55.260]  person's name normally in those kinds of reports they do not identify the per individual by
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:55:01.540]  name they'll say person one person two person three whatever so it's once the name is put
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:07.340]  into a report it then allows government officials to come back say who is this but there has
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:11.540]  to be a reason sure and so they've been caught red handed i mean i i think trump now realizes
[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:16.380]  that they've committed so many crimes he must go after them and you've seen hillary saying
[01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:22.460]  arrest trump just last week she's not stopping and and so i i i mean this is going to be
[01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:26.460]  a crisis and i can't believe we're here calmly talking about this this is i think a thousand
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:32.060]  times worse than nixon and and i think it just shows their recklessness that they did
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:36.260]  all this and it shows i don't want to i don't want to have this big shake up i don't want
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:41.260]  to have this confrontation but it has to happen because you just can't leave these frankenstein
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:46.660]  rogue groups that have proven they're crazy just wandering around doing whatever they
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:53.260]  want but it's not like they were really being smart about this or thinking it through like
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:56:00.220]  a professional chess player where they're anticipating moves four or five no it's just
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:04.940]  emotional power grabbing he's he shouldn't have won worse but we have all the emails
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:09.260]  we should be in power we need to get rid of him and and and then they're all panicking
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:13.260]  well there's no russians what are we gonna do oh my god and as you said in earlier reports
[01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:17.820]  i've seen on tv you've actually got hillary and the democrats are selling out to any country
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:23.660]  that'll pay them well and that's follow the money in this that's one of the critical points
[01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:29.820]  the money that was going to the clinton foundation coming out of the uk out of key individuals
[01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:35.380]  in the united kingdom they're also wrapped up in this in its very beginnings there's
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:42.980]  a pretty security firm called hoplitt h a k l u y t and those are mostly retired mi
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:48.500]  six individuals they were they were basically brought on board the hillary clinton campaign
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:56.780]  early on in 2015 to help do opposition research and i think really sort of the root foundation
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:01.900]  of the british spying on the trump campaign began there and that's one of the things that
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:05.860]  needs to be looked into well back in two minutes but just at the end here larry c johnson highly
[01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:11.460]  decorated cia new clindestine counterterrorism expert quantifying in 30 seconds you already

[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:22.420]  all right this is a short segment one more long segment with larry c johnson we've got to get back
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:27.220]  on more often you know the best way to find him is just google larry c johnson simper
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:31.220]  six simper tyranus and the committee of correspondence you can read some of the
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:35.460]  articles there we should post some of his great articles they're excellent but larry c johnson
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:39.860]  joins us and again i like to go back to who two years ago two and a half years ago was laying
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:44.020]  all this out obviously he has a lot of sources he didn't want to give away anything classified but he
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:49.380]  was saying i'd look at this i'd look at that judge napolitano said that it got ignored i said that
[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:54.180]  colonel shaffer said that i had the former head of technical nsa on william benny he just come right
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:01:00.580]  out and say it uh and so now it's all here and i just sit back it's not like i want to fight with
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:06.180]  the democrats of the deep state and the republican blue bloods but but just the brazenness and the
[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:11.700]  arrogance is really i got to say frightening it's like having a loose cannon inside your house that
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:18.020]  could run your kids over gut level where do you think this is all going if if trump doesn't
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:24.180]  really pressure bar but but i think bar realizes how dangerous this is this is truly rogue insane
[02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:32.500]  groups so i think trump has just turned it over to bar what do you think he was smart to select
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:39.300]  bill bar uh when i was in state and counterterrorism office we were closely with barb then who was
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:47.060]  attorney general in 1990 and 91 period on the pan m103 bombing and bill bar played a very critical
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:54.340]  role in helping get that investigation underway and the suspects for it to actually prosecuted
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:02:01.300]  and arrested uh he was also instrumental i know when doing some things with dea at the time very
[02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:08.500]  when my former business partners was uh dealing with bar so he said he gets he gets 35 000 foot and
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:14.180]  10 feet he gets a big picture yeah yeah no he's he's smart he understands how the government works but
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:20.180]  he's also got a lot of integrity he's not one who out the play political games he understands
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:26.580]  that the law is there to be applied fairly unjustly and how big was it a few weeks ago when he said no
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:32.020]  there was spying it's admitted there was spying yeah you know whatever you want to call it counter
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:38.980]  there's you know surveillance uh if there could be legal spine but the issue is and then he got
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:45.140]  right to the heart of it was the spine on the trump campaign done legally or illegally and i think
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:50.500]  the evidence will show very clearly it was done illegally does that go to motive to change the
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:56.980]  election or does it go to how they did it with fake intelligence uh with both uh the fact that
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:03:03.220]  you know the disconnect of christopher steele's dossier being used as the justification for the
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:11.540]  FISA warrant and it's being used as justification at the same time that the fbi is firing christopher
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:18.260]  steele as a clandestine informant how in the world do you get rid of a clandestine informant because
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:24.020]  basically you're saying you no longer trust them but then you go before a federal judge and swear
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:31.780]  that their information is valid and verified i mean that's just a disconnect that that shows
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:39.380]  bad faith on the part of people like homey saliates loretta lynch all members of the senior
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:45.540]  parts of the department of justice and the fbi and the fact that they did not verify that and yet
[02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:54.020]  continue to go back and reference it as justification for spying on carter page carter page is a bit
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:04:00.820]  of a buffoon but carter page did not do anything to jeopardize or hurt the security of the united
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:06.340]  states and the thing people forget it keeps it all russian interfered in our 2016 election
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:13.220]  our people morons the united states and the russians and the former soviet union everybody
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:21.220]  does it spying on each other for 80 plus years engaged in a whole variety of intelligence
[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:26.980]  collection activities designed to influence public opinion so grow up stop acting like a
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:32.740]  bunch of babies and pretending that this thing was somehow new and different it was not new it was
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:38.580]  not different but what it did highlight was a complete it was not the failure of the obama
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:44.660]  administration they made a deliberate decision to weaponize this fact larry c johnson stay there

[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:28.900]  all right final segment with larry c johnson decorated uh cia leader not gonna go over his whole
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:34.500]  bio but he goes a lot of national television and he but most importantly he he laid out two years
[02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:38.340]  ago on the show and other shows what was really going on the illegal spying the attempt at coob
[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:45.940]  but i know that the deep staters uh over the carny endowment the ford endowment of the stay
[02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:51.780]  behind networks to use their words the embeds um listen and watch this show and they wondered how
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:55.140]  we knew what they were doing what they're up to while i interview all the experts i've studied
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:07:01.860]  history obama signed this countering disinformation and foreign propaganda act they then called me
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:06.740]  a russian agent in congressional hearings and the house armed services committee i then started
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:12.420]  enjoying the counter espionage operations they were running against me because i'm a loyal american
[02:07:13.220 --> 02:07:17.140]  and so i really got put in the deep end even though i'd historically studied this i got to
[02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:22.500]  experience it and i couldn't believe how their agents and their operatives were like mental
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:29.380]  patients they actually shook in fear around me and believed i was the devil so we've got a big
[02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:34.580]  leg up on these people they have mental patients folks they don't have serious focused people and
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:38.980]  i'm not claiming i'm just as a regular organic citizen mr tough guy but i mean i know how to
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:43.620]  tie my shoelaces i don't you know sit there and you know get the shakes when i got to do something
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:49.460]  and so i'm not saying oh we're superior i'm actually scared that the democrats in the deep
[02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:55.460]  state the ones that did this are so unprofessional so scared so arrogant so pathetic because they're
[02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:59.540]  scared but they're also super arrogant so i know a big part of you encounter terrorism and is one
[02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:04.420]  of their you know top guys have to know what the establishment's doing or your enemy and understand
[02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:09.380]  their psychology correct me if i'm wrong but i think i'm more scared because they're so incompetent
[02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:14.100]  they've been caught there's no way even trump if he wanted to cover this up can they i think they've
[02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:19.540]  got to be prosecuted but then in that process they've never sued for peace they just keep attacking
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:25.300]  attacking so trumps even more forced to and then i'm afraid they're going to do things that could
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:30.260]  could you know sabotage us military operations i already talked to pentagon folks that said
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:35.060]  early on that somebody was leaking where special operations was going to make trump look bad in
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:41.060]  raids against isis uh and so that's i think turned the military completely against obama and illy
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:47.540]  but that's what i'm saying though how many of these things how many air force cadet commandants to
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:52.100]  have to get caught you know staging false flag race war how much do we have to put up with these
[02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:57.700]  crazy people so correct me if i'm wrong and then get into what is their mindset and what is your
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:02.340]  warning to them because you're really talking to the deep state rogue elements on the show as you
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:06.180]  know that's why you were openly earlier saying get rid of this person or that person they're
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:10.900]  watching they're listening so maybe like like you're the fbi bullhorning into a group of bank
[02:09:10.900 --> 02:09:15.140]  robbers give up you'll never get out i mean what do you say to these people to get them to stop
[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:23.300]  but it's important for your listeners to understand alex that this entirely this relies entirely
[02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:30.020]  upon the veil of intelligence so the intelligence that was initially collected by the british
[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:38.820]  and then later collected by nsa and cia it was all contrived it wasn't based out of actual actions
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:46.580]  instead it was done in sort of a is a pretext or designed to paint trump as having interactions
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:52.020]  with the russians sure to discredit the election and and cover for their criminal activity yeah
[02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:58.020]  and and and so we yet within this the fbi participated as well when you look at the case
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:04.020]  of philix satyr for example who was played a critical role in the trump tower moscow project
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:08.980]  in fact he was the one instigating and doing the negotiation encouraged meetings with putin
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:15.780]  what you realize he had been an fbi informant since 1998 and his status as an informant he
[02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:21.940]  was signed up by none other than andrew weissman now that's not just a mere coincidence so what
[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:28.580]  so what they accounted on was they could justify their actions as a counterintelligence investigation
[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:33.140]  because they had quote intelligence that was leading them to do this but what they didn't
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:39.700]  admit to is that that intelligence was actually produced in response to requests from the clinton
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:45.780]  campaign initially and people affiliated with the clinton campaign to come up and start doing
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:52.100]  opposition research on donald trump but then to add the sort of the added flavor of having it appear
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:57.780]  as if it was legitimate intelligence and you saw that in that clip uh that was played with eveline
[02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:03.060]  farkas the former do d official where she said we got all this intelligence showing these contacts
[02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:10.340]  with russia and again she was lying in that what they were not telling the people listening to her
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:16.340]  is that those contacts with russians were staged staged by people live by groups like
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:21.460]  the military intelligence mi6 and explain that to people these were double and triple agents well
[02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:25.780]  known to everybody who they would then call russians who were really western intelligence or
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:30.260]  cutouts making contact with people who never made deals you know i'm so proud that they even have
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:36.340]  to admit no american would take the money including me no american would take the money they couldn't
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:42.260]  get anybody who was a nationalist to sell out right and you know take the case of uh george
[02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:48.980]  poppadoff he was approached by a professor joseph mesud and mesud is characterized in even in this
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:56.500]  this very disingenuous Mueller report as a russian agent when in fact mesud has a long
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:12:03.220]  extensive contacts with both the british mi6 and the us central intelligence agency
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:09.220]  he was a western intelligence asset he was not working for the russians he was working for
[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:14.820]  western intelligence agencies and yet he was the one that presented george poppadoff with
[02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:19.700]  hey opportunities to meet with Putin and hey opportunities to get involved with russia
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:26.340]  and that was a deliberate provocative or provocation it's like baiting a hook and throwing it out
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:30.820]  there hoping that the fish will bite so you can reel him in and then blame the fish for getting
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:34.260]  caught sure it's total entrapment and so none of it worked and why do you think muller than had
[02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:39.300]  to back down because he came up so empty yeah because there was no there there i mean this
[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:44.180]  you know i was saying two years ago that this was a lie and this was based on nothing that this was
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:50.980]  an actual contrived effort and everyone said oh it's crazy and conspiracy theorists but there
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:58.660]  was no there there and when you when people begin to understand that the apart from philly sader
[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:05.460]  who is a 20 year fbi informant working in the trump tower since 2003 henry greenberg another one
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:11.060]  that made approaches to michael caputo and to roger stone was also an fbi informant when you
[02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:18.020]  begin to realize that the fbi was actively using informants to try to entrap trump people and as
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:22.500]  you said everybody knows that who's informed you read the report they act like these and
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:27.940]  that are known informants are fsb agents it's insane so i know you don't like to grandstand
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:33.540]  but i'm serious the time we have sir larry c johnson former cia counterterrorism what would
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:37.300]  you say to the deep state or what do you think they're thinking right now they've got to know the
[02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:42.900]  walls are closing in they kept saying that about trump no they're closing in on them i don't think
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:49.060]  they fully realize or appreciate that the walls are going to completely close in on them i think
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:53.220]  they're counting on the fact that they still got some buddies and some friends on the inside that
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:14:00.020]  will help deflect and diffuse this but uh it's incumbent upon trump as i noted earlier release
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:06.900]  the documents declassify this information exposed to the american public start the prosecution and
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:12.660]  they'll fall like dominoes yeah these are traders there's no other these are genuine traders people
[02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:18.260]  like jim clapper john brennan they are absolute traders they were engaged with sedition and they
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:24.340]  tried to disrupt a legitimately elected president simply because they didn't like his politics or
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:29.620]  his policies but he was voted for by the american people not you know you you're a you're a but
[02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:33.620]  when i say conservative what you say is conservative and watch you on the air for six seven eight years
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:39.620]  and you did accurately all this out and i know you got to go but you just saying they're traders
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:44.340]  this is absolute traders we've got to do something you're totally right and i just can't believe we've
[02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:50.980]  gotten in this position yeah it's you know this is this is the stuff that civil wars are made of
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:56.900]  and uh the you know what what has made america you know america's had its flaws and they've
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:01.780]  been mistakes over the years you know we saw it with the hollywood blacklist period and i never
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:08.820]  thought we would see the democratic left engage in the same tactics that they accuse and uh the
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:14.740]  republicans of doing in the 1940s and early 50s but here we are with the democrats being
[02:15:14.740 --> 02:15:19.060]  more mccarthyite than anything that joseph mccarthy did back in it all right well listen
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:23.300]  larry c johnson i want to invite you to fly to austin i'll fly here i love to have you in studio
[02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:27.540]  i know you've got to go you've been very gracious but since you bring up civil war that's what other
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:31.780]  former cga and fb is saying they've now gotten into antifa groups they're actually planning this as
[02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:35.460]  their overthrow of trump do three more minutes with us on the other side then i'll let you go
[02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:39.620]  about you keep bringing up civil war you keep bringing up this climate that's how i think
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:42.180]  they're going to strike back and i think that's how they're saying they're going to strike back
[02:15:42.180 --> 02:15:46.180]  so just briefly on the side put bookends on this about the clear and present danger because i don't
[02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:49.220]  think they're going to give up and i think you're saying the same thing that's where i was going

[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:36.740]  operative commander counterterrorism specialist i'm going to go over his whole awards and
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:41.460]  decorated past but he's one of the most cogent focused accurate people the last two plus years
[02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:46.820]  that i was watching saying what was really going on was going to come out and again i'm not one of
[02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:51.620]  these people that dreams of civil war and going out and getting the left the lefties i mean i'm
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:58.020]  not even a right winger i'm just a populist but when i go out in public sometimes in austin
[02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:01.060]  most people shake my hand but others say we're going to kill you we're going to get you they
[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:06.260]  they attack me they think they're allowed to do that they're at a crazed level and then i get all
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:11.140]  these fbi reports i don't just believe fbi reports some are true some aren't i've well i'll just say
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:16.020]  it we've infiltrated anti-fagrobe showbiz knows that well they're like we're going to put people
[02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:20.340]  in camps and we're going to have a race war and we're going to link up with ms-13 i said that
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:24.740]  over a year ago the media freaked out and then now you've got other cia former analysts like
[02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:29.060]  kevin schipp basically saying everything that our guest larry c johnson's saying that they're
[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:34.740]  planning a violent overthrow they want it they're buying full-page ads saying and i don't think
[02:21:34.740 --> 02:21:39.380]  antifa is going to lead this overthrow of trump but i think they could be the trigger for real
[02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:44.260]  civil unrest and i just think if we know this is coming we have a duty to stop it this isn't free
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:48.980]  speech so you talk about the climate being perfect for a civil war can you speak to that and how you
[02:21:48.980 --> 02:21:57.940]  think we can stop it well this this division that's being propagated by the media um i i've never
[02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:02.500]  you know i've been involved with doing media talking at stuff since it started like well
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:10.820]  1995 94 you've been on every chapter carls the jackal and i was on abc cbs nbc ms nbc
[02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:15.620]  i see you on nightline i think like 20 years ago so yeah you've been everywhere i did nightline
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:21.940]  probably eight or nine times so and then am i in this so going back almost 30 years i have never seen
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:29.940]  such a dishonest display i mean deliberate dishonesty on the part of media types uh and
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:36.580]  particularly at msnbc and at cnn but it's it's really going throughout the media no one's actually
[02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:42.980]  trying to be honest about covering the stories now the saving grace is this talk radio like your show
[02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:49.460]  and like rush limbaugh show if you if you compare rush limbaugh show to all the major media as many
[02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:57.940]  people listen to rush limbaugh as watch abc cbs nbc cnn ms nbc and fox news on any given night
[02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:03.780]  think about that the total numbers that that are just listening to rush as an example are
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:08.500]  comparable to what's going on the television by the way before they censored us we were at that same
[02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:15.380]  level yeah so that's what i see your show and other shows it gets out there and it counters
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:19.700]  the argument they can't control it they want to try to control it the way they try to control it
[02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:24.980]  just by destroying you by destroying your reputation and by trying to characterize you as a complete
[02:23:24.980 --> 02:23:29.780]  crank so i mean that's that's how they do i've been called a complete conspiracy theorist and
[02:23:29.780 --> 02:23:33.380]  no i saw you've been totally vindicated so what does the corporate media do as they lose all
[02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:37.940]  credibility now they they're losing the little bit of ratings they had or gone well and then they
[02:23:37.940 --> 02:23:44.740]  ignore you so they ignore this story and it's just but it's what what's important in all of this is
[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:49.460]  that we continue to hammer on the truth get the truth out there get the facts out there get the
[02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:54.660]  documents out there because at the core in america there are people who are willing to be persuaded
[02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:59.540]  by facts but they need to be educated and they need to be taught and i don't think i totally agree
[02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:03.700]  let me say this in closing here's my concern i think you have criminal elements because people
[02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:08.340]  say well you got the CIA on you say the CIA is bad no it's like anything there's good people bad people
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:13.620]  do you follow the constitution do you not it's what sides you're on i think you're on the americana
[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:16.900]  side just on the free market side on on the constitution side and correct me if i'm wrong
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:24.500]  yes but people don't seem to understand if the deep state criminal elements continue to be this
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:29.620]  wild they're going to lead into something where people are forced to do really drastic things
[02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:34.420]  and i think they've taken our our calmness and our restraint as witness and i've studied history
[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:39.380]  look at all the tea leaves here larry i i i mean i say to the establishment the corrupt elements of
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:44.740]  it this way leads doom i mean i what do you see in your crystal ball in closing if they're able to
[02:24:44.740 --> 02:24:48.820]  trigger the race war the civil war that are in wiki leaks that the democrats are dreaming of that
[02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:53.220]  that netflix is pushing that they that they think is going to turn all this around i don't think they
[02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:57.860]  can put humpy dump me back together again i think they can only summon the whirlwind that will
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:03.060]  destroy them and i don't want to be in the middle of that yeah well unfortunately i think if history
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:08.820]  teaches us anything it's going to require some sort of external prices to bring us back together
[02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:14.100]  and at this point we're we're still on a collision course where the divisions that are being
[02:25:14.100 --> 02:25:19.860]  encouraged and promoted by many in the media many win hollywood uh that uh they're they're creating
[02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:25.220]  a mem of of a deep dark division in america and yet as a core in america there's a good heart
[02:25:25.220 --> 02:25:29.540]  there is and there are people who are willing to come together and i i still believe in and
[02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:36.100]  trust that that element can be touched and and coalesce and plus the reality is most of them
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:40.420]  have guns and the folks advocating this other don't so well here's my final question i really
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:44.020]  appreciate your time and i hope you write a book so we can plug it you're really a selfless patriot
[02:25:44.020 --> 02:25:48.980]  out there i guess for everybody's own interest but you saw brennan clapper i'm sure three weeks ago
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:54.100]  do the tour saying okay we did watch trump because you know he's a russian or whatever we're still
[02:25:54.100 --> 02:26:00.660]  putting that lie on we were ordered by obama declaring executive privilege executive operation
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:05.140]  i think that shows that they know they're caught and they're desperate now i think that's a big deal
[02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:11.300]  yeah it's a very big deal clapper was sort of the range in chief on the intel side behind
[02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:17.300]  this not brennan but brennan was a willing participant and was an enthusiastic participant
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:22.500]  the brennan's failing is just not very bright he's sort of a dummy and always has been just a
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:28.580]  mediocre intellect but likes to think that he's really smart but clapper was over all 17 agencies
[02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:35.460]  he was really able to yeah clapper clapper is a much more devious devious character and i was
[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:42.100]  excuse me instrumental in in helping who does he work for from your sources or what makes him tick
[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:47.220]  i mean i mean we know that brennan's a communist and just as an idiot well what makes clapper tick
[02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:52.980]  clapper is just a very much a self-server and then serving his own own interests
[02:26:52.980 --> 02:26:57.620]  and he figured that there was some political benefit to be derived by hitching his wagon
[02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:03.540]  to the hillard clinton train uh but that has that's failed him it's how could they get themselves
[02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:07.860]  out of this i keep seeing last question you're a smart guy though how do they couldn't they sue
[02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:12.420]  for peace with trump but i guess they can't be trusted no they will soon for peace won't be an
[02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:16.660]  option what they're gonna try to do is claim that all of that if trump goes forward with this he's
[02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:21.780]  going to damage us intelligence and us security by exposing intelligence sources and methods
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:27.220]  they're going to try to hide hide behind that and play that card so bottom line we're in for some
[02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:31.700]  major fireworks i would call this the most critical time in us history since its founding
[02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:36.980]  that's accurate statement yeah no i think so the next three months are going to be extremely crucial
[02:27:36.980 --> 02:27:42.260]  because the report from the inspector general horowitz is coming out and then trump is supposed
[02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:47.540]  to start to classify in all of this information and when it comes it's going to be a fly all right
[02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:52.100]  larry c johnson i wish you i mean i know you like to subscribe to have your work how do people

[02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:45.860]  told you about this week and all the stuff that happens i just always see one door closes another
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:52.180]  door opens and i it's our mission to stay in the 2020 election and to get trump back in to keep his
[02:34:52.180 --> 02:34:56.340]  feet to the fire to restore the republic and i tend to keep invoars going after that because it'll
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:35:04.820]  always be work to do but i i would love to retire like bill bow backins uh the ring of mordor carrying
[02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:10.740]  around in my pocket is not a very fun thing today let's just leave it at that uh and i just i just
[02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:17.540]  want to halfway get the country back on even keel so it's not total crisis mode but i can't recede
[02:35:17.540 --> 02:35:23.620]  into the shadows even though i've done 25 years of this because they are literally trying to destroy

[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:37.380]  understand that i would never sell you something that i didn't think was the best and that i don't
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:43.700]  use yes i'm a very superstitious person i'm so superstitious it's not like something i
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:52.660]  have in an external capacity like oh i i read books on superstition or uh i i study superstition
[02:35:52.660 --> 02:36:01.140]  i don't study anything in books i'm superstitious i've never started to fight i've never stolen
[02:36:01.140 --> 02:36:05.700]  from anybody other than beer out of golf carts when i was a teenager and i'm the same with that
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:08.740]  and i've never gotten off on screwing someone over
[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:15.620]  but i have enjoyed it when somebody's beaten that lot of me to get that left hook in and
[02:36:15.620 --> 02:36:22.580]  and break their jaw and get them off me the joy of victory the joy of defense but i just want
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:28.100]  listeners to understand something we are the center of the storm you are you're the americans
[02:36:28.100 --> 02:36:32.180]  they fear you're the people that through the thousands of choices tens of thousands of choices
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:39.780]  hell millions of choices online you chose info wars you you you've dialed in and now you see the
[02:36:39.780 --> 02:36:46.580]  proofs in the pudding and it's just like our products i mean i'll tell you the one product
[02:36:46.580 --> 02:36:51.620]  we have that is not the best there is i'll tell you it because i'm just not that skilled at it
[02:36:51.620 --> 02:37:00.260]  it's our t-shirts some of our t-shirts are really good some of our t-shirts are okay
[02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:07.300]  a lot of t-shirts i designed suck and that's because i can't figure out how to come up with
[02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:12.660]  good ideas like mark dice these t-shirts are awesome go buy some seriously support it they're all
[02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:18.820]  genius but everything else i can go to the top scientists top companies top reviews and i can
[02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:26.660]  bring you the best supplements my t-shirts are not the best some have really nice fabric and are
[02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:33.140]  you know the top five percent but they're not the best our turmeric bodies is the best our
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:40.100]  fish oil is the best you're gonna find out there our ultimate bone broth formula is the best our
[02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:47.060]  neutropic is the best unless you spend two hundred dollars a bottle the industry when i put out
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:53.140]  brain force four years ago got so angry because it's it's a copy of some of the top brands out
[02:37:53.140 --> 02:37:57.060]  there i mean not a total copy but we made it stronger and better they were selling it for
[02:37:57.060 --> 02:38:02.980]  a hundred dollars eighty dollars a bottle i made the industry drop brain pill neutropics like turbo
[02:38:02.980 --> 02:38:07.380]  force from an average of eighty bucks down to about sixty because we offered it forty always
[02:38:07.380 --> 02:38:13.060]  discounted twenty nine ninety five nobody puts ten dollars a product in something like this they
[02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:18.420]  put two dollars in it and mark it up seven times i don't do that i tell you exactly what's going on
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:26.020]  so that's what i'm getting at here is everyone needs to understand that the water filtration
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:29.620]  people say well you see you have the best water filtration you sell five different types
[02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:34.740]  well one is the best shower one is the best bath there are two or three gravity feds that you
[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:39.460]  could argue one's better at this one better at that i sit there and look at the big toxicity studies
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:43.220]  and you know one's better at this and one's better at that but it's all nine nine nine nine
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:50.100]  nine percent reduction so alexa pure pro is great pro pure is great we've got the biggest
[02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:55.700]  sales ever going on alexa pure pro right now so if it's air filtration here's how my brain works
[02:38:55.700 --> 02:39:02.500]  you can buy a six stage ion electrical filter that's a thousand dollars you can buy four stages all
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:06.900]  day long for five hundred bucks they used to be six hundred seven hundred alexa pure breeze is
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:12.020]  normally two fifty that's a great deal i make fifty sixty bucks they make fifty sixty bucks
[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:17.780]  when they discount it i make like thirty bucks they make nothing at one hundred ninety nine
[02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:22.260]  dollars i'm making like forty bucks they're making like twenty bucks now we sell a lot more of them
[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:26.740]  because you know it's a great deal it's a four stage ion filter could you spend a thousand and get
[02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:34.580]  better yeah not much better so that's what i'm getting at here is my philosophy and what i stand for
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:42.180]  and how we fund ourselves and what we do that the only thing we produce that is not the best on the
[02:39:42.180 --> 02:39:49.700]  market at a lower price is the t-shirts i mean technically shortwave radios go up and down in
[02:39:49.700 --> 02:39:54.580]  price all the time so maybe we don't last time a year ago i set deals on seeds we had the best
[02:39:54.580 --> 02:39:59.940]  deals in the industry maybe they're not now the point is i'm trying hard here and i make it easy
[02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:05.460]  to support us if i was selling a coffee cup for a hundred bucks like a mug club like like uh
[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:09.540]  steven crowder buy the damn thing it doesn't matter it costs you make bucks like mug he's got to pay
[02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:17.060]  that old crew we sell mugs for fifteen bucks and i'm not in competition with crowder i'm saying
[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:24.660]  i can't stop neurotically giving you the best deal i can because i can't not do it and i got
[02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:30.340]  warned by marketers they said listen you keep discounting stuff 40 50 percent people are gonna
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:35.700]  only buy when you do that and it's fine if you mark up stuff seven times but you don't mr jones
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:43.460]  you're not gonna run this operation making 10 20 on the product and it's true and i've walked
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:50.580]  myself into that situation and i don't know how to unwalk it with the audience so there is no
[02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:55.140]  marketing here there is no advisors there i've tried to have meetings i've tried to figure it out i
[02:40:55.140 --> 02:41:00.660]  just can't stop what i'm doing i just believe in you and i know they even had vice magazine do a big
[02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:04.820]  study and i knew they'd always pick one product say was good look reasonable and attack all the
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:09.620]  others it was all bs except what they said god this is like the best coffee we ever drank well i
[02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:14.260]  mean i went out and found the top rated coffee from southern mexico and chiapas that's that's
[02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:20.500]  beyond organic it's handcrafted handpicked and i love it and then i discounted ten dollars less
[02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:26.820]  a pound than whole food sells it that's what we're doing and so right now you can get x3
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:33.780]  for free the great iodine supplement the missing link when you get a bottle of x2
[02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:39.780]  25 off and listen i couldn't get the deep earth mining operations to give us to us anymore they
[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:43.860]  found who we were they wanted like you know equivalent like 30 bucks a bottle to do it instead
[02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:48.580]  of like 10 bucks a bottle we couldn't do it so i played guts ball and said screw you i finally
[02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:53.140]  found another company they could get the very same deep earth crystals but then they convinced me
[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:56.820]  they said listen we think your stuff's a little strong you know the FDA says you can do this
[02:41:56.820 --> 02:42:01.780]  you should put in two different types of iodine for tri iodine to make sure all of it's absorbed
[02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:07.220]  i could have had x3 be x2 and be the same crystals i really thought it would be better
[02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:13.460]  because i was told so doesn't matter you want x2 you get x2 it is stronger be careful
[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:21.060]  the point is x3 free bottle you get a bottle of x2 and i'm going to explain to you again
[02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:26.020]  all your hormones everything is built off this this is the missing link this is the engine

[02:45:06.980 --> 02:45:11.220]  don't normally take vitamins at all i was turned on to the ultimate female force i looked at all
[02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:15.860]  the ingredients and they're all organic root things like that that i trust you know because
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:19.860]  i've seen a lot of other vitamins they don't have things that they say that they have in them and
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:23.140]  they're often not things that are natural i appreciate that well what happened with ultimate
[02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:26.900]  female force tell us about it well it's really great you know it's like a multi vitamin i take it
[02:45:26.900 --> 02:45:31.620]  it tastes good it doesn't have that nasty aftertaste it actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and

[02:45:46.100 --> 02:45:51.380]  things and ultimate female force so i'm glad you plugged it in four store dot com or triple eight
[02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:58.820]  two five three three one three nine i want to say brain force is great i want to say
[02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:05.380]  turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it
[02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:09.700]  the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is
[02:46:09.700 --> 02:46:15.700]  liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:19.780]  got the adults you've got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the fish oil and the
[02:46:19.780 --> 02:46:23.940]  children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees but krill oils is the best and it'll
[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:27.780]  give you the damn burps and i'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free
[02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:32.500]  the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view i'm not a medical statement here but let me
[02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:37.220]  tell you something i eat five capitalets of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus
[02:46:37.220 --> 02:46:48.420]  that night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit
[02:46:48.420 --> 02:46:52.420]  off of it but you notice i just obsessed because whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:47:08.340]  to you i just can't do it you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:26.340]  well you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes and the chauffeur drives
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:39.540]  your cars you let everybody know but don't play with me because you're playing with fire oh the
[02:47:39.540 --> 02:48:05.700]  angie will say they're going to target conservatives at their homes all right millie we were joining
[02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:09.700]  this her and the great katlyn bennett have been out following incredible reports info wars dot
[02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:13.460]  com and news wars dot com and you got to go to their youtube channels they're their own reporters
[02:48:13.460 --> 02:48:21.700]  as well they just do work for us and there's like an hour of video there's a showing by might have
[02:48:21.700 --> 02:48:26.420]  had 400 people she's got that exclusive footage we got to get an article out about that they've
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:29.940]  got them trying to arrest katlyn bennett for no reason again last time that happened two weeks
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:35.060]  ago i've got 50 million views except for that now uh there's all this insanity so we're gonna tom
[02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:39.540]  pappard's coming up about 15 to the next hour one of our tv station managers great talk show host
[02:48:39.540 --> 02:48:44.260]  but he's happy to let us take over because i got millie on late millie um this is his first big
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:48.900]  rally in ohio his second rally his first rally i know he had part of his brain removed from a
[02:48:48.900 --> 02:48:52.740]  stroke he had i'm not making jokes about that i've had family dies strokes i don't even wish
[02:48:52.740 --> 02:48:57.620]  any harm upon biden even though he's a globalist trader uh but i'm sure you saw him slurring his
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:03.060]  words and i mean this was not drunkenness this was cognitive mental illness or or or mental
[02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:07.780]  degradation of you uh but you were there last night where should we start we've got this big
[02:49:07.780 --> 02:49:14.180]  report got some of the highlights up front what in hades is going on well you know his poor cognitive
[02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:18.900]  health isn't going to stop the establishment from having them as his pick as we saw with hillary
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:25.060]  clinton and i can say from what i've been seeing joe biden is definitely the establishment's pick
[02:49:25.060 --> 02:49:34.980]  well he had at most about 300 attendees go to his rally the building he was in had a 240 occupancy
[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:42.020]  rating and outside the tip is notice how close the camera is oh yeah they they stage the shots
[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:46.500]  they make sure that it looks like he has more support than he does you know i even talked to
[02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:50.660]  some of the vendors that didn't want to be shown because they didn't want to lose their ability
[02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:55.460]  to sell shirts but they said they sell they sell shirts for the democrats and for trump
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:50:01.140]  and they said the numbers aren't adding up there are so few people going to the democrat rallies
[02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:04.660]  and by the way i don't mean to interrupt you but tv viewers may get confused because you
[02:50:04.660 --> 02:50:09.620]  voiced the piece earlier we're playing a moment you show biden about 300 but then you show trump
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:14.820]  shows thousands so i want to be clear that the last clip people saw was uh was was was uh trump
[02:50:14.820 --> 02:50:20.180]  having a big rally yes we're comparing that this is what biden's rallies look like they have to be
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:26.900]  super zoomed in so they don't show he has a small turnout whereas trumps he's filling up mega stadiums
[02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:31.060]  it's tens of thousands of people going to trump rallies whereas you know that by the way millie
[02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:35.700]  you're married i'm married you got two great children i got four but i i do admire you as a
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:40.980]  beautiful smart woman i even weren't so beautiful i still admire you for your great uh tenacity but
[02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:46.100]  i just as a man i'm threatened by you on a 20 foot screen up there actually i love it i just love

[02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:05.060]  i just i actually have a con i got shivers looking at you up there i i love it uh well thank you alex
[02:51:05.060 --> 02:51:11.140]  you know it's crazy being out there with these leptis and i'll tell you the leptis are getting
[02:51:11.140 --> 02:51:16.900]  more and more deranged even after it came out that there was no proof of collusion for trump and
[02:51:16.900 --> 02:51:22.580]  russia they are doubling down they are so mad and you know i i just put up several reports
[02:51:22.580 --> 02:51:27.140]  that was my next question i mean i'll play a time the next hour they're acting more crazy to me on
[02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:33.540]  the street now so so you said you you we got video they are crazy now oh yeah it's escalating a woman
[02:51:33.540 --> 02:51:39.380]  threatened me uh i know with katlyn bennett she was recently kicked off of a college campus just
[02:51:39.380 --> 02:51:45.540]  for being there uh people called the police on her i mean the left is only escalating they're
[02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:49.380]  getting more and more crazy we're going to play some of this coming up next hour it's all on
[02:51:49.380 --> 02:51:54.180]  enforce.com but you're a veteran of charlesville you're a veteran of hundreds of these for you to
[02:51:54.180 --> 02:52:01.220]  say it's escalating describe how you say it's escalating well your average run-of-the-mill
[02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:08.660]  regular you know cat lady is getting more and more hyped up i'm not saying that anteep is out there
[02:52:08.660 --> 02:52:14.820]  but your average american is getting more emotionally invested and more emotionally incontinent
[02:52:16.100 --> 02:52:21.380]  they can't contain themselves they're starting to they're doubling down and because of that
[02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:28.100]  they're holding on to um lies and misinformation and they're just basing their opinions on
[02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:32.900]  emotion so it's kind of dissonance as you said emotional incontinence i mean that's it they're
[02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:41.140]  just they're going crazy yes and a lot of them were full of misinformation about you alex jones
[02:52:41.140 --> 02:52:45.860]  uh i know that they had said so many different things about you that just absolutely wasn't
[02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:51.860]  true i mean these people don't believe certain things i mean just as much as they have misinformation
[02:52:51.860 --> 02:52:56.900]  well i remember ten years ago in pittsburgh a white supremacist killed three police officers
[02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:01.620]  and then the southern private law center got his computer he visited my site amongst thousands
[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:05.300]  and it later came out on his message board he said i want to get alex jones i want to kill alex
[02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:11.220]  jones the left chance now their new thing is i killed three police officers and and i guess
[02:53:11.220 --> 02:53:15.060]  they were chanting that at you even though when they actually got his computer they found he was
[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:21.460]  saying he wanted to kill me oh yeah this guy hated you he was not one of your fans and supporters
[02:53:21.460 --> 02:53:27.140]  and at the same time these are the same leftists that want to try to say hey you know um you know
[02:53:27.140 --> 02:53:34.420]  islam isis isn't encouraging a bunch of terrorism right they'll defend isis and islam but they won't
[02:53:34.420 --> 02:53:40.820]  but at the same time they say oh you can't make those associations when we when we call out um
[02:53:40.820 --> 02:53:47.300]  isis but yet they're gonna make these associations with alex jones who this guy hated you alex that
[02:53:47.300 --> 02:53:51.140]  we're gonna we're gonna play some of this coming up but i just while you're here i want to have
[02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:57.140]  you be able to break it down um you're tough you've been pepper sprayed by the left you've been attacked
[02:53:57.140 --> 02:54:01.460]  you've seen all these new videos of antifa attacking people a whole bunch of former cia counter
[02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:06.020]  terrorism experts and the fb r now officially saying they've been to the meetings i've been to
[02:54:06.020 --> 02:54:10.900]  them that's how we first broke it last year antifuzz linked up with ms-13 is planning mass killings
[02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:18.020]  show how long until they launch a bunch of charlie manson type stuff well i think antifa
[02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:25.220]  we will start to see the left get worse especially if trump wins in 2020 i really feel like if trump
[02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:32.580]  wins in 2020 we can expect the year of 2020 to be civil unrest the left is going to go insane
[02:54:32.580 --> 02:54:37.620]  oh i agree i think you're gonna see cities burn so they're they're trying to compose themselves
[02:54:37.620 --> 02:54:42.580]  but aren't you proud i don't see this patronizingly i'm serious i'm proud of americans even the bar
[02:54:42.580 --> 02:54:47.220]  report or the Mueller report admits no one would take russian money they couldn't get one american
[02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:52.660]  to do it and they they funded race riot stuff in every city with tv shows and movies and they
[02:54:52.660 --> 02:54:58.740]  couldn't get any black americans to take the bait i am damn proud right now of african americans
[02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:06.340]  yeah i'm proud of americans too and it just goes to show how ridiculous and subversive
[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:11.460]  the mainstream media's claims word that trump is best friends with putin and that he was colluding
[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:15.700]  with them and he's in the kkk when he said why supremacist are terrible and they say that he
[02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:21.780]  says they're great well show us the clip then because you don't have it you damn liars oh but
[02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:25.940]  that's one of the things i i questioned people at this rally and i have an amazing report
[02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:30.820]  up that's the name of your video yeah is uh let me find it here go ahead and tell people about it
[02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:36.420]  it's uh it's about how the leftists try to shrug off joe biden's racist past that's the name
[02:55:36.420 --> 02:55:43.620]  dem shrug joe biden's racist past so initially i asked them like i say trump has this racist past
[02:55:43.620 --> 02:55:51.380]  where he advocated for segregation in 1975 and get them to condemn it and they're all oh it's
[02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:56.100]  so bad he's so racist he's so vile you know of course he would and then i say well actually that
[02:55:56.100 --> 02:56:00.900]  was joe biden and then i get their responses and they try to like downplay or shrug it off and
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:06.420]  some you know it's interesting to see the the left's double standards essentially where it's
[02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:15.140]  okay that joe biden was advocating for a segregation when he was running in delaware in 1975 i mean
[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:22.420]  let's be clear i mean let's be clear trump was the one then advocating for it and i even agree
[02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:26.580]  with biden it's mean because my grandmother was a republican so was my grandfather he was in
[02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:32.020]  government in east texas they were for desegregation they didn't want to bust all white kids and black
[02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:36.660]  kids to random schools 30 miles away and make them do that they're all for like yeah go to
[02:56:36.660 --> 02:56:41.140]  whatever school you want so i even get where biden came from then but you can't then say
[02:56:41.140 --> 02:56:45.780]  trump's a kkk member when trump was actually for busting and everything else probably even too
[02:56:45.780 --> 02:56:52.740]  liberal for me you can't get away with that it's just not true yeah the liberals will try to say
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:58.260]  anything i think one lady even tried to claim that you know trump's grandfather or father was a member
[02:56:58.260 --> 02:57:02.500]  of the kkk which that's already even been disproved none of that's even true and i mean going back to
[02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:06.980]  that again imagine you're a kid you're three miles from your school you're black or white
[02:57:07.540 --> 02:57:12.980]  why would you be bus 30 miles away sure to desegregate let black kids go to the good white
[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:18.740]  schools but don't make people go 30 miles to their school so i'm not even defending biden but
[02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:22.900]  according to his yardstick of all this he's he's the he's the worst guy in the world
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:30.180]  so millie weaver is always kicking ass just look at her of your tv viewer she's a she's got so much

[03:00:29.700 --> 03:00:32.100]  let's get him back on time to have him back on
[03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:38.900]  he's a little jealous of me his rock show level
[03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:47.380]  i mean obviously mr. muslim likes alphanel's he's much tougher than i am you know ted nudge is an
[03:00:47.380 --> 03:00:52.020]  imposing figure in person he's like this is a real k-band k-man ain't stupid like today he's smart
[03:00:52.660 --> 03:00:54.820]  and psychic let's get serious
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:01.620]  millie weaver's ride the shotgun was for a few more segments than tom papper one of our great tv
[03:01:01.620 --> 03:01:06.260]  station managers and awesome talk shows his own right takes over millie we're gonna play some of
[03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:13.300]  these clips next segment but you know instead of me asking questions i got 50 of them what do you
[03:01:13.300 --> 03:01:17.220]  want to say about what happened yesterday at biden's event and then i'm going to play this clip next
[03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:21.380]  segment of him slurring his words and i was like man he's like he's having a stroke so that family
[03:01:21.380 --> 03:01:26.100]  members of that stroke it's not a joking matter and then and then one of our great researchers
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:30.340]  kid dangles walked in he said you remember he had brain surgery for stroke and had part of his
[03:01:30.340 --> 03:01:38.100]  brain removed like 10 years ago and i was like oh so another thing is he being 75 or whatever but
[03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:43.220]  he's the oldest person ever run for president in a serious capacity uh i just don't think
[03:01:43.220 --> 03:01:48.020]  biden's got what it takes he's older than trump that hadn't been elected millie well you know at
[03:01:48.020 --> 03:01:56.500]  first i was hesitant to come out and tell people that biden had such low attendees at his rally
[03:01:56.500 --> 03:02:03.460]  i mean they're trying to claim that he had at least 600 inside and what i'm telling you right now
[03:02:03.460 --> 03:02:09.620]  alex is he had maybe i mean the building had a capacity of 240 people which sounds about right
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:14.900]  from what i saw and then outside he had maybe 30 people and the reason i'm hesitant to tell people
[03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:20.100]  this is because i don't want republicans and trump supporters to think oh trump's got this in the bag
[03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:25.460]  i can just stay home no they're gonna steal the election exactly they're gonna steal it with
[03:02:25.460 --> 03:02:30.420]  electronic votes illegal alien votes dead people are going to be voting i mean the democrats are
[03:02:30.420 --> 03:02:36.180]  going to steal it so we still need people to get out yeah who's the bad guy that just got killed
[03:02:36.180 --> 03:02:41.300]  in uh i watched with my kids sunday was actually pretty good uh game of thrones who's the ice king
[03:02:41.300 --> 03:02:45.860]  and the light king what's his name oh i don't know i know who you're talking about i don't know
[03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:52.500]  his name i'm proud of our crew what's the name of the bad guy sir and the night king it's like
[03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:58.420]  we think we're gonna win no the democrats have the dead they the night they have the zombie force
[03:02:58.420 --> 03:03:05.140]  you're right the night king yeah they're gonna use whatever means they can to steal the election
[03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:11.300]  we are gonna see that so we still need people to flood the election to support trump essentially
[03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:17.620]  otherwise if we don't we are gonna have joe biden because he is the establishment pick that and i
[03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:21.780]  can already guarantee both most likely bernie sanders is gonna count how to just like last
[03:03:21.780 --> 03:03:29.300]  time both of them talk completely weird one can't talk the other talks like this what are we going
[03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:35.780]  to do i won't control the government to kill christians i love to kill i'm sorry sorry millie go ahead
[03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:42.020]  it looks like many of these leftists who are very set in their ways they don't care who the person
[03:03:42.020 --> 03:03:47.300]  is they're gonna vote whoever is on the opposite end of trump they don't care you mean they do what
[03:03:47.300 --> 03:03:54.740]  they're told that yeah they're just so anti-trump that to them it doesn't matter they're like oh well
[03:03:54.740 --> 03:03:59.700]  i will all vote for any of the contenders as long as it's not trump they don't care that joe biden's
[03:03:59.700 --> 03:04:04.740]  groping women they don't care about it can you imagine if i was in videos like like walking up
[03:04:04.740 --> 03:04:09.220]  people i don't know like grabbing their kids hair and smelling it i mean if somebody that's my kid i'd
[03:04:09.220 --> 03:04:14.580]  punch them that's what and they tried to justify here's an example you bet on my boat with my wife
[03:04:14.580 --> 03:04:18.740]  and i you and your husband and your son can you imagine if i was on a boat with you and i walk
[03:04:18.740 --> 03:04:23.860]  over like rubbing your son's hair and smelling him you wouldn't you kick me in the face or something
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:30.900]  i mean how does it get away with this i don't know i see that's what i the left is willing to just
[03:04:30.900 --> 03:04:36.260]  idolize him and turn the cheek and just say oh that's all fine but you know brit kavanaugh
[03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:43.460]  he drinks you are a racist shut up women need to keep their mouths shut i'm bernie sanders

[03:06:16.500 --> 03:06:25.700]  it is my honor and pleasure to introduce vice president joe biden the next president of the
[03:06:25.700 --> 03:06:32.500]  united states of america practically the smallest amount of people i've ever seen here uh it's not
[03:06:32.500 --> 03:06:39.060]  a big crowd size as compared to many trump rallies that we've seen uh this is typical of
[03:06:39.060 --> 03:06:43.860]  democrat candidates so they don't tend to have as big of turnout this is not a really big venue either
[03:06:43.860 --> 03:06:49.460]  it's a rather small building behind me that was filled up but overall it's interesting because i
[03:06:49.460 --> 03:06:55.300]  talked to all right hit pause hit pause hit pause if you're a radio listener i know millie said that
[03:06:55.300 --> 03:07:03.780]  it's capacity 240 she shows the fire department but my god this is like a 1920s tiny three-story
[03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:09.700]  building they must have had impact in like sardines just to make it look big we're going to continue
[03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:14.900]  the report but this is pathetic if you're a tv viewer you see it radio listeners must go to
[03:07:14.900 --> 03:07:20.660]  info wars dot com uh where we posted her her article i i hope we posted i don't have the site
[03:07:20.660 --> 03:07:27.140]  uh pulled up a dim shrug off biden's racist past i think the angle is media covers up for
[03:07:27.140 --> 03:07:33.940]  trump having less than 200 people this is pathetic let's continue uh this is typical
[03:07:33.940 --> 03:07:38.660]  of democrat candidates so they don't tend to have as big of turnout this is not a really big venue
[03:07:38.660 --> 03:07:44.180]  either it's a rather small building behind me that was filled up but overall it's interesting
[03:07:44.180 --> 03:07:51.060]  because i talked to you back it up to start this you know 10 seconds this is the teams the temple
[03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:56.820]  and it was the teams that signed deals from after and get uh millie we're gonna go back to your
[03:07:56.820 --> 03:08:02.340]  report but this is bombshell that is a tiny building you look like a tp he had a meeting in
[03:08:03.620 --> 03:08:08.260]  yeah you know when i pull up to many of these democrat events i'm like what is going on could
[03:08:08.260 --> 03:08:15.220]  they have picked a smaller venue at trump events it's like super dome stadiums and 10 000 20 000
[03:08:15.220 --> 03:08:21.700]  turned back in helicopters and giant traffic for 20 miles and but with this like oh look at the giant
[03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:27.540]  crowd by the way bony sanders said you're a white supremacist story go ahead
[03:08:28.980 --> 03:08:34.260]  yeah joe biden even held one of his recent ones in a tiny little bar in the middle of
[03:08:34.260 --> 03:08:38.580]  nowhere pretty much i mean these guys are picking the smallest venues to make everyone
[03:08:38.580 --> 03:08:43.540]  crunch in there like sardines so that then they could say yeah we had overflow well you wouldn't
[03:08:43.540 --> 03:08:49.620]  have even had overflow if you had overflow in this phone booth we're going to win so we see
[03:08:49.620 --> 03:08:55.300]  reporters at every event to show their meeting and phone booths and what's crazy is one of the
[03:08:55.300 --> 03:09:00.580]  vendors came up to me and was like man you know that the numbers are just not adding up like you
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:05.620]  go to we we've been to all of them trump hillary even in california they said hillary had low turnout
[03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:12.340]  but are you saying polls are free turning up are you saying biden is not in the lead
[03:09:14.340 --> 03:09:20.020]  i would say you know between biden beto all of them i mean they all had some all turnouts it's
[03:09:20.020 --> 03:09:24.420]  really hard to tell the best part about beto is he'll say something and then two seconds later do
[03:09:24.420 --> 03:09:31.860]  it like i'll tell you i'm angry now you're in trouble is he a robot or something was he even
[03:09:31.860 --> 03:09:42.660]  talks like bernie like and everything's free school health care and free wages and other good
[03:09:42.660 --> 03:09:49.460]  stuff too my name's pedo sorry millie i'm being bad today i just what a freak show that we can
[03:09:49.460 --> 03:09:57.140]  barely defeat this army of retards it's because they're rigging the elections there's literally no
[03:09:57.140 --> 03:10:02.660]  other way that hillary that's it once the city goes blue it never goes back it's proven once it
[03:10:02.660 --> 03:10:08.660]  goes blue it never goes back sorry and then it's another weird neurotic inbred billionaire pissing
[03:10:08.660 --> 03:10:16.020]  on us like pedo so this is a cnn headline joe biden's past 24 hours could not have gone more
[03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:21.380]  perfectly his launch of his campaign is so successful he's he's gonna win he's gonna take
[03:10:21.380 --> 03:10:25.620]  on trump i mean they're literally pushing and pumping him up and if you actually went to
[03:10:25.620 --> 03:10:32.340]  the joe biden rally which i did uh sorry but maybe 300 people showing up doesn't actually
[03:10:32.340 --> 03:10:37.220]  stand a real chance against president trump when i've been to rallies in that exact same neighborhood
[03:10:37.220 --> 03:10:43.940]  of trumps and he had the most insane crowd sizes lying so millie not totally agrees that you've
[03:10:43.940 --> 03:10:48.180]  documented at all what are they gonna do as it comes out that he's a chinese agent got three
[03:10:48.180 --> 03:10:53.220]  billion from him i mean it's coming out i mean this guy is a criminal hardcore criminal he thought
[03:10:53.220 --> 03:10:58.660]  he'd be protected by hillary he's gone so far why don't we let him walk i want to see him again i want
[03:10:58.660 --> 03:11:04.820]  to see i want to see him in a super max prison i we want to see hillary in one too i mean these
[03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:10.260]  democrats seem to be able to commit crimes it's going to be you christian it's going to be you
[03:11:10.260 --> 03:11:18.500]  in a gulag shut your mouth i am superior millie what do you say to bernie and others what do you
[03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:24.820]  see in the campaign little lady well what i see from the liberals which these are going to be the
[03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:31.780]  ones voting so these are who you know we're kind of up against these people do not care their democrats
[03:11:31.780 --> 03:11:37.780]  can be racist can say horrible things can sexually assault people can be these horrible vile people
[03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:43.220]  they're gonna support their person regardless and then they're going to try to criticize the
[03:11:43.220 --> 03:11:48.020]  republican for any little thing they do and act like they don't have double standards and the reality
[03:11:48.020 --> 03:11:53.700]  is is this is all about policy let them you know behind their lies and whatever they try to use their
[03:11:53.700 --> 03:12:01.620]  emotional guilt trips this is all about you are not in the polar bureau young lady you do not set
[03:12:01.620 --> 03:12:09.220]  policy let's go to more of this upstart millie weaver daring to speak down to biden here's more
[03:12:09.220 --> 03:12:15.300]  of her report uh this is typical of democrat candidates so they don't tend to have as big
[03:12:15.300 --> 03:12:19.940]  of turnout this is not a really big venue either it's a rather small building behind me that was
[03:12:19.940 --> 03:12:25.220]  filled out this is a right but overall it's interesting because i talked to some of the
[03:12:25.220 --> 03:12:29.940]  shirt guys who follow around the presidential campaigns and what he said is that he's noticed
[03:12:29.940 --> 03:12:43.620]  that the democrat campaigns have much smaller turnouts so let's go talk to some of these
[03:12:43.620 --> 03:12:51.060]  biden supporters what do you think about biden biden not a fan not a fan why are you here then
[03:12:51.780 --> 03:12:57.300]  i'm here just to see what he has to say anybody to be trump anybody to be trump
[03:12:57.300 --> 03:13:03.540]  but i like joe biden i think he's very intelligent i think he's mature experienced i and i think he
[03:13:03.540 --> 03:13:11.700]  has what it takes to be trump um very impressed with him very impressed he said i liked biden
[03:13:11.700 --> 03:13:15.540]  so what what brings you out here what do you like alex jones what do you work for him
[03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:21.140]  so what what brings you out here well how much does he pay you are you satisfied again
[03:13:21.140 --> 03:13:29.220]  how much does he pay you you're not you want me to talk i will not talk how much does he pay you
[03:13:29.780 --> 03:13:35.700]  let's go back to this well alex that's one of the things that it's hard to hear in there he
[03:13:35.700 --> 03:13:40.900]  actually says how much does he pay you are you sleeping with him so he can say this sexist
[03:13:40.900 --> 03:13:47.460]  remark to me and sit there and act like he's an ally to feminists oh by the way by the way millie
[03:13:47.460 --> 03:13:53.300]  we've shaken hands but i'm i'm in love with your power and your will and your courage
[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:56.500]  and with the great work your husband does i admire you and your family
[03:13:56.500 --> 03:14:00.980]  that's what i'm in love with just like you love what i'm doing how dare him claim when i say i
[03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:05.780]  love a powerful informed woman taking action i tell the whole crew how much i admire you
[03:14:05.780 --> 03:14:12.660]  how dare him boil that down to just sex this isn't about sex no what it is is we all know
[03:14:12.660 --> 03:14:18.260]  that's the case alex of course but this guy is going to essentially he's gonna say you're a sex
[03:14:18.260 --> 03:14:22.740]  object he's gonna say you're not out there because you're a badass reporter who has incredible courage
[03:14:22.740 --> 03:14:26.900]  who's been beat up at pepper spray and called a white supremacist and attacked he's gonna say
[03:14:26.900 --> 03:14:31.700]  you got a job here not because you get 20 million views a month not because you're a badass but because
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:37.220]  you're a woman like i said that's the only reason why a woman would be a reporter right that's the
[03:14:37.220 --> 03:14:42.340]  only reason a woman would actually be out there not because she can hold her own and only a leftist
[03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:50.660]  would think like that i mean exactly exactly yet trump has put more women in his cabinet than
[03:14:50.660 --> 03:14:55.540]  any other president and these guys are the ones who want to say oh trump's a a misogynist he's
[03:14:55.540 --> 03:15:00.340]  sexist all this stuff but then this guy can say sexist stuff time pamphlets coming up in 15 minutes
[03:15:00.340 --> 03:15:04.420]  god bless him i seem to take over time he's gonna host but i love him we'll get him his own show soon
[03:15:04.980 --> 03:15:08.420]  as well as you but you're too busy on the road to your own show we already launched one i want to
[03:15:08.420 --> 03:15:11.060]  come back and have you have the floor and play more of the clips at the end of this but yeah
[03:15:11.060 --> 03:15:18.500]  yeah these weird men going oh why are you with info wars are you having sex with jones i mean i
[03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:23.540]  remember the media put pis on us i've never told the story a few years ago but i think i'm gonna
[03:15:23.540 --> 03:15:27.060]  tell it lian's coming into town this week her grandma had brain cancer that's why she left
[03:15:27.060 --> 03:15:32.020]  her while but they had pis on us and were convinced me and lian were dating never happened i've shook

[03:18:04.340 --> 03:18:09.380]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[03:18:09.380 --> 03:18:15.460]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[03:18:15.460 --> 03:18:19.940]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[03:18:19.940 --> 03:18:25.940]  deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due
[03:18:25.940 --> 03:18:30.740]  to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep
[03:18:30.740 --> 03:18:35.940]  earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research
[03:18:35.940 --> 03:18:41.940]  that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super
[03:18:41.940 --> 03:18:48.180]  charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it

[03:21:34.340 --> 03:21:39.780]  jump in here not to dominate you because i have to keep being comments i noticed people got upset
[03:21:39.780 --> 03:21:44.260]  by that but i mean this is the standard leftist operation why do you think they act like this
[03:21:44.260 --> 03:21:51.780]  yes well i think they're just hypocrites really double standards hypocrisy run rampant within
[03:21:51.780 --> 03:21:59.060]  the left and they can be vile and nasty and mean and they don't care they see that they do no wrong
[03:21:59.060 --> 03:22:04.580]  because they believe that they have the moral high ground because they adhere to these principles
[03:22:04.580 --> 03:22:08.980]  that are being perpetuated through propaganda well you were a contractor seven years ago for us
[03:22:08.980 --> 03:22:14.420]  you've been here for three years you just like royal flush just like katelyn Bennett i mean
[03:22:14.420 --> 03:22:19.220]  it isn't about women or men but i'm actually telling my crew i'm like we need women it's women
[03:22:19.220 --> 03:22:22.900]  that are dominating and not just because you're a woman the stuff you save the stuff you do
[03:22:22.900 --> 03:22:28.980]  what you catch it's that magic and we're trying to hire women versus cnn it's almost all men
[03:22:28.980 --> 03:22:34.100]  it just seems like a virtue signal it seems like pure crap look you know i don't i don't take it
[03:22:34.100 --> 03:22:39.620]  personal a lot of this slides off my back like water a duck's back i mean i don't care because i
[03:22:39.620 --> 03:22:45.540]  know most of these most of these people are crazy okay so who cares what a crazy person says i mean
[03:22:45.540 --> 03:22:50.180]  they were calling you all kinds of things alex i mean they were just making up stuff like just
[03:22:50.180 --> 03:22:56.260]  one of them you just just imagine that i hire women to have sex imagine that i'm actually
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:23:02.820]  hiring women to have sex with them think of how insulting that is well yeah it was really meant
[03:23:02.820 --> 03:23:08.580]  to insult me uh as a reporter out there that's what his aim was i don't think they even believe
[03:23:08.580 --> 03:23:11.940]  half the stuff let's just say it millie because you've got you've got a great husband and two
[03:23:11.940 --> 03:23:16.020]  children and i'm sure that's passionate it's awesome but let's be honest when you get a video
[03:23:16.020 --> 03:23:20.020]  that gets 20 million views you change the course of humanity and you stand up for your children
[03:23:20.020 --> 03:23:25.380]  is that not the highest thrill in your life well you know katelyn Bennett was actually the one who
[03:23:25.380 --> 03:23:31.540]  just recently got the 20 million i think she got like 50 million oh i she just is off the charts
[03:23:31.540 --> 03:23:35.620]  she is really kicking butt but i'm just saying explain to people what really matters i we didn't
[03:23:35.620 --> 03:23:41.300]  script this i mean i just what's your view on that well i mean my view is that you're always
[03:23:41.300 --> 03:23:46.500]  going to have people who are haters or who love what you're doing when you're actually being um
[03:23:47.700 --> 03:23:51.300]  how would i say when you're actually going out there and doing something that's worth doing
[03:23:51.300 --> 03:23:55.540]  you're gonna have people that hate you or love you sure what i'm saying is what are the highest
[03:23:55.540 --> 03:24:01.940]  points in your life probably falling around the hillary clinton campaign and the trump campaign
[03:24:01.940 --> 03:24:07.620]  and testing you're falling down well that too not it's not like it's the highest point in my life
[03:24:07.620 --> 03:24:12.020]  obviously the highest point emotionally no but that's like shooting shooting torpedoes down the
[03:24:12.020 --> 03:24:17.460]  death star mine shaft but sorry go ahead the highest point in my life was actually having my son i
[03:24:17.460 --> 03:24:24.420]  mean that's my moment of like wow i like i just you know i fulfilled my my dreams my hopes and
[03:24:24.420 --> 03:24:29.700]  you know that's the highest point in my life but as far as like my career i would say following the
[03:24:29.700 --> 03:24:35.380]  trump campaign the hillary campaign participating in what happened in 2016 that was just so amazing
[03:24:35.380 --> 03:24:39.380]  and i hope more people will actually get out there and participate in this next upcoming
[03:24:39.380 --> 03:24:44.820]  election exactly they want to penalize people but they can't stop the masses but you just you
[03:24:44.820 --> 03:24:48.740]  just had your new baby too that was powerful but there's nothing like that first baby is her
[03:24:48.740 --> 03:24:55.940]  it's it's it's that first baby i i love my daughter all the same i love her just as much but just
[03:24:55.940 --> 03:25:00.980]  like the right of passage in the mother explain the switches that get flipped how much is your
[03:25:00.980 --> 03:25:08.180]  iq go up when you had that first baby i don't even know if it's necessarily iq it's that my
[03:25:09.140 --> 03:25:16.980]  confidence my strength my authority um my compassion my empathy all of that just got
[03:25:16.980 --> 03:25:21.860]  heightened to where i'm like it sounds cheesy but i'm like some other bears i don't mess with my kids
[03:25:21.860 --> 03:25:27.940]  you know it's like do not mess with you turned into a war machine for humanity yeah and i
[03:25:27.940 --> 03:25:33.460]  tried to project that out there in my work and stand with strength and i'm not intimidated i
[03:25:33.460 --> 03:25:38.660]  intimidated by these crazy leftists that want to scream and yell my face and threaten me because i
[03:25:38.660 --> 03:25:44.100]  know that you know i what i'm doing is right and i'm a person of faith where i believe that god
[03:25:44.100 --> 03:25:48.740]  protects me and looks out for me because i feel like what i'm doing is in a way
[03:25:48.740 --> 03:25:54.260]  some of his work now i totally agree the force is with you let's go back to your huge reports on
[03:25:54.260 --> 03:25:59.220]  info wars dot com uh we we should get to all of it here but uh papper's coming up here here's more
[03:25:59.220 --> 03:26:03.460]  of this guy saying oh you're on info wars because you have sex with alex jones here he is who said

[03:26:13.380 --> 03:26:20.580]  with him that's that's a pretty uh i would say sexist comment to make against a female reporter
[03:26:20.580 --> 03:26:26.980]  that i have to be sleeping with my my boss in order to have a job that's that's pretty low
[03:26:26.980 --> 03:26:33.460]  that's pretty low do you like biden i'm looking at the field and doing my homework what do you
[03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:42.580]  hope to hear from biden today a plan for a future what do you think about donald trump uh what am i on
[03:26:44.100 --> 03:26:54.020]  not very much i think he's uh a piece of work he wants to build the wall um he is anti-immigration
[03:26:54.020 --> 03:27:04.020]  um he uh has produced tax tax cuts for the wealthy um let's pause again wall street gives 99%
[03:27:04.020 --> 03:27:09.940]  their money to hillary they're trying to crush our border and enslave us right now and these people
[03:27:09.940 --> 03:27:15.060]  are just such followers and i'm not being mean but you look at them they're so physically weak
[03:27:15.060 --> 03:27:21.140]  meli like a woman has great intuition about a man or about women have intuition what is your
[03:27:21.140 --> 03:27:25.300]  intuition about leftist when you're around them i don't feel good they're so weak i just feel like
[03:27:25.300 --> 03:27:33.940]  they're dead yeah they're definitely lost i mean i misinformed lost uh aimed in the wrong direction
[03:27:34.580 --> 03:27:39.700]  it's like they're literally just brainwashed and it's like you can trigger them just by saying
[03:27:39.700 --> 03:27:46.580]  things that you know go against the mainstream media's programming essentially uh so it's crazy
[03:27:46.580 --> 03:27:52.260]  to see that these are like lemmings that all want to run off a cliff into the next illery which is

[03:39:12.900 --> 03:39:17.620]  and then we'll just put the ice pick right in the forehead and it'll be totally comfortable and then

[03:39:25.460 --> 03:39:30.260]  to fund your campaign hey what do you think what do you think of the fact that it's coming out that
[03:39:30.260 --> 03:39:36.020]  biden's a chi-com operative you know it doesn't surprise me biden has so many disgusting things
[03:39:36.020 --> 03:39:41.220]  surrounding him if big league politics we had an exclusive story where they actually we we have a
[03:39:41.220 --> 03:39:46.260]  person who came forward biden i should add you're a senior writer at bigleaguepolitics.com a total
[03:39:46.900 --> 03:39:53.780]  badass tell us about this so we have this article where biden's daughter-in-law she runs this lawyers
[03:39:53.780 --> 03:39:58.100]  for needy people organization that's a total sham which means the swindles the cash out
[03:39:58.100 --> 03:40:03.540]  yeah exactly exactly well it turns out we keep them comfortable they had this
[03:40:04.180 --> 03:40:09.380]  1918 year old kid who they were representing another guy and he was called in as a witness
[03:40:09.380 --> 03:40:15.300]  and this lawyer goes into the men's room with this kid and sexually propositions him this
[03:40:15.300 --> 03:40:20.100]  is in joe biden's daughter-in-law's legal group and then they just sweep it under the rug oh this
[03:40:20.100 --> 03:40:23.860]  never happened yeah we're sorry if you were uncomfortable with people associated with biden
[03:40:23.860 --> 03:40:31.300]  are grabbing kids you're telling me bears bears bears live in the woods who could have ever seen
[03:40:31.300 --> 03:40:35.780]  this happening but you know so it doesn't surprise me that he's in bed with china and in fact if you
[03:40:35.780 --> 03:40:40.500]  look at the company he keeps hillary clinton we all know what she does with china we all know what
[03:40:40.500 --> 03:40:46.900]  she does with foreign government so it doesn't surprise me at all pepper you need to join me
[03:40:46.900 --> 03:40:52.100]  throughout the week what's coming up in the next segment here so i thought since we were talking
[03:40:52.100 --> 03:40:56.580]  about biden i wanted to talk about that we've also got kind of i want to give some backstory
[03:40:56.580 --> 03:41:02.980]  about rod rosenstein because this guy has been a bad actor for a very long time he interviewed
[03:41:02.980 --> 03:41:07.860]  hillary clinton way back in the day i'm sorry i think it was president bill clinton all the way
[03:41:07.860 --> 03:41:12.580]  back in whitewater when he was impeached in the house but not the senate of memory serfs and it
[03:41:12.580 --> 03:41:19.060]  was a 15 minute interview it didn't happen where it was supposed to happen and then all these years
[03:41:19.060 --> 03:41:26.100]  later in 2017 when he joined the trump administration he lied on his resume and he said that at the time
[03:41:26.100 --> 03:41:31.220]  that he was interviewing the clinton's about whether or not they broke the law he said that he
[03:41:31.220 --> 03:41:36.580]  was the attorney general for a state chief prosecutor for maryland i think it was so this
[03:41:36.580 --> 03:41:41.220]  guy is a real piece of work he's the same guy i should have led the show and i'm glad you're
[03:41:41.220 --> 03:41:46.900]  going to do this next segment thank god you're here why is the head of the air force academy

[03:47:22.180 --> 03:47:28.340]  welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show i am tom pampered facebook's god
[03:47:28.340 --> 03:47:33.300]  emperor trump thank you all so much for watching today alex is having a lot of fun was that not
[03:47:33.300 --> 03:47:39.860]  some fascinating video the milley weaver got at the joe biden rally and of course biden is now a
[03:47:39.860 --> 03:47:45.220]  vice presidential candidate sleepy joe as president trump calls him he was teasing it for like two and
[03:47:45.220 --> 03:47:50.180]  a half months will he run won't he run and part of me thought that he was going to do a repeat of
[03:47:50.180 --> 03:47:56.500]  2016 where he said one of his biggest regrets was not just hopping in the race but joe biden was
[03:47:56.500 --> 03:48:01.940]  roundly mocked for his really kind of strange speech again we learned from milley weaver 240
[03:48:01.940 --> 03:48:07.780]  people in that crowd president trump says the night before i'm gonna be at such and such arena
[03:48:07.780 --> 03:48:13.620]  20 000 people 10 000 people waiting outside you literally cannot get into the trump rallies if
[03:48:13.620 --> 03:48:18.660]  you're not there three four five hours early standing in line people are camping overnight but
[03:48:18.660 --> 03:48:23.220]  joe biden gets 240 people so therefore he's going to defeat trump is what they what they tell us but
[03:48:23.780 --> 03:48:29.860]  he was roundly mocked as i said we can get into the medical issues that joe biden has had that
[03:48:29.860 --> 03:48:33.940]  might have led to some of his slurring but of course if you do that then they're just going to say
[03:48:33.940 --> 03:48:39.060]  that he's in the best health of his life a la hillary clinton in 2016 where they maintain that
[03:48:39.060 --> 03:48:43.540]  even though she had the weird head motions she couldn't be outside for more than 20 30 minutes
[03:48:43.540 --> 03:48:47.860]  she had three or four days in between speeches they maintain that she was completely healthy so
[03:48:47.860 --> 03:48:53.300]  we'll just totally brush all that aside we've got an article up here at bigleaguepolitics.com
[03:48:53.300 --> 03:48:59.860]  biden's painful slurring campaign speech garners mockery and i have to say i love what our editor
[03:48:59.860 --> 03:49:04.340]  in chief at big league politics patrick howley did here he's got this great way of getting people
[03:49:04.340 --> 03:49:07.860]  it's the opposite of clickbait really you think you're going to be reading this little puff piece
[03:49:07.860 --> 03:49:14.820]  about how joe biden is a disgrace and then bam he hits you with the giant red pill because just
[03:49:14.820 --> 03:49:19.220]  here recently we had a longer article up at big league politics and we talked about this
[03:49:19.220 --> 03:49:25.700]  alex and i did a little bit in the last segment but joe biden's daughter-in-law kathleen biden
[03:49:25.700 --> 03:49:31.140]  operates this weird little group called dc volunteer lawyers project which according to
[03:49:31.140 --> 03:49:36.420]  the person who made the accusation that i'm about to get to it's not volunteer they get paid very
[03:49:36.420 --> 03:49:41.940]  well they they get a lot of money from their clients and from shady resources but allegedly
[03:49:41.940 --> 03:49:49.060]  kathleen biden she has this group and there's this lawyer in it or there was and he was
[03:49:49.060 --> 03:49:55.780]  representing a young child in a custody case the parents the mother wanted to homeschool
[03:49:55.780 --> 03:50:01.620]  the father said homeschooling is bad and so they ring in the lawyers they've got to go before the
[03:50:01.620 --> 03:50:07.300]  judge etc etc etc we all know how this works and the dc volunteer lawyers was supposed to be helping
[03:50:07.300 --> 03:50:11.460]  out the people who wanted to homeschool well they call in a witness who is an older kid he's
[03:50:11.460 --> 03:50:17.060]  graduated from high school he's 18 19 somewhere in that age range and so they bring him in as a
[03:50:17.060 --> 03:50:22.580]  witness to say look i was homeschooled i turned out great i did the best in my my job i've got a
[03:50:22.580 --> 03:50:29.220]  great education after high school etc etc well it turns out this lawyer this is what they're
[03:50:29.220 --> 03:50:36.020]  alleging at least they go the guy testifies they might bring him back in again as is often the
[03:50:36.020 --> 03:50:43.940]  case in court proceedings so he goes to the restroom to relieve himself and this lawyer follows him in
[03:50:43.940 --> 03:50:48.820]  and says you know you're a very fine looking young man you're you're a handsome guy i think you'd be
[03:50:48.820 --> 03:50:52.740]  i think you should do modeling i think you should come over to my house and i'm having this great
[03:50:52.740 --> 03:50:56.820]  house party we're gonna have all kinds of great people there and we really need a a great looking
[03:50:56.820 --> 03:51:01.620]  guy like you and he takes out a business card presumably while they're standing at the urinal
[03:51:01.620 --> 03:51:07.220]  and he writes down his address on there and his contact information on there and he hands it to
[03:51:07.220 --> 03:51:14.740]  this kid and i say kid 18 is legally an adult but in 21st century america is very rare to find an
[03:51:14.740 --> 03:51:19.380]  18 year old who acts and thinks like an adult and your brain isn't even done developing so this kid
[03:51:19.380 --> 03:51:26.100]  walks out of the bathroom and he hands the card to his mom and he relays this weirdo story that he
[03:51:26.100 --> 03:51:32.740]  just encountered and the only thing they can think is that he was propositioning him in the men's
[03:51:32.740 --> 03:51:38.420]  bathroom of a dc courthouse this is the biden family so when alex jones broke the story
[03:51:38.420 --> 03:51:45.860]  earlier today it's up on info wars dot com of course that joe biden has all kinds of china ties
[03:51:45.860 --> 03:51:50.260]  it doesn't surprise me at all of course everybody remembers the clinton administration was essentially
[03:51:50.260 --> 03:51:56.100]  selling nights and what was at the lincoln bedroom to china giving china all kinds of preferential
[03:51:56.100 --> 03:52:01.220]  treatment obama did absolutely nothing to go over to go after china which has been ripping our
[03:52:01.220 --> 03:52:07.140]  country off in intellectual property we have the world's worst unfair trade deals in fact tpp would
[03:52:07.140 --> 03:52:12.820]  have been a disaster for the united states economy and it was pushed by the obama administration they
[03:52:12.820 --> 03:52:18.020]  these globalists and i think it's because they profit off of it clearly these globalists have
[03:52:18.020 --> 03:52:24.100]  absolutely nothing wrong with china becoming the new global hegemon of the planet that's
[03:52:24.100 --> 03:52:29.140]  really what they they think it'll be great let china take over this will be the chinese millennium
[03:52:29.140 --> 03:52:34.180]  chinese have documents from the 90s where they're saying how we will make this the chinese millennium
[03:52:34.180 --> 03:52:39.460]  and the globalists are totally all for it there's no doubt in my mind so i just wanted to get put
[03:52:39.460 --> 03:52:44.420]  that tidbit in there of course watch millie weaver's videos they're up at news wars dot com info wars
[03:52:44.420 --> 03:52:48.980]  dot com millie does amazing work and she has for many years and my goodness it's so insane i've
[03:52:48.980 --> 03:52:54.180]  been watching her since i was much since i was a kid and now she's got kids of her own it's amazing
[03:52:54.180 --> 03:53:02.500]  how we all grow up in this amazing liberty movement but rod rozenstein has resigned the deep state
[03:53:02.500 --> 03:53:07.860]  apparently is in chaos as alex and i were talking about just a minute or two ago we've had something
[03:53:07.860 --> 03:53:14.420]  like 10 or 12 top deep state actors resigned in the last two weeks ever since the muller report
[03:53:14.420 --> 03:53:18.900]  was released in its redacted form we all learned there was no obstruction we all learned there was
[03:53:18.900 --> 03:53:25.380]  no collusion we learned some shocking things we learned for instance that the russians spent a
[03:53:25.380 --> 03:53:29.700]  very small amount of money in the wider scheme of things but they also spent them money pushing
[03:53:29.700 --> 03:53:39.780]  black lives matter pushing the lgbt qia a plus plus p agenda they were also pushing islam basically
[03:53:39.780 --> 03:53:45.780]  anything they could do including pushing bernie sanders to destroy america's societal cohesion
[03:53:45.780 --> 03:53:49.940]  and if you look around with that small amount of money they invested in those ads they seem to have
[03:53:49.940 --> 03:53:54.260]  been quite successful but i wanted to expand on something that i talked about with alex in the
[03:53:54.260 --> 03:54:00.180]  last segment rod rozenstein a lot of people have been critical about him since day one and with good
[03:54:00.180 --> 03:54:06.100]  reason he basically he had a 15 minute interview with the clinton's to determine if they lied to
[03:54:06.100 --> 03:54:13.140]  congress about the famous blue dress humidor monica lewinsky 15 minute interview so this happened
[03:54:13.140 --> 03:54:20.660]  obviously way back in the 90s but it's also worth mentioning that rozenstein basically lied because
[03:54:20.660 --> 03:54:26.980]  when that interview occurred rozenstein said he was working somewhere completely different
[03:54:26.980 --> 03:54:31.860]  that's what he told the trump administration when he got hired all the way back in 2017
[03:54:31.860 --> 03:54:37.460]  rozenstein has also been the guy who famously said oh what do you want me to do wear a wire should
[03:54:37.460 --> 03:54:42.500]  i wear a wire when i talk to president trump should i do i need to wear a wire this guy is
[03:54:42.500 --> 03:54:47.300]  he just look at his face and i know that this is a little bit like low hanging fruit but this guy
[03:54:47.300 --> 03:54:53.140]  does not look trustworthy to me he's raising his hand and he just looks like a weasel he really
[03:54:53.140 --> 03:54:59.780]  looks like a strange weasel creature so i'm glad that he's gone but was his resignation
[03:54:59.780 --> 03:55:06.340]  letter not very strange he thanked president trump for his humor he thanked president trump for his
[03:55:06.340 --> 03:55:12.020]  campaign promises and what he said at the inauguration he noted that he served longer than the majority
[03:55:12.020 --> 03:55:19.220]  of deputy ag's before him he said that the average span is just 16 months and he lasted a full 24
[03:55:19.220 --> 03:55:24.020]  it was very strange and he seemed to throw all kinds of america first rhetoric right back in
[03:55:24.020 --> 03:55:27.940]  the president's face and you can read that two ways you can read that one he's trying to say
[03:55:27.940 --> 03:55:31.940]  that he was really a patriot he was really working for america's best interests all along
[03:55:32.580 --> 03:55:38.340]  or you can read that as saying i'm going to code my language to insult the president i'm going to
[03:55:38.340 --> 03:55:44.020]  code my language to make it sound like president trump is the one not keeping his campaign promises
[03:55:44.020 --> 03:55:48.980]  and so i just find that absolutely fascinating and i am incredibly optimistic if you look at
[03:55:48.980 --> 03:55:56.180]  what's going on president trump is seemingly cleaning house and that's been needed for a very
[03:55:56.180 --> 03:56:01.860]  long time of course steve bannon said it was the original sin of the trump administration
[03:56:01.860 --> 03:56:06.100]  that in a desperate effort to staff the government as quickly as possible so they could enact the
[03:56:06.100 --> 03:56:10.660]  president's agenda they brought in all of these people who are essentially the deep state who
[03:56:10.660 --> 03:56:16.580]  are the republican establishment they have casick people working in the white house they have jeb
[03:56:16.580 --> 03:56:23.060]  bush and marco rubio clowns working in the white house so it looks like president trump is going
[03:56:23.060 --> 03:56:28.020]  to get some of these bad actors out of his path it looks like this country might really be on its
[03:56:28.020 --> 03:56:33.540]  way to an unfettered america first agenda and i personally hope that means the president is going
[03:56:33.540 --> 03:56:38.900]  to go after these big tech platforms for censoring alex jones and so many other fantastic people
[03:56:38.900 --> 03:56:43.620]  myself i'm still on facebook god emperor trump i'm still on twitter at real g e trump find me

[03:56:48.580 --> 03:56:53.220]  ago and it was flipped like a switch this wasn't a gradual decline you can look at the ratings and
[03:56:53.220 --> 03:56:57.940]  it goes being and then then down drops off like a rock we're still reaching millions and i'm thankful
